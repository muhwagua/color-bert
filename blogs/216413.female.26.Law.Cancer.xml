      No gym for a week, silly me. Was lazy at home - I simply had no time at all to fit in gym activities. Oh well. And yesterday and Monday were dead days for me. I was so down and out of it all, I couldn't even put myself together enough to make it to the gym.  Went to a Pump Class this morn, and it was nice, even though, for some reason, it wasn't as intense as last week. Don't know why. Tried to concentrate and focus on my muscles working, but it was different. Still good though, of course. I missed working out this past week.  Pump weigths: Warm Up:9kg / Legs (Squats):10kg / Chest:5kg / Back:9kg / Triceps 5kg & 2 1/2kg / Biceps:5kg / Legs (Lunges):5kg / Shoulders:4kg and 1kg each  Can add more weights to both leg work rounds. Finished up with 45 minutes on the crosstrainer, not more, as I hadn't had brekkie and was at the max of what's possible without fuel, really. More working out these next two weeks, as my one month check up (yay! the fat scale!) and Ev's arrival (yay! someone gets to see my body!) are nearing.

      I was a lazy bum Monday and Tuesday and for the first time in a while didn't go to the gym at least every other day. Oh well. For some reason, I just couldn't pick myself up - had awfully sore muscles Monday (especially my latissimus and the sides of my thighs were hurting) and felt like crap on Tuesday morn (hormonally induced, I am sure) and had no time Tuesday night as i had to play plumber for Tina trying to get her kitchen waste pipe going again (was as successful as you can be without the right equipment - note: kids, yes, hot water removes wax. however, lots of wax stays stuck in the drain pipe and causes floods. so DON'T DO IT.).  Anyway. I finally dragged myself to Pump this morning, and had a great time, - managed to get through the dreaded lunges without cramps, crying, stopping and with more weight than before - am very proud of myself, indeed. Added weight to warm up, back, bi&triceps, lunges and shoulders, and it was all good. I am sure I'll feel it in my shoulders tomorrow.  Pump weigths: Warm Up:7kg / Legs (Squats):10kg / Chest:5kg / Back:9kg / Triceps 5kg & 2 1/2kg / Biceps:5kg / Legs (Lunges):5kg / Shoulders:4kg and 1kg each  Hopped on the scale, and weighed less than before, too. Yay. Finished up with 45 minutes on the crosstrainer. And felt good, if terribly hungry. Yup, had missed out on brekkie again. Silly me. Have to figure out what to do work out wise when at home over the weekend, would love to swim, but that ain't possible because of the new piercing, so I reckon I will try to hit the gym with Cordu, we'll see whether I'll have time for that at all anyway.

      Went to the Gym this morn, to the usual Sunday morning Bodystyling class with Julia and a short 30 minutes on the Crosstrainer. Didn't feel like more today.  The class was good, even though we used those horrid Reebok Tubes , and that wasn't so nice during leg work. Have bad feeling towards my legs again. They are so large, and so muscular (with less jiggle after all), but hey, they are so  WEAK ! Argh. The leg lifts sucked. One third into them, the entire side of my thigh and bum were in a crampy state of pain. That has to change. Unfortunately the only way to do so is by going to the class and fighting my way through the legwork. Oh well. Weight work wise, with Pump twice a week, Bodystyling once a week and weight circuit all other times, my muscles should be getting enough diversity for the moment. Once my stamina is back on track, I'll also add Tae-Bo for the fun factor and killer intensity again. Don't want to get stuck in a movement rut, and with disbalanced muscles.  In any way, was nice this morn, even if I was almost in tears from the pain in my thigh/bum while figthing my way through the set. The 30 minutes on the Crosstrainer were just an add on, really, to loosen my muscles and get my metabolism going for a little while. No major fat-burning action going on.  Will prolly do some major stretching tonight, just because I have this feeling creeping up in my muscles already.  That much for the day. Tomorrow: Pump.

      Just came home from the gym. Did three rounds in the weight circuit (even though I felt like bailing out after two, and had decided halfway through round two that I'd only do two rounds), which included 180 crunches. Not too shabs, me thinks.  Followed up with 60 minutes on the crosstrainer on low intensity, reading "Marie Claire" and "Men's Health", the latter being highly entertaining, as it is just as bad as the female equivalents. Especially enjoyed the sex tips, this month, men were allowed to learn that yes, masturbation is ok, what's necessary for a sex-filled weekend with a lover (a hotel room, a razor, a dildo, a tape recorder) and how to educate women about female ejaculation and queefs (as if women didn't know that already). Lovely. Finished with some stretching in the testoserone loaden part of the weight room. Oy. They should really move the stretch area somewhere else; I hate the mirrored corner where the mats are now.   Took a good long time to get ready afterwards, and that was fine and splendid, too.  Odd thing: While I am starting to see my image in the mirror more and more critically (my self-blaming and self-hating mechanisms are in full swing) and hopped on the stupid scale again today, it's quite bizarre that I isolate what I see from how I feel. Standing under the super nice and hot gym shower today, I enjoyed the way my bod feels, the firmness and softness and shapelyness. I wish I could transfer that feeling to looking at myself. Duh.  Anyway. That much for now. Gym again tomorrow. :)

      Went to the gym yesterday, but decided to take a little break today, as I feel as if a bit of a flu is approaching, am freezing, even though  am sitting sinside with a beanie, my  urlLink bombers  scarf and a blankie.  Tina and I worked out together yesterday afternoon, did two rounds on the weight circuit and 50 minutes on treadmill and crosstrainer; finished up with some stretching. Felt awesome afterwards, but really needed a rest today. Good point of yesterday: didn't get on the scale. :)  Finally purchased the necessary supplements, too: a multivitamin, extra vitamin C plus zinc, silica and calcium. The multivitamin is self-explanatory; the vitamin C plus zinc is there to protect from the flu and the common cold and to help in healing my piercing; the silica is there for strong nails, hair, skin and firm connective tissue (all just for my dimply thighs, that might now that I am taking extra estrogen to prevent me from getting suicidal, get even dimplier than they already are - also purchased a full blown anti-cellulite magic potion; doubt it will work, but hey, everything is worth a try, hm?) and the calcium is there to help kickstart my the fat burning action of my metabolism. Yay. Supplements rule.  Feel pretty good in my skin today, even though my eating habits -surprise, surprise- were ultra shitty again today. My body feels nice and firm, especially my legs, abs and arms. Not too shabs. Only bad thing about my body today is the allergy hell that my hands are in at the moment. I won't give details about what happened, but it involved chemical substances used to dissolve hair and already dry, itchy skin with tiny scratches. Imagine the rest: it burned like hell and was bright ref. Have been smearing all kinds of healing properties on my fingers in an attempt to make them better. But ouch, ouch, ouch. Says she who-used-to-be-able-to-use-all-kinds-of-cosmetics-without-ever-having-allergy-troubles-but-who-now-gets-more-and-more-prone-to-allergies-as-she-gets-older. No more, no more. Those days are gone.  Better body news: tomorrow.

      Bailed out of the embarrassment of a step class on Tuesday. Didn't feel like it and was passive-aggressive all day: I know I should have gone and move my butt, but somehow, I just didnt manage to.  Went to the gym this morning though, for a nice little Pump class by Julia. The room was as cold as last time. Duh. Weights: WarmUp:7kg/Squats:9kg/Chest:5kg/Back:7kg/Triceps:4kg and 2 1/2kg/Biceps:4kg (could have handled more)/Lunges:4kg (next time: more)/Shoulder:2kg Later spend 45 minutes at low intensity on the cross trainer, as ordered by Daniel.  Wore shorts today (need to hop to the laundromat tomorrow, all other sports clothes were dirty, or not piercing compatible), and woah, I think there is some change in my legs already. I usually hate wearing shorts at the gym, these legs of mine simply are to scary when in motion, but hey, every once in a while, seeing them move in a mirror shows progress - so that's what I noticed today. Less wiggle on the inside of the thighs, right above the knee, definitely. Not bad, not bad, I think. Felt good during Pump, even though I went to the gym without any brekkie, not exactly a healthy thing to do. I really need to get a grip on that eating stuff - I eat irregulary, still haven't gotten the much needed supplements for lack of funds (already have hurting open bits in the corners of my mouth), and if and when I eat, I feel sick afterwards. Plus I stepped on the scale again, which I just shouldn't do. Once a month, at the check up - not every fucking time that I am there. I swear, I am back in the grip of the numbers again, and it's all my fault, too. Yeah. What a horribly teenage thing to do, I thought I had gotten over it at 16, and now I've quite easily, within a week, fallen back into the old habit of letting my happiness be dictated by what the scale says. - Could slap myself for this stupid behaviour.  Anyway. Overall, I should be happy: I worked out today, and that felt good, and I noticed some success, so that's fine and splendid. And I'll get the rest in check, somehow, too.

      Gave myself a gym break yesterday, and that was good. The recovery day helped my poor assaulted shoulders back on track, I guess. Had a good few hours at the gym today with Tina. Wanted to do Pump but as Beatrice was sick, we did 3 rounds of weight circuit again, and an hour on the treadmill (as all crosstrainers were occupied). Am now feeling reasonably ok, didn't quite mind my legs too much today. I didn't stretch enough again, and could again use a little massage...oh well. Just 4 more weeks, and I'll have someone at hand at all times to deliver these kinds of services.  While my working out habits are ok, my eating habits still suck though..... duh. I either don't eat, or I eat stuff without any nutritional value. Duh.  Anyway. More tomorrow. I guess I'll dare to go to a Step Class and in that case will have funny stories about falling over steps and making a complete and utter fool of myself.

      Have gotten over Thursday's shock of knowing my weight and body fat percentage, and also over the trainer's shitty and condescending tone.  - And have been working my little ass off at the gym, according to the boring little plan I have been ordered to adhere to. It's fear, I swear. And well, I guess the trainer's tactic has worked out, after all.  So on each gym visit, I've spend an hour on either the treadmill or crosstrainer, have fought my way 3 times through the weight machine circuit (leaving out one leg machine, as lying on there made my piercing living hell) and finished it up quite nicely with some stretching. - Uncortunately, not enough stretching, especially in my shoulder and lat region. Part of it is the cold weather, I guess. Longed for it, and now it's there silly me hasn't been diligent enough about wrapping up warmly enough (and not clever enough to turn the heater on on time, and not good enough about supplements that would make me less prone to soreness), especially not on my way home from the gym. I want a back massage with some nice smelling oil in a really really warm room now. From my toyboy, preferrably. Without me having to ask. And without me having to ask for more.  In any way, I've been working out lots, and am feeling pretty good bodywise. - Even though I hate the fact how much these stupid two numbers have influenced me already. Stepped on the scale at the gym again today (a different one than on Thursday), and while I was wearing more, it showed 2kg less than on Thursday. Odd. I guess one of them is wrong then. And duh, I should just not let it bother me at all.  More gym tomorrow. For tonight, I think a really hot shower and a self massage are in order again. Thankfully, I won't freeze to death in the bathroom anymore, as I finally figured out what the hell was wrong with the heater in there. One day, I will live in a house were the heating doesn't decide to go odd every few weeks, were there is hot water in unlimited supply, and where the heating can be regulated during the day, too. One fine day.  When that day arrives (will be a few years before I can afford all that), I will probably also have reduced my body fat % by 1/3.

      Daniel had me step on the scale & body fat percentage scale.  And it wasn't pretty. I share lots of things online, but that is something I do not want to share, simply because it is to scary. The thought of how much of my body is fat is......horrid.  So I've been put on a strict body fat reduction plan for the next 4 weeks (when I am allowed to step on that scale again); which will be boring as hell. I have basically been ordered to do boring stuff, at low intensity. I was told that if I wanted, I could do classes, too, but shouldn't expect results from them. Great. I will show that chap what results I can see in 4 fucking weeks!  I'll have nightmares of numbers tonight. - And share the details of that plan tomorrow. Duh. Not nice.

       Things I should bring up during Thursday's trainer appointment:     My main goal is literally  turning my life around . I've never been skinny, and due to the way my body is shaped, I will probably never be skinny, but I want to be fit. Really really fit. I do not want to continue life with the sort of bum and legs that I have now, and I know that I don't have to, because I have achieved some change before (namely back in 1998).   Symbolic for the physical (and mental) change I want to achieve is  riding up Mt.Ventoux  in the Provence in September next year. I can't and don't want to start cycling outside in this season (because of weather, and lack of bike), so my main goals over the winter will be (in order of importance):     loosing weight ; I weigh far too much to cycle up any mountain, and do not have a cyclist's body at all. I have strong legs and a strong torso (important for good transmission and stability), but I carry far too much extra around with me.   lowering body fat ; obviously. That's what all the extra weight is, after all. Am willing to carry muscles up that mountain, but not wobbly fat that will make me look horrid in bike shorts.   gaining stamina ; - by cycling & spinning classes, obviously, and time on the crosstrainer. I am not sure about amount of training and intensity though. What can I do to keep stamina/cardio training entertaining? What about classes other than spinning and about overtraining? - I have a tendency to push myself too hard, and work in a heart rate zone that is counterproductive.   gaining strength and toning up ; - but without bulking up my legs, which works way too well with my genetic and hormonal make up. Main target zones are my legs, bum and abs, - and I want some nice shoulders again, too. I don't need to target my arms too much, goinf BodyPump will take care of them well enough.   gaining flexibility ; I do not stretch enough. I would have loved to do Yoga, but Surya just isn't an instructor I can get along or feel comfortable with. Thankfully, I can do Yoga and Stretchig at home, too.    I do not have any health issues that stand counter to working out. My right shoulder was injured several years ago, but is pretty much fine, as long as I don't play Badminton or Tennis (or any sport with a stess on upward motion in the shoulder), which I don't plan on doing anyway. In contrast, I hope that regular working out witll help with my moods.   I do not want to become a  slave to the scale , as I used to have disordered eating in my teens, which brought me to the shape and size that I am now. I am well aware though, that I need the scale and the body fat percentage scale to help evaluate my success. It would be ok to weigh myself once or twice a month, but I do not want to base my success solely on weight. - I am far happier not worrying about numbers.   I need to change my  eating habits  again, which have really deteriorated as of lately. Less fat, no skipping meals, more veges, more fruit.   I am willing to invest lots of  time and effort  into achieving my goal. I am willing to go to the gym 4 to 5 times a week.    Things I enjoy : BodyPump, Spinning, Tae-Bo (once I am in better shape, that is), rather athletic stuff.     Things I don't enjoy : Work on the machines, free weights, standard Aerobics classes; anything with a Choreography (at least not on a regular basis).

      Bodypump class and an hour on the Crosstrainer today.  Went to the gym in the morn, and am now at home and feeling pretty good, if a bit tired, and still tense. Bodypump was with Julia, the class was full of people I know, and quite nice; however, the room was way too cold, and I am rather worried about what kind of effect that will have had on my muscles. I tried to push the boundaries weight wise a little: WarmUp: 7kg / Legs (Squats): 9kg / Chest: 5kg / Back: 7kg / Triceps: 4kg / Biceps: 4kg / Legs (Lunges): 4 kg / Shoulders: 2kg Managed, even though the squats, chest and triceps weights indeed were the absolute boundary. Struggled with the shoulder excercises, but then I always do, and refuse to go down with that weight.  All in all, it was good, even though I again had trouble with the lower ab excercises and some stretching moves because of the fresh piercing. Did other stuff during that time though. tis day 5 of being pierced, and as predicted, the initial infection is happening, even though it is far less severe than it was with Tinas belly-button, just some redness right were the ball rests, no crusting, no fluid. - Am still super diligent with regular warm saline soaks (3 times a day when possible), gentle cleaning with the cleaning solution and under the shower, disinfection after each cleaning, and clean, not too tight clothing over it.  After Pump, I thought I'd do 30 minutes on the Crosstrainer (wasn't in the mood for the bike today), but once the 30 minutes were over, I felt so good that I did 30 more minutes. Burned off rougly 700 kcal in 60 minutes, at Cardio Heart rate. - And was terribly hungry then. My stomach was growling while I was under the shower, I swear. My eating today was almost normal, if still not terribly good, had bread rolls for brekkie and some pasta with tomatosauce and mozzarella. Quite nice, even though I wasn't enjoying it but basiclaly ate to make that growling go away.  Anyway. Am pretty conten if tiredt, and now in relaxation and recovery mood until tomorrow night's trainer appointment. Need to figure out today what exactly I tell him I want to achieve (found out today that it's gonna be an appointment with Daniel, not Stephan, and I don't mind at all. Like Daniel much better.). Also need to treat myself to a hot shower and ayuvedic self-massage. - I really am so worried about soreness tomorrow, that cold room wasn't good.  All about my grandiose plans and goals later.

      Am feeling pretty well physically today.  My mind is already playing me tricks and telling me that I already look and feel tons better. :) While my muscles indeed react shockingly quickly to exercise (prolly because of all that testosterone that would usually be flushing through my system), all I feel now is probably just that nice tense, worked at feeling my muscles get a few days after a workout. - Just my shoulder muscles hurt a little. I could do with a little back rub now.  Just came back from a Bodypump class held by Beatrice, who is still the boring, unimaginative instructor she has always been. - But then, it really doesn't matter much with Bodypump, as the instructor doesn't get to make any choices in regards to the class anyway. Was a nice class, I just love how my body knows the entire set, and falls back into the exercises quite easily (and I just love the "clean and press"), - even though I realised that I was weight wise pretty much at the embarrasing low max of what I can currently do (Warm up: 5kg/ Squats: 7kg/ Chest: 4kg/ Back: 5kg/ Triceps: 4kg/ Biceps: 4kg/ Lunges: 4kg/ Shoulders: 2kg). It was still fun, and I am nicely exhausted.  Managed to do the entire class quite nicely, even though I was overly cautious in regards to my piercing: during the ab section, all things sideways were rather uncomfy, and I was super cautoious with all Rowing exercises - If you do them too enthusiastically (and in the wrong way) you can easily hit yourself in the navel region with the barbell each and every time. Duh. Before the class, I spend 10 minutes on a spinning bike and 20 minutes on the crosstrainer, burning a decent 300Kcal on the latter (and following my own 1/3 needs to be on the bike rule). - The WarmUp in Pump usually just isn't enough and I end up with icky sore muscles, and with the slight discomfort in my shoulders from yesterday, some low impact cardiostuff seemed like a good option before the class.  Anyway.  We'll see tomorrow whether it has paid off or not. No working out tomorrow, btw. - I need to give my poor hurting navel a bit of a rest. And a nice warm saline soak now.  Foodwise, today was unsuccessful: I almost ate nothing, and what I ate wasn't top class at all. I really need to get some change into this eating business. - But again, food didn't feel quite right. Duh. Tomorrow has to be better.

       "Healthy Habits": Goals for the next two weeks:      Four work outs at the gym per week; after strength exercise classes, I should try (if time allows is) to get at least 30 minutes of additional cardiowork; after a cardiotraining session (namely after spinning), I should try (if time allows) to get at least some ab work and additional thorough stretching.  Moving from the crosstrainer to the spin bike; I need bike training over the winter if I want to do Mont Ventoux. At least one third of my cardio time should be on the bike, increasing to half of it by the end of December.  Food: Getting rid of my "Bisc Twix" & nutella rusk habits, stop skipping brekkie, lowering my intake of Pepsi light, adding more fruit and veges and pro-biotic yogurt, having healthier bread again, avoiding the cereal rut.  Getting diligent with supplements: need to buy multivitamins, silica, zinc.  Prettyness: 'tis winter - time for moisturising to prevent lizardisation and finishing the shower cold (which will be hard until I get the heater in the bathroom repaired). eeeeek.    Enough goals, me thinks.

      Dragged myself to the gym this morning, even though I woke up already trying to tell myself out of it. The usual, on a Sunday morning, after some early morning insomnia (4am, to be exact), and some more sleep from 6:30 to 9am.  But I went. And that was good.  Had a class of Bodystyling run by Julia (who is my faourite instructor) and spend another 30 minutes on the crosstrainer afterwards. Was a good class, the people there were not quite the usual Sunday morning crowd, lots of new faces, and I didn't quite feel so alone by beeing in not top shape yet. Warm-up was fine, the squats were fine, I struggled (as usual) with the leg things, enjoyed the ab stuff (my piercing only hurt during lower ab excercises, so I did other ab stuff instead) and did surprisingly well during the much hated leg-lifts. Back stuff hurted a bit again (lying on my stomach just doesn't quite do it yet, not because of pain, but just dicomfort...and I worry about the piercing a bit much, I guess), and Stretching just felt divine. In all, a good class, just what I expected, and I felt pretty good throughout it; even though I had the usual "gah, how long will it take now" thing during the second leg round.  Finished afterwards with 30 minutes on the crosstrainer, basically in fat burning mode, all rather relaxed, reading Focus.  Feel good now, even though I already feel some soreness developing in my upper abs. No wonder. Also got myself a trainer appointment for Thrusday, to discuss all my giant goals with someone and get some pro advice. Let's see what that will be like. Am a bit worried because I am pretty sure that Stephan, the trainer, will want me to hop on scales (and the fat % scale, too) and I just do not want to know what I weight, because I spend long long enough years being way too worried about the number on a scale in the morning. I don't really care as to what I currently weigh, I feel relatively good, if in worse shape than in summer.  Does my actual weight matter? Not really. Let's see whether he can weigh me and not tell me what it is. -I am not worried that I immediately fall into "I need to know what I weigh" mode, but I really don't want to take any chances here.  More later.

      Repost from the  urlLink real blog  from a  few days ago....Just to illustrate what this Mont Ventoux thing is all about....   In another effort to lift my mood, I started my search for some more info to prepare my ride up Mont Ventoux late next year. Trying to plan the impossible, basically.  Have finally started looking at the logistical side of things  (take someone with me? if so, who? stay where? stay how long? - The only thing I am sure about is that I'll go in september, off season, less tourists, less heat) , which shouldn't be underestimated, even though that stuff is marginal if I look at the physical side of things.  I have no idea how I can make it.  Apart from needing a new bike, I need to loose a good amount of weight (15kgs or whatnot), as there is no way I'll carry all what's on my hips at the moment up on that mountain (or all the mountain's that I'll do in preparation of it). No way at all. I guess it'll all sort itself out over the months as I get into work-out and training mode (and spend all of my free-time on a bike), but right now, it all looks like a mountain even higher than Ventoux itself.  The more that I look into all the details of this grandiose plan, the more jittery and frightened I get. I think I have gone insane, plainly speaking. Just take a look at the pictures and reports of people who've already done it, like  urlLink Inge Johannessen from Norway ,  urlLink Toivo Lagerweij and Marjolijn Kieft, two of the makers of eurocols.com  (a fab personal site on Cols all over Europe),  urlLink Alex, the maker of this excellent dutch website on Ventoux  (could someone please translate the entire site for me?) and  urlLink Gerry from London . If you still haven't realised what a giant thing that is, check out this great site on the mountain  urlLink Mont Ventoux: géant provencal .  I am insanely jealous, and insanely motivated, too. And a little shocked: there is ONE thing I am motivated for!  But I wonder: Why in all the world do I want to ride THAT mountain? For what purpose? I really am not completely sure. Fighting my demons, I guess. Accomplishing  something obvious . Standing above the world. At least, I already have an awful lot of respect for that mountain. Otherwise, this would be even more insane than it is anyway.

      ....after several weeks of being down in the Blues, I finally managed to get a work out again.  Was about time. It's less than 6 weeks before Ev arrives, and while I know he likes me the way I am, I'd prefer to be in good shape when I hit the sheets for the first time in...10 months  So today was the start of that, a gentle start. Tina and I had a little lunch time workout, 45 minutes of cardiowork on the crosstrainer, some stretching, and some ab work. And now I feel awesome. I know my mood is better when I work out, so..... I hope getting going again will help with my mood, too.  All is well.

      The killer Bodystyling session from Sunday (which I didn't post about: killer, killer killer session with Julia,  focused on bum and back followed by 30 minutes crosstrainer action) left me with very sore buns and legs, bailed out of working out yesterday, but thankfully forced myself this afternoon. Did two rounds on the weight circuit and 45 minutes on the crosstrainer. Not *that* much, but more than enough for my still from the flue recovering body. Finished with some decent stretching afterwards.  Hopped on the scale again, which indeed still showed the 9 pounds less. Amazing.  In any way, working out was nice, and it felt great to lie on the floor surrounded by mirrors which reflected the awesome moody dusk outside: the sky was pinkish-blue and foggy and wintery. Very nice. Still don't like look in the mirror much: I can like my upper body and abs lots, but really, my lower half (while already slimmer and firmer) still pretty much sucks. These hips will always be there: with a pelvis like this, there is no getting away from it. These legs will never be longer. I am again starting to like my lower half more, but well, it ain't easy, it ain't easy. Anyway. No whining. Working out was nice, and wasted some time, too, that I would otherwise had spent waiting. Sigh. Unbelievable. Tomorrow.  Will waste some more time with Pump and an hour on the crosstrainer tomorrow morning. I fear that otherwise I will go insane waiting until it's time for me to hop on the train.

      First workout in a week.  Started gently with 2 rounds in the weight circuit, 30 minutes on the crosstrainer and lots of stretching. Was more than enough for the start, I really didn't feel like more: was too hot, had breathing trouble, and the noise at the gym sure wasn't nice to bear half deaf (my ears are really troubling me at the mo).  In any way, I went, and that's good, and what was shocking was the discovery that I have now lost a good 9 pounds to what I weighed in at when I had my appointment with Daniel . Not bad. Wonder whether it was all muscle I lost while mainly in bed this past week. Wonder what the body fat percentage scale will now say. Oy.  Anyway. More gentle gym tomorrow. I will look good in bed soon. Very soon. :)

      So my plan of working out every day until Ev's arrival was halted by my body. I've been super sick since Monday, and won't make any attempt to head to the gym before Saturday, just to take things slowly.  I hope these past 4 days of boredom and laziness have not completely harmed my abs. sigh.

      Blogged my little heart out in honour of World AIDS Day at the  urlLink real blog  yesterday and hence didn't get around to updating here. Still have a computer overdose, I think. Am getting dizzy from staring at the thing. Or maybe because I haven't been eating right yet aain, who knows, even though I think I did remarkably well today, in comparison to the last weeks.  Finally managed to drag myself to the gym late yesterday afternoon, after simply not being able to make myself go on Thursday and Friday. Bad me. Made a vow to go to the gym every singly day until Evan arrives on the 12th. Yesterday, I did two rounds on the weight circle and an hour on the crosstrainer. As it was closing time by then already, I didn't get around to do stretching, and I definitely felt that today, especially in my lat & lower shoulder muscles again. Overall, it was fine, but I really had to fight my way through the sit-ups. The fact I had barely eaten all day probably didn't help much either with all of it. While on the crosstrainer, I kept discussing with myself in my head whether I shouldn't just stop earlier, but fought my way through it, and that surely was good.  Today, I went to the usual Sunday morning Bodystyling class with Julia and finished up with an hour on the crosstrainer, too. Was a very hard class this morn, indeed (the squats were squats from hell, and the ab work for once was challenging. couldn't do the triceps push ups though), and I also realised that as soon as I look at myself in the mirror, my coordination is gone. While doing that, I realised that I don't have enough muscle tension during certain movements, and really that's what I need to work on. Stability and strength come from tension. And please, it simply looks better, too. Was very annoyed by the other people in the class. The super skinny blonde was there again, and shit, she always works out next to me, and I hate it. She is just so *tiny* and full of muscles and killingly flexible. Argh. I know, I shouldn't focus on other people, not get competetive or whatever else when working out, but see it as a positive thing for *me*, but for some reason, I can't. Whatever it is. It feels like a sliding down a slippery slope kind of thing, when teamed up with my eating habits. Made the mistake of eating before working out: had a reasonable amount of Special K with low fat milk, and shit, did I feel bad later on. The idea of cutting out dairy is sounding more and more promising to me, now that Heather has reported it doing good things for her. Apparently, Michelle is vegan, too, and woah, she looks awesome. Sigh. I wonder though, whether I could do that. My eating is shitty anyway, and restricting whole food groups (I am already doing that partly anyway, to be honest) just doesn't sound like the wisest idea right now, I don't know. It would mean no more low fat potato soup, the main meal I've cooked these past weeks, and no added yoghurt to sauces etc, if I get back to cooking when Evan is here. Really am not sure. I might want to give it a try, just for a week or so, to see whether I can do it, and what it does to me, don't know. *sigh*  Tried making the appointment with Daniel for my 4 week check up and the beloved body fat scale, but they didn't have plans out for next week yet. Hm. Not really looking forward to it. Seriously. I know there is change in my body. I see it, I feel it. My back looks better  and it sounds very odd, but while stretching at Pump on Wednesday, I was stroking my ribcage and side, and it felt new and good, my arms feel better, even my legs do, my abs look stunning, my skin is nice and firm (which really is a shocking development, unfortunately, I don't know what causes this: the supplements, the working out, the body lotion, the anti-cellulite potion, the silicone massage brush, the moisturising in general..). I wonder though, whether my success can be measured with the tools at hand, i.e. the scale (made the mistake to hop on there last night, and while it wasn't the killer number it was at the first check up, it wasn't nice either) and the body fat scale at all. What will I do if it doesn't show on there, all my working out and cutting down on foods and whatever else?  Am scared.  And I already know that no matter what, on the day of the appointment, I will not eat at all and severly cut down on my fluid intake before I hop on that body fat thing. I remember during my first check up ever, that the gal told me that that scale only showed reliable results when you had a completely empty stomach, in the morning. Duh. Daniel only does appointments in the evening. How nice.  Anyway. Pump tomorrow. I will work out every day until Ev arrives. The Mantra is:  I want to look good naked.

      it's still very hot, and going to the gym would still be insane.  as a substitute, i went to the pool early in the morning, before the sun started to be all evil. swam lenghts for a good 60 minutes, mainly breaststroke (the only fair stroke in a full pool), with few breaks. took extra time to correct my technique.  all in all, a nice experience. i love that certain pool, the air was warm, the water refreshingly cool, and when i started out at 7:30am, it wasn't too full yet. felt good to move, felt good to be surrounded by water, felt good to just float and not feel gravity for a while, felt good to be cool. all very lovely.  tomorrow, i'll go again (unless the thunderstorms kick in already), just 30 minutes earlier, to avoid the crowds that came in by 8am.  only downside: when towelling off afterwards, the leftovers of my fake tan came off too, and left even more vitiligo-like bits of skin behind.  must have been the soaking in the water for a good hour. quite annoying.  can't this happen evenly?  anyone any ideas how to speed up cell turnover? i'm already using my silicone body brush in the shower every time but still have these discoloured patches everywher). rubbing myself off with lemon juice doesn't quite seem like a good option, hm? i really want to get another layer of tan on (after a few days of moisturising my little heart out), but don't dare to, before all this blotchiness has gone.....

      Lovely work-out free weekend (you know, long walks along the lac leman and the rhone aside). And now I find myself being unabel to work out, because we're in the middle of a more than 30°C heatwave. They predict 37°C for today and tomorrow, which means either working out before dawn or not at all.  In addition, my shoulders are so badly sunburned that I can't move my arms without wimpering. So a break for me. I hope I can make myself enjoy it, too.

      Felt yesterday's pump class comfortably in my muscles today, just the right amount of after-work-out tension. Lovely.  Today, I first did 20 minutes on the crosstrainer, set in intervall, just warm up my comfortably achy muscles and get my metabolism going.  Then circuit class with Bettina, which was really good. We started out with about 20 minutes of warm-up and cardio activity on the step, then -in teams of two- did one round of 2 minutes each at 8 stations, which were PUMP moves with barbell, ab work and one coordination excercise. Then another 15 minutes of step, before we did a final 1 minute each round, cooldown and stretching.  It was a nice & taxing class, much more taxing then I had anticipated when Bettina told me yesterday what she had planned for this morning. I sure preferred this to a pure step class. During the step phase I realised though that no one had elevated their steps but me. I honestly couldn't remember whether I had accidently grabbed an already elevated step or had automatically elevated it like we have to for PUMP. Odd.  Psychologically, it was a good day at the gym, too: felt strong, and had a good time looking at myself in the mirror. Wore a tank top, and could nicely watch my arms during the exercise, which was quite a motivator. Hope I wasn't too  "in your face"  with the lady who was my teammate, who just started out at the gym and who hence always used a lot lighter weights then me. Would hate to come across as horrible as the skinny blonde who annoys me so much. Ugh.  Anyway: feeling good. Hope I will feel good even though I can't go to the gym the next three days. Will subsitute with Yoga and a few simple strength and stretchiong exercises at home.

      Considering I got dizzy again while working out today, I researched a wee bit (and will discuss this with Ev, too). And duh, looks like it's quite simple and nothing serious:   urlLink WebMD: Dizzy during Exercise    2. The problem could be from lack of food. For instance, if you work out in the morning, without having breakfast, and it's been 10-12 hours without a meal, then you can easily get dizzy from lack of fuel. You need, at least, to eat a snack if it's been several hours since you've eaten before a workout. Half a bagel, a banana, oatmeal, or toast 30-45 minutes before the workout should help. You'll have to see what works best.    I assume the wee protein shake i have in the morn is used up after 2 hours of vigorous exercise. No wonder then. Maybe I should have a gatorade between crosstrainer & class to not tun on empty. Duh.  Unhealthy habits on my part here.

       today:   60 minutes on the crosstrainer, in intervall mode, which was enjoyable, taxing and fun. chatted with some of the bodybuilding chaps about soccer while working out, insulted a french boy about les bleues but in turn received the compliment that i resembled louis figos wife. oh, how i wish. :)  then 60 minute pump class with bettina. worked with relatively high weights, because i didn't want to leave the class feeling like i didn't do enough.  weights per side: warm up 3 1/2 kg legs 5kg chest 2 1/2 back 3 1/2 triceps 2 1/2 biceps 2 1/2 shoulders 2 legs 3 1/2  can attempt more when doing legs next time. during the final ab work, i finally felt yesterday's ab class. had been quite dissapointed when getting up this morn and *not* being sore. after the first round of crunches though, i felt each and every crunch i did yesterday. not bad, really.  feel good right now. wore shorts today, and was quite impressed by my legs. sounds pretentious, i know, but it's good to see my giant muscles being good at doing something, i.e. squats.  tomorrow: circuit training. woohoo.

      time to update the workoutlog, isn't it?  first of all: i have worked out since last posting here, fear not. i haven't been sitting around doing nothing for the past 6 months. i have, however, changed my plans regarding mt.ventoux and my fitness goals and hence didn't feel the urge to specifically note how i was progressing. i still want to do mt.ventoux by bike one fine day, but quite simply not this year. i had planned on going up ther ein september, but opted to go to australia to be with my partner instead. no matter how much i want to ride up that mountain, my partner is a lot more important than that mountain. thankfully, i will also not be going to this years tour de france stage up mt.ventoux and hence won't ruin the experience for the future. :)  however, i've been busy working out these past months. the last 6 weeks were especially good, i worked out almost every day, mostly combining a strength class with an hour of aerobic activity, lost several pounds and feel pretty good about my body most of the time. they bought a new scale at the gym though, so i have no idea as to how much my weight has really changed. am still struggling with the scale though, no matter what. should just not get on it more than once a week.  so all is pretty ok, work out wise.  so for the record which shall be kept with all due accuracy again:  today: 30 minute ab class with jana, which was ultra hard but worked through every muscle in my abs. hadn't had such an intense ab workout in months - my abs have always been strong, and it takes high intensity excercises and lots of variation to really get at them. also did 30 minutes on the crosstrainer both before and after the class, on high intensity mountain/intervall setting, which i handled pretty well. so all is good. wonder how sore my abs will be tomorrow. :)  still need to work on my eating habits though: while i've been good at changing my brekkie habits and said goodbye to overeating on cereals that left me sick from the milk, i still have a tendecy to overeat: need to make sure not to skip my scheduled snacks between meals. also need to up my fruit and vege intake to replace the nutrition bars i'm currently downing all the bloody time.  that much for now.

      wasn't in the mood to turn on the puter when coming back from the gym last night.  yesterday, i did my usual monday program of a 60 minute pump class with bettina, followed by a 60 minute step class by claudia.  pump was fun, we did a different -old- set, which had fab music and was a lot harder than the one thy currently use.   weights per side  warm up 3 1/2 kg  legs (squats) 6 kg  chest 3 1/2 kg  back 4 1/2 kg  triceps 3 1/2 kg  biceps 3 1/2 kg  shoulders 2 1/2 kg / 2 1/2 for side lifts  legs (lunges) 5 kg   step was good, too. only downside is that i hate the jumping/running bits between the seperate step sections - it makes me feel all wobbly and jiggly and yuck. need an even better sports bra, i guess. urgh.  today, i did my three weight rounds, which were okay, went to a 45 minute step class by andrea and finished off with a 30 minute ab class. all good. i liked step, however, andrea was rather quick with step changes, so quick, that the other (bigger) lady in the class got very frustrated because she couldn't keep on. as a result, andrea toned both impact and speed down significantly, so that i didn't get as much out of it as i had hoped for. oh well. overall however, two good gym days.

      i decided to take a rest day from the gym today. needed it, muchly, and tried to not feel bad about it.  last night, i went to a 60 minute combined step and bum class and a 30 minute ab class, both by sanne.  step was very enjoyable and lovely, i really get a kick out of it these days, and am getting better, steadily. the bum exercises were nice, too, if hard. the ab class was as enjoayble as usual, and i was all strong and hardly needed any breaks.  more working out tomorrow. i needed today for stuff around the house and just getting over yesterday's news. still all raw. - worried that letting go of my anger might result in a breakdown. hence throwing stuff away and tidying up instead.  tomorrow: bodystyling class and crosstrainer: shall be fun.

      call me obsessed.  this morning, after 20 minutes on the crosstrainer (250 kcal burned) i went to a beginner's class run by bettina - we did 40 minutes aerobics and then some simple strength exercises, mainly for legs and abs. it was a nice class, if not terribly hard at all. at least it was communicative and fun.  tonight, after lots of whining on the phone to tina and my mom about whether i should go to yoga (both telling me no), i decided to drag myself to the gym again. good decision - i throughoutly enjoyed the 90 minute yoga class. i'm not sure what caused my whining this afternoon, whether it was laziness shining through, or needing another reason to go (i.e. rebelling against parents & tina) or whatever else. i do feel quite strange for having been at the gym twice today. and i feel weird about the fact that when i had decided not to go, for a short while around 6pm, i did not feel good, or relaxed or relieved or whatever. i just hated myself for these few minutes, telling myself i was lazy, that i had planned to go to yoga and should stick to it, and that i was letting the instructor down because i told her last saturday that i would be there today. so indeed, at the very last minute, i put on my fleece jumper, threw my stuff into a bag, put on my coat and was out the door before i could change my mind again. still, waiting for the bus, i was tempted to go back home, but i didn't. very very strange, what my mind was doing with me there today.  yoga calmed me down though, and grounded me, and was very enjoyable. regretting not going (as in those few minutes when i didn't want to go) would have been quite appropriate. i realised again that i really like the movements, the stretching, the resting and the meditation, and bettina is a wonderful, gentle instructor (very very different from the annoying instructor who was there last year). her corrections are gentle and calm, and moving my hip with the tip of her already noticed some improvement  at the end of the class, we did a guided meditation during which we were guided into imagining a sun radiating from our heart, warmth and light filling our bodies and the room and then - finally - reaching people that we love. i saw my love being guided, like via satellites, across mountains to tina in graz, across continents and oceans to evan, still in bed, being awakened by the sun. it was absolutely awesome.  in any way, i am happy that i went, despite all that strange behaviour on my part this afternoon. guess another reason behind it was being very tired from lack of sleep (caused -no doubt- by the full moon) and having just had a nap... i don't know.  let's just hope it doesn't happen again. am not sure whether this was a sign that i've been overdoing it, this subconscious not wanting to go or whatever. oh well, will see how it'll be in the next few days.

      wanted to do spinning today, but the instructor was sick. considering that i was already at the gym, i went to a tae-bo class instead.  great decision. i wasn't exactly planning on doing any tae-bo any time soon (thinking it was too still too hard & yadayadayada), but it rocked and was probably better than spinning for me today, even though it meant that my plans to do nothing but cardio today was slashed by it. it is some kind of strenght training, after all.  in any way, i throughoutly enjoyed it, not just because i felt all evil and strong and mean (and i swear, that's what i feel like when punching and kicking and shouting) but also because i enjoyed looking at my arm muscles. he. it was quite taxing, actually, and three quaters through the hour, i really was pretty much out of energy to kick. forced myself though, and did -overall- ok, i reckon. really liked the instructor, dirk, who didn't do tons of bizarre combinations, but instead few combinations, taking time to get into them and focus on doing them right.  loved the fact that i actually have strenght to punch and kick and push and hold my fists up the entire time. lovely. not (sorry about that, but yes, i compared myself again) like the much skinnier girls who had no strength to be bad and to kick and to punch. left me quite content, bad me. strentgth was very much a non issue today, just stamina was.  should try to fit some more tae-bo in. the question, however is: when? should see. would be fun to do it at least once a week. - too bad it clashes with pump (on mondays) and yoga (on thursdays), and on wednesdays, when i could do both tae-bo and pump, it clashes with - oh horror, buffy. maybe i should simply do weight circuit before. or do pump in the morn and be freaky enough to go back in the evening to do tae-bo.  in contrast to the good workout (not only was i left feeling strong and evil, but also throughoutly worked out, warm and soft), my eating was a bit odd today, kept grazing for much of the day and consumed more than i should have i think. not good. needed nuts today. strange. also should avoid having gatorade again: plain water is much better during a workout.

      some more working out today, without evil stomach pain this time (if a crampy right thigh).  did three rounds on the weight circuit, with some higher weights (triceps, legs, chest) than last time. worked out well, even though, as mentioned, my right thigh got all sore. duh.  later went to a 45 minute step class by sanne, which was as enjoyable as the one last week. quite a thriller. did the same choreography, and the final round -to the sound of "can't get you out of my head" was so enjoyable and energizing tha ti still had energy to sing along. i guess i have finally got a hang of this step thing. strange! :)  to top off, i stayed for the 30 minute ab class, which was fabulous, too. hard enough, entertaining enough. kept imagining myself in a bikini when things got difficult. hello, my name is carolin, and yes, i exercise to look good on the beach.  am pondering whether i should just work out for one hour tomorrow. can't go in the morn, because i have a dentist appointment. first though my options in the evening were spiining followed by pumo, however it's buffy time by 9pm, so.... reckon i'll either just do spinning, or do weight rounds, then spinning. am leaning towards the first a wee bit. - might be a good idea to not do weight training for a day for a change.  anyway: these thoughts are proof i am not seriously overexcercising yet:  buffy still rates higher than pump.

      i'm not sure whether i should call myself determined or plain stupid...  spend two hours at the gym today, doing two 60 minute classes: first pump, then a reebok step one.  pump, run by bettina, was nice. decided to up the weigths for the legs, just because i did not feel like i had reached the border of my stength before. - and yes, partly because evan was planning on joining a body pump class at his gym, too, and kept kidding me about i being a "girlie" class. he. would have loved to see him struggle - i bet his endurance strenght is by no means as good as he thinks it is. in any way, upping the weigths was a good decision, 6 kg for squats, and 5 for lunges is just about difficult enough. might be able to put more on both chest and back next time. the arm & shoulder weights are borderline, and rightly so.   weights per side  warm up 3 1/2 kg legs (squats) 6 kg chest 3 1/2 kg back 4 1/2 kg triceps 3 1/2 kg biceps 3 1/2 kg shoulders 2 1/2 kg / 2 1/2 for side lifts legs (lunges) 5 kg  in any way, today i felt like i had worked out after pump, and that was much needed. strange little moment during pump: while doing the lunges, my calves looked like someone elses calves, all firm and nice. :) also, during back exercises or so, for a change i looked for my reflection in the window instead of the mirror, and took a few moments to recognize that the one in the black pants, the striped shirt, the pigtails and the okay looking legs was me. he. good moments.  the step class was run by claudia, and not particularly difficult, just about right both intensity & choreography wise. however, about 5 minutes into the class, i developed major stomach pain in my lower left abdomen and was close to just putting the step away and leaving. here's where my determination versus stupidity thing comes in: i forced myself through it. after a while, the pain did go away. odd. it was too low for being caused by wrong breathing, and by the time it happened, it had been more than 2 hours since my last snack, too.  should definitely see a doc about my stomach troubles, the only question is: which doc? i really don't feel like going to my looser homeopathy gp, again, but feel even less like doc shopping from the yellow pages. duh. plus going to the doc would involve giving details about my eating habits, which i just don't feel like at the moment. in any way, no matter what, if it doesn't get better -and i just doubt that it will, because as soon as immodium acute stops working, it's the same story all over again, including nasty cramping and pain- i absolutely have to see one. have given myself ultimatums before, and haven't adhered to them, and that has to stop. must be the unconscious worry about getting a colonoscopy to see what's wrong/having crohn's/whatever else might be behind it. i wish it's ibs and i'd get antidepressants again. woopee. however, there is no way around going to a doc. need to remind myself of my parent's friend's daughter who died of colon cancer at 19.  anyway, enough about my gi tract.  once the pain went away, all was okay and the class passed by in a sec. noticed that i started to get annoyed by one other participant in the class, who has the longest limbs in the whole wide world. it's nothing but jealousy, and i know it. the anorexic girl was there again, too. she was already sweating on the spinning bike when i walked into the gym, did cardio all while i was doing pump and then joined the step class, too, being the one doing the extra jumos, lifting her arms and legs higher than everyone else. i am a bit worried because none of the trainers , instructors or supervisors seems to have ever approached her in the three years or so that she has been loosing all that weight. these days, she resembles  urlLink princess victoria of sweden in her worst days : all bones and nose and skinny shoulders. and she has  urlLink lanugo . scary.  but then - nothing i can do, i guess. am in no position to comment.  anyway. i am feeling quite okay now, had some rice to prevent feeling sick again, like last week, am sipping away on water, all is well.  more step tomorrow. hooray.

      was a good gym girl.  yesterday, i was sane enough to downsize my insane plans, and just do 2 rounds of weight circuit (instead of three), no cardio (instead of an hour) and just an additional 90 minutes of Yoga. I just didn't feel like doing cardiowork yesterday, so i tried to not feel guilty for being such a quitter and breaking my vows of cardio every day on the first note, and instead see it as a bit of a rest day. wasn't one, exactly, but i just didn't want to loose the great wide open feeling i had after yoga by doing some ordinary cardio afterwards. the weight rounds went by quickly, i put on a little more weigth than last time. however, i noticed again that i got a bit stressed while working out, worried to be too late for the class. duh.  the yoga class rocked. liked the instructor, and it was calm and just the right amount of difficulty. enjoyed it very much and will go every thrusday night now. such a great addition to all the usual stuff i do, really enjoyed the slowness and the stretching and the different moves. realised how much i missed yoga - but then, i dropped out of it last time because i hated the instructor and because the class rarely happened because of lack of participants, not because i hated yoga. the only downside of the class was the temperature in the room: it was way too cold. way too cold. i was freezing throughout the relaxation at the beginning and the end, especially because i walked in straight from weight training. complained afterwards. will bring warm top next time.  today, i spend an hour on the crosstrainer (760 kcal burned), before joing a 60 minute bodystyling class by julia. worked out with the barbell today, and that was nice. almost like a small pump class. :)  now, i already feel the soreness crawling into my muscles - especially right around my pelvic bones. ouch. should do some more stretching and relaxing today, i guess.  very much looking forward to both a pump and a step class tomorrow. feeling so much better about my body already. 3 1/2 more weeks of this intense workout level, and i should feel good about hitting the beach.

      today's workout: 60 minutes crosstrainer, 60 minute bodystyling class  the cardiostuff on the crosstrainer was fine, did intervalls, at level 5-7, burned 760 kcal or so. enjoyable. could have pushed myself further though, and that is a sucky feeling to have after a workout, i reckon. downside was, that something was wrong with my shoes today, just couldn't get comfortable feet, and that started to really bother me during the lunges in the bodystyling class. hurt like hell. i actually think it's too blame on the sports socks i wore - realised today that they must have shrunk massively in the dryer and are so non-stretchy now, that my toes invitably get cramped in them. add to that now a badly laced workout boot. gah. will not wear the socks anymore.  the bodystyling class was hence quite hampered. also couldn't concentrate and just wasn't too thrilled about doing the same old moves yet again. don't know. just couldn't be bothered, really. quite alarming - i need to concentrate and focus better, it just isn't worth spending time in a class at gym if i don't make the most of it. grr. am a wee little bit angry with myself about this, actually. duh.  anyway. will do better tomorrow, when i am planning on doing three rounds weight circuit, an hour of cardio on the crosstrainer and a 90 minute yoga class.  lock me up, i am overexercising, hooray.

      good morning at the gym: unexpected pump class!  started out with 60 minutes on the crosstrainer, reading men's health (their sex tips are just as bad as those in cosmopolitan) and burning 750 kcal. hooray.  the introduction class run by bettina turned out to be a normal pump class, just with a real warm up, with the music a tad bit slower and no clean and press in the back exercise section.   weights per side  warm up  3 1/2 kg legs (squats) 5 kg chest 3 1/2 kg back 4 1/2 kg (no clean & press) triceps 3 1/2 kg biceps 3 1/2 kg shoulders 2 1/2 kg legs (lunges) 3 1/2 kg  all very enjoyable, no pain, no soreness from yesterday. felt a bit odd though, because i was the one with the heaviest weights in that class. oy. all weights felt ok though - apart form the triceps one, maybe, but  then i've been wanting to up the weights for more impact. might up the weight for the squats. should decide on monday.  that aside, i enjoyed it, mainly because i enjoyed looking at me in the mirror, for a change. wore my purple top, and kept staring at my shoulders and arms, which *did* look good, i reckon, all muscluar and firm. i'll never be skinny-skinny, but firm and muscular, i can live with. :)  am still taking it a bit easier foodwise, btw, and that has been good, too. feel better, even though i still have major tummy trouble. hmph.

      good workout again today.  started out with 25 minutes on the crosstrainer before joining a pump class run by julia. enjoayble, as usual. put more weights on the barbell and tried to concentrate better in order to make the workout more efficient and harder. again, it was not *that* difficult, though. either need to use even more weights, or accept that i only get the real "kick" from intense cardio classes these days.   weights per side  warm up 3 1/2 kg legs (squats) 5 kg chest 3 1/2 kg back 4 1/2 kg triceps 2 1/2 kg biceps 2 1/2 kg shoulders 2 legs (lunges) 3 1/2  afterwards, i did another 35 minutes on the crosstrainer (calories burned total: 780). need to remind myself that -while the weight training is good and fun- the cardio is what burns fat and that i need to do at least 45, ideally 60, minutes of it a day. enjoyed splitting the cardio work today: not only does it feel more efficient (time wise), but it also served as a good warm up, and loosened my muscles up quite nicely after pump.

      i'm such a good girl gym wise, such a bad girl food wise.  monday, i went to the gym in the evening, and did a 60 minute pump class, followed by a 60 minute step class, both run by bettina. pump was good, even though it seemed rather "easy" somehow. guess i need to use more weight and concentrate on the muscles groups more.  step was fun. i usually hate step, but this was a good manageable choreography and a damn fine work out overall. pushed myself really hard and felt good directly after the class. however, by the time i got home and had finished talking to tina, who called as i walked in the door, i was absolutely exhausted, dehydrated, headachy, jittery and about to throw up. not good. forced myself to drink water and eat 4 rusks, because i couldn't manage anything else. went to be straight away, and was quite worried, falling asleep, that i'd throw up in my sleep. oy. thankfully, i woke up all rested and fine. need to be careful to eat and drink a little more before doing these hefty workouts.  today, i did three rounds of weight circuit, took part in a 45 minute step class and a 30 minute ab class, both run by sanne. doing the weight was good, even though i got all stressed out about being ready for the class on time (which worked out fine in the end). tried to concentrate on the muscles i was working again, which worked ok. could barely manageas many lower back exercises as planned - guess those muscles need some rest after yesterday's pump, even though i wasn't sore at all this morning. the 45 minute step class was quite taxing, mainly choreography wise, which involved plenty of turns and jumps and what have you. could have easily done 15 more minutes. the ab class was lovely & hard, just the right amount of difficulty. managed more full sit ups then everyone else. he.:)

      good day at the gym again.  worked out for 30 minutes on the crosstrainer (370 kcal burned) before joining a 60 minute bodystyling class by julia, which was as enjoyable as usual. again quite a focus on legs and bum, which was good. killer leg lift variations, which left my gluteus maxiums burning. ouch. got all angry again at my legs - the muscles in there are so big - why are they so blody weak during some exercises? hate being the struggling one in a class.  anyway. still enjoyable.  more tomorrow.

      was such a good girl at the gym today, indeed, despite a still lingering heaviness and soreness all over this body of mine.  just as planned, i did three rounds on the weight circuit. strantely enough, it went reasonably quickly, mainly, because i was alone there, besides some guy using the upper body machines while i was doing my first round. it stresses me if several people use the weight circuit at the same time, - makes me feel rushed (which makes my posture on the machines crappy) and self conscious and makes the whole ordeal last longer because of the constant re-adjusting of the machines. so today was quite undisturbed in that regard. nice.  the actual workout was good: used weights of a medium weight range (a little less than the last time i did the weight circuit, which was (oops) in june), concentrated on the muscle groups i was working on and took extra care in having good posture. got some tips regarding the latter from matt robert's book 90 day fitness plan. very fine, indeed. when the bum workout got to bad (and boy, did it get bad), i visualised myself on a beach. same for the shoulder press. i hate it with a passion, but kept thinking about how sexy slightly muscular firm shoulders & arms are in evan's opinion. kept imagining getting compliments for them while wearing singlets (which i usually get anyway, but still).  it helps, that visualisation thing. he.  after the three rounds on the weight circuit, i did a solid 60 minutes on the cross trainer, on a relatively high intensity. the last 10 minutes didn't seem to pass at all. gah. in the end, i burned off about 770 kcal, and those extra 70 kcal (2/3 of a timtam!) hurt. a lot. but what's the slogan again? work harder, burn longer. i hope that's true.  finished off with stretching, again undisturbed (the stretching corner is in the middle of the most testosteroen laden area of the gym -where the groaning men are- and completely mirrored. gah.)  overall, i am quite happy and content about the amount worked out today. and there will be more tomorrow. am so serious about looking good in summer.

      worked out a bit less today compared to the last two days - am still exceptionally sore, and -again- ran out of energy in the middle of the workout.  spend 30 minutes on the crosstrainer (350 kcal burned) before going to a 60 minute bodystyling class run by julia. the class was good, usual bodystyling exercises, with quite a focus on legs and bum again. my legs were killing me throughout, and i realised once we had reached the final ab sequences, that i was totally running on empty. duh. had planned on doing 30 more minutes on teh crosstrainer after the class, but knew i just wouldn't manage. will do more tomorrow: am planning on three rounds on the weight circuit, and 60 minutes crdio.  guess that half the giant's block protein bar this morning wasn't enough for breakfast. oy. again didn't feel like breakfast at all. need to resolve this issue somehow.  the breakfast issue aside, my eating has been okay,  apart from rather persisiting cravings for crunchy things (rusks and the like) in the evening. will try to substitute them with veges tonight.  may it work.

      i am so fucking sore today. feel almost every single muscle that i moved yesterday. my bum, legs and shoulders hurt the most. ouch. on the upside, my arms and shoulders have this nice - day after weight training look. yum.  i went to the gym despite the soreness. who cares about giving muscles a rest? i don't. especially not when I have to be on a beach next month. did a one hour class run by bettina, which consisted of 30 minutes step, interspersed with 5 minute intervalls of upper body (i.e. shoulders, biceps, triceps) exercises with reebok tubes. the last 30 minutes were spend with killer lower body exercises, squats & lunges (during which I felt yesterday's pump session), execises for the bum, calves, and thighs (both front and back). halleluja. it was just what i, or rather, my lower body, needed though. my legs and bum are my weak spots, and today's exercises were fab. really enjoy bettina's teaching style and was a tiny class, too, just 5 people total, all cosy and personal.  afterwards, i dragged myself over to the crosstrainer, where i somehow managed to spend another 60 minutes. geez. after 50 minutes, i was totally drained and out of it, but somehow managed to keep going. again, i felt all my reserves run empty. need to have more than the protein shake i had (which was good, because it was a wheat free meal, after all, and bad, because the milk made my stomach go weird for a while. bought low fat lactose free milk today, to see whether that will make a difference.)  had a good time at the gym today, quite communicative. the woman who i chatted with every day i was there over summer -about my trip to australia, and her house building, and her travels (need to ask for her name, next time), was quiet excited to see me again after all these months, and had fab news: she is pregnant, and -despite being at just 12 weeks- already has a noticeable belly and significantly larger breasts. i noticed the latter at first sight, walking into the locker room. odd - never realised i looked at other women's breasts that directly. oh well.  the weirdest thing though was, that she - in the middle of the step part of the class- said "oh, you've been to the gym while you were in australia, too, haven't you?" and went on to ask whether i has lost weight and to tell me i looked lots better. bizarre. because i don't think i weigh less or am fitter than the last time we met.  it turned even more bizarre, when -while i was on the crosstrainer- bettina came over, julia in tow, and gave me the exact same compliment, asking how much weight i have lost, and telling me it looked good. while i politely thanked her for the compliment, i told her i didn't have scales (which i don't), and wasn't aware of any losses. but happy nonetheless, if i looked good.  odd. very odd. especially because the new scales at the gym (on which i stepped yesterday) showed a lot more weight than the ones at my parents place, which i have been using while I was there (and which showed slightly more weight after australia, which was no surprise after all those timtams, and a little less since my swimming and working out with cindy).  anyway. odd. oh well. i won't worry about this and wonder whether they just remembered me fatter than i ever was, but try to take this as the nice compliment it was intended to be. who knows, maybe all my restricting and working out is finally paying off, who knows. :)

      ouch. pangs of guilt strike me, when i see how long i haven't updated here. oh well. i've been less active, but not completely inactive since then... while in melbourne, i was pretty lazy, due to work stress and lack of a gym. however, evan and i went running on the weekends - quite revolutionary for me, because i usually strongly dislike running. it turned out to be half as bad though, and i've even done some running here. wow. the things i do for love, he.  since i've returned, my activity level has risen: while at my parents, i went swimming almost every morning and swam between 1km and 1.5km a go, and also worked out with my old cindy crawford tape. better than nothing, me thinks.  now i am back in freiburg though, and the countdown to my take off to melbourne is running. just about 36 days, and i won't be able to hide behind thick jumpers. 36 days, and i'll have to be on the beach, in few clothes. ouch.  so. until then, it's the gym every day (ideally a class + an hour of fatburning), teamed up with supplements, sensible eating and l'oreal skinfirming potions. may it work. am also following matt roberts 90 day fitnessplan, which is a funky, well thought through book, and quite up to date in both it's work out and diet approach.  i am in stage one now, so besides the fitness goals, i will:    eat breakfast;  have at least 2l of water;  attempt to have 4 pieces of fruit and 3 servings of veges;  cut out red meat; and  ban processed wheat from at least one of my meals.    sounds do able.  to kick off, i went to a pump class by julia today. not having done pump in months, i chose weights at the lower end of the scale, which worked out well.  weights per side: warm up 3 1/2 kg legs (squats) 4 1/2 kg chest 2 back 3 1/2 triceps 2 biceps 2 shoulders 1 legs (lunges) 3 1/2  only picked too high a weight for lunges - geez, what a hard routine that was. could have used more weight for my shoulders. overall, it was an enjoyable class that made me feel good. am sure i will be sore tomorrow, but well... always happens. spend an hour on the crosstrainer afterwards, which was quite taxing and a wee bit boring, too. tried making it more bearable by visualising myself on a nsw beach. having had just a small fruit brekkie (not good, not within my plan), i clearly felt my energy run out. still burned off more thn 700 kcal. woohoo. gone are the 4 timtams i binged last night. or so i hope.  anyway. the gym has got a new timetable, i just had a good look through, and it seems like there are plenty of enjoyable classes for me every day. let's hope my motivation lasts.

      today, i did 35 minutes on the cross trainer (on quite a high intensity, 510 kcal, yeah) and then joined a body pump class with julia.  bizzarely enough, none of the wednesday morning regulars turned up, so julia and i did the class all alone, just the two of us, which was lovely, of course. - the alternative would have been to do my upper body weights today, which i didn't exactly feel like.julia profited from it though, too: we tried out the new choreography for the first time. it worked ok, butr not perfectly, and so far, i must admit that i much prefer the previous one we had, both music and exercise wise. - but maybe that's just because this was the first time. know for sure that i will have to up the weights on some of these rounds, soon. felt worked out, but maybe not enough so. oh well, i'll see soon enough.   weights per side  warm up: 3 1/2 kg squats: 7 kg chest: 4 1/2 kg back: 5 kg triceps: 3 1/2 kg biceps: 3 1/2 shoulders: 2 1/2 and 2 1/2 for side lifts lunges: 6kg  i wore my matte light grey pants today, which was interesting. it's the most unflattering colour and cut for a workout pant, but they do feel very good, and let me observe my legs better than my wide black pants. it's amazing, my legs are starting to look better. more muscles, less flab! yay! unfortunately though, i managed to team the unflattering pants with a t-shirt too short, so that i spend less time admiring my progress, and more time staring at my saddlebags.  on another note, my eating sucks, btw, am constantly grazing and nibbling and longing for food and eating left overs. eek. wonder what it means that my body wants to be fed so often at the moment. am also quite curious as to how much i will weigh on my parents scale on friday. theirs is the one scale that counts, and i haven't been on it in 5 weeks. eep.

      the past few days:   saturday : 90 minute yoga class. my muscles couldn't handle anything but that, i swear.  sunday : rest & hangover day. as it happens, after the consumption of a whole bottle of red.  monday : upper body weights, 45 minutes crosstrainer - i had wanted to do pump & step in the evening, as usual, but decided against it because tina came over for dinner. more important than working out.  tuesday : lower body weights, 45 minute step class (with andrea), 30 minute ab class  today was quite lovely. i enjoy my lower body weights so much, i can't tell. nothing quite like legs being all wobbly directly after, and all firm and nice a bit later. yay! step was enjoyable, even though i can't help but notice that andrea isn't that great at getting vibes from the folks in the course, realising what level people can work out at or at teaching at non-advanced level. oh well. i liked it, as usual. so odd when suddenly, after 30 minutes or so, the cardio rush sets in, and i get all excited and motivated and high.  there is no yoga tonight, so i'll be making an extra effort to practise alone here later.

      i've gotten very lazy this week with my note taking, with everything that i usually note - food, working out, my budget. argh. really need to force myself to keep writing everything down, especially with food and my budget. it's my usual habit of avoiding things that are difficult/embarassing rearing its ugly head again. like my spending habits. oh well. also need to remind myself that while it's good to shop for organic products at my local cool organic supermarket, it's still overeating when i'm eating organic food, too. syrup waffles are syrup waffles, organic or not.  anyway, my working out this week has been ok, despite a bout of  depression and the usual pms happening together earlier in the week.   monday : i was -as embarassing as it is- too depressed to work out. at the time i had wanted to leave for gym, i was curled up on my bed, crying. i felt too fragile to wear little clothing,  move  and be around people.   tuesday : morning: lower body weights, abs, 20 min cardio evening: 90 minute yoga class i had planned on doing a step class in the morning, after my weight training, but walked out after 10 minutes - i had a major headache from crying the night before and lack of sleep, that got significantly worse from the jumping. also loked shitty, felt shitty, and just didn't feel like completing the class at all, same as the day before: being around people, even the interaction in class was too much. yoga in the evening was awesome, though, because by then, things with evan had been sorted, and i was relaxed, flexible and happy. did several asanas for the first time, and felt wide, open, stretched, all over happy and elated afterwards.   wednesday : 60 minutes body pump, 40 minutes crosstrainer upped weights, which worked out very well.   weights per side  warm up: 3 1/2 kg squats: 7 kg chest: 4 1/2 kg back: 5 kg triceps: 3 1/2 kg and 5kg biceps: 3 1/2 shoulders: 2 1/2 and 2 1/2 for side lifts lunges: 6kg  felt very good before, during and after. all very lovely.   thursday : morning: upper body weigths, 60 minute fit plus class (20 minutes warm up, 40 minutes bodystyling) evening: 90 minute yoga class. the fit plus class was than last week, even though it was still nowhere near my level. - am still unsure whether i should keep going. yoga was lovely in the evening, too. loved the inversions today, but struggled a bit with the usually easy downward facing dog and had to work harder on the forward bends.   friday : lower body weights, 60 minute pump class, 30 minutes crosstrainer started my gym session intending on doing only my lower body weights plus some cardio. the lower body weights worked fine - i have found my rythm with the exercises, didn't feel stressed or hectic at all, and felt good feeling my muscles work. while i was doing my last but one exercise of the routine, julia was walking around the gym looking for people to join a class that was supposed to be bodystyling. however, 4 out of the 5 people that were there were body pump enthusiasts, so she decided to run that class instead. so i joined in. - there was no way i could have worked out nearby, hearing the body pump music... it felt quite silly getting the weights set up and all, considering i had already worked out my lower body and back quite intensively. alas, obviously not to the fullest: i had no problems whatsoever during the class, all exercises worked out well. it wasn't till the lunges that i felt the exhaustion in my legs. - and that was (and still is, actually) a lovely feeling that i have been longing for in ages.   weights per side  warm up: 3 1/2 kg squats: 7 kg chest: 4 1/2 kg back: 5 kg triceps: 3 1/2 kg and 5kg biceps: 3 1/2 shoulders: 2 1/2 and 2 1/2 for side lifts lunges: 5kg (which was a mistake. i had forgotten that i had done 6kg last time)  pretty much forced myself on the crosstrainer after pump, mainly because i've been way too lazy with the cardio again this week. at least something. i don't know what i'll do tomorrow: i think because i've done so much today, i might do only my 90 minute yoga class. i'll decide on how sore i will be tomorrow - i expect to be very sore (i already feel it creeping into my muscles, and i mean  all  my muscles!), but that's good. haven't had that for a while.

       today: upper body weights (2 or 3 sets, until muscle group "worked out"), abs, 60 minutes crosstrainer, stretching  forced myself to go the gym very very early today, to profit from an empty weight area & crosstrainer. worked well.  was happy with the weights routine. however, i got very stressed about the cardio work again: couldn't decide how long i should be on the stupid machine and kept changing my mind all the way through. finally forced myself to do an hour though, which was mind-numbing and terribly boring, because i couldn't even concentrate on the mags i was reading. maybe i should get books on tape. hm.  my nervousness, indecisiveness and jitteryness could be to blame on my not very high quality breakfast before the work out though, too. duh. easy to change that one, thankfully.  tomorrow: no crosstrainer for a change. will work out in the evening: a pump class with bettina and then a step class afterwards. yay.

      haven't managed to post every day, even though i worked out all week.   wednesday, 12th  - 35 minutes crosstrainer, 60 minutes pump  thursday, 13th  - workout b (upper body, 3 sets á 25), fit plus class (20 minutes step, upper body weights, abs), 90 minutes yoga  friday, 14th  - rest day  saturday, 15th  - workout a (lower body, 3 sets á 25), abs, 60 minutes crosstrainer  overall, i am happy about my work out habits this week  my new workouts have been going fine. - despite my expectations, i wasn't sore on wednesday at all. i don't think i've found the ideal weights to use for some exercises yet.  think i can up the weights on some of the leg exercises. in contrast, i need to use less weigth on the butterfly machine.  i upped some of the weights during pump on wednesday, too. got to remind myself to overall use more weights. - i think i am getting lazy in pump.  i am not content with the amount of cardio i did this week - i don't think i did quite so far. - discussed the amount of cardio that would be ideal with stephan, and he said i should aim for at least 3 hours, which i just barely did so far. it's just so boooring to spend that much time on the crosstrainer...oh well. need to find a way to spice it up. need to do a full hour tomorrow, too.  i am not sure whether i will continue going to fit plus class on thursday mornings. i like the social aspect of it, bettina is a great instructor, and i like the fact we do something different each week, but (and this is a major but), it's just not been challenging enough, and i've started to think it's a waste of time. in thursdays class, i didn't even break a sweat, even though i used pretty big weights for the weights part and did all the extra moves for step. so far, i've always managed to personalise my exercise in that class, but the week before, bettina told me it wasn't appropriate to use weights that class. - i don't know, why. maybe to not frighten the newbies. also, elke has been annoying me by commenting about my exercise schedule and workout intensity. we have different fitness goals, and she shouldn't be comparing us. it's that easy. i think i might keep joining fit plus for certain classes, i.e. when they do spinning, or step or pump, and only after doing my usual work out, i.e. the designated weight training for the day plus a little cardio.  i was very happy about my yoga practise this week, thurday's class went exceptionally well,  urlLink i did my first headstand  and managed to hold the crow for a short while.  i took my rest day on friday, mainly because it was v-day and i needed the morning for cozy phone time with evan. - also, i just didn't feel like working out in the afternoon or evening, i had a lazy day, and decided to enjoy it. worked ok - i had a lot more energy for my work out today. i also managed to relax during work out today. it's important that i improve the relaxation aspect and see working out as something that is a treat and good for me. - i really shouldn't stress while doing a certai exercise whether i will do two or three sets, while doing weights, i really shouldn't stress about whether i will get a crosstrainer and how long i will be working out on it. instead, i should go with the flow, decide by how i feel, concentrate on my muscles and enjoy.  sounds like a good lesson to work on this coming week.

      today: lower body weights (3 sets each), 45 minute step class, 30 min ab class, 90 minutes yoga the lower body thing was so hard that i doubt i can walk tomorrow. ouch.  i am unsure whether i should keep listing yoga as a work out. i am primarily looking for mental results, so.... don't know. got to think about it.  in other news, more comments from random people at the gym about my weight. i still don't know what or how to reply to "wow, you've lost quite some weight there, eh?". odd. i would simply never ever approach someone about weight loss. never ever, for fear of having a negative impact on their body image...

      i had a program discussion & show at the gym today.  stephan, one of the personal trainers at my gym, first off gave me lots of positive feedback and praise, which was lovely. he kept referring to me as very experienced and advanced. yay.  i complained to him that i had grown rather bored with my weights routine, and that i needed something new to rev up my working out and keep seeing the results i already have seen (you know, the two clothes sizes less and all). stephan suggested some fab things, and we together drafted a good new work out program for me.  we decided on an almost traditional split workout, to ensure that my muscles to get enough recovery between workouts. previously, i had been doing about 4-5 weight sessions a week, sometimes without even 24 hours recovery in between. silly, and such a waste of energy.  i have two different workouts now: workout a: legs & bum (5 exercises), back (3 exercises) and biceps (1 exercise) workout b: chest (2 exercises), shoulders (3 exercises), triceps (1 exercise), abs (variations of my favourite ab exercises, for all ab sections)  we decided that i will keep reps high, namely between 20 and 25 (i started out today doing 25), and that i will do 2 or 3 sets, depending on whether the muscle is worked to its fullest after 2 sets or not. also, i will not be taking breaks between sets, but work on the opposing muscle (where possible) in the meantime. it's quite cool, while most is still machine bound, the shoulder, biceps and some of the chest exercises are all with free weigths. yay. lots of testosterone floating around the mirrors there. he. as i was doing my set b today, doing shoulder raises, a guy next to me was working his triceps and moaning so loudly and consistenly, i think i know have an idea what he sounds like when he.. well.. comes. my life was better before i that, i think.  my workout schedule for the next 12 weeks will be this:   mondays:  workout b & cardio or body pump & cardio  tuesdays:  workout a & step class & ab class  wednesdays:  body pump & cardio  thursdays:  workout b & fitplus class or cardio  fridays:  workout a & cardio  saturdays:  workout b & cardio or rest day  sundays:  workout a & cardio or rest day  there will also be -hopefully- two yoga classes, one tuesday night with ralph, one thursday night with bettina. i think i will alternate saturdays and sundays as full on rest days. i admit that it is a hefty schedule, but i think that once i have gotten used to the new exercises and found the right way to organise my workout, i will work out less per session while seeing better results and being less bored.  weeh! am very excited.

      there's no kidding myself anymore: winter, cosy partnered living & eating, stress at uni, recurring health issues of the serious kind and a change in birth control pills have caused some not so good changes in my body. -  it's about time to get more structured about working out again, and this blog has helped with this in the past. how good that summer is back and the bike is usable, both makes the gym highly accesible.  the current goals: &middotgetting rid of 7kg of unneeded fat without freaking out about numbers on scales; &middot getting into a regular workout routine without freaking out because of time constraints; and above all &middot feeling stronger and even more energetic than i already do anyway. on the eating side of things, i've been transforming from ovo-lacto-vegetarian to vegan over the past few weeks, which has been a fab experience so far: i'm eating better than ever, i guess; the only downside being a strange craving for nuts lately, and while i know about their nutritional value, i know about their fat content, too.  no working out today though: i'm stuck at home with an evil sore throat and head cold. all attempts to make myself go to the gym this morning failed miserably, which -looking back- was probably the best thing to do: this cold has gotten worse and worse throughout the day, i can't even stand or walk properly.  grrrrrr.  hopefully, i'll feel better tomorrow, so that a gentle bike ride with andrea and some yoga are doable activity options.

      oh, i'm such a good girl.  i went to the gym today, despite my own attempts to sabotage that plan by telling myself all the reasons i could stay at home (work, menstruation, more work, sore muscles). when it was time to leave though, i convinced myself to put on my workout gear, dropped the waterbottle and towel into the backpack, and grabbed the bike, so before i could succeed at talking myself out of it, i was on my way. good on me.  too bad though, that my first pump class in months, a class i had anticipated so much sucked. and sucked totally. i don't like alina, the instructor, anyway, but today was especially bad. i don't think she is actually qualified to teach pump in the first place.  first off, she didn't seem happy that she was there. she didn't know the routines and made them up as she went (which you just can't with pump, which is supposed to be choreographed).  she didn't speak loud enough, she didn't correct bad posture, she was out of rhythm, forgot exercises, didn't stretch afterwards.. well, she sucked, really, her class sucked, and i wish i had spend my time in a more useful manner.  i had trouble holding my temper, actually. i felt the anger rise after the leg and back exercises, because i realised i simply wasn't getting the intense workout i had hoped for. i tried to modify, but that made me feel odd, too. so yeah: it was a hard workout, and i did get sweaty, but it just was not hard enough. not nearly hard enough.  overall, that was ok though, because i was totally underfed and on the ride back shivered and shook because of low blood sugar. bad me. good i didn't have time for additional cardio, i'd collapsed on the cross trainers, or on the ride home.  now i am fed though, and the soccer is on, and almost all is ok. only almost, because dirk crashed badly with the grassboard this afternoon and his right knee is about twice its normal size. so he's in need of some tender loving care, and tomorrow morning, i'll drag him to the doc. only almost, too, because my bike is broken and about to die, and i don't have any money for a new one. grrr.  but it worked out today, and that's good. and i'll work out tomorrow, and that's good, too. and on wednesday, we'll spend the day at a spa. yay.

      i finally managed to get my lazy bum to the gym again. hooray!  the gym hiatus was almost 5 weeks long. back then, i had a really good gym streak, several weeks of regular working out, but then came sickness, stress, heat, stress and more sickness. alas, all is well again. experience has shown that once i'm back in the habit, i stick to it.  i feel so much better again after two days of working out, it's quite miraculous.   friday  morning, i did my usual lower body weights training plus some 30 minutes of cross trainer. i would have preferred doing more, but due to time constraints (i had a shrink appointment that morning), i was in a bit of a rush. it was a good workout though. i enjoy the lower body set anyway, and it felt really good to feel those muscles working. all these weeks on non-working out had made me feel all wobbly (especially those large legs of mine), and the workout showed me quickly that there are muscles under there. hooray to that!   saturday  afternoon, i went to a bodystyling and bmw class run by andrea. as usual, her classes were a lot of fun, and highly taxing. no matter how much whining i do before going to the gym, or how much i try to talk myself out of going sometimes, once i am in front of the step in her class, it's all good, and i know i am there for a good reason. today, i am nicely sore all over, especially in the  legs and abs, as was to be expected. there wasn't any time for cardio saturday: the day was quite packed with other things and i'm happy i got time to do as much working out as i did. i thought about going to the gym today, but decided against it: i needed some relationship time. rushing off to the gym at 8:30 on a sunday kills that essential relationship. it was okay though, with all that soreness and such.  this week, i hope to get to the gym at least 4 times. on monday evening, i want to do some cardio and attend the first pump class in ages. pump is my fave workout of all times, and i miss it a lot. ever since my gym stopped offering pump in the mornings, i haven't been to a class, so i hope to change that tomorrow. tuesday morning, i should be doing my upper body weights, plus a step and abs class with andrea. wednesday, i hope to do lower body weights and spinning (wobbly legs galore!). thrusday/friday i should fit in some more cardio and weights. i'm going away on the weekend, to an ip seminar from uni, and don't know yet, whether i will leave on saturday or sunday. if it'll be sunday, i'll go to andreas bodystyling class saturday afternoon again. yeah: a week of workout fun is ahead! - it's all very much needed. my energy levels improve so much with working out, and i feel so much better about myself as well. considering that the ip seminar might very well include some swimming with fellow students, that's all needed, indeed..

      't was about bloody time. That's really all I can say for the moment. Fed up with the limited world of  urlLink Open Diary , I have ventured into new territory. Let's see where this will lead to, whether I ever get around to adding this to a RealWebsite or whether this will stay here and quietly develop into whatever this will be. Hm. Time to get to know this new TimeWastingDevice. Yay. More soonish.

      I keep staring at my toenails since last night, btw. They look so very lovely. I somehow like my feet so much better than usual when my toenails wear  urlLink this .   (A cheap version of the exact colour, I mean, of course. 30$ for nail polish? I wish I had that much extra.)

      A few days ago,  urlLink Shauny  linked to the  urlLink  review of the new cover version of "Lady Marmalade"  at  urlLink MightybigTV.com  and had this lovely excerpt of the recap:    Christina Aguilera is trying to hide her face from the camera, but her skank goes on. She's got some chunky nose piercing that looks like a piece of popcorn stuck to her face. Her lips are lined darker than her lipstick (a look that screams, "Blowjobs. Apply Here."). Her eyelashes are covered in glitter. Hot pink eye shadow. Some dark pubic hair-looking things are poking out from under the crimped bleached-blonde hair on her head. It's scary.    Ever since I read that, I wanted to see the video. Would it be as bad as I imagined it to be after reading that?  I should have never asked for it, really. Since last night, every time I turned into one of my two not so good music channels (namely MTV and VIVA), THAT video was one. And I swear, it is WORSE than you imagine it to be. A LOT WORSE. It deserves a top spot in that MTV show on bad videos. Urgh.

      Not feeling to great today, don't know. Came suddenly.  It's still way too warm over here, even though we had tons of thunderstorms since last night. I actually woke up at abround 4am because it was so light in my room from the massive lightning. Very impressive. I was half asleep though, can't remember when and how I got up to close my balcony door...very odd.  Spend the morning chatting to Linnie for a while (and to Dan, too), before I ventured into town to get a ticket for tomorrow's train ride and some dead animals for Michel and me to throw on the Barbecue tonight at Tina's party. It shall be fun. I haven't decided on clothing yet, but considering the fact it's very tropical at the moment, I'll prolly go with a black shell top and jeans. Oh well, not that important. I will, however, get very very smashed tonight in a very short time frame - I do, after all, have to get up really early tomorrow, my train leaves at 7:55am. Yeah. Considering I need to pack some leftover things in the morn, I should get up...early. Hm. Anyway. Looking forward to going home, another day with all that hair on my head and I shall freak.  Not much more to say right now. Thanks to the thunderstorms, the scaffolding workers that were very noisy in the morn took off, and the painter's aren't there either. Sweet loneliness.  More later. Gotta call my boy now. We have a phone date, sort of.

      So today was r-e-l-a-x-i-n-g.  Nothing else. I did nothing of great importance. Woke up early, thinking for a second or so that my exam was still ahead of me, chatted to Linnie and Kitto and answered AAS. Met Ev online and talked to him for a short while, too. Started cleaning my flat, was annoyed by the evil painter guys, got my lovely new cheapo CD and went to the gym with Tina. Didn't get around to study in the afternoon, but that was ok, too. Cleaned the rest of my place, considering this is a small flat, there was a lot to do, really. But now it's all clean, and lovely, and nice smelling. I already know it'll be nice to come back home on Monday.  And now this lovely relaxing day is already over. Watched the last episode of Buffy (season 4), which rocked. And am relieved, I won't have to suffer from withdrawal over the summer, we'll get re-runs. Yay! I missed out on so many Buffy episodes in the beginning, it'll be good to see them all (even though I read up on them lately anyway).  Oh well. I feel good. All relaxed. All tired. All content. *sigh*  yawn. bedtime. :)

      Over. It's OVER! I am freeeeeeeeeee!  (At least until tomorrow afternoon, when I need to get back on the work for my civil law paper.)  It went reasonably well. Those were 3 hours in hell, but I think I did an ok job. Not brilliant, but reasonable. It made sense, and civil law doesn't always make sense. Am still all hyped up and having a lovely glass of wine to calm down a little. Phew. I survived this, and there wasn't a panic attack either!  Tomorrow morning shall be spend law-less. Gotta clean this place (which is FILTHY at the mo)  and get some stuff into the basement (I think the SPG are getting annoyed with the stuff still on my balcony). Then some waiting for my package from amazon.com. Working out around lunchtime with Tina, then back to work on paper. Buffy Season (season 4) Finale in the evening. Yay.  The rest of the week shall be pleasurable and pass by quickly, too. Thursday, I shall work on the paper and work out. In the evening, Tina is holding her birthday bash to which I will be going with Michel. I will get completely smashed, I tell ya. Early Friday morning, I'll make my way home for the weekend. My dad actually invited me, the rents haven't seen me since Easter and apparently miss me. And I need a haircut and some clothes and someone to cook for me, so it shall be good, all in all.  Looking forward to going home. Oh, all is good now. How nice, how nice.

      Just like last week, now that I've worked every little muscle in my bod during BodyPump my brain tells me: sleep sleeeep sleeeeeeeep.......oh well. Had a good time at the gym, and yup, concentrating on my triceps for a while did make me a little more relaxed, even though I kept bitching to Tina. I hope she forgives me, it's really just because of the sucky exam tomorrow, and the paper. Went into Uni like half an hour ago, but still couldn't find out about the time and place for the exam. Duh. Gotta call in at 8am then. How annoying. Why don't they just post it on the net? Oh well.  Anyway. Will just write a little mail to Ev, have a look at some learning stuff and then go to bed. Odd, what a  quickly passing day today....and you wouldn't believe how warm it is at the mo: still 22°C at 10pm. Perfect weather to sit out on the balcony and have some wine. Too bad no one is here to share it with me. Very sucky. More tomorrow. Let's hope the exam won't be until 4pm (which is what I expect, really).

      eeeeeeeeeeeep! I will faint now. I just made a good catch. - And don't you dare to tell me otherwise, please!  I was randomly looking through amazon.com, getting a few things on my wishlist, when I stumbled over Radiohead's Kid A for 10 DM! Ten! (that's like 5$ US). Add to that postage & package, buying that CD totals at 15 DM, which is the cheapest, seriously. At Media Markt, the Kid is still about  30DM. So I ordered it and am all excited now. Weeh! The things CD shopping does to me. :) Happy. And even more excited now.

      Okay, Gym in an hour to get rid of that nervousness. It will feel good to turn my head off and concentrate on such odd things as my triceps (and managing the reps with the higher than usual weight on my barbell) and my shoulder muscles and my abs. Afterwards, i got to sprint into Uni to check when and where the exam will take place, evil me hasn't checked that yet, and the stuff isn't online either. Duh.  Or I should go and continue  urlLink writing about my first love  (through  urlLink Flytrappy  and  urlLink Shauny ), which I have done throughout the day during study breaks. Already 4 rocking pages long in Word, at 10pt Verdana. - And I am not even 3 weeks into the whole affair! No one will ever read the whole thing, I know it. :) I should offer it as a download. *lol*  Anyway. Off to get my mind off law for a while.

      The lines are getting blurry. The lines between Alaska, my online being, and "the real me" (Caro), to be exact.  I've realised that my desire to call myself "Alaska" and to seperate her from "me" isn't really there anymore. I've lived online as Alaska for the past 18 months, and somehow, it's just not that important anymore. She's not fundamentally different from Caro, but she still is someone else. Even if it's just a different  name. I think starting the blog had something to do with my change in opinion. At  urlLink OpenDiary , I had to be *someone*. I had to have a name. More work was involved in a way. More explaining, whatever. And now it's starting to feel odd to keep "her" up. I don't feel the need to hide behind "Alaska" anymore. It doesn't seem like "me" anymore. Sort of. The blog is more direct (not just because you can post tiny little tidbits). Posting at Scarleteen and talking so much with Kitto and Lin and Heather probably has something to do with it, too. Danny called me "Alaska" in one of his replies to a post of mine yesterday, and that somehow felt odd and I noticed it for the first time. Have I outgrown her?  Yes, behind Alaska is Caro; but there still is a difference. I read some of my old diary stuff, and that is Alaska, not "me". Geez, this sounds like I have a giant personality issue. Multiple Personality Disorder. *lol* Heather asked me what I'd like my site to be called at wantonhussy.com...and I really am not sure anymore whether I want it to be "/alaska". The folder is there (not that there is anything in there), but the more I think about it, the more I start to favour "/caro". Why pretend to be someone else online? This is getting pretty ridiculous, in a way. I could just as well be open about my online life and not seperate it from the real world so much. That doesn't mean I'll run around telling everyone, I just don't want to feel like I need to *change* and be different. My online life is all public yet still private in a way. Not many people know about my involvement with Scarleteen. Or my blogging or diary keeping. Ev knows about diary and blog and Scarleteen but never really reads it (I think). I don't know, really. He knows, but not which extend this has. Like how important the angels and Heather are to me. How much I enjoy the online stuff. How often I talk to everyone.  This medium was very very odd for our relationship, simply because I write stuff thinking "if he wanted to know about it, he could read up on it" and hence keep stuff to "myself" and my diary/blog that I should tell him straight out. Not very clever, I know. Tina knows about it all and Silke knows about my involvement with Scarleteen. The people at ProFa know about Scarleteen, obviously, and that I am a sexpert there. But that's it, really. And keeping it that way felt right. It doesn't really anymore.   Oh well.  I just feel that the lines are getting blurry. I don't want this compartmentalisation anymore, somehow. I think the fact I told J. about the blog today when he asked about my site (something I had already pondered a few weeks ago but dismissed as too "personal") is a sign of that, too. I guess. It did (and still does) make me nervous to know he knows about this. I don't think I am so overly important or interesting that everyone is dying to know what is going on inside my head, but giving someone who knows me pretty well and who I've shared quite a few things with (like a few years of knowing each other -5 1/2 years to be exact-, a big bunch of MSN conversations over borders and continents and two beds, too), the relatively uncensored me is still...difficult. How many people know how much I really wanted to drive a car into a concrete wall last year? Or that I am seeing Dr.K? Giving people who know me IRL is....odd. The deep dark secrets of Caro. And while I don't want to hide behind being Alaska anymore, being completely open and letting everyone run into my mind isn't exactly comforting either. It's dead frightening to be exact.  Somehow, I keep thinking that once someone sees the real me, they can't like me anymore anyway. I am only liked when I pretend to be whoever I am expected to be. In real life, until last year, I was always the bubbly, happy, smiling Caro. In fact, I still am, very often. It's easier. As Alaska, I could say that I was sad. Very sad. Depressed. Whatever. I still hid things as Alaska, but less so. I could talk about the meds that made me dizzy but that lowered my urge to jump off something. Ic oudl vent about Jen. About Ev. About everything. But now this just doesn't seem to do the trick anymore, saying this as Alaska. It's not Alaska, it's me. And me = Caro.  I just want to feel "complete". Both on- and offline.

        Highlight of the day :    Results of my  urlLink footie tipping  of the week: 6 out of 8. Which makes a total of 41. Which means for this round only I am #593 and competition wise on #2122. Better than in recent weeks. Not too shabs. But not too important, either.   Apart from that, I just cried yet again. Yeah. All time high for recent weeks, too. And most definitely today's "lowlight".

      So I am feeling not so great today. So very not great. I could scream or shout or whatever else. Or rather cry. That would be more likely.  I really don't know what's wrong. But that's not true. Well, I do. I am angry with myself because I didn't talk about what angered me and because I now feel foolish and like the evil, always bitching girlfriend. So I said nothing. Not how much it hurt that he seriously mentioned that he'd choose time in Thailand over time over here with me. Nothing. We had such a crappy talk on the phone, I can't describe it. I feel so completely and utterly disconnected from him. He says he misses me. But does he? I have no idea. I don't feel it. I told him I'd be happy to ease the financial load once he's here, but he refused that. Why the hell? I want him here. I want a chance for our relationship. I can't come and meet him. So why can't I at least help out a little? (we're not talking tons of money here, just everyday expenses). Isn't there an us? I keep thinking: he is trying to keep this "casual" even though we passed "casual" ages ago. I am the last person who wants to whine about lack of commitment, but right now, I just want to *feel* that somehow, in some odd little way, I am important for him, that our relationship is important for him, that I *matter*.  I feel so alone.  But I feel so shitty for "demanding" attention. Or love. Or whatever. Like the distrusting, evil girlfriend. The one who always wants more and who doesn't think about what he sacrifices. Who doesn't get enough. Or whatever.  I just want to feel held. Somehow. Cared for.  I am not asking for constant spoiling. Or whatever. I don't *really* doubt that he loves me. I just don't get why he doesn't show it if he loves me. Or why he doesn't tell me in such a way that I *get* it. Or why he doesn't somehow lets me know that this, that this "us",  is important for him.    "...love is blindness i don't want to see won't you wrap the night around me  take my heart love is blindness..."   ~U2~

      Just like last week, Tina called to cancel the gym plans for this morn. But it's okay really. I won't be going either, I just didn't want to cancel on her. Thing is, studying and calling are more important today, really....so, well...I should get going, eh?

      Up early on a Sunday morn....chatting to  urlLink Kitto  right now...I should get going soon, get a shower and pack my bags for the gym. And then call the boy, probably, so that he knows I'll call again later. Hm. Sun shining, already very very warm. Lovely. How sucky that I can't waste time online (like yesterday). How very cool that I get to use a bit on wantonhussy.com. Heather rocks, really. Love you, gal. Fuck that exam on Tuesday. Argh. I so don't want it, I can't tell you. But I should just get my act together, I guess. Need it. No whining helps here. Oy.  Anyway. So my day will be spend with gym, talking to boy, studying, watching "all you need is love" (a must for Sundays) and more studying. Oy. So unmotivated.  Oy. Time to start the day.

        Final results:     Essendon  18.14.122  Hawthorn  8.9.57    :) That means I already have 4 points out of 5 games already played this weekend. Good on me. My tipping has been so bad lately. Not that I am any serious about it.  Just returned from lying on the scaffolding and it looks like SPF20 didn't do the job. Off to apply something calming and cooling to my tits. And have lunch. Huuuungry. *roar* (that was my stomach)

      Listening to the Hawthorn vs  urlLink Essendon  game online while answering things in AAS. Very odd, I know Ev is there, watching it at Colonial Stadium, 16.409 km away from here, probably ecstatic because Essedon is playing well (even though it's prolly boring considering they are leading so strongly).  Would enjoy to be there, too.  Essendon leads 11.9.75 to 4.4.28. Which of course rocks.

      The flood of Porn only eMails into my mailbox continues.This really is the best eMail I've gotten in days:   "BRITNEY SPEARS CUMSHOT MOVIE!" We searched the net for the hidden Britney Spears porn movie, and we found it! It was made before she became a famous singer. At that time she was only sixteen, but still good looking as you can see  (and then follows a link to an .exe thingy)    Does anyone ever react to porn eMails? Oh well.

      Still no blogspot. Still no noteworthy eMails. Or calls for that matter. Am I getting angry and dissapointed? Yup. I should charge yesterday's session with Dr.K on him anyway. Am I really asking for too much here? Just that he thinks about *us* (not even *me*) for a minute before he makes these kind of statements? He doesn't seem to think for a second what some think sound & look like for me. But the problem is, he *does* think. Just not about me. Just like back in November. Which was a steady downward spiral.  Anyway. Lovely sunny day out there. Tina will be here soonish to go to the laundromat and sit in the sun for a while. Time to go.

      Blogspot is still down, and while I can't post (but not publish), I haven't felt the urge to say much over the past 24 hours. Not much has happened anyway, Gym, studying, the usual.  Oh, and of course following this  urlLink Kaycee thing . Geez. Am still impressed by the fact my first emotion was right.  urlLink Rowena  put it quite nicely:   "Real life is about holes in your socks and running out of toilet paper, not about piggy backs up a hill to watch the sunset. Well, my life anyway.  At least I know that I am a real person. And sometimes the internet can suck bigtime."   And even if you have piggy backs up a hill to watch the sunset, you don't have them in time to document the event as your famous last words a day before you "die".  I feel sorry for those who invested emotions into this made up thing (especially  urlLink Randall ). I wish the person who caused this gets sued by the gal whose photos were used to give "Kaycee" a face, gets treated poorly by the people in the small town that she lives in and one day gets some decent psychiatric care. Or hey, Debbie, you could open up a self-help group with Gary, the idiot who still claims to be  urlLink Lisa Jain Thompson !  Anyway.  Today is Ascension day, and for the first time in years, I am not at the camp of the student exchange organisation I used to work for. Somehow makes me sad. This year, I really couldn't have gone (for money and time reasons). Hm. So today was spend quietly. Slept in (until like 8), no SPG today, and that's lovely. Put on my bikini, drenched myself in SPF 16 and spend some time lying on the scaffolding over my balcony (even more in sight for crossing planes, I swear, Flytrappy, they are lower than 1km, seriously. Could it be because I'm maybe 2 kms away from the airport?), reading Alan Gurganus' "Plays well with others, which is extremely well written. Such a fab, sad book.  Even the opening thing alone, where Hartley goes to pick up the kiddie porn and dildoes from Robert's apartment (before his Iowa parents arrive to say goodbye to their dying son) is seriously one of the best scenes in a contemporary book that I have ever read.   Basket over arm, I finally opened the broom closet. One broom tilted there, leaned on by a dingy mop. I had expected oh three dildoes, tops. I found about thirty.   Thirty dildoes are a lot of dildoes.   They were piled knee-high, like cordwood. Propped, bald, ridged, and spired. Set on end, they formed a little onion-domed Kremlin. Some used adjacent cleaning products as their splints. Clumped there, the dildo quorum appeared unionized yet disgruntled. -Like toys caught in the act of trying to become the Toy-maker. Here were Toys that'd crawled up off the floor, yeah, into an erect position, okay-but bad not evolved much beyond.  Striving? yes. Brainy? - no.  They seemed to sniff up towards me, weak-eyed rats startled by daylight. Their pointed ends -the business ends- considered my new scent. The dildoes resembles some half-familiar form of household toll (actually, I guess, they were). But their reiterated shape fell somewhere between a vacuum cleanser's "wand" and the fuselage of an old-timey batter-beating Mixmaster. They seemed hybridized with that lank, shameless, duck-faced go-between, The Plumber's Friend.  I counted thirty-two, then quit. One was red and white and blue. Most showed that sickly pink shade combining chewed bubble gum with old eyeglasses' nose rests and ear hooks meant to simulate Caucasian skin tone. Others, browner, Latin or African, appeared tree-sized, ropey saplings. And all were lasciviously detailed: lariats of vein, cobra cowls that flared - fair warning. They gaped up at me like an open-mouthed choir of retarded children, looking heavenward. Some, I recognized, were actual casts from living porn stars; there was a Jeff Stryker, a monster, but somehow Roman in its genial fluted beauty. One such menaced proved double headed as he Russian imperial eagle.    (the Dildoes later free themselves out of a Tiffany's shopping bag on the subway later and *attack* people on their way to work)   Studied a little and watched the arrival of  urlLink Bayern München  in Munich. I hate them and couldn't care less about soccer, but seeing them win the Champions League late last night was still nice. I had actually already fallen asleep but woke up when I heard people outside screaming in excitement because of the shoot-out at the end. It is a well deserved win, after all.  Anyway.  Loveliest thing of the day was chatting with Heather on the phone for the first time. Has been ages since I moved to calling with someone I only know online (I think the last person was Lou, and that surely taught me a lesson *lol*) I knew her voice from Eyada.com, so that wasn't too new, but it still is a new dimension. And it was lovely. And very funny to hear Sofia in the background and all.  This whole involvement with Scarleteen does make me happy, even though I keep bitching about stupid posters all the time. I enjoy it immesely. Have met so many awesome people through it, if only we could all just hang out together? Quelle bummer.  In addition, if I were in the US, at least I already knew someone who could do some  urlLink Nawa Shibari  on/with me. Am so very curious about this, I can't tell you. I have to talk about this with Ev (from who I haven't heard since Tuesday, I think, hm). We have to talk about sex, hell, we should be HAVING  sex. Hm. At least I offered. I really don't want to loose this connection to him. Hm. Discontent with this. Considering that I have a majority of rocking "love my body" - days at the moment.  That's it for the mo, really. All's well. Apart from my motivation to do law. Nothing new, I know. :)  Off to see what's up at the boards.   (And I want to stop mixing up UBB code and HTML. Very sucky)

      Okay, I could say  urlLink "I told you so" . But I won't. I never told anyone anyway (did not want to sound evil and all, some people I know seemed sad & moved about that person's "death") and so no one would believe it if I claim it now. There is a little file sitting on my computer with a little essay titled "compassion, online" on hoaxes, Lisa Jain Thompson and made up cancer death stories and whatever else, that i wrote at the end of last week and wanted to put online a little later because I was quite obviously referring to the person whose "death" had just been announced. And now I read that indeed this person wasn't real. Was never real. Never died. And I don't even feel angry one bit - I never believed it anyway. Am just sorry for those who believed. But come on, people, it all fit too damn well. It was way too obvious. No reason to be overly sad and ponder the evilness of the world.  I think my lie-sensor is getting better.

        Something I learned today :    Applying a body mask made of dead sea mud is dirty business, no matter how hard you try, and no matter how little of your body you actually cover in mud.   Yes, this shouldn't be a surprise. I now smell a little salty and seaweedy, but my skin feels smooooooth. I think my thighs feel loved now.  "Now do a good job at the gym tmorrow, my two dears, will you?"  Lovely.  How sad no one can worship my smooth, soft, salty, seaweedy and sexy bod now.

      Tina backed out of going to the gym this morn, so I had to go alone...which wasn't half as much fun. Being there alone is just a litte...boring. And I just don't like the typical "gym crowd" very much, even though it's kinda okay on Sunday mornings.  Spent some time on the cross trainer and went to a "bodystyling" class by Julia, who is one of the nicest instructors at the gym I go to. Killed me, even though it is not a difficult class. Oh well. I have like no strength in my legs (but large muscles). Very sucky. Need more Pump classes, I guess.  Anyway.  Just had lunch, after a phone call with Ev (who wasn't in the best mood ever and tired and not looking forward to the stressful week that's coming up for him). Still good. But we really need to talk more I think. These past few weeks weren't the best we've had communication wise. We need more of that. I need to be better with eMails again. Hm. Maybe I will stop being so doubting again? Dunno. Tina still thinks I need to get that Jen stuff out of my head and discuss it with him (and so does Dr.K), but I really don't know...anyway.

      Oh, and yes, the horrible thing happened:  after they had started celebrating the win of the Championship in Schalke (they won against Unterhaching, and Hamburg had scored against Muich) the news came in from Munich that in the 93rd minute (yes, every usual soccer game has 90 minutes, this was overtime), Munich managed to score a goal and go 1:1 against Hamburg.

      Bono is god.  I just watched CNN's WorldBeat which had a special feature on U2, and geez, I thought I was over Bono. But I am not. It's ten years of being in lust with that man this year, and yes, he has lost some of his charisma, his blue eyes aren't as shiny as before, he has become the yucky rockstar he joked about 5 years ago, he has aged visibly and those violet glasses aren't exactly pretty, but there is something about this man that I can't resist. I confess it.  Think of me whatever you want. Call me boring, average, whatever, but U2 is still in the top 3 of my fave bands. It's not just loyality or nostalgia. It's not just clinging to the past. Hearing Bono sing....well, yes, something as used up and often repeated as "One" or something as kitschy and cliché as "Walk on"...it just does *something* to me.  I know. I know. I know. At least I am not proud of it. :)

       At the doctors office this morning :  Right after having been given a harmless diagnosis for the yucky stuff on my pharynx (in my mind, I had made up lots of worst case scenarios already) by the nice doc sitting in for my usual ENT, I ask him:   "So what do you think has caused this?"  "Well, there are several reasons: it could be a low immune reaction, or this or this or this  (sidenote: forgot it all already, I confess) , or it could have been caused by mechanical irritation."   To which I died laughing.  To which the nice doc blushed. And said something about dental procedures. But that really couldn't save the moment and omit the first thought I had.  Oh, how I wish it *could* have been caused by "mechanical irritation". *smirk*

       urlLink  ROCK ON!     "When I started listening to 'Christian rock' I slowly started to listen to just regular worldly rock (soft rock). Then I was listening to something harder and harder. It not only led me into worldly rock, but I was getting rebellious toward my parents, and I was having sensual and lustful thoughts. I also could not memorize or read God's Word and understand it or retain it.   A Fifteen-Year-Old Student From Nebraska   [...]  "I would like to share a little testimony concerning my experience with 'Christian rock' music. I had listened to this music with my friends and at church social functions for several years before I got my own tape, recorded by a famous artist.   "Buying that tape was the biggest mistake of my life. Under its influence, my moral convictions began to dissolve and I allowed myself to become involved in a relationship with a boy from my church, against my parents' wishes.  "When we were together we listened to 'Christian' and 'soft rock' music. It was all sensuous and destroyed my inhibitions. I am so ashamed of what happened.  "The music made me rebellious and pulled me away from my family. I thank God that I can say today that I have not listened to this harmful music for several months now and I feel a freedom I had not experienced before."   A Seventeen-Year-Old Student from Texas    (via  urlLink Ev )  Off to listen to some rock. I want more sensual and lustful thougths. All sensuous and destroying inhibitions? Sounds lovely.

      Just got back from 7 hours at PP. It was surprisingly good - I did most stuff alone and Irmgard liked the designs I did. And I got lots of praise. Yeah. Among people who know nothing, me and my limited layout knowledge, we rule the world.  When the poster was done, I helped Anne with some boring administrative work, but that was okay. She's pretty nice and we had a lovely chat. Annette joind us and she talked about techniques for counselling, and that was very interesting.  Best thing was talking more with Susan, who's the head of SexEd. She rocks. Nope, not just because she had some nice words on  urlLink ST , she showed me some cool things from her time working for PP in the US (back in the mid eighties) - including pics of picketing people in front of the clinic and her 1985 edition of "Our bodies, ourselves". Very cool.  Anyway. Now I am tired. And hungry.  And my fridge is empty. I should go and get some food.

      Do I care about soccer? Not really. The players aren't even half as yummy as the average  urlLink AFL  player (and I won't start talking about the especially yummy players - even though Scott Lucas has made the wrong decision in cutting off that nice shaggy hair. Just discovered that. Duh.).  But tomorrow, I will care about Soccer.  Please hope with me that  urlLink Schalke 04  will win tomorrow,  urlLink Munich  will lose against the HSV and Schalke would hence win the championship.  I so detest Bayern Munich. These snobs.  So for the next 48 hours, I will do as  urlLink Rudi Assauer  does:    urlLink "I'll believe in the football god."

        Sidenote:    May I add that today is a day when I wish I could rule the world and decide over everyone's  fate? The ultimate god-like position. It would come in so handy. I'd make a few people happy. Everyone seems to need some happiness these days.   (And on an egoistic & not really overly important footnote, I'd also make Jen fall in love with some nice guy and get over Ev.  And find a way so that  urlLink Flytrappy  could have all his international mates - including me- over for his birthday bash on the weekend. It would sure be fun. And being the ruler of the universe, I'd bring enough beer for all of us, too. He said something so nicely, the other, day:   "I'm not usually given to thoughts of Cosmic One-ness but last night as I laid me down to sleep something made me think of my online people all sleeping too, all around the world (nevermind that for certain of you it will have been broad daylight at the time)  in Germany, in Oz, in the U.S. of A. It was kind of cool."    I keep thinking about that sort of thing sometimes, too. About all these people all over the place that I care about - on the westcoast of the US; in the middle of it, in the south, in Canada, in Singapore, in Australia. Odd, how the world can be horribly large and very small at the same time.)

      I think I should just get back to bed and curl up again and sleep.     State of my health:        throat:  sore;   swallowing:  painful;   right ear:  giving me the familiar feeling of a nice ear infection.       Solution:     ENT:  tomorrow. 8am.   Urgh.  And could I please note that Irmgard from PP sure isn't someone I can/want to/long to get along with? (just as I thought after our first meeting last week) This is how you de-motivate volunteers - team them up with the bored, underworked intern who has no motivation herself and is shitty with PP because they can't employ her for real. Lovely. Oh, and shall I note that she will leave the project we're working on long before it happens. Lovely.  *sigh*  I still want a massage. And someone to cuddle up next to me. I want physical contact.  Goodness, this day really sucks.

      The flyers and posters for Planned Parenthood are finally done. They aren't terribly creative and even I don't have a fave (even though I do prefer the one with Lucida Console & Jazzposter as fonts a little), but I guess they will serve the purpose and reach the target group (men 35 and up). I will just let Irmgard do the choosing. So that she can do that, my stupid eMail needs send the huge file out first though. 3 tries already and it doesn't look like the current try will work either, very sucky. I might end up sending them seperately. Very un-professional.  Today isn't a day for being creative.

      I don't understand murder. At all.  I can't grasp it. Doing Criminology and lots of criminal law at Uni hasn't helped but instead left me even more puzzled about it.  How can someone dare to take another person's life? How do you decide that the way to solve your problems is ending someone elses's life? What does it feel like? What makes you do it? Can you actually grasp the dimension if what you do by killing someone? By robbing them of all they really have?  Jayce, who's an advo at Scarleteen from NZ, has lost one of her dearest friends. Her body was found on Monday, and her boyfriend has been charged with her murder. I can't tell you how this makes me feel.So very very sad for Jayce. For her friend. For all her friends and family.  How did her boyfriend (assuming it was him) decide she needed to be dead? How does someone do that? How CAN someone do that? How? How do you end a person's life? How can someone dare to play god?  And I don't even want to start thinking about the "why".

       Antoine de Saint-Exupéry   "The little prince"    "All men have the stars," he answered, "but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travellers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems. For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You-- you alone-- will have the stars as no one else has them--" "What are you trying to say?"  "In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night... you-- only you-- will have stars that can laugh!"  And he laughed again.  "And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh!' And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you..."

      I am not lying if I tell you that I did wake up early at this ungodly time because I was dying to find out whether this thing would be online again. Geez, this was more excitement last night then I wanted. The rating of my relationship with blogger as "even more abusive" (can't live with it/can't live without it) then my relationship with icq is taken back for the moment, even though I would love to see a week without probs (and I say that after 2 weeks here!). I still like the idea. And I know poor Ev is doing this all alone, so patience is good.  Anyway.  Off to chat to  urlLink Kitto  and make an early round on the boards. And sometime within the next three hours, I should mail the flyer to PP. Duh.

      Why does it take my stupid puter 2 full hours to defragment the harddrive?   Aargh.  The flyer is still not done, and I'm meeting Tina in an hour for the gym....geeeez, my days need a few more hours, I think. Maybe less sleep would help? Even though I keep thinking 6 hours is the minimum already. Oh well.

      Tina dropped by at 12, just as I came back from the ATM. We had a lovely time, really. Went to  urlLink Cheers  for lunch (had a massive amount of dead turkey & fries) and for a little shopping spree afterwards. Very lovely. Finally bought some decent work out shoes. It really was about time, the ones I used until today were dead even before I joined the gym (i.e. 3 years ago) and were so worn out that they were dangerous. And they looked crappy, too. So I bought a pair of Reebok Rejuvenator Trainer DMX. Yup, expensive. Very expensive, actually (and not money that I really have). - But the only pair of training shoes that would actually fit and feel good (and that had enough cushioning for my not so little weight). They aren't the most beautiful pair of shoes, really (they seriously look like boots and kinda odd with bare legs - have been walking around with my sweat shorts and the new shoes in my flat this afternoon) but they are comfy and fit well, and that's the most important thing). Can't wait to work out tomorrow. Would have gone today, but I still am way too sore from Pump yesterday...oh, the pain, the pain, the pain. :)  Tina went shoe shopping, too, and I found her some really pretty Paul Green shoes. Very pretty, I would have bought them, too. Even though town was packed and it was raining, we had a lovely time. It's fun to be in town with her, and we shopped successfully. Stared at the lovely see-through shirt by Kathleen Madden at Kaisers again. *sigh* Tis so lovely. *sigh* again.  Came home a little after 3pm, went online for a little while and met Heather, who let me have yet another sneak preview, this time at her upcoming article on adult/minor relationships. And she quotes me (extensively, on the relationship with Frank - wonder what he would say if I told hime), which is, of course, fab, too. It's excellent, and has a bunch of very good arguments. Very simple & very stromg. I shall link to it as soon as it is online.   Rushed off to see Dr.K then. Told him straight out that I was feeling "kinda ok" again and didn't really want to dissect the "kinda" again and end up feeling fragile and sad and crappy and lonely (like last week), mainly because I have the paper coming up tomorrow and all. So we had a relatively non-sad session, even though that doesn't mean it was any less "serious". So what did we talk about today? I told him about my blog and why I have been having some form of an online diary for almost 1 1/2  years now. I told him why some things from last week had made me so sad (I still find it very sad that I can't paint a future "dream" situation where I would be happy  - such as Heather's "farm in mexico"-thing). I told him about the stuff I wrote yesterday. On Jen. And then we dissected that (well not her, the issue).  I really would like to not care. I really would want to be able to hear her name and not freak. I really would want to not worry. But I can't. So we discussed that and ways how I can care less.  And that was hard enough.  Thing is, I am not angry at Jen. Do I have a reason to? Nope, I don't, really. I "won" after all. She never did anything to me. I am angry at Ev. Angry, because he doesn't treat her normally. Angry because it sends me "something is wrong here" vibes. Angry because he spends so much time thinking/worrying about her, and I have no idea whether he worries about me at all. And because being angry at Ev isn't good (in my head), I get angry with Jen.  And you know what I think: given the choice, people always decide against me. And the fact he has decided in my favour for the past 18 months doesn't mean anything in my head, simply because I know there were times when he really didn't want this relationship. I know, I suck tonight, but I just can't help it, really.  I want proof. No appearance on a white horse at my door, no ring, no big thing....just calls without TV/parents/family in the background. Caring. "I love you"s.  Too much?  Oh, and yes, some holding would be fine, too.

      What a pleasure to finally feel all those muscles I has forgotten about again.....I've been such a lazy bum lately....so the pain I feel now, after completing my first BodyPump class in ages is surely well deserved. It was LOVELY. It's so odd how well my body remembers all those movements, and the correct posture from hundreds of hours of working with the barbell (seriously!) back in 1998, when I went on my first "Alaska Improvement" Mission over the summer (while my then partner was away in Brasil) and came out skinny and muscular and pretty and fit (even though my first serious bout of depression quickly got rid of all that success again). Very odd, I really had a massive success that summer. I want that back.  Going to the Gym is weird though. It sure makes me feel good (afterwards), but it isn't terribly good for my self-esteem, it's not the communal showers (I really don't mind these at all) - I just don't like to watch myself in the mirror all the time. I hate full body mirrors. No matter how much I love myself most of the time, there is nothing in the world that helps me love these legs of mine that don't want to become the way I want to have them. Maybe liposcution and not eating for a few years would help, but those aren't options anyway. Even at my skinniest, my legs were still this way. We have a ten year love-hate relationship, my legs and me,  even though ten years ago (looking back on it) those were damn fine legs. Oh well.  I feel guilty at the Gym, too. Simply because I see all those people who were there when I started, and because I had this massive fall out last year (and these past few months, too) and lost the glorious shape I was in and basically have to start anew, which just sucks. *sigh*  I should really just keep going there, no matter what. No guilt, no mirror, no anything should kepe me away from there. I need working out, it lifts my mood, it's important for my health, it helps me feel good, it helps my legs to maybe at least change a little to what I want them to look like.  Anyway. I feel pleasantly sore. You know, this slightly warm, achy feeling in your muscles. Very nice. More sports tomorrow.  What else....still haven't started the stupid flyer yet. MUST do that now. Talked to  urlLink  Kitten  and  urlLink Linnie  this morning, which was fab. Missed Kitten so much, she just returned form her love & orgasm filled weekend with her boy. Am so very happy for her, I can't tell you. Linnie is bored to death at her work, which makes me a little sad. She would ahve so enjoyed the editorial spot, and now she's stuck with non-challenging data entry bullshit. 7 weeks to go, sweetie, you can do it.  Finally got a note re: the painters. I almost freaked yesterday, seriously. It will take 3 to 4 WEEKS until they are done.  4 WEEKS!  We are supposed to clean our balconies immediately, but I won't do that until they are basically standing on my balcony, asking me to do so. No topless sun bathing during the week. What annoys me more than the fact they will be painting the house (will be nicer without the fire damage/I will hopefully finally get rid of the horrible brown balcony colour) is the fact there will be scaffolding for that time. i.e. no open windows or doors when I am not home or at night (which is the only way to survive the warm weather round here. I always thought living on the 2nd floor was kinda safe, but with scaffolding and ladders leading right to your balcony...not really.  Off to start the flyer work. Tina will be here soonish (for a lunch break) and I should really get to the ATM beforehand to get some money. Duh. Later a session with Dr.K, and I am slightly scared I might have yet another break down today. More on that later. Just have this odd feeling.  blergh.

      For some odd reason, this little fact bit I read in Simon Garfield's  "Britain in the Time of AIDS"  really (yucky word alarm) "touches" me: During "The Party", a Safer Sex show at Wembley Arena back in April 1987,  urlLink Elton John  (who I really don't like very much, even though I admire the fact his  urlLink AIDS Foundation  has distributed over 20 million US$  between 1992 and 1999 to AIDS research & patient care worldwide) sang "Will you still love me tomorrow". And somehow this just says a lot about what it was like with AIDS in the 80's. And it somehow makes me sad. Very very sad.     will you still love me tomorrow?   ~the shirelles~  (1961)  tonight you're mine completely you give your love so sweetly tonight the light of love is in your eyes but will you love me tomorrow?  is this a lasting treasure or just a moment's pleasure? can i believe the magic of your sighs? will you still love me tomorrow?  tonight with words unspoken you say that i'm the only one but will my heart be broken when the night meets the morning sun?  i'd like to know that your love is love i can be sure of so tell me now, and i won't ask again will you still love me tomorrow? will you still love me tomorrow?

      oooh, blogger is finally back on (or so I hope). Geez, this was frustrating, very frustrating. I started playing a little with the template on Saturday afternoon, just at the exact same time things started going wrong at blogger, and for a while I couldn't identify whether it was me, the slight playing with the template, blogger or whatever else. Quite relieving to read I wasn't the only one who got the super annoying "error 210".  Anyway, I hope things are up and running again. I missed my blog.  Anyway.  Quite odd that the weekend is already over. It passed way too quickly, and I could very well do with another day of doing zilch (not that I will do loads today anyway). The new paper in civil law will be handed out tomorrow, and the honeymoon will be over then, definitely. Have a few things to do today.....should get the flyer for Planned Parenthood done until some time this afternoon (just so that it is out of the way), I really couldn't be bothered yesterday, just wasn't in the mood, the weather was too nice and I just didn't feel like doing any creative work (not that I feel ultra creative now).  It was a nice weekend, overall, if you substract that psychobitch bullshit. Spend Saturday enjoying my balcony and the sun. Silke came over Saturday night, we (or rather I) cooked, watched the finale of  urlLink BigBrother , where the third participant from the former GDR won (and not Wulf, who I had supported), alternating with the  urlLink Eurovision Song Contest  from Copenhagen, which wasn't half as good as in the last few years. Estonia won, with a song that was simply very very bad. But then all songs as the ESC are usually bad, so.... well, what did I expect? At least I am happy for Estonia. German participant  urlLink Michelle  came in on as #8 with her song  urlLink "wer liebe lebt" , and that was not too shabs, I guess (even though the song sucked just as much as all other songs and I guess most votes that she got came from people admiring her breast job). More than half the fun of watching the ESC is to bitch about the shabby songs from Malta/Lithuania/wherever else, there really weren't any good things there this year, so lots to bitch about. Silke was as "odd" as usual. I really have no idea why she is so difficult to have around. She never relaxes and is worse at wanting to keep an appearance up then me. And that really means something, I guess. Oh well. It still was kinda nice. She's just sooo complicated and too little fun to have around.  Sunday was lovely. Simply very very lovely, hot and sunny. I woke up at 8 (a lot later than all last week), and sort of straight away went out to the balcony. Drenched myself in SPF 20, put on my bikini, and sat in the sun and read. Quite lovely. Figured out that I can lie topless on my balcony, if I make a point of lying nicely cushioned on the floor (and not in my balcony chairs) and just enjoyed feeling the sun on my body. :) yay. Started to wonder, after a while though, whether you can still look into my blacony from up above, there simply are tons of little planes flying flying pretty low right over here (and onto the little Uni airport). hm. Flytrappy, your opinion?  Being completely protected from view or not, it felt lovely. Sun on skin is great. Felt all warm and nice and great.  Sitting in the sun, I called Ev, who told me more about calling Psychobitch and the party on Saturday. I made a point out of not asking about it, I really simply didn't want to ask because I knew I would get all angry. They talked twice, apparently, and she called him and they talked for 1 1/2 hours. How very sucky. I just hate her. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her. I hate her. Urgh. I don't want her in his life. Not at all. I am in no position to tell him what to do, and I feel really bad for wanting to do just that. Ev thinks talking to her was necessary so that she wouldn't make a scene at the party, but I keep thinking she wouldn't have dared to do that anyway. Everyone thinks she's being completely ridiculous these days. Fuck, they split up 1 1/2 years ago, she should really grow up, get a life and get lost, and stop acting all hurt and betrayed and what the hell. The whole bullshit she pulled back when I was in Oz lasty ear and even more so when Ev came over this year was so completely and utterly ridiculous that no one takes her serious in regards to Ev these days. Fuck, she is the EX, she has no fucking point anymore. She hasn't had a point in 18 months. She should simply get lost. And never ever show up again.  I don't get why Ev still thinks he has to look after her and worry about her. Really. He has no duties towards her, he should simply greet her and pass her by and not try to avoid her, and it would all be well. As much as I liked his recent avoiding of her, it really is ridiculous  on closer preception. Does he have a reason to limit his life because she hasn't gotten the point yet? I really don't think so. Argh. I hate her so much. Fuck off, Jen, just fuck off and leave us alone.  Ev said psychobitch thinks his health problems were caused by all the stress (with our relationship, because of her stupid ultimatums, I might add) he had last year. Quelle surprise. I said that all last year, too, but apparently, this wasn't registered. Who caused the stress and the guilt and whatnot back then? Yup, Psychobitch. Congratulations, girl. And be proud, you also played a not too little part in my depression. I shall repeat it again, I guess: FUCK OFF. Just FUCK OFF and leave us alone. It was all well while you were away, while you didn't call, while you were off the scene - and I won't fucking let you change that. You don't deserve all the thoughts I wasted on you. You don't deserve all the worries Ev had about you. He always worried way too much about you, you made him feel guilty for something quite sad yet very normal (falling out of love with someone and in love with someone else again) and as shabby as you treated him and me and as fuckingly stupid the things were that you demanded - you never deserved one ounce of all the attention we gave you.    FUCK OFF, Jen. JUST FUCK OFF.  You'd make two people very happy, instantly.  Aaaargh.  I hate her. I hate her in his life. I hate her calling him. I just hate her. And even though he assured me this was all necessary so that he can worry about her less, I keep expecting this to be the start of it all again. I just can't and don't want to go through the trouble we had with her last year ever again. Never ever. I have enough problems with my self-esteem and self-value and feeling loved without her messing around in his life. I seriously could not handle it again. I just couldn't.  Yup, I got slightly agitated while on the phone. Ev tried his best, but to me, she's what the red cloth is for the torro. I hate her. I go blind with anger whe she appaeares on the scene. Last year, I pretended for such a long time that I was okay with her being around, even though I wasn't. I won't ever do that again;that almost brought this relationship to an end. I will never ever happen let that again. *sigh*  On a nicer less-psychobitch related note, I miss him. I want him here. I want safety and feeling loved and not worrying about her. I know she can't "steal" or "take him away" from me. If I thought she could, it would mean that I'd regard Ev as a willingless "thing", which he simply isn't. I should be able to rest and be calm and not get angry at her being around and trust in Ev and our relationship, but I can't, and that makes me feel foolish and childish and dumb. I want peace of mind. But where can you get that? Can you buy it in cans?  In any way, yesterday was still nice, even though the phone call was far from nice/long enough/raunchy/really re-assuring. I just don't want to feel disconnected from him, and that's jsut waht always started when he and psychobitch started communicating about their "relationship" again.  Uhm, the rest of the day, yes: Spent a big chunk of the afternoon (when the sun had dissapeared from my balcony and I had maxed out my SPF) in front of the puter, chatting with lovely Mary and equally lovely Beppie (who I will probably end up meeting this winter), which was very nice. Had a very late lunch/early dinner. Watched the first episode of the summer season of  urlLink all you need is love . They still aren't using  urlLink us  in any TV spots though :), quite sad *lol*. They do have an ad though with the LDR couple that came a week later... Seeing Kai, the mod, and hearing the music and seeing the studio was a little much, really. Could have cried throughout the show, really, simply because I wanted to be there again, because of "been there, done that", because it was kitschy and romantic and because it was so cool that they got Ev for me and we had the best time of our life and saved our relationship. Should really eMail Jenny, who was responsible for our entire thing, again. *sigh*  Well, what else? Of course I talked to my mom, who only got her mothers day pack today, because my dad hadn't picked it up at the post office  on Saturday. Spend the rest of the day doing this and that, fiddling with online stuff, jamming together a few photos for a  urlLink stupid little gallery  site at msn, talking to Heather, who let me have a sneak preview at the upcoming gallery with photos by  urlLink Geoff Cordner  (who rocks, very much so) for the upcoming body image issue at  urlLink SL  and doing this and that. Checked my  urlLink footie tipping , too, and even though I had glorious 6 (SIX!!!) points this round (out of 8) and was only 1 point away from the actual goal difference in the tie breaker game, I fell on the competition ladder from #2370 to #2692!  I was #1923 in this round...how come I got worse competition wide? Sucky. Oh well. I won't win the trip with the team anyway now, *lol*.  Logged off at 11 or so and went straight to bed. I really don't know, I was very tired from not doing much but lying in the sun. Cancelling the gym plans with Tina (who was very hang-overed all day) yesterday was the best decision ever, it was way to warm. Will be better to go sometime today for a BodyPump lesson.  Dreamt odd stuff about computers (with strong sexual undertones) last night and woke up freezing in the middle of the night. Still too cold to sleep in the nude and with thin sheets these days.  So right now, the sky is overcast. It's a freezing 17°C. There is a post left in AAS that I don't get for slang reasons. I am annoyed by the sucking up behaviour of a poster at ST (sucking up should be a reason for instant removal frm the boards). I need to get started on the flyer for Planned Parenthood. I want my archives fixed. I want lunch soon, but have very little adequate food here. Hm.  Anyway. Time to get creative. More soonish.   Let's just hope blogger stays alive & responsive. If I now get an error 210, I'll throw a fit.    Footnote:  And in case anyone knows how to fix the blogger archives...could you jump in and  urlLink help ? I have no idea what is wrong and why I don't get them. Looked it up in the help section, acted accordingly, there are no settings I can change now, and the HTML should be correct, too. I bet it really is just a tiny little thing not worth being posted in the help area, so if anyone knows how to help, please do so.

      I am childish. And controlling. And distrusting. And fucking scared.  Ev called Psychobitch today and went to that party where she was, too, and the mere fact that he has called her could make me walk up the walls..but that isn't true. It makes me sad. And insecure. I'd rather hide somewhere instead of walking up walls. I don't know. I am just so scared that the whole bullshit will start again. That this one stupid call (which I think he shouldn't have made in the first place) has sparked some new hope in Psychobitch's head and that she will start wanting to see him again.  I should trust him in making the right decision, but I just can't. I really can't; I simply never got the motivations behind all the bullshit of last year, the avoiding certain parts of Melbourne because of her, my not-meeting his friends because of her, and what the hell. I don't want her around him. I just don't. I can't stand the thought of her around him, even though I know it would me even more childish then I already am to ask him not to see her anymore. I have no right to control his life, after all. And I really don't  *want* to control his life. I want to trust him, but it really doesn't work in respect to her.  The last few months were so calm. Not just because she wasn't there, she's not *that* important, after all, but simply because things were...stable. Okay. Clear. Defined.  The fact that he called her just shows that things between them aren't normal yet, if they were, he would have just gone to the party and have given a shit. Really. If she wanted to pull a scene, it would have been her fault, why worry then? All his friends finally think she's overreacting very much in regards to Ev. So why does he even care? I don't get it.  The same old fuck has started again.  Hooray.  One completely fine day for me would have been too much, I assume.

      Lovely weather, hot, sunny, bright blue skies.  Went to the market and bought healthy food. Wore shorts and let my poor white legs see some sun (protected by SPF 20 though). Planted plants on my balcony. Did my ironing on my balcony (singing along to Dave Matthes, the Red Hot Chilli Peppers & Alex Lloyd), wearing a bikini top and shorts. What a bummer the painter guys aren't there today.  I feel great today. :)

      The sun is shining into my room, and it looks like this will be a lovely day. Have been awake for ages, chatting to  urlLink Kitto  who's on her way to her boy in a few hours, reading blogs and checking the boards, and I am in a lovely mood.  My boy just came online, and he's telling me about the first baby he helped deliver. Nice to see him. I missed him this week. A lot, actually. *sigh* But it's okay, he's a busy boy. And a lucky boy, too, not only delivering babies and seeing lots of happy non-sick people at the hospital, but also going to see the Dandy Warhols tonight.  I wish I could go with him. That would be such a normal-regular-relationship thing. *sigh* I want boredom and normality in my relationship, too.  Anyway. No time to whine. I should rather keep talking to my boy and get ready soon and go and sit in the sun on my balcony and catch some tan and mood lifting energy.  This day shouldn't be too shabs, I think.

      Better. Feeling a lot better.  I don't know, yesterday just sucked very much, and I really didn't feel like documenting it. The only highlight (apart from the awesome idea Flytrappy had in regards to cheering up, haven't put it into action though) was Tina coming by and being nice to me. Silke came over yesterday evening, and we had a light dinner and played "Who wants to be a millionaire?" on the puter (and I managed to get to a million and winning, too).  Today started very sucky. I had big time cramps, was moody (I am convinced now my mood changes aer influenced by moon and cycle) and whatnot and felt like staying in bed all day, but Tina came over, dragged me to the Gym and that made all the difference, really. I basically spend the morning in bed. The 45 minutes on the cross trainer weren't exactly nice, not just because I have like no cardio stamina at all anymore (very dumb, I should know better and look after my health better, after all I am at a major risk for heart disease and diabetes), but also because the lovely warm weather gave me a killer headache. Tina and I did a bunch of crunches to finish off, and afterwards, once we were in the shower, I felt heavenly. I need to work out more. Really. Not only good for my bum, but also for my mind, I guess.  Afterwards, Tina and I went grocery shopping, before she headed to Uni and I headed back home, where I first of all had a lovely nap. Yay. That made the day even better. In addition, Mom sent me a cool pack today - two books (one O'Reilly one on HTML - short & sweet -now I want  "Web-Design in a Nutshell" , and one on law and studying that I had asked for) and some yummy gummybears. Very lovely. I felt loved. Very nice. Left the puter off for a big chunck of the day, and that was prolly good, too.  Well, so today is better than yesterday. Wasn't that difficult to begin with, but still.  No news from my boy, but that's ok. I bet he's very busy at the hopsital, am dying to know how seeing babies being born was for him. Miss him. Am a little worried as to whether he has indeed called Psychobitch, and am....uhm...cautious....as to what I think about the fact that he will meet her at that party tomorrow. I just  hate  dislike her so much, I can't tell you. She sucks. So much. I firmly believe that psychobitch would do anything. I believe one call by Ev could give her a start into being dramaqueen again and making trouble, even though he assures me she is no thread. I really really try to trust him. But when I told him that on Sunday, he just said that I tried that last year and that that didn't help much. Fuck, this is just my controlling self talking here. Excuse it, please.  Don't have much more to say. Am better. And that's good.   And Flytrappy, yup, I'd bring dessert. What kind of dessert would you want?

      Am tired.....tired...tired...tired......from doing not much. Very odd.  Spent two hours at Planned Parenthood this afternoon discussing my work schedule and what I should start with and having a first look at the stuff for the website. Having people who don't use the net design a website is complete and utter bullshit. The basic idea isn't too bad, and as I said, the material and data is all there, it just the main concept that simply isn't exactly online-compatible or whatever. Hm. Anyway, this should still be fun. Showed off ST, and as a contrast to the poorly organised german PP website, it looked even more stunning than it looks anyway. Met Irmgard, who I will be working with in regards to the autumn celebrations. First impression: hm. Don't know whether we will be on the same wavelenght. I will only do some layout and flyers and posters, so I guess I will be able to keep  contact to a miniumum if necessary. Will be working Friday mornings from now on, prolly from 10am to 3pm or so, and that suits me very well. Well, no matter what, I bet it will be interesting, and the social contact will be good, just as the skills I'll be learning. Anyway.  Don't have much to tell really, I'm all headachy and tired yet still a little lustful. Finally read Hanne's latest story ("Visiting Julia") at  urlLink SL , very nice. Watched a beautiful, kitschy TV movie tonight,  urlLink "Sophie - Sissi's little sister" , on the life and love of the sister of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria. Very kitschy. It did, however - I swear- have the the hottest, raunchiest sex scenes I have ever seen on normal TV before midnight. The director had a slight fascination with the well proportioned ass of the male lead. Yay! Not too shabs, really. His face lacked a few things, and Tina and I both felt that something was odd about his ears  (and his accent) but he was  urlLink still good enough to look at . But that very pretty ass sure helped. That's how I like wanna-be-history TV movies. Plus I really think I need a corset now. Hm.  So what else...     Checked my  urlLink Essendon Footie tipping  for the week, and while I only had 5 points this round, I climbed up the competition ladder and am now on #2370, yay. 25 out of 40 points is still pretty embarrassing, but hey, I can't even watch the games and have to depend on the net completely.   I think  urlLink Internet time  doesn't get enough attention. I like the idea. And the fact that Biel, Switzerland, is the meridian for @time, is just cute, even though it shows that the Swiss sometimes have a little attitute prob.    Enough random things...guess I should simply head to bed now, I bet the nasty painters will start working and looking into my flat way too early. Urgh.

      After a hectic morning and noon at ProFa, I made a lovely little trip to Ikea, and am now the proud owner of plastis, solljus, sälöm, ängsö, solljus and something whose name escapes me at the moment.  Oh, how I love Ikea. The colours. The illusion that life can be colourful and tidy. The illusion of being unique. The cute little model flats that have swedish books on the shelves. *sigh* I grew up with Ikea and have loved it ever since. Even though my rents never let me play in the colourful playland that had that ball pool, going to Ikea was always an event. At the least, I would nick a few of these blue and yellow pencils that you get so that you can jot down where you find the product of your choice in the warehouse. I always hoped I'd get that green snake that is still in their program. I never did. But it was still fun, every time, looking at things I thought were dead cool. I remember buying my first sofa there, back when Fabian moved out of his big room and into the basement. A lovely sofa, that is still in my old room. I bought it because my friend Jane had it; I slept on it for the time our exchange student Mary was there, I had tons of sex on it (that thing saw a fair share of occupants, actually), I still love it to shreds.  Most of my furniture here at my flat and actually an incredible amount of stuff that I own is from there and had cute little swedish names when I first met the. My desk (self assembled), my lamp, the magnet noteboard, my shelves, my closet, my chest of drawers, my sheets, my carpet, my table, my extra chairs, my glasses, my cuttlery, my plates. Almost everything, indeed. My bed isn't from there, though, the only bigger piece of furniture bought somewhere else, even though it fits perfectly into the Ikea scheme.  So I went to Ikea today. I made my way through there this afternoon, the place was as empty as I've never seen it before, and everyone seemed relaxed and happy being surrounded by Ivar, Billy and Biallit. Apart from me, most customers where young couples with young kids trying out sofas and being happy, pregnant women with non-pregnant friends shopping for baby furniture, french women buying plants, young couples, with compulsory bod mod shopping for closets.  So I walked through there, at first avoiding to use a yellow bag, because once I have that yellow bag over my shoulder, everything I want goes in there. I stared longingly at yellow and orange rubber CD holders that would look so much better than the boring black ones I have now (Ikea would be replaced by better, newer, more colourful Ikea). I stared longingly at some sheets. I stared longingly at some kitchen stuff. Once I had made my way through the exhibition part, I had to get a bag though. First thing that went in there was "plastis" a pair of 1.90DM plastic gloves in red and orange with cute little decoration. I resisted a yellow plastis washing up brush that looked like a snake. Next one to join plastis in the yellow bag were two solljus sets, both made of adorable plastic in yellow, red, pink and orange, adorable 1950's weave. *sigh* Both just 3DM each. I fought with myself to not purchase any replacements for my Rondo plates, just not that important at the moment. Stared at the vase whose name I have forgotten. Put it up, put it down, put it up, put it down. went off. Looked at things that didn't tempt me at all (lamps). Stared at some cute computer accessories. Resisted. Stared at picture frames. (and resisted). And then came to the outdoor/gardening section, which was the real reason why I came. Looked at sunshades...and while the one I had wanted was only there in an icky shade of baby blue, I chose sälöm, which sure has an odd colour combo (very 50ish blue, yellow, green, orange with white - look okay on my balcony though). And it was the cheapest, too - 19DM. Who's to complain there? And then I saw the solljus kite bag. Fabian has it. It's orange and yellow and red and pink (do you seen a pattern here?) and 1,20m long and lovely. And I looked at it. And looked at it. And decided that I wanted it. And that 10Dm sure was okay for something that serves no purpose other than being decorative. Now that I had sälöm, I needed something to hold sälöm in place. On the scene for ängsö. Made of plastic and concrete, weighing about 20kg, 25DM. I thought, hey, I can get that home somehow.  Standing at the checkout, I saw the 3DM vase I had resisted earlier again and decided that I needed it after all. - What if Evan's birthday flowers did in fact arrive after all?  *sigh*  The pleasure of buying at Ikea. You know if you've resisted once on your way through the store, doesn't mean it's over yet. They have whatever you want right at the checkout again, those clever swedes.  I did make my way home somehow, too, ängsö in a hastily bought blue Ikea bag. Arrived all high on purchases and lack of food. Assembled my sunshade. Put up my solljum kite bag that is swinging in the breeze happily. Washed the 3DM vase without a name. And feel damn good. Can't wait to get up tomorrow, open my sunshade and sit in the shade and feel good. About buying cheapo things that make me feel at home at my home and that bring colour into my everyday life.  Oh, Ikea makes me happy. Very very happy.  *sigh*

In addition, after the little bit of rain this morning, the heat has returned and I am totally groggy. *sigh*  Anyway, should eat something and scan the piccies I got from the photo shop today -  me, on the scaffolding, only partly clothed. Ev should like them, they turned out surprisingly nice, while some others were so freakishly ugly that I had to destroy them straight away.

I look like I either have an abusive partner or am into some serious SM that leaves marks.  Anyway.  Waiting for my shower water to warm up, then off to the puter shop to look for cams, then on to coding. Sounds exciting, eh? Hmph, not really. But the sun is shining quite lovely, I should go and take my Web design book outside and sit in the sun and enjoy. Oh, sweet life, sweet life.

      Yes. It was a lovely day and a lovely night.  All started out with Tina picking me up at 4pm, telling me to get shoes and follow her. She basically kidnapped me, *lol*. Michel was waiting for us at the Uni parking lot. And that was my birthday pressie: they kidnapped me and took me to out for a picknick. Glorious, really. Such an excellent idea. We drove out into the mountains, and found a glorious spot up near some place called St.Ulrich (Geiersnest, to be specific), and relatively recently mowed field. Great view of the  urlLink Schauinsland , where Paragliders where having fun. It was lovely, really. The sky was unbelievably blue, the sun was hot, and we had this great place with a great view. Michel had baked a strawberry cake, and we three had it all. Had a bottle of champagne, too, and music, and lounged around, having a lovely time, really (even though I think Tina and I bored Michel to death with our usual girlish talk). It really was divine. Out there, I mean. *sigh* so very lovely.  Stayed out there far longer than planned, and when we were back in town (sort of around 8ish), I changed quickly, put on some make-up and headed of to Britta. We quickly cycled to Michel, who was already waiting for us. So out to the party we cycled - took about 40 minutes or so, in the going down sun. The sky an unbelievable colour of blue. It was so lovely, really, even though a pretty evil ride. Nice though, through the fields and the vineyards. Absolutely divine.  The party was divine. We partied from dusk till dawn, really. Simply the location rocked - a really large, open hut at the edge of the forest, right behind the vineyard. Lots of tables and benches in front, a large bar and dancefloor inside. Excellent 89's and 90's music which reminded me of being 15 and happy. The sky was getting darker and darker, and the moon was all small and it was just divine.  Michel, Britta and I started the night out with some beers and some champagne, sat down and quickly started to chat with some girl whose name I have already forgotten. Fritz came and brought another bottle of champagne, too; Michel went off to chat up some girls who he spend most of the party with (which was great, I was very happy to see him there having fun), and the sister of the girl who sat with us turned up, together with a guy who I thought was her boyfriend, a really interesting guy called Johannes. Talked about tons of things, Australia ans New Zealand, and this and that I got to tell the "all you need is love" story again, too,when one of Fritz's friends came over and told me she had seen Ev and me on TV back In January. *sigh*  After the Champagne bottle and some more drinks (and the first woodruff flavoured wobbly vodka jelly of the evening), the two girls, and Johannes and Britta and I moved over to the dance floor, even though the music was relatively crappy at that moment and we started to convince the icky DJ guy to put on better music, which he did after a while, and we danced. And had more drinks. And more jelly things, And just enjoyed ourselves. Cool music then, New Model Army, Nena and INXS and other good old 80's stuff and we screamed along and it was good ( "....mystify....mystify me....." ). At some point, the two girls left, while Johannes stayed, which was kinda odd, because I thought he was the boyfriend after all. But anyway. He started to flirt rather wildly, which sure was funky and good. After all, flirting is okay (and the ground rule is:  "flirting ends where kissing begins" ) and fun. So we danced and screamed and had more drinks and it was all good. Johannes and I talked about music, too, and he apparently liked what I like and found my confession that I liked The Sisters of Mercy back in my youth adorable and was practically willing to kiss the ground that I walk on. *rofl* That sure was good for my ego.  Still didn't think anything of it all. Was just having a lovely time. And after all, he knew that I am taken (or at least I thought so) and he had a girlfriend, too (or so I thought). Well, it got to  point when I realised I had to pull up my barricades again (when someone makes it quite obvious that kissing should be next and you don't want to, you should say so, I think), and so I did that. Ick. I hated it. He obviously had not heard the story of "all you need is love" as I was telling it earltier and hence didn't know I had someone. And apparently, the girl wasn't his girfriend either. Oy. And he is a cutie after all. A cutie I liked but not one I wanted. Seriously. Not for one moment did I think that anything should happen with me and him. Not for a sec. The hunting was fun. The kill wouldn't have been. I want Ev. I want to be monogamous. I want something only he can give me. And nope, this flirting - even though it was good -  wasn't even half as thrilling to make me think about *doing* anything more than flirting for a second or two.  So I had quite obviously pulled an evil typical girl thing - the ego boost. Hmph. Not nice. Oh how I hated that. If he had been in a relationship, too, it all wouldn't have been half as bad, me thinks. Ick. So I thought the rules were there (that this was gonna be flirting, nothing else) when they really weren't. Hmph. Dumb.  Very not elegant. And so I went off to get another drink or whatever else. And next time I look at the dancefloor, Britta and Johannes are smooching. I almost died laughing. There I was, one minute feeling guilty for possibly hurting someone and leading someone on, next minute he is smooching the friend I am at the party with. So the pain can't have been that bad (or he wanted to pay me back, which really didn't work out). It was hilarious. I really hyperventilated because it was so funny. How good I really didn't waste more than a minute on feeling guilty. So the rest of the party was spend laughing about this, dancing some more, drinking some more.  What made me feel bad though was that this was Britta's first kiss (or at least it looked like a kiss, she told me today, they really didn't kiss much. He kissed her face and that was that). And that this was yet another episode of: Caro gets it all (or can get it all), Britta gets nothing. And Johannes settled for the "leftover". Sickening, actually. So the evening faded away, really. It was starting to dawn. Danced some more, almost all alone, which was funky, despite it all, I was in a good mood and felt strong & sexy and good and whatnot. Later, Michel and I sat in the middle of the path between the vineyards and talked. Quite nicely. The girl he had been entertaining all evening was apparently really nice, but he was kinda sad he didn't go along and smooch, too, so we were sitting there being jealous of Britta in a way. And I missed Ev. A lot. Tons. And sitting there, I felt that it was right the way it was. Ev and me, I mean. Being monogamous. Flirting just showed me that while I find the hunt nice and entertaining, the kill really wouldn't give me anything these days. Because the only person I want is Ev.  We left soon afterwards. Despite it all, I gave Johannes my eMail addie. Not because I need more of an ego boost. Just because he is a nice guy I'd like to get to know better. And anyone who is not a law guy is good.  On the way home (riding downhill through the vineyards in the cold of dawn), it dawned on Britta that Johannes had been heavily flirting with me, and when she asked, I told her what happened. Which quite hampered her mood. Oy. She was still quite excited about the possibilty of him calling and whatnot. Oy oy.  Riding a bike after a night of heavy drinking is not always a good idea, actually. Michael and I crashed somewhere near G.town, when he hit the brakes for no apparent reason and I ran into him. Fell all on my left side, injured my elbow (all scratched an bruised) and got myself a nice collection of bruises on my legs, too. But well, there is always  some  kind of loss.  Michel and Britta came home with me (it was 6am by then) and we had some sort of breakfast (tea, coffee, bread rolls for the two of them,  cold leftover pasta for me),  before I fell asleep (or in a coma) on my floor. And the two decided to leave. *lol*. I am not a good hostess. I even removed my make up, brushed my teeth and all before I fell into bed. Woke up after not even 3 hours when I lost my sleeping mask (I sleep best in the dark, and during the day, you can't get my flat dark enough, hence the mask). Ick. No headache. But tiredness. Tiredness. More tiredness. And no clear thoughts. Had a shower. Had the last bit of pasta. Chatted with Linnie. Slept some more later. Didn't get out on the balcony because it was so hot and I feared that the left over alcohol would kill me if I sat in the sun. Didn't get fully up until late in the afternoon, really. Even went to Britta and brought her bike back. She seemed a lot more realistic then earlier in the day. Even though she totally blew this Johannes thing out of proportion. Like making up things that she would say in case he calls. Hmph.  So this was a good party, all in all. A little like being back in High School. *lol* Oh, the drama. I managed to stay on the right amount of alcohol all night. Excellent.  What annoyed me most about this Johannes thing wasn't that someone "got over me" in a matter of minutes (or wanted to make me realize what I missed out on?) but more that it played into the entire problem thing that has been an issue in my friendship with Britta. I am the one who has the boyfriend. The one who is experienced & easy going & whatever else. The one who - on a good night - feels at home in her skin and plays with her charme and flirts, just for the heck of it. The one who can have "someone" whenever she wants (that sure is an exaggeration, but you get my drift, I reckon). Britta is the complete opposite. She has never had a partner. She has never kissed. She has never had sex. She has some issues with insecurity & coming across as the friend type, not the girlfriend type. Her virginity is a stigma for her. Totally. No matter how hard I try to re-assure her it isn't so. Someone who has had plenty of sex can always say it isn't a biggie. And after a few years (5 or so, to be exact), the line does get a little old.  And now this Johannes thing totally played into this thing. Totally. Someone who couldn't *get* me, settled for her. Ick. She gets what I don't want, if she gets anything at all.  Ick. Ick. Ick.  And he knew what he was doing there. No doubt about it. He even commented that he thought she was insecure. How sickening is that?  Anyway. Even though this all sounds rather bad now, in type, I mean. It was indeed a hilarious day & evening. It was fun. Even the drama had an entertaining quality about it. I need more days & nights like this one. Definitely. I need fun and dancing and interesting people and dancing under stars and sitting on hills having strawberry cake and laughing about someone who's pulling a shitty trick and feeling good in missing Ev.  Off to bed now. I need sleep. More sleep. Lots of sleep.

Lovely place, mostly good music, free flowing champagne and wobbly vodka jellies. Got home at 6am. Or was it? Don't know. More Details to follow later (and hell, there are many details to follow). Am. Too. Tired.   *yawn yawn yawn.*

       Happy Birthday to me.   I liked being 22. Not that that was a good year for me at all. But it sounded still young enough to be unsure about what I want to do. 23 is far closer to being in my mid-twenties. Time to grow up? Finally? oy oy oy.   Yesterday night, I felt pretty lonely and sad. Not good, I should have went out and gotten smashed. Oh well. got some nice pressies so far, nice books that I wanted and a webcam (that I can choose myself), too. Lovely. But I still feel kinda lonely. Not good. The sun is shining, I need to get some food soonish and then sit out there on my balcony and enjoy life until Tina will drop by later.  Want some cake?

      It's Friday morning and I am waiting for the repair guys to arrive. Hot water. I will have hot water again. Unbelievable. It has been a week. It really has been good that I have been so busy gym wise. It has been fun. And I am less sore today, yeah. Will prolly go and get a work out tonight, depending on whether I get hold of everyone early enough. I looked at my stomach this morn, and it finally looks & feels streamlined again and is nice and firm. I love my stomach, the muscles there are so strong. Very cool. Took some more self-portraits yesterday, on the fil that already has these window pics I took lying on the scaffolding the other day. This time, I photographed various body parts. *lol* Wonder whether these will come out well at all, I actually doubt it, the camera sucks pretty much at arms length. Took some random shoulder and breast photos. If they do come out, Ev should love them, he loves my shoulders and tits after all. If they don't come out well...then at least the people at the developing place have something to laugh about. :)   My flat is the tidiest it has been in weeks, really, I just need to hoover and wipe over my puter and the desk. And clean the kitchen floor. But anyway. In general, this place is clean. The curtains are open and the sun floats into the room passing the geranias (pink and red; the red one at least looks a little healthier than earlier in the week) and lobelias (dark blue), the little pot with the yellow gerbera daisies and the large pot spilling with allyssum (white) on my balcony. Lovely.  Today shall be busy. Once the repair guys have arrived & installed the new hot water thing I should shower and get my bum to ProFa. Looking forward to working with Gerhard. I'll be there till three, from there straight to Dr.K. The rest of the day shall be spend contacting people who might want to come along tomorrow and shopping for some food and drink. It really is odd. I am so NOT in the mood to celebrate my birthday. Going to Fritz's party is lovely. It won't be about me. But the thought of people coming here just *because* of me. Ick. I have been so antisocial lately and have neglected so many people that the idea of asking them to come celebrate feels fake. I just don't think my birthday is very important this year. Sure, I am excitedly waiting for whatever might come in the mail from Ev, (and everyone else who is far away yet loves me for that matter), but a real celebration? Don't really feel like it. Hmph. I'd so much prefer this day to be just over. Tomorrow, I mean. Let's just skip it. Let me unpack my pressies, have fun at Fritz' party...but let's forget about it being my birthday, really. I feel so antisocial just wanting to celebrate it with Tina and Michel. Britta will come along, too, but then...I feel bad wanting to call Silke for this. Or Felix. Or anyone else for that matter. Anyway. It's just my birthday. It isn't really terribly important in the grand scheme of things.  I just wish I could throw a girly party with Lin and Kitten and Heather and whoever else who would want to come along. Some nice cocktails and shopping for nail polish at Sephora. Or for lingerie. Or for some cool harnasses with flames. Or whatever, you get my drift. Hmph. Or a day with Ev. Sleeping in, having wake up sex, breakfast somewhere, a loungy day without worries at a nice sunny place. I miss him. A lot.   Oh well.  Finally made Michel's birthday tape last night. It's a pretty summery if melancholic  "sitting on the balcony on a summer evening sipping some cooled white wine"  - kinda tape. I'd actually keep it, it turned out nice, and surprisingly, both sides end perfectly, without any calculating. Quite amazing. It's not outrageous in any way, really. It's just stuff I like, put together.

      Kiwis are very inventive people. Bungee Jumping (even though that idea was stolen from some natives in Papua-NewGuinea). Cookie Time cookies. These odd large rubber balls in which you can roll down a hill.   urlLink Now they are putting a good use to all that fur of the run over useless possums on the West Coast.     Nipple warmers a standout success    15 June 2001  By NICOLA BOYES    What's cute, fuzzy and slips inside your bra on a cold winter morning? The hottest thing at this year's Fieldays near Hamilton - possum skin nipple warmers.  West Coast company Gray Fur Trading sold more than 500 nipple warmers in their first day of trading at Mystery Creek, though owner Peter Gray says sales could be attributed to the -1 degree frost.  "Some people came through and brought half a dozen while others just brought one set. Mothers have picked them up saying "oh I have to take something home for my daughter". "It's just a big laugh really." Mr Gray said the nipple warmers are made out of possum skin off-cuts and slip inside a bra "fur to nipple". "I've heard they're very warm." He says they are just the ticket for those often embarrasing cold mornings in the cowshed.  Mr Maunganui fashion design student Leigh Johnson tried the nipple warmers out at yesterday's Fieldays. "They really are quite warm aren't they? They're good, really soft." Since the company started making the nipple warmers about one year ago Mr Gray said they have had orders from as far away as America. "One lady called up wanting 2000 of them. They're quite serious about them over there." First time exhibitors at the Fieldays, Mr Gray said it is also the first time anyone from the South Island's West Coast has run a site at the event.    urlLink Obviously, wearing these nipple warmers makes you smile rather dumbly.   Still a funky idea. I'd definitely want one.  :)  (through  urlLink supermodels are lonelier than you think )

      I am so SORE today. It's unbelievable. Went to an hour of Body Pump yesterday, which was really nice, but apparently I just didn't stretch enough, I don't know. I feel this nice pull in my pecs and shoulders, but my legs just hurt like hell. Spend an hour on the cross trainer with low impact around noon today (to earn my shower at the gym) and stretched a lot later, and it's still not better. Ouch. I need a massage.

      I have realised that I am overly annoyed by the latest Persil (I think it is) washing powder advertisement. It's this little story about a girl moving in with her guy. She tells us that the first thing she did when they moved in together was her getting rid of the greyish towels. And that now, the only thing she needs to get rid off is the ugly old wine bottle he uses as a candle holder and that he loves to death.  I just don't like this: I'll go and change my partner attitude.  Sucks. Rude. So very female, too. If I ever choose to move in with Ev, I'll even let him keep that CD thing Psychobitch made for him. Hah! Talk about acceptance. :)

Know though, that the real site will take ages. Oy oy. Anyway.  Am half watching the first ever episode of emergency room, too. Lovely. Oh, the old times.

      I had a lovely night out. Spontaneously. Gerhard, my new colleague at Planned Parenthood called at 9:30 and said one of his mates had won tickets for the premiere of  urlLink "The Replacements"  and whether I wouldn't want to come along. So I threw on some Jeans and off I went and it was an entertaining evening, really. A beer, some net chat and whatnot, and a dumb football centered predictable movie that was nonetheless quite entertaining. I really laughed a lot about the predictability and the overly simplified characters, and it was just fun, yes.  Lovely. Just what I needed, actually. Very nice that he thought about me when they had those spare tickets. Nice nice nice.

      So I've been lazy with my blog. Didn't have much to say, really. Anything I would have said yesterday would have been lots of swearing, basically, because I have no warm water at the moment. The warm water thing broke, and the idiot who was supposed to repair it claimed that he needed some extra parts that he didn't have but would magically have on Monday morning at 7am. Oh, sure. What bullshit.  Because showering with ice cold water sucks, I went to the gym this morn, stinky and all, to get more stinky and have a shower there. How icky, really.  Oh well.  Didn't do much yesterday and today, the weather is pretty sucky (lots of rain & thunder & lightning) and I was sleepy and headachy and spent lots of time reading. Gave up on  urlLink "American Psycho"  last night, because I reached the first ickiest killing scene (where Pat Bateman nails his ex Bethany to the floor) and decided that this isn't the moment for reading about bitten off nipples and rats in vaginas and bitten of private parts. The book still is hilariously funny partly, and so very 80's, but right now that violence...uhm, no thanks. Don't even know why I started re-reading it. - What was I thinking? Started  urlLink Glamorama  instead, lets see how far that gets. Just feel like reading some Bret Easton Ellis, I want some superficiality and catchy writing, but not those super-drastic killing and torture scenes, Glamorama is at least partly tamer. Even though I still vividly remember that cut off penis scene and the death through an overdose of RU-486 (even though that is medically impossible, not well researched, Mr.Ellis). Yeah.  It's all pretty ok at the mo. Got an eMail from my friend Xan from Oz and he and his theatre group have been invited to a festival over here, so I shall see him (and his fabulous fabulous play) as soon as what - in 10 days? Unbelievable. So am looking forward to that. Had a lovely phone call with my boy today, too, who was adorable and nice, if very sick and very male in insisting this was no reason to stop working out. The little work out addict. :) Weird that he has transformed into this work out machine lately. Hope I can keep up with him. Need to work out more. Oy. It was all very adorable and nice, and I felt close to him. All the way it should be. He dreamt of me the other day. How lovely. Reminds me that I need to take care of that eMail that's been sitting here for a while.  Cleaned up my computer today, too, streamlined my desktop and chose a new desktop pic. Lovely - even though I swear it will get odd comments if anyone ever sees that. *lol*. Me the evil, odd things liking gal. Hehehe.  I actually stumbled over a surprisingly good german BDSM site,  urlLink lustschmerz , yesterday, too. Am mucho impressed by the standard, even though they still miss some basics and put quite a bit of focus on things I personally am not  and will never be interested in (and their art is...not to my taste, either. ick leather. ick.). However, decent in regards to Safer Sex issues, and very good on current happenings, too. Also stumbled over the worlds worst amateur website that nearly made me throw up. It was so bad I won't link to it.  urlLink Lin  couldn't access it (Porn is, after all, not allowed in Singapore, even though she could, till now, get to everything - so maybe the law in Singapore actually provides quality control?), so I send her some pics and she agreed wholeheartedly. Icky fake breasts, icky dark tan, icky long pink fingernails. And above all: ICKY ICKY ICKY unsafe sex. Cumshot photos make me throw up, if I know that the ugly man at the other end of that penis is just a regular member of that site and not a pro. Unprotected oral sex. Unprotected anal sex without lube (that's what that person actually said herself) with ejaculation. How very uncool. And how very unsexy. Ick. Does anyone ever find that appealing?  All was good at Profa on Friday, btw. (wow, from bad amateur websites to volunteering? very elegant.) Met Gerhard, the new volunteer, for the first time, and we got along extremely well. We're going to work on the website together, and if Friday was any indication, it should be a lot of fun, really. We do like the same things style wise, and that should all work out well. Plus he is a pro, too, which was a very delightful change to all those web-illiterates.  Anyway. That much for the mo, really. More soonish.

      I wish I could somehow save the colour of the sky at this very moment.  It rained, heavily, for the past few hours. But now the clouds have lifted partly, and the sun going down in the west throws a pink reflection on the clouds over the houses outside my window. They glow. Pink. Orange. Against a blueish sky.  Damn beautiful.  It's the little things in life, indeed.

      *sings* "...if there is pain in your heart....give it a name....give this thing a name and say it again and again................"   For 13DM, I just managed to get hold of  urlLink "88-95 best of: live"  by  urlLink The Jeremy Days . Fabulous. So right now I am cleaning up my place, dancing around in a sports top and boxers singing at the top of my lungs. Excellent.  This is such a nice album. So early 90's when there actually was a decent German Music scene (with the Jeremy Days, and  urlLink Fury in the Slaughterhouse  and  urlLink Nationalgalerie  and whoever else); and just like any other decent live album, this makes me wish I had been there, it makes me happy and emotional and just sounds very good and alive and perfect. And like the early 90's. Like being in school. Like lusting for certain people. Like beers on summer nights. Like those parties at the P-Dorf, when Jane and I would wear hippie clothes from our moms.   Like....damn good times we all had.

      Oh, I am so lazy today. So very lazy. Haven't done much more than lounging around, sleeping, sitting in the sun, sleeping some more and reading. Finished Dave Eggers  urlLink "A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius: Based on a True Story"  which is, all in all, a pretty decent book about life in the 90's. I quite liked the "odd" style, really. Very recommendable. Have started American Psycho again, not that I know why. Oh well.  Should get some dinner sometime soonish.

      Last night was lovely. Window shopping with  urlLink Heather  for a few hours at places whose names I have sworn not to to disclose. Lovely. I need money. I need some things from there. Found  urlLink a dress at Esprit that I really want , too, and that looks very *me*. And that is on sale. Oy. It was very very entertaining, indeed, overall. Met  urlLink Shauny  and  urlLink Linnie , too, and watched the late night re-run of Buffy and all was well. How's that for multi-tasking? Went to bed at almost 4am....and could sleep in. Oh, how I love public holidays....the only upside of living in an almost completely catholic state.  Anyway. Off to enjoy the sunshine, while it lasts. Supposed to rain later. Not that it looks like it. But better to be efficient, eh?

      Wearing my Sexbomb shirt apparently makes me evil.  Good night out with Michel. No biergarten (started to rain) but cocktails at Maria's instead (whichw ere rather poor in quality, but served the purpose). Interesting conversation about this, Porn and sex (mainly). Very personal.  And nope, I did not talk about monogamy as enthusiatically to convince myself. Very odd, for the first time in my life, really, I do not want anything but my boy. Seriously. I am amazed and impressed, yet again.  Anyway. Nice evening. We should have more of these, Michel & me.

      Good day today.  Relatively sweet and softy session with Dr.K, and that was okay that way. A very good time at ProFa, where we discussed the latest stuff for the men's party that we are organising. Showed off the homepage I made (just the pre version really, nothing fancy at all), and Sabine was very impressed. Was very good for my ego.  Spend some time online, chatted to my lovely boy (who I can't get out of my head, really, am so very happy that he'll come over soon!), had a late lunch. All well, really.   And now I am soon off for a few beers with Michel at the biergarten with  urlLink this view . Let's just hope it won't start to rain now. :)  Life is good.

      Men are pussies.  The Evil Painter Guys did not dare to enter my hallway this morn, because there were blood spots all over the floor. They feared there was a body somewhere. And so the knock on my balcony door and tell me that.(No, I don't get the Why? either), so I get dressed and look, and sure there is no body. But very scared, dumb painters.  Men!   *lmao*

      Am watching  urlLink CNN  and am troubled by weird emotions. For Timothy McVeigh, I mean. Here is the world, counting down the last hours of his life. I can't really say what exactly I feel here. I am not sorry. Or just not *just* sorry. Not sorry in the real sense of sorry, because he committed the bombings in Oklahoma well knowing what this might hold for him in the end. You live somewhere, you know the laws. You act accordingly. And if not, you get the result you *deserve*. I am not just *sorry* because he seems to enjoy the media attention, and the martyrdom he will reach through being executed for an attack against the US federal government, which will make him an icon in the fading militia movement. But still, somewhere, under the disgust at that guy who drove that Ryder truck in front of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma on April 19th, 1995 (goodness, those April days are dangeours...Waco, Columbine, Oklahoma, Hitler's birthday...) which resulted in the killing of 168 people, and the injury of about 850, I am sorry for him. Somehow sorry. Even though I can understand that people say: "If you have the death penalty, this is the case when you have it."  It's the death penalty, really. I don't excuse McVeighs actions here, at all. What he did was evil, he is guilty, he has confessed (if outside the courtroom) and he deserves punishment. But not this. No one deserves this. Sitting on death row, and being killed by a state.  It won't make the family's pain who have lost loved ones go away. It might bring some closure. But it won't eliminate their pain.  I think what makes the death penalty unjust and cruel punishment  is what is happening right now, that waiting for "the day". The rituals. The last meal. The time frame during which things happen leading up to the execution. The fact this happens either at midnight or early in the morning.  How do you feel, being locked up in the cell near the killing room? How do you feel, sitting in your cell, behing watched, waiting for them to get you? How do you feel seeing your time ticking away? How do you feel, lying on that guerney, hearing the last words you will ever hear (which in McVeigh's case will apparently be "we are ready")? It will sound absolutely ridiculous if I say that an episode of 21 Jump Street (titled:"2245")  largely influenced my stand on the death penalty, but 'tis the truth. They showed the execution of this guy who looked like Anthony Kiedis for a crime his girlfriend committed after a policeman had made a mistake (if I remember that correctly).  And how do the people involved feel? The wardens who dress him for the last time, those who tie him to the guerney. How do you feel you are the last one touching someone who is about to be killed. Adjusting a ECG knowing this person will die. How do you feel as the person who is tricked into believing  "it's not me that's causing this"  because two people press a button to release the triple injection. What do thee witnesses feel. Or the lawyers. Or the family of the convicted killer.  Apart from this being cruel and unusual punishment in general (and how can a state say that killing is wrong and then kill, too?), I personally think killing McVeigh with all this attention, discussing the flavour of the ice cream that constituted his last dinner, this entire media circus, is not helping at all. If they had put him into some prison where he would have stayed for the rest of his life, it would have slowed down. And no one would have cared, say 5, 10, 15 years down the road. But now, he is sacrificing himself by not fighting this execution anymore, and will forever be up there as someone who died "because he fought" the US government.  This is all sickening. Very very sickening.  And I wonder whether we won't hear sometime today, which company manufactured the ice cream McVeigh had. So how shall the PR people of Ben'n'Jerry's, Baskin Robbins or Häagen Dasz react?  Be appalled or say:   "Well, we'd choose our ice cream as a last meal, too."  ?    urlLink I feel like burning an American flag.

The special reports: fancy music,  urlLink "THE EXECUTION OF TIMOTHY MCVEIGH"  flashing on the TV screen. It's so mideaval. So full of revenge. Sure, McVeigh killed 168 people, he says he is guilty, but I personally am all for life without parole instead of killing someone.  urlLink McVeigh 'wants this to come about' ">He even says he wants to be executed because life without parole were worse.

Very odd. Caro at just barely 16, Stephan, Jane, Thorsten, Tim, everyone. I listen to it every once in a while. Every year or so, and it's funny and sad at the same time. Makes me sentimental.

       somewhere in the nowehere of icq, 10:14pm, Saturday, June 9th 2001     Caro:  yeah, I just don't want to expect too much. plus I am still so *innovation* less. I mean, I don't have any picture in my head what life could be like so that I am happy...I am all floating around here, so...  Caro:  kinda hard to describe, sorry  BruinDan:  oh no, it makes perfect sense actually.  BruinDan:  I was the opposite...I had all these hopes and dreams that were furthered by a girlfriend....and then the floor collapsed from under me.  BruinDan:  So now I am much like you..kind of drifting along not knowing what my life could be, not knowing what direction I am headed in, and looking for something to hold on to.  Caro:  welcome to the club  Caro:  it's very odd, I have like *no* vision of what my life should be like. very sad in a way  BruinDan:  I hear ya.  I think this is all part of growing up, we have these ideals when we are young and one by one they fall apart until we realize we have *no* clue which way we are supposed to be going.  BruinDan:  Thats why this breakup is so hard for me.  I thought I had found what I needed, and so did she.  Then everything suddenly changed and now I am lost.  Caro:  we sound very gen-x here, dan   Like straight out of a Douglas Coupland novel. Duh.

      So I mentioned briefly that I was tempted to go to NYC next month. I am very tempted, thanks J. for making things worse! :)  All started when Heather mentioned sometime this week that she was wondering whether I it would be cheap to hop over the big pond to join her in NY for the webzine convention & panel discussion that allowed sexuality sites to participate for the first time. Hm. So I looked into flights. Looked at my empty account. Imagined myself in New York, the only place in the US apart from San Francisco that I really want to see. Saw yellow cabs, and the Chrysler building and whatever else. Thought about meeting all those people I really want to see and that I really need to meet them before I make my way downunder, just because I'll be so much further away from them.  But.  Really, as much as I would love to go, and as tempting it is to fly over and meet all those fabbo people (and on top of it all: J!)....nah. I just don't think it's gonna work. Not this time.     The dollar sucks muchly at the moment, and the little money that I have is worth nothing over there. It would be very expensive, even if I score a cheap flight. We're talking roughly 2 1/2 times my monthly allowance.  Borrowing money from the bank is impossible. I'd hence have to borrow money from the parentals (which is tricky and not desirable in itself) and somehow explain why I am going. And going to NY and not to Australia. Duh. And as lovely as my rents are and as lovely and understanding they are and as much as they want me to travel, I am not quite sure whether any money would make its way to me if I told them the real deal about all my online activities and this trip.  Even if I found a non-parental way to finance this trip (aka Fabian's Lufthansa miles), I would still have to explain it.  So even if I could find a way to pay for this, how can I be mad at Ev for wanting to go other places but here, tell him I can't come to see him this year yet spend at least 2000DM (i.e one flight to Australia) on a 7 day trip to NY?  Plus The timing isn't ideal: the semester will still be on. And I will hopefully go to see U2 at just around that time in Cologne.    So.  I am afraid my rational self has to prevail here. If it was a month later...maybe. If it wasn't this year where I really need to get through that one law class.  If it wasn't for the hole in my account. If it wasn't for Australia next year (and the 24.000$ AUS that I will need for tuition alone). And for the U2 concert. But under these circumstances....nope. It just wouldn't really work. :( Quelle bummer.

       urlLink Roll your own blackout.    Global Solstice Event on Thursday, June 21st 2001, from 7-10pm worldwide, all time zones   "In protest of George W. Bush's energy policies and lack of emphasis on efficiency, conservation and alternative fuels, there will be a voluntary rolling blackout on the first day of summer, June 21 at 7pm - 10pm in any time zone (this will roll it across the planet).  It's a simple protest and a symbolic act. Turn out your lights from 7pm-10pm on June 21. Unplug whatever you can unplug in your house. Light a candle, kiss and tell, make love, tell ghost stories, do something instead of watching television, have fun in the dark. Forward this e-mail as widely as possible, to your government representatives and environmental contacts.  Let them know we want global education, participation and funding in conservation, efficiency and alternative fuel efforts-and an end to over exploitation and misuse of the earth's resources."   Cute idea, unfortunately not too well organised. I bet in the 70's, it would have worked.

      In case you happen to be in Milan this month, make sure you head to via Marconcelli 14, to see "Love, Donna", an exhibition by photographer Donna Ferrato. Fascinating, diverse views into "love" (whatever that is) and all it's variations.  If no trip to Milan is on your schedule, I recommend buying this month's italian edition of "Marie Claire", they have a special section on "love" this month and 12 pages with pictures from the exhibition.

      The EPGs have painted my balcony floor a weird shade of beige. It looks very sandy. Very Saharan. Very warm. Quite strange: It's been raining all day, yet the wet balcony floor looks inviting and warm and nice. Obviously a good colour choice.  Hm. I might not need to purchase the wooden planks I wanted to get. This looks pretty enough the way it is now. And now the excitement: what colour will the shade things get?

      I usually enjoy shopping. Even shopping for everyday things, groceries, whatnot, but it has to be at a good supermarket, not the cheap but crappy "penny-markt" near Uni, where you feel like in the german democratic republic, circa 1982, because by 5pm, when you crawl out from beneath your law books and into the world, most things you want that day are probably sold out. At Penny Markt, shopping is adventurous: the local alcoholics and the punks that lie around on the Uni lawn shop for their beer and korn and breathe into your face when you stand in the never ending line to finally pay your few DMs and get out. Yeah. It's a classic experience, that supermarket, actually, the check out ladies and men are classically ugly, classically unfriendly, classically rude. But it's cheap. Enough of a reason. Cheap food is tolerable.  But I wanted to write about the pleasure and non-pleasure of shopping....I really enjoy shopping at  urlLink dm . dm rocks. It's a drugstore, and features all the products needed to make me feel good, almost everything needed for worship in my temple (aka the bathroom). A good subsitute for "boots - the chemist" which I just love to shreds. dm is the only place where you can get brand  cosmetics for a price even lower than the one printed on it. Shopping there is fun. Even shopping for something like...say toilet cleaner, shopping for washing up liquid  (shall I take the yellow pril smelling like lemons, the eco-friendly Frosch one made of real lemons or the palmolive anti-bacterial one that's orange and would hence look best in my kitchen?  - the Orange one of course). Shopping for nail-polish. Shopping for....anything. Tina is my partner in crime. She loves dm, too. We can spend time there, sniffing on things, looking at colours, discussing new cleaning products, wondering why we react to advertisements that feature Sarah Michelle Gellar, wasting time. Shopping there lifts our mood. My  urlLink payback  card loves dm, too, I have loaded most of the points that I will one day swap against a soda streamer at dm.  So I enjoy shopping for things at dm. For anything there.  Well, anything but - deodorant, that is.  Deodorant shopping sucks. Shampoo shopping sucks a little, every few months when I decide I am fed up with my brand and need a new one (switched from Fructis to John Frieda "blonde" to Herbal Essences to El'Vital to...I am not very consistent with shampoo) I stand in front of the shelf clueless, staring at the colourful bottles, but it's not half as bad as deodorant shopping.  Let me explain: I am usually brand-consious and brand-clingy. If you win my heart once, I am yours. If you produce and market any kind of cosmetics and can convince me to buy it once, and make me like your product, I will keep buying and buying. Until you, the evil producer, decide to not produce the product anymore. Or tempt me with a "new & improved" version. Or whatever else. Shopping in another country is usually an adventure of it's own for me. If I am not in tune with local marketing or can't find something I already know, it can be pretty hard. However, if I've been subjected to enough local mags though, it's fun and entertaining. I know already that if I ever happen to be in the US, I will bring home several bottles of Jergen's "Skin Smoothing Lotion".  I am every marketer's dream, really, a member of such a nice, well defined target group. So reactive to some kinds of advertisement. Daring to try out new things.  Somehow though, all deodorant producers have failed me. They just haven't convinced me yet that I need THEIR product or won't be happy otherwise. I use something but do not cling to the product. I find myself standing in front of that shelf, unable to make a decision, a little overwhelmed. There simply is too much choice in the deodorant shelf, while there is no choice really, because so many products just suck. Too much choice = no choice.  Up there on the big shelf, lined up like soldiers are the deodorants and anti-perspirants and all their sub-divisions: sprays (pump-action), sprays (can), roll-ons, sticks, creme-sticks, wipes, brand or generic, deo-crystals, "sensitive" and "intensive" choices...the list is endless, really.  So how about a roll on? Nicely practical and quick drying, but those 24 hour ones (and this is apparently the only variety out there, no matter what brand) only seem to come in two varieties, either pure stinky mineral solutions (yeah, the smell of aluminium!) or in fake-flowery. Yuk. So these are a no-no. As are those that smell like pure alcohol (the smell suggest that it hurts to apply that on frehly shaven pits). Then there's Nivea, a nice trusted brand for lots of things. But their deo...sucks. Nivea deo in all it's application forms (roll on, spray, wipes) smells too much like Nivea and I don't want that in my armpit surrounding me like a cloud of Nivea sticky cleanliness. Just doesn't smell well with say...Jean-Paul Gaultier. Or my Lush Body Powder. Same goes for impulse. It stinks. It sucks. Yuk. I am not their target group after all, I am not 14 and like Britney Spears. (Even though I admit owning on of their products because it's called ICQ. Don't use it though, hide it below my sink somewhere, next to other unused products.). The packaging of Impulse products looks ugly, too. So as a general rule, pure deodorants and everything in an evil ozone-layer-killing can is a no-no for me, and deo crystals are a little too eco for me, too. So the choice is smaller, but still.   So how about a simple anti-perspirant? - Well, even the smell of something as evil as Rexona Ultra or Hidro-Fugal make me think of clogged sweat glands and the necessary operations to open them up again. So yet another no-no. I actually did give one a chance a while back, a "sensitive" formula, that really wasn't --uhm--  (*blushes*)  strong enough. So it was hence never bought again.  So how about a stick application then? Well, thanks, but no thanks. Sticks leave that yucky residue. It sucks on sleeveless blacks, it stains white shirts and turns the underarms area a nice light yellow, no matter how well you wash. Tina ruined all her shirts with it one year (we think it has something to do with a chemical reaction between product - sweat - washing powder). I ruined a good amount of my white shirts and a jumper in the first summer "Secret" was available in Germany (I had been tempted by US advertising for it for a good while before that). So sticks are a no-no, too.  Which basically just leaves the creamy formulations. Which are tricky because one needs to stay away from the old fashioned *creamy-creamy* products (ick! Nivea! ick! ick!). And from the metallic-smelling formulations (so Rexona Creme is out, too). And from those that just don't appeal to my sense of what's good packaging. Oy. Which basically just leaves me to choose between the different smells of one product. See: too much choice = no choice.  I take a little sniff at the 5 variations of that one brand, am disgusted by the one with a little white label, almost naeuseous after smelling on those with the pink and violet lables (and have to remember one horrible day at work at Arthur Andersen in 1999, when I used the pink variety that I had gotten as a tester, and almost threw up during the day because of the smell of my *own* deodorant), but am then transformed back in time and space (1996, NZ, "Degree" deodorant, purchased at K-Mart at Riccarton Mall) by the one with the little greenish label. So I look for one without a smeared applicator part, find one at the back of the shelf and drop it into my basket, with a sigh.  As I stand at the check out (Corny Muesli bars Choco, all cotton o.b. comfort mini, and a bar of Nivea soap also on the check out belt, next to the Deo) I am not content with what's lying there, even though the smell is ok, even though it worked okay before. So this is not a first purchase. No excitement that carrying home something new brings you. I feel like I had no choice and am not content with my soon-to-be purchase. I *had* to buy that product, not because I was convinced it rocked, but because all others simply sucked.  So as I hand my payback card over to the check out girl I send a psychic message to the makers of "Secret Satin Dry Creme Nature Fresh" as my money trasnfers on weird ways, into their accounts:     No. No. No. The fact that I am buying your product doesn't mean you've convinced me. You have FORCED me. You need better marketing. And better competitors. No. No. No. I do not like you. You should make me feel good about purchasing your product.    And I know that next time I need some deo, when this one is empty, I will stand in front of the shelf for 5 minutes again, follow the same line of thought and leave just as discontent, with probably the same purchase.  Duh.  urlLink Je suis une freak.

        Re:BRITNEY SPEARS GIVES GOOD HEAD   Britney Spears Sucking Cock Jennifer Love Hewitt Getting Ass Fucked NO Credit Card Needed EVER   A new highlight of crappy wannabe-porn eMails.  I seriously wonder whether anyone reacts to this. First of all: Why Britney Spears? I can understand why someone wants to see her nude and not...say...Christian Aguilera (ICK!). But still. And the whiney Jennifer Love Hewitt? Goodness, after seeing one episode of Party of Five, if I were male, I could never ever get aroused by watching her.  And on a more general note: get real people, if there was footage of Britney Spears doing  anything  sexual, wouldn't we see it in a  decent yellow press paper as soon as it got public and not hear about it in some crappy eMail?   (Yes, today is not the best day, and I am just ever so slightly edgy today)

       urlLink "The Times"  reported this week:    Blonde lawyers don't have more fun     BY LAURA PEEK     FAIR-HAIRED lawyers in the United States have declared a National Blonde Day to dispel the myth of the dumb blonde. They are fed up with people ignoring their law degrees and seeing their hair as a stupidity signal.  The Blonde Legal Defence Club has been established by a group of lawyers in Los Angeles to support anyone who has been treated wrongly for their follicular appearance. Its mission is to stop the widespread belief that blondes are dumb and incapable, to destroy blonde stereotypes and to publicise blonde accomplishments throughout history, dispelling the myths and mistakes about blondes.   Icons from Marilyn Monroe to Robert Redford have complained that their hair colouring has led to their work being taken less seriously. Indeed, a new Hollywood film, Legally Blonde, addresses the issue. A fashion student is rejected by her ambitious boyfriend because her platinum-coloured hair would make her an unsuitable political wife. She becomes a star student at Harvard Law School to prove him wrong. The Harvard Law Bulletin wrote about the film and suggested that prejudice over hair colour is real among professional women, even those with Harvard law degrees.   Weve had to endure untold hardships, Fern Magnin, of the Blonde Club, said. Were not going to stand for it any more. National Blonde Day is on July 9.  (through  urlLink supermodels are lonelier than you think)     I can relate. So how shall I celebrate National Blonde Day?  urlLink Anyone an idea?

I need to get myself some motivation:  *mantra*  Caro, you can do this. You'll do it well. You'll enjoy it, even. Think about how good you'll feel when you hand it in!   In addition, I just heard that one of my fave teachers, my politics teacher from grade 9 and 10, Herr Koch, died yesterday, at age 57, from lung cancer. Very sad. Am not sure whether I shall send a card to his family, they wouldn't know me, but then....hm...... May he be happier and healthier wherever he is now. May the higher powers be good to him.

      So I am back.  I just discovered, that my notice of absence wasn't up. Duh. It posted but ot published somehow, when I left it about 3 minutes before I left my flat on Friday morn to catch my train.  The weekend was okay, but right now I feel sad and lonely and tired. And whatever else. But I think I shall start ...where...on Thursday?  Yes. Tina's party on  Thursday . It all started pretty okay, but somewhere along the line, something went wrong. I don't know. I think I just missed the right time to get terribly smashed myself and not find everyone as stupid as I did. Maybe I have simply lost the ability to hold meaningless conversations. Maybe I can't flirt anymore. In any case, something went wrong, and it jsut sucked. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, just not me. And when I decided to get smashed, no alcohol that I tolerate was left. Tina was practically bouncing off the walls, being happily drunk and bold and whatever. And I just stood there and just felt lonely and boring and sad and pathetic and ugly. To top everything off, when I decided that catching a cab home was the best thing I could do, I asked Michel whether he wanted to stay or leave or whatever, and he made a ridiculous statement about him *needing* me there and wanting me there and *not being able to live without me*. Or whatever. I have forgotten half of it already. I would have usually laughed about it and not cared very much, but on top of this party that was fun for everyone but me, it sucked. Very very much. I know, I shouldn't take this serious. But still. I mean, we had that trouble before. Yes, it's lovely to get attention from him (from anyone, though, too), and it has been lovely ever since I met him back in November, but in the grand scheme of things, I had simply hoped that we were over that crap.  Oh well.  When I came home on early Friday morn, I whined about that online to J. for a while. Hm. I still am not sure whether it was good to share all this. But then. Why not? Why the hell not?  Anyway. I slept for like 2 hours before I had to get up and ready to leave on  Friday  morn. The train ride sucked. I was tired. I sat in a sucky compartment with sucky people. I slept for big chunks of time. Arrived home at 1pm, mom picked me up at the train station. got my hair cut in the afternoon, did some washing, visited grandma, and got myself blisters so evil while wearing my Campers without socks (yes, I am dumb, yes, I should have known that barefoot soles are NOT enough, yes, yes, yes) that I had to get some backless shoes to be able to walk. Seriously. Very sucky. My Dad was kind enough to go shoe shopping with me, which is always hassle free and nice, and I left the shop with some nice sporty black slides and a pair of  urlLink strappy slides  (that look very much like my old ones). My rents and I went out for dinner that night, some cheap, unpretentious greek food, which always reminds me of my summer camps and late night drinking. Yum.   Saturday , I finally went on a successful shopping spree. It had been ages, really, and while going alone sure wasn't very entertaining (I hate it), and while the mall was crowded, crowded, crowded, I did find some nice pants ( urlLink relatively straight medium wide 7/8 stretchy khaki pants ), a nice knitted top ( urlLink with bold beige, red & white stripes ) and a few basic T-Shirts from GAP. At least something, I reckon. Did try lots of things on and thought about lots of things, and decided that all my recent working out DOES make a difference about how I feel when looking at evil mall mirrors. Found a nice skirt at GAP, but as usual, I was between sizes, and it just didn't look nice. Duh. Had a little fit at Esprit, who just opened (apparently one of 5 worldwide) giant flagship stores at my mall. Why do they think size 10 is the biggest they should make? aaarrrgh. Anyway.  Came home tired and crabby until my mood was lifted by a  urlLink Chicken Supreme . I swear, it is the only burger I have ever eaten in my entire life. The only fast food I *really* like and eat these days. And I love it to death. Yum. (*sings*  "...all the places you have been trying to find a chicken supreme a chicke supreme....." ) Was a good girl for the rest of the day, visited my grandmom, made a cake for the visit to my brothers place, watched TV with the parentals. All very tame. Slept in a little on  Sunday , read a sucky book called "God's brain" which was less than sci-fi B-movie material (someone basically goes around stealing brains from top scientists, throws the brains of the 7 top scientists into a big petri dish, adds some stuff to connect them and causes the end of the world. whoopeee!). Talked to Ev on the phone for half an hour. Visited grandmother again, drove to D. to visit Fabian and his girlfriend in Fabians pretty new flat. Nice afternoon was had by all. My cake was yummy, I had a good chat with Cordu (even though there are only bad news in regards to her Dad's health), Fabian did indeed get me some italian women's mags on one of his recent business trips to Milano. I am a sucker for italian editions of Elle, Vogue and Marie Claire, simply because they make for good loo reading and make me look oh-so-sophisticated. *lol* Sunday night, I watched a movie on Prague with my dad (he's going there next week and I am as jealous as hell) and read some more. And  Today  was basically spend packing, on a train, unpacking, catching up with everyone online.  A boring weekend, in all, I s'pose, but it was good.  So why the hell am I feeling so low now? I simply feel very lonely. Lost. Whatever. I just feel like no one cares about me. No one picks me up at the train station. No one. I miss having a relationship. I miss having a life. I miss being desired. When the train stopped at Frankfurt airport, I could have just jumped out and caught the next plane...somewhere. I just don't want to be where I am right now. I want to be feel at home somewhere, with someone. I miss feeling close to Ev, which I just don't feel right now. I read  urlLink grim's latest entry  and what  urlLink Kate  wrote about his leaving, and it just made me extra sad, on top of it all. I had that intensity, too. Sometime in the  past. I wish someone would miss me, too. I wish I knew that Ev does that. I really don't know. And it just makes me so tired of it all. This loneliness and unhappiness and role playing. So tired of life.    Hello darkness my old friend.

I want to cross one last finish line as my stud wife and my ten children applaud, and then I want to lie down in a field of those famous French sunflowers and gracefully expire, the perfect contradiction to my once-anticipated poignant early demise."

And I always thought people would get after a while, that not calling back sends a message that means  "no, thank you" . But she quite obviously didn't get that part. And thought calling my parents was a good way to find out whether I was okay. The bitch. I am so fucking angry, I can't tell you. Fucking angry.  I don't want to have anything to do with someone who makes me feel like shit so why the hell doesn't she get lost? Does she want me to tell her to do so? Yeah.  Fuck off, Britta. Just fuck off.

      Am a bit better today. Not spectacular, but better.  Slept well last night and dreamt lots. Had one very bizarre and scary dream (that I thankfully have forgotten the details off) and one oh-so-amazing dream featuring Ev that felt very very real and was all nice and specific and great. Surprisingly enough, he seems to have had a similar dream last night. At least something, eh? This dream probably was the result of all those longing thoughts from yestersay (or the pre-freezed sheets?). *sigh* Can't wait to see him again. Really can't wait to see him.  Woke up nice and early and decided to use those first few cool hours of the day and went online and promptly met Ev and had a nice little chat with him (even though icq discussions really aren't anything like the real thing). He's going to a party where Jen will be today, and it really doesn't bother me. At all. Oh, how long have I wanted to feel that way? Went to bed again for another hour of dozing (and freezing! now that felt great to be cold!) and then got ready to get food for the weekend, including a little bottle of champagne which shall be had when Lance wins tomorrow. Oh, how I will miss the tour. Already over again, these three weeks passed by very quickly.  In any way, it's all pretty ok now. Am not feeling fantastic, but okay, and that's an improvement, after all. It's very very hot over here, and I wear as little as possible and try not to move too much or move away from my little ventilator. It really is too hot to work out or to sit in the sun. I think instead of going to the gym tomorrow morn, I'll go for a swim at the open air pool instead, really early in the morn (before the families and teens are there). I really am a bit worried about doing any other kind of work out, it's just too fucking hot, really, and the ozone levels are very high. I bet working out now would kill me. I have notices that I see little flashes at the edges of my field of vision sometimes (even when I am just sitting around) and just know that this weather isn't too good for me. I need to drink more. duh. Am not made for this weather. 5° less would be better. Oh well, shouldn't whine.  Well, well. Am not in the greatest blogging mood, really, and not just because my brain is a bit too warm. Was all silent yesterday, simply because I was away for much of the day working at Planned Parenthood (which was good, even though I was a bit enraged by the two usual suspects again) and just didn't feel like blogging either. Am still a bit dissapointed about something someone said and am most definitely not planning to forget it and play nice and pretend all is well and hop in again without being asked. Nope. No way.  I justed hopped over to dm (my fave shop) again to buy some more weekend necessities (now please die laughing: a nice smelling, cooling shower gel, shaving gel, foot peeling) to survive the weekend and beautify me and ran into some idiot from the fraternity I used to spend time at. Argh.  "I haven't seen you around in ages."  Oh, what a loss. Not really. And if you really missed me, you know where I live, idiot.  Other things on my list for this weekend:    clean the kitchen and bathroom;  dust the real room;  paint toe nails and beautify feet to make them sandal pretty again;  sleep lots;  do some washining by hand;  watch the tour; and  stay relaxed and cool (not that I know how. I am already wearing nothing but a skimpy dress and literally melting away).    Sounds good to me. Maybe more later.  Typing is enough to make me break out in a sweat. Argh.

      Considering how shitty I feel in general today and considering this was the first day in weeks, really, that I cried for real ("real" meaning: not because of Lance wearing the meillot jaune), it's quite impressive how much the phone calls with Ev have helped.  I am very impressed by us and how well we communicate these days. By the fact I can finally tell him when things go wrong. By finally feeling that yes, he loves me even when I am curled up in a fetal position and crying and looking shitty and feeling like the greatest loser in the whole wide world. I love him. Very very much. And am very happy that he is in my life. And there to help.  Somehow, last year, I never felt good about telling him exactly how I felt. And when I did, he hence didn't take it seriously at all (something which he apologized again today) and never realised how bad I really was. It's different now. Sure, it was not easy to say "I feel that things are getting worse again", but it was far far easier than last year. Not just because we just are generally *better* together these days, but maybe also because he's doing psychiatry. And knows about the medical side, too, and can support me here. I think he worries about me relapsing as much as I do. Relapsing as in being close to suicide again, I mean.  I really am scared about a relapse. And I feel it coming on, in a way. I haven't been living healthily lately, really. Being so lonely, I mean. It isn't good, but being around others is harder.  Discussing yesterday evening with Dr.K. this morn was good, even though it made me very sad. He thinks (and I have to agree with him, I think), that the fact yesterday evening was good for me, that I impressed people and had an enjoyable evening and heard that I did a good job and received praise was the reason why I needed to bash myself and tell myself I sucked (and am ugly, talk too much, am too loud, too...whatever, the usual) afterwards. Because taking praise is something I can not do. At all. I think it's a preventative measure, actually. Being told I was too loud or whatever else would be even worse than the horrible self-bashing I do to myself instead.  I am very bad at taking critique. And even a probably well meant statement that I have worked enough and should someone else do the rest is a big mighty big blow to my ego. Yay. My fragile little ego.  In any way, I will need to keep an eye on myself. The last thing I want to do is get back on meds (even though Ev thinks - and is probably right - that the meds I were on weren't a good idea to start with). I felt like a Zombie. Those 8 weeks last week are a daze. I functioned, I wrote exams, I survived, but I really never ever want to feel like that  again.  Anyway. It's good to have Ev. Good to be able to talk about all this with him, finally. And I know that I can get through this with him, indeed.

      Was a pretty good evening...  The food wasn't spectacular (the Gnocchi just sucked), but the talks were good, and the people interesting. I came home like 20 minutes ago. While I know I impressed a few people, I now feel like I said too much again, tried too hard to profile myself, just tried too hard in general. And that sucks. I hate myself for not being petite and calm and quiet and only talking when asked.  I felt like I silenced everyone again.  Argh. I need sleep.

      Hmph. I should really jump into the shower to get ready for the PP dinner tonight. Gah, this heat and being awake since 5am have turned me into a tired looking stinky slob.  Am quite curious as to what it will be like tonight. At the least I'll get some free food and be annoyed, at best I'll get some free food and some interesting conversation. Let's see whether I can be sparkling tonight. A cooling shower might help.  *yawn*

      A little success to warm my gardener's heart: my long neglected cactus of the  urlLink Mammillaria nivosa  variety has started to bloom!   This morn, while watering all other plants on my balcony, I noticed odd little bulps on him (5, to be exact)...and hell, it really are little blossoms. Lovely. I thought he was destined to die and had given up on him, really, because I re-potted him at a bad time for cacti.  My cactus and I, we have never been good together, really. I bought him last year, thinking about giving him as a pressie to my much hated ex-best friend T. I didn't give him to her, even a cactus of his size (he was very small last year) would have been too much, and too friendly. So I kept him, never cared about him much, hardly watered him, hardly talked to him.  A few weeks ago, when I bought the lavender for my balcony and repotted all plants, including the Gerbera daisies, I thought - what the heck, let's put him into some more soil, give him a bigger pot and keep him outside, in the sun. And hell: he has grown tons since then. He has gotten more "snowy white wool between his tubercles". And now blossoms.  He seems to love me. :)  The poor chap seems to be a bit confused though:   urlLink Mammilliaria Nivosa are supposed to bloom in early spring . *lol*

      I went to the gym, btw, this morn. And was majorly annoyed. Wanted to take the Yoga class at 11am, turned up kinda early but not early enough to hop on a machine (anything under 15 minutes isn't worth it, I think), so I sat and waited and read about heart rate monitors. The previous class went on a little longer, and Surya, the Yoga instructor turned up late, too, - and there was no one else there but me. Which meant that there was no class. Which was annoying.  And then Surya annoyed me some more. It's just *not* appropriate for her to use the Gym to sell odd pseudo-medical material through her pyramid scheme thing. It really makes me very uncomfy that she brings that stuff up again and again and I really wonder whether I shouldn't just tell someone at the help desk. And avoid her class. It would be a big loss though. I like the Yoga. Even though Surya sucks as an instructor because she just comes across as someone trying to sell somehing. And just isn't very sympathetic. Hmph. I am usually very assertive and can get rid of people who annoy me, but with someone being in a teaching position (even if it's just Yoga), it just gets migthy uncomfy and I can not say *no* that easily. Aargh.  I really was annoyed. Basically hung out at the gym for 45 minutes not doing anything but waiting and being annoyed by the sucky instructor, until she let go off me and I could hurry on the cross trainer (where I burnt a good 500 kcal in 40 minutes at a nice medium heart rate) and then on to the spinning bike for some 25 or so minutes, listening to my old  urlLink Nationalgalerie  "Indiana" tape, feeling like in 1994 (or 95?). Such good music, that reminded me of being at the pool in B. during Summercamps and of  urlLink Thorsten . I really love the Spinning Bikes, these days, btw. Since I found the right adjustment, my bum and privys don't hurt anymore, and goodness, that thing really gives a good workout, even though one apparently moves less than on the cross trainer. I was really just a sweaty heap once I was done, really. Finished up with crunches and some stretching and was a little less annoyed. Even though the "time at the gym" vs. "actual work out" ratio just sucked. In the futuer I should head to the Fitness Mix hour in the morn, and if Yoga is on, do Yoga afterwards. But I will *not* head to the gym just for Yoga. Nope. Nope. Nope. So glad I ended up bringing my shoes this morn. If I hadn't, I couldn't have done anything today.  Hmph.  I feel good today, bodywise, btw. My arms are starting to look better again. And my bum, too. Am pondering whether I should go to the sucky Bodystyling class by Marcus again tomorrow. A last chance for him maybe? If he does the exact same stuff as the two times before, it might be the last class by him that I go to though. Should prolly give Tina and ring and ask whether she wants to come along. Which I doubt. Enough body-talk though. I should go work on my little new project that is to be revealed soonish.

      It's rest day at the tour. And I miss my daily dose of cycling. So bear with me as I suffer from withdrawal.   urlLink I'd love to do this next year.....  just as a warm up to my goal of riding up  urlLink Mount Ventoux  one fine day.   urlLink Surprise, Surprise: I can not afford a tour team!  Not even a cute & cheap little domestique (starts at about 50.000$), hell, I can't even afford a heart rate monitor!  *lol* Speaking of heart rate monitors: I think I want either the  urlLink M52  or the slightly cheaper and more basic (and probably good enough)  urlLink M22  by  urlLink Polar . Very cute features, btw:   "And if being able to see real results isn't enough to keep you inspired, then the  Exercise Reminder  of the Polar M21 and M22 will automatically remind you three days after your last exercise session with gentle text messages telling you to "Move your body!" or to "Get up and go!".   On a general cycling note: The  urlLink Coverage of the TdF by the Austin-American Statesman , btw, is really well done, and has great info for cycling newbies. - They explain bike lingo, riding tactics, the tour in general, all as a tribute to their local boy, Lance. Way to go, me thinks, and the only way to really promote cycling in the-non-cycling-interested-US. Quite entertaining and a nice twist is the tour diary by statesman staff member Suzanne Halliburton who's fighting her way covering her first(?) TdF. The usual drama of getting lost, car trouble and frantic cycling fans.  And while you follow me through TdF withdrawal, check out the  urlLink latest report by Patrick Merle  about which three images will be remembered about the Tdf2001. I agree wholeheartedly, and hope that nothing horrible will happen these next few days that might change those three images.

      Don't have much to say about the day, really. It was nice and slow and warm.  I slept for a chunk of the afternoon and watched the tour, rather sleepily. It was a nice, if not too exciting stage -  urlLink Lance   is leading quite comfortably by 5 minutes and coming in at the exact same time as Ullrich. Didn't open the door when Britta rang at my door (and stood in the backyard). I really couldn't be bothered. I just can not stand her at the moment. At all. Should give her a call sometime at the beginning of the week. Just not now.  Anyway. The day just passed, and was quite nice the way it was. If slow. Re-opened the boards, and thankfully, postings have been very slow so far, too. Wonder when  urlLink Heather  will be back, missed her these past few days and hope she had a blast in NYC. Am jealous she prolly got to shoot with James from  urlLink Nawa Shibari . Sigh.  Oh well.  Had a lovely little phoen call with Ev, fresh from Sydney. He seemed very tired and slightly drained for he had soem odd argument with Jill while there, and they didn't resolve it. Gah. Happens with Jill easily, you part in tension and a day and a phone call later, all is well again. Anyway. Ev nonetheless seemed to have had a nice time up there, and felt the usual down thing on return to Melbourne; not because of Melbourne, but because of the nice Sydneysiders. Oh well. Talking was nice, and we still are all sweet and good and happy.  My right hip hurts, and I wonder whether it's just from that odd leg lift excercise we did this morn, lying on the step. Hmph. Could be a developing bruise on my hipbone. Which wouldn't be half as bad - proof rather, that I have visible, defined hip bones, *lol*.  In general, I really want to keep this working out thing going as intensely as it is. Right now, the defining thought in my head is:"If I don't get my ass into shape now, I never will". I just have this feeling that now is the time, really, to make a change, and to stick with it this time, too. I managed the complete physical overhaul once before, in 1998, but then came my depression and then the meds and that combo made me sluggish and tired and motivationless and loose the nice shoulders that I had.  I really have this feeling that I can do this. That I can get fitter and feel better and whatever else. I am in better shape than at the beginning of the year already, and these last few weeks have given me lots. But I want more. I can't get the thought out of my head that I want to try cycling for real. Not race cycling, but just good decent cycling to be fit and get around and be in nature, on a light MTB maybe (not the one that I have, I mean). I think as a first step, I'll try to work lots on the spinning bike at the gym, just to see whether I feel good while cycling lots and using it to get fit. And to see whether my bum can handle it, too. In the past, I really suffered after spinning lessons, but with my increased training and the great instructions by Marcus, my technique has gotten better, my hips are steadier and don't wobble and I hence do not bounce around and bruise myself in areas where brusies hurt.  Mom got me  urlLink The Lance Armstrong Performance Program  and it's a good basic read. If very basic. And the translation just sucks, IMHO. I think I shall use the 7 week program in there as a start and try it out on the spinning bike. Even though that sure means I can not work with distances and gears, but just with resistance, time, heartbeat and cadence. Which reminds me that I need a heart monitor. Have wanted one for years - I know for a fact that I often work with too much pressure. Hmph. I should prolly go and see whether I can find a nice, not too expensive one at the gym. - And should rent some to try out what I need. Anyway.  I really want to be serious about this. I need to be serious about it. It's my life, and my body and my health and my wellbeing.  Enough dramatic quotes for the day. Time for bed, I think.

      What has happened and is happening in Genoa, btw, leaves me speechless.  I am no fan of these kinds of protests, really and find the whole thing behind these kinds of protests -  protest against whatever you want to protest against  - childish and ridiculous. I do understand and support some of the causes that the peaceful protesters want to shed some light on (debt relief for the third world and all), but really: violence is NEVER a way to bring you point across. Never ever.  So while I do not agree with the protests and the violence that accompanied them at all, the death of 23 year old Carlo Guiliani makes me incredible angry.   urlLink CNN on the matter:    "The Italian Ministry said Giuliani was shot twice in the head in an act of self defence. It promised to release results of an investigation into the killing on Monday.  The policeman who shot Guiliani has been charged with homicide. The charge is a preliminary measure under Italian law that will allow prosecutors to investigate and establish the intent of the shooting, Vinci reported.  "This is not a murder charge against the policeman, who police say shot the protester in self defence," he said.   So I happen to know some criminal law (which is very similar all over continental Europe). And I've seen  urlLink this photo here , that shows Guiliani before he was shot (photo via  urlLink nonharmful ).  So let me share some thoughts here:  Self-defense is the defense that is needed to counter the unlawful attack against yourself or someone else. From what it looks like, what Giuliani did was an unlawful attack (for there were no reasons for justification of his attack of the police car with a fire extinguisher), so self-defense against that attack with the fire extinguisher was okay. The action of self-defense (what the police man did), however, needs to be necessary, imperative and knowingly in self-defense. It can only be against the attacker. The action of self-defense also has to be suitable to counter the attack. All self-sefense that can put an end to the attack is suitable. The real question here is: was the action of self-defense in the form that it took place necessary?  In theory, you can use any thing you have at hand to counter an attack that you suddenly face. One does not have to take a possibly less effective method (i.e. when I have a knife and my hands, I can use the knife). However, even when I have a gun at hand - just like the policeman had, I can still choose between several options: I can decide:  Where do I shoot?   In German law, a shot warning shot, followed by a shot in the feet or other extremities is *always* regarded as effective to counter an attack. The shot in the head of an attacker should be the final resort, if all else has failed. It should be  ultima ratio .  When I now look at that situation, the protestor with the the fire extinguisher, and the policeman with the gun in the armoured vehicle, I just do not see that the policeman used an action of defense that was the least intrusive.  Two shots in the head.  Why didn't the police maze him? Or if the policeman had to shoot, why not shoot into the legs or arms? Why the head? Twice?  Looks like over-reaction to me. And not like self-defense. At all.

      Haven't had much to blog or write about these past few days, really.  Thursday was pretty unexciting, the highlight of the day was the fact I closed down the  urlLink Scarleteen Boards  (just until Sunday) and that I had a nice big work out at the gym. In honour of Rest Day at the tour, I went to a spinning class, which was great and felt like L'Alpe d'Huez to me. I think I have never sweat that much in my life - big fat drops were rolling down my nose, quite funny. Was very enjoyable, if borderline, really, the air in the smaller room sure sucked. They really need to do something about the air conditioning/ventilation in that room. Yuck.  Yesterday was very busy - spend the morn at Planned Parenthood, working on the website (I just need the new photos, and then I am all done with the preliminiary one), and later went out for lunch with Gerhard at the restaurant where we'll have the big Men's party in October. It was surprisingly good & yummy and most definitely good for the two of us. No tension, but interesting chit-chat instead. Not too shabs, me thinks. Talked with the cook, too, who showed us the room and also made us realise that no one had discussed the details of the party and buffet with him till then. How very sucky. In any way, he seemed cooperative enough. At least something.  Came home around 4ish, feeling a bit sicklish because of the large lunch and hence did not go to my Yoga class but rather lounged in front of the TV and watched the tour. Was better that way, indeed. :)  Slept in today, went shopping, got things from the dry-cleaners and have watched the tour since noon (while painting my toenails in fake rouge-noir), all quite exciting today, indeed. Feel rather tired and loungey, and don't know how I shall spend the rest of the day, really. I might hit the streetparty in front of my house sometime tonight (won't be able to sleep anyway, as loud as they are), but somehow, everyone seems to have left town this weekend. Duh. Might ask Fritz, but I bet he is already busy catching up with his mates.  Oh well. If all else fails, I'll just go to bed early and read a little. Got a little pack from the rents today, with the Lance training book (which reminded me that I indeed finally need a heart rate monitor) and some law texts that I need to sort in. Now have six law packs waiting for me. Hmph, that'll take a few hours, I bet. Should prolly get that done tomorrow at the latest. Don't think I'll hit the gym today, a little too warm now; I think I shall go tomorrow morning instead, and do some bodystyling and spend a while on the spinning bike.  On a sidenote, it's remarkable, how much time I have to spare, btw, when  urlLink the boards  are closed. I mean, I do not spend *that* much time there, but it's at least an hour in the morn, really, being busy with the 1324th pregnancy scare and discussing for the 967th time why spermicidal condoms suck. Gah. There are only that many times one can give the exact same adive again and again.   "Through repetition the magic will be forced to rise."   In any way, almost everyone seems to be suffering from withdrawal, Brianna was looking for some other teen sexuality boards yesterday morn (and we together discovered some  urlLink evil   urlLink places  that make ST look like an inclusive-non-heterosexist-diverse-love-bubble); Beppie was spending time at the  urlLink Ms. boards , looking for a kick from the super feminists.  I currently use  urlLink Bicycling.com's TdF Forum  for procastination purposes, and that board sure is entertaining enough. The whole thing there made me realize again what it's like to be a newbie at an UBB - and what it's like to have relatively little knowledge on something, yet lots of opinions to share.  Anyway. Off to fully concentrate on the last few km of today's stage.  urlLink Lance  just took off and left Jan behind....yet again! :)  I love the tour.

      I feel down today. Just like that.  Can't really pinpoint what caused this, but I feel down and am doubting everything again today. And feel like a loser. Not so good.  Ev noticed while we were talking via icq and called me, and that was very sweet, even though I hardly talked about what was happening in my head, and when I felt that I could start discussing that, he got tired and had to go to bed. But it really didn't matter much, the call in itself helped, even though I still felt like curling up on my bed afterwards, and almost started to cry because I just needed a hug and being held. I hate myself when I get insecure when he mentiones other girls. I should feel assured and safe and loved. - He has made all that effort to come and see ME after all! I wish I could turn down the voices in my head. I hate myself when I am curled up in fetal position. I am not like that. I don't want to be like that. I want to function well.  And be normal and feel good.  I watched the  urlLink mountain time trial  in the afternoon, and that cheered me up a little bit. Lance's performance rocked. I don't know how I will get through tomorrow though: tis a rest day, after all! :) My hunt for the special TdF edition of TOUR magazine was succesful today, finally. It's just 32 pages or so (and much of the info is online somewhere anyway), but still very interesting. And such nice pics, too! Also spent an incredible amount of time in my bathroom in order to relax and make myself smooth and good-smelling. It has worked partly, indeed. But still. Some physical contact would be nice now. Would say so much more than words.  *sigh*  I haven't mentioned yet, that Cordu's dad died yesterday afternoon. It all came rather suddenly, really, he went back into the clinic last week because he felt weak, and they just found him dead on the floor of his room yesterday. My guess is that he simply had a heart attack. At least he didn't suffocate slowly. Feel very sad for Cordu and her family though. Maybe part of my being down today is my incredible anger towards Fabian. He left Cordu alone and didn't go into the room with her when she said goodbye to her dad. Such a coward. He said he was afraid he'd cry. What bullshit.  Oh well. Enough tragic for now. A nice old Buffy episode is on tonight. Looking at David Boreanaz should cheer me up.

Even though I bet the peloton hated the lack of leadership by USPS. Bet after tomorrows time trial and the rest day, they will have forgotten that though....

        you only hide   ~something for kate~   so i keep watch and you keep breaking breaking formation to become someone else and your eyes become corridors where i wander with a candle calling out to you  and you only hide because you know i'll find you  you say you just want to feel the way you used to feel the way you should feel and i wander through the lost city of you  and you only hide because you know i'll find you   Reminds me very much of what I felt like last year. Just that I was the one hiding, wanting to be found. Sometimes, that is.   urlLink Something for Kate  has finally put the  urlLink lyrics  for all their songs back online. And I finally do not just have to guess and make up words from misheard lyrics. :). Joked about just that with Ev today, actually.  We chatted on the phone, and it was relationship comfort at it's best.  We're so happy and close these days, it's shocking. It's peaceful and comforting. What I miss most at the moment, is surrendering and granting him unlimited access to me. It sounds bizarre, really, saying it that way, but I just miss having someone touch me, for his and my pleasure. I miss being touched, and feeling so good that I can let him touch me whenever he wants it.  I miss that the most.  My mind is playing weird tricks with me these days because of a lack of touch, I guess. I can't get  several scenarios out of my head . What it's like to bury my face between his shoulder and neck and smell him. What having him in my mouth is like. What sleeping next to him is like. What he feels like next to me and what I feel like next to him.   I love this man, really. And I would so want to have him here with me right now.

      *yawn*  The weekend was nice. If you do not take the weather into consideration, that is.  In case you get the posibility to watch today's Tour stage on TV where you are ( urlLink le tour.com  has worldwide scedules), use that chance and take a good look at that weather. I felt really sorry for the riders, today was a day when I would have never wanted to be on a bike for 5 hours. No matter what glory would be ahead for me. Standing at the side of the road was icky enough. It was cold. It was wet.  It was still funky though, all in all. Saturday, after we had decided that it was way to late to try to get up into the mountains, Dad and I had a good place about 1000m away from the finish line in downtown Colmar, at a double-curve (just as last year), next to nice and friendly people from all over Europe, basically. It rained on and off while the caravane came through, lots of stuff like last year, still funny though. The funky thing was that when the field finally arrived, it was nicely spread out, and we got 25 minutes of arrival action, with  urlLink Lance Armstrong  and Jan Ullrich both coming in with the pack and a German chap riding for french team Credit Agricole winning the meillot jeune. Great arrival.  Once we were home, after some beers and a little rest, Dad and I went out for dinner. Looked at various restaurants but with it being Saturday night, it was pretty hard to find a place somewhere nice. Ended up at one of the more traditional Restaurants on cathedral square, the food was great (far better than the last time I went there), and the wine was, too, and I got all tipsy and hence started smiling at a frat guy sitting two tables away with one of the fraternities elders. They were from the worst fraternity in town, actually, the most conservative, most radical. They wore the traditional cap and band, and talked loudly enough about frat matters to be easily identified. Had a very entertaining time listening to the chat that guy (strawberryblond, from up north) had with the older man from the fraternity. It's all the same bullshit everywhere, really. The same bullshit, indeed. I really am all fraternity damaged ever since having been with Didi and spending time at that one frat place when I started Uni. Wondered whether they would have talked less loudly if they knew I understood all their code words. Gaaah. It still was fun, on the amount of 1998 Ihringer Fohrenberg Weissherbst trocken I had had. Oh well.  Dad and I went home, where I made the mistake of going online and reading that one post, and got all angry and agitated, but went to "bed" (on ym air matress, dad got the bed) soon afterwards. Dreamt some bizarre things that circled around having sex with Evan and advice giving on the boards. A later dream circled around my parents, my shrink (whose identity as my shrink wasn't disclosed to my rents of course), and me sitting inside a shop window having dinner and someone in front of the window out to kill me. It was horrid, and sleeping on an inflatable matress really isn't all that relaxing to start with. I have been dreaming odd things lately in general anyway. Lots about Bilstein (and summer camp type places) and looking after people. Wonder where that all comes from. Anyway.  Woke up not really refreshed and early this morn, and after a small breakfast here at my place, Dad and I took off to France at around 9:30am or so. Made our way into Fessenheim, a small village near the river rhine (and the lovely location of the Fessenheim nuclear power plant, conveniently located not only on the only almost volcanic active area in Europe, but also closer to more German than French cities) at about 10:30, and realised the caravane was already there (even though it wasn't scheduled until 11:15 or so). So I missed out on getting a yellow bag from Crediz Lyonnaise again. Duh. It was raining quite heavily, and the main street was still quite empty, until a good while later. Stood at a fabulous spot again, with a great view down the main road, and in a slight curve again. Ended up chatting to some people from Canada, and a group of very funky people from Germany who are now headed to Alp 'd Huez (yeah!). Both had a good time, didn't catch anything good from the caravane, but got a cute official T-Shirt from Dad (that will only be worn at the gym though). The tour finally made it's way into Fessenheim at around 12:15 or so, while it was raining cats'n'dogs and the church bells started ringing. Very funky.  Even though it was just about 20km from the start, a group of 14 riders were a good deal in the front already. Quite impressive. The peloton was already about a minute behind those first chaps, and it was SUCH a great scene, just like I imagined. A rush of colour, and all these bikes, and US Postal leading the peloton with Lance being right in the front of it all, too. Hope the pics I took did turn out well. Oh, the excitement. It was all over rather quickly though (just as we had imagined), and we left France quickly, went through Breisach, the first place on the German side of the Rhine and had a look at the Cathedral and some cake and coffee somewhere, before we dropped the rental car off and spent the rest of the afternoon at home. It was raining so much by that point that any sort of activity outside would really have sucked, so we watched the tour (by that time, the 14 guys in the front were 30 - THIRTY- minutes in front of the peloton) and I almost fell asleep on my floor, even though the tour footage was very interesting and cool. In the end, O'Grady won the yellow jersey back and got the green one, too (which will, due to the rules, be worn by first runner up, Erik Zabel though). All cool. Even though it sure is bizarre that the teams let a bunch of chaps break away and get a distance of 30 minutes on a basically flat stage in the first week of the tour. I really am a little worried that the teams in the Peloton took it too easily in assuming that those 14 guys in the front won't be able to get through the upcoming mountain stages and the mountain time trial. We will see, we will see.  I walked Dad to the train station at around 5ish, and our cool little weekend ended. I hope he enjoyed it, too. :) It really was nice, and next year, we should really go and see one of the mountain stages. We really had a nice father-daughter weekend. Good discussions, two great tour stages, nice food and drink.  Now I am all exhausted and tired and freezing and about to head to bed. Prolly after a little eMail to Ev. Will still stay away from the boards, I think though....tomorrow morn with an AAS forum filled to the brim is coming soon enough. Tomorrow shall be spend with Yoga, getting tons of stuff to the laundromat and studying some more. Oh, the excitement of a normal Monday.  Off for today.

      My day with my dad in Colmar, however, was fabulous (decided against being on the mountain for logistical reasons). The tour was fun (as expected), despite the rain. And despite a horrible accident that happened at the end of the day when some idiot ran his car into a group of people and injured four. Horrible.  Anyway. Looking forward to tomorrow. More rain. More men on bikes.  And I will hopefully catch one of the checked red caps that Chochonou throws from the cars in the caravane.

      I had vowed to stay away from the boards for the weekend because my dad is here.  I didn't though. I went there for 5 minutes and read just ONE reply, that made me so angry that I wish I had stayed away. Tis the case of the stupid poster.  That person SUCKS. That person is RUDE. That person posts misinformation. That person thinks (s)he knows everything better. This person just SUCKS.  I hope we can find a reason for a ban. I am fuming, really. FUCKING ANGRY.

      Oh the pleasurable pain after a good Pump session. Surprisingly enough, I am only sore in my arms, shoulders and between my shoulder blades. And it feels great. I'll get the adorable shoulders & arms back  urlLink that I used to have . The shoulders that Ev well in lust with :). Thankfully, my legs feel ok, so I will, without a doubt, be able to handle spinning tonight, not too shabs.  My body, my favourite toy.  Off now to watch the  urlLink Team Time Trial . I love the tour.

      Had 46 minutes of relationship bliss again.  Geez, I like my relationship this way. It's all so good at the moment, really. Had such a nice chat with Ev. It all feels so good really, and I am happy that he is happy and thinks our relationship is a source of strength and happiness for him these days, too. We have perspective. And goodness, that rocks. Not comparable to the bullshit of last year, when everything was simply horrible and I was sick and depressed and we just communicated like hell. I still wonder how we both came out of this together and intact. And I should probably thank "all you need is love", too.  Ev started his psychiatry term this Monday, and talking about this, we realised he never knew how sick I was last year - I had never told him about my suicidal ideas from back then until this weekend, really. Very strange. I just hid it all from him, because it was so embarrassing and because I felt like the greatest looser in the world (and still do, sometimes), and felt that he didn't understand the things that I *did* tell him. That probably explains his reaction back then to me going on meds, too, he simply didn't realise how bad it was.  And woah, I was very sick. I think he only got a glimpse into what it was all like after I had that major breakdown that one night in Melbourne. It's painful to remember that night, because it's like something someone else experienced, not me. I cried for such a long time that night (and so loudly that his brother woke up and asked Ev to look after me), it all hurt so much, everything hurt so much that night and I just felt like my life ended. I can't remember what happened that night that prompted this. Probably some bullshit about our relationship, crappy sex, not having intimacy, me having to beg to cuddle with me for a minute or two. I don't know. We had lots of issues between each other then, the Jen stuff, the him-avoiding-parts-of-the-city-because-of-her stuff, the bullshit from her friends and whatnot, my depression, the family situation and we simply shouldn't have had any sex back then, it just made it all worse. Oh well. It's strange to look back on all this. So long gone.  And goodness, we are so much better as a team now. We really support each other now. And we make each other happy. And that's great, and makes me all sobby and happy. And I think we can handle much more together, too.  *sigh*  So very good.  That much relationship sobbiness for the day. :)  I was lazy today, lazier than I should have been, indeed. Studied a little, but definitely not enough. Watched  urlLink the tour  and tried to find a detailed map of the route (unsuccesfully). Chatted with  urlLink Heather  and got annoyed by posters at the boards. Went to a Pump session this morning, which was great, Julia held it, and we were just two people and laughed a lot and got a good workout. Went to a Bodystyling class held by Markus again last night, and I think that was the last one, really. It was exactly the same routine as last week. Boring. But what can one expect from a man in a one piece lycra jumpsuit? *lol* Just kidding. I don't know, this class just doesn't make me feel very good and as I was lying there fighting with my leg muscles, I felt  hatred for my bod and for me in general coming on, just like last week. And that outweighed the good feeling working out usually gives me. Not too good, I think. I should just go somewhere else instead. This morn, laughing and working out with Julia was such a difference, while I still pushed myself to the edge strenght wise. Hm. In any way, I feel good body wise this week, and think I'll dare to go to a Spinning class tomorrow night. Yay. Haven't done spinning in ages, and some cardio-induced endorphins can only be good for me. - And I don't expect myself to fall from the bike either.  That's really all for the mo. I am sitting here in my clean & dad-proofed flat (not that I had much to hide, really), hiding my twice washed sloppy hair under a ridiculous  urlLink bandana , waiting for Buffy to start, eating choc mini rusks (my supermarket had them for the first time in ages today). All nice, really.  Life can be quite easy sometimes. Indeed.

      While I cry some much less these days then say, a year ago,  urlLink this little project  still touched me. Simple and to the point. (via  urlLink prolific ,  urlLink inthegray )     i cried last weekend. out of happiness & sadness, while on the phone to my boy. it was because of his voice and feeling close to him, and not feeling the 16.409km that are between us - and above all, it was for knowing that we soon won't be seperated by space anymore. and that we have been through so much, that these few more months won't be that hard to conquer.

       urlLink Shut up, Sunday Times.  You suck (and I don't just say that because you won't let me link to the actual article).  Yes, professional cycling is doping ridden. And yes, everyone knows that, at least since 1998. Before that, cyclists had used speed to prep themselves for events, from then on, it was EPO, much more effective, far less decetable.  But hell, get your hands of Lance. Maybe I am a little delusional here because I like him so much, but really I seriously doubt that he'd ever dope. He has been through too much health wise as that he'd be dumb enough to risk everything - his life, basically, by using EPO. EPO, after all, makes people more prone for thrombosis. The higher your heamatocrit, the thicker your blood. This man is happy, for goodness sake, he has a family, he is alive, he is healthy, he is happy. I believe he would never ever do something that would put all this at risk. He has been through too much for that. Same goes for Jan Ullrich (as much as I don't like him), -or anyone from Team Telekom for that matter.  Some people simply have an exceptional body make up that enables them to manage something like pro cycling, like the tour, like surviving cancer.  So shut up, Sunday Times and shut up Eurosport. Why do you keep bashing him? No word about British cyclists, no word about Ulrich. It's all Lance-Lance-Lance. His tests are clean, people, so either be as suspicious of EVERY rider in the tour or give it a break and enjoy the tour instead.

      Had my first ever real Yoga session under good supervision this morning, and goodness, it was fabulous. I still feel so very *aware* of my body, if that makes any sense at all. Lovely. We were just 3 people, and hence all got lots of attention and correction, and that was great. It was odd to let someone touch me for the first time in ages, and be so close to other people, too (did some partnered excercises) but it felt great and made me realize again how essential touch is to feeling good.  In any way, I'll definitely make sure to get to both classes on offer, I really want to keep this up. If one 90 minute session makes me feel like this - what will doing this regularly make me feel like? :)

Everything in my kitchen. The cupboards and all. And now it's squeaky clean. And I am tired.  Tomorrow: Yoga at the gym. Can't wait.  I'll try to be more interesting again then, too.

      2 hours on the phone. *sigh* About as good as it gets at the moment. Ev claimed is was the best he's gotten in recent months. Not that that's too difficult considering he has had just as much partnered sex as me since end of January. :) But it was fab, indeed. I can't wait to make things real again. And not just hear them and have them in my head. Promised him that I won't let him out of this flat for two days or two weeks or whatever at least when he arrives. He of course wondered whether I'd feed him during that tiem frame. *lmao* I still can't believe he has forgiven me my lack of feeding him when he first stayed here. We were just to busy doing other things, and Ev was just starved, the poor boy. And back then, I didn't even realize how important it is for him to eat, and to eat plenty.  Locking him up for two days....When writing this, I keep imagining how I pick him up in Frankfurt, how we take the train ride home. And yes, what will happen then. *sigh* It'll get real, soon enough. So unbelievable. eeeep. And yes, I will not answer the phone. I will not answer the door. I will not leave the house. I want 2 days in sensory heaven, and I should get them, I think. Oh, the built-up.  Great 2 hours today. I really enjoy talking to him. I always have. - If I wouldn't, we wouldn't be together anyway, but these days, it just flows and feels right. And  Mr."I-don't-talk-on-the-phone-for-too-long"  had more and more things to tell. :) It was just very normal and nice, and we discussed tons of things and joked around and it was just good. He noted how much easier it is to talk with me these days, and how much safer I feel with him and in my skin, too, and I guess he's right. Am so much better than around this time last year. And I don't doubt as much these days. The fact he worked so hard to be able to come over this winter and the fact it's all working out (money, job, whatnot) and just... everything ....It's just all good at the moment. I feel safe, as strange as it is. I feel close to him, too.  Must be love, love love.....  And this is not just afterglow talk.  Don't have much more to tell really. Did some shopping this morn, read a little, defreezed and de-contaminated my fridge (it really was disgusting), because yes, "oops I did it again" - I let the strawberries go rot. - I should simply not buy food that I do not plan to eat or can't make myself eat. It really broke my heart, but these days, I just don't eat much. Oh well. My fridge is now pretty empty and clean. At least something.  Watched the prolouge to the TdF, and that was nice enough, even though  urlLink Lance  only came in as 3rd. At least he came in before Ullrich. Only thing I care about. I know, I am weird for actually caring about pro cycling and enjoying it as a spectator sport. The pic that I paint of myself in these lines must appear very weird as a whole: but really, I am as non-consistent in RealLife, too. So why do I like cycling, this doping ridden sport? Me who really doesn't care about spectator sports anyway. I only care about the Tour anyway. All started last year, with the Tour being in town, and seeing the great spectacle that surrounds it. Two days of cycling madness were enough to infect me with the cycling bug. And now the tour is on again, and near here, and I really don't want to miss it. The caravane, the show, the rush of colour that the peloton is when it passes. What fascinates me about the Tour is the sheer distance. 3.500km. The trips through the Alps. The fact that those people get up every morn to ride their bikes again. The fact it's so extreme. The fact it's just such a big thing. I find the technicality fascinating, too. The amount of research that goes into the preparation, the food, the material everything (in some cases into doping, too). Oh well. I just find it fascinating. And next weekend will be grande. My dad will come down here on Saturday morn, we'll get a rental car and drive into the mountains and go out for a posh dinner in Alsace, too. On Sunday, we'll watch the tour again, before he heads home that afternoon. Nice short trip & father/daughter activity. Should be lots of fun.  That's it really for today. Calm. Okay. Only icky thing was that Britta dropped by to annoy the hell out of me. And give me the second negative feedback on the pic on my desktop. I should turn the puter off when someone drops by. She just sucks. And I just do not plan to discuss some things with her. Ever. Like why I like rope bondage. And do not care about her opinion at all.  Ick.

      31°C at the moment.  Despite that, I still went out and moved my bum (and the rest of my bod) at the gym this morning. It wasn't half as bad as on Tuesday, really, I actually think my mood and amount of self-loathing at the gym depends on what I wear, too. Wore tighter shorts today instead of my baggy sweat ones, and that was sure nicer. Not much, but a little at least. Julia held the class, and she's so much better than that Marcus chap who was there on Tuesday. She just motivates better and I felt really good moving myself, even though my huge weak legs still didn't do what I wanted them to do today. Ran into Marcus yesterday afternoon actually, when walking through town with Tina. He asked me whether I was sore. The idiot.  Had a good day yesterday, by the way. Tina hopped by really early, we had wanted to go to one of her virology lectures on AIDS together, so before we went out to Uni (only to find out that the movie they wanted to show wasn't there, thing got cancelled until in two weeks time), we did a little shopping trip. Shopped for a bra for Tina, while I tried on one silicone and one air filled wonderbra. And goodness, that was disgusting. Give me one of those in a cup size ot two too small (they either don't make them in 75D or they were sold out, I don't know what would scare me more, the idea that someone thinks someone with 75D would need a gel filled bra or someone walking around with that bra) and my chest looks like straight out of a Russ Meyer movie. I can scare people with those tits then. It was so bad I almost couldn't show Tina. And that means something. Was still fun though. Also looked for some tops, capris and a bikini, and only ended up buying a cheapo top that makes my shoulders look very beautiful. Looking for a Bikini sucked. Finding a bikini bottom is no biggie. Finding a fitting top is the evil bit. And one that doesn't cost 170 DM, please. If that's impossible, I want small tits, instead. Nice super firm perky little things that need a B Cup. *sigh* All the nice things either made my tits look flat or didn't over enough support, and it just sucked. Yes, I know, I am late shopping for a bikini, but STILL! There must be something out there for my tits and me. Oh well. It just sucked, really. And was a major "try to love your bod the way it is" challenge.  I pretty much like my bod these days. My belly looks nice. My arms and shoulders do (they look gorgeous in my cheapo new top) too, just my legs don't. They are large, they are muscular, they are weak, and they are the shape they are now, no matter if I weight less or more. In addition, my tits are apparently not conforming to standard sizing. *sigh* Oh well, shouldn't let this get to me too much. I am still losing weight after all without really wanting to. And I erally look pretty good, or at least ok. Drenching myself in self tanner yesterday has improved it all, too. It really makes a difference, quite odd.  Have been trying to work out next weekend, i.e. arrange things in regards to my Dad visiting to see the  urlLink Tour de France  again, just like last year. Is a major issue though, because the rents made plans for Friday, which might mean he wouldn't arrive before Saturday, which means our plan of standing, cheering and photographing somewhere on a mountain top (means the peleton is slower, you get to see the drivers longer, you can cheer more specifically - i.e. the waiting for several hours might pay off more) might not work out after all. The stage on Sunday is flat and boring, really, and I think we should just be outside Colmar somewhere and cheer on a street corner and spend the rest of Sunday doing something else. But well, let's see how that works out. Am so excited really, and can't wait for tomorrow's coverage. Yes, I actually think cycling is a cool sport, despite the obvious doping problems. I really wish Lance Armstrong wins again - if he does it right, he might be wearing the meillot jaune next week already. He rocks so much. But then, this year, Ulrich is in far far better shape than last year, so....and I know, if I wear a "go Lance" shirt, I'll be in the minority, considering that Jan Ulrich is from right here and half his village will make it's way across the border next weekend. Anyway.  That much for now. So weird to have a Friday for myself - first time in two months or so, because I am usually at ProFa on Friday. Today is a general day off though for them (office trip). Am off for my weekly appointment with Dr.K in about 90 minutes, wonder whether it will be as funny as last week.  Tried to call Ev, but his mom took the call and said he was out watching the footie with Gareth and Kirsty, and that sure is nice. She sounded all relaxed and happy. Good to hear they had a nice holiday.  More later.

       "I remembered you on trains so now you are on every train I hear"   "old pictures"  urlLink ~something for kate~    Last night, sitting on the tram, going home from the gym, I realised how much in this town already reminds me of Ev, and how much I miss him around, how much I wish I could share the everyday things with him. And how excited I am that we will be sharing the everyday stuff at the end of the year.  I remember how we talked about all this last year, a few days after I arrived in Melbourne. How strange it was that everything was new for me, everything that was so normal and so full of memories for him. Driving along a certain street meant for him driving past the place where Jen used to work, past his school, past his docs office. For me it meant: driving along a street in Essendon, noticing how different yet familiar things look. Not more. No memories. It was bizarre for him, because everything was fresh and new for me and had no meaning and no memory. He had never realised that it must have been like that for me over here.  Sure, today, I have lots of location memories of Melbourne. Tons. I will probably always remember that horrible argument we had walking to the tram through Uni. Sitting at Uni, under this odd roof, I will always remember sitting there with Jill, having Fish'n'chips on the day that the kids went home. Being at the MJG will always be being there for the first time with Grant, having a beer and a nasty & yummy "Four'n Twenty" pie. Collins street will always be work at FAL. Lunch breaks alone or with Shail and Rosemary and Julien. It's strange that I have so many Melbourne memories without Ev. But probably good. That town is mine, at least partly. :)  So I realised I see Ev here, so far away from him. So many things here are connected to him. Last night, being on the tram going over the train station, I remembered how I picked him up there that Wednesday night when he returned from Munich. How excited I was to have him back. Dinner was waiting at home. We had a great night, wine, food, great sex. It was so normal, to pick him up at the train station. And I remembered it, and the pain of missing him was all mixed with knowing I will have normalcy in a few months. And it was a strange mix of pain and pleasure and excitement. In my mind, I see pictures as to how we will organise our lives together, and I wonder whether I am any close to what it will really be like. I am so much looking forward to it, I can't tell you. It will be normal. We will both be working. We will go to the gym together. Sleep next to each other. And it will all be good and normal. It will be a test of some sorts, probably, but I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to it.  *sigh*  During my birthday picknick, looking at the gondola going up the Schauinsland, all I could think about was what happened in there. :) It made me smile.   Indeed, I remember Ev on trains. I remember all our trains, I see him sitting in that dark compartment when we first came down to Freiburg this year. I remember him on the ICE to Berlin. I remember him on the train we took last year on our way home from camp, when we had sex, finishing just in time for the conductor to come in. I remember him on the train to the airport. On the train that I hopped on just as he took off with his plane. I remember him when the train stops in Frankfurt at the airport. I remember him on trains. Not only on trains, but on trains nonetheless.  I remember him by the little things. Ordering a Schokomouse always makes me think of him. Saying it's a Schokorat does even more so. I miss him so much, I can't tell you.  I can't wait to add more memories to all these. And to not miss him for a few weeks. So good to know that this time is coming, indeed.

      I have the worst headache imaginable. Argh. Have already popped some Aspirin and have eaten something and had a few litres of water, too, but it hasn't really helped yet. *sigh*  Spent the entire morning standing on Freiburg's blue bridge (it's a cycle bridge over some railway lines and one of the main ways of getting into the city from the west if you're not in a car), where we had the photo session for ProFa. The photographer was excellent. Seriously. The Polaroids of the group shoot and of Susan rocked, and the guy really knew what he was doing. Took ages though, 3 hours total or so, for a group pic, pics of all the various teams, and portraits of the main people. And me. *lol* I was the only one from the interns and volunteers to get a portrait. Yeah. Sabine thought it would be nice to have a good pic of the webmistress on the website. Yeah. - And well, the interns leave in the next few weeks. And Gerhard didn't stay around long enough either. Oh well. The sligthly annoying thing was that some people (the same as usual) quite obviously didn't realise that hey, pictures of the team on the website are serious business, and should be presentable. How stupid does it look if everyone is dressed relaxed but tidy and professional, -apart from one of the therapists who is wearing shorts? Goodness. Some of them really think the 70's still aren't over. Oh well. Waiting in the sun, I had a lovely chat with Susi, who is just lovely. Like her very much. Same goes for Anette and Gudrun, with who I get along better now, even though my initial plan of maybe having her as my gyno here in town prolly isn't such a good one. Better not mix a patient-doc relationship into this. And I don't need a new doc that quickly anyway.  Someone I hadn't met (and I admit I have forgotten ehr name already) brought her baby - an 8 month year old girl called Ella. It was so super adorable, really. She was on her mom's arm, holding on to her, and you could just see the total trust on Ella's part. Amazing. So utterly amazing. And really, having a child, looking after another human being, is such a big deal. And such a giant responsibility. I so admire our lovely teen moms at Scarleteen. Aria - I think you rock.  Anyway. Am really curious as to how the pics will come out. The lighting sure was divine, and the steel construction of the bridge gave an excellent background. Oh, the excitement.  In any way, I have a headache now. A bad bad evil headache. *sigh* Should probably try to have a nap, maybe that would help. aaargh.  Yesterday was okay, but I just didn't feel like blogging. Didn't have much to say anyway. Studied a little. Did some shopping. Was amused by Slobodan Milosevics appearance at the tribunal; his  urlLink "that's your problem"  to the reading out of the indictment was hilarious - like an angry child who you've taken all it's toys away from. - He should better get used to the idea that he'll be spending the rest of his life in prison. Went to the Gym yesterday evening, too, and I am starting to feel the results. Had a body-hate day yesterday though, partly because of the Bodystyling class that I took. The class was not too shabs, really , if not very innovative, there were basically all the standard exercises that you can do without equipment (and that I hate so much). My legs just wouldn't participate though; I couldn't even do half of the icky leg lifts that I was supposed to do. My legs are huge. The muscles there are huge, but they still are so fucking weak. I looked at myself in the mirror and just saw flesh.  And more flesh. And I just couldn't stand looking at me. It was horrible, really. Better today. Slightly at least.  Anyway. Don't have much more to say now. Headache. Duh. The highlight of the day will be tonight's Buffy episode, I assume. And afterwards, watching  urlLink "Phatom of lust" . - Just discovered that ProSieben will show the first of Scott's porn movies again tonight as Wednesdays's erotic movie, and that really is a chance that shouldn't be missed, I think. very entertaining. ICQ'ed Steffi those news, too. Bet she'll enjoy it. She never knew about these movies until I told her last week or so. *hehehe* So entertaining. But then, he used to be hot. And if I hadn't been 14, who knows, who knows. But then, probably better that things happened the way they did. I was shocked enough discovering that someone who I had made out with is now doing porn (not that I mind that at all).  More later.

      I just finished watching  urlLink "Gia" with Angelina Jolie  for which I cancelled my gym plans. And goodness, that was a good thing for a TV movie. The story was sad, the film had some very intense scenes. Woah. And above all a  urlLink true story , too.  In any way, there was pretty good acting (apart from some minor character that were just ridiculous) , nice non straight sex scenes for a TV thing, very 90's angle shooting, but above all Angelina. And goodness this woman is hot. These lips! These tits! These eyes!  aaaaaw. :)

      *yawn*  Am tired, just like that, in the middle of the day. Oh well. Haven't been too productive, really, as of yet. Went to the farmer's market early this morning and bought some much needed food, even though I really am not exactly hungry these days. Bought some fresh strawberries and kiwis and bananas and all, in the hope that having healthy things around that I like will make me want to eat. If necessary, I will force myself. I am not going to let the strawberries rot again. That was just too disgusting.  It's all pretty bizarre, really, this eating thing at the mo. I think I really am losing weight just like that. A little frightening almost. Sure, I go to the gym and all, but *this*? All very odd. Because I do not weight myself, I don't know how much I've lost, but most of my clothes are getting very loose these days, even my usually rather tight Jeans. Hmph. I am definitely not whining about that, but I just wonder whether something other than just eating less, moving more & summer could be behind this sudden change.  I actually think it is good I never did end up doing med, really, i read up a little in regards to bruising easily, and what I read sure wasn't good. Team that up, btw, with the weight loss, and you can choose between a diagnosis of various cancers and lupus, among other things.  Oh well. We'll see. Because of the bruising, and on Heather's advice, I  want to be more diligent in regards to taking my supplements and getting an extra dose of vitamin C and staying hydrated. Because that ruising thing could simply be a sign of a lack of vitamin C, E and K and of being dehydrated. If I don't notice a change in the next two weeks or so, I'll have to go and have it checked out by my doc.  Well, what else is there....ah, yes. I went out for coffee with Britta yesterday afternoon, which was just as expected...rather...odd. Or unexciting. Or whatever. Just not the greatest thing in the world. But still okay. Johannes called her again (how shocking!) on Saturday, and she kept the call short and sweet and plans on calling him sometime this week. We had a piece of cake at Kaffeehaus and then went on a little stroll and window shopping tour and it was okay, really. Mostly talked about her. There really isn't anything about me that I want to share with her at the moment anyway. I sound horrible, sorry.  I feel a little odd about this Johannes thing, too. I kept bashing him and telling Britta why I think he wouldn't be a good partner for her (too young, too immature, what have you - I really don't think they would be good together); while at the same time, I do think he is a generally nice guy, just not for her. I am not thinking "for me", either; but hey, a 23 year old 2nd semester english/history major who falls to his knees and kisses my feet because I listened to Sisters of Mercy when I was 13, needs some growing up to do, and is not really a guy for Britta, whose wildest CD in her collection is the soundtrack to "City of Angels". Oh, I am evil. I need something to fight all that bitchiness inside me. I bet tonights Pump session will help with this.  I realised I let lots of it out  urlLink at the boards , too over the past 48 hours or so; which I really simply shouldn't do. But it's pretty hard at the moment, really, when apparently all the kids are sitting at home so bored to death that they feel the need to fake pregnancy scares at online boards. All new users that we seem to get are arrogant, dumb, rude, heterosexist or shallow. Or absolutely condescending in their pseudo-intellectual all knowing views on Polyamory, intergenerational dating or whatever else.  Can I scream for a minute, please? Thanks.  AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!  That was relieving. If I get another  "what can my boyfriend eat so that his ejaculate tastes better?" "we did xyz - am I now pregnant?"  or one more  "I am really 13 and pregnant, and sorry for lying earlier" , I will  go insane. Promise. Stand by to watch the show.  On a happier note, I can't tell you how much my balcony rocks at the mo. My geraniums have almost fully recovered (both are just starting to bloom again),my gerbera is blooming, the odd plant that I don't know the name off is loving it's new pot and I swear has doubled in size since it got the new pot last week and the lobelias and alyssums are absolutely spilling out of their containers. All that nicely set off by the lovely newly painted red and my colourful windbag and what have you.  Did a sun salutation again this morn on the balcony, in the sun, and the smell from the alyssum was so intense. It really smells like honey. Unfortunately, the smell attracts an abundance of tiny little flies, too, that really don't harm anyone, but they are still kind of annoying. This morn, at the market, I was determined to not buy any plants, but of course I failed. I bought a lavender, even though the time is actually over for it, I really couldn't help myself. The plant is supposed to last longer anyway, so...I should be fine. It just smelled divine, really, like my grandma. Like holidays in Provence. Whatever. Bought a purty terracotta pot, too, and now I can see it here from my desk and am all happy and content with it. Lovely plant.  On a sadder note, I can see over to Fritz's flat from here and know life here in this flat will never be the same. He isn't my neighbiour anymore, at least not full-time. Fritz started his new job in S-town today, 200km away. He'll still keep his flat for a while, he'll in fact be back as soon as next weekend, but life without him as the world's greatest neighbour will be different. Who shall get my spare key now? Who can look after my plants when I am on the road? I really have no idea. He called me last night, to ask me to check his mail every now and then, and sounded all sad and scared. No wonder, he never lived somewhere but here (if you disregard his time in Vienna, but that were only 3 months). He's such as hometown boy, I hope he'll manage to get used to living in S-town.  On another note, my plan to go to Erlangen to see Xan and his theatre group perform prolly won't work out. Haven't heard anything from him as of now (and the Premiere should be tomorrow or Wednesday, as far as I know), and to be honest, just don't have the funds for a quickie trip halfway through the country just to see a theatre play either. Bummer. I hope I can somehow get hold of him and get him to visit me here. We shall see.  In any way, that much for the mo. Should prolly do some studying now. *sigh*

        Sidenote :   Reading Bret Easton Ellis's latest book  urlLink "Glamorama"  for the second time the other week, has given me this really odd relationship to celeb pics. Almost bizarre.  Looking at that pic of Brad Pitt and his much-hated wifey thing sitting at the armani shows in milan at  urlLink supermodels are lonelier , I keep thinking:   "Yes, using these people as terrorists would be the best. No one would suspect it."    My second, more elaborate thought on the same note is:   "Maybe these aren't Brad and his annoying wifey thing, maybe this photo is fake, maybe they are actually all high on drugs somewhere hidden away, depositing Prada bags with explosives in the paris metro, unable to get out of the model/actor/VIP terrorist system because they are "everwhere" anyway and no one misses them, because they are on the front of the tabloids."    What a damn good book that is, really.

      Yup, I am still alive, despite this recent absence.  Am visiting the parentals, something that feels way to much like trying to get away from life in general and am feeling rather shitty overall. I had somehow hoped I would feel better. But well, I don't. At all.  Have been working my little bum off carrying tons of school books and am tired and headachy and pissed off by life and would really love to just give up somehow and not be responsible for anything or anyone, including me.  Oh, life.  More on the weekend, when I hopefully get some computer time without anyone constantly looking over my shoulder.

      In another effort to lift my mood, I started my search for some more info to prepare my ride up Mont Ventoux late next year. Trying to plan the impossible, basically.  Have finally started looking at the logistical side of things  (take someone with me? if so, who? stay where? stay how long? - The only thing I am sure about is that I'll go in september, off season, less tourists, less heat) , which shouldn't be underestimated, even though that stuff is marginal if I look at the physical side of things.  I have no idea how I can make it.  Apart from needing a new bike, I need to loose a good amount of weight (15kgs or whatnot), as there is no way I'll carry all what's on my hips at the moment up on that mountain (or all the mountain's that I'll do in preparation of it). No way at all. I guess it'll all sort itself out over the months as I get into work-out and training mode (and spend all of my free-time on a bike), but right now, it all looks like a mountain even higher than Ventoux itself.  The more that I look into all the details of this grandiose plan, the more jittery and frightened I get. I think I have gone insane, plainly speaking. Just take a look at the pictures and reports of people who've already done it, like  urlLink Inge Johannessen from Norway ,  urlLink Toivo Lagerweij and Marjolijn Kieft, two of the makers of eurocols.com  (a fab personal site on Cols all over Europe),  urlLink Alex, the maker of this excellent dutch website on Ventoux  (could someone please translate the entire site for me?) and  urlLink Gerry from London . If you still haven't realised what a giant thing that is, check out this great site on the mountain  urlLink Mont Ventoux: géant provencal .  I am insanely jealous, and insanely motivated, too. And a little shocked: there is ONE thing I am motivated for!  But I wonder: Why in all the world do I want to ride THAT mountain? For what purpose? I really am not completely sure. Fighting my demons, I guess. Accomplishing  something obvious . Standing above the world. At least, I already have an awful lot of respect for that mountain. Otherwise, this would be even more insane than it is anyway.

      Some random HarryPotter things, just because I need some cheering up:  Ever wondered to which house  urlLink the Sorting Hat  would put you? You can know now, and this sorting hat is a lot nicer than the one at the  urlLink official site . I'm a Hufflepuff, and that's something I can live with pretty well. We can't all be in Gryffindor. ;)  (via  urlLink Sabrina  who not only found her driver's license yesterday, but also discovered she's a Gryffindor - too bad her partner would be a Slytherin. That's indeed rather scary.)   The first Harry movie, who will premier in London on Sunday  urlLink clocks in at 2 1/2 hours . - Not that I mind. The more film, the better. :) And Kenneth Branagh as Gilderoy Lockhart in movie #2: oh yes, I can imagine that very well!  (via  urlLink Q  who also won't mind 152 minutes of Harry Potter)   The only thing I wonder though, is whether the movie Harry won't be too cute. Daniel Radcliffe looks a lot like the Harry on the US cover of the book...and to be honest, I find that appearance way to cute and innocent and simply not fitting for a lonely kid who's lost his parents as a baby, has fought evil several times in his life and manages to get throught the neglect of his foster family almost without emotinal scarring.  urlLink I prefer the german drawings on the book cover . Way more realistic, I think, and Harry and his mates have aged a lot better on the covers of the four German books than on the US ones. And well, Harry wears  urlLink Doc Marten's  in these drawings. And not for sponsorship purposes, but for style.  Just 22 days to go.

      Went to see Dr.K this morn, for the first time in 3 weeks.  I should have gotten and appointment last week, but had avoided it, and when I finally wanted to call in yesterday to get one, Dr.K had already tried to reach me.   It was a good session, I assume, considering that I finally got all that shit that has been bothering me out of my system, even though that meant that as a result, I used up a whole pack of tissues and just cried.  Do I feel better now? Not yet.  What bothers me a little is that we haven't talked about meds yet, and I really want some loony pills now. - Even if it might be just for the placebo effect. I know all this bullshit can't be blamed on my brain and my neurotransmitters alone, but I am not sure either, whether this is all just the result of some 23 years of being conditioned to make not me, but others happy. I am not convinced that following Dr.K's advice alone would make me feel better at the moment. Deep down inside, I feel that his  advice is propably good advice and that the action plan he recommends is a good one; - but right now, I feel like it would only backfire and make things worse, a lot worse. And quite honestly, I already know that all my worst expectations would be fulfilled anyway. I already know what reaction I will get. So do I need the proof? I don't think so.  Give me some pills so that I can recover, and once I'm a bit better, I'll get to the root of the problem. Just not right now. And not before Ev arrives. I can't do that.    In the meantime:  if anyone owns a magical hat that could make me dissappear -  urlLink send it over . I need it. My big sunglasses are hardly a subsitute.   And to the weather gods:  for goodness sake, could you  please  put an end to this awful heat thing? It's the last day of OCTOBER, for fucking sake. I want a COLD FRONT. Rain. 10°C maximum.  Come on, it isn't that hard to do.

      Nice prompt from  urlLink Heather  at  urlLink her boards yesterday , after she said that she herself was was "fall colours", and there is no doubt about it, if you have gotten a glimpse at the awesome photo of her rolling in the leaves.  So what is  my  season then?  I feel like winter at the moment, and this quite surprises me.  In general, I like all seasons. Spring, with its fresh green leafiness and awakening life. Summer with the heat and the full flowery smells, with sun salutations on my balcony in the early morning and late nigths with parties in the outdoors, or just some sitting on the balcony. Autumn with its awesome colours, the smells and the transition of things. Right now, however, I feel like winter, and I want winter.  Part of my want and need and love for winters comes from the fact that they are connected with seeing my partner. Being located in the north and southern hemisphere, we can only visit each other in the big summer holidays, abandon summer in our home countries and head into winter. The past three winters, 2 on the nothern, one on the southern hemisphere, were spend together, and now -as winter comes closer- his arrival   urlLink comes closer again, too .   Another part of it is because summer and warmth seem to be neverending here in my hometown this year. - It's almost November, yet today we have 20°, sunshine and bright blue skies, and plainly speaking: I have had enough, more than enough. I want to be able to enjoy tea and cookies, wear big fat jumpers, and not feel the urge to go outside.  And a big part of it is that I am going though some rough times emotionally. Spring and Summer are seasons that *want* something from you, that you should spend outside, seasons where you have to be active. Winter lets you hibernate, and be alone, and it's socially tolerated.  So give me some winter now.  For me, winter is a calm season, a resting season, even though December is often so burstling with energy as people stress themselves through the holiday season. In winter, I slow down, I take stock at the end of the year, reflect on what has been and what could have been and sort myself. I get homey, and enjoy the contrast between the freezing outdoors and my cozy little flat or between hectic late christmas shopping and a cozy cafe (such as Cafe Hardenberg in Berlin) where you spend a few hours with Apfelstrudel and various kinds of coffee with various kinds of alcohol and reflective talks.  I need all that locking myself up in winter, the hiding and wearing thick clothes to not let the world get close. I currently long for big fat tutleneck jumpers to hide inside. However, it's a cozy and self-reflective hiding, not a frightened one. After all that being inside, I know I'll get back to my normal (and more active self) with the chance of the new year, with springtime.  And well: I like snow. I like clouded over skies and relative warmth that promise snow. I like the calmness that transcends once it snows, I like the way it covers the world, the way it forces people to slow down and how it makes so many happy and wonder (like my partner), at least for a short while. I like sledging, I like sliding on frozen streets. I like how snow makes the countryside look "otherworldly" and gives you the illusion of a brand new untouched world. Sure, I could do without the icky way snow turns once it gets too warm, or just gets old and grey, especially downtown, but honestly, if I get a few days of nice snow and perfectness and the chance to make some snow angels, I can deal with the slush and the overfrozen streets and falling over when stepping outside my door..  I also like the cold, clear skies and frost. I like the crispness in the air on a very cold morning. I'm well aware that it's a luxury, liking the cold, simply because there is no way you can like the cold, if you don't have a nice warm home to come home to (that always seems too warm the minute you come into the door)  or decent clothing or warm shoes or someone to be there at night next to you in bed. But thankfully, I have these things. For me, a winter isn't a winter until it's been cold enough to enjoy spiced wine at the christmas market here in hometown, under the lights in the trees, when it gets dark early.  I even like the super dark winter days that everyone hates. The picture I have in my head at the moment is of being on the train to Berlin in January this year, of the dead, barren fields of the state of Brandenburg in front of the trainwindow, low hanging greyish clouds, and darknes falling in the middle of the day. It all just looked *right* and the trees white with frost in front of the grey sky where just as pretty as any beach scene in the carribean.  Bu alas, my love for winter isn't unlimited. All my loving for winter would end if I had to move to far north Norway: 5 months in almost complete darkness and cold would be too much even for me. I like winter in the dose that I get here, I like it as a transitional state, a time of reflection, not as a constant state of being.  For now, can I please ask the weather gods for a cold front? One more day with 20°C and I'll feel the need to move into my fridge and make some snowballs out of the ice in my freezer.

       Random bits and pieces:        My momentary housewifey-ness reaches new heights as I use 2500 of my dutifully collected  urlLink Payback  points (the fact that I have collected that many points btw indicates that I shop too much at  urlLink dm ) to get a top of the art steam iron which features among other things, a removable calcium carbonate filter. Yay.   The makers of  urlLink pjur eros bodyglide  and the makers of  urlLink fun factory toys  don't lie when they advise against the use of silicone lubes with silicone toys. I should have trusted their judgement, even though no permanent damage was caused by that chemical reaction on me, nor my gigolo. I just need some decent water based lube, I guess. Want to make me happy? Send me a nice large bottle of  urlLink Astroglide !  Sidenote : I still think places like  urlLink GoodVibrations  and  urlLink The Stockroom  need a wishlist system like that at  urlLink Amazon .   Finally received my ordered fitted black fleece top from  urlLink Land's End , since the red one I wanted in the first place was way too pink and by no means as fire-engine-red as it looked in the catalogue, and way too large in L, too.  Looks lovely now, even though some colour would have been good for my wardrobe, but the shirt is nice and extremely lightweight and thin, but superwarm. Today isn't the greatest day to try on fleece clothing though anyway: It's 20°C and super sunny.   It's rather shocking how well one can live without eating. Not-eating was never my coping strategy and it never seemed like something I could do, as I was always a stress-eater and indulger, but now that's gone. Food has lost it's appeal, which is a great loss. I try to force myself, but that doesn't work too well, as I start feeling  sick way too quickly. All shocking. Need to discuss this with shrink.    Have I told you lately that I love you?  I think I haven't, my dearest online mates, but I do. I had so many great & rewarding (ouch, icky word alarm!) conversations these past few days, that all made me realize how much I missed you while I was gone from the net. I wish I could indeed come to your wedding,   Brianna , and have a cocktail tasting session with the people you listed. I wish I could hang out with you, dearest  Kitto  on an everyday basis, so that we could de-stress each other when our seperated-at-birth partners, or the world in general, are making the world at bit too stressful. I wish I could pay your for the great work that you do on so many fronts,  Heather , so that you could relax some more and do more of the stuff that you enjoy.  Linnie , I wish I could give you the time out you need (and which you hopefully may get now that the semester is over) and make things good for you. I've missed you so much while you were busy and wasn't there for so many things. So make sure you let me know if there is anything I can do for you.  Gummy , I wish you peace of mind, and that all things sort themselves out, somehow.  Danny & Bep  - not much that I wish in connection to you, simply because I know that we will catch up very very soon in Amsterdam. Am very much looking forward to that, believe me! Great that you're all there.   A belated welcome to the new add-ons to my sidebar:     urlLink Mary at Halfmadspinster.com , who wrote in her diary a while back that she found my writing interesting, despite my self-labeling as "blonde and busty" :) and herself writes with great insight about things from dressing up as a jellyfish at a Halloween party to writing mottos on the wall.  "Abandon Mediocrity"  - I should try to live up to that motto myself. - And writing it on a wall seems like a good way to remember it.  A warm welcome to my dear  urlLink Scarleteen  mate  urlLink Beppie , who was finally talked into the online writing thing by some chap close to her heart, and has some excellent observations on US politics already.  Last but not least, a welcome to  urlLink Sabrina aka "DarlingBri" , friend of  urlLink Heather , an ex-pat living in the UK who runs  urlLink SatinSlippers  and is also a soon to be fellow advocate (if she finds her passport, that is), who masterly writes about things ranging from gender and peeing to the connection between sex and a clean household and reclaiming words. Great stuff.    Some recent bouts of insanity and dumbness at  urlLink Scarleteen  have taken their toll on me:  my tolerance level to some kinds of question is rather low these days, and I guess I need to watch my tone a little. Oh dear. Will pass, these phases of fed-upness happen in regular waves.      That much randomness for now. More soon.

      I have walked my  urlLink Mexx  shoes to shreds.  They were never my favourite shoes, as they were always just too...plain (and significantly less in use ever since the arrival of my beloved  urlLink campers ), but they were good, trusty companions for the past 16 months.  They walked through Melbourne, Sydney, Singapore Airport, Berlin, Basel, Unitown and Hometown and tons of other places with me. They were taken off and left alone for a little while on Manly Beach, they took me through museums and exhibitions and shops and supermarkets and to shrink appointments. They walked with me through Uni, spend days at work at the law firm on Collins St, I wore them to nights out on the town, to my volunteer job at  urlLink Profa , to a  urlLink Gomez  &  urlLink Alex Lloyd  concert. They almost went on TV, but even back then the show's stylist deemed them too boring and plain, and I got to wear the stylist's very own super-hot high  urlLink JOOP!  boots, which were so awesome (and worth maybe 6 times what the Mexx shoes were worth), that I almost walked out with them.  But still. They were nice shoes, my plain black stretchy squarey Mexx ones. And now they are as good as dead, make a squeaky sound when you walk in them because their rubber soles, which used to have little squares on them, are walked through and have broken up, all of a sudden.  I'll have to throw them away sooner or later.  But at least I now have a damn good reason to go out and spend some money on some new shoes. And that's never bad. :)

      I sometimes forget how strongly some of my memories are connected to my sense of smell. The worship in my private temple (aka "the bathroom") tonight reminded me though.  Using up some leftover Neutrogena Deep Clean Cream Wash that I had found in my bathroom cabinet (it's the kind of place where such a huge tub can get lost) my mind transferred me into Ev's shower on a weekday morning, to being in there right after Gareth was out of there, trying to hurry up just so that everyone else could get going, too. I remembered what mornings were like over there, how Ev and I would have breakfast together, silent, sharing the paper. Right now, I smell like Shiseido Energizing Fragance, also stuff I hadn't used in months, and which reminds me of Singapore Airport, on my way to Australia. It was 6am or so, hardly anyone was there, and I stood in one of the bathrooms and tried to wash the flight from Frankfurt out of my face, tried to feel more awake an used that fragance.  Sounds all rather profane, I know, memories being connected to smells of beauty products. - But then it's practical, too: On nights when I go out (alone, knowing I'll have to face the horrid world of coupledom), and want to feel close to my toyboy, I just use Jean Paul Gaultier's "Le Male", and his smell surrounds me for the evening. Ev doesn't use it every day....just on special occasions, so I smell like he does on a weekend night, ready to go out, it's a smell that -when he wears it- makes me want to crawl into him and stay with my face on his neck non-stop. *sigh*  It's just like that with smells of places, even though these obviously can't be recreated as easily as by getting out a bottle of perfume or using a certain body lotion. Oddly enough, Ev told me today that when he imagined being here, he thought about me in my tiny little flat and had my flat's distinctive smell in his nose, too. - And he's right, my flat has its own smell, and when I come into the door, it smells like home.  One place I'll always remember for it's smell is the castle where I spend so many of my summers as a teen. That old building has a unique smell that I've never ever smelled anywhere else. - As soon as I enter the courtyard, it's there.   I don't know where exactly that smell comes from. It's a very humid smell in a way, maybe caused by the significantly lower temperature in the courtyard and even more so in the building even in the midst of summer. It's maybe the plants there, too. Or whatever else, I don't know. But I know that sitting in that courtyard, no matter at what time of the year or what time of the day or night, the place is filled with memories, that come flooding to me, even just by the smell.   I remember lots of nights spend up on that stairway in the courtyard, being overly tired and full of emotions or having a few beers and fun, I remember Stephan up there, maybe because of that photo taken up there, one of the few I have of him, which shows him the way he was - smiling. I remember Thorsten, and all the fights we had up there as well as those first exciting kisses, that were free of the anger towards each other that we'd have between us later.  I am actually happy that that smell can't be reproduced too easily, happy that I don't really have to fear I'll enter a building over here that will remind me of the castle. - Would be a bit much. I want to choose when to remember all these things.  But well, these things are all marginal, really. - The best, and most unique smell that I know and that gives me the best feeling in the whole world is that of my boy himself, without JPG's help. The smell that surrounds him when I wake up next to him, the smell of his hair and his skin, what I smell when I am close to him, when I press my nose into the side of his neck. And smelling him, and feeling him, well that  leaves me speechless, and happy, and in awe.  *sigh*

      Had my "chartartic quaterly cleansing madness" today. - Am exhausted now, and jittery, because I haven't eaten enough today; - but also content. Nothing is sticky anymore, all is shiny, and the before and after of my shower would have been worthy of a "Quick'n Brite" infomercial. Yesterday,  I already cleaned up my computer (followed some advice from CHIP magazine: 50 ways to make Windows run faster - and boy, it worked wonders), deleted a ton of programmes and files that I didn't need anymore. Nothing like a fast and clean computer to make me happy. So today, I did the other stuff, even made a tiny little bit of room in my tiny little bathroom cabinet. - Not that I know how I am going to make enough room in there (or my wardrobe for that matter) so that Ev can feel at home here in less than 6 weeks. Looks like I might have to put some stuff into the cellar. Which looks horrid, by the way. Oh. More cleaning up and throwing out to do before I can put anything down there and expect it to be usable once I bring it into my flat again.  I really am not a slob cleansing or tidying up wise (and my days as a clinical "messy" are over, too), but this big cleaning session today was really long overdue. The discouraging thing with cleaning this flat is that it's got a dust problem. A serious dust problem. I blame it on the wall-to-wall carpeting that I bought a little bit too cheaply and the not strong enough vaccum cleaner that I call my own - and this is an old building, too. Oh well.  I am so desperate dust-wise, that I even looked at  urlLink Martha Stewart for advice  (which she didn't have) and am close to buying (or getting as a present) this big way too housewifey-book on housekeeping by Cheryl Mendelson called  Home Comforts: The Art & Science of Keeping House ....but it might be worth a try. And hey, I am the perfect person for episodal obsessive compulsive cleaning of things that you never knew needed cleaning. I have the perfect psychological make-up for that. For the moment, and for lack of a perfect dust killing method, I went berserk with the "Clean & Dust" spray and a microfiber towel, and for the next two days,  it's gonna be ok. Or so I hope.  In any way, my mind is organised now, thanks to all that polishing and washing and dusting, and I'm about to jump into the super-clean shower now to make my body clean and smooth and soft, too.  Life can be easy on days like these, when I don't have to think too much.

      eMail this morn, after a message on my answering machine yesterday:    "Are you impressed? I didn't forget your phone number AND guessed that you were in unitown. Not bad, eh? Maybe there's still hope for me."    One of the reasons why I love the boy.  Evil and doubting as I am, I had indeed started to wonder about the phone number thing (even though I guess it would be almost excusable, just one more time, considering how often I get a new one).

      How in all the world did I manage to forget about  urlLink THIS ?!  Oh, the excitement!  Looks like a good route. - For me, it's gonna be Day 14 and 15, Mount Ventoux (!!), and Les Deux-Alpes (!!), and Day 18 and 19 (final time trial!), as those two stages are reasonably close to here.   I get all jittery just thinking about it: Will I take my bike to Mount Ventoux? Just to say Hi for a first time and to see what I have gotten myself into here? Will I still want to ride up there next autumn when I know what it's like? I am not sure. But well, fresh paint with cheers will make riding up easier for me, too, even a few months after the tour.  :)  Something to look forward to.

      I have developed an aural fixation.  It's the voice of german actor  urlLink Ben Becker . Blame it on my watching of  urlLink Frau2 sucht HappyEnd  twice within one weekend; a movie in which he not only sings (in an effort to promote his own band) but plays a radio dj, and hence with lots of voice fixated things: voice overs, close ups of his mouth close to a mic, slow cigarette lighting.... Blame it on me buying the CD from the movie, featuring two of his songs, and skits from the film, including that awesome first sequence when Becker introduces Tim Hardin's "How can we hang on to a dream", denouncing love.  So Beckers voice, yes. It's very deep. Husky. Used. That voice would make one certain spot next to my spine tickle if someone spoke close to my ear, better yet whispered or commanded with it, would make me fluttery in the stomach and weak in my knees. It's a very powerful voice, very physical in a way, connected with his weird rough looks as a strawberry blonde and his "evil chap" attitude. It's a voice for nighttime, for darkness, for intimacy. Becker doesn't sing, rather speak to an acid-jazz-type music with heavy guitars added into it, with poetic words, some of them invented and changed, yet overly suitable. It's nighttime music, driving music, or music in which dramatic things would happen. And it just hits me completely, the intensity of that music and that voice. Rough and tough and a bit rude, yet sensible - and above all: wanting. His voice transfers all of it. I swear.  I guess I am just a bit vulnerable to aural fixation because having some private and intense and wanting and urgent words being spoken close to my ear would open up a lot inside me. Maybe even awake my dead libido?  So excuse me why I am off to listen to  "Engel wie wir"  on repeat and at top volume. I wish I had some good headphones just so that I could indulge more privately, with that voice closer to my ear.  *sigh*

      Back.  Still in not so good shape. Stayed a day longer, simply because I didn't feel well enough to face the world alone again. Which was not such a good idea, as it raised suspicion about the state of my mental health in my parents, and -not surprisingly- didn't make me feel any better. One more  "Are you sure everything is ok?"  and I'll freak.  I hate their speechlessness. One real caring question would be ok. But all this  not-saying things  and  hinting-at-but-not-saying-it-alound  gets to me. But then, I am just complicated at the moment anyway.  Haven't talked to Ev since Saturday, and got a small eMail on Monday. Tried to call him on Tuesday, reached his sis as he wasn't home, called again a bit later, reached no-one, and then gave up. Its hard to describe it, but I felt like such a hassle. The usual is this: I call him, we talk, I tell him how shitty I feel, he trys to lift my mood. I feel like such a burden for him. I'm always sad and needy and looking for him to make me better, I feel bad because he's the only one who really knows what's going on inside my head. It all just sucks. And then, I also wonder. He knows I called. He knows these are tough weeks for me. So why in all the world doesn't he make an effort to let me know he is there? Why no calls, why no eMails, why nothing? If he cared for me, wouldn't he do  something ? I know I am unfair here, and aggressive, too and a part of me  knows  that he is busy, and that there are probably good reasons why he hasn't got a chance to contact me, and that he cares for me (otherwise, he wouldn't have made the effort of getting the money to come here)...but still. The discontent and the fear (I am not lovable, he doesn't want me, especially not in the shitty state I am in at the moment) are there. they are joined by other worries...why doesn't he ask my opinion about future decisions? Why isn't he there for me, isn't that what relationships are all about, being there for someone? Why doesn't he read this, other people read their partners blogs and journals online, too, doesn't he care to know what I think?  All these are louder than that voice of reason inside my head.  Right now, I just cannot be bothered to contact him. I know it would be the usual conversation, I would tell him that nothing is better, would feel needy and bad. He'd feel helpless and maybe say the same not-so-clever thing as Saturday ( "Wouldn't you be better off with someone closer to you?" ). Afterwards, I'd just sit here and be more sad. Not surprising that I want to avoid that, eh?  So I don't call him, which feels like the total annihilation of our relationship, like declaring that it doesn't work after all, that we should give up trying, because it just isn't right and will never be right, like we should simply save the time and money and effort and do something else. He should go and find another partner, get back with Jen, have an affair with that other german Caro that's currently jumping around in Melbourne, just do as he pleases, - he'd be freed from the burden that I am for him, that sad needy thing at the other end of the phone line so far away. The one who isn't the way that he knows her to be.  I am so scared that I won't be back on track before he arrives in a meagre 48 days. The last time we met when I was at my lowest was just so bad. Sure, there were other things making it all harder for us, like the living situation and Jen, and whatever else, but still. We didn't work while I was on loony pills, I was so zonked out of everything. Our sex life sucked big time. All was evil. If someone would force me to relive some of those weeks, I would choose almost anything over that. There wasn't an us in those weeks.  I try to stand back and distance myself from all this. I know all of this isn't me. These bizarre thougths. I am not like this. This isn't me thinking or me talking. Or me that's making me cry here.  I try to see that it's this fucking imbalance of whatever combination of neurotransmitters in my brain, teamed up with all the insecurities and fear that I learned in the past 23 years. And boy, they are having a great big party together up there in my head. I try to remind myself that there's a real me, somewhere, that I can get it back, that I can be happy again, and have pleasure from good things and study and be normal and function, for goodness sake. That's really all I want. To function. To think clearly and be able to decide things and be a pleasure to have around. Right now, I can't seem to remember what I, what my real personality, is really like. I can't seem to remember whether I was ever happy, or whether that huge smile has always been fake. It feels like that now.  I can't even look at my face. It seems so out of sync, like someone made a puzzle from a picture but put it back together in the wrong way.  I want my life, my personality, my self back.

      Watched  urlLink Frau2 sucht HappyEnd  tonight. The movie before whose premiere in Cologne Ev and the team from Sat1's "all you need is love" surprised me. - The movie Ev and I hence never got to see, because we were hardly in the mood for watching a movie premiere after not-having-seen-each-other-for-a-good-4-months, and evil.people-with-cameras, and four-takes-of-first-time-seeing-again and well, there were TV rights to be signed off. The usual, you know? ;) Somehow we never got to see it while he was here either, - even though I wanted to, wanted to see that Berlin movie in Berlin and all. - But well, my desire to not force my boytoy into something he thought he would hate was bigger though. I love this chap, after all. - And hey, his desire was founded. The "all you need is love" people, as lovely as they were, made Ricky Martin's "Private emotion" the background music to our hug-and-kissing-scene-in-the-cinema, and well, I wasn't wuite sure whether I could trust these people with the selection of a movie after that.  I had postponed watching it alone, too, just because it is "THE" movie. Even yesterday, at the videostore, I pondered whether I wanted to see it, - see it alone, I mean. I also wondered whether it would just be dissapointing and badly made and sickingly sweet or whatnot...Didn't want to destroy any secret fantasy of mine. But I was surprised. It was a decent movie. Real. Made you want to move to Berlin this very moment, made you want to fall in love. Made you long for good music and a soul mate. The moviemakers quite obviously weren't so sure as to how people meet and don't meet online, and how chatting and things work, but well, I forgive them, smply because the cut and the music were too good.  *sigh* Want to see it again. With my boytoy next time, I think. Want the soundtrack, too.  The more I think about it, the more I am actually happy Ev and I didn't see it, back in January, in the first days after his arrival, after that big surprise on TV thing. It wouldn't have been too good for us, I guess. We didn't work those fist few days. A movie like that would have made matters worse.  But next time he's here...hmmm....I think he will have to be gently persuaded (with all necessary means) to watch it. It's lovely.

       Realisation on this  Saturday morning :   Suffering from a fair deal of early morning insomnia isn't all that bad in these wartime days: there are always apparent "breaking news" to wake up to.   Unfortunately, my list of duties for the day is almost completely crossed off already - I wish I had a room to clean up and lots of stuff to throw out, I just think that would be a very good thing for my soul. Cleansing. Or whatever.  In any way: I am getting through somehow. Even though even the cat doesn't want to communicate with me.

      Oh, and another side note:  The money I am carrying home from the shop tonight would be enough to convince Singapore Airlines at Frankfurt Airport to get me on a fligth to Melbourne (or many other places, I might add) immediately.  Hmmmmmmm. Too bad that I will need my family for the rest of my life. Otherwise, I would be very tempted to run off.

      As a side note:  Nothing from Ev since Tuesday, which makes me wonder a bit, but not overly so. I bet he is just usy. Wanted to call him today, but once cats, parents, house, clients, food and Ikea were taken care off, our  "window of calling opportunity"  has closed. Oy.  Need some loving.

      So far: relatively ok. As okay as anything can be these days, I guess.  Spend close to 2 hours soaking in various kinds of jot bubbly or oily water last night, after a boring/stressful train ride which took more than 90 minutes longer than appreciated because someone jumped in front of a train in Bonn main station, read more in the depression book (found things I disagreee with, which is good, at least my judgement isn't totally blinded), my mobile died (and i wonder whether the people from toolsandtoys will be able to contact me now and let me know my order has arrives) and my rents were a bit stressing.  Dropped them off at the train station this morn and told to not dare to come home if they didn't ride a gondola, they have since arrived in Venice and now I got a house and two cats and a bookshop and two cars for myself, and wonder how I shall spend my time in such a way that I won't go insane. Note on family dynamics: catfood was in stock, but no food for me.  My first effort at staying sane this morn was a shopping trip to Ikea, during which I aquired orange, red & pink psychedelic sheets, a striped pillow in a similar colour scheme and that addictive swedish chocolat cake. It helped little. At least I now have new sheets.  In any way, I am here, and alive, and even if early morning insomnia rears her ugly head at me again tonight, I know I have something to do during the day tomorrow: money counting in the shop in the early afternoon, and helping Fabian with his application for a new jb which shall pay him even more. Oh, I am such a useful little member of this family.  More soon.

      My train home leave in just about 40 minutes, and I am still as unexcited about it as yesterday.  Just hopped in at Profa to see whether everyone had recovered from the party and which work would be next on my schedule. Talking to Sabine, I noticed how off my responses are this morning. I feel like there is just a tiny little layer of presonality protecting me from being the little heap of sadness that I was yesterday. Oh well. Maybe that extra layer of Make-up on my face, MAC lipstick in Verve and my big glasses will help me keep the world away from me during the train ride so that I don't have to work on keeping that appearance up.  Tonight, I feel like lying in hot water for an hour and looking after nothing but my outer shell. If no one gives me the feeling of being looked after, I need to provide myself with some good loving vibes. Hand me the aromatherapy bath stuff.  Will post over the weekend, if a little less, simply because I have to drive into shoptown to have some net. You all have a good one. *huggles*  Leaving you with another quote from Andrew Solomon's book, on how depression starts:    "The first thing that goes is happiness.  You cannot gain pleasure from anything. That's famously the cardinal symptom for major depression. But soon other emotions follow  happiness into oblivion: sadness as you had known it, the sadness that seemed to have led you here; your sense of humor; your belief in and capacity for love.  Your mind is leeched until you seem dim-witted even to yourself. If your hair has always been thin, it seems thinner; if you have always had bad skin, it gets worse. You smell sour even to yourself. You lose the ability to trust anyone, to be touched, to grieve.  Eventually, you are simply absent from yourself."

      So. A bit better today.  Codula, my new neighbour, and her friend Dustin hopped over yesterday, after I had a semi-relieving shower in the dark. I was already in PJs and hardly cared about being so slobby. Is that a good sign (aka i think people might like me in checked pants and astriped jumper) or a bad sign (aka i don't care about anything these days)? I don't know. Far more akward was the kicking in of my nawa shibari screensaver. I might wear my depression on my sleeve by being a slob, but my interest in bondage towards people I hardly know? Hmmmm...not really. Anyway, I hope they had a good chat about my screensaver. *lol*

      I've been feeling something creeping up all day. And now it's here, sitting between my shoulder blades making me cramp up, and in the back of my throat bringing me on the dge of throwing up and/or crying.  Caused by the content of what I am reading or the simple fact I am unable to find a comfy position to do so, yet having to read on, I really don't know. Maybe it's just that I've been trying very hard to be upbeat and ok since Sunday, or because Ev didn't reply to yesterdays funny and lighthearted eMail confession, or because avoiding people gets so awfully hard after a while.  I so wish I could reach out, but that would mean I'd have lots of explanations to do, as to why I've been so odd these past, well, months. And I just can't. At all. And I don't really want to, either. I'd want calming, loving company without having to give explanations, oh, and without expectations, too. But well, people do not work that way. So I really shouldn't expect that. Being such a shitty friend, not being there for others, for fucking sake not being able to answer the phone or call someone back, how can I expect anyone to be there for me?  I know going to the parentals to look after the house and cats is the worst I can do now, simply because I am escaping my real life, which (if I had one, that is) would be located here and know that I will (when not looking after the bookshop) spend the weekend predominantly alone and thinking. Which really isn't a good thing to do for me at the moment, at all. At least I'll have two days of real human contact, too. At least something.  I really need help. Better help than I am getting now.

      This is as good as i had hoped (and read everywhere) it would. Am reading slowly, far far slower than usual and literally absorbing this thing, already knowing I will have to read it again. Already shouting that this is a true revelation would be too soon, but Solomon surely knows what he is talking about and a genius at expressing it. And he has gotten me thinking already. And scared, too.  I hope Ev will read this. It might help him understand.

       "Out with these clean-scrubbed, homogenized folks. Bring on the lithe, gangly-limbed, pale-faced, scruffy-haired, big-eyed, wide-lipped, strutting, slouching boys. They often seem to hail from England or Ireland, but that isn't a qualification, though the accent sure doesn't hurt. Bring me the boys who are rough around the edges, but sweet as sugar inside, the boys who paint or play guitar or write with a powerful voice but speak low and softly. Hand over those luscious specimens who are almost what'd be called "pretty boys," if they shaved a little more often, or cut their hair now and then, or didn't know they were bloody perfect in all their gorgeous disorder. Bring me these boys first thing in the morning, when they wake, their eyes full of sleep and their hair a rat's nest. Bring them before they've showered, not after. Bring them with holes in the knees of their jeans and sweaters from the Salvation Army. Bring them to me when they smell a little like last night's beer or tobacco, a little hungover and a little dazed. Always keep them a little hungry, a little seeking, a little dissatisfied, a little restless. Let them stay both innocent and cynical; idealistic but impatient. And deliver them all to me. I'll take VERY good care of them, I promise."    urlLink Heather has a certain thing for scrawny boys.   And oh, I can relate. Read Sunday's entry while it lasts, folks. It's lovely.

      I have to justify why I downloaded an mp3 last night.  Saturday a week ago, while at home, I was on my way to my mom's bookshop in home town, driving in her car, Cecil, and as usually listening to  urlLink BFBS  - British Forces Broadcasting Service, the radio service for the british soldiers stationed in Germany. Tis the best radio station up there, best DJs, best music, and hell, the best thing are their traffic reports: I just LOVE to hear bizarre german autobahn exit names when said by a reporter who doesn't speak german and has a nice thick engish/welsh/irish accent. So adorable. If one thing makes me smile in the morn, it's the traffic report.  In any way, this was Saturday afternoon, and their "Calling Oman" show was on, basically a show with dedications and songs for those serving in exercise "Saif Sareea" in Oman. Usually, the DJ just reads the (often cryptic, often lovey-dovey) dedications out, but that Saturday, the chap doing the show was reporting live from the family center on one of the bases here in Germany, at a get together of the soldier's families, and the relatives were apparently handing round the mic and saying the dedications themselves.  And boy, was that moving.  I sat in my car and listened to wifes trying to sound alright and composed saying  "I love you and miss you"  to their hubbies sitting somewhere in the desert in Oman - but you could hear they were close to tears. There were very small kids saying their  "Hi Daddy! Luv'ya, come back soon!"  and young kids too shy to say anything and babies screaming in the background.  For me, in an odd way, that all got to me. It was all a bit much somehow. I am not a military person, I do not support those air strikes (but don't have any great idea for a non-military solution either) and understand that some people decide for the military as a job. Those husbands and fathers and mothers are there in Oman to simply do their job and they have to carry the risks, yet I couldn't rid myself of knowing that when those men and women left for Oman at the end of August, they didn't know that this wouldn't be a reguar long planned exercise but that they would suddenly find themselves rather close to a major hot spot. - Neither did their families.  I sat in my car and felt with those families just like I felt for those families whose loved ones died in the World Trade Centers, the Pentagon and the plane crash in Pennsylvania, walking through NY putting up posters hoping that their mother, father, brother, daughter, lover was amnesiac and somewhere in a hopsital - as long as they were alive. I felt for them just like I do for the refugees in Afganistan trying to get into Pakistan and for the families of the hijackers who are still deeply in denial and claim that the mossad planned the attacks. I felt fot them like I do for the rescue workes and help personnel and volunteers all over the world, too, from red cross workers setting up refugee camps in Pakistan to the clean up crews in New York to the grief counsellors helping the families.  5 weeks ago, noone could have imagined what the world would be like today. The soldiers in Oman had no idea. Their families didn't. The people on the planes, in the offices didn't. No one did. Those attacks influenced the lives of so many people all over the world, in big and in small ways. They displaced people, they took fathers and mothers and relatives and friends, they sparked hatred against people because they look foreign. I can not forget that a Sihk man was killed because of hid turban.  Hearing the voices of the kids whose dads were in Oman -together with hearing that very same day that a good customer of my mom's is going off with the International Red Cross to the Pakistani border to provide health care for the refugees- made me realize how big and far spread that impact of the attacks has been.  And then the DJ on BFBS played a request by one of the wifes: Richard Marx's  "Right here waiting" .  Yes, kitschy. Yes, the ultimately overplayed, horrible horrible song of way too many LDR couples. Yes, sickening and sweet.  But still. To confess:  Yours truly sat in her mom's car and drove through home town and started swallowing hard and then sobbing at that whole  "oceans apart day after day and I slowly go insane"  thing.  Whythen, you might wonder? I am not quite sure. Maybe out of some odd form of solidarity, maybe simply because I know what being away from someone is like, even if thankfully never in a situation where the one I love was in danger. That crying of mine was odd, bizarre almost, as many reactions, including my own, to all the things that have happened in the past month have been. - At least my crying was not angry or full hatred but mainly sadness. The oddest reaction I have seen was that guy at the baseball stadium memorial service in NY holding a sign saying "enough grieving: let's roll" and thereby asking for retaliatory strikes.  In any way, I downloaded that song last night, just like that.  However, the higher beings of the net must have wanted to save me from the hell that listening to Richard Marx is: the quality of that mp3 is so bad, that in combination with the song in general, it's unbearable to listen to. At least something.  So please, do not worry about my sanity. These are odd times, accept my odd behaviour.

      So. Better now, at least somewhat.  Spend and hour on the phone with Ev, and only really told him what was up at the end. But it helped. Lots. Even though I feel so silly when telling him those ridiculously insecure thoughts, even though I hate this sobbing and being whiny. So glad that he's there. So very glad that he'll soon be here. Not that I believe his mere presence will make everything well, everything go away -being happy is MY responsibility not anyone else's- but there will be someone who listens, someone who is there, someone who grounds me. And that will help immensely. And it won't just be someone: it will be him. And, well, he is the most amazing person I have ever met and I am so glad that he is in my life. Sometimes, I really can not believe that we've met, and that we've been handling this odd relationship so well over these past 2 years. Simply put: I love him. Very much so.  Anyway.  Still haven't worked as much as I had needed to. Am tired, my eyes burn, and I still feel sick. Yeah. Just when I need it.  What a weekend.

      What a lost day. What a lost day indeed.  Didn't get enough of the stuff I needed to get done, done. Surprise? Not really.  I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me.   I hate this whole escapism thing so much about me. And it's so damn hard for me to talk about it, because I find it so embarrassing. Yes. Dr.K can't help me if I don't tell him stuff -and hey, that's what my insurance company pays him for- to listen to my problems and help me sort them out, but this runs way too deep for me to talk about it yet. Yet - hey, in a year of therapy, I should have learned to open up. But still.  I still feel like I am standing still and not developing at all. I still feel personality less. I feel life less. My avoidance of certain types of people has worsened. My locking up is worse than a year ago, too. My being anti-social is, too. And I still don't see a light at the end of the tunnel, really, still don't have some sort of perspective - I still can't paint a mental picture of something that would make me happy, at one point in the future. I still feel that I was far more grown up at 16 than I am now. I bash myself for each and everything. I hate myself.  I sometimes feel like I have so little to live for, so little that's enjoyable. Who would miss me if I were gone?  This is all so teenage. So sickening. So very sickening.  All these thoughts, taken together, make me feel like the whiniest, most horrible person in the whole wide world. Narcisstic, self-absorbed, childish, boring, basking in the perils of her depression, not trying hard enough to start anew and be productive. I feel like I have no right to be this way. Nothing horrible happened to me. I wasn't abused, no one close to me died, nothing evil happened to me, really. Some small things, maybe, some things gone wrong family wise, some things gone wrong with partners, but really: Nothing that would matter in the grand scheme of things, nothing that would justify my whining. But still: I feel like shit. And what makes things worse: I feel like I have no right to feel like shit.  Would some Prozac/Zoloft/Wellbutrin help?  Who knows. I am almost close to giving that a try again - just like every few weeks anyway. Would things be easier then? Would I be able to handle things better?  Hand me the loony pills.  And what can I do to get out of this, out of this flat, out of these feelings? I feel stuck. - But the prospect of actively changing this situation scares me, too. I just do not want to face some things, some people. I want to be invisible, and substract me out of the grand equation.  Oh well, I feel like I am already substracted anyway. I am not here. This isn't me. This ain't happening.

A sex ed intern who isn't sure about where the cervix is? Hear me say puleeeeeeze. Thankfully Susan was quick to teaching him. Oh boy.   In any way, I had a fun morning, really, even though it made me realize how far away I (thankfully) am from teens now. Was all a bit bizarre: was I ever that bad and unbearable, too? I can't put my finger on it, really, on what it is that irritates me so much, the icky clothes, the sticky make-up or just the show-off thing the boys had. Ick.  Oh well, it was fun. Chatted with some of the other people there, which was interesting, and got the idea of writing an article for  urlLink Scarleteen  about  urlLink FLUSS , a queer sex-ed project here in Freiburg, aimed at high schools. Let's see what  urlLink Heather  says to my article idea and what the people who run the programm are like. The chap I talked to today, Alexander, was fab. And FLUSS's work surely sounds great.  I also scored another red plush condom with condom pouch (and lots more condom/sex-ed/HIV-prevention merchandise) from Ralf from  urlLink BZgA . One of the red plush condoms should make a great toy for the  urlLink world's best pug . Hmmm, let's see what she says- Won't send it off without something for her owner though, so it could be a few days before we can witness her reaction. Was a running ad for the crappy PP website again, too. Nice T-Shirt, dumb website. Too bad that I can't keep it. Oh well.

      Let's all be nice to my dear friend  urlLink Heather  and give her a Clix in an effort to stop dumb conservatives from inhabiting clix@diarist.net  Clix her, people, she'll love you for that.

       So I am not dead.   And haven't been abducted by aliens either.   I was simply not in the mood for writing. And had no computer near my hands either.   I guess it was a case of "the mauves" as Armistead Maupin has Cadence Roth put it so nicely in his grand novel  urlLink "Maybe the moon" . The mauves are vaguer then the blues, but just as debilitating.      "If I knew what the problem was, I could fix it, or at least bitch about it long enough to give them names. I feel empty and adrift, I guess, devoid of purpose. The simplest rituals of existence, like shaving my legs or replacing the trash can liner, leave  me racked with the futility of it all. I long for serendipity, but there is simply none to be had. (...) I am a husk of a person, nothing more, a burned-out organism tumbling towards oblivion."     Well, it really isn't all that dramatic, really. I simply spent several weeks at home (the entire month of August, really), and worked my ass off and was depressed, and spent September here in Unitown, just as depressed, but without a phone line....It took the much hated German Telekom just 4 weeks to get me a working line. Thanks.    So here I am again, trying to re-start my online life.  Not a new thing, really: These long breaks have happened before, back when I was at Opendiary. It's just something that I do, either because of outside influences (like being without a phone line), or simply because I don't feel like writing and sharing what is NOT happening in my life. There simply wasn't that much to say. - And somehow, time just flew by. Where did the last month go? I have no idea.  So what did I do these past months? Read lots (in the last month mainly newspapers, obviously, before that -coincidentally- lots on Palestine, some new novels). Work lots at the bookshop. And avoid people. Escapism, really.   Oh well. It really wasn't all that bad. Or was it? I don't know. Or I know, but can't put a name to it.   But in any way: I am back and have a bunch of catching up to do, really. I feel pretty ok at the mo....a bit worried because I've been an anti-social slack and face this mountain of work in the new semester and so many people I've simply avoided. I'm sick, too, the result of a stressful week of preparations for my dad's 60th birthday party (which took place last Tuesday). On the plus side, I've paid off a bunch of bills that really had me sleepless these past months. At least one thing off my mind.   Today was a pretty normal day. I forced myself to sleep for 8 hours last night, got up and went to a session with Dr.K this morn (where I just told him about the birthday party, not that much, really) and later went on condom dispensing duty for ProFa at a sex ed/teen movie event. Was rather funny, actually. Scored a bizarre plush red condom with a bizarre face from a cute chap working for the  urlLink BZgA  and at least got to socialize a bit. I really don't know what is going on with Andre, the new intern at sex ed. It's all a bit bizarre, really, dunno. Out of the blue, he keeps asking odd questions (mentioning "my boyfriend" a bit too often for my liking) and thereby gets me all out of stride. Not many people can do that, even though I gotta admit he had an easy game today, simply because I wasn't feeling too great.  At least I had the last word today, told him that he should simply give me a questionnaire with all his questions tomorrow, I'd answer all his questions then, and in exchange give him the url of this blog, which I promised would make him not want to know me anyway.  We'll see. If he's cool, he'll give me a questionnaire tomorrow, when on another round of condom dispensing duty.   Later caught up with Ev, who's also sick, poor boy. Otherwise, we're doing just fine,  I reckon. Told me today, that he also has someone around him showing interest, but of course Ev - never wanting to hurt *anyone* - is far less blunt than me in saying "no" or telling someone about the fact that he has a partner. The usual. He tells me not to worry, and I don't, even though I hate the fact this is such an issue for him. What bullshit. He should just go around and show and live and tell that we are indeed together. Where's the problem here? There's always a way to let someone know that you're not single. Oh well. In any way: It would be insane to get all worried now, just about 2 months before he arrives here. - It should be bliss, really.   And the rest of the day? - Just the usual. Shopping, cleaning up the computer (which was messed up big time), and catching up with lovely Kitto. - The Catching up part quite obviously will need to continue over the coming days. I haven't had a look at a single of my regular blogs those past weeks....   Anyway. That much for a start. More soonish. Definitely.

       urlLink What's your Pooh-sonality?   Surprise! (no, not really).   " Eeyore :  "I'd look on the bright side. If I could find one."   You're just like Eeyore, who is philosopher of gloom and takes pleasure in seeing the negative side of things. Show him a silver lining and the old grey donkey feels obliged to point to a cloud. But Eeyeore expresses his feelings very touchingly, making him the most popular pessimist of all time, although he doesn't expect anyone to pay attention to him and acts like he would rather be alone, Eeyore really wants to be included in the fun.   He shares his thistles with Tigger, enjoys games of "Pooh Sticks" and is touched when the others remember his birthday. Everyone likes Eeyore, though he doesn't believe it and they find the best way to take his gloomy attitude is by cheerfully ignoring it. "  (via  urlLink wannabe )

      It's been raining steadily all morning. Super soft, very even rain. New Zealand South Island West Coast Rain; Even though it was a "dry" winter, in 1996, and there were hardly any waterfalls in Milford Sound, it rained like that, for three days, while Sylvia and I were in Franz-Josef. This rain reminds me of NZ, and I have to think of that travelling and how much fun it was, and I have to think about Tina and Tim and how glad I would be for her if she had an awesome time in NZ next year with that apparently awesome boy she fell in love with at first sight. I want her to be happy. As happy as she looks on that photo from Spain.  But back from Franz to hometown: the bizarre thing is: these small raindrops are falling very slowly. As if they are training to be snow. Yihaa.   (enough rain mediation for the day)

      Tina and I were browsing Bonds underwear online (to determine what exactly the toyboy - or rather : his sister, would have to buy to smuggle into Europe for both of us), when we stumbled across the follwing advice for  urlLink "Men buying underwear for ladies"  at  urlLink zodee.com.au .    Men Buying For Ladies    The easiest way to determine the size for your ladyfriend is to have a look in her lingerie drawer at the sizes she is currently wearing. This may not always be possible and if the thought of being caught browsing through her lingerie drawer put you off there is another easier method which surprisingly works quite well. Think of her bust as a piece of fruit. The equivalent fruit size matches the cup size you should buy:       Fruit - Cup Size  Lemon - A Cup   Orange - B Cup  Grapefruit - C Cup   Melon - D Cup

      Good day.  Didn't do much law, didn't go to the gym, but had awesome and much needed girl time with Tina instead. Went out and picked out my new mattress; both of us trying it out together, making the guy in the shop think we'd use the it together, too.  Rather entertainin. Delivery will be on Monday, when I will also get the bed bits. All very expensive, but considering I slept in the shittiest bed for the past 4 years, that splurge is justified. And oh, am I looking for building the bed. Let's see whether I can do that! Very exciting. Need to clean out the cellar over the weekend to make space for the old mattress which should stay there, for guests. Shopped for christmas pressies, got Tinas new and very first pill (and boy, was she excited!), ate a super delicious döner kebap, walked through town and were happy overall. Emptied a bottle of champagne at my place, just for the heck of it, and talked for 5 hours straight. Which, yet again, sparks me to say that I am blessed for having such a great, honest, loving pal as her. :) These last few hours indeed brightened it all up, indeed.  Good day, indeed. I want more like these. The chances are good: it's less than 2 weeks to go. Amazing.

      It's yet another day that looks like snow but won't bring any, I overslept by 90 minutes yet again, I still have a giant unwritten to-do list (even though my toyboy informed me that one of his friends would gladly take the job of organising accomodation in Amsterdam from me), haven't checked out the paper instructions yet, there's still that giant pile of clothing on my floor and I still haven't convinced myself that I have to drag my bum to the gym (need to repeat my  "I want to look good naked"  mantra more often, obviously).  No matter what, there still are some entertaining things in this world, and I need to remind myself of them. I usually don't laugh about accidents, but really, while searching for unimportant info, I came up with this CNN newsbit from 1999:  urlLink Bird slams into Fabio's face    "It was a shocking scene as hunky model Fabio stepped off the inaugural run of a roller coaster Tuesday, his nose splattered with blood. But the man seen on dozens of romance book covers proved to be OK after an unfortunate bird apparently collided with Fabio's face sometime during the ride."   Please check out the article for the photo. Please. Fabio must have cheekbones of steel for that doomed bird to die on them without harm to Fabio.  Also, late last night,  urlLink Kitto and I surfed for some porn featuring nude males . We checked out an entire section of a not-to-be-named website, featuring nude men, and well, it was very dissapointing. Nothing about those photos was appealing. Nothing at all. Either the chap looked underage and tore at his foreskin (nothing bad about a foreskin, but please, why tear at it?), or the penile dimensions were simply way too scary, or they had the worst faces, or looked like they spent an hour a day on body hair removal, others were resting their penii on furniture, and almost all featured that horrid  look-here-at-my-package  penis presenting hand thing.  One thing was most disturbing though, and  urlLink Kitto  put it nicely.  "Where did they find these guys? Seriously. And how and why would one tie a penis into a knot? And what do you do with it after you've got it knotted? Is that even physically possible?"   That was actually the most disturbing thing. I am still not convinced as to what these two people did with their penises, tie them in a knot, use strange cockrings, wrap their testicles around their penis from behind or enhance the photos with photoshop. - I thought I had seen it all, but quite obviously, I hadn't. The stuff really was bad and not at all sexy, or hot, or anything really. I guess part of it is the fact Kitto and I are not  really  the target group, I guess: hardly anyone shoots naked males explicitly for women. Part of why it wasn't hot at all was probably the cheapo in your face thing, too. To be honest: The artistic shot of a slim man in lots of autumn leaves where you do *not* see any genitals, but his rather stunning eyes instead and his lovely very real body, is just so much sexier than any of the stuff Kitto and I looked at last night. It's the general "mainstream" porn thing I guess, I just don't find the usual stuff appealing at all, no matter whether it's men or women. Nothing leaves me colder then the standard on the beach Playboy shoot.  Anyway. I do have some sources of good porn, and will continue to enjoy these, and enjoy the occassional photos of the certain beautiful male, indeed.  On a final note, I wasted precious time by reading recaps at  urlLink Mighty Big TV . Oh, I love the opinionated stuff. Especially about  urlLink the episode of "Making the Band" where Ashley leaves his make-up loaden, dumb galpal Shelli . Yes, I think that Making the Band is entertaining . And  urlLink Popstars , too. And even worse, I think I might have developed a fascination for  urlLink "The Pretender" . Please shoot me.  Off to move my bum, I think, and start the paper. Oh, and I might want to think about some eating, too.

      Better today. No whining about my lack of hunger and desire for food today. No depressive bouts of crying today either.  While at the  urlLink gym  today, I read an article in  urlLink Stern , the title story is on Depression. The authour quite obviously recently read  urlLink Andrew Solomon's "The noonday demon" . All rather superficial (if you consider how very in depth "The noonday demon" is), but still a good article, trying to destigmatize this disease. Made me wonder again whether my current thoughts, fears and behaviour would validate the use of anti-depressants again. I somehow still think it would be worth to give it a try. Hmph.  Decided to have an off day today, just to sort some stuff out before I have to get busy. (instructions downloaded last night) and all the preparations for Ev's arrival; even though the latter is, of course, a good thing to prepare for. Need to jot a to-do-list down, but am avoiding that, for fear that once I see it all on paper/in pixel, I'll be too scared to start. *lol* Things to do tomorrow (that would be on that invisible list): finally check out the bed shop; check Amsterdam Hotels for New Years, work out, start paper. Oy.  For tonight, all I'll do is clean up this place a bit and watch Buffy and Angel and be online and surf for some good stuff for Saturdays  urlLink linkandthink  blogging event. We had another ignorant troll at the  urlLink boards  yesterday, some "kid" (not quite sure whether that was a kid, or just  another bored Baptists pastor from Virginia) spreading the word that true love waits is the solution for all problems, and that condoms had holes big enough for HIV to pass through. Yeah. Lovely.  Good thing: Two weeks from now, I will be on my way to Frankfurt Airport. Unbelievable.

       Sick thoughts of the day:   (brought to you by ye olde well known fact that if you got nothing else to lean on to for stability, even mental illness will do)   When I was 14, I would have loved to have the stamina in regards to not eating that I apparently have now. Very bizarre, and quite honestly something that has been worrying me for the past months. When I've been writing that I've been eating crappily, I actually mean hardly.   I was always the bingeing type back when I was in the throws of disordered eating; it was bingeing brought on by super restriction (and the latest fad diets my dear friend Jane thought were great and working), bingeing brought on by stress and pain and loneliness. Now loneliness and stress and fear pretty much bring on starving and the inability to eat, and bingeing really is rare these days (if it happens, it's Knoppers or Oreos and Marshmallow fluff). I seriously can not eat Made some simple pasta last night, and seriously couldn't even eat hal a plate full.  What in all the world is this? My body shutting down? Me subconsciously looking for a new affliction? Wanting to control something while all seems to be slipping out of my hands (not that that's a new feeling at all)? Chronicling and writing this feels so ridiculous to me. I should have more important things to do, more important things to worry about, more important things to think. But alas, these thoughts are here, and I know they are bad, and hurtful and what I am doing is harming me, making my metabolism run amok once I go back to eating.  Really need to make in effort to purchase some almost nutritious food that I can handle eating (and that I can afford, too). Not that I know what that is yet.

Islam, Oil and the New Great Game in Central Asia  and  urlLink Ralf Rothmann - Ein Winter unter Hirschen );  listening to  urlLink something for kate's  beautiful sharks is like a blanket of love and emotion filled memories;  and best of all:  urlLink it's just 15 days to go .

      I'm back, and -not really surprisinly- feeling like shit. I'm just so tired of it all, so completely and utterly exhausted, and somehow it all got worse throughout the day. It's the aftermath of the weekend, I guess. At least I didn't overcompensate as bad as usually this weekend, even though I was, of course, the perfect little daughter anyway. I get so caught up in all of it that I forget what I am like anyway. If only the world could leave me alone for a while. The workload and the stuff I have to organise these next few days is unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable. I have no idea how I should get all of it done. And I just got an eMail from Sabine from Profa asking me to hop in and help her. As if all the work I have to do now isn't enough already. Of course, I let her talk me into helping. Yes, my fault.  I should probably just dig a little hole for myself and hide for a little while.

      Off for the weekend, still in a not too cheery mood, and an hour on the phone with the toyboy helped only slighty. Psychobitch called him to "make up and be friends". aha. I don't believe a fucking thing that person says.  Argh. Things can only get better. Or what was that song by  urlLink D:Ream  in 1992 again?  Have a good one, people.

      I've been having sort of down days again, or whatever. There are things to say, but I neither have the words to express them, nor the time or the feeling to sit down and think about them and type. Have been tired of that thinking, I guess. Am tired overall anyway. Too tired to go to bed and too awake to sleep, or whatever the sentence was. On the other hand I feel like I am constantly sleeping anyway.  Part of it is the upcoming exam and paper and the stress that will mean (considering that I need to get it all done within two weeks - before Ev arrives, and prepare everything for his arrival, two - not easy if you consider how time seems to fly by at the mo), part of it is going home this weekend, too. Cancelled the session with Dr.K scheduled for Friday and was happy that it wasn't him answering the phone so that I didn't have to give a reason for my cancellation yet. I'll have to tell him anyway, but better later than sooner. I don't think going home yet again is a healthy decision at all, I know it isn't, but it's the weak and practical thing to do though.  I should set a goal as to how I want to be this weekend ( like to be me, maybe, just for a change? ), but I already know I will just fall back into the same old role as the perfect little daughter, looking pretty, smiling lots and overcompensating by doing whatever is wanted even before it's being asked all the bloody time. I know I'll be sitting on the train Sunday afternoon and feel shitty and drained and will need a whole day to get over it.  Oh well. I should simply have said no, I didn't want to come and used the time here to get my life back on track. No I agreed to going home, and I can't blame nobody but me.  Duh.  Yet again, I just want to drop everything and fall into the coziness of feeling at home with someone. I sure won't have that this weekend, though, and don't know whether I can get through the next 20 days feeling this way, just to have to deal with the inevitable adjustment period we will have on his arrival. I should lower my expectations, but expecting only good things really is what helps me get through the day at the moment.

      It smells like snow today.  The sky has been low all day today, so low that it's been foggy and the visibility was maybe 150 metres max. Now that it's dark, the sky has this odd snow-promising lightness about it. Yay.  This morn, while I waited for the bus to take me to the gym, some tiny, tiny, shy little snow flakes fell. - Unfortunately only for a little while. I could do with some snow now, for the cozy-glad-to-be-inside-factor. The weather gods still have a few more days though: The last day for my first snow order of the winter is Ev's arrival on December 12th.   urlLink 23 days to go.

      I have been having near orgasmic dreams about him for a few years now. I know all the lyrics to the entire  urlLink "I've been expecting you"  album.  But woah,  urlLink Robbie  has topped it all. Seriously.  Yes. I confess. I am a  urlLink Frank Sinatra  fan. Big time. Have been for ages, since I was 10 to be exact, and found the single  urlLink "Strangers in the night"  somewhere in my rents record collection and played it on my first record player. I liked Frank's music althrough my cheap and poor  late 1980's pop likings (Bros, and then not yet as hot as today Kylie Minogue), through my sinister Sisters of Mercy times, through holding Bob Marley sacred, through liking New Model Army and The Cure, through listening to Rory Gallagher and other retro stuff and and to whoever else - and didn't find it contradictory at all, even though I of course hid my little Sinatra habit in front of my mates. Hey, I was a teen, too.  I bought  urlLink Duets , mainly for the  urlLink Bono  version of  urlLink "I've got you under my skin" , but liked some of the rest, too. I wanted to go to Frank's "Goodbye tour", when was that...in  1993 I think- but the tickets were migthy expensive, so my mother and brother refused to take me with them, mother claiming that Frank would do another goodbye tour....but he didn't. He died in 1998. I've never really forgiven my mother for not wanting to splurge those few DMs on me so that I could see him, even though that concert would have probably disillusioned me: Frank stumbled over the stage, and forgot the lyrics. I still wish I had been there.  When I hit Uni, I suddenly found myself at formals and dances soundtracked with Ol'Blue Eyes music, and me and my then best galpal took a few hours getting dressed for these occassions while consuming Gin Tonics and Gauloise Blondes and listening to Frankie boy. I'll always connect  urlLink "Fly me to the moon" ,  urlLink "What now my love"  and  urlLink "I get a kick out of you"  with these winter nights of ballroom dancing, too much booze, awesome 1950's style dresses from H&M and dark red lipstick. And a certain affair with a certain someone. It sure was a lovely time. Just the kind of time you should have as a freshwoman, I think.  And now  urlLink Robbie , evil, tattooed, hot little Brit Robbie (who I saw  in spring 1992 in a little club in northern England, when the pre-hype Take That were on their first school tour, and who kissed my hostsister who interviewed him for the school paper) is singing Sinatra, and is bloody good at it, too.  He's hot, hot, hot. And I love it. The Robbie Swing Extravaganza concert from Royal Albert Hall is on TV tonight. - I always expected Robbie to be awesome at this thing, ever since I read rumors about him making a swingish album a few months ago. But woah, this is even better than expected.  I'll have a wet dream of Robbie in a Cut singing  urlLink "Come fly with me"  tonight. I swear.  *purrr purrrrrrrr purrrrrrrr*  P.S. In case anyone ever asks you about my funeral proceedings: Yes,  urlLink "My Way" , please. And you can choose whether by Robbie or Frank. Just make it a live version, ok? And play it so loudly that everyone can sing along. That's what everyone does with that song anyway.

      On a lighter and less political note: Preparations for the  urlLink toyboy's arrival  are progressing by the way.  Managed to finally get hold of the awesome lingerie I had ogled for a few weeks (picture to follow soon), and now wonder whether the sizing will be ok (had to send my mother -gasp!- off to buy it at home, as the shop chain over here didn't have itdown here). I hate it when they sell stuff in sets. My chest and hip size aren't necessarily related, and hardly any sets are made to acoomodate my non-standard chest. We'll see. Told the toyboy today that I had shopped for stuff just for his arrival. To which he commented that that wasn't necessary, as lingerie was redundant anyway and would only slow things down. hehe. :)  Preparations for finally getting a bigger bed are also progressing. Checked out the details yesterday: bigger head and feet panels for my bed (to make it wider, obviously), would only be around 190,-DM, which is less than I expected. New slatted frame and mattress will obviously be more expensive, but if you consider that I've been sleeping on the old stuff (that was free, as it was already purchased before I moved 4 years back), the investment would be worth it. Have wanted a wider bed ever since I moved out. - And well, now that Ev and I will have to actually *sleep* a bit, too, and be productive member of society the next day, I really think a bigger bed is in order. A virginal bed to deflower with the toyboy. Sounds great, me thinks.  Am also ogling some things to add to the toybox and to use in the defolarion of that bet. Like the  urlLink KamaSutra Weekender Kit . Yum yum.  Oh, I cannot wait. I cannot wait. eeeeeep.

      Bigger news, if just as enraging as the freeing of the aid workers, was today's  urlLink confidence vote in the German Parliament  though.  Germany is a stable democracy, in the 52 years of it's existence, chancellors only asked for a confidence vote 3 times so far. Once by Willy Brandt in 1972, to ensure support on the "Ostpolitik"; in 1982  by Helmut Schmidt, on his economy politics and again 4 months later by Helmut Kohl to induce early elections, after he succeeded Schmidt when a vote of no confidence to the chancellor, initiated by the opposition, had been successful.  So today was the fourth time ever. - And the first time that a confidence vote was directly connected to a vote on an issue. While the legality of such a move has been disputed in the law community, the general opinion seems to be that it's legal to mix the two things up. - I personally doubt the use of such a move though.  Asking the parliament for the confidence vote is the ultima ratio of the German chancellor: If he has nothing left to loose, he risks his position by trying to force his party or coalition to step back in line. This is what we got to witness today. It was an act of weakness trying to keep a dead coalition together.  Support for sending German military off to join US and British forces is high. Apparently almost 60% of Germans support such a move. - Had the vote today been simply on the issue of deploying troops, all parties, excluding the Greens and the socialist PDS, would have voted almost unanimously for troop deployment and would have represented the public opinion far better. Combining the confidence vote with the decision to deploy troops to one vote however, forced the opposition parties to vote against *both*. It's just natural that opposition parties dos not support a chancellor in a confidence vote. All speakers from CDU and FDP stressed that they supported troop deployment, but not the chancellor. They also stressed the legal pitfalls of the actual proposition and the fact that it was mainly a blank cheque for the US and the fact that it's unclear whether a deployment for a year can be recalled if the political situation ever changes.  We also got to witness a party today, who has sold all it's ideals in the face of power and hence made itself unvotable.  The Greens are a party without a moral core now. If you compare today's Greens to the party they once were, a party that emerged out of the pacifist movement in the late 70's and ealy 80's, a party that tried to be the non-parliamentary opposition inside parliament, you might think that you're looking at a completely different party. The Greens are now just what they never wanted to be: a party clinging to power, that does let got of ideals in order to stay in the country's drivers seat. It was sad to see Green politicians try to justify the sudden change of heart ever since Schröder announced that he'd combine the troop question with a confidence vote. I have no respect left for them, Joschka Fischer being the obvious exception. He seems to be the only one who at least doesn't change his views under pressure.  At least the PDS was true to itself. Yup, they had nothing to loose anyway, but at least they stood by their beliefs. A rare thing in today's politics, I think.  In my opinion, what's been deemed a political success for Schröder by foreign media was not just a sign of weakness, but also an action whose consequences Schröder quite obviously hasn't fully realised. The Greens will lose even more in the elections next year than already expected and he will not only find himself with less votes, but also without a coalition partner. - Unless he manages to convince the FDP, which I highly doubt.  Schröder should have taken a look into the history books - even when a confidence vote was decided in favour of the government, like for Schmidt in 1982, it is no guarantee that a ruling coalition will last much longer. Schmidt's government lasted another 4 months.  Politics of force, politics of the will to stay in power, no matter that it means throwing all your ideal over board, have no future. We saw politics today, were MPs sacrificed their beliefs to the joined opinion and were degraded to cameo roles on what should be their centre stage. It was a low point for our parliamentary democracy; the abuse of a necessary tool for the chancellor. In addition, it didn't make Germany an equal partner with the US in the "war against terrorism", but made this country look like an over-eager yes-saying teen dying to finally been regarded as an adult. It was the continuation of mistakes that started on September 11th, when Schröder announced that Germany would offer unconditional, unquestioning support to the US. Instead of opening a discussion on Germany's future role in the world, he silenced everyone who disagreed as someone not in line against terrorism. Today, Schröder, the SPD and the Greens surrendered to the rule of George W. German politicians will from now on not have a say in what happens with German Soldiers on mission in a target areas not defined not defined as of now, in missions not defined as of now.  The days of this government are counted, I think. A coalition were you break one partners spine to keep him qiet to keep the coalition alive is a coalition that is dead.

      Have been on a bit of a news binge today, for the first time since I stopped watching  urlLink CNN  about 2 weeks after September 11th.  Listened in astonishment to the press conference by the freed  urlLink Shelter Now  aid workers early this morning. Don't get me wrong. I am happy they are all free again, and healthy, and whatever else, I think NGO's usually do a great job in providing help on a local level. - But I would make the Shelter now workers and their organisation pay for the cost of the military mission to get them into Pakistan. Seriously.  If and when you go into a foreign country to help people, you still need to abide to the places rules and laws in order to not endanger yourself or the people you came to help. - Even if the place is Afghanistan, and ruled by a people-hating fascist regime, with laws that are the opposite of what you are used and what you deem ok.  If you go into Afghanistan, you  know  the rules. Or you  should  at least know the rules. You know you can not try to convert people to Christianity, unless you are willing to put your life at risk. While I can understand that you discuss beliefs when you get to know people, I can not grasp, that these aid workers were naive (the first word that came to my mind was actually  dumb ) enough to think that  urlLink using a Children's Bible to teach English, or showing a video on Jesus  were ok and wouldn't endanger them or the Afghan people that they showed the material to.  Unbelievable. Seriously unbelievable.  Those two naive US missionaries sit at that press conference, talk about the lord helping them through this time and that the first thing they did was get a hair cut and make-up, and do not realize that they inflicted this ordeal on themselves. And shouldn't blame anyone but themselves.  All I can say is: Make them pay. Send them the bill, please.

      I'm passive-aggressive today, and still not in the mood for talking, writing or posting. I am basically angry and speechless. Yeah.  Everything feels and is wrong today. I am still angered by the shit Britta did in calling my parents yesterday (thereby proving that she indeed is someone I don't want to be friends with), angered by the shitty communications in my family, angered by the fact that I haven't heard from Ev since the end of last week, angered by some shitty people getting at me in shitty ways, angered by how I feel and how little I get done these days and that I didn't even drag my ass to the gym today  angered by...everything and nothing.   aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh.   I should wear a sign around my neck today:  "Beware. Bites."

      I watched CNN this afternoon, at the same time as on September 11th, and hearing about the crash, I sort of  expected  to hear of more crashs, in New York, Washington, wherever else. Standing in the middle of my room the same way I did 9 weeks ago, staring at the TV, I was bracing myself for another attack against the US.  I hate how these past few weeks have changed my perception of the world. I seriously do not deem many things impossible anymore.

      Not many words from me these days. - Somehow, the more I think and figure out, the less I feel the urge to write.  These past few days were okay once I had gotten over the shock of knowing my weight and body fat percentage. Have been almost busy, seeing Tina, studying,  urlLink working out  (to get that frightenting % down), session with Dr.K (which made me realize how much I have indeed profited from therapy so far), picking up stuff from the post office (my  urlLink payback  steam iron arrived), talking to my toyboy on the phone for a few hours.  All rather mundane stuff, and not exactly note- and newsworthy. So I shall remain silent until I got something to say.  No news is good news, right? :)

      For some reason, I don't have much to say these days.  There's a bunch of thoughts circling around in my head, yet when I try to put them in order, it sounds fake, not yet right. I need to give them some more time and space, I guess.  Have dreamt odd things lately, of being in Australia for just one week without any luggage, of icq messages (and in english, too!), of the past. Have had odd memories come up, Frank suddenly appeared in my head, the welcoming party at Dreas first flat, to be exact. I remembered, and quite vividly, too, being in the stairway with him and how he left, early, and reached from one staircase below, through the wooden (green) handrail, and put his hand between my legs again for a minute. Later that night, Thorsten and I would have sex for the last time, and it would be horrible. Don't know where that comes from, haven't thought much about all that in a little while. I forgot the dates, but I'd bet it's been pretty much exactly 7 years ago. - It was on one of these death-related public holidays in November.  Anyway. Autumn (or winter?) has finally arrived, and the weather is as rainy and cold as I wanted it, and I can finally wear thick jumpers and hide and feel good about it. Wore my new polarfleece shirt today, and it felt lovely.   urlLink 34 days to go.

      New moment to look forward to:   December 12th 2001, 07:05pm   (instead of 6am on that day, as previously expected)   Means 11 hours less time with him overall, but makes it far easier to pick him up (no need to spend the entire night at the airport or leave by car at 3am - I guess we'll probably take the train), and far nicer for Ev and his Jetlag, too. Plus we now won't need an excuse to hop into bed straight away. Not that I think we would have needed one anyway. :)  Am getting nervous. It's 5 weeks to go today, and I am getting jittery. It's one of the sweet-sour aspects of this long-distance thing, I guess. The anticipation is unbearable, and you're high on happiness one day, and low with worry the next.  Told Ev today,  that I wondered whether my nervousness is there because we now can no longer pretend that it's not that serious; sounds nice, but isn't correct the longer I think about it - it, or rather "we" were serious pretty much from the start, even after our maybe not so good time in Australia. It's more likely that this fear is there because it is getting  more  serious the longer we have this relationship this odd way. I wonder what is waiting for us in the future. Are we each others lifepartners? Where will we go and how will our relationship evolve? What will happen? - And are we doing the right thing the right way? And all this at a point in my life where I do not have any personal vision for my life. I think about the future and it's blank. I cannot paint a picture of a point in the future where I would definitely be happy, no scenario. I want a future with this relationship, but I worry that if I want a future for it too much, it won't work out; I don't want this relationship to be the only thing I look forward to, I don't want it to be my sole lifeline, but I fear that is what it might be like if we make some sort of more definite committment. I think I would want a more definite comittment, not because I have fallen for the illusion it would make everything easy and secure our relationship, but because it would just manifest -to the outside, and to us- what is there already, what I feel now anyway. Is it important? A bit. It's not that I want a ring, it's not that I am thinking about white dresses and cake deco and wanting to pick out my bridesmaid - (would be Tina anyway!); but I think it would be good if we voiced and expressed our committment to each other somehow, in some formalised way. Sparked by some odd thread at  urlLink Scarleteen , I read a bit about handfasting traditions, but that really wouldn't feel right for neither Ev or me, I think; even though there are tons of ways how one can do a handsal (make a promise for a year and a day, that needs to be renewed every year). It's not our type of tradition, I guess.  Anyway. We're talking about all this, and that's good.  It's just all not so easy and a bit scary, we don't want to scare each other by bringing "marriage" into the picure, but we're trying to keep it all open. Because he wondered, I told him that my (temporary) move to Australia wouldn't mean that he would "have to marry me", and that's true. My move to Melbourne, as abstract as it still is, would probably be as much trying to find out who I really am as wanting to live this relationship "for real". - The least thing on my mind is forcing him into anything. Marriage is not one person persuading the other one into something, it's two people making a joint statement. Well, I assume this will all be an issue we'll address when he's here. The worrying part is maybe this: if all works out well this time, when we have several weeks of normalcy, what is keeping us from making this "formal"?  One other reason that worries me is how we will manage to get over the 10 months apart. Ev said he found it cute that I worried about his reaction to a few recent things that I did so much, but I really am just worried whether we can reconnect easily. Without a doubt, we have both developed in some way in these past months, and I just don't want to be a negative surprise for him in any way. And of course, my little depressed mind doesn't worry about him changing in any bad way. It's always me, rigth? (FYI, that last statement would make my shrink happy: If I told him "I wonder whether he will still find me attractive", he'd tell me "And you don't think he could have changed?")  These are all typical LDR worries I guess: all the build-up before you finally see each other again makes it so easy to start your time together on an odd note. We had that last year, the ridiculous arguments about him going home earlier, the pointless discussions about him and other girls. I still worry about the adjustment time, even though we now know it'll be there (he needs it more than I do) and can communicate about it: it just leaves so much room for odd tones in the first few days, and duh, I just don't want any of the arguments we had during that adjustment time in January. - But then, we were on odd notes before he came over anyway.  In general, I should probably just let things be, I guess, and trust in us and our relationship and the fact we're both so sure now, and are better at that communication thing than ever before.   urlLink 35 days to go.  I can't wait. I seriously can't wait.

       Random realisations about sex scenes in books and movies.   Watching that oh-so-famous-pottery love scene in  urlLink Ghost  on TV tonight (which used to the basis for lots of fantasies of my 12 year old me), I primarily wondered how Mr. the-eighties-are-over-but-my-blowdried-hairdo-is-still-in- Swayze (I always wanted to have a first time like Baby! Tear off my bra and throw it away, Johnny!) and the pre-op and still almost pretty Demi Moore suddenly have clean hands while in the middle of their little pottery romp. Did you run off to the bathroom for a handwash without anyone noticing? Isn't that clay awfully hard to get off?  Far worse was re-reading  urlLink David Rees's "The Estuary"  this weekend, a book proudly purchased in the gay corner of some London bookshop circa 1992, after buying "The Milkman is on it's way" which my friend Ilka had ordered (that was pre-online-book-shopping, after all, for english books, you needed to ask a mate who hopped over to London!), I realised how extremely bad that novel actually is written. And I started to wonder why I liked it at 14.  It can't  just  have been the sex scenes between people of all genders (which are the only bits of that book that I find readable these days. yum. Nothing like that mud fighting scene between Luke and Aaron...hmmmmmm), could it? It can't just have been that grown-up, open feeling I got when I purchased it, either.  My guesses of the moment are... *I just didn't know enough english to realize that exotic words don't mean that something is good; pretentious writing isn't good writing. *All that 1983 sex, clothing, music and living was far closer to reality in 1992 than to what we have now in 2001 (even though people today dress more like 1983 than in 1992, and love to pretend it were 1983). What's rather bothersome though, is the 1983-on-the-verge-of-HIV-Sex. While some sex scenes are quite lovely,  some just (excuse the pun) suck. (quote)  "He was looking at other people's windows, roof-tops and the sky, and his sperm was flooding into someone's throat."  - Nope thanks. Just not cool.  Do you want some condoms with that?  *The main characters are all  younger  than I am today - and they are all nothing but completely out-of-reality-beings. Completely. Especially that Luke guy being heavily into classics, good at sports, aggresive, yet the bisexual super-male. Or that Aaron superstar looking like an angel, but the evil macho. Or that dumb Cheryl chick ending up in a sad marriage when "the love of her life" (which she met at 17) decides to be gay. Well. ALL characters, are sad, apart from that hot andogyne potter John (whose outward appearance reminds me of the hot male currently residing on my desktop) and that Kevin chap maybe. John really is the only interesting character in the entire book, yet stays sort of blurr all the time. Did people like that exist in 1983 GB? If yes: duh. Let's be happy the 80's are over. Let's please not pretend the 80's were good.  Anyway. Life wasn't too bad when that pottery sex scene, and Baby's first time in  urlLink Dirty Dancing  seemed almost pornographic to me and would give enough ideas for a good bunch of fantasies...and when I thought that that "Solitaire" poem in "The Estuary" was actually good and buying a book published by Gay Men's Press was revolutionary.  Maybe being 14 wasn't all that bad. At least I was easier to please.

      Have started reading  urlLink Connie Palmen's "I.M."  again, and that moves me to tears and breaks my heart and makes me long for love and a deep connection to another human being. The openess and wisdom that literally drips out of that book leaves me speechless, the sadness leaves me devastated.  So here I am again, longing for the toyboy.  These last few week seem to be harder than the past 9 months taken together (a number of months, which, btw, reminded me yesterday that if I hadn't  "passed"  that preggie test back in February (when the impossible seemed to have happened), I'd be a mother now. Or not. But I could have been, maybe. Scary.) It's so odd, the last time we saw each other, I couldn't look forward to his arrival because I didn't  know  whether he'd be here. - And now, we've had all these months that we were apart (more time than ever before), that we somehow handled (not that I know how, to be honest), and these last few weeks are starting to be unbearable.  I see couples everywhere, kissing couples, cuddling couples, as if their main goal is rubbing their happiness into my face. I want the toyboy now, want to talk to him, want to sleep with him and next to him, lie next to him and let my hand rest on his hipbone (which has been my property ever since we happened), want to walk through town with him and sit at cheers and have lunch, want to skim for CDs at aktiv with him, want to spend days in bed listening to what we've found...I just want to  be  with him.  And I am getting impatient.  Just about  urlLink 36 days to go , and now that.  Call me pretentious, please. :)

      Low key Sunday, with not much to say.  My mood is still exceptional, even though I had an extremely annoying bout of early morning insomnia again last night. Was up at 1am and from 4am to 6:30. Slept two more hours though, so my energy level was reasonably ok. Maybe it was moving my not so little ass to the gym which helped. Who knows. All gym actions, btw, will from now on be chronicled in the  urlLink workout log - stories of sweat,sore muscles and success , just to not let this take up too much room here.  So all is okay. No phone call today though, even though I could have very well needed one; I hate it when the window of opportunity for calls is two hours shorter than in summer. *sigh*  More later.

      It's 6:20 am, on a Saturday, yet can't seem to sleep anymore. As I have already posted a picture of my belly, I think it's time for stupid test results, me thinks.   urlLink The Movie Test: Is Your Life a True Romance or a Tearjerker?    "Congratulations, you diva, you! If your life were a movie it would be ...   Casablanca   Year of Release: 1942    Most Memorable Line:  "But what about us?" --Ilsa Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman  "We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night." --Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart   "When I said I would never leave you." --Ilsa  "And you never will. But I've got a job to do too. Where I'm going, you can't follow. What I've got to do, you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now. Here's looking at you kid." --Rick   "Sacrifice: This story (the theme of Casablanca, The End of the Affair, The Bridges of Madison County, The Horse Whisperer) is about the conflict between duty and passion, the choice between personal happiness and serving the needs of others. A middle-aged woman who is already married, often with children, a woman who has always led a measured and controlled existence, unexpectedly meets her soul mate and falls passionately in love. She is torn between love and not wanting to hurt others, especially her children. Afraid that her love would never survive her guilt, and fearing the damage it would cause, she sacrifices her love and her personal happiness to avoid hurting others. That is the obvious story.  Beneath the nobility of her renunciation of happiness there is also her fear and guilt. She is terrified that her intense feelings will make her feel out of control. She is afraid to give up the safe, controlled life she has led as well as the social context and conventions that support her. Risking everything for one intense love frightens her." --Marcia Millman, The Seven Stories of Love   Yup. Fitting, I think. I have a thing for relationships that involve planes and leaving, and drama. :) (via  urlLink Mary , who does not agree with her test result that Dirty Dancing is a movie of her life.)

      Am one happy girl today.  Yes, despite being online almost constanly yesterday and staying up and on icq till 5:30am, trying to resolve things. I got some apologies, and this was a start. At least something. By 5:30, I was so jittery that I could hardly type...anyway. Only good thing about all this was that I finally got to talk to both Kitten and Aria via phone, definitely a lovely aspect of all this mess.

      If there is one thing that I hate, it is being portrayed as a liar. And fucking half-truths. And even more I hate people fucking with their  "friends" . If you told me all these lies and half-truths about her, I wonder what the hell you told others about ME.

      First (and most important) message of the day:   urlLink Happy Birthday, Shauny!    "Heute kann es regnen, stürmen oder schnei'n, denn Du strahlst ja selber wie der Sonnenschein. Heut' ist Dein Geburtstag, darum feiern wir, alle Deine Freunde freuen sich mit Dir. Alle Deine Freunde freuen sich mit Dir.  Wie schön, daß Du geboren bist, Wir hätten Dich sonst sehr vermißt. Wie schön daß wir beisammen sind, wir gratulieren Dir, Geburtstagskind.   Uns're guten Wünsche haben ihren Grund: Bitte bleib noch lange glücklich und gesund. Dich so froh zu sehen, ist, was uns gefällt. Tränen gibt es schon genug auf dieser Welt. Tränen gibt es schon genug auf dieser Welt.  Montag, Dienstag, Mittwoch, das ist ganz egal, Dein Geburtstag kommt im Jahr doch nur einmal. Darum laß uns feiern, daß die Schwarte kracht. Heute wird getanzt, gesungen und gelacht. Heute wird getanzt, gesungen und gelacht."   ( urlLink translate with babelfish , to turn this kindergarten birthday song into a dadaistic birthday poem!:)

      10:30 pm at what might -despite shitty and hurtfull and rather typical NY's stuff that has already happened - turn into an awesome night, after all.  Tina and me have been making up odd lyrics top fit Lou Reed's "Perfect Day" already...more to follow, as more alcohol flows.   What a perfect day, have McDonalds at the Gracht, and later, when it gets nacht we"ll get drunk....  Oh what a perfect day, 6 Heineken in the backpack, next two them, two bottles of sekt, we"ll get druuuuunk.  Oh it's such a perfect day...I'm glad i spend it with you oh, what a perfect day, you just keep me hanging on, you just keep me hanging on......   Life is still good, and geez, are we looking good in our tarty outfits, too.   (Tina speaking) I still need some glitter...and then it is just a PERFECT DAY :)

        Good moments of the last few days  :     Singing along to "Ï'm so excited" with Tina and some others in the bar where Tina got free Tequila for her 25 coaster throwing & catching.  Snow everywhere, covering bikes leaning on grachten bridges.  Finding that perfect tarty shirt for New Years.  Again perfecting the art of changing in a lightless room: guess once you've learned that, it's like riding a bike, you're never going to forget it again. Oh, the pleasures of backpacking.  knuffellen.    Life is still good. Have a good New Years.

      Unbelievable that it's been a week since I ever got to touch my computer for more than a minute. Time has stood still and flown by. Being with him and having him here is normal and odd at the same time. I find myself staring at him in disbelief that this beautiful man has flown halfway round the world to see me. I keep touching him at all times, to be assured that he is there. And yes, the bed has been deflowered. And woah, Linnie send some  urlLink Astro , just in time, too. (btw: Love you, dearie, tons, and I am still figuring out what to add to your package!)  It's all overwhelming  and good.  The last week was strange and lovely and magical and lovely yet sometimes a bit emotionally draining (mainly during re-curring discussions about the state of my mental health). But despite that we're happy, I guess, very happy, in fact, and it's like the last 10 months never seperated us. It's been a busy week, too, with Christmas stress and fabulous friends of Ev staying over, and all really is pretty good, even though I am a bit sick and tired and needing a rest now (four people in this flat is a bit much). In any way, I am alive, and all is good.  Heading home tomorrow, so in case I won't get a chance to update: Hope everyone has a peaceful couple of holidays.  Love to you all.

      I did sleep. Shocking. Very shocking. Not much, a meagre 5 hours maybe, but it was probably a wise thing to do.  So it's "the" day now. How weird is that? Really, excuse all that nothingness posted these last hours. I am trying to make sense but I just don't. My brain is taking a break to prepare for whatever sensory fun is ahead, I think, by turning off all intellectual connections.  To waste some time later on, I think I'll get my Christmas Card thing going (which reminds me that I need to prepare 4 packages, too, for the two other angels, and Heather and Ev's family....) In any way, anyone want a christmas card? Handwritten and from Germany and (for those who are fond of Safer Sex) with a complimentary red or green (tis the season to be merry after all) condomi condom?  urlLink Let me know . Would be a pleasure.

Like  urlLink Saigonsam   urlLink posted , it is rather unlikely that I'll sleep (especially now that I've consumed all three cans of Pepsi Max that I purchased earlier today), even though that would prolly be the wise thing to do; sleep I mean.

      The lovely Aria checked my scary cat killing dream in her dream reference book for the symbolics.   "Poisoned animals in a dream indicate domestic troubles.  To give a poison in a dream symbolises a broken friendship or love affair."  "a dream of kittens indicates a pleasant but unimportant love affair."  "to dream of killing animals predicts that you will overcome your obsticles through your own efforts"  "blue indicates liberation from worry and / or help from outside sources"   Interesting, hm? Thankfully, that cat wasn't a kitten, just a small Abyssinian. No meaningless affairs at the mo. In general, this seems to support Tinas analysis, hm?

      I am very "off" today, for whatever reason.  Woke up at 4am, after a horrible, horrible dream in which I poisoned a cat with window cleaner (a killing method which was inspired by watching bits of "Copycat" last Saturday; the cat was a tiny abyssinian, with large blue eyes, not like either of my cats). It was very bizarre. That cat was given to me to look after, and I was ordered to kill it. I didn't want to do it, felt very guilty afterwards, yet while watching the horribly slow death of the cat in my hallway, I didn't feel like I could change anything or help her. The cat, btw, was eerily human when dying. Like changing pictures rapidly between cat and human, don't know. I was lying on the floor next to the cat when she died.  Tina thinks that I am the cat in the dream, and that this is about how I feel at home. I order myself to be the way my parents want me to be (that's what's behind the order theme that robbed me of any choices in the dream) and it's literally killing me. My initial idea was that this was about me and how I sabotage whatever project or duty is given to me.  Anyway. It was a sucky dream, that left me awake for several hours. Nice.  Next thing was that my mother told me during a phone call in the morn that my father apparently worries about me. For a change not about uni, my work or future, but about Evan and my relationship. He told my mother that he worried that Evan will just go back to Australia and not care about me and that this is all fake. Wonder why in all the world, if it worries him that much, he doesn't talk to me about it. It's nice to know that he *does* worry about me, but quite honestly, if Evan didn't care, why in all the world would he go at these lengths to be with me? Why would he keep up this thing for 2 years to play with me? Doesn't quite make sense, does it? The easier way would most definitely be being with someone in Australia. Oh well. Told my mother that I appreciated his worry, but was offended by it coming out in inappropriate statements such as " You and Evan shouldn't come here at Christmas"  Wonder what Dr.K will say to all this. Maybe I should simply ask my father about it, and ask him why he can't discuss this with me, from adult to adult. Anyway.  Did my laundry this morning, and really, that has lightened up my day a bit, even though an unidentified piece of clothing has again discoloured some stuff. Some of my favourite microfiber g-strings are now a slight hue of pink, and I am not amused. Wonder whether it was the discoloured pink stuff from last time or my pink pjs that are to blame here. When I went to pick up my laundry, a very pretty boy sat on the washers staring at the spin cycle and chatting me up almost immediately, in the loveliest way. Was a funky, taxing, flirt about what we do (and about our laundry), and really, it made me smile. Nothing like a funky little flirt to light up your day. In all honesty: I needed it. Have been so out of the lighthearted flirting circuit (if you don't take Andre into consideration that is). and well, it is calming to know that someone finds me appealing on first look even when I am wearing laundry day clothes and a beanie to hide my hair.  Off to do some ironing though, which is, after all, one of my fave household duties ever. Yay.   Preparations:  going well.  Excitement level:  'tis almost unbearable. Just two more nights alone in this bed.

      Things I find disturbing on a Sunday morning:   An  urlLink "MTV  Masters" about Britney Spears.  MTV  MASTERS ? Pardon me. Nothing against Britney, let's not take liposuction, silicone breasts, playing the holy whore thing or whatever else into consideration (she does have nice abs after all), but a show called "Masters" about someone who published a total of three albums? I don't think so. One of the reasons I do not watch MTV these days.   This banner ad for the anti-depressant  urlLink Effexor   in my WebMD Mental Health Newsletter.

      It's all a bit strange, I confess. It's now just about 90 hours before the toyboy arrives (for the exact time, please add 19 hours to the time displayed  urlLink here ), and yes, I am starting to get excited. Like unable-to-eat-sleep-think-straight excited.  Part of me still doesn't quite believe that it will happen, that he will arrive and we will be together and that all will be well. It was the same last year, too: Even standing at the train station early that Wednesday morning, waiting for the train to take me to the airport, I thought something would keep me from hopping on the plane. And well, earlier this year, I never had time to get used to the idea of him arriving. And when he was there, in that cinema, because it was so spontaenous and unplanned, it was all very surreal, and it took us several days and fights before issues were resolved and all was well.  And now, he's almost here, and for the first time ever, all is good, we're both happy and looking forward to meeting up, convinced that this relationmship is good and can be good, and there is a very good chance it can all be good and fine, maybe even  perfect  this time. No family around to disturb us, no Jen, no unresolved issues at the moment, and my level of depression is reasonably low.  Yet, I am a little scared. Not because I doubt us, but quite honestly, the kind of relationship we have is not exactly the easiest kind, we've made oir fair share of mistakes tp prove that, and putting it into the real life is always an experiment. Without a doubt, we have both changed and developed, even if only in small ways, in these past 10 months. Suddenly being together again will be both like recognizing and re-discovering the person  that you know inside and out and to the core, the person that you love, and like discovering and getting used to new things about that person. I am not talking about our new and improved bodies here, even though that alone can be eerie (back when I was with D, after he returned from his 4 months in Brazil, our two completely overhauled bodies in bed were more than odd) but - while is a bit worrisome whether your body in real life (including stretch marks and other flaws) can compete with 10 months worth of fantasizing about it- really about deeper things. Yes, we talk lots, and exchange views, but there really is nothing quite like being together,  waking up and falling asleep next to each other, like talking non stop, about important and unimportant things, like expressing feelings without words, like touching, holding, feeling. Nothing can substitute non-verbal communication.  I really don't have the words to express what I feel. In my head, I've been making up scenarios about what it will be like to pick him up at the airport or what being on the train home from the airport might be like together, but the pictures inside my head are blurry, and I try to not imagine (and as a result expect) too much. I know already that it will be overwhelming and strange to see him in 3D. And I don't want to put the stress of too high epxectations on us either. No too extensive scenarios: he might be terribly tired and jetlagged, after all. Last time, because of the surreal situation in the cinema, the cameras, the attention and the fact we had to do that welcoming scene a whole of what 3 times? 4 times? (I can't even remember.), it took several hours (or rather days) until I realised that that person there was him, and that he was real, too. What will it be like this time?  I also wonder about what being partnered again will be like. I don't worry about the living together bit much, because I know we've always be good at that (even though a few selected rules will be imposed this time, such as:  "unpacking completely is a must, and a backpack in this room for the entire 7 weeks will not be tolerated" ), but it will be so exciting and kinda "new" again to sleep next to him, to touch and hold and kiss and taste and smell. Have been craving touching so badly these past months, that I at times felt like my body had fallen asleep to touching. With all that working out, and reconnecting with my body that feeling has faded, but still, there is no substitute for all this, and I wonder whether it will be overwhelming or not, to go from zero to onehundred % so quickly. The one thing I care about the most is that we can manage to give each other enough room to make that transition. Not easy to reconnect and leave enough room for each other and even harder to want closeness or time apart at the exact same time, too. - And to communicate about your needs easily, after that much time apart.  In any way, this is all exciting. Oh so very exciting. And while my top priority is still to be in a reasonably good shape health wise by Wednesday, the other things on the (finally jotted down) to do list really aren't all that bad anymore. It will all be done on time.  Gee, people, I am happy. And (have I mentioned that yet?) excited, too. :)  eeeeeep!

      Last night was good.  A nice christmas party, with christmas party humor and talk and jokes. Really, overall, it was fun, even though Bernhard, who had organised it all, should have made a warning re: clothing, as the anticipated walk was a lot longer (and colder) than expected. In any way, it was a good evening. Met at the centre, and Gudrun had gotten envelopes with orders for the group. Caught a train to a place nearby, hopped out there, walked in the crisp clean air and sunset for a good hour before we met Bernhard in the middle of nowhere, who read out a funny christmas story edited in such a way that everyone from ProFa was mentioned. Very sharp humour. Walked some more, until we reached the winery of some friends of Bernhard, where the real party took place. Had food, and a wine tasting and laughed a lot during silly games and wore Santa hats for the majority of the evening. The things you do at Christmas parties. It really was nice overall, even though I was totally drained when we finally took the train home just after ten. Bit much for me, the first day out of bed. Andre was there, and well, to be honest (and without trying to exaggerate my influence on him), it wasn't entertaining at all to see the look on his face & his reaction when someone asked details about Ev's arrival and our relationship in general. Got a sarcastic  "so you two are in love then" . Ouch. He had known about him in the first place, so? But still: Evil me. Playing doesn't feel nice if someone appears to be hurt after all.  Anyway.  Somehow, Saturday is already over, too. Was a quiet day that passed in a flash. Slept late after more strange dreams, talked to Ev, went to the gym with Tina for a gentle workout and the rather stunning discovery that I have lost 9 pounds (here's hoping it wasn't just muscle from not working out for a week), and spend the rest of the day recovering from the working out and yesterady in my bed, dozing to the tv. Now it's 6pm, I think I should cook (or buy somewhere) a real meal, and other things on my to do list for the rest of the weekend are.... sorting additions into my law books and doing some study, cleaning the bathroom and hall (the rest of my place is shockingly clean already), answering long waiting eMail, and giving myself a mani- and pedicure. Will try my best at doing any of that. Oh well. Not so good news of the day: my killer perioral dermatitis has returned, and only the higher beings know what sparked this. The weather & cold? (but then I had it in the middle of summer, too) Any cleaning agents used yesterday morn? My just overcome flu? The fact I washed my face three times yesterday? The stress? My dermatologist would assume the latter, I think. Anyway. No hard feelings to my face as of yet. Need to care for it better, obviously. Enough rambling for now.  It is very very dark outside, sleepy me feels like it's already the middle of the night. Now on to search for some food.

I can't quite remember the complete context, but what I remember is that saigonsam and me were a team in a paintball fight, and miss shauny was watching us from a balcony above the field, at her company's christmas party, surrounded by people with champagne glasses, waving at saigonsam and me.  Wick MediNait (NyQuil) induced dreams are funky.

      Am sitting here, listening to my "down and out" winamp playlist, even though I really am not down at all. "A Song for the lovers" is running right now, and that glorious, glorious song always reminds me of the first time I ever heard it, standing with Ev in the middle of his room in Melbourne one night, (and I am dead sure that I have mentioned that before) being overwhelmed by the longing and the drive of the music and the lyrics and whatever was going on inside my head back then.  Today was a surprisingly hectic day, really, that passed by in the blink of an eye, just like the last few days and weeks have.  Studied some, checked some stuff with train tickets out for Ev, and around noon went out shopping for Ev's and Tina's Adventscalendar. I know, rather embarrassing to do it on the 6th of December, but then, Ev won't need his until the 12th, and Tina already got her bit for the 1st (which is World AIDS Day, so everyone gets condoms and Safer Sex info), so I really am not all that lazy and bad. Now please, imagine me standing at the cashiers at the supermarket, buying the following things: two bottles of water, two packs of choc rusks and two things each of various kinds of chocolates and sweets (overall, a good 50 or so pieces). It looked like the shopping basket of a severly bulimic/overeating (because of the water, and the amount of very unhealthy food) obsessive compulsive (because it was two of each I had) person. I swear, everyone in line stared at me, and I really could hardly compose myself, it was so very very entertaining.  Hopped into ProFa later to do some computer stuff, bring the  urlLink ridiculous little website  up to date and upload some pics to it, help Nicole with some letters and inquire about tomorrow: Tis the ProFa Christmas party/excursion tomorrow, and apart from Bernhard, who organised it all, no one knows what's going to happen; all very exciting. We're meeting at 4pm at the center, and will take it from there. Wasn't allowed to come to the excursion in the summer (they didn't take any volunteers along back then), so this will be  a new thing .  Andre, who hadn't reacted to my message left in his drawer last week (leaving my eMail addie and inquiring about when I would get the questionnaire from him), was there, too, and spend an odd amount of time in the office with Nicole and me, expecting something from me, apparently. Interesting. Entertaining, too. Looking forward to tomorrow. I expect, at the least, some nice food and drink and entertaining conversations. Not bad, not bad. The rest of the day was spent wrapping all the single pieces of unhealthy "food" into little packs, and number then and make them nice and displayable (Tina's packs are all tied together, Ev's reside in a nice green stitched Christmas bag). Oh, I can be such a creative little ass and good friend sometimes. hehe.  *patting myself on the back*   So this was today. Am feeling relatively ok, even though this afternoon, some mighty big headache attacked me and made me realize that maybe I've overdone it today already. So tomorrow I'll try to spend the morning nice and low and cleaning my flat, finally. Later, Tina and I will be out lingerie shopping (for her, not me) before I need to rest to prepare for the wild aftenoon and evening that's probably/hopefully ahead of me. All well, all well. And for goodness sake, 6 days from now, he'll be here. I write that down, but really can not quite grasp it  Fucking unbelievable. :)   i spend the night yeah looking for my insides in a hotel room waiting for you  we're gonna make it tonight yeah something in the air tells me the time is right so we'd better get it on  and dj, play a song for the lovers, tonight please, play a song for the lovers, tonight  don't wanna wait lord i've been waiting all my life but i'm too late again i know but i was scared  can't you see i'm moving like a train into some foreign land i ain't got a ticket for this ride but i will  ooh, play a song for the lover, tonight dj, play a song for the lover, tonight dj, play a song for the lovers, tonight please play a song for the lovers, tonight  can't stop looking back no no one more for the lovers  oh brother won't you lend a hand i'm alone in a room and i'm waiting for love i don't know when this trains gonna stop but i'm telling you friend i don't want to get up    a song for the lovers  ~richard ashcroft~

No "BRITNEY SUCKS HORSE DICK", no boring "Copy all DVDs" not "FIND YOUR LIFEPARTNER" or "CONSOLIDATE DEBT", not "We've located your money" or "You have been approved".  It's   "Watch Wild Birds Hatch Thru Your Window"   868 times. Unbelievable. Very bizarre. Blessed be the Hotmail Junk Mail folder.

      Have I mentioned it lately? I think I have, but I will do it again:   Tina is my queen. My hero. The bestest mate in the world.   She came over this afternoon, and what did she bring? Pepsi light and  urlLink Brandt Rusks .   knowing you can always count on me, for sure that's what friends are for for good times and bad times i'll be on your side forever more that's what friends are for   :)  How blessed I am to have her. Indeed.  In other news: Phone call with the toyboy, who also can't really belive that it's  urlLink just a week(!) to go . Managed to drag my sniffing, headachy self into the cellar and clean it up and make enough space to get the old mattress and some other random stuff that was cluttering up this tiny appartement in there. Need to throw lots of stuff out and give it to charity, but really, for now I can use my kitchen again, and have some storage space both up here and in the cellar. wow.  Excuse me, I am exhausted now though and need to collapse into my huge new bed now, eat a rusk or two and watch  urlLink Buffy  and  urlLink Angel  later on.  Life is surprisingly good, if you do not take the state of my health into consideration.

       Footnote to World AIDS Day.  How could I forget posting text from one of the best films dealing with HIV/AIDS? It is Derek Jarman's "Blue". - If you can call it a film, that is. You get to sit in front of an Yves Klein monochrome blue screen, for the entire 76 minutes of the film, with poems, lists of medications and excerpts from Jarman's diary being read, spoken, over a soundscape of music and noises. Brilliant piece of art. And even without the blue screen, the words get to you.    blue ~derek jarman  blue bottle buzzing lazy days the sky blue butterfly sways on a cornflower lost in the warmth of the blue heat haze singing the blues quiet and slowly blue of my heart blue of my dreams slow blue love of delphinum days   blue is the universal love in which man bathes  it is the terrestrial paradise  i'm walking along the beach in a howling gale another year is passing in the roaring waters i hear the voices of dead friends love is life that lasts forever my hearts memory turns to you david howard graham terry paul  but what if that present were the worlds last night in the setting sun our love fades fails to rise thrice denied by cock crow in the dawn's first light  ....  the virus rages fierce. i have no friends now who are not dead or dying. like a blue frost it caught them. at work, at the cinema, on marches and beaches. in churches on thei knees, running, flying, silent or shouting protest.  it started with sweats in the night and swollen glands. then the black cancers spread across the faces  as they fought breath tb and pneumonia hammered the lungs, and toxo at the brain. reflexes scrambled  sweat poured through hair matted like lianas in the tropical forest. voices slurred  and then were lost forever. my pen chased this story across the page, tossed this way and that in the storm.  ...  here i am again in the waiting room. hell on earth is a waiting room. here you know you are not in control of yourself, waiting for your name to be called: "712213". here you have no name, confidentiality is nameless. where is 666? am i sitting opposite him/her? maybe 666 is the demented woman switching the channels on the tv.  ...  how are we perceived if we are perceived at all? for the most part, we are invisible.  ...  in the paper today: three quarters of the aids organisations are not providing safer sex information. one district said they had  no queers in the community, but you might try district x  they have a theatre.  ...  the darkness comes in with the tide the year slips on the calendar your kiss flares a match struck in the night flares and dies my slumber broken kiss me again kiss me kiss me again and again never enough greedy lips speedwell eyes blue skies  ...  a young man frail as belsen walks slowly down the corridor his pale green hospital pyjamas hanging off him  it's very quiet just the sit and coughing my jugsy eye blots out the young man who walked past my field of vision this illness knocks you out for six just as you start to forget it a bullet in the back of the head might be easier you know, you can take longer than the second world war to get to the grave  ...  i caught myself looking at shoes in a shop window. i thought of going in and buying a pair, but stopped myself. the shoes i am wearing at the moment should be sufficient to walk me out of life.  pearl fishers in azure seas deep waters washing the isle of the dead in coral harbours amphora spill golf across the still seabed we lie there fanned by the billowing sails of forgotten ships tossed by the mournful winds of the deep lost boys sleep forever in a dear embrace salt lips touching in submarine gardens cool marble fingers touch an antique smile shell sounds whisper deep love drifting o the tide forever the smell of him dead good looking in beauty's summer his blue jeans around his ankles bliss in my ghostly eye  kiss me on the lips on the eyes our name will be forgotten in time no one will remember our work our life will pass like the traces of a cloud and be scattered like mist that is chased by the rays of the sun for our time is the passing of a shadow and our lives will run like sparks through the stubble  i place a delphinum, blue, upon your grave

      I swear, it happened because I thought to myself late Sunday Night  "What a miracle that I haven't gotten sick this winter yet despite my not eating, the vitamins must be working." .  I woke up Monday morn with a sore throat so bad that I could barely talk, fought my way through dis-assembling my old bed, assembling my new bed (with the gracious help of queen Tina), carrying bed parts through town and to the shop and back to my flat in a sweat and feeling like hell; headed off to IKEA and shopped for some necessities (sheets for the new bed) before I literally collapsed into the new bed, which feels divine and is so big that I feel lonely in there alone: but I slept crappily, as one does when sick. Had a therapy session this morn (which was good), shopped for about 3 food items before I headed home to collapse into bed yet again. Where I stayed for a big chunck of the day.  I swear, all of this is to blame on not eating. That's how I got the sore throat, and ear infection and whatever else is bothering me. To top that off, I made the mistake of taking medication supposed to be taken with food without food, suffered from stomach cramps for about 6 hours. So bad that I couldn't walk. Nice.  In any way, I am off to bed. Don't expect any splendid entertainment from me anytime soon. I can't hear and am moody and feeling like shit. And yes, my to do list still isn't written (even though the unwritten one is significantly shorter now that the bed has been organised and set up), and yes, he's arriving tomorrow in a week and I can't wait, and whatnot. Plus I have a new bed waiting to be deflowered.  Anyone who loves me and wants to be nice, bring over some rusks and make tea for me, please? I need someone to look after me. *pout*  Before you head over: The offer of deflowering the bed is only open to the toyboy though, sorry. ;)  More when I feel better.  ginger: eMail reply coming soon, promise.

      Am all computered out after yesterday's little tour de force. But it was good, and needed, and I enjoyed, it, too. To see how much *I* had learned throughout all this, I did the little  urlLink HIV/AIDS knowledge test at avert.com  this morning, and scored 100% in the general questions, 70% in the statistics section, and 80% in the harder general type questions. Not too shabs, me thinks.  Two things I didn't mention yesterday, even though they would have been suitable, was that I hopped over the KaJo (the main pedestrian preceinct) around noon yesterday, on my way to the supermarket, to pay a visit to the people I know from the local AIDShilfe chapter who had their stand there. They were super busy doing the usual World AIDS Day collecting donations/giving out ribbons/dispensing condoms thing, and it was nice to see them all again (met everyone when doing the cinema thing a few weeks back), dontated some money, looked over the stuff (which I all knew, obviously), and again offered some help to the gal (whose name I have forgotten) from the HIV positive women's initiative, to do some online stuff for them. Let's see whether she calls this time. While the funding situation of the AIDShilfen all over Germany sure is getting more and more difficult, I must say that what is easier for them, in contrast to ProFa, is that they don't need to explain to people what exactly they do, and why support is important. Everyone sure was flocking to their stand yesterday. - All well deserved, of course.  Other thing I didn't mention was that I watched Philadelphia for the xst time. And yes, I cried, as usually. I felt so edgy and enraged and sad all day yesterday that I needed that; athere wasn't a candlelight vigil this year where I could have done that and gotten some support and be around people, I needed to let go in front of the TV. I didn't cry for Tom Hanks character, or for the story (the more often I see it, the more I see how this is not a typical AIDS story at all, and that I hate the fact that there isn't even a kiss between Antonio Banderas and Tom Hanks), I cried for Wilton and Glenn, and Pedro Zamora, and Nkosi Johnson, for the vietnamese sex worker (but not for the idiotic backpacker from denmark who wanted to screw her without a condom) and the young chap frm the staying alove docu, and for everyone else who died or is as dying as a result of AIDS. It was quite the same feeling I had when I watched the movie for the first time, years ago, on holiday in London with Anna, in a theatre on King's Road, in lovely Chelsea, near our hotel. I cried because no one should die that way, that young. I cried because of the prejudice surrounding the disease, and being gay, and because no dumb kid at the boards mentioned World AIDS day. I cried because it is such a frightening disease, and while it appears to be easily manageable in the western world, people in Africa are without weapons against it.  So that was that. It helped though.  Anyway. Today was a low day, that passed by in a flash, just like yesterday.  urlLink Worked out for 2 hours , cooked dinner, watched Making the band, and now it's almost 9pm, somehow, and my place is still a mess; a mess that I need to clean up as my mattress is delivered tomorrow morn. Didn't tidy up my cellar yet. Need to do that as soon as the mattress has been delivered. Busy day tomorrow, no doubt. Also need to answer some nice eMail tonight, just I didn't quite manage that this weekend so far; and also need to start the stupid stupid Amsterdam Hotel hunt again. Because lo and behold, just like I predicted it, the friend of Ev who had offered to organise it has backed out. The hotel he recommended was a killing 145 Euros anyway, and pardon me, no, I can not afford that. Not even if that's for a triple room.  Ack. Tina found that all rather funny, and you know it is. It's like I predicted it, and just what I wanted to prevent.  Anyway. This much for now, got a room to tidy up now. And a piercing to clean, which i neglected these last days a bit, stupid me, it was no nice and not red until the evil evil ab work out this morn. That aside, I think I might really need to do a real to do list one of these days. Otherwise, I'll never get it all done before Ev arrives.

        will you still love me tomorrow? ~the shirelles~   tonight you're mine completely you give your love so sweetly tonight the light of love is in your eyes but will you love me tomorrow?  is this a lasting treasure or just a moment's pleasure? can i believe the magic of your sighs? will you still love me tomorrow?  tonight with words unspoken you say that i'm the only one but will my heart be broken when the night meets the morning sun?  i'd like to know that your love is love i can be sure of so tell me now, and i won't ask again will you still love me tomorrow? will you still love me tomorrow?      ...and with this song, which  if you read or hear it and think about the impact HIV/AIDS has had on relationships, becomes almost unbearably sad for me, the "anything but...sanity"  World AIDS Day 2001 Special Coverage  as part of  urlLink linkandthink 2001  concludes.  I hope you followed some of the links, learned something new or were reminded of something and got thinking. And I hope you weren't completely put off by my sexpert tone sometime. Blame it on the  urlLink boards , I am used to talk about these issues with young 'uns. :)  However, let's not forget that we all should be practising Safer Sex 24/7/365, and that HIV positive people and the organisations that support them need our donations, attention and support all year round, too. So please, let's all try to think/care/worry about HIV/AIDS more often than just on December 1st every year. For our own health, and our global well-being.

        AIDS in africa:death stalks a continent  Without a doubt, Sub Saharan Africa has the hardest hit part of the world by the HIV/AIDS pandemic. Earlier this year, TIME Magazine had an excellent special report on AIDS in Africa:  urlLink Death Stalks a continent   The  urlLink main article  begins like this:  "Imagine your life this way.  You get up in the morning and breakfast with your three kids. One is already doomed to die in infancy. Your husband works 200 miles away, comes home twice a year and sleeps around in between. You risk your life in every act of sexual intercourse. You go to work past a house where a teenager lives alone tending young siblings without any source of income. At another house, the wife was branded a whore when she asked her husband to use a condom, beaten silly and thrown into the streets. Over there lies a man desperately sick without access to a doctor or clinic or medicine or food or blankets or even a kind word. At work you eat with colleagues, and every third one is already fatally ill. You whisper about a friend who admitted she had the plague and whose neighbors stoned her to death. Your leisure is occupied by the funerals you attend every Saturday. You go to bed fearing adults your age will not live into their 40s. You and your neighbors and your political and popular leaders act as if nothing is happening.  Across the southern quadrant of Africa, this nightmare is real. The word not spoken is AIDS, and here at ground zero of humanity's deadliest cataclysm, the ultimate tragedy is that so many people don't know - or don't want to know - what is happening."   It really is an excellent article that goes in depth about local traditions harming HIV protection or treatment. I remember a part that shocked me most was this bit about the truck driver Chikoka. For me, it illustrated that unless local communities begin changing social structures and send a stronger message of responsibility to men, and unless people get comprehensive sex education that shows why local traditions are harmful, and how they need to be changed to make them safer, it will be hard to put a hold to the situation in Sub Saharan Africa.   "Chikoka nods his head toward another woman sitting beside a stack of cardboard cartons. "We like better to go to them," he says. They are the "businesswomen," smugglers with gray-market cases of fruit and toilet paper and toys that they need to transport somewhere up the road. "They come to us, and we negotiate privately about carrying their goods." It's a no-cash deal, he says. "They pay their bodies to us." Chikoka shrugs at a suggestion that the practice may be unhealthy. "I been away two weeks, madam. I'm human. I'm a man. I have to have sex."   What he likes best is dry sex. In parts of sub-Saharan Africa, to please men, women sit in basins of bleach or saltwater or stuff astringent herbs, tobacco or fertilizer inside their vagina. The tissue of the lining swells up and natural lubricants dry out. The resulting dry sex is painful and dangerous for women. The drying agents suppress natural bacteria, and friction easily lacerates the tender walls of the vagina. Dry sex increases the risk of HIV infection for women, already two times as likely as men to contract the virus from a single encounter. The women, adds Chikoka, can charge more for dry sex, 50 or 60 rands ($6.46 to $7.75), enough to pay a child's school fees or to eat for a week.   Chikoka knows his predilection for commercial sex spreads AIDS; he knows his promiscuity could carry the disease home to his wife; he knows people die if they get it. "Yes, HIV is terrible, madam," he says as he crooks a finger toward the businesswoman whose favors he will enjoy that night. "But, madam, sex is natural. Sex is not like beer or smoking. You can stop them. But unless you castrate the men, you can't stop sex  and then we all die anyway."

        staying alive  Just watched the docu  urlLink staying alive  produced and sponsored by  urlLink MTV ,  urlLink UNAIDS ,  urlLink The World Bank  and  urlLink Kaiser Family Foundation . Am impressed. Very impressed indeed. But then, MTV (over here) has always been very good in regards to HIV education. Missed out on the latest one, and only saw staying alive2. Hope I get to see a repeat of staying alive 3; otherwise I'll have to watch it online.

        testing  According to a study published last Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a whopping 30% of people who were considered at risk for HIV had never been tested. These results suggest that a substantial segment of people with the virus don't realize they have it and are probably spreading it. For the study, please check out  urlLink CNN:Health .  Getting an HIV antibody test is the only way you can find out whether you are infected with HIV or not. Worried about getting an STD screen or HIV test? Getting a screen when you've been irresponsible is scary, yes, but necessary. For all about STD screenings, check out  urlLink Scarleteen: Testing, Testing 1,2,3 ; for all about HIV tests, check out  urlLink What U do: What happens when you test for HIV .

        not faceless: nkosi johnson  Nkosi Johnson, who was born with HIV and became an outspoken champion of others infected with the AIDS virus, died in June 2001 of the disease he battled for all 12 years of his life.   Nkosi had been praised for his openness about his infection in South Africa, a country where people suspected of carrying the AIDS virus often are shunned by their families and chased from their communities. Former South African President Nelson Mandela called him an "icon of the struggle for life."   "Children, such as Nkosi Johnson, should be enjoying a life filled with joy and laughter and happiness,"  Mandela said in a recent statement.  "On a frightening scale, HIV/AIDS is replacing that joy, laughter and happiness with paralyzing pain and trauma."   Nkosi achieved lots in his life: together with his foster mother, he successfully fought to force a public primary school to admit him, a fight that led to a policy forbidding schools from discriminating against HIV-positive children, and to guidelines for how schools should treat infected pupils. He became internationally known with a speech at the opening of the 13th International AIDS conference last July in Durban, South Africa, in which he asked that AIDS sufferers no longer be stigmatized. He also raised money for Nkosi's Haven, a Johannesburg shelter for HIV-positive women and their children.

        not faceless: pedro zamora  Pedro Zamora, who probably gave AIDS a face for many people my age, died at age 22 of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in November 1994, as a result of HIV/AIDS.   Pedro was an AIDS activist and educator who had found out about his infection at age 17. I had first read about him in a book on HIV I got in 1992 or 1993 called  "HIV  a virus ain't picky"  which delivered short answers to common questions on HIV transmission, Safer Sex and AIDS and featured short interviews of young people with HIV. One of them was Pedro, describing how he felt on the day that he was told he was HIV positive; the same Pedro who would, in 1994, move into a house on San Francisco's Russian Hill, to be filmed for several months for MTV's "The Real World in SF". Back then, reality TV was new & hot & different from what it is today, and being an openly gay & HIV positive young man of Cuban descent on that show, a US show, was revolutionary in its own way. Pedro came across as a very sympathetic, loving, open guy, who shared lots with the audience, including the marriage to his partner.  He died very shortly after the last episode of "Real World" was broadcast, and I remember sitting in front of my parent's tv watching the tribute to Pedro's life and being completely and utterly devastated; I hadn't known this man, had never met him, but had watched a part of his life, and spirit and brilliance, and knowing that that life was lost, no matter whether it would affect my life directly, was unbelievably saddening.  His friend and fellow Real World Cast member  urlLink Judd Winick  (the comic guy), publicly spoke about Pedro and HIV/AIDS in the months after he had passed away, and drew and wrote a much praised book about his friendship with Pedro called  urlLink Pedro and me  and wrote extensively about his friend  urlLink on his website . You can also see  urlLink Pedro's quilt  at the  urlLink AIDSquilt: The Names Project .

        recommended reading /both fiction and facts dealing with HIV/AIDS   Alan Gurganus  urlLink "Plays well with others"  (1997):  "Written with erotic candor and wild comic energy, Plays well with Others is a great novel about contemporary Manhattan and the AIDS pandemic. A group of friends, gifted, ambitious and sexually venturesome, are poised to the brink of fame, even artistic immortality, when an unaccountable disease makes its own career among them."   Armistead Maupin  urlLink "Tales of the City I-VI" :  A group pf people connected by a house on Russian Hill and it's transsexual landlady, shares the highs and lows of the 70's and 80's in San Francisco. Heartbreakingly funny and heartbreaking, too, it is full of characters of all genders and orientations that you don't want to let go. I cried when Jon, Michael Mouse Tolliver' gynaecologist partner dies, and I cried during Maupin's  urlLink Maybe the Moon , too, when I read that Ned, Michael's workmate in the Tales, died of AIDS, too. Maupin mixes up fiction and real life to such a degree that you just can not get away from his characters; you do not put any book of his down for a pause. And well, you just gotta love Michael Mouse in his search for love. No way around it.   Simon Garfield  urlLink "The End of Innocence  Britain in the Time of AIDS"  (1996):  A powerful book on the arrival of HIV in the UK and the failure of the government to adequately react. Deals with both personal experience, medical and legal issues and historics of HIV. Obviously dated now in regards to research, but very direct in language, gripping in style and moving in regards to the personal accounts.   David Rees  urlLink "Packing it in" :  The coda to David Rees autobiography "not for your hands" is a travel diary/collection of short essays that describes Rees's travels as a gay HIV positive men who knows about the finality of his travels. Stunning not just for the accurate descriptions of traveling in Australia and New Zealand (and others), but also for the distinct view on the gay life he observes has he travels.

        no lessons learned?   "A generation ago, we dreamed of the day when AIDS would no longer take so much from usour innocence, our loved ones, our hope. That day arrived in our community in 1996 with the advent of protease inhibitors and their unprecedented ability to stabilize the AIDS virus. And what have we done with this remarkable opportunity? Unfortunately, the answer is "not much." [...]  Where is our horror and indignation? Where are the impassioned speeches? What ever happened to safer-sex campaigns? Where are the celebrities wearing red ribbons at every awards event? Why are our community leaders and politicians so silent? What became of our tearful promises to the loved ones that perished from AIDS that "never again" would we allow something so preventable to kill our own people? It seems as if the freight trains from our inner-city ghettos to the Auschwitz of AIDS are running full speed and we are doing precious little to stop them. Those of us who witnessed the long nightmare of the pre-1996 AIDS pandemic are scratching our collective heads and asking ourselves, Why is this happening again? Are we doomed to repeat this nightmare with every new generation? While it is clear that recreational drug use and the arrogance and ignorance of youth have a role to play, there must be something more fundamental at work here.  Has AIDS just become yesterdays news? Has the newfound health of previously dying people given us a false sense of security? Have we all moved on to care more about AIDS in Africa than at home? Are the currently fashionable, more fund-raiser-friendly conditions du jourlike breast cancer and Alzheimersblinding us to the continuing grim statistics of the domestic HIV pandemic? Have the pharmaceutical industrys advertisements for HIV medications portraying AIDS patients with healthy, bright-faced models numbed us to the uglier realities of living with HIV infection?

        does love protect you?   urlLink Is HIV still a risk if you're faithful to your partner?   "Being in love, going steady, or even getting married does not automatically protect you from HIV. The virus doesn't know how you feel. You can only get HIV from someone who is infected with HIV, and even then only if you do things that can spread the virus. But even people who have sex with only one person can get HIV. People don't always tell the truth, and they don't always know if they are infected. [...]Sometimes it is just easier to protect yourself than to keep track of other people. Even people you really like can have things going on that you just don't know about."   urlLink What You do  is a comprehensive resource for teens about HIV & AIDS.

        not faceless: hiv and action against it around the world  As mentioned before, HIV is color-blind, orientation-blind, culture-blind and gender-blind. HIV/AIDS has countless faceless.

        AIDS: 20 years of an epedemic   "On June 5, 1981, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a notice on page two of its Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report about a strange outbreak of killer pneumonia striking homosexual men. From that obscure beginning, AIDS grew into the public health disaster of our time, a global phenomenon that has tested social, cultural, religious and scientific beliefs. Twenty years later -- with expensive drug therapies but no cure or vaccine in sight -- AIDS continues to spread rapidly, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Many researchers warn that the worst is yet to come."   urlLink CNN: in depth HIV/AIDS  is not *that* in depth if you compare it to some other resources available, but offers information on from what a retrovirus is, to a timeline of HIV, a focus on HIV/AIDS in Africa to some recent news. This was first launched this summer, for the 20 year anniversary of the discovery of HIV.

        global statistics  From  urlLink The UNAIDS: AIDS epidemic update report, December 2001   In 2001, there were  14.000 new AIDS infections a day , more than 95% of new infections occurred in developing countries. Of these 14.000 daily infections,  6.000 cases  (which is half of all new infections in adults per day) are  in people between the ages of 15 and 24 . In all newly infected people over 15, almost 50% are female. Overall, 5 Million people, of whom 800.00 were children, were newly infected with HIV in 2001. There were also  40 million people living with HIV/AIDS , among them 17,2 Million women, and 2,7 Million children under 15. This year, there were  3 Million AIDS deaths , among them 580.000 children.

        relationships: family  HIV is often an isolating disease. Despite efforts to educate the public about the fact that HIV is a virus and hence color-blind, culture-blind, orientation-blind and gender-blind, the stigma of the gay disease that  "you go out and work hard to get yourself"  remains.   People living with AIDS very often not only face the stigma of the disease itself, but also that of their sexual orientation, too. While the situation of the queer community has in general improved over the past decades, AIDS, without a doubt, has been a setback. When living in a GLBT love bubble (as I feel like I do) one can forget that many people still experience discrimination and hostility because of their orientation or being HIV positive, not only by strangers or government organisations or their health insurance, but even by their own families. Take a look at  urlLink The Letter Wars ; which the gay, HIV positive and partnered  urlLink Wes and Tom  have put online. The letters tell the story of the family quarrel that evolved when Wes announced that he would bring his partner of three years to a family convention. An aunt of his got rather intense with the homophobic bible waving argumentations, and after Wes tried hard to tackle her arguments with sound reasoning, she even claimed Tom (but not the also seropositive Wes) would be a risk for the other attendees of the family reunion, because she argued that HIV was transmitted through casual contact (note: only in Toms, not in Wes's case). The letters instantly reminded me of the letters in  urlLink Armistead Maupin's "More Tales of the City"  when Michael Tolliver (one of my fave characters from a book ever) writes a coming out letter to his fundamentalist parents in faraway Florida. And apparently  urlLink Wes recognized the similarity between his letters and Michaels letter, too.

        I caredo you?   I caredo you?  is the slogan for the  urlLink UNAIDS  World Aids Campaign 2001, the second year of a two year campaign intended to create a sustained focus on the role of men in the AIDS epidemic, as HIV infection is highestwith the exception of sub-saharan Africa- in men.    Some facts about men and HIV/AIDS  :   Approximately  one-quarter  of those living with HIV/AIDS are men  under 25 .  More than  70% of HIV infections worldwide are estimated to result from sex between men and women . Ten percent can be traced to sexual transmission between men, and 5% of infections are due to needle-sharing by people who inject drugs. Four out of five injecting drug users are men.  Studies show that when  young men lack sexual health education  (which can provide them with an understanding of their own bodies, pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections), they have an increased risk of contracting HIV. Many young people get their sexual health information from unreliable sources. Studies from countries as diverse as Cameroon, Costa Rica, the Philippines and Zimbabwe reveal that, while parents often provide young girls with some sexual health education (usually relating to menstruation and pregnancy), boys rarely receive any.  Most societies assign the role of breadwinner to men and confer special privileges upon both men and boys, compared to women and girls. These privileges often include the right to have sex outside of longer-term relationships or to engage in extra-marital relationships, which can increase the risk of HIV infection for both men and women.  In many societies, boys and young men are conditioned not to express their emotions, to maintain formal relationships with their children, and to use violence to resolve conflicts and maintain their "honor." Within the context of HIV and AIDS, such conditioning is particularly worrying since it reinforces the view that men do not have a caregiving role, and can result in behavior that places themselves and others at risk of HIV infection.      Some Ideas proposed include  :   Provide boys and young men with  information and life skills  that will enable them to ensure their reproductive health, based on wise, responsible choices -- choices that include abstinence and delayed sexual activity, as well as safer sex.   Train doctors  and health workers  to talk with their patients about sexual behavior , safer sex, and substance abuse, including injecting drug use and drinking.   Promote 100% condom use  among boys and young men beginning their sexual lives, since it is easier to maintain behavioral patterns that are learned early in life.  Promote the message that  condoms provide more pleasure because there is less worry  about HIV and other sexually transmitted infections, as well as pregnancy.  Provide facilities for  men-only sessions in clinics dealing with family welfare , reproductive health, and sexually transmitted infections. Gain the support of local community leaders in encouraging young men to attend.  Within the community, foster the attitude that  drunkenness is no excuse for unsociable behavior or unsafe sex .

        not a faceless disease: wilton  I never had to see a close friend die of AIDS, but I remember the first person that I actually *knew* who had AIDS -- he and his partner, who gave this virus, this disease a face for me -- very well. Every time I read the four letters  "A I D S"  I think of him. And I see his face. Wilton was a dancer at a musical where I used to hang out in my teens. He wasn't the first of the cast to be HIV positive, but he was the first person I saw sick, and it was unbearable to see him, a previously fit and healthy young chap, being unable to walk up 5 steps. The story of Wilton, and what seeing him sick meant to me, is a bit too long to be posted here, it can be read at Scarleteen though. So please take some time to hop over there to read   urlLink Not a faceless disease .

        HIV transmission and safer sex: basics   urlLink HIV is transmitted through body fluids  (blood, saliva, ejaculate or vaginal secretions or breast milk) through anal, vaginal and oral sex, through shared needles used for injecting IV drugs or accidental pricks with infected needles, through blood transfusions or blood products, childbirth or breastfeeding. The main transmission risk for HIV for the "average" person (not a drug user, not working in the medical field with contact to blood-borne pathogens) is obviously transmission through sexual contact. However, there is lots one can do to lower one's transmission risk: using condoms for vaginal, anal and oral sex at all times is the main pillar in HIV prevention. However, condoms only work when they are used correctly and consistently, and safer sex entails more than just using condoms. So how does one use condoms to start with, and what is  "Safer Sex in all its latex glory"  and what do you need for it? No matter for how many years you've been having sex: it can never harm to refresh your knowledge of the basics. So why not take some time to check out the urlLink Condom Manual  and the awesome  urlLink Safe, Sound & Sexy: How to bring Safer Sex to the bedroom without the Buzzkill ? I swear, after reading the latter, you will have arguments to counter everyone who ever proposes sex without condoms to you.    tools of the trade  When assembling your very own safer sex kit, I'd personally recommend  urlLink Saturn Larger fitting  or  urlLink Condomi premium  teamed up with  urlLink Pjur eros bodyglide . A review of  urlLink Kimono Microthins  (which many of my friends swear by),  urlLink InSpiral  and  urlLink Astroglide  is pending. Have the condoms here, but haven't had an opportunity to try them yet; and some astro should hopefully make its way across the Atlantic ocean to me soon. :) Having sex should be fun; so search for the perfect safer sex tools, and do lots of trying out.

       urlLink 19 year old student dies after giving birth in a dormitory bathroom.   It's events like this one that make me realize how very important giving  urlLink sex ed  to teens is, and how important it is that they have someone to talk to about sexuality and sexual health without having to fear rejection.  Feel incredibly sorry for Karen Hubbard. How horrible and lonely these past few months and those hours in the bathroom must have been. You know, I don't believe that someone can be several months pregnant and not *know* that she is. Yup, the mind is a powerful thing, but really, if you know  urlLink how reproduction works , you know when you've been at  urlLink risk of getting pregnant , you know when you're pregnant, at the latest when you've missed your period for a few months and are gaining weight. Hell, you feel a child  move  inside you. Even if Karen didn't  know  (for sure, that is) or hadn't realised that she was pregnant, she must have realised in the middle of *being sick* that she was giving birth. - But then, the entire experience was probably so surreal that she of course couldn't call out for help then. How desperate must she have been, 9 months pregnant, and giving birth in a dorm bathroom, without any help, after a pregnancy without pre-natal care. How horrible that her dorm mates believed her when she said that she was just *sick*. How horrible people let her alone in that bathroom stall for several hours. Had someone openend the door early on, she might have been ok after all.  Makes me all very sad.

      Life is slow, even though the days are basically just racing by. Dinner with H&S on Tuesday was nice & yummy (super delicious madras chicken curry), and Evan of course ruled the following game of  urlLink Settlers of Catan . :) He  had  took a day off yesterday, and we spend the day the way days you take off should be spend, I reckon, - not getting up until noon, long & late breakfast, CD shopping and coffee & cake & conversation in the afternoon.  Last night, another outbreak of sadness though. Lying next to him in bed, I just wished I could preserve the physical feeling somehow. Save it to c:// so that I could relive it in his absence whe3never needed, to feel and hear his breathing, feel his hipbone under my left hand, and his head in my left, and his warmness under the blanket. Cried a bit, both for the beauty and happiness of the moment, and for the sadness as I know and feel that I'll have to do without it come next Monday. What I fear most is waking up at night and searching for him, half-asleep.  But still. All is good right now, and I'll just have to work a bit harder to make things good next week. Really, I should keep in mind how good things are and how good things will soon be, and that we'll get through the next few months, if not easily, then at least better than we've gotten through the previous months apart.  *sigh*

        "The Lord of the Rings" by  Ernest Hemingway   "Frodo Baggins looked at the ring. The ring was round. It was a good ring. The hole at the heart of the ring was also round. The hole was clean and pure. The hole at the heart of the ring had an emptiness in it that made Frodo Baggins remember the big skies of the Shire when his father had taken him out and taught him to tear the heads off the small, furred things that walked there, even though he hated blood in those days and the stink of the blood was always part of the emptiness for him then and ever after...."     "The Lord of the Rings" by  A.A. Milne   "What we're going to do," said Frodo, "is we're going to go on an expotition."  "Ooh" said Pippin, "what will we discover?"  "We're not going to *discover* anything, Pippin, we're going to *undiscover* uncle Bilbo's old ring." "CAN you undiscover things?" asked Sam. "Discovering doesn't seem to be a thing you can UN-, if you know what I mean."  "Sam", said Frodo, sharpening his pencil, "You haven't any brain."  Sam shuffled off trying to look like he hadn't said anything, and that it was one of Frodo's many friends and relations. Frodo continued, "Anything that can be discovered, can be *undiscovered*, it stands to reason."     "Lord of the Rings" by  Meatloaf   "It was a hot summer's day in the Marsh of the Dead There was fog crawling over the swamp I could listen to the screams of the Dead Men Calling I could see their empty eyes and the candles blowing in the wind. You were licking your finger With the Ring of Power and I was dying just to ask for a taste We were dancing together up on the Crack of Doom And no-ones gonna know what we've done."    urlLink Alternative authors' versions of "Lord of the Rings" .  Yes, I am well aware that this is hardly funny unless you, too, are currently in the fangs of these 1500 or whatever pages. Evan reckons that reading that book has unfortunately advanced me to a higher level of geekness. Or whatnot. Hehe. Take that as a compliment anyway. :) In addition (and maybe best of all), it has given me a new male being to fantasize about. Oh, Aragorn, oh Aragorn.

      Official Start of OurLastWeekTogether.  Have started the CryingForNoSpecificReason thing already. It sucks muchly. Find myself shedding tears not just in all the usual moments (during/after cozy talk, cuddling, love-making, wandering through town, waking up in the middle of the night) but just from seeing him sitting at the PC playing Speedball2 or standing in the kitchen doing the dishes. Yes, our coupled up life is oh so very romantic.  I really wanted to try hard not to start this all round sobbing thing again, because, quite honestly, things are simply much to good, especially if I take a good look at the past and compare our current situation with what it was like the previous times we had to part ways. Really, we've moved past the "is this right/do we want to do this" thing that troubled us the first few times. But -quite contrary to what stupid little me expected- knowing you want to be with that person but can't (yet) because there is stuff you need to get done with first just makes this goodbye thing -even if you know you that there will, in the not too distant future, come a time when you will not be seperated by a couple of continents- more difficult.  Anyway. I really don't want to think about this all too much. All way too present already, I can already grasp how much it will hurt to not have him here with me. I can feel the emptiness opening up inside of me. Sounds terribly pretentious, I know.  The weekend wasn't much of a success, btw. Not because of the impending departure or because of the shitty mood I had been in all day Friday, but because it just didn't quite work out the way we had thought it would. The party we had long planned to go to on Saturday, root down @ waldsee, the monthly residency of  urlLink DJ Rainer Trueby , turned out to simply suck. Big time. Not only did it cost a hefty 10, which I'd be willing to pay for a professionally organised, excellent night, but it was more than they had informed us it would when I had inquired by phone last week, plus the japanese DJ Trüby had teamed up with played a set that was basically just really bad uninventive badly played drum & bassy techno crap - nothing I would spend a cent to listen to. In addition, Evan was more than just a wee bit surprised about the location, as this legendary party takes place in a old unpretty little Pub with an attached concrete floor room and is just very dilettantly organised, and the crowd wasn't to our liking either. Too young & too serious about the crappy music & not at all enthusiastic. Was just all rather strange. As if that wasn't enough already, Evan had a massive bout of what -on Sunday morning- turned out to be a migraine, so at 1:30, we decided to walk home. Duh. Thanks for the lovely night. Thanks to the aforementioned migraine, Evan spend Sunday mostly asleep, while I lay next to him on the bed and continued to make my way through "The Two Towers". It really wasn't a bad weekend (successfully shopped for CDs & an mp3 playing discman), just nothing at all like we expected it to be.  Today shall be a normal Monday, I s'pose. Strange how I've settled into rituals these past weeks. Have spend the morning doing the laundry, will later study a bit, clean the place and do the ironing (all the while grabbing mp3s from Evans CDs), and when he comes home, we'll do our shopping, expecting guests (the newly married german/aussie LDR couple) for dinner tomorrow, so I guess we will make a little expedition to the larger/cheaper out of town supermarket.  Geez, we're so very domestic, indeed.

For a good 5 minutes I pondered whether I should scream, or simply cry. An apology later made it better, but still.  I shall wear a  "beware. bites."  sign around my neck.

      Sidenote re: mood.  As discussed with Tina earlier today, I think my hair length is in direct correlation with my mood swings. The longer (and out of control and flapping in my face) my hair is, the more easily you can get me into mood swing hell. Same goes for my flat. The dirtier this place is, the easier you can piss me off.Squeaky clean floors and a nice smelling bathroom lift me up.  Yup, sounds like a control thing to me, too.  As I don't have the  to get my hair nice and blonde and cut this week and am a couple of hundred km's away from the one person who is allowed to get near my hair with scissors, a decent cleaning session in my bathroom shall do tomorrow. Using straightening conditioner should make life a bit easier, too.  *sigh*

      What has happened to make my mood what it is at the moment, I have no idea.  Self-bashing programme running well again in my head. Typical. Tell Caro  "no matter how hard I try, it is never enough for your standards" , and voilá, see Caro curled up in a fetal position, crying. It is the one sentence (aside of:  "you sure you can wear that, considering how fat you are" , when being said by my brother) that hits me right were all the bad self perception things usually do their work on my ego anyway.  It really was bizarre last night, and the worst is that it was my fault that it turned out the way it did. All out of a sudden, my mind turned on the self hating mode, and instantly made me feel ugly/disgusting/unloveable/undesirable that all I could think was  "he doesn't want this with me anyway and absolutely must hate it" . Nothing quite like that assumption to ruin mood. Later, I felt alone and hurt, while nothing negative had been said or done by anyone. Was my mind alone ruining the moment (and evening). Nice.  I really don't know why they happen, these dramatic "mood swings". It's like someone turns a switch in my head, and -boom!- I get extremely self-consicous, way overboard. Or I start getting super irritated by things that aren't in order. On a perfectly fine day coming home from a couple of hours in town having fun CD shopping with Ev a dirty kitchen and/or unmade bed and/or dirty bathroom can get me into self-hating and ruining the day mode instantly. Yes, I, too think that this sounds absolutely ridiculous. If I am happy, why do I have to worry about dirty showers and dishes? It really shouldn't matter, quite simply. It really doesn't matter, in the grand scheme of things, I think.  Why is my mood such a fragile little thing? Hate it. Hate myself, just for the day.  Sidenote: Wrote to the guest-to-be that we didn't have room for her. Even though I did give reasons. But then, at least I said no. Can someone please give me a pat on the back for that? Please?

       eMail about 5 minutes ago from someone who was invited to our place by last weeks guest to join us at a party this Saturday (yes, I too think that something is wrong with that scenario), yet called on Monday to say she wouldn't come. A call to which I faked a bit of sadness, yet was of course very relieved.    "Managed to get lots done this past few days and think I can come to F. Would it be okay if I arrive on Friday at 11? Is there any room at your place for me?"    Fucking NO.   So how can I say that almost nicely? Or is it important that I say it nicely? Should I do as my shrink told me to yesterday aka simply say "No" without any reasons (even though there are enough of them) to not give any chance in her fighting my reasons?  argh.

        Well, well. These days have been passing by way too quickly. Truly a Tina-like  "unbeliiiieeeevable"  worthy.  All last week, while I was residing in lack of estrogen and (as  urlLink kitto  put it so well almost a year ago) evil-elves-with-spiky-boots-are-dancing-in-my-uterus-hell, Evan and I had the pleasure of being this town's cheapest backpacker hostel yet again. Gah. The gal that stayed over this time and that wanted to be entertained was a friend from Oz, nice gal, really, but with the poorest timing ever and no sensor for Evan and I maybe needing some private time, too. When she didn't manage to get hold of the person she wanted to meet next on Wednesday, the only thing she said was:  "So I'll be staying another day then." . No  "would it be okay if I?"  No,  "I hope you don't mind that" . Or whatever else. Was very stressful, no matter how nice she usually is. It's just not nice not having any privacy at all when you are feeling shitty. Add to that the fact that these are the last few weeks that Evan and I have... Oh well. Invasion time is over (and I hope it will stay that way for the rest of the time we have), and some bits were nice: made a trip over the border to Colmar, where we purchased the best cake that ever touched my lips. Strongly recommend the produce of the Patisserie "Jean" (Rue de Boulangers, Colmar). Especially the "Truffette". Worth every cent at 2.50 a small piece. Yum. I now know where my wedding cake shall be made. If I ever get married that is.  To counter the invasion we had to endure all week, Friday and Saturday were spent in blissful coupledom and domesticness (*sigh*), whereas Sunday was a blur of social activities to make up for all that twosomeness, meeting people for breakfast, someone else for coffee and yet someone else for beer, and arrangement that turned into dinner. I still can't grasp how well we have settled into a routine, and how enjoyable and good it all is.  A lot really is well for me, while Bad stuff seems to be happening to many dear ones. Strange situation to be in. Am trying to send loving vibes and energy their way, while I got more than enough of it. - Give more than I take for once, while it lasts. For I know that all will be different in two weeks time.  Last night, I got the first bout of he-will-be-leaving-soon-sadness. - Not nice at all. I really don't want to get all gloomy about the nearing end of this lovely time, but lying next to him last night, I already felt a wee bit of the heartache that I know I will feel once he's hopped on that plane to Thailand. All was just so normal, yet blissful and nice, that I just realised that I want to feel that way *all* the time. Nope, I know that I shouldn't be surprised. I've known that all along, haven't I?.  In any way: Life is good, apart from my motivation to study, which sucks, which shouldn't surprise me either. Doesn't help that I am just finishing "Fellowship of the Ring", can't put the stupid book away and am dying to know what will happen to Aragorn (*swoon*) and am absolutely turning into a Lord of the Rings geek. I knew something had been missing from my life. Told Evan last night, while in the middle of falling asleep (a time when I usually come up with rather funky things to say), that it was good he was sleeping on the side of the bed that doesn't face the wall for he could take better watch in regards to orcs from there. He. :)   I wish things would simply stay the way they are at this very moment.

      Feeling  PM e S sy and really need some lone time but have yet another visitor staying at my place and hence still no time for an online life and/or studying and/or taking stock and/or finally getting back to normal.  Not good at all.  Growl.  Thanks for all those lovely notes though, you lit up my day. And Aria, please, no kidding with these things! :)

      Looking better (the scratch on my forehead looks like Tasmania, my eyes are white again, and I am wearing make up, too!), and feeling better, too, despite my emotions hitting rock bottom last night (and this morning, too) for no apparent reason, not even a hormonal one.  Was very strange. All out of a sudden, in the middle of recording a tape for Tina with Evan (a glorious, glorious tape, I might add), it was as if someone turned a switch, and at once, my mood was low. It wasn't something Ev said, it was no song, it was nothing. Some stuff later said and done that night, tiny tiny little things, seemed to contribute to my feeling of shittiness, but really, that didn't start it. I really should stop over-reacting, even in my head, to comments such as  "I saw that play with xy"  or to his concern in regards to my studies or whatever else. I should simply just stop. Very strange. I just want my emotions (at least the bad ones) under control, please.  Prolly just need some good loving, like spending a bit chunck of the weekend in bed. Or something. That plan won't materialize I guess, Ev, Tina, Jim and I, we'll be heading on a little touristy excursion to  urlLink Heidelberg , the one German city everyone on a Europe in 7 days bus tour visits. Of course we won't go there with a busload of American tourists (even though I am sure we'll meet them there), but with a cheapo little  urlLink Happy-Weekend Train ticket  which will bring the priece of the excursion down to 7 each. Nice.  Right now, just waiting for Jim to hop by, second weekend in a row in town for him to see Tina. Geez, and I am to blame. I hate it when things work out when you set people up. :) Ev hopefully has a short day at the hospital, too, so we might simply hit the Siedler board for the time being, and will - in a joint coupley effort- try to win against Jim. Hehe.  Anyway. More soonish, I think. Am not in the mood for being online much, but when I am online, I keep missing the icq people - still no time to catch up with Kitto, Brianna, Linnie or Heather. Not good. If you read this: hopefully soon. Miss you, really.

      weeeh.  I can't bear to look at me in the mirror.  Not only am I still sneezing and coughing so badly that people in public turn away from me in disgust (second bout of the common cold in 4 weeks), not only do I have a hideous scratch on my forehead (obtained during an accident when playing with the toyboy), not only is my skin in turmoil and peri-oral dermatitis hell, No, that apprently isn't enough as I now also have to abstain from eye make-up (which might help in making me look any good at all) as my eyes are according to my doc, super dry and irritated and red and without enough tears. Yay.  I want to look pretty. Geez, I am feeling so good emotionally, why in all the world don't I look the part, too?  Ick. Ick. Ick.  Need vitamins and water.

       Sidenote:  Sad moment of the day: My favourite music channel, viva 2, has been killed and replaced with  urlLink this , a channel filled with ugly, overstyled unbearable hosts. Sob. Sob. Sob.  In addition, I just realised that  urlLink Opendiary  finally deleted my old diary there, despite my recent efforts of keeping it there, just for the sake of it (being my first writings online and all). Sob.  Am observing a minute of silence.

      So where shall I start?  I like 2002 so far. A lot. New Years was a blast, far better than most New Year's that I've had. Finally had enough time to really get to know Amsterdam, and that rocked. We stayed at the legendary  urlLink Flying Pig , which truly lived up to its reputation and was ok for three nights and the price we paid for our beds in a 22 people dorm. Extra special Entertainment Add-On were the other guests, which all seemed to be about 19 and of English speaking origin and to had come to Amsterdam to get stoned out of their heads and spend their days lying on the pillow covered love nest in the hostels entrance area, lulling the few brain cells they call their own to minimum function via the use of Marihuana products.  One female guest from Canada, who was blessed with good looks, which were neutralised with the most annoying voice on earth, excitedly shared a true scientific  discovery with a fellow traveller one morning in the downstairs breakfast room   "man, you know, i realised something the other day! when I am high, I really have trouble reading. man, i read one page and have forgotten everything straight away! think i should give up reading while in amsterdam."   Lovely. Listening to that classic piece of true scientific brilliance, we almost all spat out our coffee in laughter. I don't know, but there is something about that place (the residue of THC in the walls maybe?) that makes your language deteriorate until you can only utter sentences of the quality of "Man, that was some good weed!". All very teenage. Having been there done that at the ripe age of 15, I felt a bit out of place really, and couldn't help but laugh most of the time. What's the point in flying thousands of miles and crossing oceans just to lie for several days on the dirty pillows of a hostel being high instead of enjoying an awesome city with awesome museums and places and cafes? Anyway. They all seemed to enjoy themselves, so who am I to judge?  Our little group was blessed with a brief visit by two "friends" from Melbourne who just wanted to get high, too. These unfriendly, uncommunicative individuals hadn't got a clue as to what is involved in the process of rolling a joint, so Tina and I were nice, and - pretty much drunk and partied out at 4am on New Years Day- managed to roll a perfect fat torch like joint in the middle of Leidseplein only to give them something that would shut them up for a while. The things you do in Amsterdam, I guess.  We did more things that "you do when in Amsterdam", too. The museum visits (sloooowly passing by van Goghs paitings), a grachten tour (for those who had never been to Amsterdam before and during which I fell asleep because sitting next to my boy in the sun felt so nice), long strolls along grachten at day and nighttime (which involved snow fights, too), a walk through the red light district (which left me a bit startled, simply because this was the first time I realised how young most of the sex workers working there are, and how completely not erotic or sexy the atmosphere there is by my definitions), lovely long talks at various bruine cafe's and short nights. Added into that package was excitement about the new currency and whether our funds would last throughout the ATM shut down. So odd to hold the first new money in hand: perfect, clean little bills and unscratched shiny coins that worked on both sides of the border. These are new times, people, I swear. I also discovered how absolutely adorable dutch is, and felt this sudden urge to start really learning it. Feels so strange in my mouth to speak it, but geez, you simply understand so much simply by knowing german and english, it would be a shame to not give it a try.  To fulfill the cliches of backpacking, we even had Maccas at a Gracht one day (simply to save money for the days real dinner), purchased large amounts of alcohol which were all consumed, and walked along the streets on New Years, singing. All nice.  Our little group was well made up of Tina, Evan, Santa and Peter (two friends of Evans that had visited us here in F before Christmas), Jim (a good mate of Evan) and Ollie and Sameer, both fellow Med Students of Evs. All worked out well, until the usual discussion about what to do on New Years arose and I strongly disagreed with going to an organised party that would cost a meagre 40  (money I can buy food of for a week, money another member of the group spends without thinking twice), a little disagreement which quite nicely culminated at 6pm on NY's eve when someone said rude things to Evan about me instead of discussing matters with me. Great timing. Great childish style. In any way, New Years was spend not at that party, but first warming up at the Pigs Pub, moving on to the Dam to see the fireworks and then to a Cafe/Pub at Leidseplein, where we danced the night away and Tina and I were drooled on lots. Had it not been for Evan and Jim, we would have had trouble getting out of there alive, I guess. Hehe. A lot of fun.  Ah, yes, Jim. More correctly: Jim and ...Tina. What can I say? Evan and I had long planned to set these two up, and boy did it work well, once they finally met. Actually, as I write this, Jim is here in F, visiting Tina, so...all is well in that respect, too, I guess, even though I cannot help but feel guilty about it all, too. Were it not for Evan and me, I doubt they would think twice about trying the LDR thing, now it looks like they might give it a shot, and I am not sure what to say or do or think about this. Oy.  Anyway. These are the Amsterdam Tales. To follow next (after cleaning me, the floors, and the bathroom): Christmas, kneeling while giving your partner little blue boxes that hold jewellery and why you shouldn't give phones as presents. :)

      I kept the computer turned off ever since I returned home, simply because I was quite happy living in computer free wonderland (or when a computer was near without links to my favourites) for a wee little while. However, I was on icq and blog cold turkey, and well knowing what would happen once I turned my computer on, I waited with getting back into a net routine until I had some lone time to hopefully catch up with everyone quickly.  The net and RealLife got me back, I reckon, the toyboy has his first day at the hospital today, and before I hop back into the hell that doing law is (and the procrastination that being online while you should be studying is), I have a whole day pretty much alone to do housekeeping stuff such as doing laundry, ironing, cleaning the bathroom, purchasing food (not that I know how to pay for that yet) and dusting. Yay. All that while I feel rather shitty, as somehow I have again managed to get yet another virus, virus number 6 in a 4 week period. Yay to that, too. I need to be able to afford a decent multi-vitamin again.  In a way, being alone right now is kinda nice, on the other hand, I know now, that the funky days of doing nothing of importance to anyone but you and your beloved one are over. Bummer.  More soon, including tales of Amsterdam, the sweetness of being partnered and the sweetness of setting people up, soon.  Everyone: thanks for your lovely notes during my absence. So nice.  Saigonsam:  As unbelievable as it sounds, Tina and I didn't take any photos of us clad in tarty shirts. Shocking. Am afraid you need to trust the judgement of a stoned bartender at the  urlLink Flying Pig :  "Maaaaan, you two girls are hot!"   Roel : Coffee next time? :)

      am drooling all over my keyboard, in a freshly ignited aragorn frenzy: spent my afternoon watching  urlLink lord of the rings  for a second time.  boy, was it worth it, was it worth it.  got so much more out of it this time. woah. watching it for the first time sparked an interest in me, the former tolkien hater; watching it a second time gave me a chance to really appreciate peter jackson's work. and: woah.   the movie jackson made is the only movie that could have been made out of tolkien's epic. it's just as pretentious and grandiose as the book and so many of the metaphors and imagery used by tolkien has been excellently transferred. so much of the critique i came across these past weeks really is unfounded: the adaptation of the script, the exclusion of the songs, the violence: who cares? i don't. yup, would have been nice to see tom bombadill, to put more structure into the hobits journey, but no one can honestly suggest that the movie was ruined because arwen brought frodo to rivendell or because the songs were left out (that would have turned the thing into  "lord of the rings - the musical" . ridiculous). same goes for any critique  regarding the fighting scenes and the violence: the movie is as violent and gruesome as the book (the only difference being these attractive  pffffft!  sounds orcs make when hit by an arrow. he.). if you read the book and don't feel that way, you either didn't imagine the fighting scenes while reading them, or missed like two thirds of the books.  in general, i felt so "in the know": so good to see all those little glimpses of places all over middle earth (barad-dur, morrannon, minas tirith, whatnot) and *know* where they are, what has and what will happen there (especially nice in Isengard: oh how i can not wait to see the ents destroying the place); to see people and know who they are, know their motivations and hence being able to fully enjoy the film without having to listen extra well to not miss any hints and details. gave me the chance to completely enjoy and appreciate the cinematography. oh it was so good, despite the full cinema, the pricey  ticket and me being alone.  best thing of course was being able to completely concentrate on not missing a thing aragorn did in those lovely 180 minutes. the only time i breathed was during the break. :)  i so can not wait for part ii & iii. more aragorn. a happy-end with him and arwen. awww.

      any run in nina's nylons made my day.  nina was a classmate in  high school. she had a spanish mother and hence been blessed with good genes making her almost 6ft tall, slender, giving her a perfect olive toned complexion and stunningly shiny dark hair. she was one of them. a member of the  "always perfect looking women"  club. you know the kind.  runs in nina's stockings, which were a rare occurence (she was obviously not like me who just needs to look at nylons and make them get runs), gave me the illusion that she was somehow like the  "rest of us" , too.  you could put nina into torn up jeans and an old jumper, put her hair up with a pencil and throw paint all over here (she was good at arts, you know), or in a short skirt and tight shirt and no matter what, she always looked terribly terribly beautiful. perfect. immaculate. everything was always right about her. her skirts were never too short. her shirts never too tight, she never looked sloppy or slutty (whatever that means in high school slang) or over the top. she was just always right, and had a highly developed sense of what suited her and what didn't. she looked effortless. simple. easy.  i envied her terribly. to some extend i still do. - not just nina, all women of that  "club" . i have trouble dealing with beautiful, tall women with an easy sense of style. - they are all something that i am not.  take a look at me. thick mousy hair (when not highlighted and thinned for an insane amount of ), strange skintone. not tall at all. big hips and legs (must have been good when my ancestors still worked on the fields, bad now when trying to shop for pants). big breasts. i always look wrong, out of shape, mix-matched. i never look casual, never easy, always made up. let me illustrate: if i do the casual thing, slacks, a plain t-shirt, a sweater round my shoulders, i look sloppy or plain. if i do the more formal route, a shirt, nice pants, i always end up looking too formal or like i never belonged in these clothes in the first place. if i try doing something "hip" (the word alone makes me shudder) i look like i forgot to change out of my mardi gras costume. i look okay in underwear, naked, or wrapped in a blanket. - but put me in pants or anything else and -  woop!  - ugly.  the harder i try to look good when dressed, the worse the result. no wonder, really.   i think the real reason behind this i that i am just not sure what i want to look like, what looks good on me, what i should look like, however you want to put it.  for years (for all my life, probably), i tried to look "like them" and use clothing as an entry ticket into acceptance. most of the time, highly unsuccesfully.  had my first little flirt with style terrorism right when changed to high school (which happens over here at the ripe age of 10): benetton, esprit and chevignon were the tommy hilfingers of the day, and big names a must on sweat shirts. i was lonely, didn't know anyone at the new school and harrassed my parents into buying me too expensive sweat shirts, honestly believing that that would help in finding friends. when i had my goth-rasta-punk-hippie-modette phase, clothing was a way to stand out and say  "i am different"  and it was important to have real authentic 70's clothes, the right shoes, whatnot. style terrorism wise, the "alternative" scene was as bad as any scene i'd come across beofre or would come across later. in high school, my second hand suede jackets (then supposedly "hip") made me look like i had rummaged through my grandfathers closet (which i had), and not hip at all. someone else must have liked the jacket and deemed it (not me) hip enough though: it was stolen one day in school. the highlight in style terrorism were my first two years at uni, though, when i tried to convince myself that i, too, enjoyed wearing blue blouses and little hankies round my neck each and every day and deemed burberry check the best fabric for a little skirt suit.  it was all terribly shallow. terribly terribly shallow. it made me feel terrible because i never felt at home in my skin. nor in my second skin, my clothes.  when i gave up on shallowness 2 years ago (you know, the thing that sparked me to fall into the throes of clinical depression) and rid my life of a good amount of superficiality, mainly in the form of people who were overly interested in what label your jacket had, i also lost direction somehow. i removed lots of badness from my life but didn't add new goodness. or at least something to wear. i failed to re-invent myself on many levels. and really, it's about time i get that done.  at the moment, i need a whole bunch of new clothes (mainly because what i own is mostly too big for me these days), yet i stand in the shops clueless as to what i want and am looking for. i try things on and most of the time feel misplaced and wrong. it's just no fun. even when i don't try on real clothes, looking at myself in clothes is a great way to ruin my mood.  friday night,  urlLink kitto  and i wasted some time using  urlLink "virtual models"  of ourselved to try on a  certain kind of dress  at a  urlLink website  i should be smacked for visiting in the first place.  it was horrific. there's been quite a bit of talk about "my virtual model" at plenty of diaries in the past, and i don't quite feel like saying it all again, but let me just add that this thing helped put a nice new twist on my already warped body view. no fumbling with sizing helped make that "model" look like me: the  "big breasts, big thighs"  thing simply wasn't an option. any weight you added to the "model" was added on the waist, which simply isn't the way that i am built. in addition, the gowns you could put on your sick looking models sucked, too.  as a result, my virtual model looked like a ton. fat and sad and just not right. but then, as i never look  "right" , never have and (unless someone sends me to a make-over) probably never will, i guess my virtual model was quite accurate and well done after all.  i try to remind myself that it's just clothes, that they don't really matter in the grande scheme of things and that people like me no matter what. i wish i could not care, feel undisturbed by what i am wearing, not think about make up and just be me, whoever that is. but it's not working.  i want clothes that make me feel at home and let me put my energy on worrying about important things. but it ain't working, and i still feel inferior to women who are members of the club. which is a terribly sexist (or whatever -ism) thing, i reckon, and such a sign of my bad self-esteem.  all just such a waste of time. wish i could walk around in chantelle bras and thongs all day. that would make life more comfortable. at least for me.

      evan suggested today that i do one thing this weekend that i've been wanting to do for ages, something to pamper me. and i couldn't come up with a single thing that i would enjoy, that would make me happy. he suggested that i get a professional massage, which is an excellent idea, but not realisable on a weekend. too bad: i could do with an hour of lying on a table getting all the locked up feelings massaged out of my muscles.  just what is it about weekends since he's away that makes me so sad? am just not used to loneliness and quiet anymore which make room for all my negative thoughts to come back. so hate it. so hate them. so not want to be where i am at the moment.

        re: truth in advertisment.  Noticed this last night: How ridiculous is it to try to pretend that Marshmallows are any good by writing "naturally fat free" on the bag?  The white fluffies are made of gelantine, two kinds of sugar and a wee bit starch. Where should any fat come from?  "Naturally Nutrient-free" would prolly be a more honest thing to write on the packaging.

      Just received an eMail from one of the "kids" my friend xan and I looked after as part of the aussie-german student exchange program back in 1998/99. He broke the news that he just get engaged to his partner and didn't think he could be happier until his partner had a renal ultrasound plus the following conversation last week:   Nurse : "Is there any chance you could be pregnant?"  gal : "Pffft no of course not..."  Nurse : "Well...  *points scan to pelvis, turns monitor to gal...*   gal : "Oh fuck".  despite that immediate reaction, they are both elated now, and he wrote that while she is preggie symptom free, he feels quite pregnant, indeed.  Am happy for them, if in shock, too. Strange. Could we do that, too, Evan and me - be parents?

       urlLink Friday Five!    1. Hey, baby, what's your sign? Do you think it fits you pretty well?   urlLink cancer . And well, depends. I am not *as* homey as all horoscopes think cancers should be. That  "emotional, intuitive, moody, withdrawing"  thing however: yep.   2. What's the worst birthday gift you've ever received?  In 1997, my ex-partner gave me a book I had told him I had always hated as a kid.   3. What's the best birthday gift you've ever received?  A flight to Australia from my parents. It counted for several birthdays and a christmas, btw.   4. What's the best way you've celebrated your birthday thus far?  My 18th birthday was kinda nice, celebrated at a wild movie worthy house party in New Zealand which involved people destroying the kitchen, the shower stall, the carpet in the living room and doing nasty things to the households pets. Thankfully it wasn't my party or my house or my pets, and I wasn't the one so drunk that I shaved my hair off completely. He. In honor of my birthday, some friends of mine did a haka. It was lovely. :)   5. What are your plans for this weekend?  Working Out. Soppy phone calls. Maybe some packing for my trip home next week...nothing exciting at all yet.

      so where did this week go? somehow, time rushes past, yet somehow it seems like february is neverending. i think my sense of time is a bit warped at the moment. am feeling very in between. and all the good things from just a month ago seem like they happened in the last century. or whenever.  with all that running to the computer store three times a day, some studying and waiting for 4 minutes to see whether that wee little window would stay pink or not, time just ran past. spent yesterday morning at  urlLink profa  explaining to beate, an intern i hadn't met yet, how to make information sharing easier for the center. she's building an intranet now, and needed advice on file organisation, which is one of the things i really am not too bad at.  hurried to micheil after those three intense hours to say goodbye and help him get his stuff to the train station. i think he really felt like it was time for him to return to australia but was sad about leaving germany, his flatmates, his life here behind, too: he jumped from excited to sad and back within minutes until i threatened to take his ticket and go to australia in his place if he got any gloomier about leaving. :) i didn't feel too sad really, am getting pretty matter of factly in regards to these saying goodbye to people from oz thing. i know i'll see micheil in a few months, and it's so odd that i know there are tons of good people i know and like and enjoy spending time with down there. australia doesn't seem that far away right now, a feeling i know will change at the latest when i've been sitting in a dreaded plane for a good 12 hours, stare at that flight monitor and asia seems to never end.  no matter what, i would have loved to be in micheils place yesterday. surprise, he?  however, i am actually not too sad right now. still, i miss the toyboy terribly, so much that it hurts to be without him, but it is bearable, because love oozes out of every corner of my computer/monitor/outlook express every time i open an eMail from him. it's unbelievable, really, all that talk about the future&#153, all these grand words - and they are bloody real&#153. the idea that he wants to be with me, even though he knows all my nasty sides and flaws and whatever else, wants to be with me not just for now, but for real&#153, is truly overwhelming. strangely enough, the idea that i want to be with him, spend my life with him (as cheesy as that sounds) never seemed that grande to me.  feels so good to be loved.

        GoodThings today :    Having my files back.  Oh, how I love them all. My mp3s. My photos. My diary. Everything. Feels  oh so very good . From now on: back up. I promise.  90 minutes à 4,5 cent to Melbourne, Australia.  For some strange reason, I feel terribly, terribly loved today.(Or was it simply the eMail this morn?)  One pink window instead of two.  For you deliver me from worry,  urlLink Femtest , and calm my over-working mind, pricey little test stick with the extra safety window telling me when the result is definite and I can start breathing again. Thank you. I swear, this must be answering in  urlLink Ask a Sexpert  again, infecting my brain with images of the highly unlikely. Or let's blame the estrogens I'm taking to not fall in suicidal pms for making my withdrawal bleed all strange. (Now that was more about my cycle than you ever felt like knowing, hm?) Or maybe it's just a ritual, the MidFebruaryPregnancyTest, a yearly acknowledging of the fact that there is always a risk, no matter how small. Anyway. For now, I can postpone surfing  urlLink HipMama  and stop wondering about the exact cost of an abortion (and from where I would get that money) for the next few (non partnered sex life) months.  All so very strange, that NaturalThillOfYourOwnFertility.

      I'm late. But then my puter was dead. So here go the  urlLink Friday Five :   1. What was the first thing you ever cooked?  Scrambled eggs.   2. What's your signature dish?  Lasagna, which I can only cook at other people's places, because I have no full size oven. Evan prolly regards my simple pasta with tomato sauce and mozzarella as my signature dish.   3. Ever had a cooking disaster? (tasted like crap, didn't work, etc.) Describe.  Preparing the aforementioned Lasagna at my rents place while I had  urlLink some   urlLink guests , I enthusiastically put grated cheese on top, right out of the sealed bag I had purchased it in. Only to discover once I had emptied the entire contents of the bag on it that the cheese had already gone green and moldy. Yum. Scaped it off as good as possible and in the absence of other real cheese, put kraft slices on top. It sucked. Muchly.   4. If skill and money were no object, what would make for your dream meal?  Strange question. Skill and money are rarely an object anyway, simply because I'm willing to give anything a try (I strongly believe in my ability to learn new meals) and because things that are terribly expensive don't really appeal to me in the first place. What I consider most when cooking is: can I cook this in on my two flames? A meal I want to try soon is a roast with tons of herbs out of "The Naked Chef".   5. What are you doing this weekend?   Among other things, I missed my computer, cleaned my flat, went to the  urlLink movies  and talked to my toyboy on the phone.

      Got my computer back, and the baby is working quite nicely again, even though I need to adjust to the tiny little changes.  However, turning him on, I had to discover that  ALL MY FILES WEREN'T THERE . A brief, albeit intense panic came over me, and I called the repair shop and calmly inquired as to what happened to them (because, like Bobo commented, a motherboard mishap should not endanger the content of the harddrive in any way) and -like expected- found out the idiots had forgotten to put the  not quite PG-13 and intensely personal  content of "caro's files" back where they belong and had kept them on their computersystem were my files rested while they worked on the hardware. I was offered to either drag my computer back to them, or to pick my files up on CD-Rom tomorrow. Opted for the latter, not just because dragging the baby through town just sucks, but also because having my files as of Thursday on CD-ROM once and for all isn't too bad of a start of having some -you know- back up.  Feels strange, this empty computer. I can't wait to get my files back. Still missing my Radiohead mp3's.

      That aside, I am okay and had a lovely social weekend so far. Computer Cold Turkey ain't nice, though. Longed so much for  Radiohead live that I almost bought the CD today, even though I have it all on mp3.  Not having my computer there forced me to spend my time productively which indeed worked out: cleaned the windows, tidied up, gave me a pedicure, cooked a real meal just for me. All important things, if less important than finally getting my site up (which is what  I would have done if my motherboard hadn't imploded). Might have him back as soon as Monday though, not all is lost. And the baby will be faster then, too! Yay.  Good news of the day: the toyboy is already back in Australia, after an odyssee of trying to get his ticket changed.  Had a little phone call today, and it was lovely to hear him properly, and to know he was feeling good and  happy.  More phone calls tomorrow, I hope. He's further away now, but as strange as it is, it feels closer, simply because I can now picture again what his life is like. Hope the lovey-doveyness we had will stay though, even though he isn't in Thailand anymore. I've gotten used to that much attention already. And boy, do I like it! :)  That much for this weekend (Internet Cafe closed on Sundays). Off to the movies,  urlLink Memento  tonight.

       Bloody HELL!   My computer experienced a major meltdown for inexplicable reasons last night (which sparked me to run around my flat screaming and crying for an hour). I carried my baby to the puter shop to have him checked out: The guy in the computer shop asked me just what info on my hard drive was important....and I could just reply "ALL".  I don't even want to think about how long it will take to get all my software back.... :( or what it would be like if all my files were lost.  I really shouldn't even think about it. In any way: less from me until I have my baby back, which should be mid next week. *sob sob*

       Did you know there is a womanly offence greater than body odour or bad breath?   No? - Neither did I, until  urlLink Kitto  showed me which 1950's ad she wanted to review for her "Images of Women in the Media" class.  urlLink An ad for "Zonite", a douching product  - for  "newer feminine hygiene!"  In case you didn't know: pussy smells bad! So bad that other people notice! So bad that your partner doesn't want to have sex with you! So bad that your marriage breaks up!  The ads are insane, yet in their insanity quite entertaining. Sort of like the entertainment you get from reading the  White Supremacists Dating Tips : the lunatic line of argumentation is so obvious that all you can do -instead of getting enraged- is being amused.  The basic line of argumentation is that female genitals are, by default, ugly and offensively smelly. To get rid of that smell -which other people might notice ( I wonder how, really: Did people in the 1950's regularly smell each other's crotches as part of saying hello? ), they recommend douching  "for hygiene, charm, health and happiness" . As if douching would make pussys happy. It's just the opposite, really: Nothing quite like douching to make sure that your pussy is unhappy and that the delictate balance of bacteria that make up the excellently working yet delicate vaginal self-cleaning system is out of sync. Healthy pussys don't smell. Pussys who've been stripped of their normal bacteria do. Can we all say Yeast Infection?  I really wonder how uncomfortable it must have been for the poor Zonite trusting wifes in 1953. - Trying to make their "smelly" pussies nice, the more they tried, the worse it must have got. The  "world famous surgeon and scientist"  was obviously lacking some basic knowledge about the female body when he suggested squishing anti-bacterial solution into vaginas.   Apart from advocating an unhealthy practise (which isn't too different from today's SlimFast or Diet Supplement ads), what strikes me as especially bad about these ads is the general suggestion that  a)  the love of your partner depends on your "clean" pussy; and  b)  that you are to blame when he (you know women always have male partners, right?) looses interest in sex. Oh, and  c)  as a result, it's your fault, too, when your marriages fails because of the lack of sex.  What a burden on women and their genitals. - So big a burden that 1950's women frantically shot up something "powerfully effective yet positively non-poisonous" into their vaginas. Quite sad, hm? The only sadder thing I know are all the women taking phen-fen like dietary supplements ending up with heart failure, just for the sake of being thin. One might expect women to have learned how to look through all the phony advertising and withstand it after 50 years of female abuse in advertising. - But nothing much has changed, if you look at the ads in your average cosmo-type magazine.  We haven't come a long way here ladies, at all.

      No comment from me. At least not in guestbooks, comments or on message boards.  Somehow, I just don't feel like commenting and advice giving at the moment. Nor like blind repeating of what several people have already posted.  Over these past months, I slowly but surely stopped leaving comments at other people's blogs. - Not because I don't read their sites any more, don't care or don't like what they write; I am still there, read and  admire their writing, but at the moment I just don't feel like I have the right to comment on anyone's life (commenting feels ratehr intrusive to me), nor the wits to post anything sparkly, helpful or good. Why would my 2 cents be useful in any way?  How could I dare to give a comment about a situation and assume I knew more than the person actually being in the situation?  It just doesn't seem to be my time for brilliant noteleaving However, you, my faves, can rest assured that I am there, silently lurking in the shadow, at least for a wee little while.   (and posting this feels terribly pretentious and so not like something this blog is intended to hold)

      It's the start of lent tomorrow, and here I find myself pondering whether I should give something up for lent, like I did two years ago.   Is it too ridiculous to give up all kinds of choc (including Nutella) and pepsi (two of my three main food groups at the moment; the third one is Frosties with Skim milk)? Would certainly help getting my eating back on track, if I don't end up just eating Frosties that is.  Shouldn't worry about it being big enough a sacrifice, as this isn't religiously motivated at all. Ever since that mass I took part in the week following September 11th, during which the bishop of Freiburg repeatedly called the attacks an "act of the devil", my turning away from organised belief feels like the RightThing. In a way, I envy those who believe, all the while being a wee bit amazed by the fact they do believe. It's so far removed from my being at the moment, yet it looks like life is easier if you have a set of rules to follow or the feeling that someone is watching over you or wanting good things to happen to you. I have neither. In any way, this isn't a religious exercise at all. More of a cleansing one. Or one of testing my ability to abstain.  Abstaining from my two favourite evils and adding some quiet time and  Sun Salutations every morning for at least the next 40 days would probably make me feel better both inside and out. Would also help in finally getting me on track re: the agreement I have with Evan about looking after myself better.  So that's a plan then: No choc, no caffeine, no carbonated drinks, centering myself and being good to myself. Sounds hard enough anyway.

       urlLink International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia: The Trial of Slobodan Milosevic   Have been watching it on  urlLink CNN , amazed at seeing history in the making, really. I am impressed and proud that the United Nations, that we as "humanity", are bringing a dictator to court and treating him fairly. In past times, he would have been killed when caught, now he gets a trial, so the world can see why what he did was wrong. It's a lesson to every dictator-to-be sitting somewhere plotting his very own plans of genocide. Humanity doesn't stand by and watch and tolerate. How could we, after  urlLink Srebrenica?  (for more, read the excellent book  urlLink Endgame: The Betrayal and Fall of Srebrenica, Europe's Worst Massacre Since World War II  by David Rohde.)  Maybe one fine day, we will indeed have an International Criminal Court. I wish that we do, even though I doubt we will as long as the US keep playing global police and let their soldiers commit war crimes that need to swept under the table and be dealt with internally instead of in front of a global tribunal.

        Just this morning I experienced another bout of physical "being apart" pain, as usual in the shower, where -for obvious reasons- I feel really defenseless. Stood there, and felt alone, and imagined him there, just like a week ago. Have been pondering whether I should do a countdown online, the reverse to what I didd before he came here, but have come to the conclusion that it would be just too depressing to watch the time since we've last been together tick by, without knowing just exactly when we *will* be together again.  Could do with some cuddling right now. Or better yet: a plane ticket.

       I've developed a real excitement about  urlLink Home Comforts: The Art and Science of Keeping House  by Cheryl Mendelson, a book I got for christmas (from my wishlist, I might add). It's what I always wanted and needed. - A comment that surprised many males I knew and a comment that many gals I know wholeheartedly agreed to once they saw the book. And no, we're all liberated and feminist, at least to a certain degree.  "The Art and Science of keeping house" is not a "100 hints how to make house keeping faster" book. It's old-fashioned in it's authorative tone and  exhaustively detailed about issues ranging from "how to lay a table" to "carefully disregarding care labels in clothing" to "why antibacterial cleaners are unncessary". It's not about Martha Stewart-like house decorations or about style: it's about basic housekeeping chores that you never really think about until you either wonder how to do them or get into a discussion about habits with someone who does something differently to you. It's been consulted by me and various friends on such important questions as "how often should you change your sheets?", "how do you remove wax stains from fabric?" and "when should you get rid of your chopping board?". Indeed, the Food Safety section of the book is extensive and really helpful. Some reviews at amazon called this author, Cheryl Mendelson, a lawyer and housekeeper, a "cleaning nazi", but really, I do not feel threatened by the book or the routines described in there all or feel like I am told exactly how and when to do something. Instead it offers endless variations and stresses that *you* need to decide which routines fit your lifestyle.  In any way, now you know it: I enjoy house keeping.  Until a few years back, I was always a big hoarder & collector. Aside from books, I never collected anything specific, instead I just kept all random "things" that crossed my way. I never threw away magazines, ticket stubs, the contents of kinder surprise eggs, little paper bits written in class and the like. You get the idea. My two tiny attic rooms at my parents place were filled with these kinds of "things": Nothing of real value. Nothing that served a real purpose. Once I had read them, I hardly looked at the hundreds of magazines. I forgot just why exactly I had kept that empty champagne bottle for months. Sometimes, between stacks of useless stuff, I'd come across something I "really" wanted to keep but that had gotten lost in the masses of things I didn't *really* need. I can't pin the exact moment down when I started throwing away stuff, but one morning I woke up and realised that - as corny as it sounds- less baggage makes for a nicer treck on the road of life. - And that memories rarely depend on "things". So I started "le grande throw out", which has turned into an almost  yearly ritual: I submerge myself deeply in the content of all my cupboards and drawers, sort each and every thing I own and throw or give lots and lots. A very liberating experience.  Once I had discovered how nice it is to have a de-cluttered life and livingspace, I discovered the pleasure of cleaning. It must have been building up inside my litle obsessive compulsive personality for a while: the demon was unleashed once I moved from flatmate hell to my first tiny appartment. Here, it didn't take long until my rather extreme sense of order appeared. Still have the excuse that  "the lack of space makes it necessary" . In any way, I started to really enjoying house keeping. I like orderly bookshelves. I get an immense pleasure out of scrubbing the shower or the bathroom sink, I like clean shiny windows and doing a wee bit of gardening on my balcony. It's all instant gratification: You do something and see the result immediately, and they last for a little while, too, and make you happy for that little while. ( urlLink Hanne  wrote something about  urlLink just that yesterday ) For me, cleaning this flat or sorting and re-arranging things is a good way to get rid of anger, to activate me when I feel like really not doing a single thing, to clear my head. I'd call it meditative, actually.  There are only two possible reasons for me for not looking after this flat: I am either busy  spending time in bed  catching up with my toyboy and couldn't care less about doing the dishes. Or I am on the downslide into the familar caves of depression. It happens. As long as I house keep, you don't need to worry about me.  While we're at it, I make another confession: Yup. I sometimes overdo it, the order thing. I need to learn to be less german, and more aussie and to relax more sometimes. And I am getting there. Having a "home" is less about cleanliness and order than about a certain feeling your living quaters give you. It's about cooking meals and eating them in a nice way with people around you. It's ultimatively about enjoying your space. Thanks Mrs.Mendelson for teaching me that.  As I really do not feel like cooking now, and have no one to share meals with: excuse me while I am off to clean my bathroom.

      Bought to you via  urlLink Jason  and  urlLink Cory   urlLink  White Supremacist Dating Tips  .  "Women get turned on by seeing men work, play, and just move around. Your reflexes are so fast! You are so much stronger than we are. It's nothing short of mesmerizing. When you only let her see you sitting in a chair and walking down a street, you hide almost your entire self, as a man, from her. Let her see you carry the heavy pack. Lift her down off the rock. If there's a party, don't just sit there! Organize a game that excites the girls: chase them around with a pair of vampire teeth. (Women are fascinated with Dracula.) Play murder-murder, a great cocktail party game where you get your sweetie off into the basement, a closet or an upstairs bathroom -- and "strangle" her, leaving the other party guests to discover the "body" and solve the mystery of who the "killer" was. Pillow fight. Grab her and point a silly toy phaser to her head and say, "Now you have to do whatever I want. You're my prisoner." Say, "I'm going to teach you how to dance. Come here." If there's a silly plastic Halloween knife (which you brought) on the coffee table then why not pick it up and say, "Hmm. This is a nice knife. (pause) Rrrrrrr! All the better to rape you with, Liz!" And hear her laugh and squeal."   Yup, I, too, believe that this advice is one step on the way to making sure these guys do not find mates and manage to procreate.   footnote: interestingly enough, the  female  authour of this advice is  urlLink still single . are we seeing a wee bit of generalisation here? You know, girly, not all women enjoy being scared with knives and threatened to be raped. And those who do, prefer having a  urlLink safeword , love.

      Stayed up late last night, writing soppy eMails the toyboy won't read before Monday, watching the german pre-coverage to the  urlLink Olympics with one eye , falling asleep just as R Kelly started to sing. Out of protest, I guess. Oh, the glory of it all. Unfortunately I didn't turn off the TV, or got around doing it the next 20 times I sort of woke up in the next few hours. Felt like Evan was in the room, and my tired little brain kept thinking that it was because of him that the TV was on ( Why would he want to see the Winter Olympics though? ), and I kept asking him to turn off the TV and come to bed. Even threw all the extra pillows I re-added this past week and my hot water bottle and Francesca out of the bed to make the bed more appealing to him, but still, he wouldn't come to bed.  When will my subconcious realise he's not there at night anymore?  Really, how bad can it get this weekend? I am in desperate need of distraction, and all I will be able to see on TV is either german carnival from each and every fucking region of this country (on prime time, mind you, and not of prime quality at all), or .. urlLink what's on this weekend? ...fresstyle, cross country skiing and ice hockey. Great.

       urlLink Teleporting larger objects becomes real possibility  This, unfortunately, doesn't mean that there'll be beaming any time soon (a technique from which the toyboy and I would greatly profit).

      Felt like joining into the  urlLink  Friday Five   Thing from Heather @   urlLink smattering.org . Voilá: First Time Friday Fives. If I believed in Virginity, I'd call them "virginal". He.   1. What's the most romantic thing you've ever done for someone else?  Thinking about it, I had to realise I am not one for grandiose romantic gestures, going on tv aside (but then I didn't start that one off), am more for the little things. Such as roses at airports, tram trips to work with my toyboy in the morning, just to spend these 15 minutes with him, and the like.   2. [pardon the cosmo question] What are your erogenous zones?  My brain. Honestly. Talk seductively into my ear. Hell, if you do it right, reading the phone book will do. Then do something, anything to my neck, and I am yours.   3. How old were you the first time you had sex? Care to expound?  Had sex with myself starting when I was young, partnered sex younger than most, and vaginal intercourse (that's "sex" for most people, isn't it?) at the pretty standard age of 16 (going on 17), with someone that I loved a lot, who was an artist and 9 years older than me. Our afterglow talk was about Mark Rothko. And it was all pretty decent for first intercourse, I reckon.   4. What's the most unusual place you've ever had sex?   urlLink There.    5. Do you have plans for Valentine's Day or is it just another Thursday?  No big romantic plans for me, considering the toyboy is far away (as usual). If he were here, we'd have a nice couply evening, I am sure. *sigh*

      I feel like Monday today, btw. Not like Friday at all. All because I've been stripped of the rituals that held me together these past weeks. No coupledom, cuddling, penne alla panna for me tonight. Really don't feel like eating at the moment. Had a pretzel at ProFa earlier today, threw down some chocolates and cashews a while ago. And feel sick now. Oh, how surprising. Should really get to the supermarket soon, buy some decent food. And eat it, too, in normal quantities.  Thinking about my toyboy, far away in  urlLink northeast Thailand , who's off to Laos tomorrow, and can't get the pictures from last weekend, the sun-filled, love-filled, sex-filled perfect weekend out of my stupid little head. Why the hell is it Friday? Were it Monday, I would at least feel the pressure togetsomethingdone. Not now though.  Feels like it's time for redesign and/or relocation. Nothing like a bit of html to take your mind off things.

      The daughter of the student who died while giving birth in her dorm's bathroom ( urlLink as mentioned previously ) passed away last week, too, 4 days after her mother. Karen Hubbard's case sparked Melbourne's  urlLink "The Age"  to publish  urlLink "Counting the costs of sex and shame" , a pretty decent, if slightly superficial article about teen sexuality and shame in the US. Worth checking out. Quite obviously, it's always easy to critisize from afar. But still, the authour has more than just one point there.

      Wanted to go to bed hours ago.  Not that I really "wanted to", but felt like I should. And now I am still sitting here in front of my computer, randomly eating things without any nutritional value, avoiding to take off my clothes and go into the shower and be overwhelmed with flashbacks of being in there with him, earlier this week, him washing my hair while I lean against him.  And the bed... I just don't want to wake up in the middle of the night and search for him. I just want to sleep, and tomorrow to start. I want the day to be over, and peace of mind.

      He's gone. And it's as bad as I feared it would be. Or worse. Or whatever.  Spend the last 2 days at my parents place, wrapped up in cotton wool, and now that I am back here in my flat, the emptiness of it all, of the flat, of me, hits me for the first time. It might sound trivial, but it's realising there's just one bath towel on the rack, no razor by the sink and an half empty closet that brought tears to my eyes. Same goes for putting away my backpack, not seeing his things in my cellar, discovering that he put the bag that we used on Monday to bring our stuff to the laundromat exactly where it should go. Smiling at the fact he really made an effort of doing it the same ocded way I like things to be.  It's the away-ness that hurts me. I know he's not feeling to well, and here I am, a few thousand km away, not feeling too well either. And all I want is to be next to him. Yes, all is good. But why in all the world, if we are that sure of us, and it all, than why can't we just be together *now*?  Am  tired, but I really don't want to sleep tonight, for I slept in this bed with him for more nights than without him. It will feel so empty.  How can  get back to normal? I have no clue.

      Already Friday.  Where did this week go?  We both had a sucky night last night...Evan had another bout of migraine, so we went to bed really early. - Too early for me: I woke up at 2am, wide awake, tried to sleep, tried not wake Evan up, got sad feeling him next to me, cried a bit, lay awake for ages, until Ev told me to turn on the light and simply try to read a bit. And indeed, that worked splendidly, 15 pages of The Return of the King, and I managed to fall asleep soon after, indeed finding some rest and waking up feeling pretty ok. Spend the morning running errands and doing grocery shopping to last us the entire weekend, trying to save a few cents by making the tram trip out to the large out of town  urlLink supermarket . Really, as much as I love the , the new coins and notes, the going over the border without changing money thing, the unity aspect of it, the price rise this past month has been horrendous. I have no idea where all my money went this month, it just dissolved somehow.  Also prepared the last bits for Evan's little goodbye pressie. Only need to write his card, our usual goodbye ritual (just remembered how I wrote the first card for him, sitting in the large room in the YMCA hostel in Berlin, almost to the day 2 years ago, unbelievable how many things have changed since then), should do this soonish, he'll (hopefully) be home soon. Also prepared Tiramisu for tomorrow.... this should be a nice weekend, filled with culinary and other delights. To cover the sadness, at least a wee little bit.  I promise, my Tiramisu can do that.      The World's best Tiramisu    -High-Cal, salmonella-risky but bloody awesome-    To be prepared the day before you want to consume it.    You'll need    4 eggyolks  of really really fresh eggs, otherwise everyone will come down with salmonella  80g sugar  the inside of  1/2 of a vanilla bean , the really fresh stuff. Otherwise, the best extract you can find, in that case, enough for 500ml  500g mascarpone   200 ml espresso , freshly brewed and cooled  4 cl grappa  or brandy  150g  (or more)  spoon biscuits , the sugar covered kind, the cheapest usually do  cocao  with very low fat content  confused by the measurements?  urlLink go here to convert     Mix the eggyolks with the sugar until the sugar is completely dissolved and the mixture has a nice creamy texture. This can take several minutes. Add the scratched out insides of the vanilla bean or the vanilla extract.  Put away the mixer. You'll now need a wooden spoon or a whisk, as you want to be gentle with the mascarpone. - If you beat it, the mixture will get runny and will not be edible!  So, using the spoon, lowly add -a spoon full at a time- the mascarpone to the egg/sugar/vanilla mix. Stir gently, until almost all clumps are gone. Add another spoon full, stir until the clumps are gone, and so forth, until you've slowly added all the mascarpone. You should now have a nice thick creamy mixture. Put it aside for a sec.  Combine the cold espresso with the grappa.  Now you're almost done. - You just need to layer the Tiramisu. Put half the biscuits into a low ceramic souffle tin, soak them with half of the espresso/grappa mix, be generous here. Pour half of the mascarpone mixture on top of the biscuits, spreading it evenly. Put the other half of the biscuits on top, soak them with the rest of the espresso/grappa mix, put the rest of the mascarpone mix on top. Voila, that's all your work for the day. Cover the tin with cling wrap and put it in the back of the fridge. Wait for as long as you can bear, at least overnight. The longer you wait, the mushier the biscuits, the yummier the entire thing. Before serving, sprinkle it thickly (through a sieve) with cocoa.  Enjoy.  If there are any leftovers after your first serving (which is rather unlikely), put the leftovers, covered with cling wrap, quickly back into the fridge. Make sure you consume them as soon as possible, if you've kept the Tiramisu in your fridge longer than 3 days, consider throwing it out for the salmonella risk.    Anyway, more maybe later. Or maybe next week. Or whenever I get back online. I got a boy to kiss and make love to and with and a life to live this weekend.  Come next week, all will be back to normal.  And no. I really am not looking forward to that.

       urlLink Friday Five . And on a Friday, too!   1. What's your favorite animal?  It's a whole group of animals: marsupials. Yes. Ridiculous. Caused by my general liking of Australia. But I do love them all, especially Koalas.   2. What pets have you had in your lifetime?  2 Goldfish, 2 budgies (which i'd never have again, btw) and three cats (Milka, named after the choc brand because she looked liek a cow and who was run over by a car; Isis, who died a tragic vet induced death and Mephiste, who hates me with a passion). Or four cats, if you count Kisek, the outdoor cat who *really* belongs to the evil neighbours as mine.If I consider how much food he's gotten at my place and that he waits in front of my door every morn and nigth, I think he qualifies.   3. Is there any specific pet that you've wanted but never had? Why?  Nope, not really. I'm not one for exotic pets and never dreamt of having snakes or spiders.   4. Are you allergic to any animals?  Nope.   5. Do you have any 'pet' pet peeves (your pets or others')?  Mephiste going berserk when my parents are away and urinating all over the place, just for entertainment. Cat food smell - Mephiste loves the one kind that stinks the most. Cat food containers that you can't open without getting any on your hands.

      Am feeling braindead and tired and lonely and ugly and fat and just not good at all. Felt so low that I didn't even call Ev this morning, which had been my plan. Don't know when and how this developed, but I am without any drive at all and all I manage is flipping TV channels and pouring Corn Pops into a bowl. Yes, very very useful state of being. Have to get over it, and soon, too, or otherwise I will stay here in rentstown longer than I should. I need to get away. But somehow I fear that life in hometown won't be much better.  What caused this? I have no idea. Skipping my estrogen for two days (which I did to see whether it had any effect on menstruation, which it did) is prolly not to blame. It's life here. And being alone. And just everything. And I hate it.

      Its difficult to express what it feels like to be away from Ev at the moment. The little bit of writing ability that I have fails me here. I try to write something down, and it sounds pretentious, pseudo-romantic and not at all like what it feels like. As strange as it is, posting that song by Alanis Morisette (of all people), comes pretty damn close to what it feels like. Its without boundaries and expectations, deep and unconditional and caring. And good grace, I never expected it to ever be this way.  On an unrelated note: Am keeping my fingers crossed for  urlLink Grim  and sending good energy over the channel for him: He has a scary embassy interview deciding about his immigration to the US tomorrow and is hence doing something quite similar to what I will probably find myself doing one not too distant day away; from what I hear, Aussie Immigration is not far behind the Americans in level of evilness, scariness and strictness. Its been so damn good to read about all the goodness, nervousness, the being scared, the preparations and whatever else leading up to his -if all goes well- upcoming move and marriage to  urlLink Kate . The best of luck to you, Graeme. Itll all work out splendidly. And if they indeed ask for a  urlLink chicken recipe : theres a damn good Chicken Curry Recipe for 4-6 people in Happy Days with the Naked Chef. :)

       You Owe Me Nothing In Return   ~Alanis Morissette~   I'll give you countless amounts of out-right  acceptance if you want it. I will give you  encouragment to choose the path that you  want if you need it.  You can speak of anger and doubts, your fears and freak-outs and I'll hold it. You can share your so-called "shamefilled" accounts  of times in your life and I won't judge it.  And there are no strings attached to it.  You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give.  You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have. I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege, and you owe me nothing in return.  You can ask for space for yourself  and only yourself and I'll grant it. You can ask for freedom as well or time to travel and you'll have it.  You can ask to live by yourself or love someone else and I'll support it. You can ask for anything you want,  anything at all and I'll understand it.  And there are no strings attached to it.  You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give.  You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have. I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege, and you owe me nothing in return.  I bet you're wondering when the next payback shoe will eventually drop. I bet you're wondering when my  conditional police will force you to cough up. I bet you're wondering how far you  have now danced your way back into debt. This is the only kind of love  as I understand it that there really is.  You can express your deepest of thruths even if it means I'll lose you and I'll hear it. You can fall into the abyss on your way to your bliss, I'll empathize with. You can say that you'll have to skip town to chase your passion and I'll hear it.  You can leave and hit rock bottom have a mid-life chrisis and I'll hold it.  And there are no strings attached to it.  You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give.  You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have. I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege, and you owe me nothing in return.  You owe me nothing for giving the love that I give.  You owe me nothing for caring the way that I have. I give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege, and you owe me nothing in return.    mantra: i don't feel guilty for quoting alanis morisette. I still don't like her music after all. i don't feel embarrassed for quoting alanis morisette. I still don't like her music after all. i don't feel guilty for quoting alanis morisette. I still don't like her music after all. i don't feel embarrassed for quoting alanis morisette. I still don't like her music after all.

       urlLink Friday Five  on a Saturday. As usual. :)   1. What makes you homesick?  I am rarely homesick for the place I am at the moment, parentstown. Never really. A tiny bit maybe when thinking about the outdoor cat. I get homesick for unitown when thinking about the comfort of my flat, my computer and what it sounds and looks like to walk along the main street on a sunny summer saturday morning. I get homesick for Melbourne (hometown-to-be) all the bloody time: when listening to Something for Kate, when Formula One is on TV, when I am thinking about the toyboy, when I see anything Aussie anywhere. All the bloody time.   2. Where is "home" for you? Is it where you are living now, or somewhere else (ie: Mom & Dad's house, particular state/city)?  I consider unitown, the city where Ive lived for the past 4 ½ years home.   3. What makes it home for you? People? Things?  Home is where the heart is. I can feel at home without my things if I am surrounded by those who I love. I can feel at home at a new place, where there is no one that I know (yet) if I have my things. So its all, really. I can feel at home at new places quite quickly.   4. Where is the furthest you've been from home,  urlLink  miles-wise ?  11580 miles (18637 km). Thats the distance between Christchurch, New Zealand, where I lioved for a while in 1996 and parentstown, which was my then hometown. Ive probably been further away, considering that I travelled a lot in NZ and went further south then CHCH. But you get the drift. Ive been as far away as I possibly can, I reckon. And I really didnt mind at all.   5. What are your plans for this weekend?  Work on Saturday. Rent a movie featuring Viggo Mortensen. Read some books. Cook some good food. Bake a bread from a recipe in Happy Days with the Naked Chef. Clean up after the neurotic cat. Talk with the Toyboy. Visit Grandmother. Convince brother to let me drive the Boxster. Thats about it. All terribly un-exciting.

      Oh, life. Its busy and boring and unexciting. Spend the morning in the bookshop, unpacking orders, re-organizing shelves, running errands. And keeping an eye on the cash register, too, as StealingEmployee worked today. And she need money on Saturdays.  Need food. And a good nights sleep. And a kiss and a cuddle from the toyboy, too. At least I can provide myself with the first. My sleeping really sucks at the moment. Dont know whether its simply the small bed and the screaming cat, or what else. I hate waking up early in the morning - I keep fearing that its the starting sign of yet another bout of being in the fangs of depression at its finest. When I have been sleeping, the dreams my subconcious has been making up have been terrible, too. Dreamt about being in a choir with Kitto, following a cult, with Thorsten being a member, too, and him being psychotic and delusional. Dreamt about a friend of mine, Tim, being dead. All rather dark and not nice. - And a lot more surreal than my dreams usually are.  Anyway. Time to get my bum out of the shop, I reckon, time to get home, cook a nice meal and start watching a mindless little movie yet to be collected from the video store.  If Ev was here, or I was where he is, Id know a thousand better ways to spend this weekend.

      I miss Evan terribly, by the way.  Spending an hour on the phone with him today talking about travel plans and job plans and future plans made me realize again how much better my life is when we're not 16.409 km apart.

      It's dark out there, and raining heavily, and I had to flee the house because the household help is there and I can't stand the noise and rustle and bustle. Am grateful though for her being there and doing things I don't feel like doing: the neurotic cat has been peeing all over the place because my mother isn't there and really, all my wiping and febreezing the carpet after the cat has hardly been enough. Urgh.  Think I will now head off to Ikea to look at things, get the urge to re-decorate and move out and feel sad because of all the cuddly couples there (not as sad as previously though, Ev and I were a cuddly Ikea couple, too, while he was here, and that helped. lots.). Oh, and search for my sparkliness.  Yes, life is terribly exciting.

       ich weiss was ich will   ~udo jürgens~   dein haar weht im wind,  von meinem fenster aus  da seh' ich dich geh'n,  du winkst herauf und bleibst sekundenlang steh'n.  ich denk', wie schön war es doch eben noch hier mit dir.   ich weiß was ich will.  ich will dich fühlen, wenn der morgen erwacht,  mit dir den tag verbringen, bis in die nacht,  und glauben, nirgends ist ein ende in sicht,  nein für uns nicht.   ich weiß was ich will.  Ich will die leidenschaft, mit der du mich liebst,  die sanfte zärtlichkeit, wie du sie mir gibst,  die illusion, du lebst allein nur für mich,  die brauche ich.   ich weiß was ich will.  ich will, daß endlich etwas neues beginnt,  daß wir wie ein gedanke, ein körper sind,  das ist mein ziel.  sag' mir nur eins: will ich zuviel?   ich weiß was ich will.  dir alles zeigen, was ich jemals geseh'n,  was du auch immer tust, verzeih'n und versteh'n,  was ich noch nie vorher im leben getan,  fang' ich jetzt an.   ich weiß was ich will.  ich will dich nie mehr aus den augen verlier'n,  will deine hände sanft und weich auf mir spür'n,  glauben daran, daß es auch so weitergeh'n kann.   noch kann ich dich seh'n.  mit schnellem schritt gehst du die straße entlang,  mit deinem so vertrauten typischen gang,  ich denk,' wie schön war es doch eben noch hier mit dir.   ich weiß was ich will.  an einem leeren strand allein mit dir sein,  und alles tun, was man so tun kann zu zwein,  und kein gedanke von uns bleibt ungesagt,  nichts wird vertagt.   ich weiß was ich will.  wie ein zigeuner durch die welt mit dir zieh'n,  dem ganzen zirkus dieses daseins entflieh'n,  und alles das bis uns die sinne vergeh'n,  wär das nicht schön?   ich weiß was ich will,  daß jede nacht für uns zum karneval wird,  und jeder weg nur zueinander uns führt,  das ist mein ziel.  sag' mir eins: will ich zuviel?   ich weiß was ich will.  ich will dich ganz und gar und immer um mich,  was uns im wege steht das ändere ich,  ich hab' noch nie im leben berge versetzt,  ich tu' es jetzt.

      Still over-eating and trying to divert energy into cleaning up and ironing. Not working too well. Still feeling bored and rather alone, too. I so hate being here. Even the order that arrived yesterday (jacket, nighty, bras -without bows!-, pjs for Ev) hasnt lightened my mood. Ive come to realize that shopping really doesnt help at all. I was so bored that last night, that I rented  urlLink Bridget Joness Diary  -of all movies- which was even worse than I what I expected it to be like. I am whiny, too, but at least I dont behave like a 15 year old. Good grace, what a horrible depiction of women that thing was. gah.   Stuff at the shop is relatively ok. Even though all this shit about telling off employees about disappering money feels like I am cleaning up someone elses (namely my mothers) business. Which I am, really. But am only allowed to do half a job. And I hate it. Every second of it. Let me throw out StealingEmployee, and all will be well.  Have to deal with this shit just because shes lacking leadership abilities. Thanks mother. Now lets see whether all the money thats supposed to be there is there today. It should be. StealingEmployee wasnt there today.  "Anything but sanity - fortified with an extra dose of whining". I hereby promise to get my zest back sometime these next few days. Not that I know how. But Ill try.

       Apple Cinnamon Muffins  ~for a dozen small muffins or half a dozen giant ones that taste as good as the muffins you get at Hudosn Coffee in Melbourne~   Youll need    1/2 cup buttermilk 1 egg 1/4 cup butter 1 tsp. vanilla extract 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 really nice baking apple (such as a boskoop) peeled, cored and cubed nicely 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 1 tsp. cinnamon 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. baking soda 2 tsps. double-acting baking powder    Pre-heat oven to 350-F degrees/195°C and prepare muffin tins with a light spray of non-stick cooking oil. In a mixing bowl, mix butter, egg and sugar and vanilla extract. Add buttermilk, then the flour to which youve already added the baking powder, baking soda and salt. Blend. Finally add the spice and the apple cubes (which should be stirred in with a wooden spoon). Divide batter equally among muffin cups, approximately 2/3 full. Bake for 20-25 minutes until a toothpick can be cleanly removed from the center of a muffin. Sprinkle lightly with sugar before serving.  If youre alone and as eating disordered as me, you wont have much trouble finishing the dozen within 48 hours. If youre more civilised, store the cooled muffins (without sugar on top) in an air-tight container.

       33   ~viggo mortensen~   hace dias que te veo desde arriba. los demas fingen volar. me gustan los aviones, pero no me hacen falta. estudio mis manos en vez de tus ojos. ?cuando sabes como te llamas cuando nadie te escucha? la lluvia canta en la chapa los suenos de ayer, cada gota frenada por el techo de la cocina donde duermo con el gato en la falda.

      Re: New Zealand: when i fed the outdoor cat yesterday morn, the morning smelled like winter mornings in christchurch did in 1996. Clear, sunny, blue, fresh. I somehow expected to see the Southern Alps in the distance behind the houses, like you do when crossing the street in front of my NZ girls's school.  But all i saw yesterday were the chimneys from the coal mine.

       urlLink Friday Five  on a Sunday. Better late than never.   1. What's your favorite vacation spot?  The NZ West Coast (not in winter though). Or somewhere in Victoria. Or a city...Melbourne, London, Amsterdam - anytime.   2. Where do you consider to be the biggest hell-hole on earth?  Greymouth, New Zealand. I throughoutly hated the place for the few hours that I was there. Actually, any place on the adorable NZ west coast that was larger than 10 houses kinda sucked.   3. What would be your dream vacation?  Ev and me on an Island somewhere in Queensland.   4. If you could go on a road-trip with anyone, who would it be and why?  Ev. Maybe not with his beloved car Heidi (she really isn't the most reliable gal to take on a road trip), but him, no doubt. All the little wannabe road trips we've had have been lovely.   5. What are your plans for this weekend?  Therapeutic cleaning and ironing, talking my brother into a Boxster ride, visiting grandma, watching viggo sex scenes. All terribly exciting.

      was a busy yet somehow uneventful week so far. the rents left for spain yesterday, and -surprise!- the first 100 (!) &euro were missing from the cash register yesterday. lovely. and yes, the employee who i suspect to have grabbed the 1400 &euro back in january worked yesterday, too. nice. nice. nice. I would so like to throw her out immediately.  that aside, i've been compensating for lack of human contact and whatever else with cooking and overeating, purchasing pricey cosmetics (thanks to  urlLink shiseido  and  urlLink mac  for assisting me with that) and trying to buy clothes (being partly successful for a change). oh, and watching the sex scenes in  urlLink a perfect murder  in slow mo (imagining, for once, to be gwyneth paltrow, even though i really don't like her very much: but her being in bed with viggo mortensen playing an artist makes her a lot better in my eyes) and ffwding through the sligthly scary scenes. yes, i am ridiculous.  must be that rugged tenderness or whatnot that mr.mortensen has in lotr. in this one, it's the frank appeal (not that frank had a criminal past, too, and would have taken money to kill someone), the creative, poor, long haired, intesen artist-thing.  other good thing: my brother was (still) terribly nice when i visited him at work on friday, and good grace, he's currently driving a  urlLink Porsche Boxster  (instead of the usual  urlLink tiny bmw ). nice. hope i can persuade him to a little drive round town to frighten the neighbours sometime these next few days. think he's just nice because he feels guilty for being the first to leave this country (if only to london)and thus makes things even harder for me with the family. it's strange: the general sentiment towards my brothers departure is one of  "oh, he doesn't have a choice really and how could he let go of that offer" , whereas i get no support at all because they don't take it seriously in the first place. bloody hell. i wonder when they'll do. prolly not even when i hop on the plane. or whenever.  anyway. time to detach myself from the puter. visit grandma later on, do some therapeutic cleansing and if boredom strikes me, check out those viggo sex scenes again to avoid the endless  urlLink rtl  replays of the melbourne formula 1 race (with frequent aerial overviews), which make my longing to be in that town even more unbearable. if i were the sucky employee, i'd have taken the money, too. and hopped on the next train to frankfurt airport.  life is boring. and all i want is to get away from here.

      It's three years to the day that I moved into this little flat here. Three years... unbelievable how quickly they passed. Unbelievable how much things have changed since then.  Three years ago, I was still with D (if on a steady downward spiral with him; we never had good times here, just the big fights). I was still good friends with people I don't see anymore at all. We had these strange AllyMcBeal sessions on tuesdays, tina, michael, ulf and me. I was still part of the InGroup. I got out a lot more. It were good times back then. But I don't miss them much. Yes, I made the mistake of eliminating all this superficiality from my life while not replacing it with goodness, but I don't miss that superficiality; I am happy that its gone. I realised that this semester was the first when I didn't get an invitation to the start of the semester party at the place where we used to hang out. And I don't mind at all.  I really feel like moving forward now. I need and want progress.  It started slowly, last week, with writing a bunch of eMails to people I had lost touch with, with paying off debt that was dragging me down, with organising my flight for July, with contacting my law firm. Sitting in Uni last night, in that seminar I really need to get done this semester in order to prepare for graduation (and that I just couldn't face these past semesters), I realised that I can do it. I could follow, despite all the latest changes in contracts law. It was shocking to realize that all my anxieties were unbased. I just sat there, listened and studied and nothing terrible happened. It wasn't embarrassing. It was good. Its shocking how much that motivated me, the fact that I was readily admitted two weeks too late, that I understood it all, that it was even *easy*, that I managed to force myself to sit there. It finally feels, for the first time in ages, that I can get this fuckin degree done.  And good grace, is that a lovely feeling. :)

      happy birthday. this little thing turns one today, which means that i've been writting online for almost 2 1/2 years, more or less regularly.  no time to look back though, tis time to look forward instead. part of it is not feeling sorry for this recent break. it was just another of my regular bouts of real life escapism, this time enforced by a nosey computer savy intern at the bookshop who kept staring over my shoulder everytime he heard the noises of the modem. out of fear of discovery (i.e. forgetting to clear the history, cache whatever else), i just   stayed away and emailed a bit, and that felt good and right. i had nothing much to say, but i feel the words and thoughts returning.  time to blow out the candle on the cake now. :) more later.  (oh, and while we're on the topic of birthdays: happy belated one,  urlLink dan .)

      It happened as I was leafing through a book that I had ordered the day before, while I was sitting in my car, waiting at a tram crossing.  I saw your name.  I registered it. I didnt read it consciously, my eyes recognized the shape of your written first and last name, the familiar sequence of letters, as I was quickly leafing through the book. A name I had written on post cards and envelopes. A name I had searched for in phone books, a name which has been in every address book Ive owned for the past 8 years, sometimes even without a current address, a name which had once meant almost everything to me, which still echoes emotions and memories.  In a split second, while I was sitting in my car, my eyes recognized the shape of your name. Up there on a page. Up there on a page in the black book I had ordered after it being mentioned in passing in a review in the last Sundays  urlLink FAS .  In that split second I felt a strange kind of panic, and excitement and surprise and happiness for you, and the desire to tell youstraight away. To tell you that I found it, found you, found it and you without looking for it. I had been looking for, searching out and expecting this moment for ages, and now -just as I wasnt doing any of this- I found it, I found you. Or rather: you did.  You found me. You crept up from behind.  Instead of checking the index, I frantically leafed through the book again, wanting to check whether it was really your name, or whether my eyes had played a trick on me. However the tram had passed, the red light had gone off, people behind me were honking and I had to throw the book on the seat next to me and drive on. I was at a red light again just a few meters down the road, immediately checking the book again.  And indeed, there it was. Your name. In front of two short stories.  I put the book away and drove the short way home, feeling the urge to tell someone about my discovery immediately, to tell you, to make up a clever cryptic little card hinting at me discovering it, to do something, to read the stories. I wondered whether you'd think I was stalking you if I contacted you about this; I wondered whether your heart and mind and energy were in this book in the first place or whether this is just you again, playing against the rules of everyone and everything, purging things on paper or into a microphone, stuff you deem worthless, stuff others deem genious though, their praise being a source of great amusement for you. I remember meeting you on a train, on your way to performing at that strange hip little club in H, reading out the poetry you'd perform, things you had written that very morning. Something about a chap brushing his teeth until he had brushed to his bare bone. You're just too damn good at spontaneity.  At home, still sitting in my car, I read. Read the little biography in the back of the book, to be sure this was you, and not someone who just happens to have the same name. A few sparse details about you:  The author, artist and animator was born in 1975 in hometown, move to H. in 1996, this at Uni, that at Uni that at Art Academy. Now this. Part of these projects and collaborations.   I then read the two stories, which are obscure, strange, odd without much sense, and probably best when read and performed. They are just what I would have expected, really, had I expected that any of your writings would go public first: I had thought it would be your drawings, films and animations what youd get publicity for first, simply because from what I heard and read and found through google, that seemed to be what you were concentrating on lately. But you proved me wrong, like you so often did, most recently  (well, 18 months ago) with guilt and feeling sorry for things that happened (and, more acutely, didnt happen) between us years ago. ( Keep feeling guilty for sex we never had, chap. I really dont mind that at all. ) You've always been good at doing things, thinking things, saying things, which were the complete contrary to what everyone else, to what I expected.  Ive calmed down a bit now. It takes only little time to get used to a name on paper and this is not totally unexpected after all: Just that morning, I had been wondering about the project that had published the freshly ordered book, whether you were a part of it, had checked the groups website specifically for your name, to no avail. Im happy for you, really, I wonder about your opinion on it, I wonder whether it  will appear more strange if I mention it the next time I see you (whenever that may be) than if I do so now in whatever way. I still feel the urge to tell you, to show you that I found you without looking, to acknowledge your little success, even though I know that you most likely don't give a shit about me knowing about your work, because you probably deem it and the entire project worthless and pretentious. But then: because Id expect that from you, it might be just the other way around, and this *does* mean something to you. One never knows with you.  Ill probably be wise and grown up and not do anything. Ill keep on staying away.  Ill keep on silently observing and wondering, occasionally checking google (hoping no one who has a website with your name on it knows you and checks his referrer logs and tells you about that person searching for you in google), hoping all my knowing wont creep out of me the next time I see you, like it did last time. Ill keep on being happy for you, from afar.  And never tell you what its all been really like for me, all these years.       flinch  ~alanis morisette~  What's it been over a decade? It still smarts like it was four minutes ago We only influenced each other totally We only bruised each other even more so  What are you my blood? You touch me like you are my blood What are you my dad? You affect me like you are my dad  How long can a girl be shackled to you How long before my dignity is reclaimed How long can a girl stay haunted by you Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name  Where've you been? I heard you moved to my city My brother saw you somewhere downtown I'd be paralyzed if I ran into you My tongue would seize up if we were to meet again  What are you my god? You touch me like you are my god What are you my twin? You affect me like you are my twin  How long can a girl be tortured by you? How long before my dignity is reclaimed And how long can a girl be haunted by you Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name  So here I am one room away from where I know you're standing A well-intentioned man told me you just walked in This man knows not of how this information has affected me But he knows the colour of the car I just drove away in  What are you my kin? You touch me like you are my kin What are you my air? You affect me like you are my air

      Late Sunday, and I am sitting in the office of the bookshop, hoping it wont get too busy so that I can just stay here in the back, type a little and read a little and hope that time passes quickly. Working on a Sunday, without being directly paid. Nice. Oh, and have I mentioned that all this while I feel like shit?  I suspect mono, btw, (sore throat, enlarged lymphnodes, exhaustion, breathing problems, lack of appetite, swollen eyelids: the textbooks name it, I got it) teamed up with a sinusitis, even though my medical professional toyboy has changed his long distance diagnosis and thinks its just a random virus and not Epstein Barr. Oh well. Wont be heading home tomorrow, but will be paying my local GP a visit instead, to see what he thinks. If its mono, all I can do is rest anyway. Knowing for sure would only be psychologically helpful.  Oh well.  In any way, Id rather be home at the moment, and sleep. Which is what I did for a big chunk of yesterday. All terribly exciting.  I did go out on Friday night, btw, as I ran into Filiz just as I left the bookshop on Friday. Went to a strange Cafe instead of the old-time joint (because wed have been the oldest people there, scary) and talked for a good three hours or so. Was lovely, and like I expected, really. Its strange that the (strange) mechanics of our friendship are still working after loosing touch for almost 5 years. Shes still with the same guy that she was with back then, a relationship I deemed so insane when it started that I just could not deal with it. She started going out with Stefano because she was fucking and loving his partnered flatmate and best mate Thomas (and had been doing so for a good long while) and it just seemed like she was doing that just to have easy access to Thomas. It was all insane. Thomas and his then galpal got engaged, so Filiz and Stefano did, too. It just appeared to me as if her obsession with Thomas (she stalked him for a good year before she drove to his house one night and fucked him for the first time; she had a T tattooed on her hip, that sort of thing) was making her behave that way. And I just couldnt take it serious at all. In any way, it seems like I either got it all wrong back then, or that their relationship has changed now... They are happy, still engaged, planning to get married in five years or so. But then, Thomas moved away, too. He. In any way, Filiz is loving Med School, and just seems terribly happy and content and successful. Shes only significantly heavier than in the past, which is a very good thing as Filiz struggled with eating disorders throughout her teens (the relationship with Thomas was a pretty damn fine trigger), and those 10kg more on her hips look fabulous. They really do. Apart from getting back on track with each others lives, we gossiped a lot about the gals we (sort of) used to be in a clique with back in High School Hell: one is engaged to be married later this year, one is unhappy with it all, one is pregnant, one is freshly partnered, and one came out a few years ago, which I had totally missed. The latter made me very happy for my friend: I always expected that she was gay (dont ask me why, I just did. It wasnt her tomboyness, or the lack of boyfriends or the just one time she confessed to fancying a chap: somehow it was just impossible to imagine her with a male partner), or whatnot, and hearing about her coming out and living with her girlfriend makes me really happy for her. Must not have been easy, coming out to your conservative catholic family. Must not have been easy letting yourself come out to yourself when the plan everyone thinks you should live by includes having a hubbie and kids. Must not have been easy to struggle with your catholics belief system. But anyway: Martina: I am happy for your gal.  :)  It was a funky evening with Filiz, and we fell into our familiar roles, which made me realize how very different I am today. Back then, she was the more quiet, yet terribly determined (or rather fixated on Thomas) one, unsure of what she planned for her life though, as all she wanted was that undeserving gu. I was the loud one, screwing around, with plans for the rest of her life. Odd. She told me that our dear friend Simon, who I ended up making out heftily on the day we had our graduation alcohol-fest (and who stood in front of my door the next morn, wanting to go on a bike ride and a strawberries and champagne breakfast, which could have been the start of a nice summer fling, but which just wasnt) asked her a couple of weeks back how I was, whether she had heard from me, and whether she knew why we had made out that night 5 years ago. Cute to hear that I leave broken hearts behind. Cant wait for our 5 year reunion sometimes this year. He.  So it was a good night out, really, even though after we left, I got obsessed about what I said and started destroying the goodness of the night in my head in the usual way, through worrying about what I said when. Quite sickening.  Anyway. Good to know that shes there and that we can talk and that things can be okay between us. Its great relief: I had worried that it was all lost, and it just isnt. Nice. :)

      Re: My defence for being 15 minutes lates for a long awaited night out with a long-lost friend:  As my mother is out of town, I decided to use the massage session she had booked for tonight when the massage place called in at 6:30 to ask whether she was running late. 't was a normal 30 minute massage session, which would have left me with more than enough time to basically just hop next door to the cafe when I immediately ran off after the call. However, the previous client was running late. And  the masseur and I had a lovely chat, he took a good long while to help my hurting back. I got a 45 minute session. And once I was dressed and had paid and was next door at the cafe, I was 15 minutes late.  That's what you get for relaxing and taking out some time to heal.

      Things that are not good:  Being 15 minutes late for the first meeting in five years with the best friend you had during High School hell. Waiting for another 20 minutes at the meeting point to no avail. Not having her current mobile number. Calling her home, while still being unable to fully communicate with her non-german speaking mother on the phone.  Result: No going out tonight. No talks about the past. No gossping. Feeling pretty shitty.  Hoping to somehow get hold of her tonight. Duh.

      Life is okay.  The sun is shining, the parents are away for the weekend, I found the one  urlLink hair product  that makes my horse-like hair nice and smooth and soft and floppy and shiny,  I finished reading an exceptionally brilliant book ("Goldener Reiter" by  urlLink Michael Weins ), and best of all, in just about 2 hours, I'm meeting my best friend from High School, Filiz, who I ran into in the dairy products section of my local supermarket the other day. We lost touch when our paths took different directions after graduating five years ago, and well, I am almost as excited about catching up with her as if this was a date. :) There are some things only she understands, a fact I thought about every once in a while these past few years, and good grace, I can not wait to tell her about all the things I have wanted to tell her, these past 5 years. All the stories I think only she will get.  Life is good. Let's hope it stays this way for a while. Off to buy some new sunnies, a bag and some make up to help with that. Therapeutic shopping galore!

       urlLink Friday Five . :) On a  Friday! Hooray!   1. What are the first things that you do in the morning to start your day?  Move from bed to desk to check email while consuming an evil, unhealthy caffeine containing carbonated low cal drink. Drag myself into shower. Mediate in there. In summer, my days start with doing Sun Salutations on the balcony. Can't wait to get back into that habit.   2. What are the last things that you do at night before going to bed?  Brush teeth, talk on the phone, read for a few minutes.   3. What daily routine have you recently added to your day?  None really.   4. What routine do you wish you get rid of?  None really, too. I don't mind routines most days, including cleaning up and housekeeping. I *should* probably tell my mother to stop calling me as often as she does. The shrink thinks so, and I do, too. But well...   5. What's the one thing that makes you feel like something is missing if you don't do it some point within your day?  The dreaded mother call, prolly. And going online. Even though with the latter, I have weeks when I stay away from the net almost completely. Like at the moment.

      Am sick. For the second time in just about 10 days. Nice one. First a strep throat, that was killed with a dose of antibiotics that had me reaching for the Clotrimazol within 72 hours. Had so much natural, pro-biotic, living yoghurt, these past few days, that I feel like I am turning into a tub of actimel vanilla flavour myself. Now I have a sinusitis with that familiar running against a concrete wall feeling inside my head.  Bloody hell. Am terribly tired, and cant pick myself up at all. Was busy all last week working my ass off at a Childrens book fair (selling more books than ever before at that event, earning money for my flight); hated the holidays (despite a nice little trip to Holland on Good Friday), have been working my ass off in my parents garden this week. And now feel like nothing but lying somewhere in the dark. Hand me my NyQuil, please.  Its just been so much that blogging, checking eMail and being online was not a priority at all. Being offline made me miss the Labia-Blog-athon which is happening today. Big Bummer. But a big Hooray to everyone whos involved. You rock, people (check out various people living in my sidebar, like Sarah, Hanne, Heather who are all part of it). I just wouldn't be able to contribute anything body-positive today, as shitty as my body makes me feel. Have hardly managed to regularly talk with Ev, who I am missing terribly. Have been reading more about the Visa stuff, which hasnt been helping my mood either. How will I get all the money Ill need? All scary, even though I *feel* that well somehow get it all done. So strange that my personal happiness and future will depend on all that bureaucracy, and money. And whatever else. My brother will be starting is London job on the 15th and I am now seeing first hand what getting rid of all your belongings and sorting everything to go away is really like. And hes just moving next door, so to speak.  More soon. Promise. Kitto: *knuffels*, girl, and youll hear from me, soon.

         urlLink Friday Five . Late. But I liked these a lot. :)   1. If you could eat dinner with and "get to know" one famous person (living or dead), who would you choose?   Viggo Mortensen, even though that would mean Id drool the entire evening. Armistead Maupin, to discuss  The Nightlistener , which I just finished reading.   2. Has the death of a famous person ever had an effect on you? Who was it and how did you feel?   The first one that comes to mind (and that is  prolly influenced by whats currently happening in the Middle East)  urlLink the assassination of Yitzak Rabin  on November 4th 1995. It was a Saturday night, I was in my room at my rents house, working on some paper for my advanced German Literature Class in School while CNN was on. I thought there would be war straight away, because in the first minutes after he was shot, everyone thought it must have been a Palestinian.  Footnote  Thinking about it for a bit longer, it was actually Kurt Cobain's suicide that was the *first* celeb death I really noticed. I sat on a plane from London, had grabbed a yellow press paper and read somewhere over the channel, on page 6 or 7 of that paper, not one mention on the front page, that he had shot himself. I couldn't believe that.   3. If you could BE a famous person for 24 hours, who would you choose?  Britney or George W. Bush.   4. Do people ever tell you that you look like someone famous? Who?  Evan thinks that I look like some gal who used to be on Neighbours (I think her name was Amy). Others think I look like Toni Collette (thankfully in her skinny and good haircut days).   5. Have you ever met anyone famous?  Various people from Lindenstrasse, assorted other German Soaps and various Big Brother seasons at parties or on planes and trains. One of my fave actors, Andre Eisermann at a seminar, Kai Pflaume (famous German TV presenter and host of All you need is love) when Ev and I went on TV, several German MPs and Politicians (including Gerry Adams), most of the time during seminars, a plethora of Ambassadors from NZ and Oz, a whole bunch of authors.  My NZ host sis once met Bono; cant top that one.

      Last night I dreamt that I was working at my law firm. A super positive dream that made me wake up totally sure that I'd hear from them today. Alas: nothing in my mailbox from them.  I wonder whether hotmail has eaten it or whatnot, considering how bizarre that thing has recently been: sending eMail to people I know that I've never written, on days when I didn't even log into it or touch my outlook or the net. weird. A virus or someone with my password? I wonder.  Mindless waiting for eMail aside, I'm terribly busy studying, and when not doing that, moving my ass (and other assorted body parts) at the gym. All terribly non exciting.  Oh, and I'm counting the days until I leave this country. Which is exciting, actually. Less then 70 now. Yihaa.

      The worst thing this week however, is a piece of news my mom broke to me yesterday: one of my parents best and oldest friends is in hospital, freshly diagnosed with tumors in both liver and pancreas. Both cancer types have shitty life expectancy alone, combined, they mean that one should better say everything you want the person to know straight away. It really is as grave as this. Evan had patietns in the hospital with metastatic liver cancer who literally died within a week.  My mom was in shock last night, when she heard about it, simply because he had been in and out of hospital for a big chunck of last year: with various viral infections, a diagnosis of Morbus Wegner, and whatever else. They put him through all kinds of imaging methods, and it makes one wonder, whether they never quite looked at those images thouroughly enough. My parent's friend is a manager for a very big german steal company and earns literally a million  a year. He had planned on giving up work next march. And now he's running out of time.  Makes one think that one should really do that "carpe diem" thing, and think about the things that really matter.

      No news as of now from "my" law firm. The excitement/pressure/what not is terrible. I can't go online from home at the moment, and the first thing I do when I pass any computer that's connected to the net is check my official eMail address. Only to find no mail from them (or anyone else on that addie). Argh. Not nice. Not nice. Not nice.  Feels like it's going to be a  "sorry, but..."  type of eMail from them: It shouldn't take too long to send a  "caro, we're thrilled to give you a chance to work with us again"  eMail. If it is indeed going to be a "no", I'd  feel terribly let down, considering they gave me that rave reference in 2000, that ended with something like  "we'd be glad to give her a chance to work if she comes back to australia" . Duh.  I send a prayer to the eMail gods, that I hear from them, soon. But then it's the weekend now. And long past working time in Australia. More waiting till Monday.  Have I mentioned that I hate waiting?

       urlLink Jan Ullrich  announced yesterday that he won't take part in this years  urlLink Tour de France  due to health issues. I'd been expecting this announcement ever since he was caught after a drunk-driving binge with his Porsche through my hometown (including a crash into some -hold your breath- parked bikes) last week, after a hefty stint at Freiburg's  "we're pretending that this is a metropolitan city"  hip joint, "kegan". Late night binge drinking just doesn't quite fit into a wannabe TdF winners preparation plan.  While I never liked him much as a rider, that means that the race is up for who will try to battle  urlLink Lance . I had so looked forward to seeing them duell on Mount Ventoux. I bet the tour will be a lot less exciting than last year. Duh.  Bummer.

      today was a day of miscommunication between evan and me. had someone taped our phone conversation, it could have been the study tape for  "long distance relationships 101" - lesson #5 - "how to not have phone calls with your lover" .  the reasons why we miscommunicated were plentiful.  i picked up the phone wanting a love-filled smooth little call, just like i had imagined it last night after the sucky evening that had been filled with missing ev. what i did not consider was that it wouldn't work out too well, simply because we'd be pressed for time as i still needed to get showered and dressed and to the voting booth before meeting tina in less than an an hour and a half from the time of dialing. bad bad bad pre-conditions.  i reached the toyboy in the middle of doing music stuff for next week's 21st of his brother and sister. caught him right in the middle of being in a shitty mood because he'd just been argueing with his sis about just that. you know, music and dj-ing is something he can be terribly serious about, you can't ask him to be responsible for the music of a party and then ask him to just play 80's kylie. that's just not a good idea in regards to dj ej. yep, catch him being dj ej, and you face a pretentious diva. plus it was the night before starting his last 6 weeks doing surgery together with his -him aside- all female group, before the first round of finals. big time  "there is nothing i can look forward to and your arrival is so far away, too" . bad bad bad pre-conditions on the other side of the globe, too.  we already started out on a bad note. i asked whether i called at the wrong time because some madonna song was quite loud in the background, and even that already didn't sound right. that's something you *feel*. you feel that the kind of conversation you're having or are starting to have is not good. you feel that you're hitting the wrong note, but can't really change something about it.  way too soon, i found myself giving him my opinion about the party music issue  (i.e. telling him he shouldn't be a pretentious dj diva, but make sure that his sis was having the type of party she wanted), to which he started to sulke because he obviously had heard the exact same thing before and because i wasn't  "on his side" . oh yeah. -pardon me- relationship or not, i am still allowed to give my honest opinion, am i not?  it ended with both of us getting angry about something that had any relevance to *us*. while it was happening, i saw the mechanics of how these phone calls evolve right before me, yet couldn't change them. i just sat there, silent, and got sad because all i had been looking for, all i had needed was a nice little loving phone call with some purring and being good to each other. and what we had both gotten ourselves into was just the opposite.  we could have both done with some re-assurance about this strange relationship we're having, could have done with some nice chatter about nothing in particular, but instead, we were being angry about nothing and started extending our argument to other battle-fields even as we were making-up (like  "are you sure we're okay again or do you just say that so that you can write me an angry eMail in three days time?") .  we did make up of course. it wasn't a biggie, it wasn't about anything that will be of importance in two weeks time. but it still hurt. it hurt that we couldn't just stop it. it hurt because had we been in the same room, the conversation wouldn't have started off that shitty and even if it had, it would have never evolved as far as it did. it hurt that my wee little expectations were yet again totally over the top and that i apparently still haven't learned to not expect specifics. it hurt that he brought up stuff that had no relevance to the useless little argument we had. it hurt to argue. the whole thing put a damper on my day.  all i had wanted him to know was that i missed him terribly all weekend, missed him when i got up, when i was having dinner with people i ddn't care about, when i walked home through the rain, when i went to bed alone. i wanted him to know that i couldn't wait for these stupid 79 (or whatever) days to pass. i wanted him to know that i love him.  feels like that message got lost in the wires.    and somebody was talking about romance and i thought, i thought what if my luck ran out?  beautiful sharks  ~something for kate~

      it's three pm on a saturday, and i'm drunk. not just tipsy, but not totally out of my head drunk.  but quite drunk, considering the time of the day.  tina came over at 9am for a trip to the laundromat and brekkie, and -as usual- did our saturday shopping spree together, too, inculding a trip to the condom shop for utensils for an insane friend of tinas. as we went to pick up her laundry, we walked right into a laundromat party: they opened their internet cafe today ( "surf while you wash" ) and not only offered free online time, but lots of champagne, too. rather quickly, tina and i were right in the middle of it,  flirting  chatting with some roommates of one of the owners. and good grace, was it delightful. always nice to meet some new people who aren't doing law or meds.  now i'm home again, it's just past three pm and i'm dizzy and think i should sleep for a while. in just about three hours, i should be at hendrik's dinner party, preferably non drunk and sparkly so that i can hold up to all the pharmacy students. yihaa.  life is good this saturday afternoon. now wish me sweet dreams. i need sleep.

      on sunday, the people of my city (me included) will get to decide who should be their new mayor. for the past 14 years, my city was governed by a socialdemocrat who decided to not complete his current term due to his age.  the first poll 2 weeks ago had the candidates of the green party and the christian democrats (conservative) getting the best results, so on sunday, all other freiburgers and me get to choose between gudrun heute-blum of the conservatives, and dieter salomon, of the green  party.  i have been looking into their positions for a bit of the afternoon to build an opinion, as i didn't vote in the first round; not because i didn't want to, but because i was away, and had forgotten to order stuff for postal vote.      urlLink gudrun heute-blum : 45, female, member of the christian conservatives (cdu), former administrative judge and mayor of a nearby smaller city. married, one son. political experience on local level.  political aims:  affordable child and after-school care, furthering freiburgs economic strength by promoting our location (france/germany/switzerland), integration of immigrants should happen through making it part of cultural politics, more spaces for kids and teens. she got 32,4% in the first polling round.    urlLink dieter salomon : 42, male, member of the green party (die grünen), studied politics, finance and arts, former member of the state parliament, county parliament and city council. married, one daughter.  political aims:  further area economically by concentrating on excisting eco-friendly solar and wind energy industries, furthering integration through schools, kindergartens and cultural activities, strengthening public transport, careful decisions about new building grounds, additional city council department for cultural affairs, renovate schools, more child and after school care and daycare for the elderly, more social initiatives for kids and teens as well as drug addicts, the mentally ill and homeless. he got 36,7% in the first polling round. he would be the first ever green mayor in a larger german city.     the more i read about him, the more i think dieter salomon might get my vote.  while i am all for more women in politics, and while large bits of heute-blums and salomons programs are basically identical (mirroring the city's opinions and needs), he simply seems to be hitting the point a bit better. within the green party, he's part of the "realos", the more middle of the road greens, whose main goal is to focus on what is achievable instead of wanting unattainable goals. plus he isn't a lawyer. which is a good thing in local politics. what has not influenced me is the fact salomon was born to german-australian immigrants in melbourne. or that you can play pong on his website. :)  aww. i love voting.  so tell me, who would you vote for in these mayoral elections?                who'd get your vote?           on sunday, my city will decide who should be our next mayor. who would you vote for?        gudrun heute-blum; female, conservative, local experience       dieter salomon; male, green, revolutionary, state and local experience              urlLink Current results

         "when the buzzer buzzed just now, i had the idea that it was her, that she somehow knew that i cried in the shower until the hot water ran out and that i wrote a new haiku for her, the first in a long while (for first five months or so, I wrote her at least one haiku a day). i hurried into the hall and stood at the top of the stairs.  the stairs were filled with silence. i waited a long time, telling myself that perhaps she standing on the first stair, paralyzed with fear. i tried to listen for her breathing; it was so quiet i figured i could hear her breathing, assuming she was down there. but she wasnt down there. i know this because i finally went and looked for her. she wasnt there. i knew she wasn't there before i went, but i went anyway, because you never know. or perhaps you do know, but still."     urlLink never read something about buzzers and haikus and people that was so sad. and so brilliantly put.    urlLink michael's  writings often leaves me breathless.

       urlLink Friday Five  is on hold this week. hence last weeks's ones, just because.   1. what are your hobbies?  reading. cooking (well, not at the moment, and never just for myself). working out. pampering myself. my computer. gardening on my balcony.   2. do you collect anything? If so, what?  i own tons of books and cds and self made tapes, but somehow these three don't really count, do they? i don't collect anything per se anymore (considering that i plan to relocate sooner or later, and need to get rid off all the  *fluff*  i collected over the years), but if i do see something nice for my flat (in pink, orange, red or yellow), i most of the time go for it.   3. is there a hobby you're interested in, but just don't have the time/money to do?  i want to get more into yoga and pilates, but can't find a good teacher and feel a bit lonely doing it without one. and one fine day, preferrably before i start having babies, i want to learn how to knit, sew and quilt. right now, i lack the time, need and patience.   4. have you ever turned a hobby into a moneymaking opportunity?  nope.   5. besides web-related stuff (burbs, rings, etc.), what clubs do you belong to?  I'm a member of a gym, a german-australian student-exchange alumni club and a student group on security policy.

      today was probably our final goodbye.  standing in a queue in front of a teller at the state bank, i weighed them in my hands for a final time: german mark coins that had turned up in unexpected places at my parents house, long after the official changeover to the  had been completed.  holding them in my hand while waiting was familiar yet already strange.  it's been four months without them, four months since the changeover, four months with extremely shiny new coins, virginal coins that more and more often don't feature the familiar german eagle, but da vincis measured man, the spanish rey, the dutch queen, the french marianne or -very rarely- beautifully designed flying birds that finland chose for its coins instead. compared to these new coins that have been inhabiting my wallet since january 1st, they looked old and shabby, those last few marks, battered and bruised and used.  among those battered coins, between a couple of 10 pfennig coins, a couple of one pfennig coins, was one one mark coin in its shiny compactness, which always used to be the symbol of the "wirtschaftswunder". with it was one five mark coin, with its familar heaviness, since the 50s lovingly called "heiermann" ("sleepman") as back then, your local sex worker would give you pleasure for the worth of that coin. - hardly anyone knew that that was the explanation behind the coin's well known nickname.  the five mark coin used to be such a nice thing. even though prizes for sex work have risen since the 50's, you'd still get a lot for it. a pack of cigarettes. a high gloss mag. a pizza and a small drink at laubfrosch. holding it, i realised that the "heiermann" is the only thing about our old currency that i miss. it sounds bizarre to miss a coin, but i do.  i still remember that i felt insanely rich when i got an orange ball with yellow dots as a pressie when i was 8: an aunt of mine had taped a 5er coin on every yellow dot on the ball. having a 5er made me feel rich. having a ball with lots of fivers made me feel like a billionaire. the 5er wasn't substituted well by the euro. todays 2 coin is the closest anything comes worth wise, but it just doesn't give you the feeling of being rich. it lacks everything the heiermann had, the size, weight, feel, the connotation, the history.  i handed them over, the fiver and the one mark coin and the pfennig coins, saw them being thrown into the counting and sorting machine by the clerk, their value shown in big green digital numbers once the machine had sorted them into the seperate bags that will bring them to the bundesbank, where they will die and be reborn as new coins or cables. we're german. we recycle our coins.  i got a receipt for my few coins and went to another teller, handed  the receipt to the clerk plus the 50DM bill my dad discovered last friday in the inside pocket of the dark suit he usually wears to funerals. a last feel of the bill as i handed it over, just as battered and used as the coins, the picture of balthasar neumann crumpled.  the 50 DM bill had always felt special, too.  it, too, had always felt like a lot of money. for years, 50DM were a month's worth of pocket money. if you had a bahncard, 50DM bought a return trip to my lover frank. 50DM was enough to make you feel confident in the supermarket, confident that you didn't have to carefully calculate at the cashier,  50DM could easily get you through a weekend or a drunken night out, and  you could pay for the taxi, too. Quite similar to the 5er's -equivalent, a 20 and a 5 bill, while being as much "worth" as the old 50DM bill, don't feel like a whole lot and make you wonder in the supermarket, whether you'll have to pay with your debit card.  the clerk put a stamp on a form, put my 50DM bill in a box, hit a key on his computer, printed out yet another receipt for me, counted 2,78 in front of me. with a leafy sound, the safe sputtered out a 20 and a 5 bill, brandnew, virginal, like the bills you got in the first week of january. fresh from the printing machine. nice and without crinkles.  i took my 27,78, thanked the clerk, and put them in my wallet. the knowledge hitting me, that my wallet will most likely never hold another mark or pfennig or a 50DM bill. instead, it'll hold a more and more diverse assortment of  coins from all over europe. bills and coins that are used by a diverse group of people, in diverse countries. i can pay with that money here in my hometown, and in amsterdam, paris, athens, madrid. this new money unites us. it unites our wallets, unites us in the supermarket, unites us in the fact that we europeans all had to bid our old currencies farewell. europeans in the monetary union, from ireland to finland, from france to spain, from greece to the netherlands, from germany to monaco all had to exchange their last bits of their own currencies, just like i had to, today. knowing that the process whose final stage started four months ago wasn't the end of something, but rather the start of something new and uniting, made it hurt a lot less today, this final goodbye.   goodbye, deutsche mark. you'll be missed. but only a little.

      i bought some slim fast today. please put me into one of these tight little jacket that close at the back. please lock me up in a room with padded walls. please feed me well, with real food.  i haven't gone totally insane: it's not about loosing weight, i haven't bought into their stupid advertising ( "i'll be the happiest person if i loose 5 kg more." ). quite simply, these past 3 days, i've been absolutely terrible about eating, mainly not eating enough because it felt like such a burden to prepare food and to eat it afterwards. blame it on my living alone and being without social control again. i stand in the supermarket and am uninspired and not hungry. i stand in my kitchen and am uninspired and not hungry. i stand at the market and can't afford the fruit that i think i could force myself to eat. as a result i eat very little. i had a total of about one meal a day these past few days. - and that's just not good for my already screwed up metabolism.  this tub of slim fast will mean that i at least get some protein and nutrients, if the terribly artificially treated kind, but at least i'll eat  something  with minimal effort. this is just an add on, not the replacement of anything: i'll keep on struggling to make as many real meals a day and to eat as much fruit and veges as i can manage and afford. but if i can't, i'll have a slim fast drink instead. makes it all at least a wee bit better, hm?  welcome to another bout of disordered eating.

      it turned out to be a melancholic day.  i was full of motivation this morning, but steady rain and unproductive waiting got to me. i should have simply grabbed the phone and pt an end to the waiting, but i didn't, stupid me. it's useless and hurtful this  "let's see whether he'll call"  thing. stupid because it's sowing unreasonable distrust and passive aggression in my heart and mind. stupid as we didn't have a phone date to start with.  so i waited and stayed offline to keep the phone line free till the afternoon, slept on and off for way too long, and listened to "tales of the city" cds. and it got to me, this rainy, cold day. sun was expected, i had brought up all my balcony stuff just last night, expected today's holiday to be a day to sit in the sun and read. and now this. this rain and waiting and loneliness.  rain. and worries about my trip to oz. and worries about a friendship that has been falling to pieces right before my very eyes these past few months. and wondering how to catch up with my online pals after this recent absence. and more rain. and realising that this day could have been spend so much more productively.  yesterday's hype about being back feels a bit fake now, and i wonder whether i'll fall back into old habits and be all lonely and down, or whether i can put a hold to that, and drag myself through all the stuff i hate and fear. i haven't been this physically lonely in a good two months. no cat here, no one to call right now (at least no one i feel like calling, or who would be awake at this time), no desire to eat (at least no over-eating, that's not too bad). and my dispise for this ldr thing hasn't been as big in a good long while, too.  today would have been half as bad had ev been here. grey rainy days are good when you can stay in bed and waste them and not let the world touch you. we've been good at wasting them with sex and tolkien and speedball and some nice cooking and wine (not all simultaneously though).  need a kiss and a cuddle now, need to be held in my sleep and feel his body right there and put my hand on his hipbone. but he isn't here and every mile that's between us and every second that has to pass until we'll be together is a mile, a second too many. i could do without the kiss and cuddle thing for a little while longer if i got a nice decent phone call instead. if i can't get physical closeness, i at least want some aural closeness, an hour of undisturbed talking. but that won't happen tonight. ev is probaly fast asleep and will be for the next few hours until the hospital calls. i can imagine him lying in his bed and wonder what he might be dreaming and what he's been up to all day today and whether my little something has arrived in the mail for him.  i miss him terribly today. i miss feeling love.      you're the colour, you're the movement and the spin. could it stay with me the whole day long. fail with confidence. loose with eloquence and a smile.  i'm not in this movie, i'm not in this song. never. leave me paralysed, love. leave me hypnotised, love.    consequence   urlLink ~the notwist~

      i'm packing up things already to go home yet again. had planned on leaving on the weekend, but hendrik is going home tomorrow, and the prospect of saving 35 and not having to carry my bags through trains sure outweigh staying here 48 hours more. before the parents head off to italy, my mother and i want to go shop for business clothes for me, too, so more time doing that sure is good, too.  that aside, things are pretty much winding down here. strange to know that once i am back from this house & shop guarding mission, and back from my trip to london, it's just a week before i fly out. shocking. i think i should get my to-do-lists done, shouldn't i?  am getting worried about the flights though. the summer cold i assumed i had has turned or is turning into a full blown sinusitis, and my frontal and maxillary sinuses are pulsating with pain. not that they can pulsate, i know that, but anytime i bend forward or move my head, waves of pain well, wave, through my head. still can't hear, got the post-nasal-drip-bad-taste-in-mouth-ear-clogging-swollen-lymphnode- thing happening, and am hating every minute of it with a passion. got an appointment to see my ent on friday. and while i am worried he'll to the two minute check up here's-your-perscription-for-antibiotics thing again (if that happens, i'll scream at him), but am willing to do whatever is needed to make this go away. am just too paranoid about any further ear disasters happening on flights after the ear drum collapse two years ago.  oh well.  in other news, i hope i gave the final blow to the "friendship" with britta today. we had talked on the phone on monday, i had told her i would cook for her on thursday, but when i heard tuesday morn that hendrik was driving home, i send her an email immediately, actually fwding the bit of hendriks eMail as proof, and told her that we'd catch up when i was back from london. next thing in my inbox is a fuming eMail by her, accusing me of lying and  "having my priorities wrong in regards to our friendship" , which prompted me to scream "bitch! bitch! bitch!" for a few minutes. bad timing on her part, for a few moments, i had really wanted to see what was left of our friendship, and next thing she does is this blow-out. her own fault, really. after sleeping over it, i send her an email this morning basically saying  "it was good while it lasted, but now fuck off"  (not in these, but similar words). had wanted to say that for ages. i think she rang at my doorbell today, while the football was on. did i open? nope. you know, i do have my priorities straight: football is more important than her. i am just not interested in making up with her. and have no hesitations of letting her know that.  cruel? maybe. better and healthier for me? sure thing.

      birthdays with a lot of alone time make for reflective moods. still feel that even a day later. hence this bit of intro-and retrospection.      15 Years Ago I...     was in 4th grade at primary school;  spend my summer with my parents in austria and at a riding camp on a farm with my cousin and some friends;  fancied french actor pierre cosso in "cinderella '87";  got my first ever walkman, which was pink; and  loved the pink bike i had been able to afford from the money i got as presents on my first holy communion that year.      10 Years Ago I...     was in 9th grade at grammar school;  spend my summers at summer camp at the castle, with a whole bunch of galpals, and had the best summers of my teen years;  fancied ralf, summer camp group leader, who these days lives in this city and had had a short bad fling with magnus;  would share two pairs of chucks with my friend jane so we'd wear a different coloured show on each foot; and  went to my first u2 concert, zootv on june 4th at dortmund's westfalenhalle.      5 Years Ago I...     had just graduated from high school with a grade of 1.1;  spend my summer as a group leader at the camp at the castle for the last time, in paris at the catholic world youth meeting and in hamburg, visiting d.;  fancied d., despite unsuccessful attempts earlier in the year of getting with my friend tim , kissing simon, and later in the year having the wee little affair with christian;  i was just about to start uni; and  moved in with the flatmate from hell.      2 Years Ago I...     was preparing for my first trip to australia;  was clinically depressed and on trycyclic depressants and pretty much out of it all;  was already very much in love with ev, but terribly stressed because of his ex and the bullshit he let her put him through;  kept a now gone diary at  urlLink opendiary.com ; and  was slowly but surely seperating myself from a big group of people i had thought were my friends.      1 Year Ago I...     was already stuck in the same kind of law school rut i am in now;  started volunteering at pp;  had hoped to spend the summer in australia, which didn't work out;  made the mistake of fleeing to my parents for much of the summer; and  was already seeing dr.k but still pretty down most of the time.      Yesterday I...     turned 24;  took the time to read the sunday paper on the balcony;  talked on the phone with my toyboy twice;  had a couple of nice chats with friends; and  sobbed in front of the tv during  urlLink all you need is love .      Today I...     talked with ev's mother on the phone because he was out;  deep-conditioned my hair;  didn't study enough;  wrote an article on tss for  urlLink scarleteen ; and  had more choc than i've had in the past 6 weeks. Blame mom's birthday pack.      Tomorrow I...     will watch the world cup semi final and cheer for germany;  will hopefully feel good enough to work out;  will hopefully get to speak with the toyboy himself;  will use my fabulous new bag; and  try to be a bit happier than today.      Five Places I've Lived...(for more or less long periods of time)     duisburg, nrw, germany  la mata, torrevieja, spain  christchurch, new zealand  freiburg, bw, germany  melbourne, vic, australia      Top Five Biggest Worries At the Moment...     what my stay in australia will be like and how my relationship with ev will be influenced by the not so ideal living situation;  how i will finance my studies in australia;  how i will face and manage to work through the social anxiety i have developed in the past 2 years and whether i really am as messed up as i fear i am;  how i will manage to finally graduate as quickly as possible; and  whether law is the right profession for me to start with.      Top Five Biggest Joys At the Moment...     my relationship with ev & the love i feel for him and feel coming from him;   urlLink my upcoming trip to see him ;  summer;  feeling and seeing my muscles move when working out;  spitting my thoughts out in pixels right here; and  the improving friendship with my brother, as it is finally looking like we might finally start to treat each other on an adult to adult basis.      (survey from  urlLink aroha ; aroha btw is maori and means love. fabulous name.)  it's terrible to feel like i haven't made any major steps and developments or reached any major achievements in the past year or so. instead, it feels like i have been regressing more and more and crawling further and further back into the ridiculously cliché shell cancers like me call their home.  but then this has been a constant feeling for that period of time. i should have gotten used to it by now.

      last night, i somehow ended up watching  urlLink http://www.hbo.com/docs/911/">the hbo docu: In Memoriam: New York City, 09.11.01.  on  urlLink cnn .   it's a collage of film and photo material from more than 100 people who who were in ny that day, the well-known material we've all seen more than often enough (the cameran fliming firefighters, lifting his camera up when he hears a noise, first to catch the first flight hitting the wtc/the second plane coming in, in an almost elegant curve, hitting the second tower/the giant cloud coming through the streets, the cameraperson having to be dragged into a coffeesho, the clouds swirling in front of the window. etc..) amplified by numerous home videos nyers made that day, un-cut and un-dubbed. those bits are the most haunting, those first bits of film with its unfiltered statements of shock and fear. a man who woke up from the noise of the first crash staning on his balcony filming the wtc on fire talking about his fears of www3.  the collective scream when the first tower came down. oh god. oh god. oh god. people in cars in brooklyn, seeing what was happening from afar.  there's material made from a fdny helicopter of the roof, with an interview of the pilot who is in tears explaining why they could not land on the roof to save people. there's material from inside the wtc, people hurrying through the lobby. there are voice overs with phone messages from people made stuck in the building.  "hi lisa, this is peter, there is a fire in the world trade center and we are stuck in the office and i don't know whether i will get out, but i wanted to tell you that i love you. i love you so much. tell the kids that i love them, too. i love you."    these "new" bits make this so affecting. the extensive media coverage in the days and weeks after the attacks made me believe that i had seen it all, made me numb, made me want to turn my head, hit the programme switch, hide away. it sounds horrible to say it, but i had had enough of the countlessly repeated material in slow-mo, for weeks on tv. it had turned into a reality, a fact. the shock had worn off, it had gotten even more surreal then seeing it life. it had transcended into an icon. i had started to not want to see it, just like i can not bear to hear the standard phrases and catchwords that developed in the aftermath, took on a life of their own, were like a mantra repeated again and again and again, even in the most unrelated of contexts, like when  us snowboarders did a gold/silver/bronze-triple at the olympics ( "this means a lot to our nation, especially after the tragic events of nine eleven"  or whatever that guy exactly said). choose any combination of "cowardly terrorist attack on freedom". "the attacks". "september 11th". "nine eleven". make me throw up. i surely do not want to disrespect what has happened, but i can't stop myself from hating the rhethorics, while being unable to avoid them, even as i write this.  the entire docu is interset with interviews, mainly of rudy giuliani and his staff, as there is lots of actual material from the day of the attacks of his staff and where they were going when. i can't help but still be amazed by his statesmanly handling of it, obvious in the footage of him and his staff trying to figure out what was happening, constantly moving, holding masks to their faces. i am impressed by the calm in the eye of the storm that he was, the un-dramatic yet compassionate and emotional words he found in the first press conference.  "the losses will be greater than we can bear" . those pres conferences when he counted the first great losses that were already obvious, many leading members of the PA and fdny.  the only downside of some of the interviews with some of giuliani's staff members is the music they are set to. sounds superficial to criticize that, but in my opinion, the sickly sweet weeping string music is just not needed: the words are enough, and would have come across far better without the background music intended to induce even more emotions. makes for a disturbingly almost vomit inducing combination; the music makes the words seem pathetic and makes the viewer loose focus. but that's the only flaw, really.  the one hour docu ends with footage of memorial services and burials. most moving for me personally the memorial service of the brokerage company  urlLink cantor fitzgerald ; the firm who lost most of their employees at their ny office.   now, a day later, i find the one picture i can not get out of my head again is the same as ever since: it is the people jumping out of the wtc, from the floors above the hitting point. that material was left undubbed, too. you can hear a man in the off tell the cameraman to stop filming the jumping people, telling him that this was too horrible to be kept on film. you see people react to the jumpers. you hear people describe the sounds of when they hit the ground. you see footage of rudy giuliani turn away in shock when he sees the jumping people. these desperate people jumping to their death from their offices above where the plane hit still affect me the most.   it is the photo of the man with the white jacket and dark pants, taken by ap photojournalist  urlLink richard drew , believed to show  urlLink norberto   urlLink hernandez , pastry chef at "windows on the world", falling head down, captured in the middle of his fall, his arms by his side, the building in the background a bit blurry -yet still there- as he rushes past. the one thing affecting me even more was a still photo of what was left of those who jumped after they reached the sidewalk. that black and white stillphot, shown for maybe 5 seconds, splatters on the concrete and a little wall, clothing apparently thrown from somewhere, things that appear to have been body parts, had almost as much an impact on me as seeing the first tower collapse, live on cnn, paralysed in front of my telly, standing in the middle of my room in tears, hand in my mouth to stop the screaming shaken by the horror and extend of what was going on, 9 months ago. i do not want to know what the rescue people had to see. what they still see in their dreams.  i never wrote anything on september 11th in here. i had just watched, like the rest of the world from afar, my words seemed so insufficient and useless in the turmoil that those hours, days and weeks were.  i still feel the same about writing about it. but i just had to let this out, after last nights unexpected look back and reliving of that tuesday, 9 months ago.

      beautiful thunder storms are moving in.  started out in the northeast, with lightning that seemed like the reflection of real lightning somewhere else. very pretty to look at. but it's a real thunderstorm, and now it's moving in and you can feel it. it just started to rain, the lighting is getting brighter and brighter, thunder coming closer an closer, and the air smells like electricity and summer.  what a spectacle, indeed.  feel like running naked through the rain  urlLink again . too bad my untanned body will shine in a bright white when lit by lighting, should i decide to at least be naked in the rain on my balcony.  bummer.

      today was good.  not spectacular, the world didn't revolve around me -which used to be the egoistic view a younger me had of my birthdays- but it was fine enough. a sunny and hot day, still above 30°C, thankfully less humid than in the past week, bright blue skies, and i spend much of the day on the balcony, in the shade, reading, relaxed and pretty much happy with the world.  quite a few people called, smsed or emailed. evan called five minutes to midnight, wanting to be quicker than my mom, knowing how much i wanted to talk to him first on my birthday. i read his sobby & kitschy card ( "happy birthday to someone who makes my life complete" ) and admired the gomez ticket he had drawn into it. aw. :) unpacked the pack from my mom which in which my brother's presents were, too, and all the while talked with evan, for a whole hour. was lovely, even though i was teribbly tired and even though it was 8am for him, not exactly a time when he's in a really talkative mood. missed him so much last night and today. i simply can not wait until i am there, can not wait to be near him again. alas it is not long: from now on, time will fly by with everything that still needs to be organised, i am completely sure about it.  spend the morning quite normally, talking with beppie, going to the train station to get the sunday paper and some bread and cake for the afternoon (put my fab new bag to use for the first time!). tina came by in the afternoon and we sat on the balcony and had cake and champagne and it was splendid.  now the day is almost over, i made myself some lovely warm mozzarella sammies and watched  urlLink all you need is love  while on the phone with tina. rarely watch the show ever since ev and i went on it, it either makes me sob or want to throw up. today it mainly sparked sobbing, they had the really adorable story of a woman from germany who found a necklace with an engraved pendant on a beach in cuba. amazingly, the show managed to track down the middle aged canadian woman who had gotten the pendant from her husband, a police officer in vancouver. the pendant was actually a vancouver police badge that carried his id#  that's how the show managed to track him and her down. they surprised her in the show, the necklace had been stolen while she was on holiday in cuba, and she never thought she'd get it back. her hubbie put the necklace around her neck and told her that the fact the necklace had returned after all these years showed  "that love can surpass everything, even travel around the world" . it was absolutely adorable, and as sobby as it sounds. other memorable thing was the usual  "flying in the long distance boyfriend from australia"  thing. this time they asked two ldr girlfriends to re-enact the rain-kissing scene from spiderman to win tickets to fly to their beloved ones. for each the upside down hanging spiderman was the other one's boyfriend. quite mean. but entertaining. got to remember to write to jenny, the staff person who organised our show thing, that i'm heading out to oz next month. or maybe i should wait till we have some more news. he.  so today really hasn't been as bad as i expected it to be like. a party would have been good, being already on my way to oz would have been better, but it was ok the way it was, if a bit lonely.  but i'm ok. and don't feel that 24 is any different to 23 yet.

      i'm physically feeling like shit, and have done so for the past 36 hours or so.  yesterday morning i woke up at 5:30am, unable to sleep again and with a bizarre kind of sore throat from hell that had started to flare up thursday night. was dumb enough to think that a)it really wasn't that bad and that b) it really wasn't that hot either, and went for a 60 minute bodyststyling class at the gym. big mistake. i had trouble breathing, was terribly exhausted halfway through the class and had scarily low blood pressire most of the time (those silver-black flashes in front of my eyes were a constant experience throughout the class). should have probably stopped after 10 minutes, but idiotic me didn't. and now i am apparently in the fangs of a  urlLink summer cold .  don't feel like jotting down the gory details, but i must say there are  few things i can imagine that could be more annoying and tiring than stuffed up sinuses, a persistent cough, earache and a headache in humid 35°C weather. thankfully the sore throat is a bit better. am still not hungry though and had to force mysed to eat at all. attempted some lukewarm chicken soup (sucks in hot weather, but what's a girl to do?), only to -in my headached out state- knock it all over my carpet and theeby break my favourite cup  (an east carolina university medical school cup which was a present from lou, the first person i ever met online & irl, a few years back). bloody hell.  in any way, the only real home remedy i've been able to force myself to is the non-stop drinking. am nearing 6l of fluid intake already.  urlLink most advice on the common cold  is just not viable for this weather. tried to take a nap this afternoon (or rather: collapsed on my bed in the afternoon), which wasn't the best idea ever because i just drifted in an out of sleep for a good hour, felt terribly hot and could just not relax. ack.  anyway. don't feel like whining any more.  off to drink some more water and have a lukewarm shower. am still unsure whether i should head to bed early (or at least attempt to). wonder whether ev will call at midnight to wish me a happy birthday. bet my mom will, even though i told her not to.  oh well. at least i could open my pack and card then, too.

       such a good saturday so far, my health aside.  went for a little saturday morn shopping trip and picked up some earrings at the jeweller's i had selected last night, a little birthday pressie for myself. yesterday, i had enquired and looked at some rings and stones and setting variations and the like...so today, i decided to try some on, just because. so i tried some rings on, and realised the type of ring i had fancied all along, a simple white gold band with a low set brilliant cut stone is just right. tried on a variety of rings with a variety of stone weights, but in all honesty, anything more than 0.25 ct looked kinda wrong on the long thin finger i have, and on a person my age anyway. looked like i had gone on a rampage through my grandmas jewellery box. the ring i liked most was an affordable 219, while having a first class stone. definitely not too bad. so enjoyable to talk engagement rings with the nice lady who served me. was impressed by how well i was treated customer service wise. i think i'm looking particularly young at the mo, in a bleached denim skirt and tank top and flip-flops and with loose hair, i guess i hardly look the 24 i'll turn tomorrow, or the lawyer i'll be soon. oh well. throughoutly lovely experience, and the earrings i bought just rock. they aren't anything special, just two fake brilliant cut stones set in silver, one half of the setting highly polished, the other half matte. very cute, and a good substitute for the pearls i lost lately.  went on a stroll through the market and bought some fresh fruit & veges (hope the strawberries i bought today are better than those last week) and a potted sunflower (just couldn't bear to look at my bare windowstill anymore, one lonely sunflower is better than nothing, me thinks). got more groceries, a couple of teas from the health food shop (an ayuvedic licorice root tea to help my sore throat and an ayuvedic ginger lemon mix, too) and on my way home bought a 27 year old book on cognitive behavioural therapy in depression at a used book sale to profit  urlLink ai . all really nice. town was really full, but everyone seemed to be in a funky good mood: lots of musicians on every street corner (including a trio of gals all under 8 plaing their violins, which sounded absolutely horrendous but was adorable as hell), the cafes full, and several wedding parties in front of the mayors office, inclduing two guys seemingly getting their partnership registered, and their wedding guests. Everything felt very vibrant and alive and ready to do things today.  must be the weather. it's warm and a lot less humid than the days before, and korea won the football and now turkery and senegal are trying their best, too. only thing that sucks is that i am still feeling way too sick. while my sore throat is better and i can at least speak again, i know have a totally stuffy nose and breathing problems and a headache. welcome to the world of the summer common flu. nothing big, but terribly annoying.  alas, there are things to be done: a football game to watch, dishes to do, a kitchen and bathroom to clean, a hungry stomach to feed and an email from a friend asking for advice needing to be answered. shall be a slow, good day today. more later.

      today, as i walked from the post office back home, i passed through an underpath.  a busker was standing down there, playing his guitar and singing. sure not as well as the orginal artist, but with lots of passion and love and desire.    You bury your treasure where it can't be found  But your love is like a secret that's been passed around   There is a silence that comes to a house where no one can sleep   I guess it's the price of love I know it's not cheap   Baby Baby Baby light my way  I remember when we could sleep on stones  Now we lie together in whispers and moans When I was all messed up  And I heard opera in my head Your love was a light bulb Hanging over my bed     and with that, the guy with the guitar truly made my day.

She's also on many occasions, put things in a new light for me personally, and made me rethink some things.  Sound thinking and an easy-to-get-along-with way about her are what I think of, with Alaska. I'd bet most everyone around the site is happy she's in her corner.

      all that girly fluff aside, i'm not too well.  it's loneliness, another case of  "the mauves" , missing evan. nothing i can change to well this very moment.  tina called a little while ago, and i was snarky and didn't even feel the need to change it. i was terribly annoyed by her reasoning on the most irrelevant issue of all; we argued about -please don't laugh universe- waterbirths. tina was watching "birth story" on tv, told me to turn it on, too, and then got all judgemental about the going-ons. she deemed that the waterbirth the mother in the show had chosen - in a hospital birth tub , mind you- was unhygienic and disgusting - "you're lying in your own blood! you'll have to give birth to the placenta in there too!"  gasp! i replied that she should better not get pregnant if she deemed blood during birth intolerable. giving birth to another human involves bodily fluids and blood and amniotic water. it's needed. it's normal. it might not be the best thing about giving birth, but hey, it's life. it's magical. so what? then dissected each of her arguments until she got all snarky and told me she preferred if we agreed to disagree. guess i'm just a bit too alterna-birth for her. or rather: she's not quite enlightened yet.  i'm well aware though that that really wasn't the reason for the quarreling. the underlying reason is the fact she has not made a single move indicating that she plans to re-establish the plans we had for this weekend (i.e. the skate class and my birthday) before her brother said he'd come down here. he's cancelled his plans now, you know? so are we going back to our initial plans? apparently not.  maybe i am subconciously sabotaging this friendship and being all kindergarten in order to not miss her that much when she's gone after the summer. could very well be. i feel neglected and unloved and unneeded. lovely.  a similar snarky thing happened on the phone with my mother the other day. she has been making plans for october that again involve holidays for my dad and her, and me looking after shop/house/cat while they are away. i wouldn't mind it as much if it weren't in the first week of my last fucking semester here. i just can not stay away from uni yet again because they want to go on their fucking fifth holidays of the year. i told her there is no way i can stay away again, and she gave me the usual guilt trip, which worked as nicely as ever. sure i care about my cat. sure i care about their business. but fucking hell, let me live my life. i want to get away from here, i need to get away from here, i need to get my fucking degree and if you don't want me to leave but start working in your bookstore, then fucking say so. just don't try to sabotage my life and plans with your fucking holidays. i told you not to make plans that involve me from september on. so don't!  argh.  i'm not angry though. not really. it's the usual sick and tired of sick and tired and wanting to function and to finally get this degree and pack my things and get away from here and partly re-invent myself. even though i practically  am  away from so much already.  you know, part of it is that i miss evan. i can't even put into words how much i do. i've told myself a thousand times how bad it is to really  need  another person, but i do need him. life is better with him because of what's between us. i miss the communication and rapport we have when we're in the same room. i miss his mind and his voice and his hands and the rest of his body. the bad thing is that i already miss thing we will not have once i am there. we won't have the easy coupled up life we have when he's here. we won't be sleeping with together and next to each other (at least not without guilt like we were 14). i worry about what that will do to us again.  so pointless to get all sad and gloomy about us now. it's about 4 1/2 weeks until i'm there, nothing to whine about, no reason to be sad. it's going well. it'll all be well. it'll work out.  made the mistake of reading around the remains of my now long gone opendiary today.   " august 29th 2000  - this isn't it. what is happening right now is not what i wanted. yesterday was fine. went to phillip island, saw my first koala, heard the first kookaburra, saw and heard my first penguin. a nice day on the road. but something last night ruined it and this morning everything was wrong. just wrong. i feel i should stay here and not go to sydney, even though we wouldn't spend much time together anyway and get a chance work through what we have to work through. this is all screwed up. severely. so what was it? i don't know. being turned down again? i really don't know. i should have gotten used to it right now, that he doesn't want me near. he just doesn't feel how scared i am. and he doesn't see how it hurts, in regard of the fact that we have so little time left. i didn't want this. i just didn't. listen to too much radiohead.....bulletproof i wish i was....and if i could be..who you wanted..... if i could fucking  be what e wants. if i could be what makes him happy."    i try to remind myself it's all going to be different now, we've changed, we've grown, we're better, we know what to expect, we're sure. i try to remind myself that the distance that bothered me when i wrote the previous wasn't just due to the lack of privacy but to all the unresolved issues between us and the ones he had with jen. but i have a hard time convincing myself of that in the wee hours of the morning.  i feel the empty space around me and inside me where he should be. his absence lurks in the background and creeps in on me in moments like these when night is falling and the moon rising and i feel so far away from the world, sitting at my desk seeing no lights in the coutyard because all my neighbours are out there having a life.  i think i just need a good long reconnecting conversation with my boy to remind me of the goodness that's between us.  i can not wait to get off that plane and feel him again and the things that are between us and head to the gomez concert the very same evening, doubtlessly crying during  we haven't turned around" . life will be better then.  why can't i just skip these next four weeks? please?     wenn man zu lang allein ist kommen komische ideen es gibt zwar grund zu leiden doch wer will das schon hören hab all meinen rest zusammengepackt mich zusammen genommen war gerade mal dabei allein klar zu kommen  wie aus dem nichts tauchtest du plötzlich vor mir auf wie aus dem nichts schnappten wir beide nach luft  wenn man zu lang allein ist kommen komische ideen man wird verschroben, das können die wenigsten verstehen war gerade dabei den hundeblick wegzujagen diese gedanken mit gewalt aus dem kopf zu schlagen  wie aus dem nichts liefen wir uns über den weg wie aus dem nichts blieben wir voreinander stehen  nicht mehr dran gedacht nicht mehr drauf gehofft keinen zentimer-, millimeter mehr daran geglaubt  wenn man zu lang allein ist kommen komische ideen   "wie aus dem nichts"  ~nationalgalerie~

      went for a 60 minute  urlLink swim  early this morning, which was highly enjoyable and refreshing. wonder about two things though:  can i go again tomorrow?  (we got a wee little thunderstorm a little while ago which might be the end of our current heatwave) and  has my little swimming excursion completely ruined my hair?  yes, terribly girlish to worry about the latter, but i am growing it for the first time in my life. i am new to this intense  looking after your hair  thing. the slight green shimmer i noticed in my highlights this afternoon sure set off me off in a frantic deep-conditioning mode. 2hrs with  urlLink john frieda's  sheer blonde deep conditioning treatment didn't quite do the trick, so now my hair looks all weird, as it's been smeared with a sample of the killer expensive  urlLink marlies moeller  overnight hair treatment, which my hair literally soaked up in an instant. wonder what it will be like tomorrow, after the emulgating and the washing. can't be worse than now.  right now, my hair looks like the latest trend for scarecrows. or like that of a model at a paris runwayshow. he.

       this time three years ago, i was having an affair.   today and yesterday were days full of intense memories, sparked by the hot weather, by music i hadn't listened to in years, by being dissapointed by a friend and too much time alone.  while pondering about my birthday on sunday, i remembered that three years ago, the person to congratulate me first was not d., my partner back then, but c.   three years ago, i was having an affair.   those were the last months of being with d. things were coming to an end, had been coming to an end for a while. the basis of our relationship had been eroded by him making all major decisions without me, by his warped view of me, by his warped view of our future. i didn't quite dare to take my things and leave, and ended up in an affair instead, sunconsciously looking for a catalyst to make me end the relationship with d.  i met c. in a group setting through a close mutual friend, away from both our hometowns, found him interesting and attractive, liked his quick and creative mind, desired his attention. i wonder whether part of my attraction to c. was actually our mutual friend, who i had longed for and lusted after for a good 3 years before this all happened. being with c. was being in our mutual friend's territory in a way. warped, i know. but probably more to the point than i'd like to admit. in any way, the attraction seemed to be mutual, and somehow, we ended up outside, it was a lush summer evening, and things developed from there.  my mind is all confuse can't seem to choose what's right or wrong . it wasn't spectacular, but nice enough. a lack of safer sex supplies (my partner wasn't there, so why should i carry my kit around?) limited our activities. and in all honesty, i'm not too sure whether i'd have gone along with it. while i had emotionally moved away from d. quite a while ago, it still felt like cheating: unfair. i broke all arrangements d. and i had made in our two years together. it wasn't the first time i had "slipped" while with d. there had been others before, i had fallen in love once, in lust twice, looked for re-assurance, too.  home again after the slip with c., i decided it was all going to be a one off thing. despite that, a few days later, i found myself writing emails to c, bringing what had happened up, indicating i had liked it a lot. a few days later, we were on the phone. ended up being on the phone for four hours.  that night, drum & bass being the soundtrack from the club in my courtyard, was the start of a phone/online experience like none before or after. it was insane, intense and stupid. it felt beautiful while it lasted. had they been in english, these eMails could have gone straight into the fiction section of  urlLink scarletletters .  the day after the phone call, i eMailed him again. unfortunately i don't have all the mails i send him back then, i didn't have my own computer back then, and hence don't know what exactly i wrote him. from what he wrote that day, i gather that he read one of his short stories to me on the phone, that we discussed relationships and the upcoming solar eclipse and what had happened. it's the most hamless of all the emails he wrote. he.  i wrote mine at the puter pools at uni and got regularly disconnected when writing pages and pages of replies, red faced and flushed and excited. pages full of confessions and desires and questions on how things should develop in and between the lines. i still have all his mails. i am still amazed by how daring we both were, by how my feeling were awakened again while still being in the fucked up relationship with d., by the desire and lust that nearly drips out off these mails.   we started being on the phone every day. emailed several times a day. to share the cost of calls, we'd stop every hour so the callee could call the caller. d. started to wonder why my line was always busy late in the evening, and i took on calling him when c. and i were making our phone breaks. that bit felt terribly deceitful, was terribly deceitful. but i had turned that bit in my head off, most of the time, and somehow seperated the screwed up 2 year old ldr with d. from the sizzling ldr stuff between c. and me. i wanted hours and hours of c.'s voice on the phone. wanted more and more of his intense emails. didn't care i was tired all the time from staying up till 4am with him on the phone and waking up from dreams in which i was still on the phone with him. one night, he told me all about his family. his father's suicide. his mom's schizophrenia. the trouble with his brother.   c. called me at midnight on my 21st birthday, and was the first to congratulate (d. didn't call until sometime the next day), a few hours later, when the little party i had had was over, c. and i were on the phone again, and i remember what it felt like to tell him that i couldn't get him out of my head and wanted to continue what had started, wondering whether i was making a fool out of myself: it felt like jumping into an ice-cold pool, only to realize it really was a warm jacuzzi and that i had had nothing to fear. whereas being with d. made me feel trapped and locked in, i felt free and accepted and carried by c.  i still have an email from july 5th 1999 in which i ponder how and why things developed the way they did; a true morning after email, c. and i had had the most exquisite phone sex you can imagine the night before.  i was further away from d. in these phone calls than while c. and i had been kissing. the calls were unfaithfulness at its best. what happened over the glassfibre cables was more intimate than any kissing, any making-out, any groping. we let all defences down. and good lord, did that feel spectacular.  it wasn't all sweet and sexy and erotic though, july 6th in contrast shows the guilt i felt over the betrayal and pondered about what i should do (knew the only way out anyway), and how much i worried about c. thinking i might enjoy the double-play. the sex with c. aside, i hated every minute of the double-play, as exciting as it was.   three years ago, i was having an affair.   things with d. were deteriorating, obviously. i can't remember specifics, just bitd of horrible weekends here and in d.'s new hometown. sex i didn't want but felt obliged to have, evil comments intended to hit were it hurts most, emptiness the size of the grand canyon between us.  d. and i broke up, finally, several weeks overdue, one weekend in his new town. i drove him to work, the worst of all songs  "time to say goodbye"  on the radio. i was sad and tired but already feeling the relief of it being over, and felt the relief the 300kms home.  but instead of making the way ready for a new relationship with c., the breakup meant breaking away from him, too. i just couldn't do it. i suddenly felt threatened by what had seemed promising the week before. i felt under pressure by his wishes, i just couldn't start all over again, as much as i had needed the glorious last few weeks with him. instead of finally seeing him again in real life, we never got around to make that real. instead of watching the solar eclipse together, like planned, i ended up in bed with one of my best mates that day. i needed to get the relationship with d. out of my head, so i screwed j. lustfully but relationship less. full of love, but without commitment. and good grace, did it feel good. i remember the night at my place.  "and in your eyes i can see what's on my mind" . a sunny saturday morning in his flat, after a night of walking through his beautiful hometown which felt like paris, just smaller, a night of booze, and thc and feeling the sheepskin rug and sex. a morning that felt good. it was the good kind of love between two friends. the only thing that was missing though was "being-in-love". had that been there, it would have been perfect.  when i had finished the relationship with d., there just was no room for being in love, at all. not for j. not for c. for no one. just for me and my egoism.  i never told d. what had been going on. it wouldn't have mattered in face of all the bullshit that was between us anyway. indeed i used c. as the catalyst to end my relationship with d. i needed him for that. i still feel guilty for that and still don't have any excuses or justifications. it sounds terrible to say that, but by projecting what i was missing with d. on c., by living out what i was missing with d. on the phone with c.   three years ago, i was having an affair.   an affair that that couldn't be transformed into real life. when c. and i finally met again, i think i was already with ev. the differences between c. and me were starkly obvious. his expectations were, too. it never got to be. above all, i felt sorry, for the hurt i caused, for dissapointing his expectations, for not being what he wanted me to be. for being faulty and using hum to get out.   three years ago, i was having an affair.   through glassfibre wires and eMail programs. an affair, that i still remember fondly. an affair i feel sad about because i had been so unfair. an affair i feel good about because it taught me how to be open again and awoke parts of me long believed dead.   three years ago, i was having an affair.   it seems like so much longer ago. i can not see myself doing the kind of double-play again. can not see myself in uni with my partner a few metres away, checking eMails from someone else who excites me more than the entire weekend with my partner. can not see myself being so secretive. can not see myself being so un-whole, see myself so betraying. strangely enough, with ev, for the first time ever, i am not looking for re-assurance with someone else. i don't feel like missing out. don't feel limited but safe. feel completely happy as a twosome and can not see myself being unhappy in it.  for the first time ever, i feel whole in a relationship.   but three years ago, i wasn't and was having an affair.  i was a different me back then.

      i'm sad because a friendship is becoming shallow, just as huge changes are looming in the future.  and i hate every minute of it. let me be blunt: if you  want  (and it looks like you do) all this shallow-no-i-already-have-plans-for-your-birthday-let's-not-do-something-then-i-called-but-didn't-leave-a-message-bullshit, then don't expect me to be there when you are in need.  tis as easy as that. honestly.

      it's time to toughen up.  europe is in the middle of a heatwave, and my lovely hometown is reaching new temperature records: we're the hottest (we're all pretty hot all year round anyway) city on the hottest june day since they started recording temps.  today we hit (and are still hitting) 38°C. i haven't done much all afternoon besides sitting or lying in my darkened room in front of my small fan, wearing at the most a strapless bikini (shoulders still way too burned to let anything touch them) and sipping cool water (and looking at wedding dresses online, i admit it). there's no wind outside, it feels like the air's just standing still and you walk into walls. the nights aren't much of a relief: it only  "cooled down"  to about 24°C last night. hey-ho. for once i find a wee bit of comfort in not having another warm sweaty human being next to me in bed, who'd warm up my fresh from the freezer sheet too quickly.  i really shouldn't be whining though but get used to it instead.  if you add air-con (which is almost non existent in private households over here) this is what summers will be like once i have moved to australia. it'll be over 40°C some days. over 30°C most days. i'll have to work then and won't be able to laze in front of the puter in a bikini and have lukewarm showers every few hours. i'll also be somewhere where i'll have to be diligent about sunscreen every single day of the year. i honestly thought i was good enough about it, until this weekend. my shoulders and face and head still prove me otherwise. i've been spraying myself with ambre solaire sunscreen spray for sensitive kid skin with spf 30 in regular intervals today. i need to do so every day.  and another thing to do: ev told me i had to toughen up and stop whining. and what a bummer, he's right.

      on my way to dr.k today, i again stared at  "the dress"  in the shop window of "la dolce vita" for a couple of minutes.   urlLink kitto  thinks i should just go in and try it on. and i am tempted. terribly tempted. somehow it feels like it were cheating to do that before we ever got formally engaged. it feels like something to be done with a pal or with mom. not just plain me walking into the store trying it on alone.  it really isn't the kind of dress i'd ever imagined myself wearing. the neckline is higher than i thought i'd ever like it on that kind of dress (and is the only thing i might want to get changed -into a boatneck or so- came it ever that far) but good lord, is it beautiful. the beading is beautifully made. the train is absolutely gorgeous. it's sleek and simple, yet not plain.  ah.   urlLink just see it for yourself.  it's made by  urlLink pronovias .  kitto, don't you want to come over? just for a little wedding-dress-trying-on-session?  please? :)

      i'm tired and sunburned and really need a rest now, but what a weekend this was.  jampacked with goodthings, sun and fun. makes it a bit more bearable that i'm tired and terribly burned. so much happened since thursday and i haven't had the time to reflect on it nearly enough.  the reunion on friday was good. far better than ever expected. the girl gang met up at tati's place beforehand, which was a nice warm up. in a way, it was like no time had passed since we last had sat together while at the same time being  completely  different to what things were like back then. the girls haven't changed that much. yes, the haircuts are different, martina is queer now, and jane has this pretty babybelly, tati is finally successful jobwise, biene is not jane's closest mate any longer... but the core of everyone just hasn't changed much these past 5 years.  we fell into familiar chatter, laughed about old pictures, biene got as quickly drunk as ever, tina made a point of always kissing her girlfriend (after all, i was the one who had missed out on her big coming out event) and everyone touched jane's belly.  when we headed to the bar later on, it was nice to have had the re-connection with the girls beforehand, we could all spend the evening with others and come back together more talk. had lovely conversations with axel (who's a full fledged geek now), meike (of all people), sabine, isa, ina, simone and a bunch of other gals, laughed with marcel. had a lenghty conversation with simon and brought up old times with him. nicole told me about what she's doing. in general, i made an effort of listening, and what i told others was goodstuff - that i'll be done soon and then move to australia. kept things open enough to be comfortable for me. the only taxing moment was a short discussion with deniz, who -being a law student herself- wanted to know in depth what i was doing. but that went well, too. the only one who really annoyed me was wolfgang, who sat down next to me, inquired whether i was still with andersen (his motivation obviously being his desire to tell me that i am as  urlLink screwed as the company ) and then went on to tell me how he's the rising star at bosch and will be doing some work for them in sao paulo. he said he wasn't sure whether he would ever return, because brasil was so great. not that he's been there yet. i smiled during his showing off and just kept repeating how happy i was for him, and that was that. it really was hilariously entertaining, even though i still haven't figured out what his point was. wolfgang was the only annoying thing, really.  when the party was winding down, filiz, tati, biene and me proceeded to the pub where we used to hang out when we were teens. insert time warp here. the drummer from a band where an ex used to sing stood there, just like he did 10 years ago, still chatting up 15 year olds. the only difference is that he's now 10 years older. seeing that made me happy that i left hometown.  it really was a good night. not spectacular, not terribly important, but interesting. will try to stay in touch with the girls at least. will make an effort of seeing both jane and martina when i'm there next month.  saturday was a rushed day until i finally sat on the train in the late afternoon, terribly tired. arrived here in unitown at 11:30pm, and getting off the air-conditioned train was like walking into an ovem. it was still well over 25°C, without the slightest breeze. was 1am until i had thrown everything out of my bags and was finally in bed and a meagre 4 hours later, i was up and running and on the train to geneva by 6am. the train ride was stunning: the views (ravines, lakes, mountains) already made the early start worth it, and i dozed a little, read a little and tried to understand the little kids sitting nearby speaking swissgerman.  arrived in geneva just after ten, and met grant straight away - we immediately fell into familiar conversation and didn't stop until i hopped back on the train in the late evening. quite lovely. the city is breathtakingly beautiful. it's a lot more french than any other swiss city i've been to, but has a certain charme that's hard to describe. - the grand hotels and banks and watch shops on the banks of the lac lemain and the rivers....terribly pretty. the city showed off in style, too: perfect bright blue skies, perfect sunshine, perfect views of mont blanc, perfectly windstill so that the jet d'eau could reach the full 140m that thing is hight.  the day was spend with lots of walking along the lake and the rhone and l'arve, regular stops at cafes for drinks, lunch at a posh little cafe at the jardin anglaise watching ireland vs. spain on a big screen with several hundred others, mainly spaniards. very funky, very european, very relaxing to enjoy wine and fresh homemade gnocci and cheer for ireland, pondering what the family would think could they see us. impressed grant by being able to fully communicate with everyone in french. he. :) we later went on a boat tour and admired the estates on the lake, had good views of the un buildings, walked through the botanical garden and stood at the spot where empress elisabeth was stabbed to death.  somehow i had expected geneva to be all noveau riche and uptight, but instead, it was a party out there: the lakeside promenade was packed with people from all around the world having fun, swimming, tanning, playing music or doing capoeira. it felt alive, multicultural and happy and good. quite lovely. like the tiny capital village of the world that geneva is.  caught a train home a little before eight: by that time both grant and i were exhausted and tired, he probably even more so than me because of  jetlag. we both were totally burned, too, and i could hit myself for being so dumb to not re-apply sunscreen, even though i doubt that would have helped much - the stuff i used appears to have been old, and now i'm pink all over. nice. got a nice goodie bag from grant, too: a bottle of whine for my dad,  urlLink bombers  mags, a quantas business class travel kit (i'm such a sucker for these things!) and evs pressie for my birthday. the paper bag broke just as i was ready to hop on the train, but a terribly kind lady gave me a sturdy fold up bag as a present. how absolutely rocking: i hope she understood my thanks in a variety of languages.  the train ride turned out to be funky, too: saara, a finnish girl studying in basel started talking to me because she thought i migth be finnish, too. we talked the entire three hours until basel, about a wide variety of things - ldrs, geneva, being away from home, and plan to meet again in the next few weeks here in unitown. a rare kind of trainmeeting - i thouroughly enjoyed every minute of it.  and now my glorious weekend is over, i'm back home, still haven't caught up on sleep, am popping nsaids and drinking water like mad in an effort to not feel the pain, and wish i could have stayed longer in geneva.  having a life is good stuff, i tell you.

       re-create caro's look of the day in two simple steps    combine   a perfect five day old two-layered l'oreal bronze sublime fake tan + 32°C + sun + walking through geneva (any other town with a lakeside -for added sun exposure- will do)+ sweat + movement of clothing on arms, tummy and between breasts =   the  urlLink vitiligo  look!    now add   roughly 16 hours of bright sunshine - working sunscreen (which will give you bright red burned shoulders + bright red burned face + bright red burned chapped lips + bright red line on head where sidepart is + white rings around eyes where sunnies were) =   the "caro-is-too-dumb-to-use-sunscreen-properly" look!   off to stock up on more aloe vera, new sunscreen and a hat. bloody hell.

      finally a decent weekend ahead for me, i think.  leaving in just about 2 hours to head home with hendrik. it's our 5 year high school anniversary tomorrow, and while i am still not too excited about seeing most of the folks i graduated with, i  *am*  excited about seeing the girls's from the clique we had back in middle school. jane now 7 months pregnant, martina freshly out of the closet, sandra as good as married, filiz brilliant at doing med, tati working as a nurse.... wonder how cindy is, and biene, too. then there's simon, who i really want to see, and boris, and about a handful of others.  seeing the rest (just the other hundred or so), i couldn't care much less about. i remember the best feeling in school was not having to like them anymore, on the day we graduated. wonder what they'll think about me, whether most will still hate me, whether most will think i'm fat. wonder how i'll get through the night without feeling like a failure or sounding too arrogant, and guess i'll follow dr.k's advice and listen mostly, which is a difficult thing for me, the always talking one. but it'll be good, eventually, i think. not going would be cowardish. it's just a few hours, and if i really hate it, i can always leave, can't i? am still pondering whether i should organise for someone to drive me, or stay sober all night: the latter might actually prove to be even more entertaining than if i got drunk. he.  no matter what, it'll be fine.  will head back here late saturday: grant, evan's father, will be in geneva on a business trip, and sunday is the only day he's truly got off before the conference he'll attend kicks off.  so i'll hop on a train to  urlLink geneva  bright and early on 6am and spend the day there with grant, before i return in the late evening. nothing like a trip to switzerland to break the routine of boring weekends. never been to geneva before and am truly excited: the weather will most likely absolutely rock this weekend (31°C predicted for sunday), there's a huge boat race on at the lac, and it'll be a good day spent outside, with good food and drinks and nice conversation with grant, who's as fabulous a soon-to-be-father-in-law as one can wish for.  so don't expect to hear much from me. i'm out there having a life for a change. :)

       a couple of weeks ago i saw  urlLink christian bauer's  documentary  urlLink "missing allen - the man who became a camera"  and was absolutely captivated by it.  christian bauer's longtime friend and colleague allen ross, a filmmaker from chicago, dissapears without a trace not long after finishing filming a docu with bauer. 4 years later, bauer and other friends of allen's go on a search for him, taking cameras with them, trying to uncover what has happened to him, whether he's chosen to start a new life - which he had previously mentioned- or whether something else has happened. plainly speaking: whether allen has been killed.  with them, you visit places where allen has lived. you get to know allen's father, looking through allen's mail hoping to uncover anything. you are with them as they find some of his most precious belongings, including his camera, stored in a garage. you are with them as they find his beloved car. with them as they search a garbage dump after hearing claims he was buried there.  the story they finally uncover is frightening and  bizarre. so bizarre that it would be unbelievable if this were a fictional movie.  but life writes the strangest stories of all.  this docu is extremely personal. the flimmakers let you get so close to themselves, to allen, to his friends, to his father. so close it hurts. so close that by the end of it, you the viewer, too, miss allen and are sad about his loss. you feel the pain they feel, feel their need to escape from what has  happened to allen. their sadness and need to escape is most obvious when bauer interviews a fellow photographer & friend of allen's on a rooftop. asking him whether he misses allen. and the photographer, camera in hand, visibly shaken and close to tears, keeps lifting up his camera, taking photos of the camera filming him, instead of replying.  bauer just says:  "i, too, hide behind the camera."   sadness transcends the screen. just like the love and admiration his friends felt for him. i've never seen a greater tribute to an artist and friend before.  i wonder what allen would have said if he saw it.   for more:  urlLink chicago sun times: the case of the missing filmmaker    urlLink faz: tutorial on the art of tracking people down    urlLink Chicago reader: The Allen Ross Mystery: A Body in the Basement    urlLink chicago reader: letter to the editor

      my mother asked me this weekend what i wanted for my birthday.  and i couldn't come up with any urgent wishes at all. got my flight to australia, so what else do i need? sure, 24.000 AUS$ would be nice for my studies there, but well, a bit much to ask for a birthday. sure, there are some books and cds i'd like, and some computer stuff, too. but nothing that isn't too big a present that i really urgently want. there's not much point in wanting fluff for my flat (which i usually love) when i need to ship it all to the other side of the world soon. i need every day things though, mainly clothing. some work clothes, a decent not too thick coat, some sexy shoes, a little black dress and an evening gown, too. i need some workout clothes, specifically pants and a decent sports top. i want some underwear from agent provocateur which i'll get as a pressie for myself when i'm in london next month. but that's really it.  strangely enough, i already know two pressies that i'll get for my birthday... when packing up things in my brothers flat a few months back, i stumbled across an envelope that contained the edition of  urlLink bravo  that was out in the week i was born. very cute. yesterday, evan slipped when i told him i had made a mistake and wasn't arriving by 5:55am but at 5:55pm on July the 24th, thinking that would be something he'd be delighted to hear about as it would mean much less hassle for him. alas, he got a bit stressed, telling me we had plans for that night. and now i think i know  urlLink what these plans are . wooohoooo. 2 years ago, the concert rocked. it was honestly the best concert i've ever been to (u2 aside, but that's because of u2, not the way they play); the boys from gomez have so much fun on stage, and it was a pleasure to see them having so much fun. and the music... aww. while the concert was fine, i remember being sad that night, crying during alex lloyd's (who was warm up then)  "my way home"  and that i had spend much of the previous night crying because i was so unhappy with life, and our relationship, and freshly off tricyclics.  no drama right before the concert this time, if the sia pilots are super punctual that is, and if i'll manage to fight my way through immigrations...last time, it took me just about 20 minutes to get out with my luggage and all. please cross your fingers.  so it's going to be my birthday in less than two weeks, and i'm as unexcited as never before. i have no thing planned for the day. no party. not even a get-together. it'd be so fake to call around now to get together with people i haven't seen in months, just because it's my birthday. too bad fritz is gone, his party on my birthday last year rocked and was the perfect way to celebrate. but nothing this year. no way to escape either, as fabian won't be in london. would have been perfect to get away.  so i guess i'll spend the day the way i'd spend every sunday in june: workout in the morn, spend a few hours on the phone with evan, study, sit in the sun, make a nice dinner for me. even tina will most likely be out of town. if she's here, we might go for an inline skating class the day before and go out for a few cocktails that night. but if she's not here, why go out alone?  problem is, that i can't blame anybody but me for the fact that no one's here to celebrate with. i left everyone. so how could i expect them to be around when i would finally like some company?  i wish i could fly out a month early and be on the plane on my birthday. flying with the time, it'd be over 8 hours sooner.

      I'm in a bit of a sappy mood today. Blame the  urlLink InStyle: Wedding Special . It's only the tip of the iceberg though: Weddings, dresses, proposals are jumping at me everywhere i turn. I'm turning into one of these women who ponder what kind of train she wants on her dress. Quite ridiculous. After all, this shall one day be about love, not clothing. But I'm still tempted to try on the very simple sleek dress i've seen in a shop nearby last thursday....

      i had to make a sad decision this weekend, regarding the  urlLink tour de france  trip with my dad.  it's cancellend. i had confused the date for the stage up mont ventoux, had wrongly remembered that the tour would arrive there on the saturday before i fly out. alas, the tour arrives there late sunday, which is quite simply too late. there is no way i'd feel comfy planning on leaving the south of france on sunday, most likely very late in the evening,  exhausted after a day of standing on a shadeless mountain if i have to be at frankfurt airport a good 48 hours later, with packed bags. no way of being able to predict whether we'd actually be able to get down mont ventoux on the same day that the stage ends there in the first place. oh the logistics of the tour.  what a bummer. i so wanted to be on mont ventoux and also see the mountain stage up les deux alpes, especially with my dad. it's been so good these past two years to have this father-daughter trip with him. i had sacrificed the les deux alpes stage when i booked my flight, because i knew that was in the beggining of the week, thinking we could still manage mont ventoux. but i was wrong. ack.  however, after taking another good look at the tour parcours and my diary, it doesn't look like it's going to be a tourless year for me after all. i'll be up north looking after my parents bookshop from the 1st to the 10th (while they are be holidaying -yet again- in italy), which would make it absolutely *perfect* to head to luxembourg for a day to watch the tour there. woohoo!  the tour will be in luxembourg from the 6th to the 8th, it's  urlLink le grand départ du luxembourg  this year, three days of tour extravaganza in a row.  it'll be a good 300km trip one way from my parents place, so right now, i think i'll head there for the  urlLink prologue  on saturday the 6th. the tours timing is good, i can leave early, take a good look around luxembourg, watcht the tour and head home, - and rest the next day and recover, too.   urlLink   i'm well aware that the prologue itself won't be anything too exciting - just the usual flat roughly 7km  ride through town - but it'd be an almost 6 hour show ( urlLink caravane at 13:30, last rider at 19:17 ). plus i'd get to see all of riders  seperately and hence would get to cheer  urlLink lance  directly. that really is such an important factor: nothing quite like the giant crowds on the roads cheering the favourites.   i remember the time trial here in hometown in 2000 very fondly; what a rocking day that was, and the amazing atmosphere when jan ullrich as first and runner up were the last to hit the road that day. so i hope a prologue would be similarly entertaining.  woohoo! tour de france, here i come. now more preparations: where can i get clothing with the star of texas and an american flag? ;)

      i've seen alex a lot recently.  not in real life, mind you. he's been on tv a lot, in a variety of typical little tueday & wednesday night tv-movies. usually as the "other man", the tempting karate instructor who puts a strain on a couple's relationship, when wildly screwing the wife on the wooden floor of a gym room (tastefully lit and nicely shot, with nice views of his butt), or as the slightly seedy flirt class instructor.  it's been years since our encounter at "sam's", the now long gone bar where steffi, ilka and i hung out on sunday nights. 9 years...  back then, we spend sunday nights at "sam's" when there was no school on monday, so that we could go out late, sleep over at ilka's and be woken up by the kids her mom looked after. those fabulous nights at sam were eagerly anticipated and prepared. we spend the afternoons trying to make-up us old enough & choosing clothing we'd change into in hotel toilets or the back of steffi's car. sometimes we'd head out to the theatre in the early evening and try to get into the show for free or rip off bus drivers with left over group tickets. more often, we'd hang out at the stage door to see who was working that night and would later go to pizza hut, share a pizza and wait for time to pass. alternatively, we'd go to UCI and watch movies in english.   at 11, we'd go to "sam's", search out a strategic table or spot at the bar, buy drinks we were too young to buy and throw money into the video juke box to see take that's  "pray" , gloria gaynor's  "i am what i am"  or  "more than words"  by extreme just one more time.  by midnight, everyone would start arriving, and steffi, ilka and i would ogle and chat with ken, darren and paul (and stare at robbie williams rolling around in the sand in that video), wonder about who was dating or at least screwing who (i'll never forget the tragic night ken came to our table and introduced darren's boyfriend who had flown in frm the uk, oh how did i suffer!) and try to be part of the in-crowd. it felt great. it like what we were supposed to be doing at that time in our lives.  then one night in early spring, after a couple of weeks not hanging out at "sam's", alex was there.  i noticed him pretty early in the evening, he arrived before the people who had worked that night, with a group of show newbies i had already seen, show newbies just like he was one. he caught my eye straight away and i couldn't take my eyes of him, he had what i looked for back then: slightly longer hair, a pretty butt and a certain look in his eyes. he wasn't attractive in the typical sense of the word, he wasn't a smooth faced pretty boy, but he had that certain something: he looked wild. he oozed sexiness. when i went to the bar to buy some drinks for ilka, steffi and me, he chatted me up. i brought the ordered drinks to our table, and spend the rest of the evening at the bar with him, flirting like mad.  he was still in prep camp for the show then, the new casts premiere was several weeks away, and he told me about his job and asked me whether i had ever seen the show. trying so hard to be part of the in-crowd and wanting to avoid standing out as "a fan", i denied it, and so he spend some time telling me things i already new and had known for ages. it was funky (but the dumbest thing to do, in retrospect), sexy, enjoyable. his voice near my ear tickled a spot next to my spine and his hand on my back or shoulder or arm made me shiver. more drinks were had, and we moved to other topics and it was a bloody good enjoyable flirt, even though i committed another white lie by doing the required thing (at least past midnight in a bar, while consuming hard liquor) by lying about my age.  oh, the sweet insanity of your teens. :)  unfortunately, that very same night, my little white lies collapsed, at least the most important one, the one about me being part of the in-crowd.  alex and i were still flirting, sitting close together at the bar, when melanie, a fellow wanna-be-in-crowd-member, suddenly disrupted us. i had never liked her, and she had never liked me, and as clever as she was, she had realised her chance to ruin my night. the conversation she stroke up started innocently enough, asking alex how training was going, but when he indicated he'd prefer to continue talking with me instead of her, she turned to me and asked something really ridicluous, i can't even remember what, but her question instantly showed alex that i knew her, knew the show, knew everyone else, and was at the bar to do just what i was doing with him there. oh, and it showed that i had not been honest to him.  ouch.  i bet melanie was quite happy about being able to so efficently ruin my  evening. and my chances with alex. i can't remember how our flirt ended. i assume steffi, ilka and i fled because i was so embarrassed by my lies collapsing. at 14, i was brave enough to spend my nights at bars chatting up terribly attractive dancers, but not quick and sarcastic enough to not let someone like melanie ruin my flirts with those dancers.  i ended up seeing alex at sam's a couple of more times, but never managed more than a hello. i saw him perform one time that following summer, too, and wondered, while seeing him on stage, how things might have developed had melanie not ruined my night, had i not uttered that first lie.  moot thoughts. when i stopped hanging out at the theatre, and at sam's, when i deemed "trying to be part of the in-crowd" a waste of time, i lost touch with everyone.  one day in 1998, i had already moved down south, 5 years after the nights at "sam's", i saw alex in a local magazine. he had just done his first movie, which was going to premier in my town the next night, with the director and actors and an open after-movie party. unfortunately, i was leaving town the next day and couldn't change my plans.  and now alex is on tv, and reasonably successful, too. every time i recognize him (or his butt in tasteful sex scenes), it makes me happy for him.  i sometimes wonder whether he'd remember me if we met now, whether he'd remember what it was like that one night when he was fresh from stage school and i was 14 and the little flirt who made a quick exit when her lies were uncovered.  if i met you now, alex, i'd spare you a couple of drinks, wish you more roles, better roles, real cinema, and that your  urlLink bio at imdb.com  will one day contain a pic of yourself. and of your pretty butt, too.

       urlLink i hate marmite.   urlLink i love marmite.   i personally love it. can't say that aloud though when evan is around. so un-aussie to love marmite in his opinion (and mine, actually, too, but hey, there's a little bit of kiwi in me. like when i say "six" or "fish and chips"). but then i love vegemite, too. however, i was initiated into the world of yeast concentrate spreads in christchurch, on a late afternoon, on toast, with margarine. so how could i deny that?  i didn't like it at first though. like my friend tic once so eloquently explained, years ago:    "having vegemite (or marmite) for the first time is like sex for the first time. you don't really like it. and wonder what all the fuss is about. but the more you try it, the better it gets. and after a while, you just don't want to miss it anymore."    while i didn't mind intercourse that much on first try (thanks, frank!), i can't say i loved marmite's first time. but i do like it now. yum.  (link via  urlLink nonharmful . thanks roel.)

      i'm exhausted and tired. both physically and mentally.  just came back from the gym and it was disastrous. during the entire bodystyling class, i could not focus at all. my thoughts were running wild, my blood pressure was so low that i kept seeing blinking black and white stars, my blood sugar was so low that i couldn't even do crunches by the end of the class and i was terribly irritated. weird people in the class: everyone was ultra skinny, and the biazarre woman who always does everything differently (and always uses weights) stood right next to me, which made me go insane. i could not bear to exercise next to her. it felt like each kick of her skinny little legs (with the extra heavy weights) was a kick into my self-esteem.  i feel terrible for being so judgemental about that woman. women should just not judge each other based on their bodies. that woman did nothing that would justify my anger towards her. but i'm angry, because i envy her. i envy her tiny kylie minogue like figure. i envy her flexibility. i envy her stamina. i envy the fact that because she is so skinny her range of movement is so much larger than mine. sometimes i still believe that i'd be happier/more popular/what have you were i skinnier. i should know better: i was just as unhappy when i was skinnier.  no matter how hard i tried this afternoon, i could not stop comparing myself, could not get out of my competetive mindset. instead of looking at the progress i've made (like today being able to last throughout the horrible lunges, like the good feeling in my thighs), i kept staring at the other women in the class, and felt horrible: fat, jiggly, unfit, what have you. as a result, i felt terrible when the class was over. even though i was completely exhausted, i didn't have the usual  "after-work-out-high"  and felt dissatisfied, like i could have done more.  i'll now go worship my body in an effort to reconnect and make peace with it. will spend the evening with an extensive manicure, pedicure, facial and a self-tanning session. maybe that'll help. - and prevent a similar nightmare at tomorrows bodystyling class.  mantra for tonight:  i feel good in my body. it is the vessel that carries my soul.

Mah frend sayz yea.  Inspired by Gummy, we came to the conclucion, that the language & grammar in Ask A Sexpert are the result of an unholy get together of James Joyce, Judy Blume and e.e.cummings.   he. :)

      since monday, when i got the job offer from my new law firm (need to come up with a nice cover name for them), i have not received any further eMails of any kind from any of the 15 law firms that still haven't replied to my applications.  bizarrely enough, it was exactly the same two years ago: as soon as i got and had accepted the offer from the old firm  as if the other firms knew , no one else contacted me. no rejections. no offers. just nothing in my mailbox regarding my job application.  and now it's just like that again. no further rejections. no further offers. nothing. simply nothing. that fact makes me realise that it was the right decision to accept the job offer from the new firm straight out, -  i had initally planned to wait for a few days before accepting, just in case  something better came along . alas that didn't happen, and i doubt that it will.  this absolute silence from the left-over firms makes me wonder whether they aren't seperate firms but one congolmerate of firms instead, all run by the devil in al pacino's body, sitting in his office on the top floor of the rialto, looking down on melbourne and tempting young lawyers to sell their souls. think  urlLink the devil's advocate . or whether that conglomerate is run by a group of humans instead, who've fallen prey to the temptations of an assortment of demons. think  urlLink wolfram & hart .  as long as i'd get keanu as the devil's son or angel to my rescue, i wouldn't mind either that much, actually.  he.

       it's like someone flipped a switch inside my head.  it's gone, that unnaturally good mood i've been in since monday. instead my companions for the night are the usual well known self-hate & self-doubt. oh, and the worries are here, too. nice to see you all. i'm sick to my stomach, it hit me just as i was preparing dinner: i had to stop cooking right in the middle of it because i knew i couldn't get one bite down. i'm sitting paralysed in front of work that's due on monday, staring at it like a deer into the headlights. knowing that i blew it yet again. knowing i can't blame anybody but me. i am the faulty thing here.  i want this to stop. i want to function.  writing this, feeling this, shows that today's soul cleaning session missed its point just a wee bit. i only scratched the surfaces and still smiled and acted nice. that hurt more than it helped.  last time chemicals helped. and now i wonder: is that the only path that will lead somewhere/anywhere?

      everyone seems to be leaving this city. i feel cheated.  i always wanted to leave people behind, and be the one moving on. i never wanted to be left behind. but just that is happening.   fritz, my dear over the courtyard neighbour has finally moved away completely. from my desk i can see the painters still working in his kitchen. now there won't be any late night calls anymore, calls for no reasons at all, just because he saw my lights on at 3am, on return from a party. no more nights out drinking till 5am. no more looking after each others flats. no more summer parties like the one we had last year, on my birthday. today's heavy rain reminded me of the first evening fritz and i went out, after a couple of weeks of smiling and waving from window to window. we had a couple of beers in the downstairs cafe, and it rained heavily, like today. i remembered the night we had some wine on my balcony, when i tricked him into showing me the tatoo ello and i had spotten from afar weeks before when lying on my balcony, while he was walking around his place half dressed.  then there are all the people who i started uni with, who i'm not in touch with anymore. all the superficial friendships that marked my first 2 years here. i miss them in a strange way, not the meaninglessness, but the strange ease these friendships had.  and now tina is moving away. to start anew and escape the german med testing system, she'll relocate to graz, austria.  in my head, i know this decision is right for her. she needs the fresh start, the new chance. but still. it makes me sad to see her go. it will be a lot less funny, a lot lonelier, just a lot different without her. my best friend is moving away, and it feels terrible. we would have gone through a change in our friendship soon anyway. i'll be leaving soon, and move away a lot further then just graz. but still.  i can't remember the exact first time we met. it must have been in the hallway or the elevator of the house we both lived in. we had both just started uni, i was sharing a flat with the flatmate from hell, she was living alone, next door. somehow, our chats in the hallway got longer. by our second semester, i had been invited to her birthday get-together. i remember how bad it went when i invited her to mine, she was sitting in a corner of my balcony, being bombarded by question from obscure friends of mine. somehow, from that second semester on, despite little desasters, we got really close. we started cooking a lot together, and tina dropped by almost every night, for talks about her day in the dissecting room over big bowls of rice pudding. i communicated more with her than with the flatmate from hell. when i got addicted to working out, she joined, too, and soon we'd have months of frantic joined gym going and months of joined laziness.  soon after i had escaped the flat from hell, she moved out of that house, too, and while that meant the end to our late night eating sessions, our friendship grew. countless shopping sessions, cups of peppermint tea and whine and bitch sessions both at home, the gym or over the phone did the trick. tina always listened to me, and i listened to her. i've held pillows so that she could kick them. i set her up with a friend of evs. she organised the tv show for evan and me.  she held my hand when i got my bellybutton pierced. we had a fab time and perfect new years in amsterdam kast year. we laugh when we both fail miserably at choreography during aerobics classes. we are both easily affected by advertisements and love shopping at dm together. we both do therapy, try to free ourselves from our parents and manage our degrees. while we have not shared every little detail with each other, we both know that we could, if we needed to.  and now she's moving away.   urlLink it's 47 days  until i fly off to australia. and hence it's 47 days left that we'll be living in the same city. she'll be moving when i am away, so i can't even help packing, be at her goodbye party or wave goodbye. 47 days really isn't a lot. 47 days ago was april 20th. i can't remember just what i did that day, nothing written in my journal that day, but that week was anzac day, and i anxiously awaited the results from the fotie and made anzac biscuits. my brother moved to london that weekend. tina and i won't get much of a chance to spend time together these coming 47 days. our weekends are almost all full: there's my upcoming 5 year high school reunion and a visit to or by evan's dad. then it's my birthday on which tina will be away, then i'll be home to housesit yet again, then i'll be in london visiting my brother, then tina has exams, two weeks later i'll be at the tour de france, and three days later, i'll be on a plane. and that's that. it's scary. while i really can not wait for july 23rd to arrive because i can not wait to leave and see my boy, the fact that a phase of tina and my friendship is ending and that we can't even celebrate it because so much is already planned sucks muchly.  i try to remind myself that change is normal. change is good. this big change for her is for the better. our friendship is good and strong and will survive this, just as it will survive my upcoming move to australia.  but still.  i'll miss her. terribly. every day. i hate feeling left behind.

      after my session with dr.k today, i walked right into a wild summer thunderstorm. it had started while we were closing the session. lighting and thunder interuppted my rants. as i walked out of his door, my clothes were dripping wet within less than 30 seconds. - it was like someone had out a bucket of water directly over my head. - like that one time when i stood in front row of a fury concert, wearing a white t-shirt. call it the involuntary wet t-shirt contest experience. as it didn't matter anymore anyway, i walked home slowly, and enjoyed the rain.  it sounds very cliché, but heavy rain and thunder and lightning in summer, even in the middle of the day, do something to me. they alert my senses and make my libido go wild. the rain was surprisingly warm, and fell heavily. water was gurgling down the walkways and into the little canals that are all over this city. i felt water drip through my hair and down my face, caressing me in unexpected ways. walking through town, walking through the rain, pretty much alone on the usually busy city center cobblestone roads, i felt a sudden urge to take off my clothes and feel the rain not only on my face and arms, but all over me.  too bad i'm not that daring. or as manic as i sometimes feel.

      anticipating rejection doesn't help that much when it finally arrives.  i did get a rejection letter from "my" law firm last monday, which literally blew me off my feet and turned me into a self-injuring, crying little piece of nothing. the reason they gave for my rejection was quite obviously a blatant lie. insert a 48 hour self-bashing phase here.  during that phase i somehow managed to drag myself to the computer, open ie and search out and apply to every single law firm in melbourne that  urlLink google ,  urlLink cvmail  and lawyer directories turned up.  a week and 15 rejections later, i was offered -and today accepted- a position with a specialist ip firm that looks small enough to have decent work (no slavery!) but big enough to have interesting clients (fun!). from what i know so far, they have absolutely fantastic clients. big big international companies, big big media names. yihaa.  when i first looked at the firm's website, I had this odd feeling that they might accept me. that vibe made me wonder for a minute whether i wanted to apply in the first place, made me wonder whether this wasn't too small a firm. but i did apply, and it turns out they sound just perfect.  all is a whole lot better today than it was this time last week. the prospect of sitting around for 2 months, albeit in melbourne, doing nothing but wasting time (for lack of money to travel, and lack of desire to be away from ev) was so horrific that it made me panic. it would have been terribly for our relationship had i sat around all day, waiting for him to come home. but now it's going to be ok: i'll be working, and hopefully earning money. i'll be busy, commute every morn the short way downtown, get to wear my work suits, meet pals during my lunch break and sit in the sun having coffee. i'll come home when everyone else comes home, cook dinner and end the day with talks over tea with ev. it'll all be good. it's predictable again, but still exciting. terribly exciting. just 48 days to go.  in other good news, evan's ex appears to be having a partner again, for the first time since he broke up with her because of me, in december 1999. i wished for her to find love again ever since, and strangely enough the feeling of happiness i feel now is much less relief about not having to worry about her insanity any longer (for some strange reason, sometime this past weekend i figured out that if he wanted to be with her, he wouldn't be with me. sounds simple, took years.), but indeed real happiness for her, even though i don't know her, even though she surely made my life difficult at times (or rather: because ev let her make his life difficult, our life difficult.). ev suggested that if things stay as good as they are (i.e. her being sane), we might even go on a double date with her and her new chap one fine day. i had that idea that very same second, too, but must admit that for the moment, seeing a photo of her -which i still haven't- would be more than enough for a start. no reason to hurry: took her more than two years to start not being totally irrational, so i reckon i can take some time to figure out whether i want to meet her in the first place, too.  so it's all better. i might even get through my 5 year high school reunion, which is coming up next weekend. i still am not too sure whether going is the right thing to do, but i really do not want to miss out on meeting my now newly out friend martina and her partner, seeing my dear friend jane being 7 months pregnant, and meeting simon, who is apparently still suffering because i turned him down when he stood at my doorstep the morning after a wild drunken make out session during one of our graduation parties. i want to see some people again, but i really do not want to see the majority of my class. it'll most likely be a stressful night. trying to cover up my failures, trying to still be real and not too fake. i am already pondering as to what i should wear, it really is pretty childish and dumb. i should either not go, or be relaxed and go. but not be as worried as i currently am.  session with dr.k tomorrow. that should help me bring some sense to it all.

      i'm happy, and nervous, and excited.  my suitcase is closed (blessed be the manufacturers of samsonite suitcases, for making such spacious suitcases), everything is organised, all i got to do is change into my travel clothes, close the windows and my balcony door, and call a cab to the train station. i still have this surreal feeling: it all has been going so well these past days that i still fear that something terrible *has* to happen to ruin it all.  yesterday -like sunday- was just perfect. worked out in the morning, met tina around noon and spend the rest of the day with her. it was lovely, our last day as galpals living in the same country. shopped for some more pressies (and found perfect stuff for evan's siblings) and went to the laundromat, where i did my laundry and where we partied a wee bit with dieter and marco (who let me do my washing for free, quite amazing), having champagne and fabulous real italian espresso and talking. will be strange to go there without tina. it won't quite be the same.  finished the day with girly talk on the balcony and doing pedicures, and when we said goodbye, and hugged and kissed and she left, i started to feel what it will be like without her. this will be a different city. this will be a different life. her characteristic ringing at my door (3 short sharp rings) won't let me know it's her and make me open the door even if i didn't feel like seeing anyone. we won't be lying on the floor in bodystyling class anymore, laughing about the ridiculous excercises. we won't be finishing each others sentences every day, and understand each other with nothing but a sideways glance. i'll miss her, but understand why she's leaving and wish her nothing but the best for her re-start in austria.  however, i really don't want to be gloomy. i'll be seeing evan in little more than 30 hours. i'll be on my way in little more than an hour. it's breathtakingly exciting.  last night, i hardly slept: woke up at 3am, tried to sleep until 5am, until i decided that it wasn't going to work anyway, so i got up instead and started cleaning my kitchen and bathroom instead. that lack of sleep should help squash any flight induced insomnia. this morning, i was literally shaking with excitement and nervousness, but that has thankfully faded.  i should be a pro. i should take this plane trip halfway round the world as easily as i take the train to go home; because my real home is where evan is, after all. but i just can't take it as easy: this is such a big thing, that i can't pretend i'm not as excited as i am. and good grace. am i excited.  maybe more from singapore. otherwise: see you from melbourne.  :)

      i bought a  urlLink cuckoo clock  today.  while this was -most likely- my first and last ever cuckoo clock purchase (i can't imagine ever having an interior design in a place where i live that could incorporate a classic cuckoo clock), it sure was fun. caught a train to  urlLink titisee , the nearby tourist spot, which is the only city i know that has a shopping district, lined *only* with cuckoo clock & souvenir shops. next to heidelberg, roteburg ob der tauber and the hofbräuhaus, titisee is a must on every  europe-in-7-days  bustour, the kind that american senior citizens love to do in summer, on which everyone seems to sport a uniform of khaki shorts, t-shirts & caps honoring their homestates & sneakers - and name tags at all times.  so i entered the biggest and bestest and most renowned cuckoo clock store on titisee's cuckoo clock shop street (actually, the big store owns most of the small stores anyway, so it's fake fake fake, and all cuckoo clocks in town are created equal and cost the same), approached a salesman and announced my desire to purchase one, which sparked him to quick start his memorised  cuckoo clock styles & technical differences  speech (along the lines of  urlLink this ), which was so enthusiastic that i had to stop him, tell him i already knew what kind of style i wanted (plain old traditional nutwood cuckoo clock with traditional "cuckoo parents & little cuckoo" carvings on the front, with a "cuckoo off" switch - you don't want the cuckoo to cuckoo althrough the night right?). the exact same guy had delived the exact same speech to me back in january, when on a little trip with evan, santa and john. he. the only decision which i needed help regarded the clockwork automatic: a one week one -which means you just have to rewind it once a week- would sure have been nice, but was both not affordable (40 more than a one day one), and would also have been way too heavy to carry home (those one week weights alone would have weighed in at 9 pounds), so i decided on a nice, plain, traditional one day automatic, made in germany. i hope it *is* as close to a traditional clock as i was assured it is.  when i handed over my debit card, allowing the shop to deduct 78 from my stressed out account, a pang of worry struck me ( will this really be something evan's family will like? after all, his mother always said that she wanted one! ). it must have been quite obvious, as i got a reassuring chat from the salesman ( "australians love these" . now that wasn't a generalisation, was it?) with my well packed cuckoo clock, after a thorough instruction on how to set it up once i've handluggaged it to australia (there's a variety of preventative measurements in place to prevent the clock from cuckooing when being transported, and lots of styrofoam, too). should anything ever go wrong, within two years, there'll be free repairs at a clock shop in hawthorn, melbourne, victoria. shocking. that cuckoo clock shop has affiliate clock repairs all over the globe, literally, including at least one in every us state. that's true customers service, eh?  i proudly carried my cuckoo clock through the cuckoo clock & souvenir shop street. noticed people -old americans in the aforementioned uniform- ogling my not exactly camouflage yellow bag saying  "uhren brunner titisee"  in huge bold arial in the hands of me, the almost hip young lady. on the train, i sat the clock on its own seat, and held tight to it, althrough the ride, worried about it sliding odd the seat,  and now there's a cuckoo clock, still disassembled, in a dreamless sleep awaiting being brought to life in a living room 16.409 km away, in its little cardboard and styrofoam box, sitting in my room, the box still in the super sturdy yellow plastic bag .  this is so kitschy a present (even in this very traditional, harmless form), i would have never shelled out that much money (and pardon me, this was one of the cheapest clocks around. i saw a us couple spend 300 on one today) for a present so very german, had i not been assured that this will actually be some sort of a wish come true for evan's mom. if that *is* the case, she should like this. it is as pretty as a cuckoo clock can be, i think. it's even "tasteful"!  i am so worried about this. i so hope she and the rest of the family will like it.  otherwise, at every cuckoo intervall, every 30  minutes, they'll be annoyed. and be reminded of the horrible person who brought that torturous clock into their house. me. oy.  wouldn't make for a good start to my possible role as daughter in law, would it?

       urlLink friday five    1. Where were you born?  dinslaken, germany.   2. If you still live there, where would you rather move to? If you don't live there, do you want to move back? Why or why not?  i don't live there any more, but my parents do. and the fact it's just too small, too ugly, and too slow (and simply not melbourne, australia) make me never want to live there for a longer stretch of time ever again,   3. Where in the world do you feel the safest?  i feel safe pretty much everywhere. this is europe. it *is* safe. the one place i would pick where i feel safest actually, is with evan. in bed. the place where i used to go for summer camps in the summers of my teens -an old 800 year old castle- runs in as a close second.   4. Do you feel you are well-traveled?  more or less. i've been to many places, and on many continents. but i haven't stayed at many different destinations though, overall. while i like travelling and discovering new places, i prefer returning to a place i liked the first time around. i sure need to see the us and south america and asia, and get to know many places here in europe more in depth.   5. Where is the most interesting place you've been?  i've been to many places that were interesting on many different levels. the nz westcoast was most interesting wildlife like. london is most interesting museum wise. amsterdam is most interesting location wise. berlin is most interesting politics wise. paris is most interesting french wise. melbourne is most interesting vibe & atmo wise. picking one would mean disregarding many.

       4 days in london  = retail therapy at  urlLink lush  ( urlLink butterballs ,  urlLink creamed almond and coconut smoothie ,  urlLink buffy the backside slayer  and  urlLink sympathy for the skin ); ogling  urlLink diana's  gowns and various queen's wedding dresses at  urlLink kensington palace  (and chatting with a diana-crazed canadian lady, hilarious!), having my first ever  evil-corporate-america-rules-the-globe   urlLink frappucino ; a fine curry with my brother and his aussie colleague peter at  urlLink preem  in brick lane; cheapo shopping at  urlLink muji ; hours at the  urlLink tate modern , spend standing in amazement, with shivers down my spine, lumps in my throat and tears in my eyes, in the room with  urlLink mark   urlLink rothkos   urlLink seagram murals ; laughing with my brother about annoying teenaged us tourists (why in all the world do americans always feel the urge to  talk ?) while walking along portobello road; waking up at 5am in the lounge because of all the light, putting up the shades and sleepily watching planes fly in over london's skyline; in the  longing for 250 &pounds to splurge on a corset at  urlLink agent provocateur  (the place with the hottest lingerie selling women on earth, all with marilyn monroe sex appeal. va-va-voom!) ;  urlLink becky anderson  and a still unidentified colleague of hers at the  urlLink great eastern ; sitting in the sun & watching a fabulous young street performer at covent garden;  urlLink a guided walk  through east london in the footsteps of jack the ripper (resulting in freaked out waking up in the middle of the night, despite having two phones and a knife right next to the bed); the tube, which has never been the same since reading neil gaiman's neverwhere; a drunken night with my brother, his boss and colleagues at their  urlLink local   urlLink corney & barrow  (absolutely no atmo whatsoever, that place. ugh.); having a  urlLink mangoes & passionfruit   urlLink innocent   urlLink smoothie  on my brothers balcony, in the sun, with a view of tower bridge.... and so much more.  i had a lovely time, indeed.

      Back from London. Now at home with the parents until tomorrow. Busy at the shop. Busy getting my clothes clean, ironed and in order. Busy with more shopping. Am reading "The Power of NOW" which is an eye-opener, and better than any book of this kind that I've ever read.  A week to go until I leave. A week until I see my boy.  Shocking.

      am on high shopping alert today.  lot of fun, actually. started last night with almost 2 hours at waterstones, picking out books from their 3 for 2 special (got "atonement" by ian mcewan,  "all families are psychotic" by douglas coupland and "the power of now" by eckkart tolle) spend the morning ogling the queen's and princess di's dresses at kensington palace, and then decided that i urgently needed some clothes, too. found a gown that i am more than tempted to get. aw. black, flowing, fabulous. and just 40£, down from 160£. i should get it. brother will give a second opinion though tomorrow, it really is pretty outragous and wild. also tried on corsets today. which is a pain, when you don't have a friend in the fitting room to help you, actually. tempted to buy one (actually not a full corset, got a special name, not that i know what that is, he)  and a fitting string, too. lovely light see through material, with pink embrodery. very girly, 50's pinup. aw.  so all is good today.  will be going on a jack the ripper walk while brother is out screwing his new affair girl. the walk starts practically at our front door, so when i'm home by 10, i'll simply cook a nice meal and jump in the tub, together with all the products i just bought from lush. yum. that's a kind of stay in night i don't mind, even if there's london night life burstling outside. tomorrow will be wilder: going out with my brother and his really nice aussie colleague peter. should be fun, too.  so it isn't that bad, this city thing. still a wee bit lonely. but it's nice, nonetheless.

      it's been fun so far, this city thing. a wee bit lonely though, too.  been walking around lots, got way too drunk with my brothers colleagues and boss last night, been to the the tate modern twice already (nearly started crying upon walking into the mark rothko room yesterday afternoon, so intense was the physical sensation, quite strange), sat in the sun today and have -overall- had a good time so far, despite lots of strangeness on my brother's part. he is having an affair which isn't  surprising and/or upsetting, but what is surprising and/or upsetting is that he'll be spening fridaynight with her, which will in turn mean that i have to cover for him in case his girlfriend calls. and even worse that i'll be sitting alone at home in london on a fridaynight. going out alone? can imagine better things, really.  miss having a companion to tour the town with me, to discuss what i see, to share discoveries. sounds pretentious. but i am a wee bit lonely. which sucks. anyway. time at towr records almost up. time to get to waterstone's and submerge myself in books i want.

      i'm almost in london.  today was hectic: shop stuff, blondification , shopping, packing, an hour long talk with my boy, more shop stuff, more shopping. am leaving bright and early tomorrow morning, my train to the airport runs at 7:14 am, my cheapo flight at 9:55. let's hope flight controllers are a bit more attentive over britain than over switzerland.  really looking forward to the trip. fabian called last night, gave me instructions - again - on how to get to his office, told me about his colleagues birthday bar thing we'll go to tomorrow at 5, the clubs we should head to on the weekend and gave me instructions that seem to confirm my suspicion that he's already having an affair over there. wouldn't be a new thing. hate knowing (because i do like his girlfriend over here, after all, and get along well with her), hate not knowing (because i do think having a good bro-sis relationship means knowing these kind of things). oh well. no matter what, it shall be fun to be in london, and get to know the way he lives these days. i hope my noveau riche brother will spoil his poor student sister a wee bit.  haven't made any definite plans yet, on how i'll spend my days. will probably just wander around (if the weather is not as bad as i fear it will be), go to the  urlLink tate  and see the freud exhibition, ogle corsets at  urlLink agent provocateur  (the boy asked me, when i told him about my recent shopping sprees, whether i had bought lingerie, too, which i actually haven't. not that he really wanted to talk about underwear, you know, he really doesn't care much about underwear, strange boy that he is, he just wanted to start talking about taking off any underwear i would be wearing. he.). will sure find some splendid ways to spend my time, me thinks.  off to have a life for a change. back after the weekend, at the latest.

      the past three nights have been full of strangely vivid dreams.  usually, i rarely remember my dreams. the only time in my life when i remembered them every morning was when i was on trycyclic anti-depressants, the dreams making up for all the other side-effects i experienced.  the last three nights were filled with dreams as vivid and real as the drug induced ones and all made me not want to wake up. it's strange and enjoyable and entertaining to dream this way, at least for me. it's fun while it lasts (most of the time), and in the morning, its interesting to try to make sense of what my subconcious has been telling me, even though i don't believe that dreams are hidden messages at all. saturday night, i dreamt of my friend timm, who i haven't seen in ages and lost touch with, a dream that i wanted to last longer, because it was so good to have him there. last night, i dreamt of a strange collective i was living in, bizarre people and rituals, a dream that was thrilling.  friday night, however, i dreamt of  urlLink jack  in a quite unexpected way.  i dreamt of jack and me having sex.  it was full blown detailed real dreaming, no conscious fantasizing here (which wouldn't be that startling, you know).  i've dreamt about people i only know online in the past (wouldn't confess to this, if i didn't know i wasn't the only one), but this kind of dream sure was a first, especially because i rarely have superbly explicit sex dreams to start with.  so the jack dream was strange on many levels: i knew it was him, just like you know these kinds of things when you're dreaming, and i heard his voice, which  gave me that strange feeling right next to my spine that i usually get when someone talk seductively into my ear. i do have a slight aural fixation, ever since thorsten, i think. despite that, i rarely dream very aurally, so that was a new thing, too. strange to dream about a voice i've only heard a tiny wee bit of in a .wav.  as much as the dream was arousing - we had intimate, wild, passionate sex-, as terrible did it feel "emotionally". while what happened in my dream felt pretty damn good (and good grace, please give me some safe sex award, i specifically dreamt of what condom & lube i chose from my safer sex tools drawer), i felt terribly guilty because of evan throughout the entire dream, a feeling that lasted well into my waking up. i suspect that that was actually the defining thing here. i have dreamt of sex with someone else since i've been with evan once before, and felt a similar guilt both within and after the dream back then, too.  wonder why this dream came up though. part of it is probably my re-awakening libido, making her reappearance just in time to make the last 2 weeks before i get to see evan unbearable. another part of it is probably my behaviour in past relationships, when i always broke rules and arrangements and went astray, most of the time without being fair about it. never before have i ever rested as happily and content in monogamy as i have for these past years, when i just have not had the desire to get into anyone's pants but evan's. maybe this is my subcinscious working through past behaviour. other possible catalysts are reading siri hustvedt's "the enchantment of lily dahl" (lily's relationship with ed has given me flashbacks about frank, must be the artist/age disparate relationship thing), and watching  urlLink intimacy  (which wasn't arousing per se, but the stark, very real sex scenes had "something" about them, that affected me). but anyway.  while a little sting of guilt is still there (even though i know it shouldn't be - this was beyond my control, after all, and i felt appropriatley guilty) it *was* very enjoyable, and memorable, and nice.  just too bad jack didn't dream this, too. felt the strange urge to tell him, but trying to put it into words feels almost too personal, too lose for comfort, the way dreams are sometimes too personal, sex fantasies can be too personal for someone else to hear, the way sex can be extremely personal, if you want it to be that way.  too bad he couldn't see what happened in his mind, too.

      like last year,  urlLink the austin-american statesman tour de france 2002 coverage  is a must in my online routine for the coming three weeks.   urlLink bill lyon: hope and hint of the impossible    "All those cancer patients out there, tethered to their chemotherapy drip poles, they watch him defeating mountains and storms, sprinting and climbing, riding holes through the wind, and he inspires in them a ferocity of will, rekindles and replenishes their spirit.  And, in turn, he feels them, he says. And they motivate him.  And vice versa."    sounds cheesy and pretentious, but isn't too far off. when watching the time trial in my hometown two years ago, a group of cancer patients was standing near us, being still excited and cheering for lance because they had a chance to meet lance the previous night, like their t-shirts showed. he really is an inspiration to many, just check out his  urlLink guestbook , which is full with testimonies on how his book "it's not about the bike" inspired other cancer victims. i know it influenced me, a healthy person, very much, too, and i remember buying it at melbourne airport, reading it on the imulse flight to sydney, reading it on alex's floor before falling asleep, and finishing it sitting on a rock in watson's bay, in the sun.   urlLink lance  rode exceptionally well on saturday, wearing yo-yo at the end of the prologue, which he and the team -understandibly- didn't defend yesterday. he'll wear it again, soon enough. just wait until the first mountains stage. my take is that he'll be wearing it continously from  urlLink la mongie  or  urlLink plateau-de-beille  to paris. :)

      it's the start of the tour today,  urlLink the prologue  in luxembourg, and i'm terribly annoyed about not being able to be there today. instead of standing by the side of the road in the rain, meeting funky people, catching funky merchandise from the caravane, enjoying the atmo, cheering lance and stuart and erik and everyone else, i'll let myself being yelled at by my grandma, and end up sitting in front of the telly alone as soon as tv coverage starts.  bummer.  am still excited though. i love the tour, the tactics, the cyclists, of this hardest sports event in the world, these three weeks of time trials, mountain stages, hors categorie mountains. i can't wait for the mont ventoux stage in two weeks. i can't wait for the time trials. i can't wait to see lance in  urlLink yo-yo .     it'll be a lot less exciting without  urlLink jan ullrich  there though, i think, and the doping news surrounding him right now don't exactly help the tour, either ( urlLink Cyclist Ullrich Faces Sack over Positive Dope Test )  first the dui crash after a night at kegan, knee problems (caused by wrong training, apparently) which made him announce he wouldn't be up for the tour, now amphetamines.  urlLink Cyclist Ullrich's Dr. Discusses Case :   "He has been going through a difficult time," Heinrich said. "For me, this isn't a sporting issue, it's a problem for Jan."    even if he took some e recreationally (which really is the only thing making sense here, no point to take amphetamines as a cyclist, unless you're in the middle of a race - no point in taking amphetamines to give yourself the edge while in rehab), it quite simply means his career is over. it takes more to repeatedly win the tdf than the poor show he's been delivering these past few months.  anyway. it's the start of the tour and i can't be there. bummer.

       urlLink Friday Five!  on a  Friday!   1. where are you right now?  am sitting in the backoffice of my mother's bookshop, at a computer not connected to the net. oh shame. this computer and its contents are almost historic (pentium,  win 95, 2 GB, 32 MB RAM). have been sitting here much of the afternoon, alternating writing eMails  that i send off at the one computer that does connect with the net, with dealing with clients when the two employees working need further help. just sold a cooking book. - tried to convince the customer to take "happy days with the naked chef" which he deeemed to expensive though. bummer. will spend the rest of the afternoon altenraitng serving customers and typing stuff here, before i get to lock teh shop up at 6:30, count the money and take it home.   2. what have you lost recently?  i rarely loose things, actually. the last thing i lost was probably my beloved pearl earring that just wasn't where i put it (i.e. my left earlobe) at the end of a hectic day in april.   3. what was the first CD you ever purchased? does that embarrass you now?  the first cd i ever bought was rödelheim hartreim projekt: "direkt aus rödelheim", a german hip hop album. i bought it in october 1994 (even though i personally didn't own a cd player until 1997, quite shocking indeed, i have all u2 albums till 1997 as albums, including tons of fucking awesome bootlegs) at a cd shop in muenster, germany, and mainly because of one song "keine ist", which was "my" song with thorsten. had heard that song for the first time on a drunken "showdown" night in july that year, when i couldn't grasp why he'd play that kind of song for me, yet didn't want a relationship. the cd would be the soundtrack to many visits in muenster, a few dates & some sex with frank and a pretty terrible, aggressive night of sex with thorsten. so listening to that cd sparks many memories, hence i don't do that too often. it doesn't embarass me to own this cd, it's a pretty classic piece of german hiphop, and i still buy cds produced by the two guys who ran the rödelheim hartreim projekt. the first record that i bought was BROS first (and last?) album, that purchase took place in december 1988, and if i still had a record player, i'd prolly still listen to it occasionally, when drunk. he.   4. what is your favorite kind of writing pen?  i'm a multi pen person. right now, i love the violet gel pen i bought. it smells like fake strawberries, and is the type of pen i owned 18 years ago. that aside, i like the ballpoint pen i got from swatch when i bought my watch: it's see-through and red, and has a heart with a tiny little lightbulp at the other end that lights up when you write. for good & important writing, my pelikan fountain pen, which i got as a pressie from my godmother when i graduated, is best.   5. what is your favorite ice cream flavor?  bacio, pure and simple bourbon-vanilla and häagen dasz cookies & cream.

      things are better.  they were already better last night, after reading evan's eMail. could still kick myself though. argh. would have so wanted to see gomez. argh. argh. argh.  oh well. worst thing about this recent drama is that now my urge to check and re-check everything is at an all time high. ocd in full swing. last night when i arrived at home after closing up the shop, i had to drive back to the shop to check whether i had indeed locked the door. i couldn't remember whether i had done my usual door locking ritual (lock door twice, press down doorhandle three times while loudly saying  "the door is locked" ). nice.  also started insanely detailed to-do and pack-lists for my trip. i will indeed list every piece of clothing i intend to pack, otherwise i'll just shove my entire wardrobe into my suitcase (end up paying for excess luggage, take clothing i won't wear), forget presents for half the people who should get some or stuff i don't urgently need but still "need" (such as all the recipes i transcribed yesterday, advance bought tickets for the train ride, or i'll find myself in frankfurt early on a monday morning without money to buy a ticket home)  bloody hell, i will not let that kind of slip happen again.  that aside, things here are hectic. one of my mother's employees decided to call in sick today (and informed someone else -not me directly- that she'll be away well into next week), which left me and another employee trying to organize back-up. back-up that took the form of me this afternoon, and will be me tomorrow, too. nice. wanted to have a quiet day at home, doing some cleaning and washing and ironing, and instead it's hell in  a handbasket at the shop. oh well. will have to do the housestuff later tonight then - my ocd hasn't kicked in regarding orderliness here yet, since wednesday, i've been terribly negligent regarding feeding myself & keeping things pretty and neat, i.e. i am overeating and haven't even bothered to put the empty marshmallow bags, oreo snack pack wrappers and empty pespsi max bottles into the bin. they are nicely displayed on the couch table, in a pretty array with my 12 year old gameboy, several books, my to-do lists and a variety of  urlLink tour de france  magazines.  speaking about the latter, i will not get a chance to go to luxembourg to see the prologue tomorrow. it's breaking my heart, but with the current situation at the shop, there's no chance for me to get away for the entire day. plus i still don't feel quite fit enough for the long drive and all. instead, i'll work my bum off till 2pm and spend the afternoon at the summer party of my grandmother's nursery home. doesn't that sound terribly entertaining? will make sure though to be home by 5 when the tv coverage kicks in. sorry, i am horrible enough to choose the tdf over my grandma. yes.  she's been in an pretty "wannabe-in-a-bad-mood"-mood today, did not say a nice word about the new dress i brought in for her and kept saying  "no. no. no. no"  and complaining about feeling sick, which is nothing but psychosomatic. both complaints are the pillars of her tried and tested method of getting attention. a few years back, when still in the middle of her prescription drug dependance, she spend a few months saying nothing but "no" and a few decades residing in her bed with a view of the main entrance of our house, ushering my grandpa basically was her private servant. when he died, her main feeling was "how did he dare leave me while i needed him". her doc diagnosed anything from rheumathoid arthritis to parkinson's and whatever else, and supplied her with all the meds she needed (indluding lots of diazepam). thing is, she never was "sick" in any way. when she was admitted for her drug dependance and all-round mental health issues, she was totally taken of all meds, lost tons of weight and sudednly had no more health problems to speak of. oh well. in any way, today when i didn't support her crappy behaviour but instead told her  no, we'll go to the party tomorrow , and  no, i didn't think your not going to your scheduled programme today was a good idea , and  no, i won't stay any longer to be yelled at , she got all soft and wanted to talk and yadayadayada. i hate her being in a nursery home, i'd rather shoot myself before ever living in one while still fit in the head (and at almost 92, my grandma is surprisingly fit in the head, no dementia, nothing. no one knows how her brain got through all the morphine derivates, but it did, somehow), but i couldn't imagine having to care for her. i just could not and would not do it. it doesn't mean i don't love her, but her manipulative crap just makes me wild, which in turn makes me feel guilty, because after all, this is a 92 year old lady with massive bouts of agitated depression (she's scratched herself bloody, hit her head against the wall and the like, during and after her detox) and i should be accepting and understanding and loving, but i just can't be at all times. but i don't want to be, either. and the latter is pure revenge and hatred caused by how she raised my mother, how she always preferred my uncle to her, how she was always the egoistic empress of her household, how she doesn't listen, says hurtful things to me.  which brings me to  jonathan franzen's "the corrections", a book on a family not held together by love or compassion. i read it in just about 48 hours lasz weekend, that shows how fucking awesome that book is. some scenes hit very close to home, some descriptions and pictures were just perfectly crafted and captured and so vivid they hurt. by far one of the best books i've read in years. strongly discouraged my mother to read it, because if she's got any insight, it'll hit even closer to home for her.  oh well.  in any way, i'll be a good granddaughter tomorrow, take my gandma out to the party and leave by 5pm -hopefully still with my dignity intact- to recharge in front of the tv, revelling in the pleasure of seeing  urlLink lance  on a bike, hopefully wearing the yellow at the end of the day.

      i am standing in front of this stupid pc, crying, because evan send me the perfect email, the right words, as his reaction to the cryptric message regarding plane ticket & gomez that i left on his machine earlier today.    "will your plane arrive later than expected? if so, don't stress. it's not tragic. sure it would have been nice to see gomez with you, but as long as you come, it really doesn't matter. I'd have to find a new birthday present for you, but a few hours in a large bed would suffice, wouldn't they?(...) love you, no matter whether you arrive at 6pm, 10pm or at 3am. most important thing is that you arrive, and arrive happy and whole.    he's perfect, i tell you. second time i cry today because of what i feel for him. around noon, while driving from the diy store to the carpenter,  urlLink "private emotion" by ricky martin  came on at bfbs, the  terrible song used as the soundtrack to our tv appearance, but i just couldn't help but think about how fucking awesome it is, that scene, the camera circling us while we kiss in that cinema, both of us really happy and beaming and evans hand ruffling my hair shining brightly in the camera light. :)  i'm a lucky girl, and i just shouldn't forget how fabulous he is, my boy. how blessed i am to have him in my life and love him and be loved by him.

      shoot me, the wannabe globetrotter. or at least kick me real hard. or please, please teach me how to read plane tickets; how to figure out timezones and flights.  packing up some of the important stuff for my trip (think visa, health insurance, ticket), i decided to take another look at my flight plan. which was a good idea really. should have done that weeks ago, and would have done that every day had the ticket & flight plan not been stored in a safe space at my parents place.  looking at that printed plan, on green "kangaroo tours" (honest, that's the name of my travel agent) paper, i realized -instnatly in a panic, that i will indeed arrive at 5:50am, like initially thought. not at 5:50pm, as evan currently believes and as i believed until a few hours ago.  that wouldn't be that tragic, were it not for the following: i arrive at 5:50am on the 25th. not at 5:50pm on the 24th. which means that i'll touch aussie ground a fucking 9 hours  after  the gomez concert i got tickets for from evan.  fucking hell, i've done that down-under travel thing twice and still haven't figured out that day-losing thing?! how could i have been stupid enough to think i could leave germany in the evening of the 23rd and arrive in australia on the evening of the 24th and hence take just about 22 hours?! to everyone who can calculate a wee bit, a 20 hour flight (stop over time not included) plus 8 hours time difference make for more than 22 hours.  fucking hell.  i should wear the idiot cap and hide in a corner for the next week.  am so so sad about missing out on ben ottwell. but am heartbroken that evan and i won't get to start our time together in the middle of a gomez concert, reliving the awesome concert two years ago. sure, it would have been hectic. it would have been stressful to worry about the plane being on time so i wouldn't be late for the cocnert. but fucking hell, i would have still  gone  to the concert.  now how do i tell the toyboy to find someone else to use my birthday present with?  :(  have been unable to get hold of him today. and just do not feel like passing these news on via email. i've blown it. again. i wish i had some useful excuse, but i don't. it's just my stupidity, and inability. yup, the first flight plan i got was barely readable. but bloody hell, that new plan has been in my parents possesion for what - 6 weeks?- and i didn't  check  and triple check again? for once, i don't practice my usual obsessive compulsive behaviour and am quite happy about that, and that's when i blow it.  see how fucking useless and stupid i am?

      I've been up since 4am, when I had to taxi my parents to the bus that'll take them and their friends to Italy.  Now I'm not only still sick (even though the antibiotics and the ambroxol seem to finally kick in), in the middle of first day menstrual cramps, but also tired. And I'll have to spend much of the day working in the bookshop. Oh, and it's raining.  Feel like cuddling up with a hot water bottle and a video and not leaving the house at all. Ack.

       urlLink Friday Five . It's only Monday, after all.   When was the last time you...  1. ...sent a handwritten letter?  the last time i wrote an extensive post card (which in my book is a quasi-letter) was when i fixed a package for my boy,  in april.    2. ...baked something from scratch or made something by hand?  the last time i baked was saturday night. i made a tin of fuckin awesome  urlLink midnight brownies  after a recipe from  urlLink shauny  and a self invented, terribly patriotic black-red-gold (sort off) striped marble cake for the world cupo BBQ. Strangely enough, the red stripes actually didn't taste all that bad. The last thing aesthetically pleasing thing i made by hand lately was probably packing some pressies for a friend of my mothers, two weeks ago.   3. ...camped in a tent?  14 years ago, at my goodbye trip from primary school in 1988. I'm not a big fan of tents.   4. ...volunteered your time to church, school, or community?  I regularly volunteer at my local Planned parenthood, even though I had to significantly cut down my hours lately. I jkust am not in a position where I can afford to work for free, or at all besides school. And the atmo there has suffered immensely lately, too. Not a good place to volunteer at the moment, much too stressful.   5. ...helped a stranger?  I regularly go up to lost looking tourists in the street asking whether I can help in any way, does that count? That aside, I am terribly kind and help women with strollers or old ladies on buses or the tram at all times.

      Evan had his final ever med exam today. Hooray!  His last exam patient ever was a poor chap: a 35 years old guy with diabetes that had damaged one of his eyes (and had made him go blind on that one) and his kidneys and had made him need a kidney transplant; he had lost his other eye in a fishing accident (and was hence almost completely blind); on tp of that, he was also an alcoholic dependent heroin smoker, severely depressed and suicidal (had attempted suicide a few weeks back) and had just now been hospitalised for an infection caused by the immunosuppresants he was on because of his kidney transplant. Duh. Quite a complicated case to get to know in an hour and discuss in about 15 minutes. - He was apparently quite helpful though, kept poiting Evan to things other docs always looked at and asked about, and overall, it must have been intresting, if a bit hectic and rushed.  Am terribly proud of and happy for Evan. - He's worked very hard these past years, and it's strange that it's now done and over, that he'll get his results in three weeks, find out about his hospital for his intern year, get registered and then -in January- start working as a real doctor. What a shock. So very grown up and real. :) So good that he now gets some time off first. He truly deserves it.  Wish I could empty some bottles of  champagne with him today and have some lovely, drunk celebratory doctor & nurses games with my very own Dr.Toyboy. He. :)

       urlLink Friday Five!    1. How many TVs do you have in your home?   One.   2. On average, how much TV do you watch in a week?  Hard to tell. Probably about 20 or so, as I have the telly running when I do housework, cook, am online, eat alone, etc, etc. I rarely really *watch* (as in: do nothing else), only during the holy hour of the week, when Buffy is on.   3. Do you feel that television is bad for young children?  Depends on the amount, the kind of show, and whether it is unsupervised or not. Some TV, carefully selected, supervised and discussed with parents, and levelled with other activities (sports, reading, arts, music) can not harm. Unsupervised "parking of the kids in front of the TV" for hours, however, can be harmful, IMHO. I know some families who do not have TV connection (but a VCR) at home, and that's a concept I find quite intrigeuing.   4. What TV shows do you absolutely HAVE to watch, and if you miss them, you're heartbroken?  Buffy and Angel. Twin Peaks re-runs, and episodes of "7th Heaven" that I haven't seen yet.   5. If you had the power to create your own television network, what would your line-up look like?  Unbiased news, Buffy, Angel, Twin Peaks, BBC health documentaries and lots of artsy european movies.

      fab news today: a friend of mine from melbourne got engaged to his girlfriend last weekend, they plan to get married next june am extremely and utterly happy for them, they are such a close, connected, loving couple, it's breathtaking. always makes me happy to see people like them commit to each other, being sure they have met their life partner.  got a bit sad though, because of these news this afternoon, quite suddenly, and pondered why that happened. it's easy: i want to be with the one person who i feel is my life partner, too, and want that right now. not in a few months, or next year.  feel disconnected and alone, and hate working in the bookshop, and being alone in this big dark house with the cat who hates me. got enough money from the shop that i could afford to head to the airport tonight. it't tempting. would mean though, that i'd never have any contact with my family ever again, which -as much as i sometimes dislike them- would probably make me need a few more years of therapy. duh.

      i miss tina.  it's been three days back in this now tina-less town, and i just don't like it. we've been talking tons, long phone calls every day, and chats via messenger, but that's hardly a substitute for friendship facetime.  have no idea how i am going to get through life here without her around, without going to the gym together, doing our washing at dieter's, shopping at dm, wasting time when we should be studying by watching th heaven and sharing cups of tea. she's even more lonely in her new town, in the far east of austria, in a flat with an odd flatmate, writing sad stories about loneliness. i wish we could somehow merge our lives again.  there's just no substitute for your best friend.  hmph.

      so where should i start? impossible to jot down all that happened in the past 2 1/2 months. i'm speechless, i guess. somehow saying that it was  "perfect with ev, fabulous at work, and a great time overall"  says nothing at all, even though all that *is* true. and then: what should i talk about anyway? i spend time with the man i know is my lifepartner & soulmate (excuse the clichés), i had a fab job with a fab boutique intellectual property firm, i fell in love with melbourne again and again and again, i met with friends, did power lunches, ogled real estate with evan, went on dates with him, went to the footie most weekends, cooked meals for the family, was happy and loved and having a life.  it was simple. it was normal. it was right.  that is "all" that happened, even though all that is big news in my book. there are few news about rings, promises and weddings, no tales of exciting travel (i dismissed all initial plans, for the place i felt i wanted to be was melbourne, and melbourne alone), a few bad news about money needed for uni, but surprisingly good news regarding immigration.  it's propably the simplicity and normalcy of the life i had in melbourne that makes it so difficult to talk or write about. there is little that seems interesting enough for an outside person, whereas for me and evan, that normalcy has been the great outcome os this. the fact we got along as perfectly as we did after the usual fit-in time, the way we managed to work through a few issues, make plans for the future, work and study full time yet make time for ourselves and fall into rituals that make us both feel connected - that has been the fabulous, fabulous realisation of this whole trip. it's what we hoped would happen, and it happened. and it was even better than expected. that's the little big news of it all.  i've been this speechless ever since coming back. no one has wanted to hear much about my time away so far, and it's all still tied up inside me, not having been reflected upon. it's not written down anywhere yet,  and i feel like i have to, to make it last and to hold on to it. feels very odd. i've been back for a week and a half, and in a way it feels like years since i left melbourne. it was the same the other way round: arriving at evans place, i felt like i had been away for a week or two, not two years. the two months felt like a century to me, yet passed by in a flash. blame it on aforementioned normalcy.  did i miss journaling? i did. a little. but there was just no time for it. life was busy - quite strange considering how few extraordinay things happened. work took up lots of time, the evenings were filled with homey things, family dinners and dates with the boy, the weekends taken up my runs in the morning, hours over the papers, evans work and his studygroup and my strolling through melbourne with jasmine, a gal i met on a tourbus in singapore. as if that wasn't enough, i was extremely tired much of the time, falling asleep as soon as i sat down in front of  urlLink mda  (no, not caused by jason donovan, i *wanted* to watch that show, so hilariously funny, so much wrong wrong wrong med and law) or friday night footie. i suspect something is actually wrong with my thyroid (hypothyroidism) - tiredness, memory trouble, slight weight gain, being cold, gi trouble, odd periods, hair loss and whatever other symptoms i have, all point to this. to top this off, my entire family has thyroid issues, too (my father had hypothyroidism, my ma and grandma hyperthyroidism), and now i have an appointment with my doc next monday to clear this up.  so now i am back in germany, and all i want is finish up my stuff and get back to my boy and melbourne. it's weird to be here. this city feels empty, tina is gone, and the work i thought i'd have before the semester isn't there -  i could have stayed 2 weeks longer. duh. no that there isn't enough study to be done anyway. have been avoiding it so far though, am sick and crampy and tired, the contents of my suitcase are all in a big pile in the middle of my room. need to clean this flat, sort my wardrobe, tidy up. weird, how a flat can get dusty while noone is there. need to pick myself up, live in the now, be active. the usual.  doesn't help that i can almost count down the days until i fly back, for yet another interim stay before it's finally final. will be in oz for 4 weeks over christmas, evan and i will share the cost of the ticket. there'll be no work, no study, just lots of free time and together time, summer, christmas in merimbula, house hunting for his place down by the beach in ocean grove.  i'll book next week. hooray.

      i exorcised some more demons of the past today and threw away a 3ft stack of old cosmos.  every bit that i've thrown away these past days has made me feel better. dropping my old clothes into the clothes donation box today, i literally felt a weight falling from my shoulders, knowing someone would wear my clothes and be warmed this winter by the really neat, thick benetton lambswool jumpers i did not feel like wearing anymore.  owing less stuff makes me feel free.

      i've been busy -  urlLink working out , studying,  urlLink working off my to do list , getting ready to leave for a weekend with the parents on thursday. am quite looking forward to the weekend actually (which is strange in itself), am getting my hair cut (at least a tiny little bit) & highlighted on friday, will do all my holiday (in both the going away and the christmassy sense) shopping and trip to ikea, and on sunday, my dad's choir has their annual advent concert, which i am looking forward to because i'll miss out on their singing on christmas, after all.  that aside, i am surprisingly calm about leaving in just about  urlLink 15 days , apart from my stressedoutness about all the things i still have to do to prepare for my trip, christmas and my houseguests.  somehow, i just haven't realised yet, that i am almost there again, i guess. it's not that i am not excited, or not looking forward to  being with evan and in melbourne again. - i am longing for evan, for being with him, having free time with him, summer and  moving and everything else. - but i am still calm. strange. i guess part of it is the fact that it still feels like i have just returned. maybe it's also because this is the shortest time that evan and i have been apart between visits - just little more than 2 months. another reason is that i still -as always- have the feeling that something, anything is going to happen that will prevent me from going after all. - and then there is all the work that's still between me and leaving: all that cleaning up and sorting and packing and whatever else. i spend a chunk of the afternoon in my cellar, cleaning up and throwing things out, and sorting clothing i haven't worn in a while. will drag a whole big blue ikea bag full of stuff to the clothing collection place to donate it. makes me feel good: it's decent clothing after all, just stuff that i don't want anymore, not stuff that is inherently ugly, bad or old, and i am happy someone else will be able to enjoy it soon. only downside to all this cleaning is that i am all itchy from the dust, and have been for the last few days of digging between my shelves. need a shower, quite urgently.  that much for now. am quite braindead from all this stuff that needs to be done... maybe it wasn't such a good idea to offer these houseguests to be here while i am not. but then, saying no wasn't an option either, considering this is my future bosses' wife & kids (and hey, they really *are* terribly lovely). still am a tad worried. all needs to be super tidy and nice. need to remember to move sextoys from current living space in the top drawer of my chest of drawers.  anyway.  little more than 2 weeks from now, i'll be in melbourne. so much planned already, family christmas party on the day that i arrive, cricket on the next day, moving, going to merimbula, roatripping along the great ocean road (finally!), lots of lovin' ...with all this ahead, i am sure i'll get excited soon enough. :)  he.

      i realised that i still hold the childlike belief that no one that i know and care about will ever die.  death scares me. the finality of it scares me.  the shock about nils being dead is still there, even though i am starting to grasp it. i wish i had a belief, a religion, anything that would give me rituals to do, prayers to say, just something to do to mark his passing. heather mentioned that this is not only difficult because i found out about this in such an impersonal way, but also because all markings of mourning, a funeral, a memorial service (if something like that was held in the first place) passed without me.  when stephan died, 8 years ago (i had to calculate this, it seems like a century, he would have been 27 today - what would he have been doing? would he have had a partner? kids? what kind of job?), the mourning with our friends, the rituals, the mass, the funeral, the wake, as horrible as they were, as little as i remember specifics, helped.  now nils is dead and i missed it all, missed the news, missed the mourning.  i feel guilty.  we lost touch because we were never directly connected. i knew him through didi. all i ever was for him was didi's girlfriend. - and that was ok. their friendship had been longstanding and firm, and i wasn't important in that context. it was clear that no matter whether i would stay with didi or not, their friendship would remain and have precedence over my knowing of n. an ex-girlfriend had once tried to utilise their friendship, and had failed.  i remember being excited about meeting nils. for the first time. there had been lots of built-up prior to it, didi. had told me so many stories about him, about their adventures during their civil service at the bird watching station on fehmarn, about sharing a tiny flat in hamburg's st.georg district. didi. loved him, to the point of idolisation sometimes. nils was a lot that didi wasn't, and it showed sometimes, that he wanted to measure up. didi always said that the one man he could love was nils. yes, this comment made me wish for a threesome that never happened. he.  when i finally met him for the first time, it was at the backyard office of the publishing house he and his two mates had started a while back. i think didi was about to leave for his four month research trip to brasil, and wanted to say goodbye, i can't quite remember. what i do remember though, is that nils and i, we liked each other. i was majorly attracted to him (and felt guilty about that, too). - but how could one not be attracted to him? he was tall and beautiful in a casual sort of way. he was easygoing and smart and daring and grande in his thoughts. he'd put on his smartest suit, ring the doorbell of hamburg's most exclusive private banks and after presenting an immaculately designed financial concept, leave with a loan in hand. once he travelled to namibia to convince a german authour living there to let him publish his autobiography about living in the namib desert during wwii. he was living the high life, often in debt, but he didn't care. was he reliable? for his mates - always. he was always there for didi when he needed him, but in other regards, he was reckless: driving too fast, driving when drunk, which i found intolerable, unless i was so drunk i couldn't reject his offers of driving us somewhere.  nils was a firm believer that things would always work out somehow. and as long as i knew him, they always did.  that first time we met, he gave me a book they were co-distributing, a book called tiger by indonesian authour mochtar lubis, which i liked because of it's unusual imagery, so far removed from anything european i had ever read. every time we met, we'd talk about books and music and he'd recommend stuff and i'd borrow it from him, sometimes trite stuff, like a biography on billy joel. we clicked through books. the last time we met, he made me a copy of serge gainsbourgs "coleur cafe", which i took down here, played to my then best friend, and for weeks, we'd be singing and dancing to that tape, and just that tape alone. this past friday night i put it on again, singing along, swaying my hips during "cha cha cha du loup" and mourning with serge during "les armours perdues".  the last time we met was a in march or april 1999, my relationship with didi would last another month and then slowly dwindle to an end. that night, didi and i met nils at the publishing house again, tripped to his tiny (almost straight out of wallpaper) flat on elbchaussee after stopping at the petrol station to buy wine, listened to serge gainsbourg, and smoked and drank and talked. by then, he was already planning his move out of the publishing house, wanting to start up something alone, possibly distributing rare maps for bookshops, in the long run wanting to live in the carribean with his partner. later that night, we went go to a tiny italian bar in st.pauli where nils was welcomed by the maitre'd like a long lost son. as usual, all heads turned towards him as he entered the place. we spend the night working through several bottles of excellent red, ate pasta and smoked terrible amounts (back then, i still smoked) and talked. nils wrote his email addie on a coaster - i looked for it yesterday, but couldn't find it. for once, the hoarder in me did not keep something but must have thrown it away some time ago.  that night,  when we were done with the smoking and drinking, nils decided he had to drive didi and me home, to the opposite end of town, totally not his direction. yes, this was irresponsible and stupid on all our parts. it must have been past 2am when we arrived at home, i think, and didi and i just fell into bed, drunk and exhausted. nils, however, didn't get much sleep that night, because a few hundred metres from didi's house, he was caught by a booze bus, his car seized, his licence taken (and quite rightly so, never any excuses for drunk driving, ever), and he spend several hours at the nearby police station before he was allowed to go. he spend like 150 marks on a taxi back to his place, several hundred on the fine, the re-test, transport for his licence-less time. late the next day, he gave us a call to tell us what happened, but wasn't angry at all. we asked him why he hadn't just come to our place when he was released by the police, but he hadn't wanted to wake us up. geez. nils neither held a grudge about this nor accepted the money we offered to cover parts of the fine or a public transport ticket for the time he was license-less.  after my relationship with didi broke up, i never heard of nils again. no wonder, i wasn't even talking to didi, and hadn't heard anything directly from him until this past summer, when i emailed him from melbourne, sparked by a conversation with a mutual friend, who said he hadn't heard from him in years, either.  and now nils is dead.  i always thought i'd hear from him again in some way, cross paths with him. i always thought he would succeed, always expected him to make headlines one day. - i never thought i would never see him again. i had checked on him online a good long while ago, maybe 2 years or so, checking the website of the publishing house, discovering that he had indeed left completely by then.  and now i will -most likely- never see him again.  i should know, life ends, we'll all die, eventually. one moment people are there, the next they are not.  but i just can't handle it.  it scares me, nils's death. not just because he, one of most beautiful people who ever crossed my paths, smart, intelligent, friendly, is gone, but also because knowing so little details makes this very sudden.  i don't know anything (yet) that might explain his death, might offer resolution, might relieve my fear and sudden realisation that anyone i know can die, despite their young age, anytime, just because. did he have some undiscovered heart problems? myocarditis? had he been taking drugs? of course i know that everyone i love might die, car crashes, diseases, they take the young.  but still.  no one should have a heart attack at 28.  this morning, while working out (of all things) my thoughts started to turn to nils's death, to the process of dying. what was it like for him? did he have time to think  "so this is dying" ? was he scared? had he had any symptoms before it? any warning signs? i hope it went by quickly, i hope he wasn't in pain, i hope he wasn't too scared, i hope he wasn't alone. i hope nils transitioned to a place as beautiful as his new found home on st.lucia.  i remember having similar thoughts with stephan, who died in his sleep. he had had nightly convulsions in the past and had told me he never noticed them until the next morning, when he was exhausted and had usually bitten his tongue or lips. somehow, knowing that he hadn't felt these attacks in the past gave me hope he wasn't in pain or conscious when he died, ironically enough while he was wearing a 24-hour ecg that - had he had it earlier- might have helped in discovering the underlying reasons for his disease & death.  i hope life isn't just over, which i -in my agnostic moments- sometimes think.  i hope there is something good afterwards, of whatever kind. what a waste it would be if there wasn't, if all the beauty and intelligence and love that stephan and nils had just evaporated into nothing, leaving nothing but a faint imprint in the hearts and souls of those who knew them. but then - even if there is nothing afterwards - of course the imprints both of them left are far from faint. but still. one day everyone who remembers them, remembers how shy and humble and loyal stephan was, or everyone who remembers nils, his beauty, his intelligence, his abilities, will be gone, too.  i wish i could believe, trust, rely on knowing nothing, no one, no one's memory was ever lost.  but i can't.

      the pain is still acute. just beneath the surface.  tidying up, and throwing out, and de-cluttering, and cleaning up has helped in keeping my mind occupied though, and has been satisfying, too. however, i realised that i am de-personalising my flat for my upcoming visitors, and that's strange in itself, even though i like this clutter-less-ness. quite freeing. but still so much work to do...  but above all, some mourning, too.

      i have been cleaning up for much of the afternoon, sorting through my drawers and assorted papers, throwing lots of stuff away. this place needs to be in shape when my houseguests arrive, and toning down on stuff now will mean less work when i leave in a few months.  i stumbled upon the catalogue of a publishing house that friends of my ex-boyfriend ran. mastermind behind the publishing house was nils, civil service mate of my ex, extremely smart, beautiful, talented, reckless, living the high life. i wondered how he is, haven't been in much contact with my ex since we split up in mid 1999, and hence hadn't heard anything about nils, either, and now that i got online i thought i'd type his name into google (you know, like i often do with people), just to see what he's been up to.   and the first hit is a memorial page for nils.   he died last december, 12 days before his 29th birthday, from a heart attack. it is him, too, not someone with the same name. there's a picture of him, as strikingly beautiful as i remember him, sitting on a beach, the wind ruffling his hair.  i am terribly sad.

       in other news:  my recent obsession with the past has reached new heights (or lows, depending on the definition), yet again. the book i ordered because i  wondered whether he might be in there  was indeed one hell of a good guess.  it arrived at my moms shop today, she saw the title, called me and asked whether he was in there, and when i said i didn't know, she looked it up, and there he was, or rather, that piece on and a drawing of him, and my mom got all excited and started reading it to me.  i told her to stop reading it to me, that i wanted to do that myself, and could she please remember  urlLink not to tell his mother that i've been succesfully searching him out , yet again, when she comes into the shop to finally pick up that book she recently ordered?  he. knowing her, i am sure she'll spill it, no matter how much she tries not to, simply because she'll be so excited about it next time his mother's there.

      evan found out about his intern placement today: he got the place at the hospital he wanted to be at. his soon-to-be-housemate suzy got her place there, too.  the letter they send him today was the first ever addressed to "Dr." Evan. :)  it's getting real, this transition into the workforce, adulthood, responsibility, moving out. i am so excited for and proud of him, if a little worried because it will take even more work for us to stay connected and happy and well through this time of change. but we'll be alright, i am sure. this is the first step of so many changes happening in the next year or so: his being an intern, my graduating, my emigration. it's scary, but exciting, and needed. i am so ready for us to move closer.  how can anything not be alright when i'll be there in  urlLink 21 days  to be part of the change? :)

      i dreamt of you last night.  what in all the world were you doing there, in my head, at night?  it was a strange dream i had there, you visited me at my parents house, and we talked and i tried to impress you, like i've always tried, tried to get you to tell me what you've been up to, but alas, you didn't react to the prompts i gave you, like you've ignored them in the past, too.  strangely enough, you went into the garden to meet some people i've never met, but who i knew to be (you know how it is in dreams, there are some things one just knows) your new writing fellows, who i know you all secretly thought to be a bunch of thinking too much, taking themselves too serious idiots.  the earth began to shake as i was in a light filled room facing the garden, watching you and your new mates, all wearing  "we're all such literary genius"  1970's style clothing, standing around an old alfa romeo, talking, and i crouched on the floor, trying to protect myself from falling wall parts, and i worried about being injured and thought you'd all be safe outside.  and then i slowly woke up, all the while wishing the dream would continue so that i could go out into the garden to talk to you further, because i knew you'd be leaving with them, soon.  but i woke up. and for a moment i was indeed happy to have seen you again.  so tell me, what the hell was that about?

      last night, already in bed, ready to sleep, i zapped into a lovely documentary on  urlLink armistead maupin  and his muchly beloved  urlLink tales of the city .  it was fabulous. not only is he a charming, smart man, who writes awesome books, but the docu was well made, too, with little over-voiced readings that perfectly captured what makes these books and their characters so lovable. among other things,a camera followed maupin to some tales locations, and now i finally know what the  urlLink marina safeway  and the come clean center  really  look like. he. :) i indeed have to visit san francisco at least once in my life.  the nicest thing, however, about the whole thing was that armistead talked about michael "mouse" tolliver, who is -for me- the most lovable character of the series. he spoke about people thanking him that he had not written any follow up to "sure of you", because that would have meant a mouse-less book, because he sure must have died of aids by then. - just my worries, indeed. - i remember reading  urlLink the night listener , looking for clues how mouse was (maupin often cross-references between books, and there were some tales people in the night listener). - but there were none there.  but alas, maupin pointed out: mouse is not dead.  he went on explaining that as mouse got infected around the same time his former partner terry anderson got infected, and as terry is -thanks to the combination therapy and luck, i take- still alive and well, he thinks mouse is still alive, too. so mouse and anderson are both part of that small club of long-term survivors. which is fabulous.  for some reason, that made me very very happy.  i fell asleep listening to my tales cd.

      thanks to phil, who runs  urlLink tütensuppe experience , my day improved by a few hundred percent this afternoon. gracious person that he is, he provided me with an mp3 of "die waffe" by nationalgalerie, which has been running non stop on my winamp ever since the download was complete.  now let me explain why this leaves me all excited and emotional (which is not solely due to the alcohol consumed at the laundromat today).  i've been looking for this song for years, remembering it faintly, never being able to find it online, the cd long unavailable in the shops, the one person i was sure owned the cd not exactly the person i would ever approach to ask for a tape.  until this afternoon, i had only ever heard the song -at least consciously- once before, at a party in august 1994, totte's 19th birthday party, a week or so after our friend stephan's funeral, which had taken place at totte's actual birthday.  it was a strange party, that one. how can you party when someone you've spend your entire summer with had just been buried? how can you party when there are so many things that had been left unsaid?  we, our summer group of friends, tried, but we couldn't really, if i remember it correctly. i remember that totte had purchased the cheapest beer available for the party, partly to discourage party crasher turning up for free booze. it was indeed horrible beer ( urlLink "oettinger" ), yet it served the purpose: we got drunk, somewhow.   i also remember that hardly anyone danced that night, in the disco cellar of the youth center of our church, where i would have my "almost 18" goodbye party before leaving to new zealand roughly two years later, too.  i remember having to leave relatively early, that night, not that i remember why. so i went downstairs, to where totte and his friend volker had been playing their kind of music - to hardly anyone in the room all night, to say goodbye. almost everyone had sat upstairs, drinking, talking casually about nothing in particular, eating the fabulous vegetarian food totte had provided. i had just wanted to say goodbye, but when i came into the dj booth to do just that, totte told me to just stay for one more song, and that's when he put on nationalgalerie's "die waffe". i had listened to their album  urlLink "indiana"  for much of the summer, not getting "ruhe vor dem sturm" out of my head, so i instantly recognised niels frevert's voice, and we danced and jumped around, totte and me, just the two of us, quite wildly, too, him singing along to the song, that august night in the downstairs disco of the youth centre.  when the song was over, it was time for me to say goodbye, and i said goodbye, and we hugged, for the first time since the day we had found out about stephan's death, i think, holding on to each other for several minutes, him telling me to stay longer. i can still remember what it felt like, that hug. so much had been upside down and inside out in the previous months and weeks and days, and the only thing i felt like was holding on to him and what i felt for him. i was still all head over heels in love with him, still thought it would all work out in the end, somehow. which it didn't. how good you rarely know these things in advance. we rested, the two of us, in this hug, as we did every time we touched each other, which we didn't on a regular basis from a certain point on, always asking the other whether it was okay to hug, always my defences breaking down when we agreed, often attempting to kiss him, which we would't do again until the night of his accident a few weeks later. looking back, knowing that he is sorry he backed out of this, it seems to me as if we were holding on to each other back then hoping to preserve the moment to change it. we weren't together, after all. if both hoping that we were.  and now i am listening to the song again, for the first time in more than 8 years. i am well aware that part of my response to this song is due to the anticipation, to the searching out and tracking down and to my cyclic melancholic looking back on my first love ever.  it's good to have the song now. i can reclaim it as a part of my memories of that summer, i can enjoy it and listen to it, and dance and be sad and happy and let it go,  once i feel like doing so. meeting totte two years ago and talking about our relationship and hearing that he wished it had been different enabled me to make peace with the way things had been and not constantly ponder  we could have been so good together  anymore. once my anger about  the things that migth have been  had subsided, i could accept and let go of it a little more.  and now this awesome, energetic, passionate song is just one more way of remembering what was that night, that summer, and of course it's a way to remember what could have been, too. but it's just that, the trigger to some good memories and some bad memories, a damn good song. it's nothing that throws me off the rails into hours of sadness and wonder about how stupid and young i was at 16.  the song is too good to ruin it by attaching bad, sad memories to it. after all, the feeling i had that night at the party, despite stephan's death just days before, was too good, too. sure, i was terribly and utterly devastated, but this party was, in a way, our way to reclaim a sense of normalcy after the mourning and burying. and i was in love, head over heels, and for the first time for real, i felt safe with totte and i was hopeful and positive about what would develop. all in a way that's only possible the first time it ever happens.  and that's something i really don't want to forget. ever.      "die waffe"  ~nationalgalerie~  hier nimm diese waffe von mir ein geschenk von deinem bruder soll auf ewig glück dir bringen deine süsse liebe verteidigen  für nen mann im park und die netten jungs von nebenan für papa wenn er nachts in dein zimmer kommt und mama nicht weiss was sie sagen soll  nimm diese waffe von mir diesen ring dieses lied diese waffe von mir nimm diese waffe von mir  es geht ständig klicker klick und der alptraum meldet sich zurück süsse liebe so dunkel die nacht schweissgebadet neben mir aufgewacht  ich weiss das tor ist verschlossen aber lass eine tür für mich offen ein schild auf dem steht  "achtung vorsicht! gut behandeln, inhalt zerbrechlich"   nimm diese waffe von mir diesen ring dieses lied diese waffe von mir   nimm diese waffe von mir diesen mit liebe geladenen revolver  für die die rücksicht nehmen die sich allergrösste mühe geben für den einen der da gerade neben dir liegt und jede menge kluger ratschläge gibt  nimm diese waffe von mir diesen ring dieses lied diese waffe von mir   nimm diese waffe von mir diesen mit liebe geladenen revolver

      when i am stressed and worried (and -surprise, surprise!- i am both, at the moment), i keep getting additional worries. my mind wants more for entertainment, i guess, a little bit of variety from the same worries about uni and law and moving to another country.  you know, my mind likes worries about pregnancy.   the result was that i took a preggie test yesterday, for no real reason, no missed pills, no missed periods, no torn or slipped condoms, nothing - only completely unreasonable, unfounded worries, for nothing but the thrill of my own fertility. one might think that at age 24, sexually sane and informed and in a stable loving relationship, i'd have understood that my current risk of being pregnant is low because of timely and accurate pill use (all well before their best before dates are due), a possible diagnosis of pcos and 2 withdrawal bleeds since i last had sex of any kind; but alas, it took a single blue line on a stick to make that space in my head worry-free again.  i am not sure what sparked this, aside from my aforementioned other life worries and stresses and a gym mate's brandnew pregnancy, and as a result, i am not quite sure what to do to avoid it in the future. were i someone asking for advice at  urlLink  scarleteen , i'd tell myself to consider readiness and add methods of contraception. readiness is not the question really, as these worries come up when i am stressed and not having sex, and i doubt changing contraceptive methods or adding any, would change much either. the only  option i would consider is switching to  urlLink implanon , which i am not so sure about. -i might want to have a child in the next five years.  and i guess that's it, actually. i might want to have children.  i realised, yesterday afternoon, waiting for my five minutes to pass, that what i am worried about is possibly not the  being pregnant  thing (even though that is still a mighty scary prospect) but rather  failing to recognize that i am pregnant  because of the pill's induced withdrawal bleed, being pregnant and not knowing, missing out on time to have options and unknowingly harming a fetus.  i realised that i  might  have a baby now. don't get me wrong, i am far from urgently wanting a baby, from feeling the urge to breed. - being a parent is still more responsibility for another human being than i'd want at the moment, and i still dream of marriage before children, still want to have a while alone with evan before we start thinking about having a family, i want to have a career and all. however, the older i get and the more i am sure about evan being the person i want to be with for the rest of my life, the less i think  "there is no way i could do this baby thing now" . which is a bit bizarre.  would i get pregnant, it would still be difficult, and life-changing and whatever, but it wouldn't be as big a drama, would't need as much changing of plans as it would have needed a few years back. this is not my estrogens talking here, it's just what i realised, being eerily calm  looking at the blue pigments moving over the test field of the stick.  now that's a realisation i need to take time adapting to.

      i've finally started progressing with my novel again. i am not sure i'll manage the 50.000; too far am i away from any goals i should have reached already. but well, i'll still try somehow. it's too interesting so far. a bizarre thing, this fast food novel writing, my brain has picked up all these bits and pieces from people around me, places i have been and melted them together into these characters and places that have taken on a life of their own, quite strange.  it's not biographical, at all, thankfully, because i'd just suck at that and wouldn't manage to read it, ever again. yet these characters i have come up with are just so familiar, behaving in familiar ways, yet also resolving matters never resolved in real life. i notice revenge, too. it's been satisfying, almost, finally resolving that break-up scene i've been wanting to do unto one of my characters. i wonder what his real life blueprints (all three of them, in fact) were to think if they read about him. would they recognize themselves?  i remember  urlLink stumbling over thorsten's published stories  early this year, worrying, for a milisecond, that i might be in them (yes, how narcistic of me), but of course, i wasn't. but what would i have done if i had been?  i have been travelling down memory lane a little as a result of this writing and thinking, and it's been strange, these google searches that came up with new things, reading what i've chronicled about past events, longing for my old paper journals to see whether i do remember correctly.  again, as often this time of the year, my thoughts go to frank quite a bit (& inevitably thorsten, too, so intertwined is it all) - this time around 8 years ago, i met frank for the first time, and it's been 6 years since i last heard of him, saw him. no "sort of" resolution as with thorsten 2 years ago, and that just makes me wonder, from time to time, whether i ever left an imprint in his life, whether he ever thinks of me, whether he still has that tape i gave him, the letters we sent, whether he remembers the discussions we had, whether he remembers that wednesday afternoon in may. i wonder whether whoever runs their website checks their stats, notices these regular searches for his full name and tells him about it.  i am sure if i knew he did ocassionally remember me, in a friendly way, my obsessive thoughts would return less frequently. but i don't know, and really do not feel like checking whether he does... *it is* all i want, really, not to be forgotten by someone who used to be important for me. wondering about it hurts far less than realising that he does not remember me.      something woke me up must have been the rain and for no good reason here you are inside my head again  i know i won't go back to sleep now i'm in a mood must be the midnight rain, the midnight rain  so i get up and wander around in my dressing gown put the kettle on, some music too but not too loud 'cause the neighbours complain so i keep it soft and low just about the sound of the midnight rain, midnight rain  what coast are you on? what country? is it raining there? is it morning or midnight? are you walking barefoot or have you got your shoes on? is there somebody there with you? are you talking soft and low underneath the sound of the midnight rain, midnight rain? i just want you to know where ever you are where ever you go i hope you're under a lucky star where ever you are    "midnight rain"  ~paul kelly~

      this feels like a "real" morning after. a bit sour and lonely. odd. andre eisermann should give out disclaimers with the tickets for his readings.  am still flooded with thoughts and feelings triggered by last night, which make me feel all fragile and open and lonely. miss evan.  on top of that, it's grey and raining like it is the end of the world and i got lots of work for the day, but feel directionless, overwhelmed, cold and slightly sick. if my stomach trouble keeps going this way without me taking evening primrose oil, i guess i have to see a doc this week. duh.  what a counterpoint to last nights high.

      was all housewifey this afternoon, finally doing some ironing and cleaning my kitchen. don't know why it's been so hard to motivate me for cleaning and tidying up, lately, seems almost like i have temporarily flipped out of that obsessive compulsive side of my personality.  while i was busy in the kitchen, i decided to finally renew the yellow washable foil i have on my kitchen walls, which i have wanted to do for month. was quite tricky, that fighting with big pieces of adhesive foil all alone, but much needed. didn't turn out as straight as i would have wanted, but it's good enough. need to do more of these basic little renovation things in the next few weeks. - this week, my bosses wife, di, asked me whether she, her youngest daughter and her sister can stay at my place for a few nights in january while i am in australia, and i -of course- said yes. want to be employed by her husband next year, after all. he. actually, i felt more obliged because we had wanted to catch up here, and as i'll be in australia at that time, i felt like i needed to do *something* instead. - and i won't mind them staying here while i am away one bit. just need to boss-proof my flat now, de-clutter it, clean up extra well, tidy the desk and kitchen and prepare a "how to work my flat" guide and put together a some material to the city and the region. won't be too hard. and di already told me, that she'll frame evan's diplomas for me, free of charge in return. hooray! :)  today ran by again with gym, and this cleaning. - it's already past 6pm, and i am waiting for my deep conditioner to be done working. - feel the sudden, very intense urge to really pretty up for tonights reading. i am such a literature groupie, it's sickening. have always been: put a male being in front of me who writes books, and i get all weak in the knees. the excitement usually results in me making a total fool of myself in the end: has happened with bejamin von stuckrad barre, has happened at that previous seminar with andre eisermann, has happened with ralf rothmann, robert schneider and at the frankfurt bookfair. i rarely get starstruck with tv people, but with authours: all the time.  anyway. should be fun tonight, i hope. just need to keep my mouth shut when its my turn in the signature queue (even though i feel the urge to tell him that his show in berlin, 3 years ago, wasn't as terrible as he described him in his book).  off i go to wash out my conditioner. and please, no one ask about nanowrimo.

      today has passed me by, completely.  was quite reluctant to get going this morning - it was just too warm and cosy in my bed, and too grey, rainy and stormy outside. -a perfect day for fall coziness of the couply kind - if evan had been here, the ideal thing to do would have been to spend a good part of the day between the sheets with him (admittedly, not just because of the weather, but also because of my currently rather lively libido, which has to find relief with my gigolo for just 31 more days) and the rest of the day snuggling up in a cafe, cooking a decent dinner together and seeing a movie or so. miss him a lot today - partly because our phone contact has been a bit less frequent and extensive than usual - he's currently in merimbula, where there's no landline - and calling an aussie mobile is 11 times more expensive than calling an aussie landline. duh. but we'll manage with calls just every other day for another week, no doubt about it. we managed without calls for a lot longer while he was on bathurst island (nt) last year, after all. - it just makes me realize (yet again), how much more enjoyable my life is with input by him , preferably real life involvement,-  but even the phone call variety makes a difference. am so much looking forward to leaving next month - still a bit surreal that i will be back in australia already; considering how little has happened since i returned, and how little will (most likely) happen in the next 5 weeks, it hardly seems worth it that i bothered to return at all. can blame myself for it, of course - after all, i do little against my attitude that life over here sucks, and that all i have to do is get my matters straightened and then leave for good.  anyway.  once i managed to drag myself out into the world around noon today, i did some minor shopping and then  urlLink went to the gym, where i spend more than 2 hours sweating and getting through torturous exercises by visualising myself in a bikini . - felt excellent afterwards.  and that was my one achievement of the day, really. the afternoon just flew by over a late (and much needed) lunch, saturday arvo telly (dawsons's creek, which made me shudder in disgust about the negative attitude towards sex as presented in  urlLink today's episode  and family law. yes, i am a pathetic thing without a life.) and wasting time online, catching up with a few blogs i hadn't checked for ages. also need to write several long overdue email and spend some time at scarleteen. have been so bad at keeping online connections at the moment... also need to write a few thousand words for my novel - was quite unproductive both yesterday and today because the end of a relationship that i imagined has been quite difficult to put into words so that it makes some sort of sense. a very constructeded part of the story, but very much necessary so that that character can get a lifecrisis and come out of it improved. still haven't given up on my goal of 16.000 by tomorrow night, specifically before i leave the house to see  urlLink andre eisermann , which would be sort of 8pm-ish. quite a goal, indeed, considering i also want to spend another 2 hours at the gym in the morning.  late night writing session, here i come.

      this makes my ip-lawyer-to-be heart beat in excitement and anticipation.   urlLink law.com: judge favors bondage barbie :   Toy manufacturer Mattel Inc. is not entitled to summary judgment in a copyright infringement case against a British woman who sold sexually explicit dolls made with a Barbie doll product, a federal judge in New York judge has ruled.   Susanne Pitt, who operated the now-defunct www.dungeondolls.com, had offered for sale on the Web site a "dungeon doll" made partly of Mattel's SuperStar Barbie. SuperStar Barbie is an unadorned head sculpture based on Mattel's famous Barbie doll. Pitt allegedly attached a body of her own making to the SuperStar Barbie head and also used it in a sexual explicit story on her Web site.   (...)  The judge used one of Pitt's Dungeon Dolls that was purchased by Mattel's counsel to make her determination. The Dungeon Doll's dress, which Pitt described as "'Lederhosen-style' Bavarian bondage dress and a helmet in rubber with a PVC-mask and a waspie," convinced Swain that the product was sufficiently different in design from a typical Barbie-related toy.   (...)  "Defendant's 'touch-ups' of the dolls plus the setting she creates for them transform, to put it mildly, the original doll to an extent beyond merely supplanting it," Swain wrote. "A different analysis would apply if Defendant had, for example, dressed Barbie dolls in a different style of cheerleader outfit than those marketed by Mattel. To the Court's knowledge, there is no Mattel line of 'S&M' Barbie."  "Defendant's customizing appears to have evoked the image of Barbie while transforming the Barbie doll sufficiently that the quality and quantity of her copying weigh against a judgment as a matter of law in favor of Plaintiff," the decision stated. "It appears that there is slim to no likelihood that Dungeon Dolls would serve as a market substitute for Barbie dolls. The extent to which the context and character of the Dungeon Dolls transformed the unadorned Barbie head weighs against Plaintiff on the current record."    lederhosen style bavarian bondage dress? s&m barbie?  urlLink the nypost shows a picture . he.  what a funky thing to do in court, on both sides even. however, i have the duty to be partial to mattel ever since being admitted to their awesome showroom.... awww. i still long for the  urlLink "me so hungry" cookie monster .

       urlLink Friday Five    1. Did you vote in your last elections?   sure. i voted for german parliament on september 8th, 2002, about two weeks before the official election day, while sitting at evan's parents dinner table in melbourne. quite exciting, this absentee ballot thing, i loved it, even though voting was odd because i felt a bit out of touch with germany because i had missed out on all debates and the flood. from a legal point of view, my vote would have been invalid (had anyone noticed) because i wasn't alone when making my two crosses, and even took a photo of me and ballot. ooops! :)   2. Do you know who your elected representatives are?  sure. the member of parliament for my electoral district is  urlLink gernot erler , spd. he didn't get my vote, though.   3. Have you ever contacted an elected representative? If so, what was it about?  no. i have approached candidates up for (re-)elections though, while they were in the campaign trail downtown on weekends, mainly asking them what they were planning on supporting should they be elected and asking why i -as a young female voter- should support them.   4. Have you ever participated in a demonstration?  yes, but not that often. have demonstated against the the war against iraq (12 years ago), against neo-nazis and for university reform, longer opening hours of the university library and more funding. am not really one for demos, but currently feel the urge to show up at the airport when the foo fighters arrive in melbourne to protest their support of the aids dissident movement (who believe that hiv does not cause aids, and that people who die of aids/hiv actually die from the medication they receive. insanity.).   5. Have you ever volunteered in an election? What was the result?  nope.

      while cleaning out the cupboard under my sink i stumbled over the usual assortment of paper and plastic bags that inevitably keeps collecting in there. it happens every few months - no matter how often i remind myself to take along my backpack and a spare linen bag when grocery shopping and therby be a good responsible, earth-conscious german, i do forget, and hence need to buy (!) bags from time to time. that's why i keep them. i paid for them. good money, 15 - 30 cents, depending on shop, bag size and choice of paper or plastic. they are costly these things, and i should reuse them. and i do. which makes the bag collection under the sink quite unruly: there's almost spanking new bags (non reused) and reused ones with torn bottoms and the bags i just keep because, well just because. plastic bag memorabilia, how low can you go. i am a messy, and keep things. so shoot me, but i keep that one bag from lygon books, because lygon books ain't no more and because it was a lovely bookshop and because that friday night i was there 2 years ago to buy "once upon a collins st", there was a kid waiting behind the corner that reminded me of myself at my rents bookshop. and there's more overseas bags. duty free shop bags. a bag from the prague wax museum (not that i've ever been there). some myer bags that i wrapped my shoes in in my suitcase. two large bombers bags, from shopping for memorabilia at their shop at windy hill.   amongst the paper & plastic bag rubble was also a small crumply and partly torn green, black and yellow paper bag from lush in london. oh,  urlLink lush . i sniffed the bag, and sure, it still smelt like lush shops smell and like what i transported in it (butterballs, buffy the backside slayer, sympathy for the skin, silky underwear). quite a miracle, after being stacked in the cupboard under the sink for a few months. on further inspection (not that you can get much further inspecting a paper bag than sniffing it, i admit), i realised why i had kept that -admittely very crumply, torn, non-reusable bag.  it has lush's mission statement on it. under the headline "a lush life", they set out what they believe in. the first few paragraphs are pretty much what you'd expect. "we believe in...making fresh organic products by hand...without animal ingredients...we believe words like "fresh" and "organic" have honest meaning beyong marketing...yadayada." great. but not unexpected, correct? and then there's the second last paragraph.    "we believe in long candlelit baths, massage, filling the house with perfume and in the right to make mistakes, lose everything and start again."    what good-smelling smart people these lush folks are.  and now that i've preserved that smart statement, i can finally release that small crumply paper bag into the paper recycling bin.

      today, two people at the gym -independent from each other- approached and asked me how much weight i had lost, congratulated me on my success and told me i looked great.  odd, someone approaching someone else in the gym about progress. even more odd, considering that i haven't lost any weight and haven't worked out as much as i wanted (and needed) to lately.  strange. hmph.

      have been nanowrimo-ing like wildfire this afternoon. after 5 days of blankness, and inspiration hitting and characters finally talking to me yesterday, i have completed my draft, am well into my second chapter (if only 4.059 words into the 50.000) and am loving every single minute of it. once i manage my goal of more than 16.000 by sunday, i'll be on track word wise. should be doable, should my characters stay as interesting as they are.  it's amazingly entertaining, this stuff.  shared the details of the characters and the first chapters with tina, and she deemed it fun, too. and it is, how could it not especially for me, and her? there's a friendship in the novel (the two are the anchors of the rest of the story), and of course the two are a big mingle of tina and me in many ways. how could they not be? he.  can't wait to see whether my characters will behave the way i expect them to behave. oh, the excitement.

      i don't like this town much at the moment. i feel isolated, and all i can think about is leaving: how many  urlLink days, hours, seconds  until i get to board the cathay pacific flight to melbourne, whether things i purchase now will last until i prepare to head off, whether i will manage to be the shape i want to be in when i leave et al.  quite silly. i am well aware that i am making the now worse by being so focused on the future. very un-eckart tolle. there are things i need to do now, things i need to deal with now, appointments i should make and talks i should have, but all i think about is how to make time fly by, how to avoid people, how to make myself look good within the next 30 days, how to get to gym as often as possible, how to just get over the next 30-something days, and quickly and effectively and efficiently, too.  nanowrimo-ing is part of that avoidance and time wasting. while i am 5 days behind (no way to write while i was still with the parents) and will hence have to my novel "eclipse" at 2.000 words a day for the next 25 days, i am quite positive about it. what a way to waste time. perfect. quite odd to see my characters come to life: one minute ago, they weren't there, and now they've been pixellated into word, they are suddenly opening up and telling me about their past and present, and their wishes and who they've been to bed with. he. funky.

      i've been back for 11 days, and am still in the throes of jetlag. there hasn't been a night that i've slept through since i have returned, there hasn't been an evening, on which i haven't been dead tired and/or falling asleep in front of the telly by 9pm.  i don't think it has been this bad before. neither the jetlag, nor how much it quite simply hurts to be away from evan now.  i'm just not going to accept being back here. the more i am sure about where i want to be, where i want to live, the less i see the necessity to finish things up round here. bad, i know. not exactly a great motivator to finish uni.  it was just too good. everything was too good.  summer was great. the new house is great. the new town is great. his job & new colleagues seem great. christmas was different from what it's like here: there was cricket on the beach, a bbq with roos nearby, lots of family around, and terrible carols on the telly. merimbula was great, the atmo in the family unfortunately wasn't. - but most of that was sorted out afterwards.  overall, it was -despite lots of things that needed to be done- quite loungey: we just hung out, worked out (miraculously overcoming my competetiveness in the process), road tripped to warrnambool and back along the great ocean road, body-boarded every morning in merimbula, made love and deflowered almost every room in the new house, packed his stuff & moved to the new place, cooked meals, watched the cricket while drinking beers, quite simply enjoyed ourselves, spending time with each other.  and i miss him, miss what we had and what we will have, terribly.  sure. most of it was -yet again- a holiday, not real day-to-day living, but still. it was nice to simply have  time . it was nice to be there the first week he worked, to be all housewifey, to cook and prepare his place and make it home and be there when he came home after work. i felt so good, so at home in the house that it was unbearable to be there alone after i had to walk him to the hospital the day i left, before his terrible 14 hour shift started. walking back into the empty house, alone, being in his place knowing i wasn't going to see him for a few months, was terrible.  a few nights after i came back, i dreamt very vividly about evan and me talking on the phone. in my dream, we agreed how terrible it had been that i had to leave without him being able to say goodbye to me at the airport, and that we had to make up for it. somehow, we assumed that i was in melbourne, and we discussed what time i should come down the next day, what time he would finish work, what i would cook. - all the while thinking i was just a one hour train ride away. that whole dreamed conversation left me feeling very fuzzy and warm and protected and happy. - until, three quaters through the dream, we both simultaneously realised that i wasn't in melbourne, not just an hour away, but a day away, in europe again, unable to see him any time soon, unable to make it to his place in the time frame we had discussed. a devastating feeling. so devastating, i woke up sobbing.  and now i am back here, slowly getting used to being away from him again. not that that is something i  want  to get used to.

        urlLink friday five     1. as a child, who was your favorite superhero/heroine? why?  donald duck as fantomas. i felt sad for him, because daisy never realised his inner greatness. the usual superhero dilemma.   2. what was one thing you always wanted as a child but never got?  a pony.   3. what's the furthest from home you've been?  depends on the definition. christchurch, new zealand was about 18.700 km from the place i grew up. however, one might argue that home is where the heart is, which might mean that i am currently away from "home", a good 16.389km (now that he has moved to the coast, we're 20km closer).   4. what's one thing you've always wanted to learn but haven't yet?  playing the piano.   5. what are your plans for the weekend?  tonight, i will write some much needed, email, cook a yummy curry, watch  urlLink dirty dancing  on the telly. tomorrow & sunday, i will call evan early in the morning, practise yoga, do some weekend shopping, work out at the gym, talk to tina, watch german popidol, study, practise more yoga, work out more at the gym, go for a walk in the snow, continue reading "life of pi".

       urlLink a building complex designed by daniel libeskind will be built at the site of the former wtc.   which is fabulous.   urlLink daniel libeskind  is an amazing, unconvetional, unpredictable, emotional, daring architect. - the  urlLink jewish museum in berlin  is one of the most notable buildings i have ever seen, the impact it has through its form is breathtaking.  people in the press have called libeskind's designs "manipulative" because he aims to invoke certain emotions - but i love them. the wedge of light that will be at the site of the wtc providing space without shadow each september 11th is medieval and sacred in its effect.  it's a daring building complex that's going to become characteristic for the new new york skyline.

       urlLink so this was the last but one season finale, too.   for now though, no time to get sad: i am all excited about spike's soul and am already forgetting about the lows of the-season-that-never-had-a-real-plot-besides-buffy-and-spike-screwing. besides those nookie/fight scenes, and "once more with feeling", one of the best moments was giles return and him and buffy breaking into laughter as she told him what had happened since he left.  sometimes an end while still on top can be a good thing.

      i searched for my udo jürgens tape this afternoon and listened to  "ich weiss was ich will"  while doing the dishes. i ended up rewinding the tape several times, to listen to that song again and again, after noticing something odd.  it's bizarre: the song suddenly sparks mental images of evan and me dancing at our wedding. which you know, not only hasn't happened yet, but also isn't yet really planned. no questions have been popped (at least not for real & serious), there's no ring on my finger, even though i know that i want to spend my life with him.  this song is primarily mine, too. neither it nor udo jürgens  have a special meaning for us so far, -maybe apart from listening to "in den armen der nacht" on new years 99/00, at fabian's place, the night i first told evan that i loved him. "ich weiss was ich will" used to spark memories of my first months here, and now those have been replaced with this image of evan and me (in a simple, pretty dress, just for the record) dancing, surrounded by family and friends.  i realised that when/if that happens, i'd really like this song to be our first dance. it's german, unconventional for a first dance, happy, energetic, strong, full of promises and lust and fabulous remarks about sex no one would get because it's german. above all, it's about wanting to spend your life with someone you love and want and desire - and being secure about that feeling. we could swing dance, which would be so much more suitable for us than a traditional waltz.  i think i need to get my estrogen levels checked. what an extremely girly thing to think about.  but still, this mental image was and is a lovely one. *sigh*    ich weiss, was ich will  udo jürgens   dein haar weht im wind, von meinem fenster aus, da seh ich dich geh'n, du winkst herauf und bleibst sekundenlang steh'n. ich denk', wie schön war es doch eben noch hier,  mit dir.  ich weiss, was ich will, ich will dich fühlen, wenn der morgen erwacht, mit dir den tag verbringen bis in die nacht und glauben, nirgends ist ein ende in sicht, nein, für uns nicht.  ich weiss, was ich will, ich will die leidenschaft, mit der du mich liebst, die sanfte zärtlichkeit, wie du sie mir gibst, die illusion, du lebst allein nur für mich, die brauche ich.  ich weiss, was ich will, ich will, dass endlich etwas neues beginnt, dass wir wie ein gedanke, ein körper sind, das ist mein ziel, sag' mir nur eins: will ich zuviel?  ich weiss, was ich will, dir alles zeigen, was ich jemals geseh'n, was du auch immer tust, verzeih'n und versteh'n was ich noch nie vorher im leben getan, fang' ich jetzt an.  ich weiss, was ich will, ich will dich nie mehr aus den augen verlier'n, will deine hände sanft und weich auf mir spür'n, glauben daran, dass es auch so weitergeh'n kann.   noch kann ich dich seh'n, mit schnellem schritt gehst du die strasse entlang, mit deinem so vertrauten typischen gang. ich denk', wie schön war es doch eben noch hier, mit dir.  ich weiss, was ich will, an einem leeren strand allein mit dir sein, und alles tun, was man so tun kann zu zwei'n. und kein gedanke von uns bleibt ungesagt, nichts wird vertagt.  ich weiss, was ich will, wie ein zigeuner durch die welt mit dir zieh'n, dem ganzen irrsinn dieses daseins entflieh'n, und alles das, bis uns die sinne vergeh'n, wär das nicht schön?  ich weiss, was ich will, dass jede nacht für uns zum karneval wird und jeder weg nur zueinander uns führt. das ist mein ziel. sag' mir nur eins: will ich zuviel?  ich weiss, was ich will, ich will dich ganz und gar und immer um mich, was uns im wege steht, das ändere ich. ich hab' noch nie im leben berge versetzt, ich tu' es jetzt.

      did you know? there are side effects to buying a new telly and carrying it in all it's 10kg glory halfway through town to its new home.  this morning, getting dressed and admiring my stomach in the mirror (it looked like someone else's -all muscly and flat- yeah!), i noticed bruises on my stomach. big, painful bruises, located above my hip bones. i only realised they must have been caused by my pressing the big cardboard box containing the new telly very close to me while carrying it home, when i realised that both my upper arms are massively bruised (and i mean massively), too. that's what you get for trying to support weight you should be carrying with your arms alone with your hipbone, and for buying cheap tellys whose boxes come without handles.  yoga will be interestingly achy tomorrow.  ouch.

      my trusty old telly died yesterday.  yesterday being the day before the airing of the  urlLink season finale for buffy season 6  round here today. yes!  urlLink buffy!  essential television! absolutely essential television! i can barely live with missing an episode every once in a while, but not a season finale. yeah, i know what will happen, i know there will be the thread of yet another apocalypse, yeah spike will get a soul, yeah, yeah, yeah. but still. it's buffy! it's important!  my telly had been acting up this past week, making loud, aggressive  "phrewwwt"  like sounds when turning him on, a strange, burning plastic smell emerging, the image fluttering, at random, moving stripes disturbing my enjoyment of  urlLink the talented mr.ripley  sunday night.  he hadn't been in good condition for ages anyway. the remote broke years ago (i think shortly after his 10th birthday), and the replacement i bought worked in regards to changing channels and volume, but not in regards to reconfiguring channels. the buttons on the actual telly got all jammed sometime over the past two years or so, too. the connection plug for the cable had broken at the same time as the remote: the cable had to be supported by a book put up against it at all times - otherwise the cable just slipped out.  yesterday afternoon, when i turned my beloved little telly on to check whether george w. had already started bombing iraq, he uttered a final angry  "phrewwwwwwwwt"  (longer than ever before), threw out more smoke than ever before, flickered violently - and was dead. my knowledge on the internal setup of televisions is rather limited, so i have no idea what exactly happened and what gave him the final blow, but considering his medical history and the fact he didn't respond at all anymore, i decided even attempting to resuscitate him would be neither affordable nor actually make a lot of sense.  so i bought a  urlLink cheap little no-name telly  that i still couldn't really afford. but he's purty. he's shiny and silver. he doesn't smell like burning plastic. he doesn't flicker. he has got telly text. i can finally watch all 34 channels available via cable here (yay! two shopping channels! three french channels! a turkish sports channel!)  but best of all, i doubt there will be any terrible surprises and spontaenous implosions tonight after 21:15, when it counts. :)

      i still haven't explained what the mysterious email was, that i was so  urlLink worried  about  urlLink opening , two weeks ago.  it was from bjoern,  urlLink nils  brother.  i had emailed him earlier this month, something i had thought about doing ever since i  urlLink found out about nils death via his brother's website (and google) .  it had felt weird to write bjoern, nils' brother, because we have never met, but i wrote him a well-thought-through email, in essence very similar to what i wrote here, actually. i wrote about how i had met nils through d., what knowing him had been like for me, how we had lost touch, how i had come across the leaflet for the publishing house while cleaning up and had typed his name into google, how i had always expected to hear from him again and sit in a bar in st.pauli drinking red wine again one fine day. i expressed my condolences, how much it had hurt, and that i can not estimate how painful it must have been for the family. i thanked him for the website because knowing something is better than not knowing.  it was a good email that i wrote, but i still felt unsure and insecure about it, simply because i didn't want to pressure bjoern at all, my main objective was to make a connection to someone that knew nils and share the emotions.  bjoern's return email was fabulous.  he wrote that he was thankful that i had taken the time to contact him, that reading about my time with nils had brought back memories for him, that plenty of other friends of nils had done the same since the website was up, and that knowing how many people are missing nils is making it easier to live with the hole his death has torn into the lives of everyone who knew nils.  the only thing that startled me is what he wrote about d.: it gave me the impression that d. has not been in contact with nils' family and hence does not know that he is dead.  it's a strange feeling, being unsure whether d. knows, but i realised i am in no position to do anything about it and just got to live with it. it would be odd to ask nils brother whether d. knows about this, it would be even weirder to contact d. for the first time in months (6 months, specifically), and ask  "do you know whether nils is dead?"  or just strike up casual email conversation about nothing - when we did that in september (the first time in years), it failed quite miserably after one email each. - there is nothing left that d. and i have to talk about, and i quite honestly do not feel the need to talk about anything with him anyway. apart from this, maybe.  above all, i realised that it's none of my business to get involved in the friendship d. and nils had. i suspect it's quite likely that d. still thinks nils is living happily ever after on st.lucia, but what? they did have the on-and-off type of friendship happening after all, with weeks of intense contact followed by months with little, and who am i to get invovled here and step in and tell d. how bad and terminal loosing contact has been this time.  i know that in am no position to get involved here. but it still feels very weird.

       dinner   mixed salad (lollo rosso, lollo bianco, field salad, raddicio) with italian dressing, roasted seeds (soy, pumpkin, sunflower, pinenuts) and bacon bits, served with fresh ciabatta bread  penne rigate with tomato sauce, basil and real mozzarella   urlLink jamie oliver's chocolate mousse with sesame snaps    urlLink ernest & julio gallo twin valley cabernet sauvignon   am looking forward to having tina over for dinner tonight, not only because i really want to make an effort to continue our contact, but also because i enjoy cooking for others.  it's so much more worthwhile to cook for people besides plain old me. i love planning a meal, shopping, preparing, laying the table, - and of course the end result, serving, eating, talking over dinner, everything. such a social thing, sharing a meal.  didn't want to get too fancy today, and am not quite up to date with tina's likes and dislikes (she told me sauturday, that she doesn't like indian food, hence my initial idea of a curry was squashed), and plain pasta with mozzarella is safe, the salad a good, hearty green add-on, and the dessert the nice counterpoint in both taste and effort involved. it's absolutely delicious, that mousse - Ii only made half the recipe, but it's plenty. and it's very very yum - the alcohol, honey and the 75% lindt chocolate make all the difference, i think. unfortunately, the sesame snaps didn't turn out as expected though. the sugar syrup didn't go golden at all, but suddenly got all crumbly, cristally and dry (even though i really didn't overstir), and hastily throwing in the sesame didn't help much. the stuff tastes nice, but is neither golden, nor thin, nor bar-like: and most of it is just sesame-sugar crumble - if highly edible. some bits did stick together though, and will be served as directed. i will need to try again, i think. - i think something might be wrong with the recipe, actually: the recipe online has some extra butter (only mentioned in the ingredients list, not in the recipe), which my book doesn't. oh well. maybe it's time to send jamie another email.  in any way, i have no doubt tonight will be nice, crumbly sesame snaps or not.  :)

      this afternoon, waiting to be served at the bakery, tina came up to me. tina, my formerbestfriend.  we were best friends for about 3 years at the start of uni. we went to countless parties together (often preparing for hours in her flat), discussed boy woes, got drunk, failed and studied for classes together, slept in the same bed, watched ally mcbeal (back when it was still good), worked out... we were very extremely good friends, we had plenty of good times.  until she got a boyfriend, and i met evan, which happened in the span of 6 weeks or so.  some trouble evolved, surrounding both, and it turned out it had all been rather superficial - the friendship we had entertained, the friendships we, as a team, had kept with others, everything. when things got rough, my first serious bout of depression hit, and i decided to sever all superficial friendships, we lost touch. that was almost 3 years ago.  we haven't seen each other since then, which is quite strange in a town as small as this one. it can only be explained by how extreme and final my cut with her and my old friends was, and with the limits i have given my life since then. she returned some books via one of my neighbours, early on, i once wrote a letter telling her what was up. but that was that.  today, we ran into each other, completely unexpectedly (i thought she had left this city already) and we're meeting up to have a bottle or two of wine tomorrow night.  i was impressed by how lovely she was. i was searching for explanations, telling her how embarassed i was to get back in touch after a certain time had passed and she just told me she didn't need any explanations, i shouldn't be embarassed and it didn't matter. turns out, she's not done with uni either, which is a bummer, of course, but quite relieving for me, actually. - i am not alone, after all.  in any way, i will go and see her tomorrow, and in some way, it's like catching up with an ex-boyfriend. i am excited and worried and wondering what it will be like, and am anxious not to get too excited. i could do with a friend, and i loved our friendship when it lasted (the first time ever, i had a friend that close, i guess), but i don't want to re-introduce superficiality of that scale into my life, ever again, and am not sure whether i feel like talking about all that has been.  but i shall see.  no matter what, it's going to be a very interesting evening.

      i can't say often enough how much i enjoy reading  urlLink yoga journal  as an addition to what i learn from bettina and ralph in my courses.  it's reassuring to be able to reflect on their instructions with their insightful, extensive articles and advice pieces, and it gives me a sense of community i haven't found in class yet. - i've lately felt a bit like a freak, because the folks in both courses (apart from bettina and ralph, obviously) seem to see yoga primarily as a physical practise, aren't very interested in the rest and don't practise at home. also, the german magazine equivalent,  urlLink yoga aktuell , seems a bit less knowledgeable than yoga journal.  it puts me in an awkward position in class, being as enthusiastic as i am. thursday night, bettina asked whether anyone practised at home, and i was the only one who said yes, and also told her how difficult i found it to find a practise that fit my needs. i felt like i was  "showing off"  to the others, even though that was not my intention at all. i have turned to bettina after class to ask my big questions already anyway to avoid this. but still.  - it's similar with my flexibility, too: i am a bit hyper mobile, and can easily achieve plenty of asanas, especially the twists and bends. on thursday, the new girl in the group "complimented" on my flexibility and during some of my asanas (she was right next to me), and it made me uncomfortable and further pushed the feeling i was  "showing off"  and doing my asanas to impress others, which i am not. it's the way my body is, so what? it's not that great, anyway. being able to get into an asana isn't hard: it's the working on it, that is, and after all inflexible folks don't have to go very far too feel the intensity of an asana and to work on it, but i do. yeah, my head goes quite easily on my shins, so what? i still need bettina's help (by gently pressing my lower back 5mm further down) so i actually get to a point where i can work on the asana.  but what are my alternatives? pretending to not be able to achieve something would be silly and render being in class useless. and hiding what i feel about yoga, how strongly i feel about it, and how eager and willing i am to learn would be silly, too.  so the problems i have in life anyway, are invading my yoga practise, too. once again, i feel like i am "too much", too intense, too direct - a feeling that has been with me through the years. again i am embarrassed and almost ashamed by my body, even though this time it's standing out not because it's too big or too busty - it's too "good", too flexible.  it's something i will need to work on, not being embarrassed by my body, not being embarrassed by my eagerness. - i will not hide my love for yoga, and i will concentrate on how i do the asana, and not on anyone else. i will accept new girl's compliments happily (if they happen again, that is) and not worry about it, and maybe tell her that being inflexible is actually a lot easier. i will admire and be happy for everyone in class achieving the best asana they can do. - i noticed on thursday already, how happy i was for the dark haired gal to do such  a perfect headstand and masterfully controlled rise into it. quite amazing, how happy i can be for others. a lovely feeling.  i will get a chance to work on all this tomorrow already, am very much looking forward to my monthly extra saturday class.  in any way, i felt like noting two articles i read at yoga journal lately that both had some excellent messages i want to keep in mind.    urlLink everybody upside-down  "studying the yoga sutra and bhagavad gita will help you structure a yoga practice that is balanced and wise. practicing alone will help you purge the urge to perform your asanas for others and cultivate a deeper understanding of your body and its rhythms so that you can practice in ways that respond to your needs."   urlLink life without sex?  "what brahmacharya means is a deep clarity about sexual energy." (...) first and foremost, it means being aware of your own sexuality, being clear about your feelings and needs at every moment. i don't think one needs to be celibate in order to progress in yoga and spiritual practice, but i definitely think one has to be very careful and clear about the sexual choices one makes. you're not going to be a whole healthy person unless you're whole and healthy in your sexuality."  smart stuff, indeed.

       urlLink friday five    1. what is your most prized material possession?  my most beloved personal possession is my library: i have an extensive, much beloved book collection, that i will most definitely send down to australia in its entirety. my computer, or rather, it's harddisk, comes a close second. realised during  urlLink last year's motherboard death  and  urlLink the resulting data death scare , how much of my life is on this thing.    2. what item, that you currently own, have you had the longest?  my stuffed toy cat schnuffi. i've had him for more than 20 years - i got him as a pressie from my grandma after i lost my first stuffed toy cat, called klaas. back when i first got schnuff, i must have been in the middle of my oral phase: i still used a pacifier with holes, and throughoutly enjoyed using schnuffi's very soft ears to tickle my upper lip through the holes of the pacifier. i remember thinking that his ears were the softest thing in the entire world - a view i have changed since, but i still admire their softness, and tickling my face with them is still consoling. i and have slept just two nights without schnuffi since i got him. - he goes were i go, and has travelled extensively as a result. my beloved schnuffi isn't terribly pretty anymore - he's quite flat, from lying under me for about 8 hours a night for 20 years, and his fur has started to get quite fragile in places. my mom has stitched him up a few times already, but i fear he will need professional restoration, soon. people who have shared my bed have referred to schnuffi as "the dead cat" or "the ugly cat". these people do not share my bed anymore. if you love me, you have to love schnuffi. we're inseparable. so inseparable he travels in my hand luggage on planes, because i worry about him getting lost with my luggage. i'd be inconsolable if he were gone.   3. are you a packrat?  yes and no. i used to be a real, full blown messy and keep each and everything. i've tried to significantly tone done the unnecessary stuff that i own and simply get less stuff. it makes me feel a lot better, owing less stuff, and have started to realise that it doesn't make sense to accumulate fluff if i am leaving the country soon. it's been going ok, the toning down. - there are still a few boxes in my cellar that i can simply throw away, but i'll get around to doing that, sooner or later. i'm still learning and improving, after all.   4. do you prefer a spic-and-span clean house? or is some clutter necessary to avoid the appearance of a museum?  spic-and-span clean. it's a must. i've got an obsessive-compulsive personality, after all. which reminds me that my place is currently way too filthy for my comfort. - i have wanted to clean all week, and haven't gotten around to do it: will be a good way to spend tomorrow morning.   5. do the rooms in your house have a theme? or is it a mixture of knick-knacks here and there?  i live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment. if it had a thought out theme it would be "books, ikea and colour", as quite typical for a student's place. there's some stuff on "display" (real paintings, photos, souvenirs, what have you), but there's a serious underlying colour-scheme, and it shows: it's yellow-orange-red-pink, with an emphasis on the latter colours. even my dish towels, phone and my toilet paper fit into the colour scheme.

      i feel so much better. it's almost like i am a different person to whoever woke up this morning, headachy and bleary-eyed and down.  yoga rocked this afternoon. we did some more  urlLink salamba sirsasana , which was great and left me feel all empowered and strong. we also worked extensively on  urlLink adho mukha svanasana ,  urlLink salamba sarvangasana  and some backbends,  urlLink urdhva dhanurasana  being one of them. so amazing, that even simple poses like downward facing dog stay challenging, because you can keep working on and in them. such a never-ending path to walk.  after class, we all went for dinner at a chinese place next door, and i had the best asian food since returning: yummy noodles and rice and veges and tofu with interesting conversation with everyone else to boot. i told people i am emigrating though, and wonder whether that was smart or not. usually, it makes folks back off. i hope not these folks.  best however, was one of the pranayamas we did (whose sanskrit name i forgot, of course, the english aquivalent would be "bumblebee", i guess) - we all hummed on a very slow exhale while keeping our ears shut, and it sounded like my head and the room were full of harmony and dissonance and melodies caused by small, colourful flying insects (none of them yucky though). lovely.  the class is so nice, the yoga feels so good, ralph is so delicious to look at. it feels like i finally found rituals to do and things to say (or rather chant) that make me feel held and that just fit into it all.  wow.

      they make me feel raw, these talks about what to do, how to do it, how to afford it.  it being my move to australia.  combining love with money and a  urlLink governement organisation that isn't too excited about letting anyone into the country who is not a nurse, midwife, chef or radiology technician , is the perfect recipe for stress.  i know it, i am doing it. or rather: we are doing it.  evan and i, we had a close to 2 hour talk about the options today, and i still feel raw and open and my eyes are still red and swollen from the crying. it's pathetic. this should be a joyous thing, planning our future, but it isn't.  there are plenty of options, but they all come with their own set of downsides. all of them.  either it's too costly (there are actually several options that fit that criteria). or it means a whole year doing something that's not helping my career (but most likely harming it). or it scares him (but then, isn't it all scary anyway?). or it means being creative with visa restrictions (which makes me fear being extradited or not getting a partner visa when he finally feels ready for that). then there is an option which would involve staying here longer (which i really do not want).  it's so difficult to talk about it all without being hurt by his doubts and worries and concerns. i don't want to pressure him, want him to have space to say what he really thinks, but it's hard when i am thinking/planning to leave my country for *us* and he gets jitters about us moving in together. yet i can't do anything but accept his worries for what they are.  it's so difficult to decide what's best. it's such a lonely thing to do, this decision.  i feel like i will soon implode from the pressure.   (to top my day of, my last pack of timtams, which i turned to after hanging up the phone, turned out to be ruined by heat exposure. they are all covered with grey cocoa fat residue, and the choc is rough in the melt. fuck. someone send me timtams, please?)

       urlLink the age: here it is, conclusive proof against iraq   i especially liked the following reasons:   " #3  Our spy planes have photographed Saddam's deputy prime minister being driven in a motorcade of Mercedes cars. Mercedes is a German car, and Germany is in league with France to destroy America, like al-Qaeda. Therefore, etc.  (...)   #5  The motorcade was moving in an easterly direction through Baghdad. If you move in an easterly direction through France, you get to Germany.   #6  Saddam is another Hitler. Germany had a Hitler. Again, a direct link with al-Qaeda.   #7  Al-Qaeda operatives have recently been arrested in London. The Prime Minister of London, Tony Blair, then visited France for a meeting with Jacques Chirac. Chirac then visited Bonn to celebrate 40 years of his alliance with Gerhard Schroeder of Germany. Schroeder had a meeting with Putin of Russia, who then received Hans Blix, who went to Baghdad. Again, proof of a direct link."

      i constantly surround myself with noise, cds, mp3s, the telly. when it's silent, i get nervous and scared and start feeling locked up in my small space here. i always get myself so much noise that i keep forgetting that complete silence is an option, too. - especially on a sunday, when the shops are closed and the city is asleep.  i should enjoy the silence (fyi: demo-the singles 86>98, cd1, song #8) instead of being scared about how alone it makes me feel.  it's one reason why i find it so hard to find my way into daily home practise is the complete silence (apart from pranayama and some unwilling moans from holding and surrendering to certain asanas that is) and stillness both inside and out that comes from practising alone.  something else i need to work on, accepting and valueing silence.

      lately i have been thinking about getting tested to become registered as a potential bone marrow donor. i've been researching it, and was very surprised to read that one reason to be excluded is  urlLink depression that needs treatment .  i've contacted  urlLink my local donor registry  to confirm. while i could understand the exclusion of people with severe psychiatric illnesses, such as endogenous or severe depression and long-standing continuous treatment with psychotropic meds, i wonder whether i will be excluded because of my reactive, short-term depresion that was treated with meds for a grande 8 weeks.  that would be a loss. my bone marrow isn't depressed, it's happy and well and wants to help. i really hope i can get registered. hm. odd.

      last night, someone almost ruined my headstand induced high.  a guy followed me home from the tram.  to get to and from the gym, i catch a bus and a tram. during the day, it's a quick and easy journey, the buses and trams run practically all the time, between 5 and 10 minutes apart. late in the evening, such as after my yoga class thursday nights, it's a different story though: once my class is over, i have to hang around for half an hour before the bus arrives, and it takes another 25 minutes before i am home, including a few minute wait at a tram stop.  out of habit, when i am around alone in the evening, i make sure i carry my mobile. i make sure i don't look interesting, too, i cover up a lot. last night, i wore a big fat winter jacket, blunnies, two scarfes, a beanie that completely covered each and every blonde hair, no make-up. nonetheless, sitting on the tram for my final five minute tram ride home, i noticed that two guys sitting opposite me, a few rows away, were staring at me. i instantly got shitty vibes from them but kept trying to read my book, telling myself not to get overly freaked about nothing and to keep enjoying my post yoga bliss.  when the tram stopped at my tram stop, i did the usual thing to avoid being followed (a tactic developed when i lived in a dangerous suburb): i waited until everyone had gotten out before i stood up and moved to the doors to leave the tram. i left the car as the last person.  my waiting on the tram tactic didn't work this time, though.  one of the blokes i had noticed earlier stood in my way as i stepped out of the tram, and asked me -first in french, then in english- whether i "had a minute".  nice person that i am, i thought that i should at least give him the benefit of a doubt and see whether he was asking about the time or the way or something else. i replied in english that no, i didn't, but could i be of help? he asked me whether i had a minute, he and his friend would like to meet me, go somewhere for a drink, just for 10, 15 minutes or so. i said no, that i was not interested, tired, and on my way home. and i started walking. he walked next to me, telling me to stop, just for a minute, and i said again, that no, i wasn't interested. he kept repeating that he and his mate wanted to go for a drink somewhere, and i kept saying that no, i really wasn't interested, i was on my way home. he begged me to give him just a minute. so i indeed stopped, told him he had his minute.  instead of telling me something i didn't already know, he gave the same stupid talk about me going somewhere with his mate again. i told him off again, that no i indeed wasn't interested, had said so before, and that i was going home, and yes, i was going home without him. i started walking again, briskly, and decidedly. and this asshole grabbed my arm to make me stop.  he. grabbed. my. arm.  not firmly, not so much it hurt, but nonetheless, he touched me. a fucking stranger fucking touched me to stop me from going where i was wanting to go.  i should have slapped him, but i was so paralysed by that bullshit i couldn't even react.  instead, i said even more nos (yes, my conversation was that limited) and walked (or tried to, when he wasn't staynding in my way) but a fucked up "stop and go thing" evolved over the next few metres. he repeatedly asked again and again and again whether i wouldn't want to go anywhere, and started asking for other stuff (where did i come from? was i really going home?)  me repeatedly telling him (loudly at this point) no! and telling him I was being expected at home by my fiance. when i attempted to walk off, he kept standing in my way.  we had gotten to my street by then, and i started to feel panic rise inside my body, being extremely alarmed by the prospect of him finding out where i lived. where could i go now? what should i do? i wondered whether i should threaten that i'd scream if he didn't let me go, but realised that would have been a ridiculous thing. i finally told myself if i didn't get rid off this bloke within the next seconds, i would walk into the cafe next door to my house (still bustling at 10pm on a thursday night) and call the police.  thing is, i felt threatened by him blocking my way and all, i felt scared he would follow me into my house, yet it didn't feel "life threatening" yet. i had the impression that that idiot felt it was all just a fucking rotten game.  the bloke stopped me in front of that cafe, and i don't know why my 51st or whatever no finally had an impact, or whether it was that i was walking, and doing so briskly, and with my head up high, that he said goodbye and left. i walked home very briskly, turning around every few steps, worried he would find the other entrance to the backyard, but the guy was indeed walking away. once inside my house, i locked the downstairs door, which is usually never locked. i was freaked he'd be able to get in there and sit in front of my apartment door.  once i was inside my flat, and had locked my door a few times, i got angry. and that anger hasn't subsided, really.  had i done something wrong and sent that bloke wrong vibes that he felt he could just stand in my way and physically stop me from going my way? should i have just pretended that i didn't understand him in the first place and ignore him when i was in the vulnerable moment of stepping out of the tram? did i send out "victim vibes"? was something not clear about my communication? why the hell did i keep giving him reasons why i was going home? why didn't i feel like my no was enough already? lying about someone male waiting at home was good, but why did i feel the need to apologise for turning a bloke down who approached me at 10pm as i was getting out of a tram, after no flirty interaction whatsoever? was it his ethnicity that made me worry i was being racist if i didn't stop the first time he spoke to me and that sparked me to give him the minute he kept asking me for? was i overreacting and maybe just misreading and misinterpreting a harmless flirt?  this strange -if, thankfully, harmless and ultimately non violent- encounter left me shaking and worried. why did this male think he had a right to touch me after the unbelievable number of nos that i had said clearly and loudly into his face?  i think my language couldn't have been more clear. however, i know it's an issue that i compulsively smile when interacting, which some people understand as  "i say no but i mean yes"  thing. i need to turn that off, immediately, when on my way in the evening. i also need to carry my phone in a more accessible spot than the inside pocket of my jacket and i need to put the police hotline on speed dial.  but what should i do when and if someone approaches me in a similar fashion again? ignore them after a quick instant judgement based on ethnicity and gender? that would be very unlike me, this sexism and racism. i doubt it would improve my safety in any way, too. and wouldn't it be even more interesting for a bloke like that to try to communicate with me? the nos i said, even if they weren't accepted, were at least clear communication. but i worry. i am such a creature of habit, that it would be easy to find out for someone who was bad-meaning, what bus/tram i catch at what time, especially when there's little choice of transport left at night...   but what should i do? i really don't know.

       urlLink februarium, day five:  why you love.    i learned lessons on the hows and whys of love from reading and studying erich fromm's "the art of love".  fromm thought that many people make the mistake to love with a focus on themselves. they love only to be loved in return and make the mistake to see love as something that revolves around an "object". - people objectify themselves, for example by trying to be exceptionally powerful or beautiful to be loved (or rather: "admired") by others. fromm however, understood love as an art, as an ability. he saw love as the ability which frees people from the fear that arises from the seperatenes from others that life is, as the answer to the fundamental desire for unity and the union of the male and female energies of the universe.  the pillars of fromm's view on love were the following: love is unity, in which the partners still keep their own identities. love is the power with which people tear down borders and walls. fundamental for love is the act of giving, during which more love is created. love is the care for life and growth of who and what we love. love is responsibility. love is respect. love is acceptance. love stems from freedom.   and i like this view, this why of love, and try to live it. and boy, is it hard.  too often, jealousy, fear, doubt or selfishness get in the way of loving this way. -especially now, that something in me craves for assurance about the  "lonliest decision i will ever make" , my decision to move to another continent for love. nonetheless, it's something i am working on, to stand back, to compromise, to give without expecting something in return, to control less, to support more and to let evan be free.  it's frightening, this letting go, but i strongly believe that there is no other way than this one.      you owe me nothing in return  ~alanis morissette~  i'll give you countless amounts of out-right  acceptance if you want it. i will give you  encouragment to choose the path that you  want if you need it.  you can speak of anger and doubts, your fears and freak-outs and i'll hold it. you can share your so-called "shamefilled" accounts  of times in your life and i won't judge it.  and there are no strings attached to it.  you owe me nothing for giving the love that i give.  you owe me nothing for caring the way that i have. i give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege, and you owe me nothing in return.  you can ask for space for yourself  and only yourself and i'll grant it. you can ask for freedom as well or time to travel and you'll have it.  you can ask to live by yourself or love someone else and i'll support it. you can ask for anything you want,  anything at all and i'll understand it.  and there are no strings attached to it.  you owe me nothing for giving the love that i give.  you owe me nothing for caring the way that i have. i give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege, and you owe me nothing in return.  i bet you're wondering when the next payback shoe will eventually drop. i bet you're wondering when my  conditional police will force you to cough up. i bet you're wondering how far you  have now danced your way back into debt. this is the only kind of love  as i understand it that there really is.  you can express your deepest of thruths even if it means i'll lose you and i'll hear it. you can fall into the abyss on your way to your bliss, i'll empathize with. you can say that you'll have to skip town to chase your passion and i'll hear it.  you can leave and hit rock bottom have a mid-life chrisis and i'll hold it.  and there are no strings attached to it.  you owe me nothing for giving the love that i give.  you owe me nothing for caring the way that i have. i give you thanks for receiving, it's my privilege, and you owe me nothing in return.

       urlLink friday five    1. explain why you started to journal/blog.  i have been journaling since i could write. i remember getting a small pink and white journal with a plastic lock for my 6th birthday. i kept journals of many sorts througout my childhood and teens.  i started having an online journal in january 2000. back then, i was freshly in love and evan was on his way back to australia. triggered by an article on journalling online somewhere, i thought having something online just for him, a diary of sorts, would be a good way to communicate and keep in touch. i started a diary on the now very different opendiary. what was intended to be solely for evan took on a life of its own not long after it started, though. strangely enough, he never really felt good about reading what i wrote online. - while i gave him permission to read my online diary, actually reading it, he always felt like an intruder. also, he thinks my voice online is different from what i am like in real life (this being in english and all). his feelings about that haven't changed, but in general he doesn't mind me writing online, as long as some privacy remains.  i have journalled in one way or another for much of my life and am glad that i chronicled some rough times in my life. it's strange and interesting to read what i wrote at 16, and see someone who is very very different from me today. it's similar with what i wrote that first year i journalled online: i was very depressed, and a lot younger than i am today, and reading it, i feel sad for me back then. in general, writing online felt -and still feels, most of the time- a lot better to me than writing and whining for my harddrive. i guess it's just the general human urge to chronicle life at work here. it's difficult to put it into words: i still write for myself, but the semi-publicity this has, has helped me figure things out, too. i like the strange medium of a public journal, and can't really say why.  my writing online has changed over the years, and has changed with the publishing method i use, too. while at opendiary, i wrote long, whiny, sad journal type entries. since blogger, there's been lots more published, in smaller bits, with some blog typical stuff & linkage.    2. do people you interact with day to day or family members know about your journal/blog? why or why not?  i am not aware of real life people regularly reading this. my partner doesn't read my online stuff for aforementioned reasons, and tina only reads this occasionally, don't you? i have a sneaking suspicion my therapist might have searched it out. have you? my family doesn't know about this, because it is none of their business.   3. do you have a theme for your journal/blog?  as in a "motto"? i recently revamped a little and picked a new title for my diary/journal/blog/thing: "i defy gravity". it's derived from one of my favourite songs, "back to you" by melbourne band  urlLink something for kate :    for i have a compass i watch the sundial and i defy gravity just to get myself back to you

Whatever you feel, you'll know when it's happened: it explodes inside as bright and noisy as the Sydney New Year's Eve fireworks.    i've had the luck of more that one of these.  one that got under my skin is preserved on videotape, an unexpectedly intense kiss of totte and me on stage, him giving the audience the thumbs up behind my back.  another one that a lot tasted of red wine, and happened on a flatmate's bed, late at night. the next day, the hangover was terrible, but what was worse was my longing to repeat the experience.  my most favourite life changing kiss happened as i was sitting right here where i am sitting now, at my desk. there was tension (and anticipation) around, and evan came over from the bed and knelt next to me, telling me that i really didn't want to read the paper, did i? and i didn't, of course, and we kissed, in this awkward position, me sitting on a chair, him kneeling.  ...and then there are life changing kisses each and every time one of us walks out of those metal doors in the arrival section of an airport, when we're startled that the other one exists, after all, and is real.  i could do with some life changing kissing now, actually. :)

       urlLink februarium, day three: when you've loved   the first time i fell in love, for real, in my teens, i fell deep and hard and fast. it wasn't at first sight - i had known him for a while, casually.  you know the impact summer and being sequestered can have on the first sparkles of teenage love: it was the same for me. it was summer when i fell for totte, i had just turned 16, and we were both group leaders at a summer camp. as a bunch of friends, we were looking after a hundred kids aged between 8 and 14, staying at a gorgeous, 800 year old castle for three weeks.  i fell in love with totte, who was 19 then, because he was odd, smart, daring, creative. he was a performer, too, always out for an audience. and i was a willing one. i remember one night walking through the castle, passing his groups' bedroom. he was telling them a bedtime story about some obscure things (i specifically remember the invention of the dishwasher), making it up as he went. i sat down on the cold stone floor outside the room, and listened, too.  that butterfly feeling started quite abruptly, a few days into our first week. i was unable to pretend it wasn't there - i was so in awe of this boy, i couldn't keep my eyes off him. one night, after everyone had gone to sleep, sitting in oppsoite corners of a room, he told me had noticed it, and that yes, he liked me, too,  but didn't feel like he could include me in his complicated life. oh, the drama of it all. nonetheless, after a few hours of talking about that fact, he asked me whether i didn't want to come to his corner of the room, and of course i did. i think i didn't even bother to sit down on a chair, but sat on his lap straight away, and we kissed and tore some clothes of each other and spend that night clinging to each other. i fell asleep with my head in his lap, on a couple of chairs.  somehow, i thought he'd soon realise what he was missing out on and would change his mind.  oh, the folly of youth.  over the next few days and weeks, we started a stop-and-go affair straight out of a "how not to have a healthy relationship" guidebook. totte kept telling me (and i kept pretending that i understood) that we really couldn't have a relationship and really shouldn't be making out. - only to keep relapsing after drunken nights, trying hard not to let anyone else notice what was up (or rather "wrong") with us. he often literally ran away when things got wild. as if that all wasn't enough (imagine functioning & looking after kids with all that drama and no sleep) the mood at camp was further complicated by a friend of ours, stephan, getting so sick that he couldn't work anymore. as a result of that, totte and i ended up playing the leading roles in a silly little play we group leaders put on for the entire camp - we became prince and princess. that added hours of rehearsals (including a kissing scene) to the little dramas we played in (more or less privacy) most nights anyway. i longed for all of them.  the biggest drama came at the last night at camp. after lots of alcoholic beverages had been consumed, sparked by "our song" ("keine ist", bei rödelheim hartreim projekt), i confronted him in front of everyone else, screaming at him why he didn't realise that struggling against this was silly. he didn't respond, and i ran out of the room, into the boys showers, turning them on. i was fully dressed. he followed, of course, held me, took of his t-shirt as a towel substitute for me, and carried me to bed. had one of our friends not told him to leave me alone, it might have been different.  there are many "might have been's" in our story.  i get to think about what might have been..."   after returning from camp, we didn't see each other for a while, both going on seperate holidays, and totte was never there when we others caught up. once school started again, we started talking on the phone occasionally, and saw each other some mornings, when he had art classes at my school. i remember one day going to his place, and we took the bikes out to one of the hills, and "decided", sitting up there, we really wouldn't keep trying to have this relationship, only to end the talk hugging, me trying to kiss him again, unsuccessfully. that happened more than once.  then in august, something happened that turned everything upside down: stephan, our friend who had gotten sick at summer camp, died, suddenly and unexpectedly. he was buried on totte's birthday. in the weeks after, totte and i, we saw each other more often for a short while, we mourned together, we felt guilty together, we held on to each other, until it just stopped. after totte had been away on a trip to italy, he returned and told me one afternoon, again sitting in opposing corners of a room, that he had really wanted to sleep with me in the previous weeks and had hence avoided me, because he wanted to stick to the no-relationship rule "we" had established. we circled each other through the room, but nothing happened. i was just stunned by his admission. who knows how things would have been had i been daring, what might have been had i not let myself get circled around the room but had remained sitting where i sat, on the paint stained floor...another might have been, indeed.  a few weeks later, our dazzling stop-and-go affair would culminate in yet another drunken encounter which made me believe we would be a couple after all, but -un beknownst to me- once we had said our drunken goodnights, he had a major bike crash and when i visited him the next day in hospital, not only did he have a few big pieces of titanium in his shoulder, he also pretended not to remember our love-drunken banter and making out roughly 18 hours before. i was devastated and went to a different city for a week and on a (pretty successful) mission to snog totte out of my system - with rebound man. when i returned, totte had a girlfriend. that much to his life being  "to complicated to include anyone else" . thanks.  but alas, the story didn't end there.  despite the girlfriend, we had a final night of drama, in the city where i had just discovered rebound man, who was 9 years older than me, and an artist. we ended up drunk (oh, what a surprise), and he told me "we have to talk", so we went outside, to a nearby lake, and soon were all over each other again, after another bunch of confessions by him of the "i really love you/i wanted a relationship/i stood back because.." variety. however, the evening turned sour, because instead of loving tenderness, both of us -probably unconsiously knowing this was going to be the last time ever- got extremely aggressive and rough, not caring at the least whether anyone else witnessed him so obviosuly betraying his girlfriend with me. at one point, i was so exhausted, both mentally and physically, that i started to sob.  that morning, he was the first one up in the flat where we stayed with several people. he played sting's song "why should i cry for you" ( "Sometimes I see your face/the stars seem to lose their place/Why must I think of you?/Why must I?/Why should I?/Why should I cry for you?/Why would you want me to?/And what would it mean to say,/That, "I loved you in my fashion"?/What would be true?/Why should I?/Why should I cry for you?"  good question, if you ask me.)  it was the last time, ever. funny is that thorsten thinks -to this day, actually- that we had intercourse that night, which we just didn't. even more funny that he -also to this day- feels sorry and guilty about it. as the final postscript to it, a few days after this last encounter with totte, i found myself sitting in a cafe with his girlfriend, "talking things over". it was a ridiculous thing, because i just didn't want him anymore then anyway. at all. sometime during that last night, i had fallen out of love with him.  the next year, going back to summer camp, still with rebound guy (he and i, we had a great relationship, actually), i still felt a terrible urge to please totte, to live up to his standards. i was still his willing audience. he was my willing audience, too: he walked in on me and someone else having a one night stand (not that we noticed it then), and instead of you know, walking out and never mentioning it, he came into my room at night and wrote "hahahahaha" on the skin of the inside of my arm with a waterproof marker. thank you very much.  we lost touch after that second summer.  i ran into him on a train once, a few years later, and in the summer of 2000, i saw him again, at the castle, and was his willing audience again. this time, he stunned me though. he apologised for how bad our relationship had been, told me that he had wanted to do that for years, that he wished he hadn't run away from himself then, that he wished i had been more daring, because he would have needed that. we talked about lots of things that might have been.  while they upset me a lot then, and paralysed me for weeks, these things that might have been, these days, i don't ponder anymore how different life might have been had my first love been actually loving, and not this kind of a stop-and-go-affair.  i can still see why i loved totte, why i loved him with the fervor of a 16 year old, why i clung to the feeling and let him hurt me. he still amazes me,  urlLink i still look out for him and care about what he does , if only from afar, i still find him awfully attractive, as creative and daring and spontanous as i thought he was at the start. i am still not completely over him, sometimes. our thing was intense and dramatic. - i didn't know better about what relationships should be like. i didn't know that ideally, both people are equal partners - and not performer and audience. not only did i feel love in all its intensity that summer, i also learned through this relationship what i didn't want.  and that's something, too.       flinch  ~alanis morisette~  What's it been over a decade? It still smarts like it was four minutes ago We only influenced each other totally We only bruised each other even more so  What are you my blood? You touch me like you are my blood What are you my dad? You affect me like you are my dad  How long can a girl be shackled to you How long before my dignity is reclaimed How long can a girl stay haunted by you Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name  Where've you been? I heard you moved to my city My brother saw you somewhere downtown I'd be paralyzed if I ran into you My tongue would seize up if we were to meet again  What are you my god? You touch me like you are my god What are you my twin? You affect me like you are my twin  How long can a girl be tortured by you? How long before my dignity is reclaimed And how long can a girl be haunted by you Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name Soon I'll grow up and I won't even flinch at your name  So here I am one room away from where I know you're standing A well-intentioned man told me you just walked in This man knows not of how this information has affected me But he knows the colour of the car I just drove away in  What are you my kin? You touch me like you are my kin What are you my air? You affect me like you are my air

        urlLink the guardian: bin laden offers tips to defend iraq  "Al-Jazeera, the Arab satellite channel that specialises in Osama bin Laden scoops, was itself scooped yesterday by the US secretary of state, Colin Powell. When Mr Powell announced that the station would shortly broadcast a new tape from the al-Qaida leader, executives at the TV studio in Qatar appeared flummoxed. The editor at first denied it and the press spokesman declined to comment.  But Mr Powell's prediction came true. The 16-minute audio tape - purportedly the ninth recording from al-Qaida received by al-Jazeera since the start of the Afghan war - arrived in the studio just after 7pm London time. It came "in a similar way" to others, according to a spokesman, Jihad Ballout. [...] So perhaps Bin Laden has scored an own goal. Or perhaps it is not the voice of the al-Qaida leader at all.  Could it simply be an actor, hired by the CIA, addressing the world from Langley, Virginia?   The trouble with Bin Laden tapes is that nobody can ever be quite sure."   indeed, i, too, wonder, how colin powell knew about the tape before al-jazeera did and am more than amazed someone actually wrote in a paper what my first idea was. what a strange world this one is.

      i had my first yoga class with ralph today.   it was really nice, and i think i have decided that i will join it on a regular basis. ralph is a really nice guy, probably not even 30, and i like his teaching, even though it is different from bettina's. - he's more demanding, i'd say, and corrects in a different way, too.  he doesn't teach traditional sivananda per se, he combines it with elements of yvengar and ashtanga, and it makes for a good combo in a way, today's class felt "whole", if that makes sense. he does include some chanting and explanations when appropriate and uses the orginal names almost exclusively, which is all very nice.  om.  the class is small, and the other people are young and friendly. - and they are all very advanced and very flexible and very strong. it will be good to put my  urlLink resolutions  to the test: it will be a lesson in humbleness for me, to be the least knowledgeable and the most struggling person in a class.  and finally: if i really wanted to, i could quite easily get myself a major crush on ralph. he's super friendly, knowledgable, young and lean and muscluar (very yogic, indeed), and has the nicest little happy trail on his stomach. oy. :)

       urlLink februarium, day one:  who you love.  (a day too late)  dear evan, when i saw you for the first time on platform #3 of freiburg train station (i had been running late to pick you up) that december evening more than three years ago, my first impression was that you were "just another typical aussie from the exchange". i'm still sorry for that: it must have been the big jacket and beanie and backpack distracting me from the person underneath the winter & backpacking garb. but then, you thought i looked just like ellen, which i quite simply don't do. we're even on how off we were with the first impressions, aren't we?  within hours of your arrival, i realised that you were different to anyone i had ever met before. sitting at cafe legere with you, i felt that you and i, we were extremely similar and had lots in common, i felt like a recognised you. butterflies started to rage in my stomach and i kept telling myself that no, i shouldn't misinterpret the comfortable talking and the opinions we shared and should better not start harvesting romantic emotions for someone who i not only had to work with for the next few weeks, but who also -quite literally- lived at the other end of the world but alas, both you and i know what happened next.  it's amazing to realize that it's been more than three years since we met.  we have changed in those three years, our relationship has changed. those first few months apart, after those first few weeks of bliss (and you leaving jen) were terrible. if i look back at us then, it's like seeing two people doing everything wrong one can do wrong about ldrs. it makes me very sad to think how depressed i got through those first months, through jen being constantly around while you didn't take a firm position to her. it's embarrassing to realise that i pressured you that much, just like you're embarrassed about how much ego-cuddling by other people you needed back than, and how you let other people's emotions and needs override yours, and how badly you treated me.  we've both grown and learned and improved so much since.  i still can't quite say when the change happened, when we finally got on the route to a better relationship. - i remember us argueing at cologne train station in the first week of 2001, when it felt like we were either going to get through or break up. so severe were my issues with you needing others for your self-esteem. it's been hard to see you, intelligent, beautiful, smart, talented, sexy, loving, being so unsure about yourself. it made me feel like something about me was wrong, when you needed other people's praise.   since then, things have improved constantly, our time together now bliss- and not stress-filled. sure, there are still bumps in the road (and they are plentiful), but you and i are the team we were the first weeks we met, sharing so many things we both enjoy: music, cooking, working out, watching sports, roadtripping. the more time i spend with you, the more i know i want to be with you, and that the place where i should be is with you.  while our time together has grown better, saying goodbye to and being apart from you has grown harder. i remember us thinking we'd get some sort of routine to saying goodbye over time, but really, the more i know i want to be in melbourne, with you, the harder it is to get on the plane back here. it seems so pointless to clear my life up here, when i can not wait to start living with you. - the glimpses of coupled life together we've had so far were so good, made me so happy.  being with you not only makes me feel safe and loved and secure, but it also challenges me. challenges me to let go of those obsessive compulsive streaks i have, challenges me to care less about some and more about other things.  but above all, being with you feels right. i miss being with you, sleeping next to you; i miss your hands on me, i miss touching your hipbone (which has been mine, since the first time we got naked), i miss kissing you, tasting you, spending an afternoon being under and above and surrounded by you, i miss sitting on the rim of the bathtub, watching you shave, or looking at you while you're in the shower, making poses for me. i miss cooking with you, making coffee for you in the morning and quitely having breakfast sharing the paper, i miss walking and talking, driving around in your mg, i miss our conversations, i miss how you challenge me mentally, and how we're able to discuss so many things.  this year is going to be adventurous: so many changes, your new job, my graduation, my impending move. - i am sure if we don't loose sight of the team that we are, we will manage it, just fine.  it's a great adventure to be your partner and i can't wait until we have this all year round, and not just in short bursts.  i love you.  caro

      i had a personal training session and  urlLink program show at the gym today . i thought we'd do assessment, too, but thankfully, stephan, one of my gym's personal trainers, didn't get out the dreaded body fat scales. i can't say that i mind. - i was so worried about stepping on them, i fasted last night and this morning and had little water (which can upset the results). sure, it would be good to know. - the last measurement i have is from 15 months ago, and was very very bad. i am sure i've improved since then.  maybe i'll actually ask for the dreaded scales at our next session in twelve weeks. oh well.  anyway. got lots of praise on my progress from stephan (and again from chris, gee, she's been doing that every week lately) and now have a real grown-up, advanced, split weight training program. including free weights, so that i will get to spend time in the testosterone laden corner of the gym with the muscly, moaning boys. weeh! am now officially giving up all classes besides body pump and reebok step - and maybe the occasional fit-plus class (mainly because i like bettina and because it adds different moves and activities, the classes most of the time aren't quite challenging enough for me) or a spinning session. no more bodystyling! weeh!  yes, i know, there is life outside gyms, and yes, my life is very boring, considering how excited i am about this.

      at the gym this morning, in the bodystyling class i took part in, one of the women around me smelt like airplane moisturiser.  moisturising lotion from airplanes. you know, that free, strongly smelling, either pinkish or off-white moisturising lotion that's in the bottles without screw-tops on economy class toilets on long-haul flights. you know, that stuff you only use when you've forgot to pack your own moisturiser in your hand luggage. you know, that stuff that smells so strongly that the entire toilets smell like it, too.  cathay pretends that what's in their little bottles is actually kanebo. but i doubt it. it has none of the traits of a good quality moisturiser, and that smell is so not kanebo, either. i personally suspect that airplane moisturiser comes from a 250 l barrel labeled "airplane moisturising lotion with built-in toilet air freshener" that is delivered with the airplane, straight from boeing ( buy one airplane, get two barrels of airplane lotion, free. choice of pink or white variety. ), accompanied by 8 little screw-top less bottles (one for each economy class loo) and an assortment of stick-on labels so the airline can disguise the origin of the lotion and pretend that it's high quality.  what else could explain how air new zealand, singapore and cathay all had lotion that smelled the same?  oh well.  so this morning, i worked out for an hour, a cloud of airplane lotion moving around the room. the smell breathtaking, giving me flashbacks of being cranky and tired, of dry air, dry skin, and queing for the loo, of leaving australia, of missing my boy. duh. unfortunately, i was unable to identify the culpit, the cloud was just too big, and surrounded a group of at least 6 women.  i wish bodystyling class came with a no smell, no perfume, no nothing rule, like yoga does.  just to prevent sad airplane travel flashbacks early on a sunday morning.

       my watch still shows melbourne time.  i just haven't really felt the need to change it to central european time yet. i dont want to. changing it would be like accepting that i am back. in the past, i sometimes changed my watch while still on the plane, or when on the train back home. not this time.  i can't and i don't want to.  it started on the plane. on the the way to hong kong i kept looking at it, thinking about my lover working, having a terrible day at the hospital. i kept hoping the patient who was pretty much dying when evan came in at 8am was still better again and that evan's day wasn't as horrible as it had started out. when my watch showed 10pm, i thought about him finally being able to go home, walking along swanston street, turning into malop street, crossing through the park where the mad magpie always ogled us in the mornings and being home shortly thereafter. i imagined him unlocking the door, dropping his bag and kicking off his shoes. i imagined him getting beer from the fridge, walking upstairs and finding the note i had left, and my photo back on the nightstand and the freshly made bed (to avoid him being sad because of  urlLink sheet changing, which is as sad as showering ). i got sad thinking about him being alone in the room, his first night there alone.  later, in hong kong, walking around the airport in a daze, i kept looking at my watch and knew evan was asleep in his bed now, i knew what his sheets looked and smelled like, i imagined him lying there, his bear in the top right corner of the bed next to him, and i missed him, longed to be there and snuggle up to him from behind.  i still look at my watch and wonder what evan is doing. i try to imagine what his life is like that very moment. it connects us, my watch that is still showing melbourne time.  every night between 9 and 10 my time, i look at my watch and think about him starting his day. i imagine him sitting in the kitchen reading  urlLink the age  and reluctantly having breakfast and coffee, his flatmate susie jumping around, hecticly ironing a blouse for the day. i see him picking out a shirt and tie for the day, fixing his hair in the bathroom and sorting and picking up the things he needs from the nightstand (mobile, pass for the hospital, keys, change). close to 10pm my time, i imagine him and his flatmates walking through the park with the magpie towards the hospital, passing the rose garden, once they've arrived at the hospital walking up the driveway to the resident's quaters. every morning, i send him an sms that time of the day to say good morning and wish him a good day.  when i wake up in the middle of the night, still struggling with jetlag, and see that it's just past noon in his town and timezone, i wonder whether he has got time to grab some lunch now and whether he's at the funky cafe down the road with some of the other interns. i wonder what stuffed toy is sitting on their table - there are no numbers for orders at this cafe, you get a stuffed toy instead. is it freddo this time or the purple dragon?  every morning when i wake up and my watch shows that it's 5pm where he is, i think about him still being at work, having one more hour to go, and wonder what he's doing, whether he's seeing patients, or dealing with any codes, or sitting somewhere writing discharge summaries, or maybe even playing ping-pong in resis, when there's nothing to do.  i am well aware that quite often, my guessing is off.  that he's got the afternoon off and is getting his hair cut or working out when i wonder about him looking after patients, that i think about him getting up, when he's been up for ages already, that he's super busy on a day when i hope he's got spare time.  but i don't mind being wrong at all. this is not about accuracy - it's about feeling a connection.  and i do feel a connection. i feel it right now, looking at my watch showing 4am, imagining him in his bed (knowing which sheets are on, imagining him wearing certain shorts, his old ragged "swot-cool for cats" t-shirt next to the bed on the floor because he was too warm), the blinds on the window down, his mobile blinking and flashing every few seconds in the corner where the powerpoint is. i still wish i was there.  but looking at my watch, i am there.  i can see him and smell him and crawl over him to the wall side of the bed, lift the duvet and snuggle up to him, putting my arm around and my hand on his stomach.  in my mind, i am there.

       nothing can improve my day as significantly as a relaxed one hour phone call with evan after a week like this one.  we finally had time to connect and exchange stuff that had been happening and just hear each other's voices. an hour of coupley-ness that was very much needed on my part. all very nice indeed. left me feeling a lot happier about us than i had been all week, and probably the week before that, too. re-charged my love batteries so to speak. he. unfortunately, it also left me longing to be with him, my poor boy all alone at home on a friday night before a work-filled weekend, too tired to be bothered to cook a real meal for himself.  i really want to improve our connection, which gets so disturbed by the noise of my worries and my self-doubts and my feelings of worthlessness, and work on being a reliable, supportive, loving companion and lover for him. it's all there already, i felt it today again (talking about our parents, and pleasing them, and my fathers hate of my impending leaving) -  i just forget what we already have, what we have had for such a long time already, when my thougths turn negative.  after yesterday's yoga class and meditation, i decided to look for mediations that might help me working with my worries, or rather, accepting them and letting them move through me, to get somewhere better. the simple images that bettina has been using during our meditations after class, warm suns over our chests, love and warmth radiating through us to those we love (which stirred up images in my head of my love crossing the globe like radiowaves, finding evan at sleep in his bed at night) have made me feel so good, that i thought it might be worth a try to find inspirational or meditative reading to use before or during my sitting. found even more than what i was hoping for:  urlLink the power of love meditation  at  urlLink yoga journal . am very much looking forward to do it after my practise tomorrow morning.  :)

       urlLink friday five .   1. what did you have for breakfast this morning? if you didn't have breakfast, why not?   i am having a choc flavoured protein shake as i type. very late brekkie, but i felt a bit sick last night after yoga, and didn't feel like eating earlier today. when i am done with the shake, i'll have a banana, too.   2. what's your favorite cereal?  uncle toby's bran plus with  urlLink yoplait no-fat vanilla yoghurt .   3. how often do you eat out? do you want that to change?  i don't eat out when i am here at all. i hate eating out alone, and quite simply can not afford it since we had the , when eating out suddenly turned into a major luxury because even a plain pizza sets you back 5  already.   4. what do you plan on having for dinner tonight? got a recipe for that?  it looks like i'll either make potato soup or broccoli pasta with pork bits, depending if and what i feel like after my spinning class tonight (often don't feel like cooking and/or eating after working out in the evening).   broccoli pasta with pork bits   serves one lonely me   80 g spaghetti 250 g broccoli, washed, and cut into bite sized morsels 1 shallot, chopped 1 tablespoon olive oill 100 ml prepared veggie stock salt and black pepper a tiny bit of lemon zest 50 g rolled, smoked and cured loin of pork, fat-free, chopped 1 tablespoon cream     cook pasta al dente.  while pasta is cooking, heat oil in a non-stick pan, and fry the chopped shallot and the broccoli for thee minutes, stirring constantly.  add the stock, and salt, pepper and lemon zest. simmer for a further 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.  when the pasta is done, drain, and transfer into the pan with the broccoli. add the chopped pork bits and the cream, and mix well.  arrange on a deep plate, sprinkled with black pepper.     potato soup    serves one lonely me several times, or two to three very hungry people about once    about 5 medium sized potatoes peeled and cubed; preferably a firm potato variety 700ml fat free milk 250ml prepared veggie stock 1 medium sized onion, chopped ½ teaspoon celery salt 1 teaspoon herb salt 100ml creamy fat free yoghurt parsley, chopped     put milk, stock, potato, onion, celery salt and herb salt in a pot. bring to cook. once boiling, reduce heat to very low and let simmer, stirring regularly, until the potatoes are through. remove from heat.  put half of the potatoes and soup into a mixer and puree until smooth. transfer back into pot and stir until even.  serve with a dollop of yoghurt stirred in, and sprinkled with parsley.  if you want more oomph and transform this into an even more filling stew, just add chopped up, steamed veges of your liking. to transform this into a spinach soup, use fewer potatoes, and add a handful of chopped spinach (squeeze out excess liquid) and a bit of lemon juice.     5. what's your favorite restaurant? why?  i don't really have one over here, because i hardly ever eat out. in melbourne, however, there are a few places i like a lot. above all is fletcher's pasta bar in 87 fletcher st, essendon. they serve trusty, yummy pastas and awesome desserts in a cosy, family-like and friendly atmosphere. - and you get to spot  urlLink bombers  there, too! i also like a small asian joint on russel st, whose name i don't know, and an assortment of places on and around brunswick & smith st.

        Why do women love Spike? Well, it's obvious - tough but sensitive, Spike is the perfect fantasy object. Asked for his thoughts on Spike's appeal, Marsters laughs and says, "In the words of Sid Vicious," he adopts a slurred British accent, "girls love me 'cause I've got a nice face and a good figure."     urlLink the age: masters class   yum.

      question of the day: what's that deal about snow being romantic?  after a good week of pretty much constant snow, i start to believe that snow is just very slowly, frequently direction changing (making sure to always be directed into your face) falling rain that clings to your clothing. the cold (which is essential for snow) makes sure your soaked through clothing actually freezes.  duh.

      i quite gloriously failed at sticking to my  urlLink freshly written resolutions  today.  just after noon, after i came home from the gym, i called evan, because we had agreed yesterday that we'd talk today, just after ten his time. but no one answered at home. he didn't answer his mobile. rather frustrating. in an instant, a zillion images flashed through my head, all of them rather sickening, most revolving around variations of "he's out at nash with his new flatmate, seeing my symbol flashing on his mobile and deciding not to answer". i did leave a message on his mobile, during which i sounded as unnerved as i was by not being able to get in touch with him. oops. felt bad about that message as soon as i put down the receiver, but was upset nonetheless, because it's been such a trial to talk to him for more than 10 minutes all last week.  after an hour of being upset and obsessing about what he might be doing away from home, i started to get upset about being so distrusting and started to worry that he might have had an accident, that he had swapped shifts and was actually working, or that he had just missed the call because he'd been in the shower and didn't check is mobile before going to bed.  all very stupid.  just after 2, my phone rang, and of course it was him, worried about me being angry because of the message i had left. indeed, he had spend the evening at nash, and for the first time in days, he wasn't completely tired and in a good mood, too, because the day and the evening had been good.  it was good to hear him happy and well and happy about getting along with his new registrar. how mean of me to be jealous of him spending time at the pub, when he works so much and really needs time off to socialise with all the new folks around.  argh.  but of course all was well, and we joked a bit, even though (as with many jokes) there was a grain of truth in my joking that he should send over the addresses of all the girls around, so i could send them the membership cards for the "evan fanclub" and to tell me more about having two female flatmates, a new female registrar all other male interns fancied and looking especially good at the moment, so that i could spend the rest of the day curled up in a fetal position.  duh.  he also told me how worried he was about the phone bill and that he hadn't had time yet to check calling rates, which was why our calls had been so short lately.  in any way, i failed today. completely. well done, caro.  i reckon part of my *issues* with phones stems from seeing my brother utilizing modern technology to repeatedly cheat on his girlfriend. he's a master of sneaking out for secret little mobile calls, making up stories about where he is, and turning off the phone when he's with someone else. when i visited him in london in july, he spend a night away from the flat (with affairgirl #354), and i -staying alone at his flar- got orders to not answer the landline, just in case his girlfriend called. it's unfair to transfer my brother's cheating behaviour to evan. very unfair. but i keep having trouble turning off the freaking out about phones.  silly me.  i vow to be better about being an attentive, loving, caring, understanding girlfriend tomorrow.

      i am well aware that 2003 is already a month old, but considering i've been on a mission to consolidate life, writing down some goals & wishes seems like a good step. who cares about being late?   {resolutions}    {physical}  i want to look after myself better and keep having a healthy, active lifestyle - all year round. this is two-fold, it involves both better nutrition and working out. i will make an effort to eat more regularly and higher quality food, especially more (and new) veges. regarding working out, i want to keep improving both stamina, strength and flexibility. i will seek assistance and guidance in setting a new routine for me. i will attempt to not let the scale or my body fat percentage rule my happiness. i want to feel loving feelings for my body. i will keep donating blood and get regular check ups.   {mental}  i will make an effort to use therapy to its fullest potential, attend regular sessions, and be honest with my therapist. i will work on my relationship with my parents and attempt to stop avoiding the rough stuff. i want to built more self-esteem and self-worth, and let go of some of the obsessive compulsive streaks of my personality. i want to get over my anxieties and helplessness. i want to recognize the warning signs of my depression, and ask for help when it gets rough. i will keep practising yoga, and find a new teacher, to get more regular practise. i want to nurture the few friendships that i have, and meet more people. i want and need to built a strong support net for myself again, as i can not and should not rely on my relationship alone. i want to be less judgmental in contact with other people, especially women, and try to actually get to know *them*. my goal is to turn off the voice of the beauty myth in my head.   {relationship}  it's gonna be a year of big changes for evan and me. these changes scare me a lot. - i want try to trust in us more and relax more, and want us both to continue being a team. i want us to start making real, definite plans together and decide together on the best way for me to immigrate. i want to be more open towards him, without fearing rejection. i want to stop comparing myself to women who are closer to evan, and trust in his love of me. i will try to not start doubting him and us as soon as there is a bump in the road. - my worries, expectations and self-doubts poison our relationship. i want to continue being there for evan and find a balance between both our needs and wants, and let go of my position more often. i want to be patient and helpful in this time of change for evan, and keep listening to his needs. my most immediate goal is to improve our communication while apart, and find a communication schedule that fits both of us.   {educational}  i want to finally finish my law degree this year, and move on. i want to keep a strong connection to my melbourne law firm to secure a job for next year, and decide on a university and course (and how to pay for it).   {financial}  i want to start being in control of my money issues.  this includes actually having a real budget and paying bills as they turn up. it also involves attempting to start saving, and looking into ways to finance my move & continueing education.  in short: i want to be a better person.

      i think dr.k, my dear therapist, thinks that i have an eating disorder.  i had my first session with him in ages today, and when i mentioned going to the gym with evan when in australia (and how his going with the new flatmate felt like she was trespassing in my territory), he asked me whether i went over here, too. i asked him why he wanted to know, to which he replied that i looked like i had lost a lot of weight.  he said it in a very non-judgmental, neutral way, i.e. not the way my mother says  " wow, you look so good! so skinny!" .  i told him i didn't know how much i lost (even though i do know exactly how much it is) because i didn't own scales (which is true). he asked me, why i didn't own scales, to which i told him (truthfully), that i don't want the scale to rule my life. i should have used the moment and should have been more honest and open. i should have told him that even though  i  don't have scales, the gym does, and my parents do, and i do know exactly how much i weigh and that it does feel like the scales are gaining control over me again. i could have told him that it sometimes feels just a tiny little bit out of control. how hard it is to decide what to eat and how much time i *do* spend at the gym.  alas, i didn't.  lying to my therapist the first session i am there again, is quite a stupid thing to do, indeed.  thing is, it sounds so *made up* for me to say that i feel like something might be wrong, or might be on the way to turning wrong. it sounds *made up* to speak about my silly eating habits and the rules that i follow and how much i work out. talking about it feels fake, like i *want* to have an eating disorder, just so that i have anyother psychiatry issue i can claim as my own. it sounds like i want a playmate for my ocd and depression. the two are so lonely. fact is, i know all about eating disorders, i should know how to avoid the slippery slope.  hm.  maybe i should bring it up again, and simply be honest about it next week.

      i've lost my body.  somewhere between melbourne, hong kong and frankfurt, it has dissapeared, and i haven't managed to find it again. it's still there, obviously, but her and i, we've been disconnected.  these last two weeks were entirely lust-less for me, in each and every sense, not just a sexual sense. my body has been feeling unloved and lonely, suddenly being without touches and caresses and evans physical presence. i get so used to -literally- having him within reach, that once we're apart again, it feels like someone has ripped off one of my  limbs. i miss sleeping near him. i miss kissing, and hugging, and just being near him. i miss his smell and his taste.  it might sound odd, but it's always hard to shower after the last time we have sex before one of us leaves. it always feels like washing off not only his smell, his sweat, his ejaculate, but also his fingerprints to me. that first shower usually leaves me sitting on the floor of the shower, sobbing; an experience so bad, that i showered while he was still there this time, before i walked him to the hospital. i felt like i wouldn't be able to handle it without him in the house. i don't know what exactly triggers being emotional in showers, whether it is the fact one is naked, and alone, or because there is water already, tears aren't that obvious. i just know that when i am close to running on empty, close to breaking, showers sweep me over the edge, all the time. - happened this morning, too, when i felt so lonely, and lost and neglected after that first phone talk.  i've had trouble looking after myself, too. - i haven't felt like or had the energy for pampering myself, treating myself well, just dealing with myself in a loving way, caring for myself. it's hard to get back to being alone after sharing life with evan. deciding what to eat, cooking, eating, grooming, handling my body, are truly overwhelming activities. it was worst on the first few days after coming back: i found myself standing in the middle of the supermarket, unable to decide what i wanted. i sat in the tub, water streaming over me, unsure about what to do next: use that soap or wash my hair? - it's so tiring, it's so difficult to decide what to do, what to wear, how to handle me. i don't think i have ever been this out of tune with my body, and wokring out hasn't helped at all. - the only time i have felt in tune with my body has been during yoga class last thursday. i guess part of it is the cold, too. my body has cramped up as a reaction to it, all the flexibility, ease and suppleness of summer is gone.  regarding lust, it's been the same. there has been nothing. nada. no desire to masturbate, even though i fired up my gigolo in an attempt to ressurect my libido. no pleasure from my body. no warm fuzzy feelings.   before i left, evan and i went on a mission to get sexed out just in time for saying goodbye, like we usually do. it's a bit of a ridiculous but fun thing to do. - we're both well aware that neither of our libidos can be calmed down for long, unless there are major life stresses (think jen or a major depressive episode) - more sex than usual quite simply doesn't do the trick for long. attempting to get sexed out is more like a last effort of sharing time feeling good, bonding, enjoying ourselves, pleasuring each other (now that sounds corny) before we have to seperate. but right now, it seems like it has worked. almost too well.  it's not that i don't have a sex life when evan is not around, or am less of a sexual being: generally, my sexuality is first of all mine, and mine only, and not defined by anyone else. but of course my sexuality changes when i live it with my partner. sure, it remains mine- but it merges with his and in turn becomes  ours . i get so used to the sharing, that i forget what it's like to be sexual without him. it feels like my body has forgot what it's like alone. right now, all the images in my head of that sharing, of beautiful, loving, good stuff that happened just about two weeks ago, leaves me nothing but sad.  i miss it all, so much. i miss being and feeling sexual. i miss being touched and kissed and making love and having sex and everything in between.  i miss my body.

      i know it'll get better once we get used to being apart again, once we've established a new routine. but why does it have to hurt so much right now?  it hurts that this girl i don't know has moved in with him and susi, it hurts that he doesn't find the time to talk properly, that everything, the fucked up new flatmate with a fucking rental video takes priority over me.  i want to be easygoing and understanding and accepting that this is a time of change for him, but i just don't want to get under the wheels of this new life he has there. i want some space in that new life. i want to be important to him.  and right now i just don't feel like i am.

      i had another dream featuring evan and a saying goodbye theme last night.  it's the day i am supposed to leave. evan, me and his entire family are at the airport. strangely enough, i am walking around alone a lot. evan is busy doing something else at the aiport, which makes me sad. there is some reason why he is not with me, even though it is just a short while until i head off, and no matter how hard i convince myself it's okay, it isn't. whatever he is doing doesn't seem important to me.  i walk through the airport, and strangely enough still have some AUS dollars, that i am eager to spend, but i can't decide, mainly because i  don't feel like getting junk i'll have to throw out in a few months when i want to move permanently.  it's suddenly half an hour before the plane takes off. evan stops what he is doing, and we are trailed by his family. we pass a supermarket in the airport, and i realise i need to get a large jar of vegemite (which i forgot to get this time), but the shelf where the vegemite is supposed to be is empty.  it's fifteen minutes before my plane takes off, and we are heading up a staircase to where the plane will be. i hate it all, hate the rush, hate having so many people there, hate leaving, hate not having had time alone with evan, and i start sobbing and start waking up. while that happens, i realise that i don't want to wake up.  in my dream, evan is at least there.

      when challenger exploded 17 years ago, i remember sitting in a pew at our school's chapel a few days later, our priest gently prompting us to discuss the event, letting us tell stories about what we had seen on the telly, what the images had brought up, sharing sadness for the class that had lost their teacher, the kids who had lost their parents.  i remember one classmate of mine, 7 years old like me, saying that what he had seen when the  shuttle exploded and the debris - followed by white vapour trails- was falling, was god's hand reaching out, taking the people on board to him. i remember my classmate saying that to him, it felt like god was showing us that people should not takespace flighs for granted.  what an old testament view of god for a seven year old.  indeed, space flight has been pretty much taken for granted over the past decades, as so many people have noted since yesterday afternoon, with the richest of the rich buying package tours to the international space station. strangely enough, this columbia mission had been the first space mission in years, that i had been remotely interested in, had read information on and observed in a way.   urlLink the age , which i read front to back most mornings in melbourne, had had a few larger articles on the flight. namely on  urlLink ilan ramon , his life story, his being the first israeli in space and the picture of the moon, drawn by a boy in a concentration camp, that he was taking up there. also of interest to the melbourne paper had been a science experiment involving 8 golden orb spiders (dubbed "spidernauts") on board the aircraft, which students from local glen waverley college had developed, planned for 4 years and found sponsors for.  seeing the footage yesterday, first the pictures of the bright blue sky, a white vapour trail disintegrating, later those of debris, still smoking, on fields, near roads, in wooded areas, this morning that of a mission patch in grass, made me sad. as has been hearing the radio contact between mission control and columbia, commander rick husband saying "roger, but", a crackling, static noise and then silence, silence that grew longer and longer.  in contrast to what i felt like 17 years ago, i am not sure that "god" (in the christian definition of the word) is there to pick us up when we die, or what happens after life. i just hope it is something good, that we maybe go somehwere good. should there be a sanctuary, a place where we go, maybe those 7 souls that perished yesterday, on the wild ride that re-entry has been described by a former astronaut on cnn, had a bit of an advantage to get there quickly and directly, being as close to the heavens as they were.

      -15°C. that's been the temperature on my balcony early this morn. it has now warmed to a balmy -7°C.  i can't deal with the cold. since late last night, my back has been cramped up, most likely from working out yesterday - the temperature in the workoutroom was nice and comfortable when we started, but towards the end of the class, when we got to the back exercises, i could feel myself cooling out, the sweat making me shiver and uncomfortable. i slept with a hot water bottle on my back and have had one near me almost constantly since getting up, but that hasn't helped much; neither has a long hot shower, practically overheating the room, wearing an angora undershirt (and several more layers) and attempting some gentle stretches. i need a massage. i need my boy here.  to top it off, i went for some weekend shopping earlier today, snuggled up in enough clothing to feel reasonably okay outside, which of course made me sweat and too warm as soon as i entered a shop. grr. i doubt that i will stick to my plan of heading out into the snow today, i just don't want to risk getting to warm while hiking only to cool out quickly again, and making my back worse. hell, even walking feels terrible already. sucks. the weather  *is*  gorgeous, - it's sunny, the sky is bright blue, the air is clean. - it's just about 10°C too cold. brrr.

      letter to the editor in this week's  urlLink spiegel :    "when a dictator with his back to the wall is not using his weapons of mass destruction, it's quite safe to assume that he probably doesn't have them anymore anyway."    good point.  i wish  urlLink zeit  and  urlLink spiegel  came in english, too. there  can never be enough high quality journalism.

      as usual, essential guardian commentary.   urlLink peter preston: how many bodybags can we take?    "i've no idea what the figure in the pre-planning stage was. if it chimed with the breezy confidence of other plans, then it might have been much less than 5,000. but that was then - and this is now. no cheering iraqi crowds, no mass defection yet. expectations unfulfilled. so the death toll - however tiny on any historical comparison - may seem worse than expected. worse, too, the cameras and reporters gathered to chronicle easy victory, inevitably give added weight to the toll of uneasy struggle. (...) unacceptability 2003, prospectively, is yet another and another cargo of coffins heading into brize norton. more pomp, more grief, more footage. there's no need to wonder why the politicians are worried. they set their acceptability thresholds too low and now, in a macabre way, we have to live with them - and hope for a best case outcome. but there is a more durable lesson here for a pentagon pondering future conflicts. what the heart sees, the heart grieves."     urlLink madeleine bunting: bombs and biscuits     "so america is well on the way to losing the peace as the inherent contradictions of this war of liberation become apparent: you can't instill fear and respect at the same time, you can't bomb and hand out biscuits. and this is where the future becomes truly frightful because there's no way back, and if america and britain are not going to be welcomed and loved on the streets of basra and baghdad, they will make themselves feared instead. here, the logic of war takes grip and choices narrow. this war has to be won, and in the end the us will use any means necessary to do so - dragging its british ally with it into a bloody mess. in 1939, did the british ever imagine they could commit the dresden atrocity? war corrupts all of its participants.  already, the pressure is evident on britain's army in the plaintive comment of major charlie lambert of the royal scots dragoon guards: "when people don't play by the rule book, it is easy to make things very difficult for a much larger force which does play by the rules." at one point will american and british niceties about avoiding civilian casualties be relaxed as an unaffordable luxury? at what point will the nerves of frightened soldiers tautened by ambushes and suicide attacks - smiling peasant one moment, terrorist fedayeen the next? - turn ordinary decent men into monsters?   the coalition forces will give up on the rules while saddam hussein has never abided by them anyway. like anyone who has been cornered, he will in his desperation resort to anything - and all he has now are the lives of his people. he's used them cheaply many times before and now with 24/7 global media coverage, their blood is his most potent pawn, and he won't hesitate to spend it freely in urban warfare as shields, bombers, even targets. it will be grotesque, and it doesn't require a complicated understanding of moral reasoning to grasp that we will bear some responsibility for the atrocities he may commit in defending his country and regime. it is we who have invaded a sovereign nation, and there has always been a legitimate principle of self-defence.(..)

      'tis monday morning and i'm not working. bad me.  instead of sitting over my books or at least cleaning my flat, i'm sitting at the  urlLink laundromat/internet cafe  right now. as usual, i'm profiting from dieter's kindness and getting free coffee, and today i'm also profiting from the high speed connection: am downloading music recommended to me this weekend, and will later burn it, too. it's fun: i'm in control of the music for this place, now, caus the computer i'm using has loudspeakers attached, so right now everyone is listening to "long time running" by the tragically hip. nice.  am still feeling quite strange this morning. - am tired, and achy and just not functioning too well, even though the music and the coffee and chatting with dieter and the high speed connection and a monitor that isn't strangely tinted are all somewhat helping. last night (and that's just proof that something wasn't quite right with me), i started discussing the boy and our issues again with my mother, which i just shouldn't do. shouldn't do that with anyone, actually, should probably not write about it here, either. i realised that, too, when i chatted with  urlLink heather  yesterday (which was the first time in ages, and lovely). i want and need to talk about it, but words are so faulty and wrong. talking to hether, i also realised how egoistic some of this is, how all he sometimes seems to think is me-me-my-arm-is-broken-i'm-bored-when-i-have-shift-work-i'm-worse-off-than-you-are-me-me-me-you're-the-evil-jealous-one-me-me-me. who supported him during his last year of uni? how come now that i am asking for some support, it's suddenly too much? where's the balance? why is this tuning into a "who needs more support" competition? in any way, talking about this, writing about this all, i get too frustrated and bitter and realise how non-ok some things are, and that i pretend i am all cynical, when all i am is still hurt and scared and angry, too. i also think its not good, because i cement my opinions, without him having a chance to make things better. so i'd rather stop for now. i need to be talking and communicating him, first and foremost. after all we made some progress last week. let's see how it will continue. hopefully better than last weekend, when he didn't call me back after i left a message for him on saturday because "he didn't feel like it".  oh please, throw some crumbs of love on the floor for the little sparrow sitting underneath the breakfast table.  so maybe, for now, i will just quit talking (with some at least, probably not you, phoneboy, sorry 'bout that) and writing (right here at least) about the boy and our issues, for the most part at least, to really give me and us some time and de-stress this by trying to minimise my constant worrying about and analysing of the situation. words make things seem more definite than things feel like. right now, it all still feels in flux. of course, this censoring myself is a bit constructed, a bit fake. because i do worry, all the time, i do think about it, all the time. i am stressed by this, all the time. i hope it'll help to stop talking for a while. i really want to calm down and accept whatever the outcome will be and do what's best for me and us.  just to illustrate how stressed i am: i took a pregnancy test this morning, despite no firm reason. - i had started to wonder whether my health issues (tiredness, throwing up and the like) might be pregnancy related, even though i had two withdrawal bleeds since any partnered sex. - a family friend who's a doc actually asked my mom whether i was pregnant when she heard my hb was unusually low for me. this would have been the most non-perfect but oh-so typical time for an unplanned pregnancy: when the relationship is in deep crisis. alas, this morning, after five minutes, one sole blue line. so at least one thing i can quit worrying about for now. would have been against so many odds, anyway.  so.  what a monday so far.

      i'm feeling sick today.  hopefully no  urlLink sars  though: no coughing, no upper respiratory symptons at  all, just overall achiness, severe headaches, slight temperature, tiredness.  still ain't great.  my friend amelia from sydney, currently residing in another south-west german student town very much like mine, was going to be coming for a visit monday through wednesday, but we cancelled. fits both of us better, apparently: she's busy snogging fellow international students, while i'm busy feeling achy and bad. however, we assured each other this was "aufgeschoben, nicht aufgehoben".  so i'm home alone this sunday, feeling sick. anyone offering to come by and entertain me in biohazard-orange full protective speedos? please?

        out of time  ~blur~  where's the love song set us free too many people down everything turning the wrong way round and i don't know what love will be but if we start dreaming now lord knows we'll never clear the clouds  and you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time to open up your mind and watch the world spinning gently out of time  feel the sunshine on your face it's in a computer now gone are the future way out in space  and you've been so busy lately that you haven't found the time to open up your mind and watch the world spinning gently out of time  tell me i'm not dreaming but are we out of time? we're out of time out of time out of time out of time out of time   just saw the  urlLink video  for the first time, which is brilliant. it is a band-less video, following a female us marine & fighterpilot who is stationed on a warship through her preparations, ending with her standing on the runway on the ship, looking at the sunset while subtitles suggest that she is thinking about the end of her relationship with her partner, another marine.  urlLink "Like the song the video is a tender piece of work about distance and loss. It aims to distil the song's beauty into a new and unexpected place."   brilliant.  the first blur song in years that i like upon first hearing, which the boy will doubtlessly be happy to hear. - even though, i too, expect that he won't fail to notice possible references to us...

       urlLink the guardian: guenther grass - shaper of a nation's conscience :   "chancellor gerhard schroeder's refusal to join george bush's crusade to topple saddam hussein has made grass openly proud of his compatriots and the ruling elite for once. "every family in this country has the experience of two world wars, two lost wars, massive destruction, millions of dead, cities in ruins. people's mentality has changed. every generation has to face this and its consequences," he says.   he rejects the explanation, often used outside germany, that he and other germans have become pacifists. the more accurate picture, he argues, is that germans do not rule war out as a last resort but they have learned to think especially carefully before rushing into it. grass finds it ironic that germany was persistently urged by its western allies during the cold war to grow out of its status as a political dwarf. yet when it stands up, as schroeder has been doing over iraq, it is denounced."     yup, herr grass. agreed.

      someone will watch over me in my sleep tonight.  unfortunately no real flesh and bone bloke like my boy - i'll be sleeping with a  urlLink somnocheck  sleep monitor strapped to my upper body. - there's a home sleep screening test at my place tonight.  i just picked the monitor up at the pneumologists office and got instructions on how to wear it. the monitor will be strapped around my body, connected to a nasal tube (which i will have to tape to my face. great.) and a pulse & blood oxygen monitor on my finger.   the little thing will be measuring my breathing, oxygen saturation, pulse and body position and can therefore enable my doc to diagnose apnea, hypopnea, oygen saturation issues and heart irregularities.  why, you may wonder, all this trouble? you know (big confession), i  urlLink http://my.webmd.com/content/article/8/1680_54137">snore .   me being a 24 year old, very fit, normal-weight range female. yup.  obviously, i don't know how severely i snore: i've never heard myself snore (apart from once when i fell asleep during mediation and woke up because of the sound coming from my throat), but all fromer and current bed partners have assured me that i do (usually with appropriate comments on how cute it is), but it ain't right, so i'm doing something about it. - not just because snoring can be unhealthy in the long run (leading to heart problems), but also because i hate the idea of my bed partner(s) suffering.  my ent thinks the reason behind my snoring is my upper palate. it's apparently floppy. 20 years ago, i had my tonsils removed, and they apparently didn't operate that well. so i ended up with a floppy palate. the hypothesis is that it flops in the airflow when i breathe while sleeping, which causes the snoring.  so i'm getting my floppy palate toned. with radiowaves, baby! my ent plans on using  urlLink the celon method  on me, which would involve injecting my upper palate in 4 to 6 different places with a needle like instrument that sends low level radiowaves, causing coagulation in these places. within 6 weeks, the coagulated areas scar internally, firming and lifting the palate up. think facelift for the back of my mouth. the procedure should take 15 minutes, at the dosc office, using local aneasthesia, and the results should last a few years, too.  however, my ent, good doc that he is, won't do the op on me without being sure i actually "snore habitually" and am not suffering from  urlLink sleep apnea . the latter would suck, muchly. evan has been worried about it, actually. while he never witnessed any apnea episodes, he thought that my constant falling asleep in australia was reason enough to worry (i think he failed to realise though, how disrupted my sleep was, sleeping in living rooms for weeks, for 5 hours a night, tops). i'll know soon enough for sure: i'll be wearing the monitor tonight, will hand it back in on monday, get the results on tuesday. if i indeed snore habitually (and of course i worry that i won't snore tonight and whether i will be able to sleep between midnight and 8 when the monitor will be running), i'll get my palate radiowaved at the end of next month.  exciting.  funny moment with the doc showing me how to wear the monitor: he was strapping the thing round my body, loudly wondering whether they had any smaller straps because i'm so "small", telling me i was the oddest patient for this he has ever had - neither male, nor fat, nor over 50.  and he called me dainty.   dainty.   that's a first. and probably almost accurate when you compare me to the huge snoring blokes over 50 he usually treats.  he.

      it hasn't been a week for writing here. i did write several things during the week, but i was always too tired to post, and furthermore, the stuff never felt right upon re-reading.  i still wrote elsewhere. thoughts about the boy in daily emails to someone who was thankfully willing to listen, thoughts about the war  urlLink in a thread  at  urlLink scarleteen , which quite pointless. i get so agitated by kids repeating slogans from the telly and discussing current issues without any historical and political background, that i should simply save the time and energy and just not feel tempted to participate (apart from moderating, obviously). i am by no means the most knowledgable person ever in regards to the war in iraq and us foreign politics, and neither do i have the solution or the greatest insight: but i do follow the news (from a multitue of sources, too), have decent quality knowledge on the un and its (legal) works, and the politics of the last century. having someone tell me that s11 was the same for the us as wwi and wwii for europe, however, just shows me it isn't worth to post my (political & historical) opinions at scarleteen, because it will hit deaf ears anyway. which is okay - scarleteen isn't a political forum, after all, and furthermore, it is intended to be a forum for teens. - i should lower my expectations (now that age-ism, sorry.).  strange it's already friday today. - so much and so little happened all week. tuesday, i had my yoga class in the evening, which was good. ralph was away, so his girlfriend (whose name i forgot), who's also a yoga teacher and ayuveda practicioner, held it. - it was lovely. we were only girls again, and the vibe was just very nice and enjoyable. ralphs girlfriend is a very gentle, instructive teacher. like ralph, she sang mantras as we did sun salutations, which transformed them into a flowing, prayer like experience. so good. did lots of standing/balancing asanas, and i failed, miserably, just like i did last saturday. i do believe that balancing/standing asanas are a mirror of what you're like inside. - i was so shaky inside, so insecure and unsure (because of the boy), there was no way i could do a proper tree or half moon pose. also did partnered dancer pose, which felt so gracious. - should take a camera sometime. - i'd like to see an image of me doing a headstand, too. - have worked so hard on it, i can now get away from the wall for some moments, and am just now realising how i am supposed to be aligned.  but well, to the boy. his middle of the night call monday felt fake, done for the drama of waking me up at night, done because he thought i'd like it, done to make up for not picking the parcel up for 5 days. - as mentioned before, it left me crying for a good bit of the night. not good. tuesday was better, he called after his first day in casualties, and seemed happy and relaxed - i tried hard to measure up to it, was casual and easy going and not demanding at all. - didn't feel too authentic, but at least it wasn't troublesome. while we talked though, it became clear that evan hadn't fully looked through and appreciated all the things in the parcel. - which added to the hurt from the night before. i joked about it.  wednesday was rough - had a session with dr.k, the first since  urlLink the meltdown . subsequently, it just wasn't any fun. he thinks it's over, but that i should go to melbourne anyway. rough stuff to hear. i was quite miserable, always on the verge of crying, repeatedly proclaiming that i didn't want to cry, at which i succeeded, sucker for control that i am. must have been a sad thing to look at, me on the couch, telling him about what is the biggest crisis i've had in years, a crisis that is literally turning my life (& plans) upside down, smiling (as usual, compulsively), chit-chatting like it was nothing, sugar coating my hurt, pain that evan caused by not caring. didn't hold up for long though, wednesday evening and night were spend crying.  yesterday, however, might have been the turn-around, who knows. i am still unable to write about what exactly happened and whether it has changed anything, but finally, for the first time in weeks, evan and i actually talked, for real. real talking, real listening. some stuff that was said hurt (and still hurts), other stuff was indeed resolved. am i ready to proclaim all is well again? no. did we agree on everything? no. however, we reconnected, and that *is* progress. it felt like the old days again, and we finally are on track with what the other one thinks.  - even though it is hard for me to realise he is less sure than in the past. i recently read an email he send a year ago, in which he wrote about talking to his best friend about proposing to me, and it hurts that he's stepped back so far, feels that slower progress, less committment is better. i observe this change and can't help but wonder how that happened, what went wrong.  however, all i can do is accept the way it is. - accept, that we disagree on what it takes to move continent. i believe that it will always be scary, always be risky, that there will always be insecurity, and that waiting too long is a possible death sentence for our love. evan, however, thinks there will come a point when it's not scary anymore, he wants maximum security, minimised risks, and thinks that moving too early is a possible death sentence. so yeah, we disagree on this basic, terribly important issue. and that's troublesome, and hurts. it feels like he has fallen out of love with me, to a certain extend. he's stepping back and observing, at a time when moving closer and feeling more are actually more direly needed.  i hope that he regains the trust in us that he used to have. i wish he'd stop analyzing, and started feeling again. i wish he'd finally book the silly flight for july.

      nothing quite like showing up at the blood bank and not being able to donate. by hb is too low. my hb! i never had any trouble with it, had steady (if not overly high but still pretty good for a young woman) upper 13 g/dl values... but  this morning: 11,7g/dl. it's not that low. but too low for donating (you need at least 12,5 g/dl), and low enough to worry. anything under 12 g/dl can be a sign of anemia.  i have no doubt this is a side effect of my recent restrictive eating and all this over-exercising. warning sign? yup. big one, too. time to look after myself,  before this turns into  urlLink iron-deficiency anemia .  the doc was super firendly, told me not to stress and gave me iron supplements.  but i still left feeling like a loser.

       i got a funny little advertisement email today from  urlLink emi/virgin australia  today, informing me of     urlLink "the director's cut of the video that you will never see.... on the 14th of april robbie williams will be releasing his new single 'come undone'. robbie has outdone himself this time with his brand new video clip - so much so that it's so explicit it won't be shown on any tv shows! needless to say robbie feels this is his best clip to date!"     to heat up things, the little spammy email from emi contained a couple of pics, with funny little headlines:     robbie comes undone! such a saint, such a whore! explicit sex scenes! excessive violence! binge drinking! drug use! inappropriate use of amphibians!     inappropriate use of amphibians. *chuckle*  if there is inappropriate use of amphibians in music videos, there must be appropriate use of them in that medium then, too. what would that look like, i wonder?  round here, the video is on high rotation on mtv, viva and viva plus - if censored. it *is* a very good video (would be hard to mess it up when it's featuring robbie anyway). i like the visuals, the colours, the whole set up and atmosphere, which fit the song very well. 'tis about hedonism, after all, and hypocrisy and reality, so all that make-up, bad clothing, sex, snorting of drugs and cockroaches crawling from mouths and flashing skulls make sense. - i did see the un-edited version when it premiered on mtv, after all.  it's so funny how it was attempted in the media to create outrage over this, a music video in times when there are so many more important things to get enraged about.   robbie has gone to far!  (uhm, why?)   he's glorifying drug use!  (considering he shows how ugly drug use and the morning after is, not exactly.)   he's pissing and wearing pink socks!  (so? don't we all?)   how unnecessary to walk around ine his y-fronts!  (i think that was something we all most definitely needed to see. nice package, robbie dear.)   uh!  insects! from mouths and between legs! it's disgusting!  (i like the insect & snake idea, and the bodies of the little things are as shiny as the rest of the video. oh, we're all snakes.)    the title of the song refers to  urlLink this movie !  robbie is in bed with a woman and a man in the video! robbie must be gay!  (who knows. maybe. does it matter? not really. are the scenes good? i think they are, so what?)  oh robbie dear, you little smart'n'sexy provocative controversy whore.

      the boy called at 1am, waking me up in the process, obviously, to tell me that he picked up the parcel and liked it. which is great. but it's still there, the feeling of being disconnected, like hanging in mid-air. tried to tell him what i feel like at the moment, how hard it is to be apart, how hard it is to not have any idea what's up, and it just didn't work out. he didn't react, really, or get what i meant. or whatever. crying in the middle of the night. how great and useful.

       urlLink grim  linked to something  urlLink tom from plasticbag.org  wrote friday:   "...Anyone who is 100% sure of the morality of their position with regard to the war in Iraq probably hasn't understood the issues involved. Be prepared to have your mind changed. Remain open to new ideas. Protest / Advocate only what you really believe to be true..."    and it's true. today, like yesterday, i found myself wondering a lot about the point of the protests and my views and what is right and what is wrong. i edited yestersday's post and deleted some of the bile.  it's easy to get enraged and start seeing black in white when all there is are shades of grey.  what if i am wrong, after all?   like tom said, it's best to stand up for what you really believe to be true. after some more discussions with my dad, it's a bit clearer what i can stand up for: it's my belief in peace, my believe in the un and diplomacy and in the compassion and kindness of people. i can not stand behind blank anti-americanism, even if i strongly disagree with us politics and its pre-emptive war. i can not stand behind people carrying signs saying  "stop the genocide"  (which fails to recognise that there has been a genocide against the kurds in iraq) or  "weapons instructors into the us" ,  "bush to den haag"  or  "my president is a psychopath" . it ain't that simple. in contrast to that,  "you can't extinguish fire with fire"  and   "bombs don't built democracy"  are slogans i would carry, too.  overall, today isn't much better than yesterday.  went to the gym this morning, which was nice - did back and lower body, until my legs felt wobbly. sunday mornings at the gym are empty - i was there from 8:30am on, first almost alone, then at least the only girl in the weight room/free weights. overall, it was calming and relaxing. am happy that my performance is still okay, even though i worked out less while at home. the boy gave me a call, too. he successfully avoided being the one to receive a patient with suspected  urlLink sars  30 minutes before his shift was over, by flirting with nurses. good on him for the flirting, for a change. i've been joking all last week that he should be careful about sars, and now this. reality is so much not funny. however, our phone call again didn't provide the coziness and connectedness i currently crave. maybe i'm asking for/expecting  too much from him in his current situation, who knows. he'll be picking up the parcel tomorrow - he's got the whole day off. he should let me know how he likes it after getting it, shouldn't he? i'll wait and see. and if he won't get in touch, it'll be just another kick into my gut (i was tempted to write "stab into my poor little heart", that would have been too pityful and whiny), nothing new. i could cry.

      i just saw al-jazeera coverage that featured close-ups of dead american soldiers.  they seem to have shots to the head, their faces are covered with dust or burned and smeared with blood, but are still recognisable, their combat gear is torn, their underwear exposed, their bodies are being handled roughly by those presenting them to the cameras. i feel for the mothers and fathers and partners of these dead soldiers, just like i feel for those who have to endure the bombings (like mentioned before, compassion is all encompassing). i can not imagine what it must be like to see your loved ones this way, dead in the evening news, being shown off.  these images made me think of  urlLink hannes wader's song "es ist an der zeit" , a song that always moved me.   "es blieb nur das kreuz als einzige spur von deinem leben, doch hoer meinen schwur fuer den frieden zu kaempfen und wachsam zu sein faellt die menschheit noch einmal auf luegen herein dann kann es geschehn, dass bald niemand mehr iebt, niemand, der die milliarden von toten begraebt. doch laengst finden sich mehr und mehr menschen bereit, diesen krieg zu verhindern, es ist an der zeit"   it's actually the german version -with different, more hopeful, optimistic, activist wording, of the song  urlLink "no man's land" by eric bogle .   "and I can't help but wonder now, willie mcbride, do all those who lie here know why they died? did you really believe them when they told you "the cause?" did you really believe that this war would end wars? well the suffering, the sorrow, the glory, the shame, the killing, the dying, it was all done in vain, for willie mcbride, it's all happened again, and again, and again, and again, and again."     ------------------------------------

       conversation at my mother's bookshop yesterday.    my dad notices that the customer he is serving is wearing a posh-looking "no war in iraq" button on his label.    dad:  "oh, i just noticed your button. neat.- where did you get it from?"  customer:  "i got it from my union. - i work at thyssen, our union organised protest against the war during our lunch break on thursday."  dad:  "you work at thyssen? you own thyssen stocks then, too, don't you?"  customer:  "yes."  dad:  "now did I get it right: there were peace protests at thyssen? you're aware that thyssen's steel is used for tanks and bombs, that thyssen has supported iraq for decades (just a few tidbits of their activies: companies of the thyssen group urlLink  headed a consortium which in 1980 built a plant south of Baghdad at which poison gas and biological weapons were developed ,  urlLink supplied turbopumps for the engines of SCUD missiles  and apparently assisted in bunker building, too. and that's just iraq. they have super good relations involving tanks and technology in iran, lybia, all the good places.), are you? you're aware that your stocks make you profit from this was then, yup? don't you think protest against this war is rather hypocritical in your position then?"  customer:   -silent-   i tell you, he's turning into an obnoxious, argumentative old man. and i love him.    post script: apparently though, my dear dad later on eased this little discussion, by getting all catholic, talking about his experiences in wwii and talking about peace with the customer, so maybe this customer wasn't lost, after all.

       "so why do i find it so difficult to concentrate on anything else"   urlLink stuart wondered today , and i, too, wonder, because it's similar for me. i feel lobotomised by current events and the tv. i should probably just turn it off, but i can't.  the events that were held in response to the war in my city today seemed and felt not right.  the prayer i went to was alright, they had an interesting reading and sermon by a pax christi (which is a roman catholic peace initiative) priest. he read from the revelation (which is actually the part of the bible i know and like best) and talked about the imagery, and followed with thoughts on the religious imagery that george w. uses - interesting stuff, well thought through. i realised during the prayer, how deeply embedded christian culture, specifically catholicism is in me, but also noticed how detached i feel from it. - i can say the words and prayers and sing the songs, but they are without meaning, they don't move me, no matter how hard i try to bring a meaning back to them by consciously removing the ritualistic aspects. i feel more at home chanting mantras these days. how strange.  the demonstration was strangely emotionless, too. it felt ritualistic and pointless. i kept thinking how ridiculous it is that we middle-class people in a small town in germany take 2 hours off (fitting in nicely between shopping for organic food on the farmer's market, and settling in front of the telly for saturday soccer) on a beautiful spring day to walk through the street carrying signs and think it makes a difference to those who run this war. they don't care what's happening in their own country where they keep cutting constitutional rights left right and centre, why would they care about us, in a country that has fallen from grace already because our goverment opposed this war (which wasn't out of care for iraqis, or belief in the un, but because they wanted re-election. one would think george w. would understand this motive and be easier on gehard).  i just didn't have a specifically good day today.  the boy and i, we talked this morning, and exchanged views on the war (others would call it argueing), but had to stop in the middle of it, because he went out for dinner. added to my feeling of being left behind, disconnected and very low on his priority list again. - it's such an acute feeling, i wonder what it means, i wonder whether we can rebuilt what we used to have, i wonder what it would take for that to happen. i'm sad, because there is so little coming from him, that i find myself withdrawing, too, which isn't helping the situation, obviously. withdrawing seems like the better option though: being extra pushy would only make matters worse. it just doesn't seem like the right time to bring up what's bothering me, what i feel is not going right, - so i'm being the little martyr for now, swallowing it down and hoping it will pass, once his life gets more settled. don't know how to deal with my jealousy though, which keeps creeping up, too. no wonder though, is it, when everyone else takes priority over me? i don't know. what also keeps sneaking into my mind, and hurts, is that he still hasn't picked up my parcel from the post office. it arrived on wednesday, and he claims neither he, nor anyone he knows (you know, none of his flatmates, none of those he keps swopping work for) had had the chance to pick it up. - it makes me wonder why i rushed to get it all packed up so quickly, basically ran through town to get all the things i know he'd like together and also spend so much money to get it there quickly if he doesn't care. i wonder what he cares about in the first place: it doesn't seem to be anything concerning me, not the sms, the emails, the calls.  it's sad, but right now it feels like people other than my partner, some of whom have never met me irl, seem to care more about hearing from me and interacting with me, than he does. comparing people like this is evil spirited, of course, and i know it - like i wrote above, these are changing times for him, and i really should stop this and support him and be quiet and the little martyr. - it's just not working very well, and it feels so fake, so calculating, so wrong. that should tell me something, i guess, shouldn't it?  this afternoon, i went to the once a month saturday yoga class with bettina. - it was just katrin, bettina and me, so we got lots of attention, and lots of difficulty: a different kind of sun salutation that included the warrior pose i (virabhadrasana),  urlLink warrior pose iii  and  urlLink half moon pose  and subsequently made me topple over. uh, yeah. also attempted  urlLink pincha mayurasana  which was scary and difficult. headstand seems easy compared to this: i can trust my arms and shoulders to hold me and carry my weight in that - but my hands and elbows? bettina helped me hold the pose for a few seconds, but the feeling remained strange and scary. something else to work on, i guess. overall though, the class was good and energising. katrin and i made plans to go to the sauna together on wednesday (girls night at the gym sauna, - which is preferable over there, i don't like sitting next to body builder blokes showing off their dicks and ogling my abs, checking whether i am working them out alright. cultural lesson: we germans are naked in saunas). am not sure whether she's someone i have stuff to talk about, but it's good to have some plans, and it's good to make an effort, i think. like mentioned before: i need people around. lastly, on the way home, i passed by a poster proclaiming the start of a 10 week ashtanga and massage course starting friday in two weeks. i do have time on fridays, the location is within practically walking distance, too.... am unsure though, whether adding another discipline and yet another teacher is such a good idea. so far, sivananda teamed up with the bit of yvengar and ashtanga that ralph does serves me well. but then... i don't know. bettina might soon not run the class at my gym anymore: we're so few people, i wonder whether they won't cancel her class, soon. overall, though, that ashtanga couse sounds too good to pass by, the guy who will run it sounds knowledgable from the bio provided on the poster, and massage... hmmm. i'll go and write down the number from the poster tomorrow, i guess, and give the guy a buzz. if i can afford it, i'll do it. more time out of the house, more yoga, more new people. all good reasons, i think.  that much for now. not that i have anything to do this saturday night, but flipping channels on the telly (they all seem to be anxiously waiting for the next bombings, little to show, apparently), and probably going to bed, soon. as unexciting as it gets.

        "I've had the TV on all afternoon, watching it while I work. Right now, I'm watching tiny pixelated people moving around on the deck of an aircraft carrier. This scene imparts absolutely no information, knowledge, or perspective to the viewer. I understand that the assault of Iraq is important to cover, but what about the protests around the world, the terrorist suspects on the loose with possible dirty bombs, and the plans for humanitarian aid? Those things are just as important to the story, and the news channels have devoted about 2 minutes to covering them over the course of the entire afternoon, opting instead to fawn over U.S. military might, their tech toys, and, wheeee, look at us, we're embedded."     urlLink kottke: Note to anchors and reporters: stop smiling   indeed, indeed. i'd add: also stop being so thrilled about your cool computer animations and touch screens you can draw on.

      it's 5am, and i can't sleep anymore. - have been up for almost an hour.  i fell asleep last night while the tv was on, turned it off at some point but kept waking up from dreams that were full of fear. no, not war dreams, just dreams full of strange threatening situations, me and evan in homes that weren't ours, being pursued by people who scared me. i can't pity myself for being up though. how could i dare to do that when 2 time zones away, people endured, heard, smelled, felt what i only saw on the telly?   i've given up sleep for now, the tv is on again, and they are showing the sky over baghdad, where it's already day, and for now, there are no explosions visible - but then, the journalists seem to think the next bombings will come soon and possibly last all day.   urlLink heather wrote eloquently about what she's feeling today , and indeed, like her, i wonder (but can not express that well, that's what i struggled with last night, i guess) how seeing those bombs fall on baghdad last night can be any less traumatic than seeing planes fly into the world trade center, or israeli attacks on palestinian refugee camps or the bombing campaigns in vietnam, or -for me- seeing pictures of a burned down dresden. heather wrote, after expressing she believes that all humans are capable of compassion and kidness:   "what I don't understand is how anyone -- and i'm talking regular folks, world leaders and politicians should be more accountable and caring, but flatly, they often are not, and usually act primarily in their own self-interest and to win nationwide popularity contests -- can set that compassion aside, or simply not feel it."   and that's exactly what i was trying to say.  yesterday, strolling through my city around noon, on a glorious, blue-skied first day of spring out on the market, i felt how privileged i am. this will sound pathetic, but i walked along the market and shopped for plants for my balcony, and some fruit, chatted to the vendors and while doing that felt so privileged i am to be able to do as i please on a friday, priviledged that there were stalls full of good stuff for me to look at and pick, to live in a democracy, choose a religious belief and whether to live it, to have an abundance of media to look at and evaluate, to have education, relative equality, access to health care and above all safety. knowing that two time zones away, there are people who have not known this safety, is beyond my grasp.  last night, when i saw the pictures of the  "shock and awe"  attack (i actually checked the dictionary again, to be sure "awe" means what i thought it did, i wondered whether i had overreacted at first because i misunderstood, but alas, i didn't), i called my mom. i had just come back from a dinner with a mate from australia who is studying here for two sememsters, and had had two hours of pleasurable chatting about afl and the finer points of german literature. - what a change to suddenly see these pictures, i needed some immediate contact with someone, i was literally sick to my stomach.  i talked to my dad, too, who saw the images on the tv, too, but kept asking whether i thought a dictator like saddam  "could be prayed away" . he saw some demonstrations and a vigil in hometown yesterday, and was very cynic about the people who were there (most of the "old 68er", people who were involved in the student protests of the late 60's, who my father detests with a passion), and i had a hard time -being as upset as i was- talking to him about it, and why i believed it was still good to be out there doing whatever one deemed helpful, be it praying of whatever kind, having a happening (apparently, a sign saying "baghdad, 3600km" was put up in a central place of hometown, surrounded by crosses) or a demonstration.  i was trying to convince myself as much as him, when i was arguing my case for protest. i am still not sure whether i believe it will make a difference that i (and hopefully thousands of other people) will head out in the late morning: first to a multi-religious peace prayer (chanting  shanti om  to myself, i guess), then to our demonstration.  my cynicism and detachement from protest and activism (which dieter noticed on on thursday), while i feel so strongly when seeing these images, yet lack the words, still puzzles me.  i guess it's because this is more complex than many seem to realise, and i can not stand behind one sided-ness that fails to recognises that. i feel strongly about saddam being evil (a suppresor to both the majorit in his country, and the kurds), that iraq will hopefully be better without him, yet do not believe this war, these tackily-named attacks are the right way to deal with him or the right way to bring democracy to his people, that a part of me can not stand behind some of the simplified chants people will chant, the overly simplistic imagery that will be depicted in speeches, and the oh-so-hip-anti-americanism that might shine through, too.  i cringed, on thursday, about references made by a speaker about the international criminal court and about our german constitution, that were simply wrong, about a peace song spontaenously sung by someone, that was simply horrible. it's just that the short-sightedness, the lack of real information, the prevalence of slogans and propaganda of some of these activists is unbelievable - you know, those who cuddle with israeli politics,  while failing to give one second of a thought to palestine and whether israeli settling policy (which is robbing people of the land they have worked and lived on for hundreds of years) might have a tiny thing to do with people walking on buses with explosives round their bellies. interestingly enough, it's often devout christians, who so conveniently fail to feel compassion for palestinian christians. thankfully, apart from those references to international and constitutional law on thursday, expressions of the short/one-sided/wrong kind have been limited in regards to iraq at the demonstrations here yet, but who knows what has been written in kitchens around freiburg to be said today.  no matter what, it will be interesting, and at the least, i will hopefully walk home with a feeling of comunity afterwards and a bit less cynic, knowing i am part of the dissenting majority.  related:  urlLink waferbaby:  urlLink brainstorm: does protesting work?

      i already can not stand looking at the telly anymore. it leaves me too upset.  i hated those guessed "news" we had until tonight, the speculations, the "experts", the pictures of the sky over baghdad. above all, i hate those flashy animations all channels seem to like so much because they don't have any real footage. - little computer made movies, interactive maps, featuring low flying helicopters, that drop little soldiers carrying rifles in oil refineries, or low flying missiles that hit underground bunkers. all tv channels also seem to love touch screen maps, everywhere i switch to, anchor(wo)men and experts, are widly circling and arrowing touch screens and satellite maps.  "they could go there, or there/they are definitely going to go this way or that way/what we see there are the burning oil fields/these are troop movements/they will go there, and there and then in three days they will be in baghdad"   these images of war that we got to see until tonight, they were strange. - sky over houses in baghdad, light flashes, tanks in the desert, surrounded by dusk, journalists who all seem to be standing at the same street in baghdad, tanned and dressed up with kyftas, iraqi soldiers seemingly surrendering to us forces, walking in a line, hands above their heads. to me, it all seems very removed, and that echoes what it was like 12 years ago. - just that 12 years ago, the image quality was even lower, and there were no "embedded" journalists, no videophones, no satelltite phones.  and now, since half an hour, they are there, the images of a real war: baghdad, burning. clouds of smoke, lightened red by more expolisions, in the city centre. seeing those images has been even worse. i can't help but wonder whether (and hope that) these damn missiles are as accurate as the us military claims they are. i hope they indeed just hit public buildings and palaces and whatever else, but i doubt it. they scare me, these images, the thoght of what it muse be like to sit in a house in baghdad now. i wonder and worry about civilians, what are thy doing now? where are they hiding? what must it feel like when the earth shakes and the bombers fly overhead and drop more of these bombs. i also worry about what kind of reaction these images might provoke in some parts of the world. - will they make someone hate the us even more and go out on a street with a bomb tied to his stomach?  i wonder whether only a country like the us, that has never experienced a bombing war against it's civilians on it's own soil can start attacks like those they are currently carrying out on baghdad. i am well aware this idea is flawed, as the uk, obviously, had its share of bombings at home during wwii, and is involved in this, too. but still - doing this must come easier when you don't know what it is like from the other side.  round here in germany, the images of bombed down and burned out cities are still very present, memories of what it is like when the sirens wail and the bombers come are still in our collective memory. it's been 60 years since many of our cities were bombed. - people still remember, buildings still have marks. in the back of our cathedral, a picture shows how much of my city was destroyed, and that the only thing intact was the cathedral. - and that was purely accidental, geography (a hill in the city centre) made it impossible for british planes to fly low enough to bomb it, too. where my house stands today, everything was bombed out, burned down.   no worries, i am not going to dispute wwii - i see may 8th 1945 (as all germans i know) as the day we were liberated, indeed. the way there, however, with bombings specically aimed at bombing civilians into surrendering, is something i have trouble dealing with and that i do not believe to have been the only way there. did you know that cities with middle-age city centres were specifically picked because they'd burn well? how much culturally important buildings were specifically targeted? have you seen pictuers of dresden?  last weekend, my dad and i talked about war, discussing a book on the allied bombings on germany in wwii, his memories of it, and my grandparents memories of the war. - my dad was born in 1941, and has some memories, the sort of faint, hazy childhood memories one has, singular images, feelings.  one of these singled out images is a tank in the backyard of the house  where my grandma, my uncle and he lived (my grandfather was on the eastern front, where he was wounded, twice, but returned from in one piece, after being a pow, in late 1947). it must have been in early spring 1945, he thinks: it was a british tank, and he remembers a bag with dead chicken the british soldiers had taken (bits of them sticking out of the bag), hanging from it.  for some weeks, the front being just kilometres away (the village where my dad has lived all his life, and where i grew up, too, is very close to the rhine, in an industrial area, and was hence strategically important, and under constant bombings, too, because of steel mills and coal mines and weapon companies - some of the cities around where among the most seriously destroyed in germany, with more than 90% of the city centres destroyed), my grandmother could only sneak out once a day to get water from the well on the other side of the street for herself and her two boys. - my dad's brother günther died during the war, at 8 months, because he suffered from a gastro-intestinal disorder, and neither special food nor the medical care needed were available.  my dad also remembers sitting in the cellar with his brother and grandma and the local priest when the bombings happened, he remembers the alarms and the noises. - the priest would stay all night and day, and sneak to the next neighbour at dusk, to stay there for a whole day, too. walking along the street during the day was too dangerous.  in the us, there is no such memory of war and destruction at home. no one who had to experience living in a cellar for fear of bombings in a war against a regime they never supported. no one there had to fear being shot on the way to the well, like my grandma. lucky them, indeed, that they never had a regime on their own soil. never a war. never sirens wailing at night.  i wonder also, how someone can see these images of tonight, and believe this is bringing peace.how can setting the sky alight do this? how can someone see these images, and not be shaken by sadness and concern for civilians. it's beyond my imagination what it must be like - but i wonder: where is the compassion for them, concern about what this is doing to everyone experiencing it? bombings do not teach people democracy, but instead you can bomb a society into collective post traumatic stress, and deeply install a culture of hate and violence and revenge in those who experience this.  i'm upset and sad.

        "It started when the government, in the midst of a worldwide economic crisis, received reports of an imminent terrorist attack. A foreign ideologue had launched feeble attacks on a few famous buildings, but the media largely ignored his relatively small efforts. The intelligence services knew, however, that the odds were he would eventually succeed. (...) But the warnings of investigators were ignored at the highest levels, in part because the government was distracted; the man who claimed to be the nation's leader had not been elected by a majority vote and the majority of citizens claimed he had no right to the powers he coveted. He was a simpleton, some said, a cartoon character of a man who saw things in black-and-white terms and didn't have the intellect to understand the subtleties of running a nation in a complex and internationalist world. (...) Nonetheless, he knew the terrorist was going to strike (although he didn't know where or when), and he had already considered his response. When an aide brought him word that the nation's most prestigious building was ablaze, he verified it was the terrorist who had struck and then rushed to the scene and called a press conference."    nope, this ain't about george w.  urlLink when democracy failed: the warnings of history . essential reading.

      the demo was good. - far more people than i ever expected. picked up dieter from the laundromat, and chatted and walked with him: we'll go as a big group on saturday. i realised, talking to him about what the speakers were saying, about what has happened, what we expect will happen, how very cynical i am about the power of the people, about social awakening and activism. i wish i believed it made a difference, i wish i believed that the people will flood the streets this weekend in protest and that it will make a difference, but deep down inside, a part of me doesn't believe that, as much as i try.

       random.   i was in the car when i heard the news on the radio that the inspectors were urged to leave iraq. since then i have even less hope that there is not going to be one more war happening in the world tomorrow. i have no doubts that saddam hussein is a dictator that the world would be a better place without. however, history has shown that sanctions and wars make dictators stronger instead of weaker. furthermore, this is not going to be a "war against terror". i fear this is going to be a war that will create more terror, more fear, that this will be a war that will make the world less safe. feels like time for good thoughts, prayer (if you like), meditation and continued demonstration of all kind.    ------------------------------------

      it's been beyond busy, this past week, and has left me tired and brain dead. the parents are returning this afternoon, which means my work at the bookshop is done and i can head home monday. yay. i can't wait to get my routine back. in any way, i have a lot on my mind, but just can not be bothered to write right now. neither here, nor the emails due to so many.  more monday, from the privacy and comfort of home. yeah.

       urlLink the age: blonde magnetism :  "I got wolfish looks from men and complicit smiles from blonde women, who seemed to acknowledge my beaconlike hair as if I was now a member of an elite club," she writes, recalling that she was suddenly given preferential treatment at the market as well as at the London Library."   might sound overboard, but it's true. it's a shocker how much you're noticed when you're blonde, and since i've been growing my hair and hence have more of that blondeness, it's been getting even more severe. quite funny. interesting article, and definitely a book i'd like to read.

       urlLink friday five!    1. do you like talking on the phone? why or why not?  i like talking on the phone. i like voices and talking. as easy as that.   2. who is the last person you talked to on the phone?  my mom, last night, asking whether everything worked out at the shop yesterday.   3. about how many telephones do you have at home?  one phone. one mobile.   4. have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? what happened?  i encounter people with what i deem to be really bad phone manners all the time. just yesterday, someone called my parent's place about a complaint my mother made regarding an environemental hazard caused by a local factory two weeks ago. the woman from the clean up/complaint place was first off not coherent, didn't cohrenrelty express at the start of the call who she was and why she was calling, didn't give the correct days the complaint was made and the incident happened and was just overall insulting, rude, and not coherent, didn't leave her name, spelled the number wrong, and so on. after hanging up, i actually screamed because she sucked so much at being on the phone.   5. would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? why or why not?  most of the time, i prefer calls. - they're just done and over with more quickly, and most importantly, you actually have instant  interaction , which neither snail mail nor emails give. for the boy and me, the phone is our lifeline. nothing can replace it, we write emails, too, but the phone is our primary contact method, and could never be replaced with icq or another instant messenger for example. if i am very busy and actually don't want to speak to someone (and that happens), i often drop an email telling them i'm busy and when i'll re-appear. there are times when i just can not be bothered with chattery catching up calls, because i am too tired or edgy. for simple information supply, email is good, and sometimes, i send the occasional snail mail letter, too: some stuff can't be done via email - actually had to send two real letters this week, one to my uni's student services to request a new student id, the other to cancel a bank account. in general though: if i can do something via the phone, i do it that way.

       urlLink zoran djindjic, serbian prime minister, was assasinated this afternoon.   after seeing interviews with him over the last years, i admired him for his firm belief in democracy, his belief in making things happen through tireless activism and creating a good future for the balkan by connecting with western europe. he repeatedly expressed hope that within 10 years, serbia would be part of the eu. he's been called the "serbian jfk" because he was attractive, educated, a man of reforms, even if they were tough. how terrible to see him be assasinated, like jfk.  zoran djindjic was doubtlessly the greatest politican to have come out of serbia, one of the fiercest democrats and europeans of the last decade. what a loss to serbia/montenegro, the balkan in general, and to europe. it will be impossible to replace him. - thinking about what might happen in serbia now is worrisome.

       urlLink how utterly ridiculous can one get?   shouldn't us politicians spend their time worrying about more important stuff on the "eve of a war" they are currently choosing to start? shouldn't they be spending time thinking about how to protect the people of iraq during this war about oil, about how to minimise the "collateral damage" that will hit women and children the hardest (as usual), shouldn't they get behind more and tougher inspections instead?  other people might find this name change on the menu thing funny. - i find it revolting and worrisome.  really, i wonder whether those stupid republican politicians behind this idea honestly thought this would have any impact on us in europe who oppose war with iraq. instead of insulting us (no one in europe eats "french fries" we eat "pommes frites" or chips, mates), or scaring us, or whatever else, it makes us rest more assured we don't want to be on the same side with those who eat "freedom fries".

      what an end to that troubled week for the boy and me:  evan fractured his wrist on thursday while playing netball.martyr that he is, he played the entire game after his fall ("can't leave the team alone!"), and idiots they are, the other doctors on the team deemed his injury "harmless" - while fiona the physio (you know, the one who wants to get inside his pants) thought he should go to the ed immediately. unfortunately, he didn't though, but instead suffered all night until he dragged himself there early friday.  of course, as usual, when evan does something, he does it right: he got himself a distal third  urlLink scaphoid   urlLink  fracture  on his left hand.  fracture of the wrist sounds quite harmless - unfortunately though, that scaphoid fracture can apparently be a meanie. not only will the boy be in a cast for at least 6 weeks (no working out, no driving, being unable to put lines into patients, being unable to do full examinations, no use of left hand, typing discharge summaries with one hand etc.), this thing can have serious consequences if it doesn't heal well.  let me quote from  urlLink the bones home page: the interactive hand    urlLink scaphoid fractures     "scaphoid fractures are known to have unpredictable healing. this is due to the unique anatomy of the scaphoid itself. the fracture itself often cuts off normal blood circulation to pieces of the bone. also, other wrist bones attached to each end of the scaphoid move broken pieces away from each other - so strongly that it may not be possible to hold them together with any type of cast.  for this reason, these fractures may heal slowly (delayed union) or not at all (nonunion). also, if circulation to part of the bone is cut off and not recovered, that part of the bone will deteriorate (avascular necrosis) and lead to degenerative arthritis.  (...)  conservative treatment involves prolonged immobilization for as many months as the fracture takes to heal. because some fractures will fail to heal despite casting for a year or more, surgery may be needed to hold the bone pieces in place. surgery to promote healing is most often recommended for displaced fractures and those which have failed to heal despite casting. this involves special hardware and possibly a bone graft. this type of surgery is not always technically possible. degenerative arthritis is a definite possibility with these injuries and may require future reconstructive surgery. exercise and therapy is recommended after the fracture heals.  (now, do is see someone already queing up to take position as his personal physio?)  other problems include weakness, persistent soreness, visible deformity, reflex sympathetic dystrophy and other possible problems. stiffness after a scaphoid fracture is almost always seen."    trouble with a hand is one of the worst things to happen to a doctor, really. it's not like evan was ever planning to become a surgeon, but you need a well functioning hand as a doc, period.   thankfully, after the folks in ed had stopped laughing when he turned up yesterday morning, they referred him straight to the top ortho folks at the hospital, and evan got first class (free) treatment, including an mri, and a cast by the ortho surg registrar (who's usually above these duties). nice. they were considering surgery but for now chose the cast. i am not sure why they considered surgery -  need to ask him whether his fracture is actually displaced or not. hm. i swear, i learned more about anatomy of the hand and fractures and treatment in the past hour than i ever thought i'd ever need. blessed be the internet.   i'm a bit worried whether he will actually rest the hand as much as he has to and get through the day okay. apparently, the flatmates have been helpful so far, but will they do that for a full six weeks? will he have to change rotations? he's supposed to be on ed in three weeks, but would be most useless there with just one hand. he's also supposed to be on his country rotation in five weeks. will he have to go there, unable to drive himself?  i wish i could fly over and be there for the boy. however, unless he gets surgery, it doesn't really make much sense. - i offered it, we discussed it, but i couldn't be there for the whole time he heals so what use would i be?  he's just such a bad patient, the boy.- not just because he is a bloke and a doc. he can't rest, he gets restless when he can't work out, he pushes himself when he really shouldn't. and yeah, knowing about the risks involved with his type of fracture, he's in quite a foul mood, too.  argh. argh. argh. i so hate the limitations of ldrs in situations like these.  it's time for a care package.  more:  urlLink scaphoid fractures: frequently asked questions   urlLink the scaphoid fracture page   urlLink hand university - a patient's guide to scaphoid fractures

       hullo jack,  ya know, i wish i knew what his problem was, or really understood what's really wrong for/with him at the moment, but i don't really, and it's been hard for me to really get what's up with him.  the short version is that he finds being in an ldr very  "difficult"  at the moment.  it started on sunday, when he told me he had been thinking about whether this was all worth it, whether he should step out of this relationship.  that happened after a phone conversation the day before during which i kinda flipped at him. i had tried to get hold of him for a while (we had arranged to talk at a certain time, during which i was at the airport, dropping off my parents), and when i finally got through to him, he told me he didn't want to speak even for a minute, because he was out and about, his food was on the way, and bla-bla-blah, - stuff which i found a bit insulting, because he was out with another girl. i wasn't asking for an hour long confessional while he was in a bar, all i had wanted was a minute with him, connecting, nothing more, because i had missed our arranged phone time. he later said he was sorry for being mean, but didn't fail to mention that my reaction had been like that of his psychotic ex, jen.  reason i flipped was because it just pushed all my  "i am not a priority for him"  buttons. - the recurring issue with us, really. in any way, we talked on sunday, and it seemed like all was well again, we had said our sorries, the week had been ok, but then came his aforementioned statement, like a firm kick in the stomach. i couldn't talk for a good minute after that, and kept shaking uncontrollably. it felt like i couldn't breathe, like when i fell off the swing, and unto my back, when i was a kid.  in any way, right now, we're still together, but in a weird spot, really.  he says that he loves me, but i get the impression that what he wants right now is to be with someone who  a)  is near him;  b)  works with him; and  c) offers a relationship that's  "less complicated"  than being with me, who's far away.  you know, there are tons of people around him, that are accessible, single, smart, that work with him, hell, there's even someone living with him, that fits all this (flatmate anna), there's this other girl who he's been spending fucking amounts of time with (fiona), who he told me was seeing one of his mates, until i asked today why the bloke was never there when she and evan met up, and he told me they had just split up.  this is a recurring issue for him, too, surrounding himself with plenty of girls, because they are so good for his ego, make him so wanted and well. i thought he was over this, but maybe he isn't, after all. and then - isn't it human to enjoy company and attention?  fuck.  i guess he wants some newrelationshipenergy (TM), too, failing to recognize that all relationships take some effort once that has failed, that nothing fresh can replace what we have, our level of intinmacy, our connection and that we're basically a few metres in front of the finish line to turn this into a normal relationship, and that it would be insane to give up because of this, after everything we've managed. as much as it hurts, i know it's been good that he's been honest with me. being honest is the greatest thing you can do for someone. at least i get a chance to see the danger and maybe avert it. who knows.  i trust him when he says he hasn't fallen in love with anyone, but i think he just sees and experiences every singly day how easy it would be to have someone who can go to the pub with him, who he can screw with when he feels like it, go to the gym with, go for lunch with, who doesn't need explanations about work related matters, what have you. there are just plenty of replacements for me all around.  he's spending so much time out on quasi-dates with single female colleagues, i think he forgets how cool it is when we're together, and that these girls have nothing on me, that none of those fucking dates are anything close to what we have, that nothing anyone can give him is as grande as what we can have together and have had in the past.  and yeah, this all just fucking hurts.  to top this off, what has been crawling into my head has been that he's done this before, leave someone (who was far away) for someone else. he left psychotic ex for me, after all, over the phone.  i just don't feel like i can trust him, or that i can rely on him right now, when i really urgently need it. at the same time, he says he needs me, but i don't see what more i can do, don't understand what exactly he wants. it's like he's opened the door and is just pondering for a sec when exactly he wants to step out.  he's said some fucking hurtful things, too. i told him that he should be aware that if he decided to leave me via the phone, i'd be on the next fucking plane i could get on, that i wasn't going to let him do this without face-to-face contact. he replied to that that this made him consider leaving me even more, simply because he knows seeing me will refresh his desire to keep this relationship alive. if he wants to refresh our relationship, he should simply buy a fucking plane ticket and come over. he could at least fucking book for when he wanted to come over in july.  other fucked up thing was that he said leaving me wouldn't mean he didn't love me, and that he might want to return to this relationship, after all. this is the most fucking egoistic thing i have ever heard from him. if he loves me, he will work on this relationship, as we've done before. if he doesn't, then he should leave. there is no combo of the two, no love but still leave. it's bullshit reasoning that's supposed to make it hurt less, but it just makes it all worse. in my book, you love someone, you stay with them, and commit yourself. you don't make an easy exit, just because you feel like it right now because it's  "so difficult" . pardon me, it just isn't  "more difficult"  than it's been before. it's easy. he's got a job, he's got money, i will graduate, i am not out of my mind depressed (at least i wasn't until sunday), i will move, it will be sweet, or at least we'll know whether this is real or not. so what's this fuck all about?  i really hope all this is  "just another bump in the road"  that will pass and all will be well again, but i've got this awful feeling that it isn't, and that things are coming to an end. it feels terrible to think and write this.  since sunday, i feel like someone is constantly and simultaneously choking me and kicking me in the stomach. can't eat (and when i can, i overeat, yeah.), can't speak, can't listen to fucking music or the fucking radio, can't do anything at all. can't meditate. can't practise yoga. can't talk to anyone about it (have avoided the phone for that reason, and when i've talked about this with my mom, it sparked hour long sobbing). i walk around in a fucking daze, trying to function.  it's been very testing to talk this through with him, too. i have all this things i want to know, stuff i want to understand, but i don't want to keep pushing this again and again. it hurts to feel so insecure about this, hurts that i asked him whether i can rely on him and he didn't reply (now, that's a new kind of "no", isn't it?).  at the same time, i don't know how the trust can come back, what he could do to make things better again, aside from booking that flight, maybe, and designating time for us to talk.  i'm very well aware that if he wants to end this, he will, and should, and that if that happens, i will have to let him go and wish him well. but it hurts, it just hurts so much. he says that we're in crisis, and i have no idea, no understanding where this comes from, out of the blue, out of the middle of bliss we had when i left 5 weeks ago. i am planning emigration and he's  "forgetting"  what it's like when we're together? isn't that a prime reason to end the planning, asap?  i'm terribly scared. if the mere thread of this ending bowls me over like this, what will it feel like and what should i do if he decides he doesn't want to have this any longer? all my life plans are bound to this man, to moving into his country and living there. what if he doesn't want me any more?  sorry for this whining, jack (but then, you asked for it). it's all just awful, awful, awful, and i have no idea what to do, besides trying to establish gentle communication, not pressuring him (which is hard, when all i crave is promises and stability), carefully making plans for july (which we started today), talking about what it's like when we're together.  and yeah, you've got a secure spot on the waiting list for the position of "commonwealth man in caro's life". at least canada would be closer, plus you can fly, too, what a bonus.  so, any great input, chap? thanks for listening, btw. muchly appreciated.   love, caro (needing prozac, hugs and stability)    post scriptum: felt like noting all this stuff here, just not like writing it in an artistic way. what for? sugarcoat my pain? no thanks. i'm going to a yoga class at a sivananda center in essen tomorrow morning, and really do not know whether that's a good idea or not. i don't want to unleash the emotions nicely locked up inside (if not far from the surface - close enough for stupid music on the radio to break through to them) and know that might happen. umph.

        urlLink friday five   1. what is your favorite type of literature to read (magazine, newspaper, novels, nonfiction, poetry, etc.)?  i read pretty much everything that gets into my hands, and being a bookshop owner's daughter(and currently even the person in charge of said bookshop), that's a lot of material of all different origins. right now, i'm in a bit of a novel phase and reading through several year's worth of man booker prize shortlists and winners. i get other phases though, too - weeks when i read nothing but biographies, or poetry or whatever else, and am an avid newspaper reaer, when there's a good newspaper at hand (like  urlLink the age ).   2. what is your favorite novel?   urlLink all these listed here , and more.   3. do you have a favorite poem? (share it!)  again, it's not just one fave, and even with my favourite poets, i never have just one favourite by each of them, i enjoy plenty of poets and plenty of their works for plenty of different reasons. it's impossible and quite ignorant in my opinion to compare late goethe's poetry with that of his earlier days, or erich fried, rilke or kästner (even though i love almost his entire "lyrische hausapotheke") - and pick a fave. there's a  urlLink list of some favourite poets right here , though.   4. what is one thing you've always wanted to read, or wish you had more time to read?  there isn't anything out there that i really urgently need to read or that i#ve put off reading for ages. if i want something, i get it, and read it, even if i have to make time for it.   5. what are you currently reading?  i am re-reading "the fellowship of the ring" by tolkien (which has been really enjoyable again so far), "practical lessons in yoga" by sri swami sivananda, a book on family relationships that my therapist recommended (whose english title i can't come up with right now) and the current edition of  urlLink yoga journal , which is the first paper one that i ever purchased - it's only available at airport bookshops, and costs a whopping 11 Euro (twice the US cover price).

        "You guys have been out there all this time?" A few of the women looked at him nervously and nodded, but I spoke. "Yes, for a few hours," I said, and met his eyes, shivering under my coat. "Aren't you cold?" he said and put his hand on my upper arm. He was incredibly handsome and had a strong, but gentle hand that engulfed my shoulder. "Yes," I said, "It's supposed to be a spring scene and I can't stop shivering." "Aw," he said, and put his arm around me, then patted me on the back and gave me a playful, but firm shove, "Well get in there!" "I will," I said, and continued on my course to warmness.

      i was sad this afternoon, after phone discussions with evan. it felt like he listened and understood what i was saying, and what it meant, for the first time in months.  i wasn't fighting the sadness and the grief (because that's what it was, really), but letting them be, and that was good. i was starting to wonder whether i had turned all fatalistic and cold. - so i havent.  the day made a turn for the better through yoga and dinner with the yoga people afterwards, a rigo with tina and emails. it was so good to sit down over food with 3 other people, and talk, be listened to, understood, - and liked, even with flaws.  i am amazed by it, and feel blessed. i haven't had this in so long. how could i ever do without a support net?  claudia (whos not regularly at yoga, because shes a stewardess) is apparently in a similar situation, also kicked off by her partner, who is now amazed, too, by what he started off, and she said some wise things. lots along the lines that  there are no bad decisions, just decisions which have both good and bad aspects about them, but she thinks making a decision is always good. i think i agree with her. other stuff she she said showed she had listened to me and noted things i had said in the past. the first time i was ever at dinner with everyone after yoga, i had told them i was going to emigrate, and had said  "but please try to get to know me nonetheless, yes?" , as if it was a joke, even though i was damn serious. and claudia mentioned that today. smart woman, this one.  in any way, it was good, the yoga, and all that talking, and it looks like well be doing a big fat, drunken, dancing girls night out this weekend. which i havent done in way too long. when he left, ralf told me he wouldnt mind me not going to australia - hed prefer having me hang around. which is good to hear, and much needed.  it sounds all hippie, but no matter what, it will be, and it will be good. this doesn't mean waiting to see what happens, - to me, it means making decisions, in the good knowledge that no matter what, it will be alright.

        working with changes   let's try an experiment. pick up a coin. imagine that it represents the object at which you are grasping. hold it tightly clutched in your fist and extend your arm, with the palm of your hand facing the ground. now if you let go or relax your grip, you will lose what you are clinging onto. that's why you hold on.  but there's another possibility: you can let go and yet keep hold of it. with your arm still outstretched, turn your hand over so that it faces the sky. release your hand and the coin still rests on your open palm.  you let it go.  and the coin is still yours, even with all this space around it.  so there is a way in which we can accept impermanence and still relish life, at one and the same time, without grasping.  let us now think of what frequently happens in relationships. so often it is only when people suddenly feel they are losing their partner that they realize that they love them. then they cling on even tighter. but the more they grasp, the more the other person escapes them, and the more fragile the relationship becomes. so often we want happiness, but the very way we pursue it so clumsy and unskillful that it brings only more sorrow. usually we assume we must grasp in oder to have that something that will ensure our happiness. we ask ourselves: how can we possibly enjoy anything if we cannot own it? how often attachment is mistaken for love?  even when the relationship is a good one, love is spoiled by attachment, with its insecurity, possessiveness and pride; and when love is gone, all you are left to show for it are the "souvenirs" of love, the scars of attachment.  sogyal ringpoche: "the tibetan book of living and dying"

      have i mentioned dirk before? i think i haven't.  he chatted me up at the laundromat three weeks ago, as i was burning a few cd compilations for a guy. we discussed cd compilations and their meanings and effects and it was quite enjoyable. - he was smart and well educated and interesting and while i am not out there looking for dates, i am looking for more connections round here nonetheless and that day, i was in a splendid mood and enjoying myself. i asked him whether he wanted a copy of what i was burning then (back then, i thought the compilations i had just made didn't have a message. but boy, was i wrong.) but he declined, getting all morally worked up about those compilations being for one guy, and that it would simply be wrong if he had them, too, because of the message, and no, he just couldn't have that, it would be like betraying the guy who was getting them in the first place. so thanks, but no thanks.  of course, i said  "now: i could burn a compilation especially for you, too."   and it wasn't just said to make him go away, even though i wanted him to go away then. at that point of the conversation, we were downstairs where the washing machines are and he was interestedly watching me fold up my undies. hm. yes, these are my g-strings and my socks, and that's my sports bra, yes.  so he said yes to my offer, and i made a little compilation for him yesterday. it's a chilly kind of summery thing, with lots of loungey dj stuff. - no deep messages this time, just plain old summer time enjoyment. kruder & dorfmeister and thievery corporation and remixed shirley bassey and lots more. it's nice, i like it. i send him an email yesterday informing him of his luck, and asked what he had been up to.  and he said he was struggling with preparations for his abitur. abitur being the final exams at grammar school to get a grade for university entrance. which means he is 19, or maybe (and that would be very rare) 20.  oy.    at the cradle snatcher anonymous meeting:  *caro stands up, blushing.*  "hello, my name is caro, and i accidentally, unwillingly and unknowingly picked up a teenager."

       "i ask myself often: "why is it that everything changes?" and only one answer comes back to me:  that is how life is .  (...)  in our minds, changes always equal loss and suffering. and if they come, we anesthetize ourselves as far as possible. we assume, stubbornly and unquestioningly, that permanence provides security and impermanence does not. but, in life, impermanence is like some of the people we meet in life - difficult and disturbing at first, but on deeper acquaintance far friendlier and less unnerving than we could have imagined.  reflect on this: the realisation of impermanence is paradoxically the only thing we can hold onto, perhaps our only lasting possession. it is like the sky, or the earth. no matter how much everything around us may change or collapse, they endure. say we go through a shattering emotional crisis...our whole life seems to be disintegrating. the earth is still there; the sky is still there. of course, even the earth trembles now and aain, just to remind us we cannot take anything for granted."  sogyal ringpoche: "the tibetan book of living and dying"    this book came to me with great timing, obviously.

      michael crawford, who has schizoaffective disorder, describes what it's like to live inside his head, in "living with schizoaffective disorder"  urlLink part i  and  urlLink part ii  at  urlLink kuro5hin.org . it's an impressive bit of writing, mercilessly open.  his descriptions of depression are to the point, and come close to  what mine was like for me.  the other day, i was asked what it was like for me to be depressed, and i realised i had trouble describing it, because it's been so long since the last very bad spell. it feels like my brain has erased some of the bad stuff from back then, memories of what it felt like. i can't say that i mind. it was strange to realise, thinking about depression, that i'm very much not depressed at the moment, nowhere near it, in fact, and that this is a newthing and that it just happened, the feeling better. sure, there have been these mountains of change for the better lately, but the happiness still caught me by surprise. it's still kinda startling, actually.  today is a strange day, mood wise, with a strange mindset and some sadness and worrying, - but i see it as just that, and am not scared, like i was for such a long time, that any bit of unhappiness might mark the return of the total loveless-ness depression has always been for me. these days, love, deep, real human connection provides a protective layer for my soul, putting a cushion between me and the boundless despair that erased my personality for so long.  and i'm very thankful and happy about that.

      the world feels like my oyster today.  maybe it's the energy from yesterday enhanced by nre and spring. who knows. fact is, i've been cleaning and organising all morning, throwing things away, taking things off the walls, putting pictures away. i have this unstoppable urge to re-decorate the flat, to make it simple and clean and tidy. i want different things on the walls, i want to paint these walls. i want space for a little altar and meditation spot (i think).  its quite intense now, this urge for change, in oh-so-many ways. i might almost start worrying about  urlLink hypomania  again. fact is, these past weeks have been full of new stuff, and i've been confronted with certain ideas i'd usually put off so many times, by so many different people that they start settling in. - sort of like: is this fate trying to tell me it's time for this? specifically, i wonder whether i should do a  urlLink vipassana  meditation course/retreat. could i do that? i'm not sure. i think more change is needed first. more time, too.  the times they are-a-changing.

      bliss. i'm in a state of pure & holy bliss.  the ajurvedic massage by silke this afternoon was the most beautiful non-sexual thing another person has ever done to me and my body. thinking about it, it possibly beats about 80% of sexual things done to me and my body, too. not that my sex life has been that bad, but this massage was a whole different league.  it was just what i needed, and i want more. i needed this, the touching, the smells, the physical sensation of the warm oil and the time for myself with this awesome woman who is growing to be a friend.  i loved it all.  for the first hour afterwards, i could hardly speak, so blissed out was i.  hmmmm.  i'm still practically purring.  it was such a connecting experience, both between my body and me, and between silke and me. i can not remember being touched in such a loving, caring way, ever before, just for *me*, for my pleasure and health and wellbeing. i managed to tune out of everything for the first time in weeks. i have been unable to relax and turn off my mind during yoga and meditation lately (too many mental videotapes starting as soon as my eyes closed, not that i minded them), but during this, i was filled with pure, simple enjoyment, nothing else, no worries, no thoughts. pretty much the only coherent sentence i uttered in the middle of it was  "this should be done to babies and children, so that they feel loved, and cared for and at home in their bodies right from the start" .  before the massage, i wondered whether i would be able to relax enough to give a (brandnew) friend this much access to my naked body, but i could, and could so easily. it was normal and felt right and normal and not strange at all. it's the first time a woman touched my body this extensively and it felt lovely. :) it was full of female energy, this afternoon. if women were this nice to each other's bodies, we'd all be happier, i think, and be less evil and critical towards ourselves and others. i have never experienced this kind of undivided attention to my body, ever. maybe i've done something wrong in the past, picked the wrong partners, maybe (most had, in fact, body hate & dysmorphia issues that could easily measure up to mine or even topped them), but this was new, and this being done to me by a woman made it even more special.  the 4 hour glory started after tea and chatting with a head and face massage using an ajurvedic paste that smelled like sandalwood. after a few minutes, i totally dropped out and enjoyed the sensations. - there's something about getting your eyebrows gently kneaded and your earlobes tucked that makes all thougths go away.  the full body massage with a warm oil mix consisting of sesame and a mix from the hospital in kerala, that smelled a bit like molasse, started sitting, which took some getting used to. it was just new that someone massaged my arms and legs while i was sitting up straight and naked apart from a g-string (which by the end of the massage had completely soaked up the oil, too). i got used to it quickly though, and by the time i went to lie on my back, and silke started massaging my belly and breasts and arms and legs and feet - just everything on me, i had tuned out and was just blissful. next came lying on my right side, lying on the belly, lying on the left, then sitting up again. the massage was firm but not rough, with long strokes, and constant contact. it took more than 2 hours. 2 hours! not that i looked at any watches.  i tried to come up with a metaphor for what it felt like, but i couldn't. i have never ever had anything close to this. i was completely drenched in the nicely smelling and feeling oil, my hair soaked up some of it, too, and i *connected* to my body, while my mind turned itself off as silke was touching me. i'm still lacking words to describe it. when the massage was over, silke padded the oil off, wrapped me in a piece of cloth and ran a bath for me, in which i soaked for a little while and washed off the oils. in the bath, i finally woke up again, in a way, the mental videotape coming back, as i realised being this oiled had a sexual quality to it, too.  overall, it was so unique, so nice, to let someone treat me this well. so very very good, too.  after the bath, and dressing (had to go commando under the denim skirt, because the g-string was just too oily) i had to drink a herbal drink that would further the positive effects of the treatment (straight from the kerbala hospital again, where she studied). silke and i had some more yogi tea, and chatted about life, and relationship and plans, and i borrowed some books and it was just overall nice. i hope we can further our friendship, silke and i. i want her in my life because she's so reflective, smart, strong and caring and positive. i will do my best.  i'd like try to get this kind of massage regularly now, maybe every 6 to 8 weeks. it has been so good for both my mind and psyche already, i can not wait to see what i feel like tomorrow. it was a strange week for me, body wise, with being so very tired because of staying up late (self-induced) and being unable to sleep in, and feeling sluggish and unhealthy while at the same time being overly active and almost manic because of nre. it's gone now the strange feeling (not the nre though, thankfully!), even though i know i will sleep well later. very well, i might add. unless i suddenly feel the urge to pick up the phone, which migth happen, after all.  oh, life is good. no, actually it's fucking brilliant.  *purrr* *purrr*

       "i'm getting in touch these days because i want to, not because i feel like i have to...and that feels better to me." , he writes.   i wrote back that that was nice, but that he shouldn't expect me to give him a medal for that: i was taking that for granted, getting in touch when it's wanted, not because of whatever outside force.  he wanted me to do less: call less, want less, need less, plan less, and so i did all that, did everything he wanted, and now he's happier and feels better.  i became reactive and constricted myself. needless to say, that was not very *me*, any of that. now i go out again, meet people, don't sit by the phone, just like he told me to, and he's surprised when i am not around when he calls, when i am busy, when i am not angry because he hasn't made an effort to get in touch in how many days.  the power games are working. in unexpected ways, and i guess with consequences he never thought about when suggesting them.  after forcing myself to do less, i now *am* less. i need less, want less, feel the need to be there less, have given up planning. it's all less. a lot less.  i wonder how he can feel happier, with so little of me.

      i declared today to be a no-work-day. oh, the luxuries of law school life. the work is still there, obviously, and will need to be looked after tomorrow and over the weekend, but today, i just can not work. i tried, and failed, because the urge to rest my hot forehead on the cool cover of my schoenfelder (a law text book), became too strong.  i'm just too tired. of these past 48 hours, only 7 1/2 were spent sleeping: 3 hours tuesday night, a blissful half an hour nap wednesday afternoon, barely 4 hours wednesday night.  in short: i'm sleepfucked. not so much that i'm hallucinating (which has happened before), but the world is warm and hazy and seems awfully demanding. it's a hang-overed kind of feeling. - even though in those 48 hours i had only 3 rigos, plus one radler, which is more than the recommended intake for a woman of my size and age, i guess, but not enough to make me feel hungovered. i look the hangovered/sleepfucked part, too. everyone i met yesterday commented on me looking pale & tired, seeming out of it and less sparkly than usual, and asked what was up. to some, i talked a bit about why i stayed up late, and left out other bits about what happened when i stayed up late, but i smiled about both.  because sleepfucked or not, i'm happy. out of my head happy, and right now, i don't have any reason to believe that that's going to change any time soon. which is a shocker, too. - happiness of this scale hasn't been a part of this life for a good long while.  so today, i'll be lazying around, writing, doing yoga tonight, sitting in the sun on my balcony, and overall walllowing in happiness, good stuff and thoughts that make my insides tingle.  it feels teenage. but i love it.

      it was a realisation while doing countless dead lifts during the back exercises of a body pump class yesterday:  there's eternal common sense type wisdom and life help in the songs of  urlLink right said fred , and they encourage self-esteem, dropping labels, trusting in feelings.  don't believe me? read their lyrics closely.   self-esteem, self worth & achieving goals:  stand up (for the champions)    "i was built to be the best number one and nothing less leave me to my destiny i have waited patiently i have vision' oh i believe i know i can count on me  (...)  it's just life that's how it is cause we have our strength and weaknesses  and when i fall down i have to pick myself back up"      trusting in feelings:  i know what love is    "there ain't a quick fix to a slow heartbreak  there ain't a good feeling in a bad mistake  but i know when it feels right   i know what love is what love is what love is  and i know what love is like  there ain't another song like avalon  when the lights are off to turn you on  i know what love is like   love is like a bed i make it every day  love is like a breeze that blows you away  love is like a wish and love is like song  love is like a thought that spins you along  i know what love is like"      feeling good and desirable in your own skin:  i'm too sexy    i'm too sexy for my shirt too sexy for my shirt so sexy it hurts and i'm too sexy for milan too sexy for milan new york and japan and i'm too sexy for your party too sexy for your party no way i'm disco dancing  i'm too sexy for my car too sexy for my car too sexy by far and i'm too sexy for my hat too sexy for my hat what do you think about that      friend- & mateship:  you're my mate    "i'll tell you what i think i think she's a cow she's let you down too many times now let's go for a drink forget it for now put it behind you i think it's your round coz you're my mate and i will stand by you you're my mate and i will stand by you and in the face of things that could hurt you you're my mate and i will stand bye you  i'll tell you what i think i think he's a pain he ain't got a car but he drives you insane let's go for a drink and sink a few enough about him let's talk about you coz you're my mate and i will stand by you you're my mate and i will stand by you and in the face of things that could hurt you you're my mate and i will stand bye you"      quitting talking when it's all been said:  don't talk just kiss    "ooh yeah, there's people there's love you and i both apply to the above the one and only reason is fun fun fun well baby, we've only just begun  don't talk just kiss we're beyond words and sound don't talk just kiss let your tongue fool around let's fool around"    he. :)

      i'm back home, and i'm happier than ever before about having my life back.  it was a very much up-and-down kinda time with the parents (himmelhochjauchzendzutodebetruebt), and it was exhausting. exhausting because i could not recharge my batteries with good stuff (like letters, and yoga, and booze with tina), exhausting because of the criticisim, exhausting because it was so much family, all at once, asking questions i neither wanted nor needed, because they circled like birds of prey around things i am so unsure about. like thefuture. and evan. and thefuturewithevan.  at the same time, i was (and still am) on a constant high, caused by a variant of nre, which is sweet and mind-numbing and over-stimulating and exciting and confusing and saddening. it is the latter because of what might result out of it, what it makes me wonder and think about, what decisions i should be in the process of making instead of enjoying the nre so much, being so turned on, so smitten by what turns up in my (hot)mail.  i'm meeting daniel again tonight, too, which shall be interesting. i will have all my guards up. - life is all messy and confusing (and wonderful, too) enough already. no need to make it even more so, but he *is* interesting, and i need people around and so i will be out tonight, hopefully enjoying myself, possibly coming home needing a big fat drink in front of the computer again like last week and writing drunken eMails. it's overwhelming and fucking awesome,  this being so very much attracted to someone. that someone is not daniel, i might add. meeting daniel (i am avoiding calling this a date), is a symptom of things being wrong, and it has a slight taste of revenge, too. of the  "he does that, so i can do that, too" -variety. which is wrong, and feels wrong, but i still do it. which in itself says a million things already.  got stuff to do: need to unpack further, need to go shopping for groceries and eat (or if I don't eat, i might be incoherent and silly by 9:30), need to write some mail, need to shower because 5 hours on a train full of dutch pensioners make me feel yucky, need to... enjoy myself tonight.  will do all that.

      i'm at the parents.  my mother welcomed me on wednesday with compliments on my weight loss, and the suggestion that the only thing needed to perfect me now was liposuction on my hips. thank you, mother.  she didn't get how horrible her suggestion was, and how upset and hurt i have been and still am, because she keeps commenting on parts about my body she deems wrong and faulty, and needing fixing. i got rather loud with her this morning, when she told me to look at her at the breakfast table, and then proceeded to advise me that my eyebrows were "overplucked". she started sulking after i told her i neither wanted nor needed her criticism.  today being a public holiday, the parents and i drove to holland for some shopping (a family ritual on good friday), and my father tried to calm the atmo by buying me a printed marc aurel shirt i loved, but could not afford. i wish he had better ways of showing support for me. you know, like talking.  despite that, i'm well. very well. all is still strange and good and changing and awesome, and i love it. it's so exciting, this life thing!

      life things have changed, in subtle ways, and i like it a lot.  i had a non date on monday, with daniel, an ashtanga teacher who's running a class i am interested in. it was fun: i was attracted to him, quite violently (i felt like licking each and ever freckle on his slender body), even though he really isn't "my type", whatever that is anyway. however, what remained after the shared coffee was the realisation that there's someone else who i'd much prefer having had coffee with, and kissing on the cheek afterwards.  last night after yoga, tina and i sat on the balcony drinking rigos, kristofer astrom crooning the 11 minute glory that "you don't know how good you are" is. the moon came up over the roofs, bats were flying, and we mostly sat in silence, being awed by the evening sky and the changing lights and the cathedral and martin's gate iluminated for night.  i haven't been happier in years, even though life is so in flux, so confusing right now. nothing seems sure or secure right now, and as unbelievable as that is, it feels good: no matter what will be, it will be, and it'll be good.

      i fell in love today.  i was browsing the racks of my favourite cd store, when a song they played struck *something* in me, hit a nerve, a feeling, that was so intense i literally stormed to the bloke at the cash register, who helped me try to figure out what song it was, and bought the cd.  i fell in love with  urlLink kristofer astrom's  voice and singing. the cd is "leaving songs" and each and every one of them is a piece of fucking brilliance, which hits what i feel, way too well. creepy. but fucking awesome.  music to listen to at night, in summer, on a deck out towards the forest, drinking wine, in the company of someone you intensely like. the waiting list for that position is open. any applications?  now off for the non-date. or something. what an interesting day so far.

      the pro-lifers were on the main pedestrian mall again yesterday. just like the day before.  it's unusual to see them out on the streets round here. this is germany: the big old abortion debate is settled, has been settled, for a decade. sorry, seems it me that you've missed these latest development. you can pack up those 30 year old colour photos of saline abortions and go now. oh, and don't forget the little plastic foetuses.  a bit more than 10 years ago, there was much turmoil about abortion. the german democratic republic had completely unregulated abortion: you wanted one, you got it, -at least within the first trimester. the federal republic of germany had abortion under "indications", reasons that made abortion permissible. those included -among others- a "criminal", "medical" as well as a "social" indication, which obviously enabled every woman to get an abortion if desired. after much debate, parliament decided that while abortion should be a criminal offence, it will not be prosecuted if it happens within the first trimester, and after unbiased pregnancy crisis counselling three days before the procedure. so while abortion is technically illegal, and while it can be awfully difficult for women in the country to get pregnancy crisis counselling (especially since the catholic church disallowed catholic counselling services to offer pregnancy crisis counselling for abortion purposes), it works reasonably well, planned parenthood and even the women's group on the furthest of the left have stopped campaigning for completely unregulated abortion: germany is still a highly christian country, - it just won't happen.  when i saw those pro-lifers for the first time on friday, realising who they were, and what they were doing, and which pictures they were showing, i felt rage rise inside me.  they had the full deal, you know? the plastic foetuses. those posters of bloody, cut up foetuses. that picture of tiny foetal feet between adult fingers. a cardboard tombstone for the dead babies. references to genocide. the usual propaganda. they were well organised. they had one of the best spots the town rents to people who want to put up stalls in the pedestrian mall. organised they were, those pro-lifers.  on friday, an old man offered me a pamphlet, and all i could say, in passing, was  "no, i don't need your propagandistic lies, thank you."   yesterday, coming out of migros, i was tempted to argue with them, all looking so holy when approaching passer-bys (and there were many. this is a major town, at noon on a saturday), especially young girls. i was very tempted, actually.  i wasn't just tempted because i wanted to challenge the misinformation they were spreading. not just because most people at the stall were middle-aged men who apparently feel more of a right to decide about my body than me. not just because of the goriness of the propaganda in which they wallowed. not just because i wanted to tear apart their pseudo-arguments. not just because of their sorrow-filled, mournful eyes.  you know why? i thought about a woman i know from gym.  i haven't seen her since december. she was a bit more than 3 months pregnant back then. when she first told me she was pregnant, in early november, she told me she hadn't wanted to get pregnant, but now it had happened, she was happy and excited and wholeheartedly wanted the kid, her second. she started to show very early, and we talked about her pregnancy a lot, when under the showers after our workout. because she's already in her late 30's, in late november, she had an amniocentesis that she had been scared about for 6 weeks prior. after not seeing her for 2 weeks after the amniocentesis, i remember the sunday morning we met at the gym in early december, shortly before i went off to australia. the minute i saw, her, i knew something wasn't okay. and i was right. the amniocentesis had had an okay result, but the ultrasound which they did at the same time, had not been okay.  the baby had been diagnosed with  urlLink congenital diaphragmatic hernia , a hole in the diaphragm through which the internal organs move into the chest cavity, preventing normal growth of the lungs. she had started to show so early, because she had polyhydramnios, too much amniotic fluid; a common complication when the baby has cdh. she told me she had been told the prospects were grim at best and that she'd have to wait another three weeks, till the first week of january, for another ultrasound. that ultrasound would show whether there was hope the defect could be surgically dealt with after birth, or whether it was so severe that the baby would be born without any lungs at all. in case of the latter diagnosis, she and her husband had decided to terminate the pregnancy. - at the time of the second ultrasound, she would have been 19 weeks along.  she was heartbroken, but bravely talking about it, and about how she was trying to not think at all, to not worry at all, to distract herself by preparing christmas with her daughter. i was shocked and heartbroken, too, unable to find the right words to say. i kept looking at her belly, trying to imagine what it must be like for her to be pregnant, being unsure whether she would still be pregnant three weeks from now. we had talked about her amniocentesis before; she was sure she could not handle a disabled child. i was weary, and during our discussions i realised that right now i don't think i could ever choose a late term abortion based on a disability for myself. i hope that whenever i decide to become a mother, i will accept my child as it is - disabled, as well. how would i feel, what would it mean if i terminated a pregnancy because the kid has down's syndrome? i know so many people with down's who lead such happy, fulfilling lives...  in any way, i thought about her when seeing the gruesome images the pro-lifers had on show. i haven't seen her since december, no one at the gym has. i thought about her lots while i was in australia, sending good thoughts her way, hoping all would be well. it might mean all turned out as best as possible, the defect hadn't worsened in those three weeks, and she's still pregnant right now, preparing for the birth and doubtlessly complicated aftermath and hence not working out. it could however, just as well mean that all was as bad as it looked, that she terminated in early january, and can't face all who had commented on her pregnancy in gym. i don't know.  if she has terminated, i wonder what she would have felt seeing those images at the pro-lifer's stall. i wondered whether those self-righteous middle aged men gave a damn about women like her, about women at all, women who had to make a decision they really didn't want, never wanted to make in the first place i wonder whether they really think that a woman ever has an abortion, "just because", light-heartedly. they all obviously have never seen the women in the waiting room at planned parenthood, waiting for their appointments for pregnancy crisis counselling. i saw them, every day i volunteered, sometimes looking after their kids, reading out to them, while the women were talking to susan. they were diverse, those women, of all ages, all social groups, some very much like me, others completely different. what united them was that they were all scared, all worried, pale, unsure. none of them was elated or happy about the decision they were about to make, but all at least had the chance to make that decision for themselves.  how can those middle aged man be serious about wanting to take that choice away from them? why do they think they have the right to force a woman to give birth to a child that will not survive because of a physical defect, or to give birth to a child when their life situation just does not allow for a child at the moment?  i don't get it.  i walked past their stall, feeling the rage, but not the energy to tell them the story of the woman at gym, the women in the waiting room at planned parenthood, how great choice is, and what a great tool the "lord" they so praise has given us: the mind, a mind to make decisions with. i looked at them all, at their propaganda, briefly, - and walked past.  i don't want to walk past them, silently, ever again, the more i think about it. and i won't.

       urlLink something for kate  will be in germany next month. i'm in shock.  they'll be  supporting  -and it pains me to write this-  urlLink silverchair . yes, something is wrong about that, indeed. the two concerts on german soil are far away (hamburg and berlin), but that would have been manageable, i would have travelled to hamburg; much worse: they are sold out.  hundreds of unworthy germans will get to see and hear mr.dempsey, and it won't mean a thing to them. and i, something for kate's most devout fan in mainland europe, won't be there to stand in the first row, look him in the eyes and silently lip-synch every single line of every single song.  duh.  the sfk website promises touring in the uk in late may, early june. - maybe i can sneak off to see the brother in london *and* mr. depsey at the same time? hmmmm.

      my mother told my 92 year old grandmother today, that klaus died. first my grandma expressed sadness about his death because he was so young (63). then she said the following, obviously finding comfort in it.   "he was a good catholic, and believed in god and in heaven, so i am sure he is in heaven now. and of course, he had a lot of money, too, so he'll have the most beautiful, most expensive coffin."

       urlLink fridayfive    1. what was the first band you saw in concert?  it was october 1991, it was the phillipshalle in duesseldorf, and the band was roxette, who i didn't even like very much when the concert came along. less than a year later, in june 1992, i made up for roxette by seeing u2 for the first time, in dortmund. it was a religious experience.   2. who is your favorite artist/band now?  i never had, and never will have just one favourite musical artist or band. the first that come to mind right now are those i've listened to these last few days: something for kate, the notwist, the whitlams, serge gainsbourg, robbie williams, u2.   3. what's your favorite song?  again, i never had, and never will have just one favourite song. today, the song i keep putting on repeat is jasmin tabatabai's "absence makes the heart beat". this week, i've also been particularly attracted to "no aphrodisiac" by the whitlams and "the scientist" by coldplay. earlier in the week, i burned some compilation cds, and all those songs have been with me all week, and i haven't grown tired of them yet.   4. if you could play any instrument, what would it be?  the piano. it's so smart, and sexy and seductive. in a perfect world, i could play it like keith jarrett. *sigh*   5. if you could meet any musical icon (past or present), who would it be and why?  bono. if he's busy saving the third world, i'd settle for john lennon.

      one of my dad's best friends died late last night, after  urlLink being very sick  for a whole year. he is the first in my dad's group of friends to die, and that's why his death hits awfully close to home.  he was hard-working, and hard. he was highly focused, and merciless sometimes. he had a successful career, a marriage that lasted 39 years until his death, three kids and three grandchildren. he was a devout catholic who believed in heaven. he always wanted to be first with everything, he was the first to start playing golf, the first to have a driver, the first to have a million in the bank, now he is the first to die.  i hope you're resting peacefully,  urlLink klaus .

      the phone rang at 7am this morning.  it was the boy: he booked a flight and will arrive in frankfurt at 5:55am on the 17th of july. he has three weeks holidays, and will be round here for two. he'll be out in the country hospital till then, and hence apparently can not leave on his last day of work, or the next for that matter, and hence also wants 3 days back in Australia before starting work. two weeks is a very short time to be together, especially for us. especially right now. in addition to that, experience has shown that the boy needs that amount of time to get used to us being together to start with.  he told me i should thank his best mate santa who apparently "talked him into booking" monday night by giving him the exact same reasons i've given these past weeks.  knowing this makes it all quite anti-climactic. why does my opinion not count? why does he need to be "talked into" this in the first place? am i not enough of a reason? does he even want to come here? i have doubts. - have had them ever since the meltdown. i wonder whether they will ever go away. can i trust him, ever again?  i should be happy and excited, but this feeling of sadness and dissapointment is here instead. and that's just strange.       absence makes the heart beat  ~jasmin tabatabai~  all this time i kept wondering dearly where you'd go and how you are never knowing how to think clearly never cared whether you're too far never thinking that the world might spin too fast for i keep hanging on  nothing there to wonder if to last cause you might just move one don't look up always look back cause i guess absence makes the heart beat  just look up never look back if you wish that we'll ever meet  after a while something's creeping up slowly you keep moving and i stand still try forgetting not to be so lonely i try moving and you keep still just afraid that the world might spin too fast cause i keep hanging on sometimes knowing that there's nothing left to last while you might just move on

      i'm at the laundromat, burning cd compilations. it's such a tricky, delicate task.  you know, i'm a  urlLink kassettenmaedchen  as defined by  urlLink benjamin von stuckrad-barre  in the short story of the same name from 1996. have always been, will always be. however, every once in a while i've been on the other side of the tape making thing, too, and made attempts at doing bait-type mixes to lure boys i liked. frank is in posession of the best one i ever made. and thorsten just taped mine over, the idiot. however, generally speaking, while i enjoy mixing stuff for people i like, i'm far more comfortable at the receiving end, being a true kassettenmaedchen.  it's so stressful, preparing a cd or tape for someone, especially for a perfectionist like me.  song selection! song order! the eternal question: are two songs by one artist on one compilation okay? is there an exception from the rule if they are from different albums? is there an exception when two songs are sung by the same singer, but were published solo and with band? what message does this thing have? do i want this to have a message at all? what should the ratio between comfortably old and possibly known (and maybe hated?) and fresh new stuff be? will the recipient be able to handle a song by serge gainsbourg? is this whole thing not terribly boring? don't those songs all sound the same? isn't this more about me then about finding music the recipient will like? what if the recipient hates this?  compiling a cd or a tape is very personal. a bit like undressing in front of a soon to be bed partner for the first time, when you're not sure (s)he's loving you enough already to not care about the not so perfect body bits. or like telling a deep dark secret in a very fresh friendship. the scary part is, that i won't be even in the room (or on the same continent, for that matter) when this cd is being listened to, and i won't see first hand whether any songs will be fast forwarded or skipped or whether there'll be cringing action at the serge gainsbourg song or maybe even at something for kate or whether this will make the recipient smile and interested in more of this.  when undressing, you can at least prepare the scene, with good lightning and easy to get out clothing and a generous amount of alcohol to be consumed before and during. with secret telling, you get both verbal and non-verbal clues from the person you're talking to, and can pull the handbrake, when you realise it's not the right time yet. but this cd compiling is one way communication, with time delay. once it's burned and send off, there's no way to change it.  eeeep!

      i'm happy, you know?  it's strange, how i suddenly noticed that it's here, this happiness, and how it has sticked around for days now. i'm not used to this.  sure, not everything is perfect right now, some stuff is far from, actually, but this strange acute happiness syndrome has lasted through a massive hangover, a session with dr.k, study related stresses, boy stresses, time flying by and me getting maybe half the stuff done i need to get done (but maybe that's just because i'm enjoying myself, who knows), a few things that aren't usually that good. so it's still here, this happiness, and that just fuckin' rocks.  you know, it's friends that make me so happy. i've realised again that starting up, and deepening and developing friendships is a bit (and sometimes exactly) like having a crush. not only do you get some newrelationshipenergy(TM), you're also anxiously trying to figure out whether there might actually be *something* of substance after all. or whether that substance is still there.  i can't put into words what i missed these years, with tina and me seperated and without contact. in a way, we picked our friendship up where we left it. i realised the other day, that we are so similar in some regards that it hurts. while we've not worked through everything that went bad then and are still sometimes tripping around issues, and while it's sad that it took us so long to get back to what we've got, there's not a moment of regret we didn't catch up earlier, but an allcovering happiness about us having reconciled. and it's good. i needed a galpal here.  there's another not so brand-new friendship that's lately been deepening with novel-like emails which are exhausting to write, but feel fabulous to send off and receive. they make me awfully happy, too, even when those novels are sad and make me wish to give his 7-year-old-self a big fat squeeze and tell him he should hit back, and that even if he won't, all will be fine in 15 years, and he'll get through alright and be a rockin' kind of bloke. it's all very good, and i feel very much cared for, and that rocks.  then there's kathrin, who i met at gym yoga. we've been chatting, and to the sauna, and we met both yesterday and today to work out, which has been good. with her, i'm most curious whether we have more in common than just our interest in yoga and the same gym. we're in two quite different spots, admittingly: she's from the former east, and i'm west; she's married (nice hubbie!), i'm partnered (and in turmoil, still); she's a physio, i study (and she's got awful respect for that, which she just shouldn't); she's trying to conceive and i'm nowhere near that. nonetheless it's been cool so far: we're both willing, and interested, and we'll see. exciting!   there's the "boys" at the laundromat, too, just a 2 minute walk away anytime i need a free coffee, a burned cd and a few caresses for my ego. on thursday, when i unsuccessfully burned a few cds there, reza (who runs the copy shop next door) came in, and proclaimed me the ideal woman every man wanted. i told him it was just because of my curves and muscly roundness, and padded my thigh. to that he quickly jumped over to my computer and admiringly weighed and padded my thigh, too. hm. i've got a good firm thigh these days. :) dieter offers more than friendship every single day anyway, but i wonder whether he wouldn't decline if i took him up on it (which i just wouldn't do, ever). marco does that, too. but i don't mind. no matter what, it's fab to be a local somewhere and to always be welcome, and it makes me feel at home in this city. -which i just haven't felt in years, actually.  and there's so many more: the yoga people, kitto and heather and brianna and some more scarleteeners, some more blog folks, like stuart (who i owe multiple emails, still) and lastly, my other tina in faraway austria, and i miss her, and can't believe i haven't seen her in 9 months, and wish her penty of good stuff, and that all will go well at tuesday's exam.  generally, i feel quite well looked after right now by my friends, and that's a feeling i haven't had in a while.  spring being here, helps, too. it popped up from nowhere, the green stuff, sometime last week, and now it's everywhere the hills around the city are brightly and violently light green, today the skies are blue, there are primroses on my balcony (yellow and pink), and while it's chilly, it's fresh and nice outside, and i realise i can't wait for summer.  further happiness is caused by plain old feeling good in my body. it's still a new thing for me sometimes, liking my body, but right now, i do, and do so muchly. this morning, kathrin, hubbie matthias and i went to a spinning class, which i hadn't done in ages. the bloke who ran it did it fabulously: we were put in groups, and chased and lead, and for a while had to imagine being  urlLink domestiques  and do a little maneuver including falling back to the team car, getting water, then pedaling all the front to the peleton to reach our team leader. 25 minutes into the class, the endorphine high kicked in. i kept imagining  urlLink tour de france  scenes, i was pedalling away full power and awfully, awfully happy for being healthy, and able to do this, and being with friends and having fun. when we had finally reached our hilltop and were on the final descend, the bloke who ran it told us to imagine a great descens, and i closed my eyes and saw and felt a perfect descend in the pyrrhenes, plenty of curves, wind, views, valleys. it was perfect, and like meditation. and as usual, by the end of an hour on the spinning bike, i was full of admiration for  urlLink lance  and every other pro rider: my bum hurts so much after this one hour, it's agony. so good no one's here to ask for sex of the intercourse kind right now, it'd be impossible. i urgently need padded pants if i want to do spinning more regularly again, to prevent serious bruising and blood flow problems to happen. oh well. it still rocked, and rocked muchly.  to end this happiness register for now, i indulged yesterday, and purchased a tub of  urlLink http://www.usa.thebodyshop.com/web/tbsus/products/us_products_detail.jsp?curr_category=TBSUS_body_body_butter&parent_category=TBSUS_body&itemID=TBSUS34557&is_mac=false">body shop mango body butter  and now smell and feel totally soft and edible and all over the body lickable, that i do wish someone was here to do just that, after all.  now i got to hurry: dinner at tina's place, and i still need to change into something presentable.  life is so bloody good right now.  (regarding happiness: leaving cnn turned off and putting the head into the desert sand for a little while, helps, too.)

      here in caroville, we're a bit tired and trying to avoid self-pity, which is so embarrasing when the reason for feeling poor has been self induced. i'm feeling great, despite being tired (as one is after 2 hours of sleep, - a 2 hour afternoon nap can't make up for a whole night, i guess) and drained by whatever is still left of this hangover of mine.   tina and i had a fabulous time last night: on top of a brillant yoga class during which i managed to do a headstand, in the middle of the room, and hold it, came episode #3 of the thornbirds, plenty of vino, and above all, lots and lots of high quality girl talk. for the uninitiated:  episode 3 is the best of the series, mainly because it's the culmination point of ralph (the priest) and meggie's relationship. and because those sex scenes were the first i ever saw on the telly i guess. and they are actually not that bad, either.  tina and i squealed with delight at some of the overly dramatic scenes and squealed some more when ralph finally breaks his vows and "turns into a real man" when he has has sex with meggie and talks about finally feeling "whole" during afterglow. awwww. you know, that's what i want, soppy, overly romantic that i am: sex as the union of two people, despite all odds.  tina and i, we had an extraordinary amount of red wine, both during and after the episode, and when the vino was gone, proceeded to salvage the last alcoholic beverages in my fridge, too, a process during which we realised that "rigo" by bacardi is nothing but a poor cocktail substitute for bogans and white trash, and a way to seduce young-uns to consume booze. we talked until about 4 in the morning, both crawled into my bed, and once we finally managed to stop talking, slept. tina for quite a while, me only until 5am, when i had to get up for a scheduled  urlLink scarleteen  staff discussion. i wonder how i managed to type coherently, but i did, and it was a fruitful, worthy discussion. i crawled back into bed and slept another hour till i had to get up for therapy. took quite a bit of effort to get going: there's a rule to not go to therapy intoxicated, so i showered till no hot water was left and until i felt i could think straight, put on make-up and started to feel at least sort-of alright again. therapy was quite okay, even though i am still not sure -as mentioned before- it's actually useful to talk about the boy at the moment, with anyone. i can't say i enjoy someone basically telling me i deserve better, and that he thinks evan is doing this because he's under too much pressure to really leave me, for an hour a week. i still got my mind set on giving the boy some slack for now, because this is a major life change for him, and wait and see what happens when he comes over in summer and then we'll take it from there. he started looking at flights this week, too. which is good.   after therapy, tina and i brunched extensively for hours at my place, and then shopped a bit and just had an overall lovely girl time, which i missed so much, both in general, and specifically with her, too. so silly that we split for 3 years, about nothing (aka a bloke). we always were each others support nets, and when we went our own ways, both crashed. here's to hoping we can get back on track together, too. not sleeping alone was nice, too, even though it was tina (aka a girl, who i like, but not in that way, most of the time), and there was hence little cuddling. no matter what, bed company is lovely, and having someone there for brekkie was, too. so all was good and splendid, and an enjoyable time was had by all. it feels like our friendship is fully back on track, which is so good for my sanity and happiness and everything.   i tried to be efficient this afternoon, but to no avail, so i went to bed, and felt good about that, too, and woke up when the boy called, which was cool, too. overall, i'm tired, and hangovered (hmmmm.. aspirin and diet coke with lemon -the best ever- is a good relief, i'm just discovering) but awfully, awfully happy and levelled and just content with life. all very much needed, that trashy tv and vino and girl talk.   now food. not because i'm terribly hungry, but because my stomach is still all fuzzy, and because an old fashioned (not terribly healthy, but great) comfort food dinner of fish fingers, new potatoes and spinach to be followed by häagen dasz macadamia nut brittle will make life even better.

       urlLink friday five .   1. how many houses/apartments have you lived in throughout your life?  6. my parent's house. the flat i shared in unitown when i first started uni. the flat in unitown where i currently live. for shorter periods of time, i've lived in my host family's house in christchurch, new zealand, evan's parent's house in melbourne and evan's new house.   2. which was your favorite and why?  while i like my parent's home, i like my current flat most: it's comfy, home, mine, centrally located, and just cool. i could do with a bath tub, though. and flatmates would be nice, too, but that's impossible here.   3. do you find moving house more exciting or stressful? why?  stressful. when moving from the shared flat into this one, we totally miscalculated the effort involved in renovating this place, and the day we had booked the moving truck, nothing was packed. my dad and i were still laying new carpet when my mom and two of my friends packed and drove my stuff here. that's never going to happen ever again.   4. what's more important, location or price?  it's a mix of both. living in the middle of the city centre right now, i know i'll find it hard to ever not life in such a great location. however, sometimes it's just not affordable. which this place thankfully is though.   5. what features does your dream house have (pool, spa bath, big yard, etc.)?  good sized yard and porches and an outdoor entertainment area wit bbq. great location in a cool neighbourhood. oversized bathtub with spa. built-in-robes. wooden floors. high ceilings. character.

      am still a bit sicklish. have had so much licorice tea and sage bons i'll throw up if i have any more. i decided to test the healing properties of some gallo zinfandel: tonight it's episode #3 of the thornbirds, and tina's coming over again to share both the wine and the movie with me, watching richard chamberlain and raquel welch consummate their love on a queensland (really though a hawaiian) beach.   my life is just way to boring, isn't it?  i should be out there screwing catholic priests (or at least my very own boy who doesn't seem to care about me, thank you very much) on beaches myself, shouldn't it?

      kitsy killed herself in the laundry.  kitsy being the previous person to rent the house evan shares with susie and anna. it happened 6 months ago and the laundry in question is *the* laundry, in *the* house. yes, the laundry that had a surprising amount of insects that seemed to come from nowhere when we first cleaned the place just before christmas. the laundry that goes off from their big kitchen.  i'm not surprised.  evan's right-hand neighbour, an adorable lady called sue, had taken me out on a guided tour through town and for lunch and coffee back in january, and had told me about the people who had lived in evan's house before. of kitsy, she had spoken in the past tense, had instructed me to give any mail for kitsy to yet another neighbour who would  "send it home to kitsy's mom in the us" , and uttered lots that basically described kitsy as a mentally ill, drug abusing woman in her thirties, who had had an abundance of problems, who couldn't look after her young son, who lived with his dad in melbourne. i can't put down what exactly made me believe kitsy had killed herself, but i just got the vibe from it all. i never asked sue outright whether kitsy had committed suicide, but the night after sue had taken me out, i told evan about my impression that kitsy had killed herself.  and indeed, she has. in the laundry.  the left-hand neighbour, a bloke i never met, saw evan yesterday and noticed his cast, and asked whether he, had fallen prey to the "spell that's on the house", which - according to him- had caused multiple broken bones, and well "then the suicide, too". so evan asked "which suicide?" and left-hand neighbour was way too happy to share the details of kitsys death. what an idiot, indeed.  it's unclear whether kitsy actually intended to kill herself or not. - she died of a drug overdose. it apparently took a few days until she was discovered, in the laundry, because she had led such an isolated life.  susie is freaked about this having happened in her house a mere 6 months ago and wants to move out now. apparently, when susie walked into the house for the first time, with the real estate agent and evan and two more friends, she didn't like it at all and felt that something was wrong about it.  fact is, i never thought the house had a particularly good vibe, either. it's a pretty place in a great location, but i wouldn't have chosen it, for the beige carpets, and the curtains and the vibe - it felt loveless, sterile, not lived in, and i had somehow gotten the impression that the departure had been very sudden and sloppy. i can't put my finger on what exactly gave me that impression... maybe the forgotten buddha in the backyard, maybe the coat hangers in the built in robes, maybe the nails in the walls. something about the house felt like someone other then the person living there had packed, which was -as it turns out- the case after all.  i specifically didn't like the kitchen on first entrance. the entire right hand side of it, the one where the laundry door is. it just didn't feel very comfortable at all, from the very first moment, when the house was still empty. - it got even worse when susie had put her ugly giant table in that part of the room. - i preferred having meals in the living room or outside. i talked about it back then, too, how it felt sterile and cold and empty.  which it did.  i always left the door to the laundry open, because the glass door from the laundry to the backyard would bring some extra light into that bad-chi corner of the kitchen. i tried to repair the broken french blinds on the laundry backyard door for even more light, but failed. in contrast to that, susie always closed the door to the laundry. in 35 degree weather, she attempted drying her clothes in the cool, closed laundry. i always dried the clothing outside in the backyard, leaving all doors open to let the sun and air (and the  urlLink spiders ) in.  probably all just coincidental, really, combined with me being sensitive to the feel of the place, nothing more.  i don't believe in ghosts, at all. never have, never will. i don't think life and death and this world function this way.  i do believe in life energy of some form, call it chi if you want. - and something about the chi of the kitchen and laundry wasn't right, who knows why. while i was there, i tried to fix whatever gave the kitchen and laundry a bad chi, not knowing what exactly was wrong. but now that i do know, what was wrong, that someone had died, and others had packed, doesn't change a thing about my feelings for the house in general. it's a bnice house in a great location, and even though i wouldn't have picked it myself, i would live there, despite the carpets, despite the curtains, despite kitsy's death.  actually i find it quite sad that there were no real markers about what had happened. about who kitsy was. there were no clues, no real leftovers of kitsy's life, apart from aforementioned buddha figure, the coat hangers and the mail and the magazines (esquire, time, shipped from the us) that kept arriving for her. the little she impacted the house, the little she impacted those around her, apparently, living in seclusion. she hardly left an imprint on those who lived around her and didn't let them. - sue apparently tried hard to connect to her but for her left-hand neighbour bloke she was apparently no one, nothing. - otherwise he wouldn't have abused her for the poor joke and an attempt to scare evan with the "spell that's on the house". how ridiculous. i googled kitsy in an effort to find out more, to no avail.  why be scared because you know someone died in the house? why be scared because it might have been suicide? the only drama about this all is how sad and depressed and alone kitsy must have been in this pretty place, in that pretty suburb, in that town, with such a great neighbour like sue next door. it's sad she either decided or by accident took too much of whatever poison was her choice. that's the entire drama of this, nothing else.  it startles me, that susie is so freaked now. if the death of a person in a certain room affects her that much, how can she even enter the hospital every day? i'm also startled that evan started talking about fear at night and ghosts. sure, i don't live in the house right now, but what's this all about? sure, the house's vibe wasn't great in my opinion, but evan always loved it, and never had a doubt about it, ever. so why now, i wonder? because of someone dying?  and i wonder whether hearing of a death that happened to someone we never knew in our home has such a shock value because we're so far removed from the beginnings and ends of life these days. we are born and we die in hospitals. anything besides that is out of order.  i'm not trying to make suicide sound like normal death. it isn't. i can wholeheartedly understand anyone instantly wanting to move out of the home where a family member killed her/himself. a schoolmate of mine found his dad in the cellar after he had shot himself in the head. a long-time friend of my mom died several years ago in a suicidal looking situation (she had been an alcoholic and had been on a binge mixed with meds and had then gotten a heart attack), naked on her kitchen floor. not wanting to live in a house or flat where someone you've loved was so desperate, so lost, is something i can understand, wholeheartedly. and as mentioned before, being human, i feel compassion for kitsy, who was so lost and desperate in her home, too, which is now evan's home. however, kitsy's death, no death ever spoils a place. plenty of people kill themselves by throwing themselves from sydney harbours south head, or jumping from melbourne's westgate bridge. - it changes people's thoughts about a place, but does not change a place, per se. whether that's good or bad is debatable. i recently read alice sebold's "the lonely bones" in which ruth feels places where women were killed...for her, passing by places where lives were ended is unbearable. i'll never forget visiting sachsenhausen concentration camp with my blind mate ben. it was a ghastly cold winter day, and the impact it had was visual, physical and emotional. i read out something for the group we were there with, and cried, because it affected me so much. ben, however, despite what i read out, despite what he knew had happened there, felt that sachsenhausen was peaceful. he couldn't see the barracks, the writings in the gate, the images of the bodies in the underground cellars. he knew they were there, touched the barracks, the ovens, but overall to him, being unable to see it, sachsenhausen felt peaceful, holy, sacred. - sachsenhausen being a  place were thousands of people were tortured, killed and burned. the atrocities had not changed the feel of the place for a blind visitor.  kitsy isn't a ghost sneaking around the house. there are no sad memories of her around, which -as i've mentioned, is sad in its own way.  i think the strangeness, the lack of flow, of chi in that part of the house (and some other areas, too) came mainly from the lovelessness of the house, caused by her death and the move arranged by others in a haste. the house still had that lovelessness after evan and susie had moved in with all that furniture they hated, with all the mixed-upness and lack of loving and care and those beige carpets and curtains. while i was there, i tried hard to get rid of it with cleaning and care and straightening, but some things, you can not change with that alone.  my flat had a lovelessness about it, too, when i first had a look at it. - the girl who lived here before me was very unhappy, got unexpectedly pregnant in here (but is happy now: saw her and her daughter a little while ago), broke up from her abusive boyfriend. i changed it rapidly, with all the love my dad and i put into it when renovating, with all the colour i put in. it's my place now, completely mine. the fact someone else was unhappy here doesn't mean i have to be unhappy, too.  quite sad that evan's house will now never be a love-filled space, with susie hating it for no other reason but it being the place of kitsy's death.

      i'm back in the world of tricyclic antidepressants. i always vowed i'd never return, but here i am, willing to give them a try, once more.  i went to a new doc today, the one zuza recommended, and after a short but good consultation, left with a presciption for 25mg  urlLink elavil  and some peppermint oil for my  urlLink http://my.webmd.com/content/healthwise/56/13872">tension-type headaches . so i was spot on in my self-diagnosis and expected treatment.  the dosage is low: i am supposed to take 25mg, at night. - that is a third of the lowest dose given for the treatment of depression.  outside a clinical setting, the lowest dosage is 75mg, the highest recommended dosage is 300mg, so i really am taking very very little here. i am supposed to rub the oil into my temples when the headache kicks in, and that felt surprisingly good today already. i am not allowed to use any otc pain medication, no more aspirin. i need to call in and ask whether some naproxen will be fine though - i'll get my period next week, and usually need some then (usually one dosage a day); but who knows, maybe using my spanking new divacup will change that.  i wonder whether it'll work, this tricyclic approach.  urlLink it *is* up-to-date treatment for headaches , one of the latest trends, and i am actually quite happy i got this prescription, not some silly recommendation of  "relaxing more"  or something. the doc seemed knowledgable, the entire practice is specialised in both pain treatment, migraines, and depression. apparently, i am supposed to notice a change within 4 or 5 days . - the doc told me to schedule another appointment by mid-week if i don't notice an improvement till then, and to keep a headache diary. i wonder whether i'll get side effects, too. last time, 3 years ago on doxepin, they were terrible. i need to watch my food intake and exercise even more to make sure i keep them at bay. hopefully this little bit of meds will only have little side effects, too. i hated the dizziness, and the weight gain and the blood pressure troubles.  the more i think about it, the more i realise i actually wouldn't mind a full blown antidepressant prescription right now that much, even though i'd be weary to use tricyclics on normal dosage again. i just worry so much about sliding back, with all this change and all the decisions i'll have to make these coming months. i know so much of my behaviour is still not normal, still not healthy, and my anxiety needs to be dealt with. i have not been too good at getting the most out of my therapy anyway. i know that if i really wanted a prescription, i could get it from the doc i saw today, but dr.k. would never approve. and do i really want it? wouldn't it be terrible to use medication as a safety net?  i really am not that sure.

        "it's kind of hard to rush to your defence when i agree wholeheartedly with all that has been said you're cold, too self-assured by half controlled, like pouring water from a tap into a glass  i'm not about to give you what you want 'cos i think you've had your own way now for far too fucking long it's gone sour, tastes bitter on my tongue spent hours wasting, wait for something good to come along  if i knew then what i know now i guess i would have still have loved you (did you love me, did you know how?) it's funny but i love you now just like i loved you then, i can't pretend but that was how it started, this is how it ends  and i've been on a steady downward slide but now i'm sick and tired of sick and tired it's time to make things right it's fine, i'm thinking of myself and mine and me, not you or them or anybody else"   "that was how it started, this is how it ends"  ~cinematic~

      i threw the roses and the bouquet away. well, i didn't exactly "throw" them, no tearing them apart, no burning, no anger involved.  i put them into the dust bin downstairs, gently, the bouquet with the pin saying "nur die liebe zählt" facing up. i closed and locked the bin. i wonder what the neighbour who will put something in there next will think.  it felt and feels right, putting them away straight away, even though the empty spots at my bookshelf are painfully obvious.

      i am putting the last remaining symbols of our relationship away.   "we're all over. and i'm all over town. we've got work here. tearing it down."   it isn't that much: when i first started cleaning out and toning down to free my mind at the beginning of the month, a whole lot was put away already.  today, the last photos went into a box. every image of melbourne that was on display in my flat went with them. my water heater and the magnetic whiteboard, which i use to stick pictures on, are almost unadorned now. the large framed aerial shot of melbourne is hidden in a plastic bag and waiting to be brought into the cellar, once it has been wrapped in some cushioning newspapers.  i put away the compass he brought from thailand.   "for i have a compass i watch the sundial and i defy gravity just to get myself back to you" .  i need to find a new name for the blog.  i changed all my passwords.   the flowers will have to go tomorrow. there is a dozen dried roses i got from him before he left in early 2002. throwing them into a bin will be quite easy. the bouquet from  urlLink nur die liebe zählt , however, is not as easily dealt with. should that go into the cellar until i feel like getting rid of it for real or should i burn it straight away? i took it from the spot on the bookshelf where it has been hanging since we went on the show in january 2001. looking at my computer screen, i notice they are missing from my field of vision, these roses. they are dusty and smell a bit like honey. i put them back into their spot for now. - i will carry them downstairs tomorrow. for tonight, they can remain up there, where i don't notice them as much as if they are lying around, waiting to be brought out of this flat. - i know that i don't need them, i have the memories of that day, and images, yet i still cling to those roses. probably just because they are real, something i can touch, and smell, and hold on to. silly me.  i can't and won't put the cds away. i will just have to watch what i listen to. coldplay's "warning sign" was background music in today's buffy episode. it made me cry.  the two shirts, the grey suburban one i kept borrowing until he gave it to me, and the cookie monster one, will move into a corner of the wardrobe.  i will keep the silk shawl from thailand around though.  the jewellery will stay where it is, in the bathroom. i will not wear it. i haven't worn it in ages anyway. it was never really my style.  i packed away the brochures and leaflets from various melbourne universities and from the department of immigration, too. that was the hardest thing to do.  but i'll be fine. even though it hurts, this packing, even though i've been crying so hard my eyes are swollen beyond recognition, even though i've been scrunching up my face so terribly that my jaws hurt, even hough my head feels like it will explode, this is liberating.  something is ending, something new beginning.  i need to grieve right now. till now, i went along with the change without pausing for much thinking and for the sadness. even though it was over before today, it hadn't stopped for real, i hadn't stopped to recognize it was over.  today, i stop, finally. i put life on hold to get this done and over with.

      an upside to things being over now is that i can finally stop glossing over the bad stuff, and be honest, for real. to myself, here in this blog, to my family, those around me.  i re-read tonight what i wrote after returning in january, and can't believe how little i wrote, how i lied by leaving things out.  why did i leave out the never-ending trouble with his family? why did i not write about how they announced we should not be speaking german in the house? why did i not write about how sad christmas was and how misplaced i felt? why did i never tell someone how much it hurt that we couldn't sleep in the same room when at his parents place? why did i leave out the dissappointment about evan taking jim along to the sapphire coast? why did i not write about being so exhausted by his criticism, how i could never be good enough, no matter how hard i tried to comply with his wishes? why did i not write about my insecurities and worries, about feeling misplaced and unable to keep up? why did i not write about how he told me not to come along to an event with his colleagues, because a girl would be there who looked like me, and "i'd hate her"?  i wanted this relationship to be perfect, to look perfect. to myself, and others.   (writing this, i think about him being with someone else, and while i wish that he will find someone who can make him happy, better than i could, it still hurts. he and i, we had something, and we don't anymore, i should let go. but why does it hurt so much?)   with an ldr as extreme as this one, once people know you're in it, they somehow feel allowed to ask terribly personal questions, all the time.   how is it going with your partner? isn't that hard, that distance? how to you manage, you know, sexually? are you seeing anyone else? when is he coming over? ain't that a terribly long time?   these questions are there all the time. customers at the shop. former classmates. people from the exchange (who actually think we are married). people at gym. if people remember little about you, they do remember the 16.400km ldr and that you went on tv with it. i shared it openly in the good days, after all. when asking these questions, they never want to hear the truth; they want the glossed over version, the happy news, that you're the ones who manage. i always gave everyone the good news and the good news only, even to those who could have dealt with the truth, like my friends, or my family. i always smiled, and said thatall was well.  i never told them how lonely my emigration plans were. that evan never even read the leaflets from the department of immigration. that he and his family recommended ways of me getting money to finance uni that were rude and insulting. i never mentioned to anyone how terrible things were when jen was still around. i never told anyone i didn't get to meet any of his friends the first time i was in melbourne. i never mentioned how little evan communicated. how i felt that if i just loved him enough, strongly enough, he would love me, too.  but i can stop now. i can tell them it's over, and stop the lying through omission. i can stop it here at the blog, where i tried to convince myself all was well, and constructed an alternate reality, always expecting him to maybe start reading, one of these days. but he never did.  no more glossing over. just the barenaked truth. how liberating.

      the only reason i still somehow wanted evan to come over in july, even though it was already over in so many ways, was so we would get to say goodbye properly.  now the last time we were together will always be the goodbye in front of geelong hospital, the sunday i left in january. he had to work that day. i remember walking through the empty house afterwards, trying to leave an imprint, straightening things, putting up a photo of me on his nightstand.  it felt like the final goodbye, flying out that day. it was over then, somehow, and i can't really say why or put my finger on why it felt that way. it just did, and i tried ignoring it.  how strange. maybe that feeling, and the  "is that all?"  thoughts which came creeping up all the time i was there, were the reason why i became so clingy after returning, why i tried so hard to not loose track.  fact is, things were over before today. they were over before i kissed someone other than him, and when that didn't feel like the end of an era, or the breaking of a spell, as i thought it would. they were over before i slept with someone else, even though sadness settled in after that happened, because i realised it was over, and had been over for a while, and because it felt like a new thing was starting.  today was just the final blow, really, and i just wonder why he didn't falter at all. - very much not typical for him, to have an opinion, and a firm one at that.  how strange.

        "ich hab grad´ zärtlich an dich gedacht wie du behutsam und ganz sacht mich total verrückt gemacht du kamst wann du wolltest gingst morgens um acht tausendundeine nacht  ich hab dich lieb so lieb lieber als du denkst ich hab dich lieb solieb auch wenn du nicht an mir hängst  du wolltest dich nicht an mich binden mich so lange wahren eine familie mit dir das war mein traum doch dir war's viel zu früh es gibt bestimmt doch auch bessere andere als mich du willst dich erst umsehen man weiss ja nie  ich hab dich lieb so lieb lieber als je zuvor ich hab dich lieb so lieb ich nehm's halt mit humor  ruf doch mal wieder an und erzähl mir, was du träumst ist ganz egal wann, überrasch mich komm her und sag dass du bleibst  für immer jetzt für ewig oder mehr  doch halt - ich muss wohl schon träumen jeder hat so seinen tick für deine suche wünsch ich dir viel glück  ich hab dich lieb so lieb ich hoffe du verzeihst ich hab dich lieb so lieb ich will nur noch dass du es weisst ich hab dich lieb so lieb lieber als je zuvor ich hab dich lieb so lieb ich nehm's halt mit humor"   "ich hab dich lieb"  ~herbert groenemeyer~    just in case you don't speak german:  it's over with evan, for real. so i am single again, for real. and am not breaking any arrangements with anyone anymore. that's a good thing.  while this end has been a long time coming, and should be (and soon will be) a relief, right now, i am very sad.  saying goodbye to evan is saying goodbye to so many things, so many wishes and dreams and hopes and plans. i made so many mistakes i never want to make again. i will never let something like this happen to me ever again.  now i truly have no definite plans for my life left anymore and can give my life a much needed new direction.  it's sad, and grande, and scary, too.

      i was in a strange headspace last night.  it's been a strange few days here, and i have constant headaches, way too many things i should be doing but which i don't get done, because time rushes by too quickly, and there are other things that annoy me to no end. - it's the usual: uni, the parents, evan. i feel like i will never get this degree, because i am such a failure. my mother treats me like i am 5 years old, and i let her do that. evan left some cryptic message, and i am not sure whether to react. i think i  know  these headaches are just tension headaches, caused by stress and worries (which i have, doubtlessly), and the fear that this might be my next bout of depression sneaked in. last time, headaches were the physical manifestation of my budding depression.  last night, it all somehow culminated when i came home from watching matrix reloaded (which i -just for the record- still haven't formed a definite opinion on). i went with tina, who -i've realised again (how could i forget, really?)- apparently lives on a planet different than mine, so life felt lonely late last night, and i couldn't really reach out to the person i really longed to talk to, because there is no phone near him.  no good.  i am so bad at reaching out when i need someone, anyway. - i always make my needs smaller than they are. i did manage an email though, and was woken up, 30 minutes after going to bed, by a phone call, which made me smile, and life better.  so life is a bit better today already. i talked to my mother this morning, and told her how difficult it was to tell her things, if doing so turned her into big brother. i arranged for a docs appointment for friday to get the headaches checked out. i worked out. i need to do stuff for myself, and not let others rule my life. so difficult though, when there's so much to do and deal with right now.  so far, this week feels like a test whether i am indeed better, or whether the last weeks were mania after all.

      i'll have to write a thank you note to harilal, the yogacharya who taught the yoga-workshop that filled this weekend. apart from excellent asana practise, more than 3 hours on both days, he gave us several lectures on yoga and yoga-therapy.  this afternoon, as we all sat around him, listening, me kneeling with a meditation pillow, silke leaning on me so that i could stroke her head (in my experience yoga and these kinds of weekends always make everyone touchy-feely in a very good way), harilal said something that was like he switched on a lightbulb inside my head.  it wasn't a thought that is completely new to me, in fact, i had thought along similar lines before, but the way he phrased it was a revelation.  we were talking about spirituality. the essence of what he said is this.    "we don't need churches, mosques or temples. we should be spiritual everywhere we go, in everything we do. we should look after ourselves, our bodies, our minds at all times. our lives should be temples. our bodies should be temples. our homes and our families should be temples.  if we do that, if we rest in our lives, our bodies, our families and our homes, we won't need anything else, we won't be rushing around looking for happiness and contentment anywhere else, with far-flung travels to other countries, with ever-changing things."    bang.  now here we have the reasons why i was so dead-set on emigrating to australia, why i held on to the relationship to evan with such fervor, even though i felt so lonely, and got so hurt, and doubted so much.  three years ago my life wasn't a temple. it wasn't spiritual. i wasn't at home in my life, my body, in this city, with the people that surrounded me. - going away, searching for "salvation" and happiness in melbourne seemed better than what i had. until i met evan, i was never one to rely on a man, but with him, i did, and did so completely. - i clung to him, and a relationship that was faulty from the start, because it seemed like all would be lost if he was lost. falling in love with evan and making these extremely lonely emigration plans for these three years was not exactly conscious escapism, but being unable to see myself go on the way i lived back then definitely played a major role. when evan appeared on the scene, i suddenly had something to occupy myself with, an excuse for withdrawing myself from people, an excuse for not searching out better, healthier friends and making a career change. everything was suddenly solved - i'd "simply" go away.  truth is, nothing was solved. - the problems just kept piling up, because i was so lonely, and so unhappy in so many ways.  these days, my life is a lot better than it was for most of the past 3 1/2 years. - it surely feels like i am on the right track to being at home in my skin and my life again, to making both a temple. right now, the desire to live somewhere else, outside this country, this continent, is still there, but it has little to do with escapism and more with knowing i can be happy in many places, with many people, doing things i might not even think about yet. i does not have to be melbourne, with evan, no house in carlton or hawthorn, no ip law firm job.  i've finally realised that the only way that going away and a relationship can ever work is when i am already happy with where i am and who i am. for emigration to be a good, healthy thing to do, it can not be about fleeing from a situation that is unbearable. for a relationship to work, it can not be clinging to someone for fear of not having anything left if i let go.  thank you for making me realise that, harilal. namaste.

      i just came home from the seminar, and it rocked, and i'll have another day like today tomorrow. my phone will ring in a few minutes, and someone with a great voice will be on the other end of the line. i'll make myself some super tasty warm mozzarella sammies later.  the only thing that could make my life even better right now, now would be a  urlLink pimm's cup  (with half ginger ale, half lemonade), the main ingredient for which is not available here. thankfully, my dear brother is smuggling some  urlLink # 1  into the country for my birthday.  oh, i'm such a happy girl.

      i realised late last night, how much i value openess, honesty and capital r's.  earlier last night, i realised how good it is to spend an evening in entertaining company. food and wine were good, discussions interesting. a good time was had by all.  i'm happy. and now off to 6 hours of pranayama, asanas, meditation and mantras in the company of good friends. life is very good this side of the globe.

      tina and i will be entertaining guests tomorrow night: we have invited timo and paul for dinner.  i used to regard both of them as mates, a few years ago. when i started uni, i did what the majority of young female law students did: i partied, and  partied hard, at the local fraternities.  tina and i, we weren't just casual party-goers, we were die hard regulars at one particular frat house, spending almost all of our weekends there, being involved in traditional rituals, going to lunches as well as their balls, serving as dance partners during ballroom classes, the whole deal. - all that, even though at the parties, we often felt like nothing but decorations, like part of the inventory. looking back on it, it's hard to ignore my stupidity and blindness back then, playing high society with these insecure, stupid boys who were thinking they were the future leaders of this country. strangely enough, despite all the superficiality, tina and i had fun, at least for a while. lots of fun, actually. we both met tons of people there, not all of them jerks, and did good stuff, experienced cool events, making casual friends in the process. timo and paul were always good blokes, both doing theology, timo with the goal of becoming a priest (ever since tina rejected him, actually, hello thornbirds!), paul with the goal of becoming a teacher. they were blokes i liked and knew, that i spend time with, renting movies, hanging out outside the frat house.  with paul, things were maybe a bit more close than with timo. paul used to tell me about the gals he had crushes on, he used to sit on my balcony ogling the next door balcony, because one of his crushes lived there. no matter what, we were never really close, super-tight friends, always mates.  three years ago, when i first got depressed for real, i drastically cut ties to many people and things. within a very short period of time, i stopped seeing tina, stopped going to frat houses, stopped going to uni for a while and got rid of all casual and superficial friendships. - almost all friendships i entertained back then belonged to that category. that included both timo and paul. i made myself very very lonely.  it wasn't that anything was inherently wrong about timo and paul, or about our casual friendship, there was nothing that they had done wrong. somehow, i just couldn't deal anymore, with so many things that summer. couldn't deal with anyone, or anything, couldn't  pretend anymore to be someone i wasn't. i was never the happy go lucky frat house girl.  timo, paul and i, we were never so close that i could have come right out and told either of them what was wrong with me. neither of them belonged to the group of people who called me for months and who kept leaving messages, even though i never returned any calls. when i dropped out of the frat circle, out of the friendship with tina, and out of their lives, too, i never got the impression they cared that much. - i always thought that anyone wanting to be in touch with me knew where i lived, could easily find out my phone number, and would get in touch (even if my depressed self didn't react to any attempts), but they never did. apparently, they still cared on some strange level nonetheless. - not enough to make an effort, but enough to keep asking tina whether she knew how i was, even when she too, dropped out of the frat circle 2 years after me, when she split with the frat boyfriend i never really liked.   shortly after tina and i had reconciled earlier this year, tina ran into paul and told him about seeing me again. since then, he and timo have been keen to meet both tina and me. paul and timo are flatmates, they share one of the ugliest, dirtiest kitchen in town and are both hungry at all times, so tina and i thought cooking for them would be a good thing.  so we're doing that tomorrow night.  i'm curious about it, and nervous, too. not because of cooking dinner, i'm making stroganoff, and that's easy and quick and will work out fine - it's nothing to loose sleep over.  i wonder about this: tina and i, we picked our friendship up almost where we left it. - now what will it be like with those two? will we have stuff to talk about? will there be weirdness? how will it work out? i wonder and worry, just a little.  this time tomorrow night, i will know.

      how many times have i vowed to stop googling your name? how come i always have such terrible timing when i give in to the urge to see whether it turns up something new on what you do? how many times have i managed to find out about your latest readings just days after they happened?  this time, i'm 10 days late for one of your literary gigs in northtown. - you were reading as one of three special guests of northtown's latest avantgarde literature club. the recognised one, the one that country-wide feuilletons talk about.  i shouldn't kid myself. i wouldn't have gone up north anyway, even if i had known about your little gig beforehand: i was in montreal. even if i hadn't been, i wouldn't have tripped up north to see you read. - it would have been too absurd to travel several hundred kilometres to silently sit in the audience hearing and seeing you read, applauding you. i would have tried to look casual, when it would have been anything but.  but still. fact is: i wonder how you are.  in the picture they put up on their website, next to your little biography, you look severe, a little tragic, like the upcoming but currently starving and suffering multi-talented artist that you are. in your eyes i can see some of the disconnection i expect you to feel to it all. i imagine your face moving into a grin, soon after that picture was taken, but maybe that is just me imagining things. you look like yourself, despite that beard. looking at your image, it doesn't take much work to imagine what this new face of yours would look like when talking to me. i can actually hear your voice and know how you'd laugh at me, if you knew i was writing this.   the little bio calls you an  "all-rounder" , an  "exceptional artist with childish sujets and aggressive realism" . it talks about your animations, about your  "wonderful songs" , which  "are somewhere between brutal singer-songwriting and gentle, playful minimal electronica"  and about some of your stories, like the one about paul and marinade, who rub wollen dolls so that they don't have to have sex with each other.  i soak up the little info on the website and your image, just like i've soaked up all the little info on you i've stumbled across,  urlLink sometimes even when i wasn't looking for you , in the three years since we last met.  in some weird way, i still miss you in my life. in some weird way, i want you to know that i care about how you are and what you do and that i am happy for you because of your work and success. - even though i still suspect you would shrug that off, because it would just show that we never were, and will never be, equals. in some weird way, somehow, after all these years, despite it all, i still love you.  which no one really understands.

      there's an email in my inbox from jim, one of evan's close friends. you know, the one he took along to our supposedly "romantic" days alone at the sapphire coast, before his family joined us for the holidays.  jim writes:   how is everything with you? i understand from evan that all is going along pretty well but would be great to hear from you anyway.   i doubt this is a ploy to make me confess stuff to jim or get an inside view - if evan wanted that, he could simply  ask  me, or, if he wanted to be secretive, search for the blog, which he hasn't done. he never looked at it in the 2 years since i've had it. why would he now?  this little sentence actually makes me believe evan has not told jim anything about our recent troubles.  he's always been closed up to the people he calls his "friends", to his family, to everyone. always out to preserve the image of the perfect being he thinks they want him to be.  it's quite sad: jim's a good one, a reliable friend, he could give good advice and set stuff into perspective. - far better than anyone of his new friends could (not that i think evan has been discussing stuff with them), not just because he knows me, and knows me quite well. i'm sad for evan, that he's so lonely, and makes himself so lonely, and does not go out to get support from people who would care. while i can relate to his keeping things to himself (i'm not the most open person ever either, and i, too, keep stuff to myself sometimes, or from certain friends) i've realised in recent years that it's patently unhealthy for me to do so.  friendships work this way. they work through actual interaction, through opening yourself up, through making yourself vulnerable and being accepted nonetheless, - not just through watching the footie together and going to the same hospital for 5 years in a row.  so what shall i reply to jim?  i feel quite like telling like it is (with some exceptions, obviously), because he's a friend of mine as well. why would i want to keep up evan's silly pretense for him?

      it's been a rainy kind of day.  it rained in the early afternoon, when i finally got the much needed nap i had planned on having since the weekend, the rain bringing up pictures in my sleepy head of a morning in montreal.  it rained at the end of today's excellent yoga class, when we were lying with our legs up against the walls, the rain hitting the roof of the house gently, deepening the feeling of comfort and protection inside. on the way home from class, the sky was washed clear and blue, the world bright and shiny, and the air fresh. few things beat summer rain.  it also rained when tina and i stood on my balcony tonight, marvelling at the complete triple rainbow that span across the sky over the city, between st.martin's gate and the cathedral. i think i've seen a complete rainbow only once before: at tongariro national park in new zealand, in 1996. and today's rainbow was even more intense, and magical.  today was a day to stop and listen to the rain.  it's been a rainy kind of day, and i loved it.

      i don't get him. i don't get how he doesn't get it.  he called me this morning, waking me up, at quater to 9. we had talked on thursday, for 5 minutes, which were only about me having arrived safely on european soil. today's call was a  "let's pretend all is well"  maneuver, which i was too perplexed to end, because  when the phone wakes me up, i am always too startled and need a big chunck of time to wake up.  he told me he misses me, told me he missed me the week that i was away.  all i replied was that it had been a little strange because this had been the longest time we haven't been in touch since december 1999. i did not miss him though. it was more me missing a habit, a ritual.  bizarrely enough, he has not asked a single thing about my week away.  not who i stayed with, who i met, what i did. nothing. not after i've been throwing in names.  i listened, asked polite questions. the only thing i truly submitted was about me running low on energy because of recent sleep deprivation and not having spent an evening alone in 3 weeks. he didn't ask what i had been up to these three weeks. he's so out of the loop, and not out to change it. this morning, all i could do was observe, and note it, i didn't feel like changing it.  there are so many things i could say if i wanted to truly, awfully hurt him, about what i have been up to, about what is so not happening between us anymore, but i don't. i still like him, still love him, on some level, yet i am truly and utterly amazed and just don't get how he can say he loves me not knowing me, not caring about what's up, not realising this is the end, my lonely friend, the end.  imagine the scenario: your partner tells you (s)he needs a relationship break, does not know where it will go, tells you (s)he is not planning anything anymore in regards to your relationship, then spontaenously goes off to another city in another country (which (s)he never mentioned before). would you not  react  in any way?  i would. i would be alarmed. but he isn't.  don't get me wrong, the purpose of flying out to montreal was not to stir him up, to get him to react - it was not revenge. but i am certainly wondering why he is still not reacting.  but then, maybe that isn't that bad, after all. him fighting for real now, trying to win my love back, would quite possibly be even more alienating that this silence already is.

      i am tired tonight, and thoughtful, too.  i should think through lots, find words for things and situations, say things, but right now, i can't, really. i realised it's been almost three weeks since the last time i spend a whole evening by myself, and almost 2 months since i wasn't totally sleep deprived at all times. tina was here tonight, and i was so exhausted i fell asleep during the chick flick we watched. i like it, all this interaction i've had lately, all these new people, all this talking and doing things, but i need some time to settle, to process - time with myself. or, alternatively, time with someone who does not expect entertainment and sparkliness from me, as the two local blokes (who have, on two consecutive days, been proclaiming how smitten they are with me in almost the exact same words) do. - i want more of what i had last week, and i also want my austrian tina back.  i urgently need a whole day by myself, a day that i can spend with splurging things into notepad to post or not post here, time for long due emails that need time to be replied to, no appointments, no work out, nothing, just me.  instead of whining about it, i should just make time for it, shouldn't i? however, i worry about all these new people, fear that they will be gone when i am not available when they ask or send sms, when i say no to coffees at uni cafe or hanging out or ice creams. - so yeah, i have trouble with my boundaries and my needs, now that i finally do have a social life to speak off again, now that i am finally alive again.  time to start finding a balance. but first: off to bed.

      i spend 30 on peace of mind today.  in the process, i called roughly 10 doc's offices, explained that no, my request made sense even though 30 hours had passed (screw uninformed medical staff), sat in waiting rooms for about 3 hours total and saw two docs, the latter of whom i will make my new local gyno. she just totally rocked.  not only did she have a bhagavad gita in her waiting room, but instead of simply writing out the perscription for plan b, which would most likely have involved throwing up and nausea and me worrying for a few more weeks, she did an ultrasound to check whether anything had been or was happening with my ovaries because of the missed pill that was to blame for this worry. - thankfully, it hadn't and wasn't anywhere near anything happening. it would have been strange anyway, because my body was never good at ovulation in the first place. blessed be diane-35 and my pcos-screwed-up body. sure, at 30 that ultrasound was more than twice what plain old ec would have been, but i must admit that it was worth every cent.  other screens will still have to happen, obviously, but those were good, peace of mind giving black and white ultrasound images today.   note to self :    keep in mind that life's little dramas always arrive with the worst possible timing.  there is something like too much of a good thing. yes, this applies to astroglide inside condoms.

      i'm still in between it all. not there anymore, not home yet, right now sitting at a 10p per minute computer terminal at london city airport, waiting for my flight to frankfurt.  it's only been a week since i took off for montreal, and it seems like so much longer, because so much happened. right now the entire trip feels quite surreal though, too - doubtlessly partly because i am sleepfucked and the lights are bright round here, but also because it was so extreme in a way. did it really happen? did i really fly over the atlantic, just because?  and what now? one thing is sure: beginning. no end.

      we went flying yesterday, the  urlLink airman  and i. and fly, he can.  it was my first time ever in a small airplane, and i had expected it to be scary, with nothing but that tiny little bit of metal between me, several thousand feet of air and the ground and all. alas, it wasn't - it was far less scary than flying in a 747 or any other bigger airplane for that matter. and not only was it totally not scary, it was actually downright sexy and enjoyable.  yesterday was a day of shitty weather here in montreal - rain and grey skies and lowish clouds and lots of unpleasantness. the weather reports were unfavourable - jack's flight school only releases planes when clouds are above 1500 ft, and all morning, they were at 1000 ft. we made our way out to his airfield nonetheless, he started flight planning (calculating the plane's weight and balance) and we waited for some more weather reports - they stayed terrible. it looked like all we would be able to do would be touch and go's - continually landing, taking off and circling around and doing it all over again, which i thought would be exciting enough anyway.  so we got the plane ready, i got my passenger instructions ( touch nothing, unless i tell you to! ), and my very own set of headphones, and jack started talking to the tower. which, i tell you, is a very good thing to listen to.   ground, good afternoon, this is  urlLink cessna 172  sierra oscar foxtrot at the flight school, with the ATIS, for touch and go's.   jack's all competent when sitting in a plane, talking into his mike - serious, knowing, friendly and in charge. and well, if you listen to his radio, he's got quite a distinctive voice there, the man.  do me the sierra oscar foxtrot, darl.  just after first contact with ground, waiting to be let on the runway for the touch and go stuff, the latest weather reports came in. the clouds which had been reported at 1000 ft the previous hour, were now reported at 1700 ft. - which meant that after asking ground to ask the flight school, we could do our planned city tour, circles over downtown montreal.  it was absolutely fucking awesome.  it's so great to be right next to the pilot, especially the pilot being jack, hearing all communication between him and tower, seeing him actually fly the plane, looking extremely content when doing so. i tell you, there are few moments when jack looks happier then when he's got those headphones on, and the yoke (the steering wheel of the plane) in his hand.  it's very direct, the little plane and very comfy, too. usually, flying seems so strange, so unusual, a bit against human nature to me. up there, in the cessna with jack, it was perfectly right and normal and comfortable and safe, and i wanted more than the three circles over the city that we could do before the weather got too terrible (clouds dropping to 800 ft).  it was so fabulous an experience that all i could do was smile and be happy and admire the city from above and the pilot right next to me. it needs to be repeated.  tonight though, in 4 hours, it will be a stupid big old 772 that i will fly with, to london, and without the airman on board. these were good days, these six days in may (6dm), and it will be strange to be back in my life on the other side of the atlantic, without flights and him and all the things he is and does.

        they met in a hurricane standing in the shelter out of the rain she tucked a note into his hand later on they took his car drove on down where the beaches are he wrote her name in the sand never even let go of her hand  somehow they stayed that way for those 5 days in may made all the stars around them shine funny how you can look in vain living on nerves and such sweet pain the loneliness that cuts so fine to find the face you've seen a thousand times  sometimes the world begins to set you up on your feet again it wipes the tears from your eyes how will you ever know the way that circumstances go always going to hit you by surprise i know my past you were there in everything I've done you are the one  looking back it's hard to tell why they stood while others fell spend your life working it out all I know is one cloudy day they both just ran away rain on the windshield heading South she loved the lines around his mouth  sometimes the world begins to set you up on your feet again it wipes the tears from your eyes how will you ever know the way that circumstances go always going to hit you by surprise i know my past you were there in everything I've done you are the one    ~blue rodeo~  "5 days in may"

       urlLink friday five    1. would you consider yourself an organized person? why or why not?  i am highly organised. bordering on ocd, one might say.   2. do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?  yes. an old fashioned black one page per day calender. i long for a palm pilot. hmmmm.   3. would you say that your desk is organized right now?  yes, it is, and not just because i am an ocean away from my desk at the moment. -  it always is.   4. do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?  it matters. a lot. cd's are organised by genre, band and date of publication. books are sorted by genre, language, publishing house, authour and date of publication.   5. what's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?  immigration to australia. i found it absolutely overwhelming and scary. - it was probably my unconscious telling me it might not be the right thing to do in the first place. now that those plans are resting for the moment, i feel much better.

      i'm in montreal, and i like it. a lot.  montreal is a fabulous town. days are spend with carefully measured amounts of touristy stuff, generous amounts of strolling through town doing nothing in particular, tasting food i've never had before (how can i ever live without bagels again?), hanging out and meeting people i have known for years, yet never met before. - like my fellow  urlLink scarleteeners   urlLink rizzo ,  urlLink dzun  and bettie, who is a rocking kind of woman, has a cat i wanted to take home and a smart husband. above all though, i've been getting the  urlLink jack spratt  tour of montreal, getting to know the airman himself face to face.  i got the inside track now - i've seen rocky sit in front of his tv all day, have been to the regiment, where i met goodbar (who is quite a charming boy, when you first meet him). i listened to jack and goodbar sing songs in the mess. i now know which green leather chair he sits on when writing, i have had my fair share of bleues, had brekkie at cosmo's and can attest that he does wear army issued boots at all times. and his bum is one of the reasons people call him j-lo. furthermore, there will be  urlLink chicken broccoli linguine  tonight, and flying tomorrow, should these thunderstorms stop.  strangely enough, it didn't faze me at all to fly over the atlantic and meet someone for the first time face to face. - it feels like we have known each other for years, which we have, after all, since the old opendiary days. i also realised yet again, that computers and blogs and message boards and icq and emails do not distort someone's true personality by default - which is reassuring, i guess.  it's good for me, this little break. it's all good. and everybody's happy.

      am in frankfurt, all checked in, and ready to board, soon. strange, being at this airport with a destination that is not the usual one. just changed money, and it's the first time i ever had canadian dollars, i think. there will be plenty of first times during this trip, i guess.  dirk saw me off at the train station this morning after dropping by for a spontaenous brekkie, which was lovely. - in the past, leaving the city for frankfurt airport often felt like fleeing it, and today it didn't, even though one might argue that this trip has the air of running away from stuff about it.  it's strange, and good, everything that has happened these past weeks, and i want more of it. more happiness. more people around. more sparkling conversations. more life. i think i'm on the right track.

      2 1/2 more days. 2 more sleeps.  both days will be featuring 30°C, and sunshine, and doubtlessly pass by quickly: there are train tickets that need to be bought, some uni stuff that needs being done, laundry, too, there is underwear waiting to be bought (yes, that is how bad it is), more exercise to rid myself of nervous energy and make me worry less about my butt, ordering some currency (or maybe they have this one at all times anyway?) and finally packing, too. the usual drill before one hops on a plane. this being so spontaenous, the obsessive-compulsive in me is worried about overlooking lots.  but it will be fine. i have no doubt that everything will be fine, in fact. i thought i'd be more nervous this close to wednesday, but right now i am just excited, in a calm, happy way. the worst case scenario is that we have all this stuff to talk about, just without chemistry, which i not only don't expect, but which would still mean we'd make exceptionally good, close friends.  it's a no-lose situation, so to speak. lucky me. lucky us.

      these two hours on the phone were no fun.  i found myself firing off bitter sounding observations, to no fighting back, to silence.  i was hurt and angry and sad, simultaneously throughout, and while some things are out in the open now, they are far from clean and sorted, obviously. 3 1/2 years do not end just like that, with one phone call, even if that's the culmination point to 10 weeks of underground argueing. there are still things between us, but crucial things have gone missing; there are disagreements on fundamental issues that do not seem to be reconcilable.  right now, i feel better, and worse, at the same time. as needed as change is, actually setting it off does hurt. it's the mind clinging to permanence, i guess. no matter how shitty that permanence is.  i think these are growing pains.

      life is good. no, let me correct myself: life is fucking brilliant.  i had the most delightful night out last night, with claudia from yoga, and two of her friends. - it was the first time we ever hung out outside yoga class, and i am sure it wasn't the last time.  kicked off the evening with cocktails at jackson pollock bar, ogling blokes and discussing life, and then moved on to  urlLink jazzhaus . hadn't been there in ages, and had forgotten what a decent, attitude-free place full of diverse people, and free of chart music it is. it was "funky dance night - djs meet live musicians", and the musicians were  urlLink rachel morrison & meeker , who had played a concert there earlier that night. they were extremely energetic, you could feel how much they enjoyed playing, tom morrison, the guitarist, was extremely attractive, and the music was funky, melodic and highly danceable. - just what i needed, really: we danced for two hours straight.  so still no full night of sleep for me - was up and running by 8am, after maybe 5 hours of sleep, because the sun was shining into my room, and so i went to the gym for an upper body work out and a nicely taxing hour of spinning. i think i will now spend a good part of the afternoon napping. - so unusual that i have been living on so very little sleep lately. really have to be careful not be totally out of energy by mid-week.  it's a lovely day today - warm and sunny, the air is clean and the sky blue, i'm wearing a denim skirt that's falling off my hips and a bonds singlet, and it feels very promising, this summer. i can't remember feeling this alive, this well, this energised in years.  but i am not complaining, at all.

      you can stop calling me mrs.robinson:  urlLink dirk  is not a teenager, after all, but 25, and hence a mature-aged student doing his abi after an apprenticeship, three years of work, and some round-the-world-travelling. what a relief to know that my age sensors aren't totally off.  and he's nice and entertaining, too!

      i am completely still and in complete turmoil at the same time. and i like it. a lot.  it's hard to put into words, - hence all those lyrics these past few days.  it feels like i am growing up in leaps and bounds right now by behaving in the most non-adult way imaginable. i am putting myself, and my wishes, before everything else, for the first time in years. i'm behaving totally out of "character" (whatever that is, anyway), yet doing just that feels perfect in so many ways.  the mantra is:  if not now, when?   i'll be 25 next month, and had symptoms of the dreaded quater life crisis for months: pointless worries about goals and relationships and things being different now than what i thought they'd be like 5 years ago. i'm still in europe. i am not married and not engaged and most likely will not be either to the person i thought i'd be both with. i still haven't finished my degree. i am not working the high paying job at a commercial law firm that wants my soul, nor do i want that anymore.  i realised this past week that i want to look back at being almost 25, and -hell, at my entire life- without pointless thoughts and useless wishes and longing dreams about things that might have been. - instead, i want to do the walking over the edge of the rappel tower, and act as if my life were a movie script and see what's up and know for sure.  it got kicked off tuesday morning, harmlessly enough, with a paragraph in the middle of an email making my head spin, for hours, during a busride, doing my upper body workout, during a step class, an ab class and when under the showers. what seemed insane at first thought soon seemed very needed and like the only sane, useful thing to do.   "i say fly to see me. really soon."   to which my head replied:  if not now, when?   now, 3 days later, after little dramas, it's a firm, definite plan. and i like it, a lot. as scary as some things about this still are, as unsorted they are, as against what i always said i wanted things to be like.  i was seriously worried this might be some kind of mania, actually. - dr.k. says it's not, and that it's just right for me, to do what i will be doing, and not a symptom of some kind of dysfunction. i believe him. strangely enough, everyone agrees with me, too, even the parents, who today rekindled my belief that they are actually human after all.  how strange. how wonderful.  it's still all in between. in midair. in flux. changing. exciting. it's leaving me breathless.  i can't say that i mind though.

       urlLink alles neu macht der mai , was the comment my mom made when i told her about the revamp of my place i am doing today and tomorrow and however long it will take this weekend.  right now, the flat is in a similar state as my head: a total mess.  for some strange reason, i can't seem to find my cleaning & tidying rhythm today. - i keep jumping from one corner to the other, one task to the next. very untypical.  i'm throwing some things away, putting others away for the moment (or maybe forever, too?), creating space to breathe in the process. it's direly needed, and an outside manifestation of what's been going on inside of me.  i'd really like to paint this place, tear out the carpet, make it all bare, but if i stop and think for a moment,  that would be overreacting and quite pointless, because no matter what happens, i won't be in this space for a very long time. - and i can't afford paint right now anyway.  i took all pictures and paintings and posters off the wall.  when i removed the robert delaunay poster, the paint crackled and came off where the  urlLink poster strips  had been. fuck. will have to cover those spots now - that much for poster strips not damaging the ground they are stuck upon. - i had planned on leaving that bit of wall bare.  am not sure whether i should put the framed aerial view of  downtown melbourne away. it's pretty. i got as a pressie from the law firm in september, it hangs in view of my desk, and i am not sure i want it in sight right now. or want it at all, for that matter. i guess i might take it off yet keep it up here in the flat, under the bed maybe, and see how i feel without it. delaunay is gone forever, as is the framed tate gallery poster. only have one replacement so far:  urlLink red on maroon, one of rothko's seagram murals . i reserved at a shop in town yesterday. i'll see what ikea has in store, too. - i'd like another rothko, but i can barely afford the one print (of pretty low quality anyway) i picked now. the framed nude by alfred, my arts teacher, will stay, as will the haring calender, as much as i hate it. i decided i won't care what month it is, and just have those images up that i like and that fit colour-wise. mybe the poster in the kitchen will go, too. i am not sure yet.  so. other things to go: the fake sunflower that used to be on the windowstill. apart from the stones from nz, actually all the knick knack that used to be on the windowstill is gone, as is all the stuff on my desk and around the computer. it will be nice once i have plants on the balcony, to have an unobstructed view of them outside.  it hurts a little, this putting away. who am i doing this for? for me? for someone else? why do i want it bare? fact is, i do. i want space. less stuff where dust can accumulate. fewer things to distract my mind.  i already feel that it's better for me, to be surrounded by less stuff. and this is still my place.  what a strange day today.

      it's been a hectic past few days, with the parents in town.  they arrived midday friday by train, just hours after i had said goodbye to  urlLink jack  at the train station. friday night, they were so tame and nice i was startled and wondered what was wrong with them. saturday morning, however, started with nasty comments by my dad about dirk (whom he  has not yet met, i might add), continued with my mother mistaking shopping with me for caring for me and culminated in me crying once i had got home and they had set off to spend the afternoon in france. it sucked muchly.  by the time dirk, kolja and friends (garb, doro, martin) and i were to set off for  urlLink zmf  to see  urlLink die fantastischen vier  perform unplugged (and after some booze and dope, i might add), all was well again though, and a grande night of jumping and screaming and singing along was had by all. the greatest moments of the night were doubtlessly thomas d. (man with the most beautiful  urlLink tats  in hip hop) singing  urlLink liebesbrief  and the final performance of all time fave  urlLink tag am meer . fucking awesome, that night.  sunday was filled with a touristy 5 hour drive through the blackforest (including ending up in the middle of church celebrations in a small black forest village, where everyone wore tracht, i'll have to write about), which was scenic, but mightily stressful, too. i can't really explain what was wrong, but afterwards i was tired and drained and couldn't really say what was wrong, but all was wrong, and yeah, i cried again. which -for the record- i hadn't in weeks, really. not since the end with evan at least. i think dirk was lost, with me being so out of it, for the first time since we're together. it's the effect the parents have, i think, which so nicely collided with me having my period and being stressed out anyway. duh. i would have wanted them to be there because of me, to just hang out and talk and relax, but instead it was hectic and stressful and touristy, and money was an issue at all times, and i hated it. and my mother made some of the most ridiculous comments i have ever heard.  i need some time to get back on track, i think, to reconfigure and get back to normal, and some cuddlies to ease my mind. so much change in such short time, guests, so much stuff packed into just a few days. - no wonder i am drained.  it will be well, i know it. but right now, i'm awfully sorry for how strange i have been, and how weird things felt last night and this morning with dirk, just because i was weirded out by them being here, and trying to make my point nonetheless that i was in charge of my life (e.g. telling them i didn't want them to meet, because they had an opinion already anyway, and because i neither wanted nor needed their approval). we picked up our results at the health department today (which should be written about seperately as well, i guess), but haven't had time for celebrations so far, which feels wrong, as well. negative hiv tests call for champagne, i think.  but it will be well. because it's summer, and we are in love, and life is fucking brilliant, underneath it all.

      monday, on the way home from the supermarket, carrying a four pack of rigos under one arm, dirk and i passed by two obviously homeless punks sitting at a bächle near my place, begging. the two were in good spirits, jokingly shouting at us  "hey folks, how are you? can we have one of your rigos?"    "well, blokes, usually, sure thing, but it's my birthday today, and we're doing some partying so we need all four of them. but next time, i'll give you one, alright?"  i replied.   "oh, it's your birthday? cool! congratulations!"   the two of them offered me handshakes and well wishes, and i graciously accepted them. after a short little chat, dirk and i got going again, and they shouted after us wishing us a great day and telling us that they'd smoke some dope in my honour that night, which i laughed about and thanked them for.  yesterday afternoon, the two of them were sitting at the exact same spot again, and i walked past them on the way back from the supermarket.   "hey blokes, how are you today?" .  both were in great spirits, recognising me, asking how my birthday went.  "you gonna be here for another few minutes?" , i asked,  "if you'll be here for another half an hour, i'll go home and get you the leftover rigo i still have from monday, what do you reckon?" .  an offer that wasn't refused.  thirty minutes later, i get back to them, giving them that last rigo, icecold from my fridge. they seem amazed i kept my word, and laugh, and so do i. we chat some more, i ask how they are, how long they'll stay in town, and whether there is anything else i can do. i tell them that i'd prefer giving them something a bit better than booze, like something to eat, if they wanted. they tell me that yeah, they hadn't had anything proper to eat all day and that they'll stay in town till the weekend, before moving down to zürich. i  tell them that next time i see them this week, i'll get them something proper, if they want, which the two tell me would be cool. i got to go and tell them  "look after yourself, you two cuties  (which they are, really)  i'll see you around later this week."   before i rush off though, the one sporting a mohawk tells me he still has a birthday pressie for me, and hands me a a scrap of paper, containing enough pot for one joint.  i smile as i walk away, and for much of the evening, when thinking about those two, and in what great mood they are, despite it all. they seemed happier than many.  i realsied that sharing stuff you enjoy yourself (no matter whether its just dope and booze), and friendliness and talking and connecting, no matter how brief the period of time is, no matter how different someone seems to be compared to yourself, are seriously good things, that light up your day.

      i have a severe case of birthday hangover. or something.  i am tired after all these birthday celebrations, tired because of the heat, annoyed because the parents will be here this weekend and my flat isn't clean enough to abide by my mothers standards, tired, too, because i haven't had a day for myself in ages. annoyed, too, because i am in pain from a bike crash that happened monday morning on the way to the hiv testing (that's what you get for wanting to hold hands while cycling. lesson learned.). i sure look like i've been beaten up, so bad is the bruising on my leg and the scraping on my knees. - it's so bad that walking, sitting, sleeping hurts. jack is coming to visit tonight, for the next day and a half, and while that's great, after everything that's happened, i am already sorry because he'll see such a grumpy, annoyed me.  it's all been well though, really, i am just severely low on energy now, and need rest and lone time, and a cool drink, too.  last night, i went to silke's little birthday bash, which was fabulous. she had it themed -  "arabian nights" - and everyone was dressed colourful and fun. it was a wonderful get together on her large balcony, with plenty of interesting people, and plenty of interesting talk. i found myself in deep talk about yoga with harilal, who is leaving for india next weekend, thanking him again for the workshop and what it did to me. i also ended up in deep talk about life and changes and my "favourite emotions" with amoth, a friend of ralph & silke's. excellent stuff, really. i also chatted to ann-kathrin, markus wife, who nearly died of hellp syndorme and an assortment of other severe complications (kidney fauilure, necrosis of the liver, severe infections later on) after giving birth to their first son three months ago. she's a wonderful, fantastic woman, and their child is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful and adorable. it was a really good, enjoyable evening. - i cycled home past one am, barefoot, happy and tired, enjoying the brief ride through the city.  my birthday on monday was fine, too: beautiful, sun, champagne, love and rigo filled day, followed by late night talking and a short night at dirk's. - it was the best in years, i'd say.  dirk came over late sunday night, and we sat outside and talked and when it was midnight i unpacked the remaining pressie from the rents (the harry i'd been reading already, and i got a hairdryer i had wished for). dirk gave me an highly personal present, that got me absolutely smitten. the little box is sitting on my desk now, right here next to my computer, and i keep opening it, looking at its contents, holding them, feeling them, admiring them. they might look like nothing to an outsider, the little things in there, but having heard their stories, they mean a lot. no money in the world can buy a present like this. wow.  monday morning, after the bike crash, we went to the health department, which was a funny experience, overall, even though i was quite surprised how little pre-test counselling they gave. it's a week till the results, and i am also surprised by how unworried i am this time around, at least about the hiv. my blood was very light on colour again, and so i am concerned about low hb again. guess i should head to the blood bank again, to donate and see what it's like, my hb. oy. after the blood testing, dirk took me out to brekkie, right downstairs at uc, which was a lovely little luxury. afterwards, we went to the laundromat, where dieter and marco openend a bottle of champagne on me, and fun was had by all. alcohol in above 30° weather, in the middle of the day, has funny effects.  after some exhausted napping and a funky phone call by  urlLink jens , dirk and i headed out on the bikes for a half an hour ride to a lake recommended by dieter in the afternoon. it was lovely: great water, great location, few people. we swam (pretty much) naked again (i am turning into a nudist one of these days, i swear - but it feels so much nicer to be in the water without a bikini...and i must admit that i've never seen anything prettier than naked dirk coming out of a lake. yum.), were lying around reading mags and harry potter and having rigos and watermelon. a very simple, very lovely kind of fun. in the evening, after a nap and a shower, we cooked dinner and ate on the balcony, i made the dough for jamie oliver choc chip cookies for silke, and we rode to dirk's place. i baked the cookies, he packed for his school trip (coming home tomorrow), and we talked late, about important stuff, outlooks on life. it pushed some of my buttons though, that talk, and made me feel low, unable to pin down the exact reason that caused my low-ness. it was still there when i woke up tuesday morning, still there when we said goodbye before he hurried off to the train station for his trip, and little bits of it are still here, as i type this. i talked to evan, too, yesterday, and that re-enforced some of that strange feeling as well. i told him that i am seeing someone, and he got very upset, telling me the break-up was all because of me, that he was replacable and obviously never meant much to me and giving me the usual mindfuck about me making all the rules and being pushy and yadayadayada.  it upsets me that i am *still* gloomy, because all should be fine and dandy and cool, because all is fine and dandy and cool. it is summer. i am in love.  what else do i want? what else do i need?  i hate it, how these old issues keep creeping up, once a week, just because, sparked by stuff i still can't really identify. i think i will take up amoth's offer and talk about them with him again.  one thing amazed me: i told dirk monday night, in our deep discussion, how things are rarely black or white for me, but many many shades of grey instead. evan, on the other hand, just 10 hours or so later, accused me of seeing everything as either black and white.  strange, really. i am realising i spend three years with someone neither knowing him, nor being known by him. how strange. how sad.

       scenes from the waiting room at the hiv testing & support services at the health department.   4 people are waiting, all in their twenties.  a good looking, dark haired straight bloke, reading the day's paper. a queer bloke, wearing flip flops, shifting in his seat, being impatient and bored. a couple, consisting of a tall, blonde nervous looking bloke who keeps fidgeting with vaccination leaflets, accompanied by a completely unfazed, blonde gal with bruised knees and elbows, who keeps looking at the info material around, snickering at inaccuracies and misses   "these idiots have missed out on hpv in this brochure!" .  nervous bloke, looking for something to take his mind off the needle ahead, grabs a leaflet from the table next to him. it's a little info book for men and boys, full of info on anatomy and related issues. he starts reading the introduction, and the first paragraph reads    "in this booklet you will find out, among other things, why it is in some regards better to have a small penis..."     "what?!"  nervous bloke shouts in shock,  "what is that about?" .  his blonde chica grabs a booklet, too, and starts reading as well, breaking out in laughter when she realises which sentence upset the male by her side. she gently pats his head:  "don't worry, they're just saying it to make those with low self-esteem feel better. you really don't have to worry about anything at all. it's all fine and dandy and working just right, so stop stressing."   nervous bloke stays slightly agitated though.  "but in the first sentence? hitting you over the head with something like that? telling me something is wrong about me?" .  the blonde chica by his side keeps laughing. the laughing and amusement on both their parts grabs the attention of the other two people in the waiting room.  flip flop bloke reaches over to the table next to nervous bloke, and grabs the same booklet he and chica have been so amused about. he starts reading the introduction. seconds later, doubtlessly straight after finishing the first sentence, he breaks out in loud, hearty laughter, grinning at nervous bloke and his chica, who breaks down laughing in return again.  as a result, straight bloke next to nervous bloke reaches for the same leaflet as well. blonde chica encourages him  "come on, read it, too, we can start a group discussion on the issue then!" , while nervous bloke exclaims  "oh, yeah, come on, read about my worries."   straight bloke starts reading, and breaks down laughing as well. the door to the examination room opens, a woman comes out and flip flop bloke can walk in, to pick up his result, breaking the little laughing circle the four had formed. doubtlessly, there has rarely been that much laughter in that waiting room before.  moral of the story? you never know where fun and laughter and snickering with people you've never met before can happen. the waiting room in front of the examination room where you'll get your hiv test or its results might be one. yet another reason to get tested, regularly.

       what a year it has been   it's my birthday tomorrow, and with that comes, as usual, a reflective frame of mind.  there hasn't been much headspace to think these past days: happiness, and sex, and booze, and dope, and the sun, do not spark great intellectual thoughts overall, i find.  dirk and i have been together much of the time, too, so there has neither been time nor desire to sit down at the computer to create a moment for thinking and writing. - been too busy lying at the dreisam, talking and reading, too busy sitting on the balcony, too busy being busy with each other. he's been away now and there is time to think and write for me, while he is grass boarding with michi, coming over again sometime later today to be here when my birthday starts. it's strange to realise 2003 is already halfway over, strange that it's my birthday, yet again, that i'm slowly heading from mid-twenties to late twenties, strange to realise that right now i am in a place completely different to the one i thought i would be in on my birthday one, two, three years ago. i always thought that by 25 i'd already be in australia, possibly married or about to get married to evan, long done with uni, working.  i am nowhere near any of that, and fucking hell, am i happy.  it surely has been an extraordinary year, this last one, and that's even more true for this first half of 2003, the last three months specifically. it's been choc full of change and thoughts and realisations, this 2003. as strange as it may sound, but with all the ass-kicking and hurt and fear and screaming and crying it has been treating me well, this year, waking me up, bringing me to life again, changing me, for the better.  no wonder i couldn't see myself where i am right now. - out of my mind happy. truly, madly, deeply in love with a man like dirk. pondering life, feeling like groundbreaking decisions are waiting just around the corner.  i don't blame myself: how could i have imagined any of this? it seemed set in stone (at least superficially, not deep down inside of myself) that life with evan in melbourne, marrying him, moving, having children, doing law for the rest of my life. anything but the plan with evan had turned into an non option, which, i guess, was the beginning of the end in a way for him and me anyway. no wonder i never even wondered whether there might be something better for me, something healthier, someone else, someone who truly wants me, someone i truly want, too. strangely enough all those silly, silly plans i had made, what i thought our wedding should be like, what have you, now seem insane, and like nothing i could, would do. ever.  i felt strongly for evan. i loved him. it's strange to realise that that has changed, completely, and that it had for months, which i just didn't want to realise when it happened, which was obvious in my wondering  "so this is it?"  while in was in australia this past winter. we talked sometime this past week, evan and i, and it is gone, whatever i felt for him in the boyfriend/girlfriend category. i love him, still, somehow, as a friend, if you will, and there is no residual anger, no pain, no hurt from the break-up left. i feel love for him because of the time we spend together, these years. i talked about it with dirk yesterday, wanting to say that i still love evan in some way because we know each other so well, but i realised that would have been a lie. sure, we knew lots about each other, but i can't help but wonder how much of it was real. back then, my thought was  i wish i could be who you wanted all the time , so i constructed a version of myself i thought he would love. sure, i know lots about him, little thing, big things, but considering how long it took him to be honest with me regarding his feeling about my move, i wonder how much i truly, deeply know about him. there are things i suspect right now, that i can't, won't post here, things i feel i know about him, that i wonder about, wonder whether they are accurate, and if they are, whether he knows them yet, will act about them, be honest to himself. it's a strange thing, knowing someone. talking to evan briefly on thursday, i was mainly happy to hear his voice, happy to laugh with him, but very strongly felt that he might become a lifelong friend, but could have never ever been my life partner. i told him so. i wonder whether it freaked him out.  what i feel for dirk now is just so very very  different  on so many levels, that i have trouble expressing it without sounding like a lunatic or on the rebound. - and i am neither.  i wish evan could see me now, not because i want to hurt him or want him to see what he is missing out on. i want him to see me, because i think he should see me, the real me, just once. i want him to see the changed outside, make-up less, dressed down, skinny, long haired, tanned caro, and my changed inner me, this much more unsure about life, undepressed, completely and utterly happy in her own skin caro. the one who sleeps outside waiting for shooting stars, who swims topless in a lake, who loves yoga and reads the bhagavad gita, who is finally enlarging her circle of friends again, who feels like she needs little in life for happiness. i doubt he would recognise me.  i read in my old diaries today, about what i did and where i was on my birthday the last few years since moving here, and it makes me realise how changed i am, too. the 1998 birthday had a drinking session on my balcony with the two tinas and some frat boys at my old flat. in 1999, i had a big ass party with moritz at the frat place, a party that got really expensive because so much beer was consumed, and where half the people didn't even know it was my birthday. i remember being sad because didi didn't even call, and ogled arndt, who's getting married one of these weekends. in 2000, i had a party here at my place, as pictures from then tell me. 2001 was spend with michel and tina and britta, first on a hill near the schauinsland and later at fritz's party in denzlingen, which was fucking awesome. most people i spend those birthdays with are people i am not in touch with any longer, for a multitude of reasons. last year, i spend the day pretty much alone.  tomorrow, i will spend the day with dirk. - there will be partying with the yoga people on tuesday, at silke's birthday party, how convenient for me, and there is no one else i feel the need to party with. dirk and i, we will head to the health department in the morning, for free hiv testing (isn't that a great birthday date?). dieter asked us to come by the laundromat to have a bottle of bubbly to celebrate my birthday as well, so we'll do that afterwards. then we'll quite likely take the bikes and find a lake or a field or a hill to lie around on or next to, picknicking and spending the day together. big time cycling might be out of the question: it looks like it is going to be above 35° again tomorrow, just like today, and the heat is mind-numbing and tiring. it will, doubtlessly, be a lovely day, just like these last days have been lovely.  what a year it has been, this last one. what a year will it be, this coming one? i can't wait for more of this change. time to leap into it.     chromatic i stand on the side of the road watching for a car a truck so I can go i've got to get myself out of this nothing place i've been running around with a tied shoe lace  what a year it has been what a year it has been lost my love shed my skin what a year it has been  there's a cheer leader squad on the side of the road cheering the night now for somewhere to go there's me on the corner the corner is home look at the controller we're about to hit a new zone  flashing lights from up above so close too close was crazy love so gather up your broken brow millions together will do it somehow  "what a year"  ~alex lloyd~

      i wonder why people want  things  in life, when they can have this love thing.  the last few days have been spend in complete and utter happiness, a happiness that is so all-surrounding, there is little place for anything else.  thursday night, dirk, michi, ute and i spend the night at a nearby lake. we swam at dusk, the light being unbelievably pretty, tinting everything golden, then pink, enhancing the green of the trees and the blue of the lake. we lit a fire, bbqed, drank, smoked and talked. i lay under a tree on the pebbly beach and looked up, seeing the stars between the leaves, dirk by my side. we slept under the stars, me cuddled up against dirk, near the fire, and i saw the shooting star i had wished for and made a wish.  when the sun was up, we swam again, naked, and i felt free and loved and just unbelievably content about where i was, who i was with, how i was feeling - all that despite being tired, despite having managed to be bitten by a flea (anyone wanting to scratch my stomach?), despite a slight sunburn.  it's fucking awesome, this love thing, it really is. it leaves me breathless and smiling like a lunatic, wanting nothing more than what i already have, yet at the same time making me realise that i can do anything and everything, being loved this way. it's making me re-discover sides of myself i had long forgotten about, and making me do things i never thought were me. - but they are. i am more myself than i have been in years. and it's all because of this love thing.  wow.     du, sagst du, ich bin kein mann für eine nacht, ich muss nur immer irre viel verreisen. heut hab ich mal drüber nachgedacht, deine chance ist da, ich kann es dir beweisen.  nimm mich mit, nimm mich mit, nimm mich mit, tommyboy auf das abenteuer liebe und so weiter! ich kanns sehn, es wird gehen,  es wird doppel-dreifach-schön mit dir als mein begleiter!  ich mal dir alle unsere möglichkeiten aus:  nordpol, südpol, grossstadt oder strand... am strand der ganze sand...  vielleicht lieber doch aufs land... bin jedenfalls schon so gespannt...  "nimm mich mit"  ~2raumwohnung~

      i asked  urlLink kyth  for five questions, you know, that meme thing. just because. and here they are. thanks, kyth.   1. what made you decide to be a lawyer?  well done kyth, tough one, this one. truth be told, i started doing law (and i am still not done yet, bad me, after all) because doing what i really wanted to do - journalism and writing, going to a certain journalism school in hamburg- didn't seem like an option when little me finished high school. my parents wouldn't have paid for it. i thought  "i'll do this, quickly, and then do what i really want to do" , because i was too young to go to that journalism school anyway, and because they liked people to have degrees there, anyway. somewhere along the line, in the middle of law school, if you will, i lost track and started to think -doubtlessly being borg-style assimilated by the mediocre people at law school- that i liked law, and wanted to do it. i even somehow started to think that i wanted the whole high paying, soul-stealing firm thing. so i worked at andersen, back when they hadn't sold their law department to ernst & young. it felt good, being the evil one, dressing up appropriately, what have you, but deep down i really really hated the work there, just being locked up in tiny  rooms without ever seeing clients, editing contracts worth 43 million euro. all the while, i hated law school, and never really got into the swing of things - it just didn't feel like my territory, my way of thinking, my passion. no wonder, really. a little while later, i discovered that i actually truly, genuinely  like  an area of law, intellectual property. i subsequently worked at two firms in melbourne, doing pretty much solely ip (once lots of technical stuff, once kinda glamourous and litigation heavy), and realised that yes, i can really do this law thing if i want to, i can enjoy this, actually, and it can be something i like doing. will i ever be a lawyer? i am not sure. i do know though that i will graduate, and what i will do then, i'll see. even if i continue on to do articles, i hope to take all those cool journalism school entrance exams i always wanted to take, just because. if i continue law, it might end up being ip, it might end up being something else. i realised sometime these past few days, that i might not feel good working in such a money-focused world, helping make rich folks richer. but i will see, i guess.   2. what was the most challenging thing you've ever done?  plan emigration to australia. and eventually let go of that plan. it was my dearest wish, my most important plan, for several years. it was my future, my entire future. at times, it felt like an unmanagable plan. - there was so much planning involved, so many things that needed consideration, that i lost track of the reason, the love that was supposed to be the reason for the move. it isolated and depressed me, and when it finally dawned on me how bad this plan was for me, it took several months to let go of it. but when i did, when i packed the brochures and the books and the leaflets on how to fill out your applications, it felt like a burden was lifted off my shoulders.   3. what do you believe in?  i believe in a higher, all-surrounding power that has many expressions and that is visible in every living thing. i believe in love, in the wisdom of the bhagavad gita, in the now.   4. given the choice: fame or fortune?  Why?  fortune. to -as cliche as it sounds- donate it to a good cause (something feminist, empowering, or human rights related) or my swamis ashram. who'd want fame? for what? i see little purpose and point in fame, and all those pop stars, pop idol shows, all those soaps, show that.   5. what are ten things you simply can't live without?  love, a small circle of close friends, yoga, books, music, blogging, dreams, a rigo every once in a while, living things around me, a bike.  if you want five, as well, leave a comment with email addie, and they shall come your way.

      coming home from the gym tuesday morning, pedalling slowly along my street (trying to avoid running into pedestrians), i saw him sitting in front of my house, waiting for me, fresh from his last but one abi exam.  the entire way home from gym i had wondered about going over to his place to see him: monday night had upset me quite a bit, with my silly issues and having made their little appearance for no real reason at all. but he was there, already, waiting for me. wow.   over lunch and cuddles and irresponsibilities that felt delightfully good, we figured it all out again, without stress and worries, and my issues dissolved into nothing again, just like they should. i discussed that issues stuff with silke tuesday night at yoga - she calls them  favourite emotions , and that's an appropriate term, i guess. in a way the guilt and inadequateness and the worry about pushy-ness  are  comfy. i know these emotions, i can resolve to them instead of really dealing -and possibly changing- the situation at hand. guilty as charged.  it's amazing and new and scaring the shits out of me to realise and accept how essential his presence already is for me. i've never let myself feel this way for anyone before, and right now it's hard to find a balance between that feeling and plain old common sense about relationships, not rushing into them at the start but retaining a sense of self and independence.  i've never had this before, i need to learn how to do it, this close, non-distance relationship thing. i need to figure out how to live, love, handle this intense all-consuming-head-over-heels-forever-love thing, which is as unbelievable as it is unique.  this is the kind of stuff that makes people run off to vegas. or so i think. this stuff makes me wonder why people  want  anything in this world. this love makes me feel so content and fulfilled i am almost completely need-less.  it will work, i have no doubts about that, but right now, alone at home and still awake this long past midnight (after a day of celebrating dirk's last exam with beer, prosecco, rigos, pot and natural highs) i feel just a tiny little bit lost, unsure about where my center is, where the balance is, where i belong in this all. i wonder what i need, and how all that will eventually work with his needs.    you can ask for anything you want/anything at all/and i'll understand it/and there are no strings attached to it.   i truly, honestly, deeply mean and feel that. however it's tricky to put to work. it's a little tricky to put to work if i have no idea what *i* need, or when what i think i need or want, or would like to have is completely counter to what he needs.  it's nothing fancy, this stuff. it's relationships 101, introductory lecture. easy business, basics, but to me, it's new, brandnew, because in all those ldrs i had, so many low quality compromises were made when together with silly  "well, soon we won't be together anymore, we shouldn't be argueing"  logic.  writing this, posting this, is blowing things a little out of proportion already. me wondering about my needs and his and how to work them out is nothing big, nothing to worry about, nothing bad. this is just me, full of all this warm, fuzzy emotionstuff for a tall blonde man with seefahrer eyes who's quite likely asleep in his bed just a few kilometres away. this is me feeling all this sitting at my computer, not sleeping next to him, which feels a little bit lonely.  i should just go to bed, and sleep, soon. and stop listening to  urlLink tex  singing "ich kann dich spüren". silly me.

      it's hard to realise how little it takes to bring up good old  issues . you know, that being pushy stuff. that not being enough stuff. that not making others happy stuff.  i hate it, yet can't turn off the litany in my head, even though i know it's not accurate, even though i know it is ridiculous, even though i slept over it.  i wish i could just snap out of it. ctrl-alt, del the programme. doesn't work though.

       from a recent email from a smart melbourne man:    "in the end though, you can't double-guess the future, and in relationships you have to trust the fact that your instincts and intuition are probably wiser than your head."    indeed.

       currently feeling: bittersweet.   hurting someone i care about because of feeling the way i do for someone else, is surreal, tearing at myself.  i have omitted things from the blog because of that. i wrote things these past weeks about my life, described scenes and moments, leaving him out. i read these sentences now, knowing he was there, wondering why i couldn't muster up the energy, the will for honesty, why i was such a coward. this here, this blog, describes my life. i write this for me. no one but me looks at it as often as i do, no one will look back at it as often as i do. i should, no, i want to be honest here, because i wasn't at opendiary, years ago, wasn't here for a while either, constructing an alternate reality in which evan and i were perfect and happy, an alternate reality in which all was well. i fooled myself: i don't want this again.  years from now, i will want to remember what waking up next to him is like, him usually being awake already, looking at me. i want to remember his  seefahrer  eyes, the taste of his skin, his long limbs and travellers and climber's body and skinniness, the soft golden hairs on his tan belly. i want to remember riding my bike along the river, on my way to his place on a hot summer sunday afternoon. i want to be able to bring up an image of us on my balcony at night. i want to remember looking into his eyes, holding his gaze. i want to write down our words, the one's we've reclaimed and analysed, the talk of vegas and white sheets and so much else.  but it is more than bittersweet to do so, here.

      herzlich willkommen:  urlLink jens - der literarische solist.   dirk's best and oldest friend, blogs, too. i've been sneak-reading his writings for a little while -  ever since dirk told me he knew all about online writing because his best friend was doing it, too, after i disclosed that i spend time online, doing this blogging thing. the three of us, dirk, jens and i, we had an entertaining little threesome phone call yesterday. i was at dirk's place when jens called to give him the thumbs up after seeing some pictures i had put online for dirk. in the process of our talk, i also got official permission to read and link. which is all fine and dandy. danke! it's a fine line to walk, this openess, this writing for many to see, especially if these are people i know or shall get to know in real life or people i love. tina was the first (besides evan, who never used it) to be given access, and since then, i've come a long way. opening up, being honest always means opening up for potential hurt and pain, risking showing "too much", whatever that "too much" is.  but there is no other way than this.

      it's hard to admit having made mistakes, especially if that mistake was not being totally honest, especially considering how much i've been waxing on lately about honesty and its importance. it doesn't make it better that i lied by omission. it doesn't make it better that i did so thinking i was protecting your feelings, when i was doing the exact opposite.  being blunt and honest is the greatest thing to show one cares. i care a lot about you, i have for ages, but when i noticed how much even bits of the truth hurt you, i was a coward and resolved to self-censoring here, to ommitting what was happening in my head and my heart when talking to you.  it hurts me to hurt you, because this is so late, this being honest, but there was no other way. i wish i had real reasons, excuses, but i don't.

      evan called last weekend.  the two conversations we've had since we've broken up have been better than any we've had since i returned from melbourne mid-january. it was strange to talk to him in a way, because there is, quite simply, little left to say. a day or two before, i had send him a short list of things i had left in australia (expecting to see them again sometime this year) which i want him to send me. there was a little bit of bile in that email, doubtlessly: i mentioned the condoms in his closet which i bought last year, and asked him to throw them away. i hate(d) the thought of him having sex with someone else with condoms i paid for. but then, i should be happy if he used them, shouldn't i, considering he was unable to purchase any himself. dear me, what made me stay with a man too fucked up to buy condoms?  our talk, however, was surprisingly bile-free. - for me, there is little left to be bitter about anymore.  for the first time ever, evan was honest when we talked: he said outright that he never wanted me to move to australia, and didn't feel comfortable with the plan, ever.  i got honest, too, telling him i had gathered that much from his behaviour (not accepting my proposed solution for the money issue, not reading immigration material, etc.), and told him that while i could at least kinda see his reasoning, i couldn't understand it, couldn't accept why he didn't want to do anything about those things that were on his mind, why he never mentioned his doubts. i made him listen to all the hints that had been there, made him listen to the terrible thoughts his behaviour had given me, let him tell me my observations were right. i told him that if there were any parallels between my behaviour and jen's (his ex), like he claimed in january, it wasn't because he managed to pick up two similarly fucked up women in a row, but because his behaviour caused a certain kind of behaviour in return.  i am starting to be happy we broke up now, and not in a few months, closer to my intended departure, even though this was close enough. i am happy this didn't happen after i packed. i am happy this didn't happen after my move. i am happy this didn't happen after a marriage and children, which is not out of the realm of possibility. i might have kept being quiet about my worries for a few more years, he might have kept quiet, too, and we would have been a terrible, terrible couple in return.  it hurt, and it still hurts a little, every once in a while, like when my grandma asked about evan, when the woman in a cafe in hometown asked me when we'd get married -  straight after your graduation? , when my aunt asked about when evan would come, i told her he wouldn't, which kicked off a 2 hour monologue about break-ups.  it is better this way, it truly is.  i deserve more than this distance thing which poisoned my life, which made me shut down my life, in so many ways, big and small, from cutting myself off from friends, to losing track of my studies, to not repairing my bike because it wasn't worth it. i deserve to be loved. i deserve someone who cherishes me and my body, who makes me feel safe and wanted and loved.  i've started to believe that the distance was one of the reasons why i entered into my last two big relationships, with didi and evan, who both lived far away. it might sound insane, but fact is, i like control, need control, and in those ldrs, i probably (subconsciously) controlled how much i revealed of myself, even when i really didn't feel very much in control. i kept secrets from both partners, too, big secrets. idealisation played a big role in either relationship. both relationship started out as one night stands, and proceeded to deepen because i pushed for it. one of the reasons that i was with didi was probably because i wanted to lean on someone during the major life change of starting law school and moving away, without being tied down locally. as mentioned before, one of the reasons i was with evan, was that i needed to get away from a superficial life i hated and needed an escape -australia-, too.  letting go of control has been an issue for me for quite a while. i am scared that the real caro (whoever she is, whatever she is like) is not lovable or desirable. my ocd personality has made even minute things, like letting someone else do my dishes or make my bed or cook dinner in my kitchen, almost impossible. - it's been worse when letting someone take control of a situation, of my life. strangely enough letting go has started to feel better to me. sure, i notice myself noticing when i am letting go, like when dirk does dishes after i cooked dinner, but i *am* letting go, letting it be, not stressing about the right way that my dishes have to be done. i am letting go of wanting to be perfect. i show my insecurities and make myself vulnerable, even after i failed, like i did on wednesday night.  things are over with evan. and it is better this way. i am growing and learning and changing, and will not make the same mistakes twice, or rather: a third time. i will not hide in an ldr again.

      southern germany is under a heatwave at the moment: it's been well into the mid thirties every day for the last two weeks. - when i arrived back here tuesday afternoon, getting out of the air-continioned train, the heat was as intense as standing in front of an open oven. - it's mind-numbing, this heat, and it turns getting things done into quite an ordeal. - and there is lots needing to be done in my life right now.  i've been extraordinarily busy since returning: i spend several hours yesterday driving around with tina, who needed to buy a fan (which i should really think about getting, too), and had offered to take me to a garden center to buy plants for my balcony, while she was at it. we were successful, after a good 4 hours, and 5 stores, and i was totally drained, thirsty, and hurting afterwards, because i managed to get myself three blisters from my birkenstocks. good grace.  however, my balcony is a much friendlier, much more colourful place now.  on the windowstill, there is a large  urlLink lavender , next to a container with a pink  urlLink geranium , flanked by  urlLink alysum . there are two small containers with  urlLink daisies  and orange  urlLink osteospermums , next to a  urlLink sunflower  i got from dirk today, and another container with a red  urlLink geranium  flanked by  urlLink lobelia . in the sunniest corner of the balcony is a container with a really lovely  urlLink oleander , which is just getting ready to bloom, next to my mamillaria nivosa cactus. i saw a lovely gardenia at the store, too, but at 12, i can't really afford it's sweet smelling floweriness. or can i?  apart from that, there was laundry that needed to be done and i finally managed to drag my bike to the repair shop. 72 later, i had a functional bike again (even though the bike has a date for a much needed complete overhaul next week). it's a life changing thing, having a functional bike again, i never repaired it, because of the lame "i'll be going away to australia" excuse. but then: right now, it ain't functional anymore, anyway: i managed to run into a piece of glass right here in front of my house on the way back from the store, and the back tire is flat again. yeah. i didn't swear though or whine: it was quite simply way too funny. dirk will repair it tomorrow, too, blessed be his manual talents, considering the 18 gears my bike has, it would take me ages to get it done, and get it done correctly.  i'm quite happy how calm and happy and well i am, and that i've been doing good stuff for myself, too, despite all that busy-ness since returning. i feel much more like myself than i have in ages, it seems i am re-discovering parts of myself that got lost under the caro i was when with evan. i spend much less time online these past days than in months, and as a not so good side effect, i've been quite unreliable when calling people when i've said i'd do so, because i'm so busy living, filling my days with life. the highlight of the afternoon was sitting in grünwälderstrasse with dieter and reza after picking up my laundry, our feet in the bächle (the little streams of water running through the city), sipping afri cola. people passing by smiled about us. - legend says that if you step into a bächle, you'll have to marry a local. - i wonder whether that pertains to voluntary stepping in, too. no matter what, i am lost anyway: i stepped in twice already anyway. dirk came over last night, too, when all was done for the day, and we sat on the balcony after the nightly thunderstorm, enjoying the cool breeze. the sky was breathtakingly beautiful and tinted pink before the almost full moon came up. we listened to a mix tape i made years ago, talked, and for the first time in years, i was a bad lawyer-to-be, but a relaxed chick and inhaled, which was nice. i guess there are some things one never un-learns, like cycling. or inhaling, deeply. he.  today was a much more relaxed day than yesterday, it was too warm to move anyway. it's been a hanging around kinda day, but that was much needed. i realised i can't get the thought of bod mod out of my head. somehow, i want to mark myself, mark how well i am again, how happy. my cartilage piercing marked my being in new zealand, my belly button marked fighting against depression (and in a way was the opening bell to the end with evan, even though that was almost 2 years ago). the thought of a nipple piercing is still there, but i still think it would not look particularly good on my type of breasts and nipples, and just today, i looked at some pics of infected nipple piercings on  urlLink bme , which were quite the turn-off. if not a piercing, maybe ink then? it's tempting, very tempting, even more so since it seems as if everyone i meet these days is inked, too, and i've gotten up close and personal with the tats, admiring what they feel like. i'll take my time though, or at least try to: i got the cartilage one on a whim, and while i longed for 7 years for the belly button piercing, i went and got an appointment an hour before getting it. who knows what i'll do now - there are various people here in town who are good tattoo artists.   i'm a changed me, and i love it.

      pride is a strange thing. inside myself, it is linked to insecurity.  tina and i watched  urlLink out of africa  tonight, and we cried at the end of it, as usual, from when  urlLink karen  asks  urlLink denys  for a dance to make another memory she can torture herself with (or even earlier, actually, when denys talks about mating for life, one day at a time), to when the lions sit on finch hattons grave. the movie brought up one of my recent issues way too well: unconditional love as letting go, love without strings attached.  you owe me nothing in return.   afterwards, with tina gone, i wasted time online, being too proud to make a phone call that might have eased my mind, too proud, too, to hop on a tram to get some company and conversation. - i waited till it was too late for either.  all just because i got insecure, all out of a sudden.  it's a little as if walls went up around myself, to protect me and prevent me from showing too much, from getting too close. a call now would show i care, care more than i say i do, maybe. a call right now might be too much, too close, too clingy.  honesty shows how much i care for someone, but tonight i am not honest to someone i care about: i don't call, even though i want to. i am playing games in a way, and it doesn't feel good, being mixed up with my insecurity and my pride. i want to love with my hand outstretched, offering, but right now, i am scared of getting hurt, scared of rejection.  i will make myself talk about it, tomorrow, when my pride and insecurity have calmed down, when pure, blunt honesty feels right again, when i've caught up on much needed sleep the lack of whose is surely clouding my mind right now, when this balmy night is over.

      the minute i arrive, i get criticised by the mother, my headaches kick back in, and i start reaching for food for comfort. i should, quite simply, not come to see the parents, unless there are pressing reasons to do so.  it's been a stressful and annoying few days, and i can't wait until it is 9:20am tomorrow, and i'll be on my way back home. dirk will pick me up at the train station, there will be yoga that afternoon and dinner afterwards, and jazz ohne stress at night. i have a week off, too, and can finally plant stuff on my balcony. i will have my life back. hooray!

      i'm tired today, and thinking too much.  i don't know when and why exactly my mood changed today, from yesterday evenings happiness, but it did, and now i am sitting here feeling blue.  i'll be going up to hometown tomorrow, and i really don't want to and have no idea why i am going, besides having said so since easter.  but the train tickets have been purchased and it would be 30 to hand them back in, i have an appointment to get my hair cut on friday, an appointment with the health insurance guy on friday as well, and need to buy clothes, urgently, which one can't really do round here.  starting friday, i have a week long holiday from uni, and apart from all the stuff i already organised, i'd rather stay here, work out, be around people i like. instead i will have 5 stressful days with the parents, and i am in no mood to deal with them at all. they will ask too much about graduating and finals. they will ask about evan. they will ask about jack. they will ask about daniel and dirk. my mother will make comments on my looks.  they will quite simply ask too many questions i don't feel like answering at all.  my mother thinks i am unhappy, and keeps telling me that i am. she's also complaining that i've changed, and don't have time for her anymore. and i have changed, and i don't have time for her anymore. - i am busy having a life, being around people, for a change. she seems to be very upset, and told me today that she felt like i  "didn't want to deal with them anymore"  which is silly parental rhethoric. they'll be visiting in three weeks, why see them now?  but well, there is nothing to be changed now, i'll be leaving at midday tomorrow. i still need to pack, and i don't feel like it at all. but i got to start, sooner rather than later because i'll be out tonight, to a lecture by sumaya farhat-naser, a palestinian peace activist who i've admired for a good long while because i read all her books. dirk is coming along, and i am quite sure that i will need a few beers on my balcony in his company after the lecture.  i fear that the next few days will be draining instead of relaxing, and i am already running low on energy anyway.  in the past, going home was always a refuge, always another way to flee from life here, and right now, i really don't have anything to flee from. which is good.

      apparently, saturn is moving into cancer today, and that seems to have a major impact on pretty much everyone.  scarily enough, my horoscope relating to that special event in (and i am deeply sorry for that: purchased when bored at london city airport for several hours)  urlLink new woman  is spot on. it's all about change.  and i don't even believe in horsocopes.

      last night, dirk and i went out to  urlLink jazz ohne stress , a weekly session type jazz performance at  urlLink waldsee , a local pub thing.  it was absolutely fucking awesome. we sat outside by the lake, drinking beer in a warm, but not too humid summer evening, the music tripping to our ears from inside. past 11, it got too chilly so we moved inside and watched and listened to the musicians playing perfect music for a perfect evening. i had a rigo and sat in amazement listening to the premiere of a song the sax player had written to mark his son's birth.  when i got home, thunderstorms started. lying in bed, i watched lightning flashes, counting the seconds till the thunder hit, being incredibly happy about where i am right now, and who surrounds me.  i wouldn' t want to have it any other way.

      i've been thinking about love a lot this past week, as one does, at the end of a relationship.  whiny thoughts of the  "i will never be able to love this way ever again"  have been rare. fact is, i will never love the way i loved evan ever again, because it was such a lonely, unhealthy, clingy kind of love. so often, it left me sad and drained instead of energised and happy. it wasn't always bad, but it simply wasn't good most of the time.  i loved him, feverishly, to no avail. i always tried to love more, harder, more intensely, trying to convince him to love me back. i smothered him in caresses, attention, presents, hoping for a few crumbs of love in return, but rarely got any. i kept moving closer, closing up my eyes to his moving away from me. i cherished his body, knew every square centimeter of his skin and made love to it, while my body remained unloved, untouched by him.  i will never be able to love that way again.  right now, i feel unbelievable amounts of love for so many friends near and far, and strangely enough, the love i feel is open and without boundaries.  instead of closing up, trying to protect myself after this recent bit of heartbreak, heartbreak that lasted 3 1/2 years, i love even more intensely already. - and it's unlike anything i have ever felt before. it's clear, see-through, flowing, open and pure. it's caring intensely, while letting go, letting be, whatever it may be.  instead of clutching my fist around love so that it can't escape, i turn my hand upwards, open my hand and offer it.  it feels unbelievably good.

      i've had a bit of a life this weekend. i worked out lots, spend time with tina, met kathrin, talked to  urlLink jack  a few times, spend a big chunck of sunday sitting on a hill in the sun with dirk. in short, i was quite the happy girl enjoying summer, and now have the slight sunburn to prove it. ack. ambre solaire 30+ (whose smell gives me flashbacks of my last trip to oz) didn't last throughout the afternoon. while i shall forget some things about aussie life, just so it doesn't hurt that much, i shall not forget the lessons learned about sunscreen and protective clothing, just so burned shoulders won't hurt so much, either.  i am dealing with the changed evan situation quite well. i though i'd get angry at some point, like people do when grieving, but so far, that anger is nowhere to be seen. maybe it's because i got so angry weeks, months even, before those last words were said, who knows. right now, i am honestly happy for him having an opinion and mainly think it is his loss, that he won't be coming over again, his loss for not making a final try or at least saying a final goodbye, his loss fpr missing out on a much improved, much happier me, in the best physicial shape i have ever been. his loss, really.  am i still sad? in some ways, yes. yesterday, i showed dirk a book i thought he might like, tim winton's "an open swimmer", and when i opened it, two scraps sof paper, which i had used as bookmarks, fell out: one was a receipt from dymocks geelong, where i had bought the book, the other a scrap of paper from geelong hospital, with evans full name, his pager number and password on it. it was strange to see his name on that bit of paper, and it made me sad, too. i can see him taking it out of his breastpocket when coming home in the evening, putting it on his bedside table (the one that i reworked), with his hospital id, pens, pager and all the other stuff he usually carried around.  it's sad how many things, big and small, will be different now.  it is such a giant thing to not be moving to melbourne anymore because of him, even though i am well aware that if i want to, i still can. our relationship was so many things besides the two of us. it was driving around singing along to u2. it was watching the bombers play. it was lots of music, something for kate, looking for cds at jb hifi. it was our two different languages. it was making love in all the rooms of his new house. it was cooking certain meals together. it was flying across the world. it was melbourne in all its glory. it was getting to know geelong. it was running along the river and working out together. it was being picked up in moonee ponds with pretzels. it was rituals we had. it was the poses he would strike when i walked into the bathroom while he showered.  i miss these things now, too, and the memories of these things keep hitting me, in strange moments. saturday afternoon, i did my usual ab exercises, and realised he taught them to me. friday, i couldn't get the view of downtown coming from ascot vale out of my head. i can't listen to lots of music.  besides all that, i had started to built a life in melbourne. i had my very own colleagues and friends, i had my own footie team that i knew and loved and cheered till my throat was sore, i knew my way around the courts and the libraries, i had my own phone number and voice mail, i was registered as a blood donor, i could navigate the city, i had applications for schools, i had taken my ielts, i knew which suburb i wanted to live in, the barista at the local coffee place knew me. i was a local, at least a little.  and now all that is gone, too, and that hurts as much as not having evan in my life anymore, which is quite sad in itself. how did he, did we get lost along the way? how and why did all these things start to matter so much?

      i am going up north to see the parents tomorrow. am not exactly happy about the whole thing, really, but my grandma has been in hospital since thursday. she's scheduled for an op on monday, to remove dead tissue on her foot. at 93, full fledge anesthesia is a risky business, and considering i wasn't there for her birthday two weeks ago, an emergency trip is in order. i really hate the  "i am visiting because you might die in this"  stuff, but that's it, really, in a way, and i am not thrilled. apart from the bad rason to go up north, the train trip ain't gonna be fun, either: i've got cystitis (if this is a light one, as my doc told me, i'd never wish a severe on upon anyone, ever), and that train ride should be fun. am catching an ice train, just because they've got the nicer loos, and my tip will only be about 4 hours. and i'll arrrive on time to see the tour arrive in paris, too.  it's almost all organised, only need to pack now and clean a little, which i will do while watching today's time trial, the most exiting day in tour history since the  urlLink legendary last stage battle between lemont and fignon in 1989 . dirk will come over, too, for his first full afternoon of tour coverage. later, (after lance has enlarged the time gap between him an ullrich, i hope), i'll only have to find a home for my plants. i hope andrea can look after them, talk to them, water them.  it's still all chit chat, what i am writing. too much happening in my head, too much stuff on my mind, and i feel too sick anyway. off to watch the tour, which will be nail-bitingly exciting. may it lighten up my life.

      i'm kinda speechless these days.  it's the heat and the mid-airish-ness of not knowing where my balance is, i guess, and just life in general, with all its changes. i haven't seen dirk since sunday: lovely  urlLink jens  is still in town, and the two of them needed some time together, and that was -of course- just fine with me. what was bizarre, and felt kinda ridiculous, though, was being on the phone with dirk in the evening, just 10 minutes away, both of us missing/wanting/needing each other, yet neither of us just hopping on our bikes to make the contact immediate. it felt like punishment. or something.  who ever said that absence makes the heart grow fonder was a liar.  i'll drive over to dirk's place in a short little while, to see jens off at the train station in the early afternoon. it's a bit of a bummer that we didn't get more time together, but i am sure this wasn't the last time we'll meet.  i've used this little bit of lone time, too, studying, watching the tour, doing yoga, casually looking for a job (found a 6 day research stint at the commerce department which would pay 100 per day, applied, and am now crossing my fingers), applying for a seminar in september with silke, going to jazz ohne stress with tina last night. she's indeed leaving in three weeks, to spend the next 6 months preparing for finals at her parent's place. i don't think that's a good idea at all, but if she thinks she needs parental supervision to actually study, i hope it'll work for her. it surely wouldn't for me. she found someone to rent her place for those 6 months yesterday, so it is going to be real, her move, and that's strange going to be strange for me, because no matter how often i've whined about her since we've re-united, she  is  an exceptional friend to have around, and having her back in my life has made an enormous difference. her move will make an enormous difference in my life now, too.  i am speechless. this writing is just chit-chat, nothing more, and it annoys me, really, that my voice is gone for now, and that my need to write, too. it will return, of that i am sure. i just wish i had something to say. i wish this life limbo was over.

      what has been making mondays so strange lately? i wonder, really. for some bizarre reason, the last few mondays have all been low days, and today is no exception.  it's still this  finding a balance  thing that i've been mentioning for a while now, i guess. i bet the best thing would be to not stress and to relax instead, but that's hard, when my favourite emotions come creeping up again.  welcome fave emotions, hang around, we'll have a good time, my darlings! hello guilt. hello selfdoubt. hello selfhate. so lovely to see you here, settle down and have a drink with me.  it's silly, really, to feel responsible for other people's feelings and emotions and matters, and i should, quite simply, just snap out of wanting to control it all, and let things be and take words as they are spoken, without too many interpretations. too bad that i've never been  good at that. too bad i've never been too good at recognising my needs either.  it's no big deal, overall. but it's a tad bit annoying that mondays  make me sad. and that i am feeling sulky and stupid knowing i am just that, sulky and stupid and that feeling and acting that way is childish and totally counter productive.  am still not taking better care of myself better, still nowhere near figuring out my needs. i need to do both and remember to just  love  above it all, which i do, anyway. loving is easy, after all.  at least  urlLink lance  showed good form today. that's something to love, too.

      there's been little to say and little desire to come up with sparkly written stuff: life is simple, love-filled, bloody damn good, and time passes, quickly, too quickly, to sit down for writing.  there's been much loving this week, the summer, the heat, the tour for entertainment, an excellent therapy session on wednesday, and lots of yoga, too.  the weekend shall be good, too: jens will be arriving in just about 2 hours, and i'm excited about meeting him for the first time tomorrow, for brekkie: the boys shall have a night to catch up before i come into the equation. the downtown street party is on outside my door, and for the first time in years, i am not annoyed, but excited about live music and people and fun right downstairs. it sure is loud till late (there was noise till 2am this morn), but the mornings are quiet, because the delivery trucks usually waking me up at ungodly hours can't get through. oh, heaven: sleeping in with dirk by my side, after a past midnight joint, and a 90 minute tour de france docu on arte.  so yeah, i am repeating myself: but i love life, this july.

      i'm in housewifey clean-up overload. and i love it.  it's going to be a lovely day. - not just because my place will be super tidy and shiny and new at the end of it,  the first mountain stage of the  urlLink tour  is happening all day to keep me company and entertain me, as i dust my book shelves and wash my windows. yeah. i threw tons of stuff and random papers away yesterday, chatting to tina while deciding what to keep and what to chuck, and it's amazing how much better i feel the more i throw away, the leaner, cleaner and tidier my place gets.  it's good to have some time for myself this weekend, and so much of it, too, even though i am not doing anything really exciting with it. i need it, this down time, this taking stock and being homey and watching the tour, hoping that  urlLink lance  will be in yo-yo at the end of the weekend (if not today).  oh, life. in july. lovely.

      dirk came over at 8am, having just missed the train to luzern he and his brother had wanted to take.  our disagreement yesterday about the details of the trip (and whether i should know such details as to what country they were going and what day they might be returning) had been short and ridiculous, but hurtful nonetheless. -it ruined my day, completely, and left me angry with myself and him and everything. - and wondering about the line between free love and letting someone treat me poorly. it felt ridiculous and pointless, because i was happy for him and wishing him well for his travels with his brother, and knew that he was still tired and hungover from the night before, and that i had sounded controlling and silly, too.  he walked up the staircase to my door, this morning, his pack on his back, and brekkie from the bakery for me in his hands, and we hugged, and kissed, and we both said our sorries and apologies, and later kissed and loved and apologised some more until it was well again. our bodies had to do some of the talking. it means so much to me that he came over this morning, that he brought my fave brekkie, that he made the first step and that we got to have a good goodbye.  it was all very good, and much needed, too.  so yeah. still learning, still working on finding a balance. guess it'll take a while. but that's fine.

      i donated blood yesterday.  sitting in the lab room, waiting that the nurse getting got ready to take my blood pressure, body temp and hb, i chat with her, telling her i am curious what my hb will be like because it was too low to doante last time. she asks me whether i am   "in the field" , medical personnel. - it's a question i hear quite often when at the docs: it's caused by the type of language i use when talking about medical issues, i guess, and by the type of things i ask and know. it happens when you date a doc for 3+ years: you start using that kind of language.  before my brain switches in, i reply  "no, i'm not in the medical field, but my partner is a doc." .  uh-oh.  as i say that sentence, i realise that wasn't the case anymore, and cringe. i tell myself that correcting that mistake isn't worth it, because i'll share a total of five minutes with the nurse and most likely never see her again. little do i know what kind of discussion she'll get into though.   "so what do you do?"  she asks me  "i'm a lawyer-to-be." , i tell her, as i lean my arm on the padded cushion, so she can take my blood pressure. as she puts the sleeve around my arm, simultaenously pops a thermometer in my ear and continues her examination of me she informs me  " i really don't want to upset you, but i have to tell you that i think lawyers and doctors really make shabby couples."   uh? pardon me?  the nurse gets into a big fat talk about how incompatible lawyers and doctors are in regards to love and even included examples about every doc and lawyer couple she ever knew.  it is quite a funny situation, actually. i sit there in my chair, being examined, pretty much silent, smiling to myself and silently agreeing with her on things such as work dedication and frame of mind being obstacles for good doctor/lawyer relationships. but i can't tell her it is behind me, that struggle, and that i really don't need or want her advice, because i ditched the doctor several weeks ago.   "how long has it been going on?"  she asks, after scribbling my exam results on my donation form (bp as high as ever, temp 36.8, hb 14,4 on second taking, after 11,7 the first time. uh? odd.) and as i get ready to leave the room, i tell her  "three and a half years." .   "that's quite a while." , she replies.  "good luck then. but if things go wrong, don't let that passed time stand in the way of leaving, yes?"   i nod, thank her, and head for the room where the doc will have a final look at me before 500ml of blood will move from my bod into a plastic bag.  i don't need any more luck, or that kind of advice anymore. found that one out myself, after all. that's what i call luck.

        urlLink friday five!     1. do you remember your first best friend? Who was it?  my first best friend was anna, the daughter of one of my mom's friends. they lived just around the corner. anna is a year younger than me, and we have pictures showing us together from her birth on. we spend our childhoods together, cycled around our village, later hung out at starlight express as young teens, travelled to the uk various times, spend a summer in spain.   2. are you still in touch with this person?  no. anna and i, we lost touch in the years after i moved down here. we last met in 1999, when she visited, and we noticed that we had hardly anything in common anymore. it had been approaching for years, that break-up of sorts, because during the second half of our teenage years, it became obvious that our interests were very different, after all.   3. do you have a current close friend?  yes. my dearest tina, in faraway graz. i haven't seen her in a year, because i was always out of the country when she was in town, and just haven't manaed to travel to her end of europe yet. but i'll hopefully, hopefully see her next month! yay! finally! and well, there is dirk, but that's different. :)   4. how did you become friends with this person?  i met tina in the first year here in town. we were neighbours, living on the same floor: she lived alone, i shared a flat with the flatmate from hell. over the months, she spend more and more time at my place, hanging out almost every night, eating pasta and rice pudding, watching the telly and talking about our days. oh, the old days.   5. is there a friend from your past that you wish you were still in contact with? why?  yes. many friends, actually. when i got depressed, three years ago, i cut off ties to many good friends from the past (many of them from the exchange), for no real reason at all. i miss timm, for example. and chris. and so many others. one of these days, i should kick myself in the butt, and get back in touch. - because all those i am back in touch with again (like mic, and local tina), were lovely and cool about having me back in their lives.

      i looked at him today, sitting on my balcony, and waited, trying to figure out where i fit into the plans he was telling me about  it didn't and doesn't feel good, that waiting thing. -  it's cowardly. and all just because i am getting scared by living in the now.  thing is: i love dirk. i love him so much it is turning my head and my life and my heart upside down. so much i think and feel things i don't feel comfy posting here because they are so insane, after this short while, so intense, too: love making (in the truest sense of the word), life, babies and forever and always. it's insane, but feels so bloody damn good. today, i had trouble letting that love be, letting it take whatever way it will go, had trouble letting dirk be and accept his choices and that he might be going away.    "you can ask for space for yourself/and only yourself and i'll grant it/you can ask for freedom as well/or time to travel and you'll have it/you can ask to live by yourself/or love someone else and i'll support it/you can ask for anything you want/anything at all and i'll understand it/and there are no strings attached to it"    today, that didn't work, really, that didn't feel ok. my first impulse was to lock myself up, stop wanting, caring, loving to avoid possible hurt.  all just because i got scared. scared by the intensity of it all, scared by the future, scared by what it will be like if he does go away, well knowing that there is no alternative to letting him go if he choose to, letting him do whatever he feels like doing. deep down inside i know i will be okay, if he goes away. i know my love won't end with that, i know that even if it does, one day, it will be good to look back at it and know that i experienced this love, in its intensity. but today, the one wish dominating it all was the one for permanence.  i want this to last. i really really want this to last. i want him.  it's so silly to want him, because i "got" him, after all (or so he tells me), and the only thing that counts is today, is the now. i know that it is normal this longing for permanence, but right now, it's poisonous and wrong. - we're both figuring out where to go and what to do with our lives: this is not the time for putting chains and limitations on each other. and his freedom, the travelling, the adventures make him the man that he is, the man that i love.  but where do i fit in? what do i want from him, from life? where do i want my life to be?  i still haven't figured out any of that, still haven't found a balance between life and this love thing, still haven't progressed much regarding my life plans. i don't know what to do about my insecurities and fears, i know i need to look them in the eyes and convince them they have no basis and are pointless, because all there ever is is the now, and that i am blessed and happy for all that *is* in the now right now.  it will work out, i know it. i will figure out my path, live in the now, stand up to those fears and insecurities, let him be and i and it all will be fine. but right now, it seems kinda overwhelming.  this love thing is truly turning it all upside down and inside out.

      sunday night, 7pm. location:  urlLink zmf . weather: 23°C, sunshine, light wind. summer has returned, after a week of much needed rain.  tina and i sat on the hill behind the large tent, on a checked plaid, with tomatoes & mozzarella, warm bread, veges & dips, ice cold wine and mousse au chocolate for dessert, listening to  urlLink carl orff's carmina burana  in all it's paradoxical, passionate, percussion glory. we chatted whenever the soprano sang because her voice hardly left the tent, read along to the lyrics in the grande moments and swayed and yo-ed in tune, too, and had the most delightful evening in ages. the sun set over the kaiserstuhl in time with the reprise of "oh fortuna", and we later cycled home, well fed and well entertained.  summer. wow. have i mentioned before how much i love july?

      i love my life. and july.  i am in love like i never thought possible. dirk came over late wednesday night and stayed till this morning when it was time for school, because we were unable to say goodbye last night. he went to school in the work pants he had worn wednesday afternoon and my villa maria rugby shirt.  the  urlLink tour  starts tomorrow, and i've got my day firmly planned around the broadcast of the prolouge. hell, i've got the next two weeks firmly planned around the tour.  i re-potted my sunflowers today.  i worked out, for the first time since the bike crash and the heat, and loved it, and chatted nicely with folks at the gym.  there are many good people, near and far, that i care about, and who care about me.  i am slowly but surely figuring out what i want to do with my life.  mic is coming over tonight, and i'll be cooking chicken in djion-mustard curry sauce, followed by jamie oliver's mousse au chocolate.  it's been raining for almost three days straight, and between showers, the air is fresh, the sky is washed clear, and the clouds are fluffy and white.  i love my life, this july.

      how come, by the way, that once goodstuff starts happening in your life, you attract more goodstuff? like good people, for example?  i am so happy about all those fantastic, interesting people who have recently popped up in my life, and about what has been happening through and with them. there's dirk, of course, and all his friends that i am just getting to know. there's  urlLink jens  calls within hours of me thinking about talking to him, as does tina. i had a lovely evening with my new downstairs neighbour andrea. unexpected snail mail from gabriel, who i met on the plane to montreal, arrived today, and when i pick it up at the post office (oversized envelope and all), i run into mic, whom i haven't seen in 18 months or so, but whom i thought about just last week. - we're meeting up tomorrow.  wow. lucky me.

      i keep looking at dirk, in disbelief, totally speechless, because of what i feel for him, what he feels for me, how happy i am, how happy we are. he leans on me, cuddles up to me, and it feels like home. i am wide open and in shock because of this fantastic intimacy thing, so breathtaking and sexy and the biggest turn-on i can imagine. it's all so bloody damn good.  wow.  this morning, being awake way too early (last nights vino consumption with andrea ruined my sleep cycle), dirk sleeping wrapped around me, what had happened last night, happened just like that, feeling fabulous and exciting and new, was still super present in my head. a bit of worry crept in, stunned worry at the intensity of it all, and wonder about whether it's good, the way we're doing all this, so intensely, so immediate, without holding back. can there be too much of this intimacy thing, too much, too soon, too few boundaries?  "if we have all this, share all this, do all this already, might we run out of things to share in the not too distant future?   in the light of day, and after a few more hours of sleep and thinking, i reckon that those thoughts this morning were subconscious catholic girl shame (long thought under control) backlashashing, coupled with fear of getting hurt and me sabotaging my own happines (as usual). the first being the result of years of parental and societal conditioning and the last remnants of body shame and taboo still there, the latter the result of past hurt.  if i stop the thoughts and take time to  feel  what is there, i know it is right, though, all of it. it feels perfect and amazing and fantastic. this is what i always hoped, wanted love to be, to feel like. this immediateness, this intimacy.  and now that it's here, now that i feel it, i need to get my head around this happiness and bliss and intimacy. but i am getting there. and i can't imagine us running out of anything any time soon.

      as we walked along kaiser-josef-strasse yesterday morning, holding hands, dirk planted his right, flip-flop clad foot accidentally, but firmly and completely nonetheless, into a  urlLink bächle .  legend has that when that happens, you'll marry a local.  do i count as a local, after 6 years here? the jury is still out on that one, but nonetheless, i couldn't help laughing, and kept telling him throughout the day that he was  verloren  now. he insisted that he had  gewonnen  though, instead.  he.

      i bought a  urlLink moleskine  yesterday. a5, ruled. an expensive beautiful piece of stationary art it is, awaiting  words and ideas to be expressed between its pages.  it's going to be my first paper diary in years, 4 years, or 5, i am not so sure.  it will be an experiment to write on paper again. it currently feels like i will take a break from writing online for a while. how long, i can't say. maybe a few days. or a few weeks. - quite likely not for good though: this got so important over the years, i don't think i'll quit completely, ever. but right now, i need to take stock and find words again, in my mother tongue, on paper, where only dirk and i will read them. there has been change, so much change these last months, this year, that i need my thoughts for myself, and myself alone, without an audience besides dirk.  it hasn't felt quite right to write here for a while now. i've been inspirationless. i don't like the semi-publicity of this at the moment. i don't like that evan started reading after ignoring it for years. overall it just doesn't feel like it used to, to write here. i want to remember and re-discover the joy of writing and chronicling, i want to be honest, and i think it will have to be the old fashioned way, slow writing, with a pen, and paper.  this is not goodbye (yet). but this onlinething has got competition now, my lovely moleskine, still virginal and empty. so very much unlike this thing here.

      i got the 600 for 6 days work marketing job from uni. yay.  after the initial interview the week before last, i was told i got it. mid last week came an email informing me that no, i couldn't join, they were only taking marketing students. early this morning, however, came a call from sylvie, the organsier, and a final ok. i just got back from the first planning session.  it's going to be funky: it will involve interviewing customers to identigfy the value of a brand, a bit of travelling and work at 3 shops near stuttgart, and three overnight stays at hotels that i can pick. started planning already. oh, schwaben.  it's going to be a cultural experience. he. :)   (and all is fine and dandy with dirk. it really is. few things a mid-day talking-kissing-undressing can't make better.)

      that's what you get for wanting the moment to last:  dirk is going home up north, for a few weeks at the end of the month, when the lease of the flat he shares with kolja ends. he wants and needs time with his family, and life down here is awfully expensive, and he hasn't got a job yet, nor an internship.  it's fine. of course it is.  but it still hurts, for reasons that have little do to with him, and so much more to do with me, and past hurt. i worry that he'll forget me and that what we have will turn abstract while he's gone. i worry that he will get a fabulous internship in a great place (which i really hope he will get), but will head out to south america or new zealand or wherever welse, without seeing me again. i worry so much, made a silly scene last night, for no reason at all.  this just hits all my buttons, his leaving, brings up all my fave emotions, even though i consciously know it ain't a big deal at all, and that we'll be fine, that he'll have enough of home in a short little while, and that it'll work out. but today, i'm still feeling kinda blue.

      it's been a long week with neither time, nor headspace for writing.  my trip home was stressful. my grandmother was in critical condition, the op on monday unsuccesful, and on wednesday, her right leg was amputated mid-thigh. the odds to survive that second operation were apparently 10:90 against survival, but she's pretty much ok right now, if weak,  tired and anemic. i returned down here on tuesday night nontheless, because it was just too taxing to be up there with the parents. when i arrived back here, one of the first things i did was cry for a good little while, because i was so exhausted from the trips to the hospital, supporting my mom (because my dad treated her like shit) and sad about the prospect of my grandma loosing her leg. monday and tueday, i  wished she would die before the op. she was extremely weak and non-communicative and it  seemed to me as if the docs wanted to operate her, just to put her to sleep, so to say. it seemed to me that it would be better if she didn't  have to go through the amputation and the realisation that the leg she has walked on for 93 years is gone now, but for now, she seems to be doing ok. the docs are surprised, and everyone else is. too. she woke up after the op with perfect blood pressure (120/70) - i don't  have that good blood pressure ever, really.   my grandma and i, we've talked on the phone pretty much every day. no great conversations or whatever, just brief little chats and she's lovely and sweet and telling me she's  "a little better"  compared to the day before when i ask her how she is, and i tell her that i love her, think about her and pray for her. she asked me for the latter the day of her op, and i went to the cathedral, lit a candle, and said the prayer's she wanted me to say for her, even though i never really pray this christian way anymore.  so yeah, it's been a strange week in that regard, really.  when the ice train came into the train station tuesday night, dirk waiting on the platform, it felt like much needed coming home. this city is home, for now, finally, and dirk is my home, too. he had the keys to my flat while i was away, had watched the telly there, slept there, and it was lovely to come home to my place and find it alive, lights on, late night dinner waiting to be cooked for me in the kitchen. it's great to come home to a person that you love.  the weeks has run by somehow, it's saturday already, and in a few hours my friend meals from sydney, currently living in konstanz, will arrive for the weekend. the last time i saw her was in melbourne, in september last year. it's strange how different life is now, compared to back then, how different i am, too. i told her on the phone i wasn't with evan anymore, and she hadn't heard about it yet, and that was strange, too. i hope we'll have a good, quiet time together, with lots of talking and hanging around. it's going to be a really hot weekend, and lounging on a lakeside will quite likely be as adventurous as it gets. speaking of evan... i finally got an email from him, after three weeks or so, and he tells me he, too, is seeing someone else, which i am happy about, and that he checked out my blog a few weeks ago, which i am not happy about. he never did that when we were together: why now, i wonder, why not earlier? how utterly ridiculous. i just don't get him, but then i don't think i need to get him anymore, so it's all fine and dandy. es ist wie es ist. or whatever.  i hope i will finally have time and headspace for real writing sometime next week. it's strange how time is rushing past, filled with love and hours in bed and sun and books and talks and people, and i don't chronicle what's happening. i want to remember what happened this summer, years from now, want to remember what i thought, what i did, what i read. is this grasping, wanting more than the now? quite likely. but i am so happy, so thankful for life, this summer, that i want to be able to look back at these days should sadder times ever return. yes, that is grasping. how silly. but i forgive myself. it's that love thing, which is simultaneously clouding my mind, and opening my eyes.

      today is the 55th birthday of germany's basic law, our constitution. i love our basic law; reading its first 20 articles is one of the few things that make me feel patriotic. reading it always makes me proud of the "fathers and mothers of the basic law", about their wanting to learn from the past, and build a better future for germany. it rocks. it's pure constitutional poetry.  today was also the 11th election of the bundespräsident, germany's head of state, an event held on the birthday of the basic law, every 5 years. i watched the procedure on the telly, as i've done before: it's always a good show, that election. the pre-reports that focus on all the famous folks invited into the bundesversammlung, info on the nominees, that sort of thing.  of course, the standard bundespräsidenten-wahl question was in order, too, same as everytime: why not let the people elect the president directly?  it was so funny really, to hear all those sportsmen and women (who the conservatives invited to come along and vote) asking these bizarre questions and telling the reporters they would like to see the präsident take up a more active role in everyday politics. it made me shudder. read the law, you morons, take a look back in history, and realize why.  fact is, the role of the bundespräsident was specifically crafted in the basic law as a mainly representative one, and the non-direct election of the präsident is an essential part of that. our präsident is supposed to be above day to day politics, to be non-partisan. he is supposed to give impulses to current politics, without being directly involved in them. an actual election campaign could taint that. fighting for voted could taint that. it would open the office to populism. - and quite simply put, we just haven't had too good experiences with directly elected heads of state round here. not that i think we germans would be on the verge of falling into a dictatorship again, if we let the people vote, but i just don't want  urlLink bild  to decide who will represent this country.  i know the whole representation thing makes the office of the bundespräsident sound pretty useless, but i've found all our presidents to have offered invaluable impulses and ideas to the country, its people and politics. some more, some less, obviously, but in my opinion its the transcendence of the job, that made it possible for them, to give those impulses.  theodor heuss, our first präsident, shaped the job he was the first to have. he showed that being without direct responsibilities (apart from signing laws and swearing in ministers and chancellors) didn't have to mean being un-important. he was a father figure to a whole generation, lovingly called "papa heuss". he visited every country that germany had occupied in the previous decades, as a dignified, open, interested man, presenting himself, and the country he represented, as intellectual people who did not ignore the past, but who were, at the same time, looking forward into the future. no german who has ever heard it can forget richard von weizsäckers speech on the 40th anniversary of the end of wwII; i even own it as a book. no one can disregard the important work roman herzog did in re-uniting germany. just our current president, johannes rau, was never to my personal liking, mainly because he was the head of my home state and because of his preacher-like rhetorics: many believe though, that he has served our country well these past 5 years. i don't really, but thankfully, his time is over in a few weeks anyway.  considering the bundespräsident is supposed to be above all party politics and be an identification figure for the people, and considering this has worked well these past 55 years, as all presidents have scored exceptionally high approval rates within a few weeks of their election, the election process itself has always been an awfully partisan affair, and this year was no exception. strangely enough though, both candidates ended up being both to my liking. for the first time, none of the usual suspects, long serving supreme court judges or politicians made the short list: both  urlLink horst köhler  and  urlLink gesine schwan  are professors.  i liked horst köhler right from the start, even though i hated the way he was selsected. i saw his first tv interview wth his wife, and his bio, manners, smile, internationalism and former position as head of the  urlLink international monetary fund  were very impressive. knowing about the make-up of the bundesversammlung, i had little doubt he'd be elected anyway. so why not someone who has spend the last few years on the outside, looking in? in a time were germany needs a lot of input, new directions, that's surely a good position to have been in.  gesine schwan seemed strange at first, but she grew on me. today to be exact. i watched my first thorough reports on her today, shortly before the voting started. i hadn't known that she had been thrown out of the spd for being to "middle of the road", hadn't known about her family actively opposing the nazis, about her ideas on society. i realised today, that there were more reasons to elect her than just her gender; some of the things she said were absolutey fabulous. where köhler used economics as arguments, she used sociology. i totally agree with her that blindly supporting a totally flexible society causes indifference, un-attachment and loss of societal bonds, and that that can not be a goal of society. i realised, as the votes were already counted in berlin, that she would have been a totally new kind of president, not just because of her gender, but because of her unbelievable drive, energy and smile, because of her complete un-attachement to current politics (that being something she shares with köhler) and even more so because of her focus on society, not politics. she frequently said that politics was more than economics, that is something i can only second.  however, as expected, köhler won the election, and will be our new bundespräsident. he won on as small a margin as possible, a little coup doubtlessly organised by rampant cdu electors, but i have no doubts that he will do a good job, even if i already see myself disagreeing with him; he mentioned somewhere, that we need a new discussion on abortion law. we surely don't. in general though, he seems like an interesting, well-educated man, who gained a lot of insight into global politics in his last job. in addition, his family seems fabulous, too.  he has got an interesting wife, they are parents to a son who was a teenage parent, and to a daughter who is severely disabled. i think that surely makes him someone who can speak first hand about a wide variety of issues.  it was great watching this today, seeing our democracy in action, both fantastic candidates being so thankful, so honored to have been nominated in the first place, for this highest office of our country; köhler being totally fluttered and happy and shy when the results came in, when history had been made.  but still. it would have been nice if it would have been a woman this time, a woman as qualified as gesine schwan. if even more history had been made today.   -----------------------------   more politics:   urlLink nytimes: susan sontag - "regarding the torture of others"   sontag makes a large number of excellent points in her fantastic essay on the power of pictures and words. it made me realise that fuck, the rhetorics of the bush administration have tainted my view of reality, too: what happened in abu ghreib was torture. not humiliation, abuse or mistreatment. as a lawyer to be, i should be more aware of my words. at least this language ain't mine, so i got an excuse: i've always accurately referred to it as "folter" during discussion in german, after all. sontag effectively and captivatingly puts into words what i have found myself unable to express about the torture by american soldiers as well.   "looking at these photographs, you ask yourself, how can someone grin at the sufferings and humiliation of another human being? set guard dogs at the genitals and legs of cowering naked prisoners? force shackled, hooded prisoners to masturbate or simulate oral sex with one another? and you feel naive for asking, since the answer is, self-evidently, people do these things to other people. rape and pain inflicted on the genitals are among the most common forms of torture. not just in nazi concentration camps and in abu ghraib when it was run by saddam hussein. americans, too, have done and do them when they are told, or made to feel, that those over whom they have absolute power deserve to be humiliated, tormented. they do them when they are led to believe that the people they are torturing belong to an inferior race or religion. for the meaning of these pictures is not just that these acts were performed, but that their perpetrators apparently had no sense that there was anything wrong in what the pictures show."  [...]  "shock and awe were what our military promised the iraqis. and shock and the awful are what these photographs announce to the world that the americans have delivered: a pattern of criminal behavior in open contempt of international humanitarian conventions. soldiers now pose, thumbs up, before the atrocities they commit, and send off the pictures to their buddies. secrets of private life that, formerly, you would have given nearly anything to conceal, you now clamor to be invited on a television show to reveal. what is illustrated by these photographs is as much the culture of shamelessness as the reigning admiration for unapologetic brutality."  [...]  (on attempts of the administration to prevent the release of more torture pictures) "but the real push to limit the accessibility of the photographs will come from the continuing effort to protect the administration and cover up our misrule in iraq -- to identify 'outrage' over the photographs with a campaign to undermine american military might and the purposes it currently serves. just as it was regarded by many as an implicit criticism of the war to show on television photographs of american soldiers who have been killed in the course of the invasion and occupation of iraq, it will increasingly be thought unpatriotic to disseminate the new photographs and further tarnish the image of america.   after all, we're at war. endless war. and war is hell, more so than any of the people who got us into this rotten war seem to have expected. in our digital hall of mirrors, the pictures aren't going to go away. yes, it seems that one picture is worth a thousand words. and even if our leaders choose not to look at them, there will be thousands more snapshots and videos. unstoppable."   one of the best things, if not the best thing, i have read so far on this.  speaking of pictures of american soldiers who have been killed, i came across   urlLink the washington post: faces of the fallen - us fatalities in iraq  today. shocking. totally shocking. now imagine a similar database with all the iraqi victims. yeah. that would be the start of a revolution against bush. or at least i hope it would be.  also at the washingtonpost:  urlLink in iraq, the job opportunity of a lifetime - managing a $13 billion budget with no experience . young us conservatives, fresh from grad school, have made decisions in iraq they were totally not capable of doing. scary shit.  urlLink aaron  posted that the article reminded him  "why enthusiastic young white conservatives shouldn't be allowed to leave the us without adult supervision, let alone being put in charge of rebuilding a country" . right on.  and lastly:  urlLink i am happy for michael moore . in a war like his, a war against stupidity, all weapons are allowed.

      i am feeling a tiny little bit better, healthwise, at least compared to yesterday. yesterday was awful; i felt progressively worse during the day and got pretty scared when i couldn't speak at all by nighttime. it happened as i was calling dirk, i just couldn't get words out, all i could do was cough and hoarsely whisper. dirk didn't even recognize my voice. duh. can't blame him. so today is better, and that's good. slept a little bit better (albeit not much), can speak a little, can think a little, the headache and facial pain are bearable, the muscle and joint pain, too.  depending on how i'll feel tomorrow, i might still go to the docs in the morning, just to check. the self-diagnosis is that of a simple common cold that has turned into sinusitis and laryngitis;  the latter could be to blame for that muscle and joint pain, i guess. it's awful, and i never really had that before. so yeah. i still look like shit, too, swollen face and neck and huge bags under my eyes. there's a lecture i should go to at 2pm tomorrow, i'll see whether i can manage: considering the short 10 minute walk to the bakery this morning left me needing a nap afterwards, i am not so sure. i'll see how it goes.  i just hate being sick. i hate it so much, and the last few months have had so much sickness and so many disease scares, i've had enough for a few years.  in late november, after a few weeks of very intense work, i had sudden hearing loss in my left ear. it happened after a week that consisted of an exam, a 3 day ip seminar where i held a presentation (and hardly slept, because of socialising, preparation for that presentation and attending a 5am morning vesper mass) and a day of 15 hours of market research work at a noisy, busy airport. that same day, my grandma died, news that weren't surprising, but pretty bad nonetheless. when i arrived back home that night, i was totally wiped out, cried for a while, while dirk tried to comfort me, and feel into bed. i woke up at about 3am, with an awful, awful noise in my ear, that wouldn't go away. i felt like i was under water, one side of me at least. no matter how many times i tried to "un-pop" my ear, it just wouldn't change at all. the noise in my head totally stressed me out, i started to get totally irrational and scared. the noise and the balance problems were  totally frightening. unfortunately, i didn't know that those psychological symptoms are part of sudden hearing loss. - i might have been able to relax a little, if i had know. i went to the er early that morning, where they couldn't do much but tell me to go to the ent later that day, which i did. hearing tests showed massive hearing loss. i also had tinnitus in that ear. with swift treatment (basically blood-thinning meds) and silence and relaxing and sleeping, my hearing returned over the course of a few days. the  urlLink ">tinnitus  stayed though; even though it has gotten a lot better in recent weeks. just now, with this cold, it has made a return.  it was an awful experience. it didn't help, that the cause of that kind of hearing loss is not quite understood: some think it's a circulation issue; others reckon an electrolyte balance inside the ear is to blame, in some cases it's noise. the main belief is, that it's caused by stress and personality structure. obsessive-compulsives are quite prone to it. uhm, yeah, stress. obesessiveness. yeah. interestingly enough, phil collins had sudden hearing loss, too, and still has tinnitus as well.  another possible cause for sudden hearing loss is  urlLink acoustic neuroma , a tumor on the hearing nerve. it's pretty rare, but apparently pretty frequent in cases of hearing loss at my age. yeah, a brain tumor. that kinda scared me. a whole lot, actually. after several hours worth of tests, that was ruled out though. quite a relief.  after that whole hearing loss drama, i had a massive bout of flu that knocked me out over christmas. then came an intense allergic reaction, and tests showed that i am allergic to a wide variety of metals, sheep wool (!), molds of various kinds, foods (including sea food, milk etc.) and a whole lot more. yeah. after that, after changing my bcp prescription, i had awful full-body-itching, which i though to be a side effect, while my gyno thought it to be the onset of  urlLink acute intermittent porphyria , a chronic liver disease. yeah. more scary shit. a gastroenterologist sorted me out though, and my liver is fine. then, in march, the good old tension headache made a dramatic little return. muscle relexants and a few low doses of elavil did the trick though, and i talked my doc into giving me a prescription for 6 session with a physiotherapist, and those have helped tremendously. still have 3 to go, and they are such fun. it seems that my first vertebrae is to blame, so the physio (young, pretty and muscular) searches out the muscles supporting my head, presses certain spots for a while (which hurts, hurts, hurts), but afterwards, i feel better. pretty amazing. evan's new partner is a physiotherapist, too; i can understand how he chose an apparently less intellectually interesting (his words, not mine) relationship with someone with those manual skills over an ldr with me. surely nice to have someone with those skills nearby at all times. i'd like that, too. he.  so yeah, in general, i think my body has been telling me, in pretty dramatic ways, that something simply isn't right  in my life and that i need to change something. like my obsessiveness, my stress levels, the way i approach life. so hard to make those changes though.  if i get so run down with the little things i have to deal with in my life, how am i supposed to handle a full-time job/kids/the real world? kinda scary. the doc told me, after the hearing loss, that if i didn't change life now, i'd quite likely keep having trouble for the rest of my life. he compared the hearing loss to the ulcers other people get when stressed, or the ibs, or whatever else.  i know working out helps with my stress, but i get so stressed out about doing the "perfect" amount of exercise, that it stresses me, too. i know yoga helps me with stress, but the whole cult-drama surrounding ralf has turned me off his classes, totally. yoga practice by myself is good too, but i get upset if i don't do it "perfectly", i.e. get up before 6am each and every morning to do a full sivananda session before uni, including pranayama and meditation. i know this isn't a sane or healthy or yogic approach at all. i should take it as it comes, and be glad with it, but i can't. same with eating and stayin hydrated. good eating helps me stay energised, but during the week, i find it hard to find the energy to cook good meals, even though it's important to plan those a little as a new vegan. i've gained some weight with the bcp change, too, which has made me all obsessed with weight again. it's like a vicious circle.  i know i should tackle it all one little baby step at a time, but it seems overwhelming to get my health and life into a bit of an order. i should probably simply quit wanting to do everything perfectly. easier said than done. gah.  at least i've had a healthy meal today. and yesterday, too. all almost completely vegan as well (apart from some milk in the frozen spinach i used for my pasta). that's something. and i resisted the  urlLink aspirin & pseudoephedrine  so far. little miracle symptom masker that it is, i really didn't feel like feeling all high today (pseudoephedrine does that to me, i'm super sensitive to it), just to totally crash tomorrow, when it's time for uni again, and when a whole week of work, and a weekend of work and travel is ahead of me. and i slept okay. and i got some fresh air. and i marvelled at the plants on my balcony. and i relaxed, watching  urlLink crossroads , and loving it, all its inconsistencies and shallowness included.  overall, considering the sick-ness, i guess it was as good as it could be, alone at home and all. good on me. can't wait for the man to come home though: life is simply better when he is around. a lot better. how good i still have three more days to regain health and beauty before he returns. &nbsp;

      ...love royal weddings. always have, quite likely always will.  i got hooked as a little girl, when i watched royal weddings with my grandma, starting with that of fergie and andrew. my grandma loved reading about europes royals, especially the english ones, in cheapo yellow press mags with badly re-touched photos on their covers; proclaiming new drama, every week. in recent years, i realised i also like royal funeral and christenings, anything royal, really, as long as its on the telly with bad experts talking about nothing for hours. hmmmm: royals! give me that charming young prince william, anytime!  so i spend this morning just the way i spend  urlLink last friday afternoon , watching yet another  urlLink royal wedding , and oh, was it lovely.  i ohhd and ahhd at everything and sniffled, a little (not as much as last week, when frederik cried... if you haven't seen anything, or heard his speech to his bride,  urlLink read this  and weep!) and not just because of this awful flu that is severly hampering my abilities to do pretty much anything.  this was a full on royal wedding: pretty bride & attractive groom;  urlLink full on conservative but stylish deeply v-necked wedding dress ; plenty of strangely dressed guests; a little drama (oh, the rain!); pretty hats and dresses and flowers; kisses; classic wedding music; a big fat catholic service (the catholic girl in me needs that kind of service in a wedding) and  urlLink 1 corinthians 13:1-13 . awwwww.  i like weddings, handfastings, love-proclamations, committment of any kind: i love them all. they don't have to be royal, but royal is always good, because of the grandeur and ultimate fairy-tale material on show.  in general, though, i think the main cause for my fascination with weddings is not just my XX chromosomes, it's seeing people, no matter of what gender or age, being so in love, so trusting in what they feel, that they want to tell the world about it in a public manner. it rocks. seeing the massachussetts weddings last week got me teary eyed in front of the telly as well: my love of weddings doesn't solely stem from white dresses, big parties or catholic rituals or anything. - even though all that is surely nice. it's the love behind it. britney spears 5 minute marriage left me stonecold. carmen electra and dave navarros nuptials didn't.  on my way to the supermarket this morning, i passed by two wedding parties in front of the mayors office, and they got me all happy, too. maybe it's just that happiness that i like, who knows.  when i was with evan, i was dead-set on marrying him. i fantasized about where in melbourne we would get married, what it would be like. i looked at dresses on websites. i thought about who would dj, what the first song would be. - in short: i turned into the kind of woman i never wanted to be. i wanted a wedding like the other aussie-german couple we knew. my mistake was a common one: i thought much about  *marrying*  evan, not about  *being married*  to him. the first might have been fun: big parties are always good. the latter would have been a total desaster, probably sooner rather than later, for a multitute of reasons. i wanted marriage to make that surrealist, faulty relationship that we had to last. i am happy that dream never came true.  these days, on a personal level, that wedding thing is a total non-issue for me. i actually have a hard time understanding that i really wanted this all, a little more than a year ago, and seriously thought that sooner would be better than later. . that doesn't mean i never want to get married: i surely want to have a life partner, someone to live life with, to love, to have children with, the whole deal, with a big party and committment, too. however, it just doesn't seem urgent at all. - i'm not ready for any of that right now, and that's fine and dandy for me. that doesn't mean that i don't see what dirk and i have as the real deal, as something that won't last. it's quite the opposite. i enjoy our love so much in this present moment that excessively pondering the future just isn't an issue. - i don't know where the roads will take us this year, and why should i stress about it, when it's all good as it is? why should i push something on him neither of us wants or is ready for (yet)? a true partnership takes time to grow, and what has grown between us this past year is better than anything i ever experienced, ever. i am curious what will come, one moment at a time.  like the buddha said:  "love in the past is only a memory. love in the future is only a fantasy. true love lives in the here and now."   yeah.

      it's always nice to realise a belief or opinion you've held about something is totally spot on. it's awful-awful-awful though, when those beliefs and opinions are &middot that the us justice system is faulty, corrupt, discriminating, ineffective and open for witch hunts and revenge; &middot that us prisons are hellish; and &middot that that the death penalty is no verdict any just society would ever inflict unto its citizens. i thought i was already completely disillusioned about the us legal system, but apparently, i wasn't totally disillusioned. at least not until this morning. i guess i have reached an even deeper level of disillusionment today.  this morning i came across a  urlLink  current post  at  urlLink margaret cho's blog , a post that featured excerpts from a letter by damien echols, describing his life on arkansas death row.   "who's damien echols?" , i wondered. margaret offered just a short introductory note, but provided a link. i had seen a  urlLink wm3.org  banner before, at another blog i frequent, but had never actually checked it out. after reading damiens letter, i did though, and it totally shook me up.  in may 1993, the mutilated bodies of 3 eight year old boys, james moore, steven branch and christopher byers, were found in a drainage creek near west memphis, arkansas. within a day, local police were questioning local teenager daniel echols. he was the odd one out in west memphis; long-haired, wiccan, with a faible for metal music. a few weeks after the discovery of the bodies, another teenager, jessie misskelley (who hardly knew damien) "confessed" to police that damien had killed the boys with his friend jason baldwin, and also implicated himself. in february of 1994, jessie was found guilty on three counts of capital murder and sentended to life in prison without parole. 2 months later, damien and jason were found guilty as well. jason received a sentence of life in prison plus 40 years. damien, who was believed to have been the head of a "satanic cult" during whose rituals the boys had been murdered, was sentenced to death by lethal injection.  knowing just these little tidbits, one might think that this is the perfect example of the us legal system working. people who commited a horrible crime being convicted and sentenced accordingly. the problem however, is that there was no solid evidence at all that damien, jessie and jason were involved in the murder of the three young boys. let me repeat: no. evidence. at. all.  there were however, a town full of people who fell into "satanic panic"; a police department unable to deal with a triple homicide who did not follow essential clues and let people trample down the crime scene; a medical examiner who did extremely sloppy work (with my cursory medical knowledge and a bunch of csi episodes on my back, i could easily spot a whole bunch of weak points in his autopsy report); police officers not informing a suspect about his rights and coercing said teenager (who, by the way, has a below average iq) to make a false confession; a community so shocked by the gruesome murder, that they preferred to quickly blame it on someone who seemed odd, instead of looking for the real killer among themselves; a judge who chose not to include essential defense evidence and let the da present bogus scientific evidence; and a real suspect, the aggressive stepfather of one of the victims with good connections to the police department.  overall, it's a story so unbelievable, that if it were in a book or movie, i wouldn't believe it. i just wouldn't buy that in this present day and age, people who should know better, who should hold themselves to extremely high standards of professional conduct, police men, judges, district attorneys, would act this way. close their eyes to the truth. use music lyrics, religious beliefs and style of clothing as evidence of criminal intent. disregard the absence of any physical evidence. "loose", spoil or just not collect essential evidence. but in the case of damien, jessie and jason, they did all this. and more. a whole lot more.  it's all so fucking OBVIOUS, it's unbelievable that those policemen never doubted that the three teenagers weren't the one's who really committed those murders. the chief investigator claimed on a scale of 1 to 10, he was so sure those three did it. he'd choose an 11. i wonder whether that man can sleep at night. if those men all never doubted their opionions, a few episodes of csi, a few crime books surely have taught me more than any training west memphis police and their medical examiner have enjoyed in forensic taught them. so much of what happened there is forensic knowledge every tv watching layperson has. excessive stabbings (in rage) and genital mutilations often being signs of an emotional connection between offender and victim for example. or basic how-tos of not spoiling a crime scene, such as not moving the victims and not letting other people get there. or taping confessions in their entierety. or informing suspects of their rights. i could go on, and on, and on.  damien has been on death row for eleven years now. in his letter to margaret cho he describes his day; some "highlights" include being woken up at 4am for breakfast; meals consisting of spoiled meat and vegetables with crickets and other assorted insects; rats in his cell all over him at night; no real human contact apart from a brief phone call in the morning with his wife. i am amazed how reflected, articulate and well-spoken damien is, how hard he tries to keep up a routine, to keep his head together, meditate and not let the situation get total control over him. i can't imagine a situation where you have even less control of your life than on death row, but damien seems to hold up amazingly well. margaret added that she edited the letter to spare damien trouble, and i can only assume that she's left out things that are so bad i don't even want imagine them. there have been a few articles in the papers round here lately about that jail warden, you know, that man who's so prominently featured in the abuse pictures from abu ghreib; stories about him abusing inmates in us prisons, long before. i have no doubt at all, that those stories are true. i hence have little doubt, what the situation on arkansas death row must be like; abuse wise, i mean.  i whine about my life; not too often anymore, considering how happy i've been this past year, how much better i feel about myself and life and everything else, but i still do, occasionally. way too often. how can i? this wonderful, free life full of options and choices and possibilities and love and sunshine and blue skies and smelling the flowers and being with the man i love and touching him whenever i want. i have no reason to whine, really, no reason at all. i am healthy and whole and surrounded by goodness; my "problems" are minor and temporary. damien is on death row in an unjust country for a crime someone else committed (someone who might have committed another murder; someone who is still free), having been robbed of his options, of life with a wife who has never known him in freedom and the kid he fathered as a teenager before this all occured (and that was born while he was already in prison), of fresh air and the nightly sky and decisions about his life and everything, just everything. all just because he was a teenager not much different than i was like. not much different from what many teenagers are like. a bit of an eccentric, an outcast with a strange style in clothes, an interest in religious beliefs and a liking for music with heavy guitars.  fucking unbelievable.  sure, being a priviledged person in western europe, i could compare myself to many million people on this world and regard my life as better, but somehow, even though i am not american, damiens story hits close to home, my home; probably i guess, because what happened to him, the fear and ignorance and injustice he and the other two were confronted with *are* universal. another lesson, i guess, to value what you have, and to treasure life and the present moment. because all you ever have, thank you once again,  urlLink eckhart tolle , is the present moment anyway.  i feel strangely compelled to write damien a letter of support now, not that i feel that anything i can say might be insightful. they say on the website that all three appreciate everyday mail, no in-depth discussions of the trial, of wicca or whatever, just regular, nice letters. could i write those without feeling guilty of the goodness in my life? maybe i'll send bookd from their amazon wishlists instead. or a few dollars to the legal defense fund.  how can the us claim to have the right and duty to spread freedom and justice in other countries (with bombs, tanks and soldiers and all), when freedom and justice don't even exist in the us?  once more i am glad to be european.   more:   urlLink wm3.org   urlLink courttv: "the west memphis three: did satanists murder 3 boys?"   urlLink wm3.org: synopsis of the case by burk sauls

       urlLink    i stopped wearing shirts with captions a few years ago, after realising that my "sex bomb" t-shirt was just a little too attention-grabbing, to be exact. i remember a particular incident at  "marias"  with mic, back when we were kinda hooking up but not quite hooking up, when his eyes were transfixed on the sparkly letters on my chest the entire night, actually telling me that he, too, thought i was a sex bomb. he. i'm not one for abundant statements.  i gladly make an exception from the "no-caption rule" for my new "bored of the beckhams" t-shirt though. not that this isn't an abundant statement, but it's an accurate description on this almost brazillian-style-yellow-press-yellow-shirt.  the brother, still residing in london, send it over the channel, after we had talked about the beckhams during one of our email conversations. how could one not love to wear this shirt after the recent scandals being all over the tabloids, the boulevard tv shows and back? i am sooo bored by the hooopla around them, the haircuts, the nail polishes, the matching clothes, the affairs, the mis-spelled tattoos. enough of this car-crash watching. - it's getting boring.  added plus: the yellow is uplifting. i'll definitely wear it out to watching the euro 2004 games in biergartens all over freiburg this summer. yay to that. and yay to hello for this picture posting thing. highly cool. &nbsp; urlLink

      i love living downtown, i really do. 30 seconds to uni, 45 seconds to the farmers market at the cathedral, 15 seconds, a simple walk down the stairs, to about 5 bars and 2 clubs. that last thing can be cool some days, and totally totally mindblowingly uncool and awful other days.  like early this morning.  my poor sick body was resting in bed, asleep while the balcony door was wide open (cool air feels good in stuffy nose and all), when a drunken  urlLink soul & house singer  left through the backdoor of the downstairs  wannabe-hip-club-for-meterosexual-freiburgers  at 4:30 a.m. with the owners of hence club, screaming and singing at the top of her doubtlessly very wide range, very capable lungs, apparently alternating between making out with both owners (how one can physically make out/scream/sing almost simultaneously, i am not sure, but this woman surely could!), screaming  "this will end in fucking tears, boys, this will end in tears."  no screaming back of my sick self even made it to that mad trio, that's how loud she was/they were, how out of it, sick and incapable of screaming i was/and am.  fuck em. i've been awake ever since, watching nighttime trash tv, feeling like shit. it's a public holiday today: i could have slept in. once i am awake, i have a really hard time getting back to sleep, especially when sick, especially when dirk is not around to cuddle with. and today is going to be hot, so sleeping during the day might not offer as much relief as a nighttime snooze with cool air.  fuck em.

      enough of this hiatus. here i go again, with a sparkly new blogger given layout, no less. hmm, that new blogger design and those templates are yummy. so shiny and new.  nothing quite like getting back into that old blogging groove when you wake up with a sore throat and head cold on an 28°C may day, a day that should be spent studying the finer details of property for that killer recap class with that world renowned property prof (who quite likely is the one man who actually understands each and every nook and cranny of german property law) and monopolies law for that equally killer recap/exam prep class with the man who is doubtlessly germany's top cartel/ip judge. oh yeah.  sounds like the most perfect day for getting back to blogging after a 9 month absense. 9 months! geez. i could have given birth in that time. alas, i didn't. where did those 9 months go? what did i do? strange not to have anything written from those months, they were good, and full, and full of change, too.  quality posts, soonish. now: more tinkering with more blogs i own; more aspirine and the first real food of the day.  so weird/good to write here again. is it time for this again? i'll see.

      when i arrived back home late last night, i got to unpack the birthday present my brother send me from london. it's a  urlLink pink t-shirt from fcuk  that lists  "love/sing/sleep/dream/eat/fcuk/laugh"  in bold arial down the front. it's lovely. i know that "fcuk"/"fuck" thing is getting kinda boring in the uk, but this ain't the uk, so why care? i like it.  apart from the "fuck" thing, i think did everything listed on the shirt, these past few days. and more. a whole lot more.  it's been a while since i had days that were as packed as these without being stressed out. it was a good seminar, this one. exceptional, actually, and my ultra-brief stay in munich with dirk's friend martin was highly enjoyable, too.  i left the city late saturday morning, packed into a tiny corsa with 4 other people heading to the seminar and lots and lots of luggage: not the kind of roadtripping i like. as if that wasn't enough, the other 4 seemed to have only one topic of interest: preparing for law finals. those fuckers. put more than 3 law students in one place, and within less than 10 minutes they will discuss finals, review classes or not, exams ad nauseam. i slept instead of partaking in this boring exercise. the driver, the aforementioned girl i would have preferred to avoid, almost killed us twice, alas, with no success. after 6 hours of being squeezed into the corsa and a brief stop at germany's only  urlLink feng shui resthouse , i was dropped off at martin's place in downtown munich. martin and i, we wasted no time and immediately took off to a party that ended up incorporating 3 locations (a lakeside/garden bbq/rented bar) and lasting 9 hours. a grande celebration, indeed. it was the combined birthday/graduation party of one of martins snowboard teacher friends, and yeah, it was an experience, not just because i (obviously) didn't know anyone but martin. it was a surreal/twilight zone type of experience at times: everyone was good looking.  the group of friends that was partying that night (close to 100 people or so) looked like out of a clothing shoot for  urlLink neon  or something. everyone was *hip* in that pretentious but effortless-looking  "i don't care about clothes at all, i'm just coming back from the beach/the slope/something equally cool"  leisurely, sporty easy-going surfer-style. i know it's just as fake, just as planned as any other style people and cliques choose, but it still had quite some appeal. much more appeal than all those law people wearing burberry, trying to be all upper class at least. i don't know whether all the non-perfect people the birthday girl knew were not invited, but i don't think i have ever seen that many really good looking people in one place. it was odd, but fun.  one bloke in particular, a snowboard-teacher/physiotherapist (how come i like physiotherapists all of the sudden?)/student called harry was especially exceptional. at location #1 (the lake), he was jumping around in bathing shorts that could not have hung an inch lower without exposing his dick, and good grace, this man had THE BODY. i think i've never seen that kind of body in real life before: it was perfect. absolutely perfect. perfectly rounded. perfectly muscly (no bodybuilder-ugliness). perfectly firm. perfectly proportioned. perfectly six-packed. perfectly hip-boned. perfectly veiny stomach. breathtaking, that body. harry very obviously knew about his bodies' perfectness and showed it. jumping around, shaking his bum. doing sports. shaking his head just *so*. he had this physical-ness and ease about himself that made me all envious and goose-bumpy and getting a girly hard-on. on top of that, he had the arrogance to go with his perfectness. what fun. he kept making playfully arrogant sidestatements to me, and i kept kicking back. didn't have my usual level of verbal skills available though: i simply could not stop admiring this perfectly bodied arrogant prick. it was estrogen at work, i'd say, or maybe it my genes that were telling me to procreate with that body to give my children a better chance at life. how good that i have my estrogen and my genes under control and don't listen to them. at least most of the time. at the end of the night, just as martin and i were leaving the party, i actually told harry that he had the most beautiful ass i had laid my eyes on in the last year. yes, this was a sexist statement, i know, but i had to say *something* to acknowledge that he had won (and won me over). and well, he appreciated the comment, and seemed pleased. i bet he had heard that before. and more than just once.  so yes, it was fun that party, for more reasons than the visual appeal.  being out of my comfort zone is good for me, most of the time, and it surely was good this time: i got to sit and wait and observe and realise that all the cool people where not that cool after all, because they were unable to approach and make smalltalk with me. when i had enough of that, i chatted up some new people and enjoyed myself. strange how i forget during my reclusive times how much i actually enjoy interaction with others and that i am actually good at it, too. in the course of the night, i teamed up with peter, who was a guest who knew almost no one else as well, and we chatted about the usual things people who meet like we did talk about: football, women, men and sex. those are the eternal issues, aren't they? apart from that, there was some decent drinking, watching the football, being sad because freddie won't be shooting any more goals this euro and dancing to ragga (is that what it's called?).  at 2:30am, martin and i cruised home in his grande old mercedes. it was a string of perfect moments, that cruising home to downtown munich, listening to air and coldplay and talking about personal matters. strangely enough, those perfect moments reminded me of driving home through melbourne with evan. munich isn't melbourne, martin ain't my boyfriend, and that mercedes was surely more comfy than the mg, and i have never talked that openly with evan about what about that long distance relationship did, what i let it do, to my mental health right after that conversation, i had one of those brief moment of being scared about being so wide-open and honest and talking so much, as i often do when i finally talk to people without the usual joking and punlines and cynicism, but i told martin about that feeling, too, and that moment passed, and it was all fine. we slept in on sunday, had breakfast and then our time together was over and i headed out to catch my ride south to the chiemsee at noon. - didn't get to see much of munich, really. - it was a fantastic "first" impression nonetheless. i loved the vibe of the city, the look, the feel. i could live there, i think, and live there well. i would love to live there, i think, not that i'd know how to afford it, but there's plenty of ip to be done there, so it's something i will surely keep in mind.  the one hour journey down to the chiemsee, this time with just three people in the tiny corsa, was uneventful: i sat in the back preparing the case i had to present, avoiding any further discussions on law finals. arriving in gstadt at the ferry, i could finally escpae the eternal law final discussions of the corsa crew, as a couple of fellow seminar people and our lecturer max were already waiting for the next ferry, eating ice cream and enjoying the glorious weather. last time i was there, in november, it was all quiet and serene, bright blue skies and sunshine and the alps in the distance, no one on the ferry but us. this time we had the same bright blue skies and the alps were still there of course and there was sunshine, too, but it was also more than 25°C degrees, there was lots of lush green and flower displays on the island and there were also throngs of tourists on the ferry with us. it was cliche germany, cliche bavaria at its best. the only thing missing was some bavarian music, or maybe some wagner.  one of the people waiting with max for the ferry was christopher, max's only "leftover" doctorate students from munich. at first sight, he totally reminded me of my friend timm, who i met through the student exchange program. it would turn out that that was an accurate first impression: christopher is quite similar to timm in some ways, not just looks-wise, but personality wise as well. it was eerie in a way, as it made me miss timm who i lost touch with over the past years, and because i sometimes thought the person who was there was timm, not someone else altogether. i actually had to apologise to christopher at one point during the seminar, because i was just mixing him up with timm in my head and once i quit that, it was much better. no need to mix someone up with a long missed friend, when that person is fantastic already. while definitely not timm, christopher turned out to be much more than good looking and funny: he's extremely smart, spontaneous and fun to be around. - anything but your average law student. no discussions on law finals were had in his presence. we kinda clicked in some ways, and ended up spending a lot of our time together during the seminar. i wish max imported him to freiburg. - i don't think there's a man like him to be found at freiburg uni's law faculty. i wish there was. or maybe not, because crushing on him would be kinda taxing in the long run, ogling him in the library and not getting any work done. he. :) it was fun while it lasted though. i could do with need someone like him around.  so what did we do all these days? law wise, there was lots of work. max gave some brief overviews on important cartel and competition issues and we ended up discussing specific competition issues relating to unfair advertising in great detail and with great enthusiam. lots of time was spend doing case work and hearing lectures by participants. i would have liked some more detailed discussion there, but time was limited, so we rushed through some parts. my little case presentation went well, especially considering how little time i spend preparing it. overall, i learned a fair bit these past few days, realising that competition and cartel law is the other law subject besides ip that i enjoy. i guess i can love law on more days than just thursdays.  life wise, it was a mini holiday, really. football was watched on sunday night. christopher, jens and i sat on a landing stage late sunday evening drinking beer, as lightning flashed over the kampenwand, thunder rolling in, rain falling down on us. only as lightning was coming closer and as the rain got heacer and heavier did we sprint back to the convent, huddling under the gate to the courtyard. during our lunch breaks, various groups would trot over the island, admiring the gardens in full bloom and the little ducklings and swans and being envied by tourists when they realised that we were allowed to go inside the convent. mealtime was always good, too, excellent chats and good food (vegetarian but very much non-vegan. they had a list and i marked myself as both vegetarian and non fish, so when they served fish for everyone, i got meat. it caused much confusion because in bavaria, vegetarians apparently all eat fish. duh.). the evenings were long, and there was little sleep. late monday night, as the entire group including max sat on that landing stage, getting drunk, there was a technicolor, miami vice style pink sunset to be observed, and funny conversations to be had. yet another string of perfect moments. long after midnight the hardcore few of the seminar (nadia and i being the only girls) went skinny dipping on the northside of the island. the water was nowhere near as cold as expected, and it was just lovely to swim under the starry sky in the silence of the lake, later sitting on another landing stage, talking for a few more hours. i went to morning laudes on tuesday morning, at 5:30am, which was, like last time, quite a spiritual experience. it was the only chance to again observe the lives of the nuns living in the convent. it's a life so very much different to any life i will ever live, so different to any life i'd ever want to liver, but with an appeal that i can relate to. right after mass, i went swimming with christopher one last time to start the day (not quite skinny dipping this time), and that was yet another perfect moment. it was still totally quiet, the sun was coming up through some light clouds, there was mist hanging over the alps and a lone fisherman was out fishing. the water was cold and nice and refreshing and i felt alive and happy and well. why i never liked swimming naked or topless until last year, i don't remember. - it feels so much better.  so yeah, overall, i had a great few days: intense, on many levels, and it wasn't just the competition law.  it was strange to face that girl that totally triggered me on so many levels, but i dealt with it, catching that ride and even sharing a room with her. it was alright, not just because i realised that she has flaws, too. i felt pretty good about being me these days, so why try to be someone else? good question, isn't it? i spend good time with people old and new, not just christopher, but nadia, too, who i will be hanging out with later today to watch the football. it was fun that till and reinhard were there as well, and there were more folks who were enjoyable who i will be seeing at uni. who knows, these 3 days might be the basis for a friendship or at least some coffee company for uni. - whatever will be, will be good; i'll feel less lonely in the crowds. there were some good conversations all around during meals, and it was good to once again interact with law people again, making me realise once again that there are some good people among the psychos.  when it was time to leave yesterday after lunch, i would have loved to stay longer, even if it had meant more work. despite the workload, it felt like the holiday i needed so much.  i got to catch a ride home with reinhard and till (no final exam preparation talks this time), and we road-tripped through bavaria, extending that little holiday of ours. we looked at one of king ludwigs castles ( urlLink schloss linderhof )and its venus grotto (the place where he listened to wagner, all alone), having an awful, rushed guided tour there that was designed for the attention span of a  "see-europe-in-5-days"  american audience. it was overall ok nonetheless, because no matter how awful that castle with its kitschy grotto was, the landscape was grande. and it's "location. location.  location." right? i'm even more sure now than after seeing herrenchiemsee, that ludwig was not a mentally healthy person. listening to wagner in a fake grotto dedicated to venus? pardon me.  we hopped over the border to austria to get petrol, speeding with till's tiny nissan micra over curvy roads along glacier lakes and back into germany through tiny villages that looked just like people from overseas think germany looks like. neuschwanstein was the distance, which we will visit in november, when max heads out to the convent again for a true ip seminar. we drove home via lake constance and it was past 11 when i got home. walking towards my flat, from martin's gate, i got a serious case of culture shock from all the people still sitting outside and being on the street. - it wasn't that i hadn't seen that many people during those past days, there were the tourists, after all, i think it was the change from country to city. where are the mountains? where is the lake? it didn't help that i was totally zonked out and tired and unable to communicate at all. - dirk was quite upset at me being so out of it. when i'm tired, i apparently appear angry, even though i'm not, and he still can't recognise it. all is fine again today. - i spend the morning at uni listening to max holding the lecture in front of the commission that might give him the job to head the chair for commercial law. now there's organisational stuff to be done, boring things like clean the flat, and a lecture at 4pm that i am not motivated to go to. but i will. go me.  so what did i do these past few days?  love/sing/sleep/dream/eat/ fcuk / laugh/drink/admire/pray/adore/crush on/ swim/learn/study/enjoy/relax/talk/ listen/road-trip/be-friend and more.  i'm happy, yes. very much so.

      more and more issues regarding the law seminar weekend ahead are being resolved, and that's quite a relief. i hate last minute planning. got my ride. got my place to stay in munich for tomorrow night. got the laundry happening, will pack later today. just haven't prepared my case yet, or managed much of the 150 or so pages i should still work through in advance.  it should all be fine on time. as fine as 3 days  urlLink in a convent on a tiny bavarian island  in the company of law people working 10 hours a day on competition and cartel law can be. i was scared about being bored and lonely last time, and it all turned out fine: got no reason to believe it should be different this time. will be good to socialise with law folks, don't do that enough. will be good to work through my social anxiety, too. because of course the person i least wanted to carpool with because she makes me feel inferior, the one who started law school with me and did it all perfectly, now doing her phd, is giving me the ride. i'll be learning a few lessons this weekend, and they won't be about cartels or competition at all.  it'll be intense, i know that already. but i love the place: the island is great, the weather is supposed to be good (am even taking along a bikini), the convent has a calm atmosphere and i will definitely take part in a morning mass again. i might even take along my yoga mat to practise outside before breakfast.  it'll be a mini holiday with a maximum of work. all i need to do is to make sure i don't get as stressed out and sleep-deprived as last time, when i got myself hearing loss as a result.  so yeah: this is it, till wednesday. i'm off to work.

      ha! how good does it feel to be tracked down every once in a while?  it feels fantastic.  yesterday, my first ever "boyfriend" karsten left a message on my parents answering machine to ask for my phone number to be able to wish me a happy belated birthday.  how cool is that?  i haven't seen karsten in 5 years. i thought about calling him this spring, when i was bored and lonely in hometown for a week, but didn't, because of the usual past boyfriend reasons. it's been 13 years since we hung out together, two kids in love, smooching at the movies during "pretty woman" and going on canoe tours with the club we both belonged to. it was all totally non-tragic and good and cool and harmless and healthy. life just took some odd turns, so even though we've been in touch on and off all these years (always knowing where the parents lived), somehow we never managed to sustain contact. he's a breathtakingly beautiful man and i'm already excited about hearing how he is, how his life is, he's listed alone in the phone book, looks like he's not with the girlfriend anymore that he lived with when we last met. i'll be in hometown i august, i should propose a meeting. hmmm.  evan, for the record, has not been in touch. what does it mean that a 6 month boyfriend from 13 years ago calls, yet the 4 years boyfriend from 1 year ago does not? hmmmm.  i just care a little. but i do. and to admit that is odd.

      oh yes, thursdays, i love law.  this afternoon's ip session had a slow start, but the last 30 minutes were a-w-e-s-o-m-e. we discussed copyright issues of deep-linking. and boy, is it fun to discuss internet matter with people who have no idea whatsoever how the internet/a browser/html/rss/anything works. it was lovely. i could not avoid explaining a classmate the finer details of linking. i got a bit snarky, maybe, but it was fun. a lot of fun. the opinions he expressed would have ultimately put an end to the internet per se. while i don't regard and the internet as lawless territory  (or that notion as desirable), in my opinion, online, the law should serve the medium, and as this is a new medium still very much in development, the law needs to adapt. thankfully, the bgh (highest german civil court) in the paperboy.de case argued carefully that deep-linking is not infringing copyright, looking at all possible issues with great care.  i hope this class continues this way. yum. just realised that i should ask prof.dreier whether there are other remedies in cases of deep-linking that results in stealing bandwidth. need to think this through. hmmm. interesting.  today's class made me wonder though: why do people do ip if they don't have the brains for the technical aspects of it?  odd.

      so i'm a year older, and all that has changed is that i now got one more thing to worry and feel bad about.  sitting at oskars yesterday morning with dirk, having (totally non vegan) breakfast, i got a 10-minute-quarter-life-crisis. 26 suddenly seemed awfully close to "late twenties", like almost 30. it just hit me that for years, i expected to live a different life at this age. like in melbourne, with a job, married, thinking about having kids. on some levels, i haven't totally dismissed these wishes. i want a life partner. i want to be done with uni. i want to lead the fullfilling life that i long for. it's ridiculous to feel bad about not having all that yet. i got to be patient with myself: i'm getting there, if slowly. it's been a strange last few years, i should be patient with myself, encouraging, instead of ashamed for not having reached my goals yet. at least i am still trying.   a strange kind of sadness lingered on from that 10-minute-quarter-life-crisis, for the entire day. we did plenty of nice things yesterday, and i was painfully aware that it is a luxury to just dismiss everything that needs being done for half a day and go shopping for presents and to the movies. - but still. with birthday money from the parents i bought myself the fancy salad spinner i have been needing for ages (no more swirling salad around in a dishtowel for me) and two cds, wilco's "a ghost is born" and eskobars "a thousand last chances". seriously good stuff. it was lovely to simply spend and hour at müller's cd department, as awful a place that is, just listening to new cds. i used to go cd shopping with evan a lot, and i miss that and being exposed to new music through him. later, dirk shopped with me for his present to me: lingerie, fire-engine red. really good stuff, lacy and see through, yet totally un-trashy. never owned red lingerie before, and this stuff is seriously hot. also got a squaky, inflatable nemo from dirk. so good i got a man in my life who knows and encourages my silly side. we had some birthday cake, too, and went out to see   urlLink hoellentour , a documentary by oscar-winning film maker pepe danquart on the 2003 tour de france, in the late afternoon.  i had read all the rave reviews the docu had gotten all over the place. each and every one of those reviews is very much deserved. hoellentour is a fantastic piece of docu filimg that won't just appeal to tour de france junkies like me. it's got it all: great imagery and colouring, gentle observation of its subjects, fantastic music and timing. - and all that real life drama! that last time trial in the rain, when ullrich fell, could not have been "scripted" any better... life makes for the best stories, after all.  plus: i really really like erik zabel now. i was always kinda indifferent towards him, admiring his achievements on the bike (most green jersey wins, most stage wins, consistent riding over years etc.) but not caring *that* much about him. this film has totally changed my view of him: good grace, is he an adorable, lovely, funny man! he came across as a totally natural, hard working, extremely funny, loyal guy. no attitude whatsoever. the 2003 tour must have been a humbling experience for zabel, crashing badly early on, no green jersey, losing sprints to petacci in the first half of the tour (before petacci, the loser, quit at the first molehill). zabel surely shows a lot of his true self in this docu. it's so funny to observe his relationship with rolf aldag: they seem like a long married couple with appropriate loving bickering and well defined roles (who gets which bed, who has control over the remote). zabels happiness for aldag after winning the mountain jersey is totally genuine and loving. - one of the best moments of the docu, i'd say. in contrast to that winokurov seems hard to grasp, floating around in the team doing his thing (like, almost win the tour), without really any attachements to anyone. maybe it's just the language barrier, who knows. overall, it is amazing that pepe daquart got such intimate access to the entire telekom team. - and he definitely made the most out of it. he shows more though, than just the workings inside a team. danqart portrays the strangeness of the tour in its entirety (think "caravane"!), the glorious scenery, the fans camping out in the alps and following the tour around, the historians who deem it the greatest sport event ever, the journalists, the little villages transformed for a day for the occasion.  the racing scenes feel like music videos with their electro-jazz soundtrack by till brönner and flowing camera movements and close ups of feet, legs, gear changes. the post race scenes are a stark contrast to that, totally quiet, zabel ponmdering the race or barely staying awake as legedary telekom physio "eule" massages his legs. i'll definitely watch the movie again, buy it when it gets out. its a much better 2003 tdf souvenir than any video that just shows the race as you got to see it on the telly anyway. am now even hotter for this years' tour than i was already. didn't think that was actually possible.  in the evening, tina came over to watch the football with dirk and me. rigos and champagne were consumed and we screamed at the telly, but alas, germany lost and gets to come home. bummer. tina and dirk got along well, too, and that's good, because those two haven't gotten to know each other much yet. i'll keep watching the euro though: at least england is still in, so i can keep wearing my "bored of the beckhams" shirt out. and well, there's sweden to watch, too, which are entertaining to look at because of  urlLink extremely   urlLink yummy   urlLink freddie   urlLink ljundberg . and portugal! figo! why not watch football for the men?  so yeah, the birthday is over, and some sadness still lingers on, and i have no real idea as to why. there's therapy tomorrow, and i quite simply do not feel like turning up there with these unresolved issues (yeah, i know, "isn't that what therapy is supposed to be good for?"), because i don't feel like therapy at all right now. i don't want to deal with my issues, thank you very much, i got too much work to do right now. not that i have any illusions regarding those 200 something pages i should read before sunday afternoon.  off to ip now. i got to remind myself that it's thursday.  and  urlLink thursday, i love law , right? right.

      looks like i don't need  urlLink google  anymore to stalk you, totte. i shouldn't be surprised, really, considering things written by you turned out to be in  urlLink books  i ordered without knowing about your input and all.  today, an email from a mailing list arrived in my inbox telling me about your latest gig, happening the next few days in northtown. it wasn't about you per se, that email, obviously, it was a mailing list for  urlLink niels frevert .  remember? for me, nationalgalerie's "indiana" was the soundtrack to that summer 10 years ago. you heard them play that spring, i think, you wore their goat image on a t-shirt.  urlLink i remember dancing with you to their song "die waffe" after stephan died . in my head, nationalgalerie's music and niels voice are forever connected with that summer.   "wie aus dem nichts/tauchtest du plötzlich vor mir auf/wie aus dem nichts/schnappten wir beide nach luft"  "von tief traurig bis überglücklich/ist es nur ein kleines stück/und irgendwann kommt/himmelhochjauchzendzutodebetrübt"  "alles so weit weg es kommt mir vor/als wäre ich Lichtjahre entfernt/zwischen vorher nichts und hinterher/ich schlafe morgens angetrunken ein/um möglichst lang im nirgendwo zu sein/der erste affe - lebend -/meilen unterm meer/fehlst mir/fehlst mir/habe sehnsucht/nach dir."   niels and nationalgalerie earned their firm spot on my favourites list that year, i still listen to their music a lot. do you?  so that mailing list email told me that niels will participate in a theatric improv show at northtown theatre company on football. a list of all other participants followed, and well, there you were, as well, with all your northtown literature homies. on the northtown theatre company website, "really good!" is the addendum to a description of what you do in that show. if i were in northtown, i might go and see that show, after all the usual ponderings about being your audience and all. - it does sound very entertaining, and i would like to see you perform to be able to compare your public persona with the one i used to know. turns out, i would have had to go twice though, because niels and you were not performing the same night. alas, i'm not in northtown out a few hundred km away, so there's no point in wasting time thinking about it.  how odd that just after i decided once again that googling you really is a fruitless/harmful/pointless endeavour because it keeps me stuck in the past, avoiding the now, i get emails with your name in it.  you got me, once again.

      it's been an odd day. - somehow nothing went as planned today. couldn't really afford that in a week as busy as this one.  dirk crashed with the grassboard yesterday afternoon, and after a restless night for both of us, we spend the morning at the docs, waiting more than 4 hours, re-reading various editions of stern and spiegel from last month. something is wrong with his knee: what it is, the doc can't see because of the swelling, so for now it's wait-and-see and a bandage that needs to stay on for 5 days. he might end up not being able to cycle or hike for the next six weeks. yeah, that would seriously suck and hamper our summer weekend plans. it also put our plans for my birthday on hold: no spa and sauna-ing for us tomorrow, with that knee bandage. no massage at the spa for me, either.  we couldn't have gone anyway: late in the afternoon, i got seriously sick. after avoiding dairy for weeks, it is not a good idea to eat fermented cow dairy, no matter how small the amount. it does not end well. it ruined my evening to the extend that i could not go to see "before sunset" with tina because the stomach cramps were so bad. and yeah, the going out for breakfast thing won't be happening tomorrow either. hooray!  so how did i spent my evening? i slept in front of the soccer. in all, today was to full of discomfort and unhappiness and worry and not nearly enough work, with too few successes, accomplishments and good things.  and now i'm a few minutes away from turning 26 and it's kinda gloomy, actually, because today was kinda gloomy and because it will be such a normal day tomorrow, that birthday of mine. i wouldn't want a big party anyway. - it just sucks that all the small plans we had made for tomorrow have fallen though. and it sucks that i haven't gotten any mail yet. and that i just don't know what nice thing i can do for myself tomorrow.  bummer.  alas, like i said a few days ago: there is a good thing about a bad day: all that room for improvement. i guess it goes for years of your life, too.  goodnight.

      last night, as i was preparing dinner, dirk rushed into my flat.  "you got to see this. i've never seen something like this before."  "what?"  "there is this couple downstairs at the cafe, right below my window. they've been sitting there for a few hours, just talking, and then about 15 minutes ago, they started kissing, and they have not stopped once to breathe! i swear, not once!"  so yeah, voyeurs that we are, we hurried downstairs into dirk's flat, raising the blinds to sneak a look.  and sure enough, they were still kissing, sitting on two different chairs, leaning towards each other. they were kissing without actually pausing for breath. or moving their heads. or moving at all, for that matter. it was funnny to look at.  they were young, the girl maybe 15, the boy maybe 18. and it was awful kissing. god, it was awful kissing. like watching a trainwreck, or roadkill or a press conference by george w. bush.  it looked as if the bloke was to blame, a total looser at pushing his awful kissing technique on a girl. i don't have enough negative superlatives to express how awful it was to look at, that kissing, from a technical point of view. you know, it was not sensual, exploring, tongue suckling kissing: it was the jaw grinding kind. rhythmical, fast jaw grinding. like chewing, really, in synch. at a rate of 45 chews a minute. think calfes sucking on udders. or something.  it looked unsexy. and unenjoyable, too.  i think it was thanks to that awful technique that they didn't have to stop for breath. but still, dirk and i, we couldn't stop watching, because awful kissing or not, they were still going at it without pausing. their endurance had some romantic appeal, chewing or not.  "maybe they are actually trying out for a kiss-a-thon, or something?", dirk wondered.  it was funny, really, us being so amused by their awful but enduring kissing. we looked down on the strangely kissing couple, being happy for them for their apparently successful first date. and sad for them, for their awful kissing technique. - not that that bad technique seemed to dull their enthusiam. i pondered aloud what the girl could do about the bloke being such a bad kisser anyway: at 15, one can hardly pull away and shriek "yuk!" after the first awful kiss on a first date. why not go along, trying to improve his technique? - not that it looked like she tried very hard tp push against his evil kissing technique.  i felt a little old, a little bit odd, being amused by bad, but enthusiastic public displays of affection. it's been more than a year since i had a first date with first time kissing, and while that kissing was a whole different league than that we could observe down there at the cafe, i missed it, the excitement of first date kisses.  after several minutes of watching the non-stop-kissing-chewing, one of us lowered the blinds and dirk and i quit the voyeurism.  and we kissed, standing in the middle of dirk's flat (no chewing involved), and i realised i am not missing out on anything, with not having first dates and first date kisses in my life right now. because one year after our first date, and our first kiss on augustinerplatz (a frightened little kiss it was, all exploring and sensual and wondering, the first first kiss in four years, and no chewing involved either), the two of us, we still kissing exceptionally well. :)

      i have a well documented history of stalking some of my ex-lovers. including you.  not stalking in the legal sense of the word, obviously, you would have noticed that by now, wouldn't you? i google you name, frank, and  urlLink tottes  name (he was your predecessor, the one i was still hooked on when in was with you) regularly, trying to keep an eye on what you do. yeah, that googling thing is kinda freaky, i know, and i'm sorry about that. it freaks me out to see people googling me successfully. a few years ago, a former co-worker from melbourne told me, passing me by during lunchtime in a cafe, that  "he had found my website" . my heart stopped, thinking he had found the blog, when all he had found was a silly photo page. but still: it's not a good feeling being searched out, i know that.  do you know why i google you? it's quite simple: i wonder how you are.  while i wonder how you are, however, it somehow feels to me as if i don't have the right to contact you directly. - it has been such a long time since we last spoke, it was such a strange thing, that thing between us, it looks a little strange to still think about someone you loved a decade ago, as a teenager.  for you, frank, and for totte as well, google regularly uncovers new stuff. it must be because you're both artists, both  urlLink having gained some kind of small-scale fame and success in recent years . as i bet you can guess, new websites either feature reviews or announcements for shows, happenings or readings that either of you takes part in. i'm pretty sure you've realised that someone is regularly checking google for you. the art studio you run with your mates has an excellently designed website: i guess that whoever maintains it knows a thing or two about referer stats.  do you wonder who that person searching for you is? do you assume that the mysterious google stalker is looking for you, or assume he is actually looking for the man who shares your name, the one who runs an eco-conscious weaving business with his wife in one of the eastern states?  i have your email adress; i have had it for a good long while, actually. - long before it turned up on your studio website, i had found it beneath a comic you had submitted to a contest. as you've noticed, i've never used it though, even though i've been tempted, more than once. what if you didn't reply? what if you wouldn't know who i am? what if my email to you got lost in spam?  you still live in the same city, in the same flat that you lived in 10 years ago, when i was madly in love with you, and oh so confused about men and love and life. i wonder whether the woman listed with you in the white pages is your lover, life partner or just a flatmate. she's an artist, too, that makes me lean towards thinking she's your lover. back in the day, you used to share that flat with many people. do you still live in the same room of that flat, the one towards the backyard, with the view of the roofs of the city? i loved that room, with its emptiness and wooden floor, with the drawings leaning against the walls, with a fern leaf i had sent from new zealand pinned over the pasteboard you used as your desk.  i have contact details for totte, too, and i haven't contacted him either. the last time i talked to him was in the summer of 2000. the last time you and i talked, it was the last millennium. was it in late 1996? early 1997? it was after my return from new zealand, for sure, and we sat in your room for a few hours, talking, for the first time ever totally openly and honestly, and we realised we had communicated really badly years ago. after that, there wasn't much left to say, was there? did we continue write letters afterwards? i can't remember. most letters i have from you are from 1994 and 1995.  quite obviously, the fact that i haven't contacted you doesn't mean i've forgotten about you, or stopped caring or thinking about you. otherwise i wouldn't be writing this, right? i haven't forgotten about you, at all. i think about you, often. i have written about you often, in the 4 years that i have been writing online. at the moment, i think about you a lot because of that  "10 year anniversary"  coming up. 1994 was such a wild year for me, and you were an essential part of it, with totte. the entire drama that totte and i were finally matches that alanis morissette song i never get tired of quoting regarding him:  "what's it been over a decade?/it still smarts like it was fourt minutes ago" . it is still strange to me,  urlLink how what happened between you and me was so entwined with what happened with totte and me . i rememeber that party that you both attended, me clinging to you to avoid totte, us kissing in the hallway as you left, me and totte hurting each other just hours later. it was one of the most bizarre nights of my teenage years. overall, it was a strange year, that one, but an enjoyable one, too. you were in it. and i loved you. more than you realised until after we were done.  somehow, these past years that i've been googling you and totte, i've always managed to find the announcement websites for events featuring your or tottes work just days after they took place.  there hasn't been a realistic chance in years to attend any of your events. when i actually knew about something in advance, it was either too far away (mostly in northtown) or i wasn't in the country in the first place. sometimes the events were not only too far away, they also seemed so small that contact with you was going to be invetable there. when you worked at some museum over the summer of 2001, offering printing workshops as part of an exhibition, i was simply scared out of my mind to go there. i worried that you'd see me but wouldn't recognise me. i worried that you'd see me and would recognise me. what good reason would i have had to be there at that obscuse exhibition in that tiny museum in the middle of nowhere?  i have seen quite a few of your paintings online, and i love them. they speak to something in me, and not just because they are yours. i can't describe what it is.  the performances you've been pulling off have made me laugh. i've only seen snapshots and short descriptions on a website on artists in your state, and those have been hilarious. reading kurt vonnegut's"slaughterhouse" to cows? collecting your navel fuzz? my only suggestion: i would have had that cow event sponsored by  urlLink peta .  a few months ago, google turned up a website that seriously shook me.  from februar to march, giant paperboats that you had built, some up to 9m long, were exhibited in your town, on the shores of the lake in the middle of your city.   urlLink      i was too late for that event as well. it would have been a perfect event for me to get a look at your work: no museum, paperboats in a glass pavillion by a lake, no opening times, no entrance fees, and the risk of running into you, even though i've been subconsciously longing for that, would have been low.  in august, those paperboats that you've built will be launched unto the lake, as part of your city's lake-fest. i can't tell you how tempted i am to come up for that. the timing is perfect: i plan on being up north then anyway. your city is just an hours drive away from hometown. the lake fest might be big enough to provide cover if i decide that i don't want to get in touch, but not so big that it might be impossible to get in touch, if i want to.  because that's what i want, i think. i want to be back in touch with you.  that's what's puzzling me so much, actually. i feel ambivalent about being back in touch with you. why do i want this? i've come to realise that the reason why i keep googling your name is simple: i miss you, in some weird twisted way.  i miss the strange things we talked about. i miss your view of the world. i want to know how you are, who you are now, whether you are happy, whether you love, whether you are loved. i'm quite sure about those latter things actually, i remember you as someone who longed to be a lover. there were always several women you fancied, or so it seemed to me. part of me wants to communicate with and understand you on a level i couldn't when i was 16 and you were 25. now that i have reached the age that you were when we were "together", i've come to realise that even though it felt as if you had the world figured out and were an adult, you most likely hadn't and weren't. i've been lost in many ways, and have been for years. i think you could relate. i think you could show me that yes, it is possible to live outside the norm, maybe just a little, and be daring. because you, frank, are daring. building giant paperboats to be launched on a lake? daring! i'm nostalgic about our relationship, too. you were the first man i ever slept with, and on some bizarre, hypothetical level i would love to show you i can do it a whole lot better than i could that day in may 1995. not that i assume you'd still be interested. not that i'd actually pursue that, ever. i'm a lot more shy than i was at 16. - it was all just a show then, anyway, that self-confidence that made you believe that i didn't fancy, didn't love you as much as i did, as much as you fancied, as much as you loved me.  above all, i'd simply like to meet you as an equal. i'd like to meet you at an age where the age difference between us matters a whole lot less than it did ten years ago. but i am fucking scared.  scared you won't recognise me. scared you won't remember me. scared we won't have anything to say to each other. scared of awkwardness. if i sit down and think, i know that you would recognise and remember me, even though it's safe to assume that you left more traces on my life than i did on yours. but what if we didn't have anything to say? and what if we did?  turning up unannounced at your art event would be such a cliche, too. kinda like copying  urlLink before sunset  (which i will see tomorrow night, by the way) - not that i think of us in such grande romantic ways, not that i think the little thing we had would be enough to turn our lives around. it was big then, at least for me, but it does not have a legacy large enough to expect any life changing experience if we indeed see each other again.  to be realistic, if i decided to go to your boat launch, i'd quite likely stand on the sidelines anyway and watch from afar. at least until i am comfortable there, until the main event is over, something like that. this event is something you've apparently planned for a good long while, and i surely wouldn't want to interfere. i guess i might even end up watching it, contacting you afterwards.  i'm well aware that i could just as well send you an email beforehand, saying something like  "i heard about that paperboat event. is that you? if so, i think i'll be there. see you then?"  that'd be quite an adult thing to do. bummer though, that despite my age, my adult type behaviour tendencies are not very distinctively developed.  i got some more weeks to think about whether i will go and watch your paperboats being launched. right now, i think i will.  i will see you there, then. will you see me there?

      why is it so hard for some people to recognize diary frauds?  a diary i had perviously never heard of went bust these past days. the regular readership of that diary shows the usual behaviour: outraged/amused/upset or still in denial. the apparent facts uncovered by that readership show that the creator of that diary lied, faked, lied, faked and lied some more, and has done so in at least one, possibly two previous incarnation(s).  with some time on my hands today, i read what is still left of that diary. while i could see why that diary gathered a big following, it made me wonder how anyone could believe that those writings were real in the first place. - the thing simply had all the usual signs of fraud written all over it.  there was drama, drama and more drama. there was an endless string of crisis, emergencies, borderline personality type behaviour, all over the place. there was simply too much happening, too. people taken into the house, babies being born, an internet start-up, affairs, affairs, even more affairs. there was enough sex for to fill a bunch of porn-scripts. the character was lesbian, and within a week apparently bedded 3 straight women. the language was very descriptive, abundant with adjectives and monologue. while some online writers use prose-like language and lots of dialogue. most of the time their personality shines through the prose and the dialogue. to me, real diary writing is usually..well, personal. lived. call it real, if you wnat.  nothing written on that diary seemed "lived" to me. it seemed dreamed, wished for, essentially imagined. crafted. apart from the elaborate wordings and strange descriptions, to me, the sex scenes gave it away. they were so..impersonal. the girl on girl sex sounded like the script for bad porn aimed at men. i don't doubt that there are lesbians in minnesota who love sex and enjoy strap-ons and who have lots of sex - i know that for a fact actually, because  urlLink heather  is one of them, - i just doubt that a minnesota lesbian that enjoys strap-ons would write about her sexual adventures as if she were a bloke, with bloke language. read heather. she's real, and her strap-ons, girls and sex are, too.   urlLink scarleteen  taught me a lot about realizing when someone is fraudulently posting. it was usually the drama that gave them away. the stories were usually outrageous and so complicated that they made the mind boogle. strangely enough, all fraudsters somehow managed to come up with eerily similar stories.  "pregant at 13 by mom's boyfriend, being thrown out of the house"  is an old favourite. the bored middle class girls in front of their computers who post that and similar crap don't realise they are diverting attention and time from those who actually are in trouble and need help. and that they are numbing the communities they troll at for the unfortunate few girls that actually are in that awful position. a pedophile once made up a drama prone lesbian teens that was into videotaping sex, trying to coax real teenage lesbian board members into swapping pics. a  middle aged man once went to extraordinary lenghts to establish a college-age lesbian persona in the online erotica and sex-ed communities as well, tricking many people in the process, making an austrian girl travel to the us to meet "her", later claiming that he was a pre-op transsexual. he didn't explain though, why there was that 30 year gap between his male and female personality. duh. back in the old opendiary days, i remember a diary that was quite similar in style of this recent fraud. it was about a harvard-studying, world-travelling, beautiful, genius teenage girl. on top of that, she had a rare disease, was still a virgin, did a triple degree, was bisexual and had an entourage of equally talented good looking boys who all kept diaries at opendiary, too! how useful! she comitted suicide by drowning herself in the canale grande in venice on ash wednesday, by the way. it was a captivating read, actually. - but oh. so. very. fake. strangely enough, all those people managed to draw copious amounts of people into their fabrications, getting them emotionally involved through and into their lies. sudden deaths, long breaks and disappearaces are essential to getting people worried about you, too. those fake people seem like vampires to me; sucking the attention out of too well-meaning, easily believing onlookers, feeding on their care.  it might be a hard realisation for those who feed the needs of those who keep fake diaries, who are drawn to the drama and want to help, urgently: real life is generally pretty boring and, well, normal. unless you are  urlLink salam pax , i guess.  life is about family and love and work and what you do on the weekend. it's about what happens in your city, in your community. it's about the things you enjoy, the things you hate, what you cook for dinner and where you holiday. it's the odd scene you passed by on your way to work. the ex-boyfriend you saw at the pub. whatever. "life" is what happens to someone every day.  sure, some people write only about certain aspects of their lives online, events they think will entertain others, events they enjoy sharing, things that present an image they like. - who could blame them? selecting what to write online is a way of shaping your memories and a way of shaping the image others have of you. i do that, too, and i think everyone does, more or less.  of course, everyone has times of drama and crisis and big events. good grace, if i think back to last year, even i had lots of drama. in the span of about 2 months, i split up with a boyfriend of almost 4 years who i had wanted to marry and move countries for; had an affair with someone from another country that i had met through diary writing (hurting him in the process, which i still feel awful about) and meeting dirk, essentially moving in with him within weeks. yeah, that was some drama. it was all real though. because it was so real, and because it was so weird and strange and hurtful for real, actual people, i never told the full story online, and never will. i left out things, edited myself, because i knew people involved were reading. and i still made awful, awful mistakes in the whole process. that's real life to me.  life for most people is not piggyback rides in the sunset just hours before you die (which another diary fraud claimed) or turning three people in a week into lesbians. not that i don't wish that life *should* be like that for more people. maybe that's another appeal of fraudulent diaries: people would love to have lives that exciting as well, with world travels, dinners on barcelona rooftop balconies, an ivy league college and more lovers than one can handle.  just today i got an email from someone telling me that even though he is a bloke, he can relate to what i write. - that's a fabulous compliment to get, i think. to me, it's a given that men can relate to what women write, and women can relate to what men write. at least to what we all write with an open heart. to me, the essence of writing and putting personal things online, and reading the personal things others put online, is connection. connection through universal feelings and events.  i read about someones experiences, and even if they are totally different to anything i have or anything i will ever experience, if it was written it with an open heart, i'll be able to relate to it. it doesn't matter if it's someone unlike me: a bloke with dyed hair in socal working in porn; a woman in australia worrying about her dying father; a mother writing about life with three young kids, describing her days, and how she and her marriage have to step back at times. it doesn't matter what the emotion is, it doesn't have to be all gloom and doom; humour offers real connection, too, i think. written with an open heart, honest writings enable others to get a glimpse of what the writer feels, share the joy and the burden and feel with them. in my opinion, many people read journals to recognise things about themselves, to not feel so alone with their feelings. to connect.  aren't we all just looking for connection?  i will sound all esoteric now, but i believe that we are all waves in the big old ocean of life. we are all, essentially, the same on the inside, even if no two waves look exactly alike. we have so much in common though, and we are all in this together.  how sad we rarely take the time to notice. how sad that those online frauds feed on that essentially human desire to feel the connection.  so why is it so hard for people to recognize diary frauds? - in my opinion, it is because we want to believe, because we want to connect, because we need that connection.  look at the waves, feel the ocean.  it is that easy, and that complicated, at the same time.   &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot &middot    post scriptum.  if in doubt that i am who i claim to be:  i have had telephone conversations with about half a dozen scarleteeners, including  urlLink heather , who also has a copy of my id. i have met another half dozen scarleeteeners, journaling and online people in person, among them the smart, adorable  urlLink seska  (nsfw).  so this caro person exists, and i am real. and really, who'd make up a life as everyday and uneventful as mine?  thankyou. goodnight.

      for two hours every thursday afternoon, i love law.  it's during the two hours that prof.dreier teaches intellectual property/copyright. (i won't link directly, but in case you're interested, he can be found at http://www.zar.uni-karlsruhe.de/zar/kontakt/mitarbeiter_seite.php?ID=3). he seriously rocks.  intellectual property is my favourite law subject. i've concentrated on it for years, and while my immediate plans to leave the country are on hold, i still hope to get an llm specialised in ip at some point in the future. i've heard it all before, patents, trade marks, copyright, but with this current lecture, i'm definitely learning a whole lot of new things. - apart from some more facts, i've been learning how to use my own head again, how to built better arguments. it's prof.dreier's approach to teaching that's making you think again. that's what makes his class so worthwhile.  as a law student round here, from day one, you're discouraged to use your own head. blame the system, if you will. when you first get into law school, they kill your language skills and force you to adopt the formal language of the law. then they make you insecure about your gut feeling, logic and insticts and teach you to rely on commentaries, and more commentaries and cases and more commentaries. sure, law and law research and teaching can only make sense when taught in the context of the system they exist in, but what's the point of killing all potential for new influences? all these years into law school, i still haven't understood it. the dogmas of law turned me off law, made me hate it for ages, and are the reasons why i'm still not done with it. all my ip profs, however, have taught me to use my head myself, to actually discover the reasons for opinions myself, to find my own reasons and to express them well. it's quite undogmatic, ip, more case law than most other fields in german law (we're a civil law system, after all), so it's essential that you can use your head. and i love that.  it's surprisingly hard to un-learn the braindeadness instilled by all law subjects but ip though. when i wrote my paper on the finer aspects of "use" in comparative advertisement in trade marks these last months (about the eugh "toshiba/katun" decision), i found it unbelievably hard to find words for my very own opinion. i managed though. i got my grade today, and while it's not perfect, and while i had hoped for something better, it's the best grade i ever got in law school. considering i puked about half of the 30 pages into the computer in the last 72 hours before handing it in, i can be quite satisfied, i think. go, me!  i first got interested in ip during my first intership at the now long dead german division of andersen legal. - i first looked into the actual text of trade marks law when phillip, the young lawyer i shared an office with, had to deal with a case that dealt with phone books and was actually quite high profile. these days, he's partenr in a specialised ip firm in düsseldorf. very cool. one of these days, i'll have to thank him for my start into ip.  during my first intership in melbourne, i got my first glimpses of hardcore licensing matters and confidentiality agreements...and i loved every minute of it. i was at a very technically oriented firm that had started out of a government department. their cases came from many different scientific backgrounds: mining, chemistry, biotech - it was very interesting to read about the projects on which universities, governments and private investors collaborated; projects that we built the legal groundwork for, trying to anticipate issues that could arise over the years to come. working there made me realise that i could actually like law. i realised that i could like it, when its not about people, but about science and brands and things, and when there's lots of potential for litigation. yay for litigation! my second internship in melbourne was serious boutique ip, and that's where i really found my place. the firm did lots of character protection and litigation, so the tiny office was full of toys and dolls and other property seized with anton piller orders. towers of tumbling monkey games! the best thing about my time there, however, was working on the trade marks application for a certain good looking, tiny, female australian entertainer with a penchant for golden hotpants and seductive posing. it was so hip! i even got to look at lingerie as part of the job. had i stayed with evan and moved to australia, i could have worked at that firm, while getting my degree. the job alone made me think hard about going to melbourne, even without the relationship with evan...but...it wasn't enough to counter the stalking-evan-factor that would have been a big issue had i immigrated (or at least tried to) after the break-up. but who knows, i might get back to the offer, if it was still there, of course, should i decide to and find the funds for an llm in melbourne, after all. yeah, i'm dreaming.  prof. dreier's class is hardly as glamourous as trade marks for kylie, but it's still the highlight of my week. this years class is his class of guinea pigs. we're an experiment. he started with a few weeks of intense fact cramming, sp that for the rest of the semester, we'll be holding discussion rounds on issues we prepare for in advance. while this kind of thing is standard teaching overseas, it's a brandnew concept, quite a revolution actually, for old-fashioned german law teaching. and you know what? it works. today was our first discussion round, and almost everyone had done their reading. while it wasn't as active and opinionated yet as i would have liked, it was pretty good. the only annoying bit was one classmate who was constantly speaking. he comes to ip from a geeky point of view, that kinda clashed with the copyright on happenings and art we discussed today. his views on art made me want to give him free tickets to the kunstmuseum in basel. duh. we also discussed copyright on legal drafts, and his arguments showed that he had never ever drafted something he was proud of. good grace, he should have seen the 100 something page thing we prepared on the career of the aussie entertaienr to show the mark had been extensively used prior to someone else registering it, and that we had overriding popularity. tsk. in my opinion, the term "work" should generally be very open. exclusion can happen later, that's what we have the barrier laws in ip for. why start excluding at a point when it's not needed yet, risk leaving out things that are worthy of protection and overly complicated the term "work"? tsk.  most interestingly though, it wasn't until a short discussion after class with said classmate and prof, that i heard  urlLink prof.dreier is actually the project lead for icommons germany ,  urlLink http://creativecommons.org/projects/international/de/">the german "division"  of  urlLink creative commons . bad of me, that i hadn't heard about it before. just shows how i compartmentalise my life. - i use a  urlLink creative commons license  for this blog myself, and have done so for a good long while, yet because this movement started in the us, and because my online writing is so non-law and hosted in the us and written in english, i read about something like creative commons and make up my mind about it, yet don't get into legal thought how that transfers to germany and german law. silly me. - i really need to change that. the creative commons system is so easy and excellent, such a useful, easy to understand approach to clarifying copyright issues and freeing content on the internet! fabulous prof.dreier is working on it. next week, creative commons will be the discussion topic for our thursday class, and hell, yeah, i'm already looking forward to it. i bet i'll be in agreement with the geeky classmate a lot next week.  and while i don't plan on talking blog during that discussion, it'll be a good time to start de-compartmentalising my life.  today was a good day, law-wise.

      good thing about bad days: all that room for improvement!  when a day is really awful, things can only get better.  - and they have tonight, and that's good. the main stressor was dealt with this afternoon (12 pages of civil law case stuff were written in 2 1/2 hours), some ebay gear arrived, there have been emails big and small that made life better (thanks,  urlLink you , and  urlLink you  and  urlLink you ) and soccer and dinner and talking about the silentargueing, and now life is better, much better. and i'll fall into bed quite likely waking up happier tomorrow morning than this morning.  thank you, life, for teaching me that showing weakness is strength.  namaste.

      i dislike disagreements, silence, sleeping alone, feeling punished and feeling manipulated. i not only dislike, but absolutely hate it when all this happens simultaneously, for no reason at all. and when the next day, it seems as if i imagined or made up all of this in the first place.  a night like last night makes for a seriously awful start into a day like today, a day that is way too grey, rainy and cold for a day in june anyway.  and yeah, there's a shitload of stuff on my plate that has to be done today, and i don't feel like dealing with anyone or anything. bad timing, me. with great timing, however, the tension headache has made a return, and there's no physio appointment till next week.  time to down some aspirin with pepsi light, eat something and get my act together. today, too, shall pass. somehow.

       urlLink       "..to remind you. of the things you know you will one day forget."   i'll never be a rock photographer. at least not without a new camera and a few years of traning.  the something for kate pics are dark, reddish, blurred. at least they are up close: when you re-size them to tiny, they are actually kinda good and the light effects look kinda funky, too. as unbelievable as it sounds, my good old camera finally died just as the pictures of paul dempsey and me were taken by the stalkerish luxemburg sfk fan. unbelievable. ever heard that strange saying about beautiful people making lenses split? odd. i still have hopes that thomas (one of the swiss) has some better pictures, including one of clint and me. or so i hope. i should find out this week. for now, i'll look at a blurried paul dempsey. still good looking, that man.  urlLink

      am i antisocial, by heart?  i wonder, really. these past weeks, i've gotten quite seclusive again, not returning calls, avoiding uni when possible, rarely being with anyone but dirk.  i've been a loner ever since that first bout of long-distance-relationship induced depression. over the last year, there had been improvements. the dating when the break-up happened, the yoga folks, tina back in my life and all, but now, i'm back to my loner-self, once again. the yoga folks, i've lost after the cult incident (my instructor joined a cultish group and tried to make me join, too. have been trying unsuccssfully to write about it for weeks); tina in austria, i've kinda lost over a non-issue (a man) for the moment (which sucks, beyond words); tina in freiburg, i've been rarely inclined to spend time with lately (for no particular reason); tessie, i haven't talked to since we spend a week together in march... i could go on, and on.  i'm such a loser when it comes to keeping up friendships, especially with women. it's not that i don't like having female friends. right now, i miss it, immensely, actually. i was never a girl with a big girly clique. when i started uni, there surely were a few girls, but it just wouldn't last. and then for years, i was too depressed to be good to anyone. i sincerely want to have a close confidante: it sucks so much that i can't talk about some things with someone. sure, there's dirk, but what if i want feedback about our relationship? some outside perspective form a close female friend would surely be nice. bummer is, that i am however, in such a non-giver mode at the moment, that i'm the worst kind of friend anyone can imagine. it's so hard for me to give right now, it feels like such a burden to be with people right now, that i just can't be bothered.  on a more general note, part of my difficulty being a good friend is that i have some seriously bizarre expectations towards people. as if that wasn't enough, i take ages to relax into  friendship and really be at ease with someone. it's not that i am shy or reserved. - i am the total opposite; really good at striking up casual conversation and making small talk, talking about everything and nothing.  i have a few big issues though. over the years of being depressed, i lost my understanding of the rules by which friendships function in this society. i un-learned what you can tell people, and when you can do so. i un-learned how loud one should speak and when, how you can tell someone you'd like to spend time with them. in short: i un-learned how one builds friendships. yeah, un-learning some society rules is generally cool, but un-learning this set of rules is kinda sucky, indeed. it turned me into being someone undefined, a blank page one time, overly open and talking intimately, speaking my mind the next. i never realised that it made people perceive me as being hard to grasp, really busy, and not needing new people in my life. when i was still with evan and lost and lonely, the first thing i'd usually tell people was that i was going to move to australia, soon. i subconsciously really didn't want to make them interested in me, i think, and didn't want to look like i needed friends, even though i did. and still do.  and yeah, there are the expectations, too.  tell me that you don't know who kofi annan is and you're doomed. talk mean about others, making me think you might do the same to me, you're doomed, too. be too blank, uninterested in life, doomed. be too shallow, doomed. leave me waiting for you for hours, doomed. it's all or nothing for me, and that's just so silly of me. so teenage. i would hope people would give me leeway as well, hell, i need that leeway from everyone these days, yet i have trouble giving it to others. fact is, by excluding people for those silly, un-important reasons, i am the one who loses in the long run.  it's ridiculous of me to expect that everyone sticks by my standards of what's important, because i know my standards are odd. someone who doesn't know who kofi annan is, or who listens to music i can't stand might still be a good communicator (the past has surely taught me that), someone to have fun with, who knows. i, surely, will never know, because i give up before i get a chance to find out.  i never expected perfection from a man, from love. why do i expect it from women then, from friends? maybe because i don't *really* want that close friends in the first place? i don't know. maybe it's actually not exactly perfection that i want, but that clicking thing that can be there when you fall in love, when you're on the same wavelength as someone. while it's perfect, it's not exactly perfection. it's recognizing a kindred spirit.  tina (in austria) and i we differ on so many things, yet we had this clicking thing for years, anyway.  i'm starting to wonder whether that might be the core of the issue, actually. maybe i can't bear having/building/developing any friendships right now, because i still grieve about not having her around right now. maybe i've been trying, all these months, with all those women who i've been around to re-create what tina and i had, to no avail (no one can substitute her, you know), instead of waiting and seeing which direction that friendship with that woman might take. deep down inside, i want what tina and i had, the real thing, no substitute. i worry that we will never have that again. the more weeks pass without words between us, the lesser the chance.  yeah, that's all seriously fucked up, i know.

      i just recently transitioned to being vegan, for a plethora of reasons: ethics, health, taste. a strange side effect has propped up these past weeks: my sense of smell has improved significantly. so much actually, that i can not stand cheese in the vincity of 5 metres. similar reaction to meat.  it's not hating cheese, or wanting to be disgusted by it: i never cared much about cheese in the first place. now, however, its smell is literally making me sick. i can't even wash the plate dirk prepared his cheese roll on, and can smell that he touched cheese with his hands even as he washes them. other smells offend me in a similar way: smoking and pot have been really revolting lately, as well. cheese, however, or rancid dairy of any kind (yoghurt, butter, whatever) is worst.  any vegan reading this who can attest that i am not alone? have been googling variants of vegan/smell/sense of smell/cheese to little avail.  puzzling.

      i've been feeling a little lost these past few days, apart from the something for kate induced high on wednesday night. maybe it's something in the water. maybe the venus transit or the heat yesterday that totally knocked me out. something must be to blame.  i've simply been out of synch. no wonder, really. i haven't been working out, i haven't done any yoga or mediating, i haven't done enough work for uni, haven't fed myself well at all. i haven't been very happy, apart from wednesday night, really: headaches, backaches, tiredness. the usual, really: the body telling me it doesn't like how i'm living, that i need to look after myself a bit better.  in the most bizarre twist of our otherwise so boringly normal happy loving relationship, somewhere these past days, dirk and i reversed our relationship roles: i started needing lots of lonetime and space, he started getting all cuddly, sometimes insecure and totally in-love. once we realised what we'd been doing, it was actually kinda funny. until then though, it was a rather disturbing experience. i felt quite awful, and while i tried to remain compassionate with dirk, i *still* needed my own space. at least we've both gained a whole lot more insight in what it's like to be the other one. strange to experience once again that our relationship needs opposites, contrast. we're so similar, dirk and i, more similar than we really want to acknowledge, that we go to extraordinary lenghts to be different. it's all normal though, i think. we're a man and a woman, after all, and we're together. we're different. - and we obviously need all kinds of emotions, all kinds of mechanisms in our relationship at all times. and that's funny. and adds to the adventure.  we're having a little at-home-date tonight, i'm cooking dinner ( urlLink vegan carrot stir fry ), and we'll have some quality time later, which we hope to stretch into the weekend. there's lots of study that needs being done and dirk needs to apply for school for next year, too, but we're planning on doing some shopping for some summer clothes and shoes tomorrow, which should be nice. and maybe there'll be some time for yoga, as well. i sure hope so. i need to relax, stretch and chant. and get in synch.   om tare tuttare ture swaha    urlLink     urlLink       om shree saché macha prahbu ki jai paramatma ki jai om shanti shanti shanti om

       "i could feel what it would be like to be in the country again, walking across the grass under that moon when the world seems to be silent. i wanted to be out there so badly that it was hurting me. it was kind of that sense of loss you have when someone dies. you want to sink to your knees and keep saying "no, no, no, no," as if that could somehow change things. it was so beautiful, remembering, but still so painful. that's exactly the kinds of things i need, because it stokes the fire in me that wants freedom. it strengthens my will."    urlLink a new letter from damien echols , posted by  urlLink margaret cho .

       urlLink     &nbsp; urlLink     yes, this is a setlist! and yes, that writing is the same as on all sfk cd booklets. he.  i'm underslept, overexcited, dehydrated, underfed and my feet hurt. - post-concert hangover, i'd call it.  the concert rocked. totally. it was as signifcant to me as the first time seeing u2. yeah, quite unbelievable, i know.  fantastic location, tiny, tiny, tiny club. super-tiny. capacity maybe 500, 2/3 full. we were 5 sfk fans (probably more after they were done with their show), we found each other, stood right at the tiny stage (like a metre away from the band) and rocked together. a short, but powerful, guitar-heavy 40 minute set was played, with a surprising amount of old songs. it was awesome, totally overwhelming, because it was so good, something i had waited for for so long. i cried during an acoustic version of "you only hide". - and yeah, we later chatted with the band, who was down-to-earth, super-friendly and cool. and good grace, are these people attractive! the artsy pics on the cd covers don't do them justice. just as predicted, i wasn't cool: i took pictures of me with paul dempsey. he.  those plus a detailed report, soon. i need some brekkie now. and some music. yeah: sfk. what else? :)  (hmmmm!  urlLink something for kate visual tour diary europe 2004.  photos of karlsruhe, soon? - surely, yesterday's concert was a lot smaller than any depicted there.)

      i really should not tell anyone how many weeks it took me to realise the pun about  urlLink one night in paris  (released today, and quite likely the dvd dirk will buy a dvd player for).  one might get the impression that i actually still am the tame catholic girl i should have grown up to be.

      today! today! TODAY!  urlLink something for kate!   urlLink at substage!  in karlsruhe!  supporting  swedish brit-poppers  urlLink eskobar ! today!  i woke up thinking:  "TODAY!" , goosebumps all over. i kid you not. i wish i was. or not? i don't care. i'm feeling good. fantastic. super-great. teenage. the last days were a little gloomy, today is not. bright blue sky and sunshine and 30+°C do help, too.  maybe i am tuning into my 13 year old self in a way, 13 year old caro on the day she was allowed to see bono on stage for the first time. that day was june 4th, 1992, the tour was zoo tv, a meagre 12 years ago, and today indeed has similar significance. no, no, no, i am not overrating paul dempsey, i swear!  i still remember the first time i ever heard a something for kate song. it was just after christmas 1999, the evan affair was in its first tender weeks, and he had given me a tape. i was preparing lunch at my parents place, in the kitchen that doesn't exist anymore, and put the tape in my mom's stereo.   "picked the wrong time to be looking up at the night..."  paul dempsey's voice started floating through the rooms.  "before you jump you better think twice/no angel's gonna appear to offer you advice/whatever you want/whatever appeals to/whatever it is you haven't got/sentimental/knowing/sentimental/knowing when you get on that road i've got no idea where you're going..."  later, the pushing guitars and heavy bass of "hallways" and "electricity" would make the floor shake, just a little, with evan happily jumping through the rooms, playing airguitar. i fell in love with him, just a little deeper, then. i fell for "something for kate" then, too.  it wasn't just because it was one of his his favourite bands from melbourne: it was indeed, purely for the music. it was something about paul dempsey's voice, about the way the songs were crafted, that totally moved me. "beautiful sharks" would turn into the soundtrack for that winter, the first weeks evan and i were together. after evans return to australia, i'd sit alone at my computer, listening to the album and using the lyrics in my opendiary.  "slowdancing/with someone who is a thousand miles away" . yeah, i was lonely with this music, too. strange really, considering this was  "ours"  in a way, "back to you" being  "our"  song, it's lyrics strong, giving this onlinething a name, for a good long while. a song evan told me he got sad to, during a concert in melbourne, thinking about me.  the relationship i had with evan included lots of music. many cds i have today were presents from him, bands he told me about, music we listened to together, concerts we went to. cd shopping at jbhifi was almost an everyweekend thing we did when together in melbourne, when he'd be done working at myers. it's always been a strange thing for me to listen to music no one around here listens to, no one else likes. music loving for the music only, in an absence of live performances and videos and marketing. among all the great music i got to know through evan, something for kate always remained my favourites.  evan gave me their third album, echolalia, as a present for my birthday in 2001 (the year that i could not come to australia), signed. hearing those songs for the first time, midday on a hot summer day on my balcony with tina, it was like meeting a long-lost friend and discovering all was still fine: the songs were so shiny and new, less raw, beautifully arranged, yet deeply familiar. during my extended stays in australia in the southern winter of 2002 and the southern summer of 2002/2003, i each time managed to miss out on concerts by them by a few days or weeks. - evan would see them on all their tours, as he had for years. he and his friend santa, who had been following the band since their darkest days, kept telling me how good they were, live. i kept joking that the day i moved permanently to australia, they'd split up, so i would never get to see them in concert.  however, it was us that split up, evan and i, not the band. afterwards, i could barely listen to any music, because everything was full of connotations and memories. i got another package of cds from him, directly from whammo, for my birthday after the break up: gelbison, the new powderfinger, and something for kate's "déjà vu" single. - the album wasn't out then.  i didn't get the album until it was finally released round here, a few weeks ago, and it was the same long-missed-friend thing as before, even though i did notice that many of the rough guitars i loved so much have given way to subtler tones.  so tonight, i will finally see something for kate, with 4 1/2 years of anticipating a night like this behind me.  i still can't really believe that it will indeed happen tonight. in about 5 hours, i'll be on a train to karlsruhe.  yeah, my expectations are high, and yeah, the are just supporting, so yeah, they will quite likely just play new songs to promote the album, but what it boils down to is that i will see them perform, which i never expected to happen, since the breakup last year. i always expected to see them in melbourne, maybe at that cool place in st.kilda, with evan.  that will never happen.  but i will see them tonight, in karlsruhe, alone. and while it's different than i expected, it will be good. i will be in first row, amazed, knowing all the lyrics. possibly the only person in karlsruhe to have heard about the band before, to own all albums, plus some rare little somethings. and while being my 13 year old self, i'll attempt to try to hide it, my deep attachment to the music, just a little. the fandom i openly expressed at 13 -standing on my seat, shouting "bono! bono! bono!- doesn't quite fit my oh-so-cool-self these days.  yeah, i just wrote  "attempt to try to hide" . he. :)  i'll quite likely fail. so i'll quite likely be totally uncool. my camera, cd covers and black waterproof pen are already in the bag i'll take along, anyway. he.

      this morning, on the way to the bakery and the farmer's market, i took a moment to look through the telescope the local optician had gracefully placed in front of his shop door to watch for a few moments as  urlLink venus crossed the face of the sun . i had unsuccessfully tried to buy some protective sunglasses at his shop yesterday, when he'd told me he'd be outside with his telescope all morning, so people could take a look. very nice of him.  with the transit not observable without protective eyegear, it was strange to see that little black dot on the face of the sun. strange what a small event this was, from a purely visual point of view. strange that this was something that no one living today had ever seen before.  i wasn't dissapointed though. i hadn't expected something "grande", more obvious. i knew what was to come. fact is though, this was a grand event, in a non-obvious way. i felt (now, that sounds odd)  "chosen"  to be able to see venus, that black little dot in front of the sun, while everyone was going along their day, passing around me and the telescope in the middle of the city, sun shining brightly above everyone, without any indication that what was happening up above was quite grande - astronomy wise.  sure, the  urlLink eclipse of 1999  was a whole different kind of experience, larger than life (for a multitude of reasons, not just the moon/sun thing: i had a fucking great time.), but still: it was funky to see our planets move today.

      i finally saw  urlLink the trailer  yesterday. with my ancient, snail-like dial-up at home, and the constantly flipping computer currently without audio, i watched it at the laundromat, with headphones. several times in a row, actually. it indeed is, like a  urlLink dailykos  post yesterday called it  urlLink the best-anti-bush-ad, ever .  wow.  priceless imagery, priceless soundbites ( "i call you my base" ,  "now watch this drive" ,  "bad for the people, good for business" ), fantastic editing. knowing michael moore, i am sure there is better yet to come and we've seen nothing yet with this little trailer. and how i love his populism!  "let me read to you the patriot act!" . i'd never think i'd like populism, but facing this kind of a situation, it's direly needed to wake people from their collective consumerist stupor: time to show them the real bush behind the marketing. - or at least shake up their image a little bit. i am, in all honesty, counting down the days till the documentary reaches the screens and will pre-order tickets for opening night, as soon as possible.  i was laughing hard and getting really excited, freaking off an american woman (who happened to get some things faxed by dieter as i was watching the trailer again and again) in the process. she was there with her daughter, and when dieter chit-chatted with her, asking whether they were on holidays, she tried to explain something in german about her daughter, the air force and boot purchasing for the army.  it was a lil' puzzling, indeed. it felt like she didn't want to elaborate the matter with us rampaging anti-american leftists, and i didn't feel like trying to uncover what she actually meant either. strange situation.  another fantastic anti-bush ad:  reagan's speech at the 40th anniversary of d-day intercut with dubya's shabby speech on sunday. while i reckon that reagan was not much brighter than dubya, he could at least deliver the lines written for him. sure, it must be a substantial loss for his family, even though i guess (from personal experience) that after ten years with alzheimer's, it was on many levels a relief for him and them as well. i can't, however, get over the amount of history re-writing that's currently happening because of his death, at least in the non-european media i get to see round here. sure, funerals are a time when people tend to look at the good things to remember and gloss over the bad things about the deceased, but good lord, what are they doing these days?  from what i've seen on the non-european telly these past days, reagan not only ended the cold war, no, he was also the first to "care" about the us's neighbours in middle america (how many innocent people died because of his politics in el salvador, honduras, guatemala? - all i say is  outside, it's america. outside, it's america. ). i haven't heard anyone mention the disasterous foreign politics (anyone realised yet, that supporting islamic fundamentalists to counter soviet communism was a bad idea back then, and one of the reasons for the current shit we're all up to our necks in?) or the toll his interior politics took on the already poor. i will always remember him as the president who failed to act during the aids crisis. i will remember him  urlLink photoshopped with kaposi sarkoma lesions all over his face in colors magazine . on the weekend, i saw a memorial docu on him, which featured a musical evening at the white house which culminated in nancy and him singing with the actors. - all that (apparently) during the iran contra affair. good grace. it made me cringe. and cringe. and cringe some more. almost as much as dubya playing golf.  on a nicer political note, i went to see  urlLink joschka , our  foreign minister, last thursday. what fun! they hauled him down here as part of the green european election campaign, and it totally paid off. somehow i had never realised what an exceptional spontaneous speaker he is: a  full-blown, die-hard politician, awfully quick-tongued and spontaenous. there was lots of shouting from the audience, as customary at  urlLink green party  events, and joschka took the time to discuss things in detail with the shouthers. perfect opportunity for him to show off, and fun to watch as well. the most notorious shouters belonged to a group of anti-globalist anarchists, who kept shouting things about leaving nato, dissolving all borders and joschka having sold out on his firm belief in socialism. they actually accused him off dropping his radical beliefs  "in order to become foreign minister"  to which he just joked that yeah, when he figured out in 1982 that party-politics was the way to achieve something and joined the early greens, he had done so because he knew that 16 years down the road, he'd be in a ruling coalition and foreign minister. yeah. some moments were thought provoking. he actually got me to re-evaluate my stand on the eu and turkey and after a shout regarding iraq, he asked the audience to imagine what our current situation would have been like if the spd/gruene coalition had not been re-elected: stoiber would have surely send german troops to iraq, german soldiers would be dead now, and a madrid-style attack on german soil not exactly unlikely, too. overall, the evening just confirmed my decision to vote  urlLink green  in the european elections, even though their stand on ip issues sucks, big time. fact is, when it comes down to it, i simply care more about our european constitution, a ban on gm-food and cloning , sound environemental standards and guidelines and other typically european issues than about ip. bad ip lawyer-to-be, me.  lastly: how good americans care so much about   urlLink the sanctity of heterosexual marriage .

      i'm not just tired: i'm totally exhausted. from doing nothing. nothing it all.  there is so much to be done though, that it's totally overwhelming me today. laundry. household chores. some shopping. just *things*. with my ocd in overdrive, i can't even look at anything (the floor, the kitchen, the bathroom) without being disgusted, feeling an overwhelming urge to clean, yet being overwhelmed by the amount that needs to be done. to top everything off, it's grey and rainy, outside. so grey and rainy that all i want to do is hide beneath my blankets and sleep.  i know that once i start, once i turn on some good music and get going it will be better, but right now it feels monumental, this little bit of cleaning this little flat. it's ridiculous.  and all just because i feel lonely.

      for the first time in a week, i'm alone for several hours at a time.  this past week has been hectic with being sick, boring market research work combined with a trip to the parents and visitors, dirk's uncle and cousin, for the past three days. they left with dirk around noon, heading for basel, to see  urlLink the soccer tonight .  so i am alone. and instead of using this much missed lonetime to the max, studying (despite the holidays), cleaning the flat or grocery shopping, i've been sleeping, wasting time online, finishing  urlLink jörg böckems captivating junkie/journalist autobiography , watching the telly, pruning the garden and scaring the evil  urlLink aphids  away, that have invaded the  urlLink sweet peas  and the daisies. yay for rape oil.  maybe that's just what i needed, after all: catching up on lonetime, wasting time, all by myself. will pamper myself a bit tonight in the bathroom with lovely  urlLink lush  things. - and even after that, i'll still have the entire evening for doing actually productive things. like washing this mornings massive amounts of dishes.  he.  i'm loving it, my lonetime. i still hope dirk will manage to catch the last train out of basel though, so i get to sleep next to him tonight. don't need *that* much lonetime, after all.

      it's been a perfect day at the tour, perfect from start to finish.  it started as we were driving into besancon. a phonak van was in front of us, and a cyclist, too, and as we drove past, i realised that it was  urlLink oscar sevilla , warming up. yay!  my dad and i found a good parking spot, just about 500m away from the tour route in downtown besancon, about 2 cycling minutes behind the starting area. it was a perfect viewing spot, too, a long ascent where you could see far in both directions, with a bend, too. no careful planning could have provided us with&nbsp;a better spot, really.  we had lovely neighbours standing next to us. to the left a super-friendly french father and son team. we had fun attempting to actually discuss cycling with bits of french, german and the use of hands and feet. to our right was a group of american blokes in their early thirties (chris, doug and alex) all of them currently living in basel. chris, was as much of a cycling crack as me, so i had someone to discuss cycling things with en detail, you know, whether  urlLink robbie mcewen &nbsp;is a fair cyclist, whether  urlLink thomas voeckler  might win the tour one day, why the people who were calling  urlLink jens voigt   "judas"  on the way up l'alpe d'huez have no clue about cycling etc.  the other two were tour virgins. alex, though being a tour first timer, turned out to be interesting company, too. he used to be in the marine corps, went to iraq last year, and he's not in support of dubya. an interesting conversation was had between the two of us on american foreign politics and everything else and it might get into a second round, too, as basel is just an hour away, and as he has only been to freiburg briefly. we might&nbsp;go to next saturdays  urlLink time trial 2  in bühl as well, or at least i asked chris and him.&nbsp;it would surely be nice. lance will be there, after all, as well. alex, doug and chris were meticulously prepared: they had lots of good food (including giant sandwiches and fruit salad), beer to share (!) and an american flag.  so i ended up standing in front of, or next to an american flag for the whole day, mostly speaking english, too, and wearing my  urlLink "live strong"  shirt supporting lance. the only way to not appear american would have been a large&nbsp; "i'm german, though!"  sign, but that would have gotten in the way with the clapping, cheering and photographing. so i tried not to care too much. our little group was later joined by fred, another american and a complete tour viewing pro for years who was fun to talk to as well. he actually spend yesterday in paris, lucky him.  so my dad and i were in good company, in a good spot, and in such a good mood that the awful amount rain that came down on and off for the first few hours didn't matter that much.&nbsp; later it got hot and sunny and perfect. i could not come up with a better place to be, a better thing to do than standing at the side of the road in besancon, in the sun, waiting for lance in good company, drinking beer. i was totally and completely and utterly happy. and i still am, actually.  and then the riders came, jimmy casper, laterne rouge, being the first one. and the fun started. the atmo was lovely, the cheering was good because among those last riders there were tons and tons of french. at some point, my dad went to a different space to watch, and while that wasn't exactly what i had hoped for for our father/daughter tour de france weekend, it was alright. i wasn't all by myself, after all.  so we cheered. we guessed who was coming next, because no one had brought, and no one around us had, a classement generale from the previous day (i had tried to but the internet cafe suffered from dsl death friday night). we tried to come up with all the first names of the riders riding past, as the cars following them only showed their last names. we did an organised  "aussie aussie aussie! oi! oi! oi!"  cheer for the aussie riders. we spoke cycling. we cheered. i took lots pictures and some even turned out fabulous (blessed be my mothers' minolta dimage camera). if that law thing won't work, i'll be the next  urlLink graham watson . he.  between the riders, some of those who had already finished were already cycling home. poor  urlLink liberty seguros cyclists  not only had to ride home, but they had to ride home with big backpacks on their backs as well. i would have expected them to have better funding.  at some point, three  urlLink t-mobile  people, among them  urlLink erik zabel , were riding home slowly (and without backpacks) among lots of cheering and clapping and hoopla. zabel looked totally happy and relaxed, being on his way home and all, and started giving high fives to fans as he rode past.  tour de france groupie confession of the day: i shared high fives with erik zabel. ha!  i have washed my hands since then though. because as lovely as erik is, he ain't lance after all.  so what can i say? it was a lovely day. late in the afternoon, the top ten riders cycled past, the cheering got more intense, the excitement got, too, and then it were jan ullrich, andreas klöden and ivan basso riding past, all 2 minutes apart from each other, and then came lance, riding furiously and faster and better than everyone else, everyone cheered and clapped, the maillot jaune was shining in the sun, and within seconds lance had passed, and the moment had, too, and the spectacle was over. they were the highlight of it all, of course, these few seconds (and i have a video to relive the moment, too) and then everyone went home.  we said our goodbyes, the blokes and i, my dad came back to the spot i was standing, and we started walking back to the car.  all day, i had seen people wearing lance's yellow  urlLink "live strong"  wristband, and all day i couldn't make myself ask one of them whether they got them from somewhere right there, or whether they had brought them from home, having bought them from the net. because i longed for one. i've longed for one for ages. on the way to the car, there was a huge group of american cycling tourists, all very fit looking, all wearing yellow "live strong" wristbands, right in front of me. so i finally chatted to the man right in front of me.  "excuse me sir, i just realised that you're all wearing the live strong wristbands. did you get them around here somewhere?"  it must have been a bit odd to be asked that by someone wearing a yellow t-shirt inscribed with "live strong". he explained that they got them earlier during the day from a car during the caravane. i said something about not seeing that and he was friendly enough to explain that you could get them at niketown shops in the us, and online, too, to which i replied that i knew that, but that they didn't ship overseas. i thanked him for the info, we said goodbye, and he walked faster, returning to his group. i was a bit bummed out that i had missed that chance to get that muchly desired wristband and my total high of a day of tour watching, was just a little bit dulled. just a tiny tiny little bit. and then, with a few steps, the american cycling tourist came back to me, the yellow wristband that had been dangling round his right wrist now in his hand, and he pushed it into mine, saying something like  "you know what? there you go, have mine, i know you'll really enjoy it".  and i was stunned.  "thank you. thank you so much. you've just made my day even better than it already is."  i replied.  "i thought so!"  he said to me, smiling broadly, jogging back to his group. that's cycling fans.  a day at the tour. can you imagine anything better to do in july? i most certainly can't.

      i bought a yellow t-shirt yesterday. it's really very yellow: canary yellow. as yellow as it gets.  i've never owned something this yellow before. my only other yellow piece of clothing, my  urlLink bored of the beckhams shirt , is much less bright, much less yellow than this t-shirt.  this morning, i carefully wrote  urlLink "live strong"  on it, with black textile paint, in that nice bau urlLink haus 93  font. why, you may wonder? - i'm getting ready for the tour.  my father will arrive this afternoon, and very early tomorrow morning, we'll drive the 160km to besancon to watch this years' final time trial. i can't imagine anything nicer to do tomorrow than standing at the side of the road for a whole day, shouting  "allez! allez! allez!".  we've done this before, my dad and i, watch the tour. 4 years ago, the tour visited this hometown of mine, and my dad visited then, too. we had two glorious days: my city was arrival town for one stage, and start town for the final time trial. those two days were the foundation for my fascination with the tour. - a year later, when the tour was on the other side of the border,  urlLink my dad and i saw two more stages .  until the tour of 2000 i had never thought much about cycling as a spectator sport.  sure, i heard about the tour and knew who won when and who the biggest cyclists were. &nbsp;sure, i was excited when ullrich won, i heard about the doping scandal in 1998. sure, i admired what the cyclists did in the mountains. - but i never cared much. had someone asked me, i would have probably deemed it pretty boring to stand by a road for a few hours, waiting for the woooosh of the peloton, a whole 5 seconds worth of cyclists riding past you.  but watching the tour, seeing it in real life, is so much more than those 5 seconds, so much more even than those 5 seconds 147 times in a row, as my dad and i will experience them tomorrow at the time trial, when each cyclist will ride alone, 2 minutes apart.  to me, watching the tour is about excitement, about passion, about speed, about meeting people, about dedication, about tradition, about fun, about support for those who participate in what i reckon to be the hardest sports event in the world.  if you've never been to the tour, it might be hard to imagine how cool it is to wait for the peloton. the waiting begins in autumn, when the tour route is announced. where is the best place for me to see a stage? on the selected day, you stand at the side of the road in some obscure french town as more and more people turn up, the entire life in that city standing still, in wait for the tour. you search for the best spot to stand, which can be a bit tricky when not familiar with the city. wide curves are good, those where you can see far in both directions, and you choose to stand on the outside of the curve, even though that might mean that the riders might be a few more metres away.  you talk to the folks next to you, and they come from all over the world. i've personally&nbsp;stood next to&nbsp; half of europe, americans, canadians. - no matter where you are from, you share one interest, and it's cycling (at least on that day) and you share theories on tactics and discuss favourites. those who are fluent in french and who are experienced tour watchers bring portable radios, and they are the ones to turn to with the neverending question of  "where's the peloton right now?"     at some point, the street is closed, more or less (depending on the size of the city you're in), and the caravane arrives. it's sponsor cars and carriages giving away free samples and pressies, from coffee, to sausages, to tools for cheering (green hands, white inflatable tubes), the giant yellow lion (the one that credit lyonais gives to the winner of the yellow jersey every day) drives past, just as a giant aquarel water bottle that sprays the audience with water on hot days, and huge cyclist figures representing the different jerseys. official yellow tour cars sell memorabilia.  after the caravane, police rush through, and cars from the organisation, and more police, and more extremely fast cars from the teams and you wait and wait some more, and the excitement rises and the people move closer to the street and you wait some more and then you'll start hearing the helicopters. with the helicopters comes the breakaway group/the poursuivants/the peloton. and you cheer. and you try to take photos. you cheer some more. you clap, showing your admiration. you attempt to see who's where.  and then they are past you, and more cars rush by until the van with the red sign passes and it's over for the day and you're happy and elated that you were there, for this giant sport event. and then you say goodbye to those you spend the day with and drive home, with the radio on, so that you get to hear what happened to the peloton after you saw it.  i'm so much looking forward to tomorrow. i haven't been this excited in ages. it will be so cool to see lance in yellow. it will be so cool to wear my undergound lance support shirt; underground, because i just could never ever bring myself to waving an american or texan flag, not just because this is france, where lance is still resented on some level. i'm excited about who we'll be meeting, about how many people will be there, what the atmo will be like, how jan ullrich will hold up. i'm excited about spending time with my dad.  i'll see the tour tomorrow. and good grace, i. can. not. wait. any. longer.  finally lance will actually hear me yelling my support. - it's been a bit ridiculous, screaming at the telly these past days, jumping around the flat as he took the yellow jersey and won those stages.  time to get ready for tomorrow. i need to buy a small radio and paint my toe nails yellow.

      it's been a strange few days, these past ones.  they have been busy, but thankfully not overly stressful. - the semester is winding down, so as i settle into a study routine for the summer, things should get more relaxed, even though i still have a rather decent workload. - there's another seminar on chiemsee in november, and i am thinking about writing another paper. should i or shouldn't i? maybe on copyright contracts? or biotech patents? i'm tempted, even though it would be for nothing but fun. - it wouldn't even be helpful job wise: having all your seminar papers (and grades) from one person looks kinda odd, and i already have tons of classes from max.   in recent weeks, there were a few cool law events to get me motivated for the study-filled summer; the contracts in ip seminar and a trip to the bgh, the highest german civil court.  the contracts in ip seminar was cool. - we did some role play to work on our negotiation skills. we drafted. we discussed litigation strategy. - and i loved it. i can do this stuff, and do it well. go, me. and thanks to my melbourne law firms: you rock.   the bgh trip was by my cartel and competition law class; our prof is a judge at the cartel senate, so we got to see him at his dayjob. - very entertaining, he was just as hardcore and inquisitive as in class, while the overall atmosphere at the bench was quite relaxed and friendly. the trip meant getting up at 5:30am which kinda sucked, but in the end it was all worth it: the three cases we got to see were all entertaining and cool and one (concerning market definintion) was very important, too.the only possible improvement: they could have served coffee. thankfully i wasn't alone in having trouble staying awake: some of the judges dozed off, just like i did.  what i liked most about the happenings at the bgh was that there was real argument happening, real discussion, real work. - very much unlike what happens in lower courts. it was so inspiring to watch.the bgh lawyers reminded me of the barristers i got to see at work in australia: well spoken, argumentative, quick minded. i loved it.  the best, however, was the bloke sitting in from the cartel department though: excellent rhetorics, firm legal arguments, fun to watch. until last week, i surely *knew* what the cartel department did as amicus curiae, but somehow i couldn't figure it out, but now i do, and it is oh so cool and funky.  now i only need to get my two exams, and do so quickly, join the bar, work a few years, become super firm at litigation, turn 35 and somehow get one of those muchly desired admissions at the bgh (it's an exclusive club of only 31 lawyers) or join the federal cartel department's litigation team.   yeah, i wish.   for the moment, it should be more than enough if those good experiences help me to get through the boring weeks of studying and paper writing in the middle of summer.  hmmm, motivation! tasty!   this week, it's not that good, my motivation regarding law: my batteries are running a bit low, even though there ain't that much on my plate for the week. - with everything winding down at uni, i've got time to catch up with some people (cooked an excellent three course&nbsp;vegan dinner for till on tuesday and will be meeting thomas again this afternoon), time to get ready for my dad's visit over the weekend, time to watch the tour, time to work out. i've finally been working out regularly again for the past three weeks, and that's been good for my overall happiness. my body feels so much better when it's in motion. of course, i've been overdoing it, just a little bit, as well. just as usual, i have trouble realising when i've done enough. because in my world, i never do enough, no matter what i do.so even though i feel a tiredness lingering in my legs, i went to the gym last night, intending to go to a spinning class, followed by an hour of pump and an ab class. - thankfully, outside forces stopped me from fulfilling that plan: spinning rocked (the instructor had some ltfl happening and it was fun and extremely sweaty) but&nbsp;no one else happened to be there for pump. so i rode home. which was already hard enough. what's wrong with me and my head that i get so over the top with, so stressed out about something that is -above all- supposed to make me feel good?oh well.   so what's been strange these past days?   i'm alone at home. over the weekend, dirk decided it was time to leave town for a while, so he had his bike checked out, bought some padded pants, packed his bike bags and headed off very early monday morning.he called tuesday night, from somewhere south of zürich, which was a bit surprising (but not really) because he had wanted to ride along the rhine to lake constance and back through the black forest. so now he's in switzerland and won't be back till next week, when his friend tammy from canada visits. she travelled with dirk and kolja and a bunch of other people through australia a few years ago, and they haven't seen since. once she's here, dirk will go travelling with her and possibly michi, too, for a little while. i won't come along: i have no funds and should be studying anyway.  afterwards, dirk and i want to go away for a few days, too, not that i know how i am supposed to finance that. maybe we'll just go hiking for a few days.   what's so odd about him being away is that it's like the closing bell to our time together. sure, it's still quite a few weeks until he leaves the city, but it just seems like he is as good as gone now.  he has already terminated the lease of the downstairs flat and the letter from the school he has applied to, near berlin, could arrive any day. once that has happened, i have little doubts that he will move away, too. he keeps saying that he is not sure yet whether he will indeed go away, but if they accept him, i think he will go. the semester starts in late september, he needs to find a place to stay there, he needs to register as a student, take all his stuff up north to his mom's place... so yeah. once he's back, and once we've gone on our little trip, we won't have much time left together.   it feels like our relationship has a "best before" date stamped on its bottom.   it makes me feel helpless. and worthless. and unsure. and sad.   another ldr? right now, i can't really see myself doing that kind of thing again. i have more than 5 years ldr experience, after all, and it's been so much better to actually have a relationship for a change, a real one, right here. i guess i could do it again if it was for a short period of time, if the relationship featured a strong element of perspective. - what that means for dirk and me, i know.i also know what starting uni is like, i know dirk and how he communicates through phones and such, and i wonder whether it could ever work at all.   i have no idea about what i, what we should do.  and that's all i want to write about this right now, really, because there's so much more to say, so much more to think about.  &nbsp;   "remember to remember me   standing still in your past   floating fast like a hummingbird"  "hummingbird"  ~wilco~

      the latest rammstein video almost made me physically sick this morning.   it's awful in it's imagery, awful in its darkness and aggression, but above all, i made the mistake of listening to the lyrics.   i saw an interview with them this week, in which they explained that their new single  "mein teil"  was about armin mewes, the rotenburg cannibal.  armin mewes searched and found a man through the net that wanted to be eaten by him. he found someone, a man from berlin&nbsp;called bernd brandes, and they carefully drafted a plan that would incorporate both their desires. that plan involved the cutting off, frying and eating of bernd brandes' penis, while he was still alive. unfortunately, penis apparently doesn't cook as well or taste as good as the two of them had imagined. how sad is it, if you end your live for the fulfillment of a fantasy that doesn't work out as planned in the end? can we utter a collective "duh!"? wouldn't this make a good verse for a new version of alanis morissettes "ironic"?  the details of what happened in mewes huge estate are mindboogling, and i honestly regret that i ended up reading that&nbsp;20 page report full of details (straight from mewes mouth) in stern magazine sometime last year. it was a whole lot like reading american psycho, which i regret reading, at least somewhat. i wish i had never read that scene with the rat. hell, i wish i hadn't read about that biting of labia scene either. but i have. however, that was fiction, and what mewes did with brandes was real life. he videotaped the whole thing and mewes wasn't found out until more than a year later.above all, the whole cases raises many legal and ethical questions; mewes trial (which ended with a guilty conviction, and an eight year sentence) was controversial. was it murder? was it assisted suicide? his "victim" wanted to be eaten, after all. can you actually consent into being eaten or does the legal concept of the inailenable dignitiy our basic law assigns everyone make this impossible?   in their interview with mtv, the charming members of rammstein gave their position on that issue.   after all, they said, brandes offering himself to mewes and being eaten by him was an act of love, of friendship. bernd brandes wanted to be eaten by armin mewes. the average pig, the average cow, they said, doesn't even get asked.   good point, that one. one for veganism, i'd say. not a good point for allowing consent into being eaten though.

      it's how i have fun these days.    urlLink gerolsteiner  has an ad that runs in the middle of zdf's tour coverage. it features everyday people riding on everyday bikes, being given bottles of water and cheered by the  urlLink gerolsteiner team . they run next to those everyday riders shouting  "allez! allez! allez!"      the ad perfectly illustrates what i call "le tour for loosers" or ltfl: riding your bike and feeling like you're part of the peloton of the grand boucle. - even though you are -quite obviously- not riding 200km a day for three weeks in a row, not riding in the alps, and not really as much into torturing yourself as the folks who actually do ride in the tour: you're just on your way to the supermarket or the gym or at a spinning class.   last week, i went to my first spinning class in months. - somewhere along the line i must have forgotten how much i enjoy it. - otherwise, i can't really understand why i haven't been to one in so long. it's the perfect cardio for me, cycling. it's the perfect way to move.  sure, i've been riding quite a bit on my own heavy, boring, old trekking bike, but that just ain't anything but getting from a to b, even if i do ride fast and furious (i usually kick big gears: i've got big thighs, they like big gears. i'm like jan ullrich, he.). my everyday riding surely isn't as fun, as taxing, as endorphine-high laden as spinning. how do i love thee? let me count the ways...   i went on wednesday morning, to a class by aline. she isn't one of my fave instructors: her classes are usually quite boring, and her spinning classes are no exception. however:&nbsp; who needs an instructor when you've got the "le tour for loosers" concept?   good instructors sneak "ltfl" into their teaching during spinning. they tell you that you're a domestique fetching water for the captain, so you have to cycle extra hard, all alone while the rest of the class just spins. they tell you just how the road feels below your wheels. they make up road chases and split the class into competing teams. they turn the whole thing into a communicative, fun, imaginative, sweaty hour.  aline doesn't do any of that: she changes the songs, yes, and they are good songs, too, she tells you what you're supposed to do, but she doesn't actually "instruct" or "guide" the class. duh. i wonder how she ever got her spinning certificate.   it didn't matter much last wednesday, that she's such a lousy instructor. i have "le tour for loosers", after all. i can guide myself.   it's easy, too.  when cycling, imagine tour scenes.long chases through quaint little villages. break-aways. mountain descends. sunflower field. heat. rain. your team in front, leading, like le train bleu. the colors of the peloton. the fans. classic tour stages, tour city, team time trials and classic tour mountains, the tourmalet, the col de la madeleine, mont ventoux.  at the end of class, during the final climb, i pictured myself riding up l'alpe d'huez, people cheering  "allez! allez! allez!",  my name on the road, the 21 switchback turns, the blue aquarel gates giving the distance left to run, didi senfft as the devil at the red flag, the whole deal. it was fun. so much fun.   "le tour for loosers" works outside of spinning classes, too.   it works every time you're riding a bike.  use it when chasing green lights, telling yourself that you're a sprinter, needing just a few more points at that time point (the traffic light) to get you into the green jersey. if you're a pro at ltfl, for added difficulty, imagine that you have to stay away from robbie mcewen's elbows. imagine that that person riding behind you is robbie mcewen.   use climbs, no matter how tiny, to the max: get out of your saddle, swing the bike, imagine you're on mont ventoux, being chased by pantani in his best days.   enjoy the turns. on the way to my gym, i ride through a park that has some nice ones, plus a little tunnel followed by a tiny little ascend: it's the best part of my way to the gym.   and well, above all: race.   other people in this bike crazy city have doubtlessy discovered ltfl, too: at traffic lights, there is always a race. always. the pensioners with their 2000 mtbs, tight biking shorts and  urlLink "black forest ultra"  bags on their backs are the&nbsp;worst: they are unbeatable. they are the lance armstrongs of ltfl traffic light races.  you can not pass them, ever, and if, by some strange little twist of fate, you do, they chase after you until they lead again at the next traffic light. they are like eddie merckx, lots of little cannibals, who want to stand at the next red light before you do. there is so much aggression in those little races between the red lights on basler landstrasse that i don't think the tension between ullrich, klöden, basso and armstrong on the last 500m up to villard de lans yesterday was much different.   le tour for loosers.  next stage: tonight. i'm going to another spinning class. beware.  and yes, chances are, it will be  urlLink a mountain time trial . what else could it be?   :)

       "took all week for the feeling to come    dry your eyes we're staring at the sun    want to calli've got nothing to say    want it all    got a line and the nerve to stay    &nbsp;  you're keeping secrets, there's only one i need to find     shaking myself from the hum of the morning    saving it all for the rest of the night    losing myself to the drug of the city lights     you're keeping secrets, there's only one i need to find     said it all now there's no mystery    talked so much i forced myself to breathe    underhand but it all went to plan    sold my soul to an understanding man     stayed up all night for the kids    it's getting better     you're keeping secrets, there's only one i need to find"   "keeping secrets"  ~motor ace~      i've got motor ace induced flashbacks.   i met up with thomas last week; he is one of the swiss blokes i met at the something for kate concert last month.  chatting at the concert, we realised that not only do we both live in freiburg, but we also share that little obsession with australian indie music. so we've started swapping cds for some cd burnage that is, of course, covered by §53 urhg.  *cough*   thomas borrowed 7 gems from my cd collection, a collection he took the appropriate time to praise, by the way (way to my heart? tell me that i've got good musical taste  "for a girl",  and in return i got to borrow motor ace.   motor ace ain't good music, you know.  it's mainstream radio guitar pseudo indie pop rock: it's not overly original. but it's fun.   i can't remember when "keeping secrets" was in the charts. - it was during one of my visits in 2002, the song was on the radio lots and i liked it, in all its blantness and sing-a-long-compatibility. in fact i sang along all the time.  i always sing along anyway, to almost any music. i sing badly, too.  some of the happiest memories i have of being with evan involve singing u2. the two of us in my room in rothenburg ob der tauber, working on our costumes for a dress-up party that night, singing the songs from "achtung baby", with no cd top back us up, making up all the instruments, too, and having the songs in correct oder as well. driving in the mg to geelong, top down, u2's "best of" (or anything by them, really) on the mp3 player, both of us singing along at the top of our lungs.   it was on the day that i flew home, i think, that evan and i were at jb hifi in east keilor, and i longingly stood in front of motor ace's "shoot this" cd.   alas, i wasn't allowed to buy it: evan hated it.   he carefully guarded my muscial consumption, and he did so well, introducing me to many of my favourite bands. i am thankful for that.had it not been for him, i quite likely would get fewer compliments for my cd collection these days.   evan disliked motor ace a lot.  he would sing along to it in the most ridiculous way when i was singing along to it on the radio.  he would over-emphasize the singer's strange little brit pop inspired aussie accent when singing along, sounding over the top and hilarious.  "yoo'rre keaeaping seacrets theare's only one i neeed to faaaaaaaaaiind" .   so i didn't buy motor ace then. and didn't on my next trip. one time, when i was back here in germany i longed for it so much that i sat at my computer and kept listening to a 30 second bit of "keeping secrets" at amazon or some other website.but i still didn't buy it, didn't download it illegally from somewhere knowing evan hated it. i wasn't supposed to like this music, you know?   but now i have the cd in my hands.  the first song i turned on thursday afternoon, just as thomas had left, was -of course-  "keeping secrets" . i turned the volume up, and sang along.  it's been fun, and cool, and everything, to finally have this music, as lousy as it is. there's one downside to it though: i keep hearing evan's weird little rendition of the chorus in my head when listening to the song.   motor ace flashbacks.  duh.

      how non-subtle is it, that  urlLink zdf  uses  urlLink a song  by  urlLink sheryl crow  for their tour de france coverage?  i'll take it as an indication that they too believe, just like me, despite all german patriotism, that lance will wear the yo-yo in paris in two weeks and two days.  it's been a strange few days: they are busy and stressful and full of thought and exercise and watching the tour in between. just discovered the  urlLink tdf 2003 blog  today by the way. hmmm. i've got my cartel exam tomorrow afternoon, which i will write in the lunch break of the licensing agreement/contracts in ip workshop i will participate in friday and saturday. should be both interesting and fun: i like licensing agreements, r&d agreements and confidentiality agreements and everything ip contract really. blessed be my first melbourne law firm.  on the upside, i've been socialising a bit, too. my motivation is a bit odd, i admit, but with dirk's impending departure to go to school at the other end of the country, it's time to work on my social net and not spend the evenings in cuddly coupledom in front of the telly. - i've been meaning to improve my social net for years, and now is a good time to start, really. i met two of the girls from the seminar for coffee, and that was good. nadia is an awful lot like me, and that's funky: we both find it hard to study, both have been in ldrs, both like the tour, both talk more than regular people. i'm hopeful. it's a little bit like falling in love, this wanting to have a friendship thing. last night, i took a break from the sitting at home and studying and went out for dinner with my physio, chris. he smsed me in the afternoon, something i had kinda expected ever since i left my mobile number on the office answering machine to set up some appointments on tuesday. very funny, and oh-so-unprofessional! he. so we went on a non-date last night - both of us being partnered and all. it was an evening of really good conversation (from the tour to veganism to physio to yoga to law to physio to love), and i realised how much i long for a bloke to hang out with and talk. i like male perspective on things from males that are not my partner, and i'ev always had good male blokes until recently. there's this potential here, i think: bloke-buddy-potential. and that's a lot. i got to see his flat, too, which was spacious and excitingly tidy and lovely and gave me a bad case of instantflatenvy. he lives in one of the 1900s mansions in a cool part of the city, freshly renovated, wooden floors, a pretty bathroom with a round glass shower and a giant balcony facing south. duh. sitting out there last night, drinking red wine was a good distraction to everything that's been upsetting me these past days.  so yeah. no we've got rainstorms and hail and thunder and lightning. perfect weather for a few more hours of cramming cartel law into my brain.  off i go.  ---------------------- i support  urlLink fleshbots  stand on the  urlLink war on pornography . googlebomb galore!

       ...they don't go to heaven where the angels fly  (snarled by kurt cobain, in that unplugged session)  let's talk about pest control.  i don't know what's wrong with my garden this summer. maybe summer is to blame, the summer that is absent, that is. i've never had a bug problem on my balcony before, but this year, this-it's-20°C-in-july-summer i do. do aphids like cool wet days? i don't know. but i've got the impression that they do.  i thought polyculturing would help prevent bug pests. i thought herbs and strongly smelling plants would help prevent bug pests. my balcony is a miracle of diversity. my balcony is full of wonderful smells. it's a lovely place created with the intent of making it a nice place to hang around for bees and bumblebees and those weird colibri-type little flying things that used to live in the mediterraenean until last years' super hot summer convinced them that freiburg is a cool place to live, too. they like my balcony, too. one of them is visiting several times a day. his name is kolja. or so we think.  so let's take a look at my balcony. jasmine. osteospermums in various shades of violet. heliotrope. fat hen. lavender. goethe, my ginkgo biloba tree (only 25cm tall yet). violet phlox. lobelia. stone flowers. geraniums in pink, white, red and rose. a banana tree. a marguerite tree. olli, the oleander, growing leaves gain even though he nearly died from drought in his winter quatier in the hallway. white sweet peas that have found their way to the gutter. sunflowers and poppy (still tiny). my four cacti live out there, too. in the herb section, there is vietnamese coriander, thyme, basil, rosemary and lemon balm. there used to be mint. - the aphids invaded it so thoroughly, that i simply could not see myself ever eat from it ever again.  it's been a few weeks since the aphids first turned up. the sweet peas were still tiny, i had just re-potted them for the second time, and one morning, when i marvelled at their growth and beauty, there they were, the little buggers, eating away at my beloved self-grown little sweetpeas. the marguerite tree had them, too. the mint was covered as well. and my pots of basil, grown from organic seeds turned out to have some as well. those fuckers. it was a bit like d-day. just without the snipers waiting at the coast. it was a sunday morning, no regular shops were open, the drugstore at the train station did not stock any bug remedies, and so all i could do was cut off the worst affected sections of the marguerite tree, spray the plants with water to no avail (no supersoaker in sight), and  hardly look at them all day, because everywhere i looked, there were aphids. or at least so it seemed. the next morning, as soon as the shops were open, i bought some eco-friendly bug killer: rape oil solution in a handy spray bottle. gentle on ladybugs and bees and all the other friendly things. it gave my sweet peas genetically damaged leaves, turned some aphids brown, crunchy and dead, but did not cause the genocide i longed for. not that i really longed for an aphid genocide, that is. i hate killing things. even aphids. no matter what other people might say though. one of those "other people" could be evan, who would have a few stories about me and bugs, me and spiders (all poisonous, of course, this was australia), me and roaches on toothbrushes. he would however, quite likely tell the following little story about me and ants.  on my first visit to australia, in the winter of 2000, his family had, as during many winters, a bit of an ant issue in the kitchen and bathroom. we're talking of a whole lot of an ant issue, actually, at least from my western european perspective. ants that would greet me from inside the kitchen cupboard, from inside the sugar jar when i got myself a cup of tea. ants that would sit on the toilet seat welcoming me when i wanted to pee in the middle of the night. ants that would hurry away when i turned on the water in the shower (or did they hate to look at me naked?). evans mom, a truly lovely woman, far less ocd with household chores than me, hated the ants, but hated using poison in the kitchen (a stand which i share wholeheartedly). because she had had that ant issue several times before, she knew the issue was going to pass, sprayed some poison here and there and wiped the ants away with kitchen paper on the kitchen counter. one weekend morning, when i had enough of having ants in my tea, ants in the shower, ants on the toilet, i went on an ant mission. first in the kitchen, wiping them away, everywhere, wiping the kitchen cupboards, taking out the trash in which they loved to spend their time. then i went on a mission in the bathroom. i investigated. i checked the trails. i realised that there were holes in the sides of floorboards which could be easy entryways. and then i sprayed. and sprayed, and sprayed some more poison. even though there were not enough ants to justify all that spraying. it was, i must admit, quite a satisfying experience. not because of the killing: there was hardly any killing, there were no ants, just their trails. it was because i was  doing something . when i came back from my mission, the bathroom out of order for a while because of the poison, evan made a whole lot of comments about germans. germans using gas made by bayer. and comitting genocide. and loving it. oh, yes, that's what he did. and that's why he would tell the story if you asked him.  my approach was a good one though. the next morning, there were many, many, many dead ants all around the places where i had sprayed. i felt a bit sad, actually, imagining how the poor little ants would arrive at night, entering the bathroom through the holes in the floorboards, dying when they encountered that nasty residue of baycol. or whatever it was.  anyway. that's the little "caro and ants" story evan would tell if you asked him about me and killing bugs.  despite what that baycol bathroom ant incident might look like, i really don't like killing things. i enjoyed that bathroom massacre because i was doing something against something that annoyed me. - not because i liked the killing. i hate killing insects, plants, anything. i just try to somehow justify it when it concerns tiny spineless things that eat my plants, but even then i suffer because it just doesn't fit with the non-violence approach to life i deem best. but what way should you go? poison is bad for the environment, but at least it works fast. eco friendly methods, like the rape oil against the aphids, are healthier for big animals like humans, but far harsher for the bugs, i reckon. over the winter, dirks large palmtree (lovingly called "olga") began to be the home to tiny fruit fly type flies. not wanting to spray anything, i bought yellow pheromone stickers to attract the flies, and fucking hell, it worked well in attracting flies. way too well, actually: the yellow things would be blackened by tiny bodies within a day or two. to my horror, it would take hours until the flies would die. hours of pain, i am sure. imagine half your life with your body stuck to sticky slime that smelled like sex. on some days in summer, a group of flies will meet in my room and fly under the lamp. after lots of pondering about what to do, i bought some eco-friendly fly spray, and that stuff kills them by slowly dissolving the chitin in their bodies. eco-friendly? pardon me. i've taken to ask the flies and the bugs to leave before spraying them. i tell them that they are welcome in this world, that i cherish them adn i know they have a purpose in this world, but that i would prefer if they chose another place to live. and then i spray. i'm serious about the asking them to leave thing, actually.  on the osteospermums, i could see darwinism in action, as some snail-like things started eating away at the already partly crunchy aphids and the spider-like mini flies that followed in their trails. so in a perfect world, i would have bought some ladybugs to eat the aphids. - i just realised this week that you can actually do that, and what a costly endeavour it is. a batch of friendly bugs is roughly 20. probably only worth it, if you have a large garden, where they can make a home. not worth it, if your garden is nothing but twentyfive terracotta containers on a balcony in the middle of a city. last weekend, as dirk and i sat on the balcony having breakfast, i actually saw a ladybug, for the first time this summer. i welcomed him warmly, asked him to stay and placed him on the bug infested osteospermums. - he didn't seem to like them much, and walked around the lavender instead.  for the moment, the situation is under control. while partly genetically damaged and lunched and munched on, the sweet peas are happy, and growing and growing and growing and pretty and i love my garden. first thing i do after getting up is opening the balcony door to check how everyone is. during the day, as i do my studying, about once every hour i go outside and admire the garden. dirk and i, we eat our meals out there, too, when the weather is nice. in the evening, i spend some time tending and watering and saying goodnight. i practised yoga out there on sunday, doing the yoga journal "happiness" routine, and doing that around things i have grown, things that are filled with love and energy is just lovely. the now is out there, on my balcony, between my plants, between my flowers. i never thought growing things would be my thing, but it is, and it gets more and more important with every summer. maybe it's my grandpas genes. he was a carpenter and enthusiastic gardener, and bulding things and planting things was his passion. he raised most of his plants himself, inclduing masses of geraniums and roses. and tending roses is a science. most of my memories of him are of him in the garden or the workshop, wearing his blue work apron. he was happy when he was out there, working hard to make the garden beautiful. he is the reason why i plant geraniums every summer: they smell like him.  even though i love my grandpa lots, even though he was a good gardener, i know that even if he hadn't passed away 16 years ago, i wouldn't have approached him with advice on bugs: grandpa was less hesistant with poison. he used herbicides and pesticides, sprayed from a huge yellow tank that he would wear in backpack-style fashion, wearing a breath mask. my brother and i weren't allowed in the garden for the next day or two, to avoid us getting up close and personal with the poisoned plants. if i sprayed pesticides in my garden, i simply couldn't stay away, not for a day, hell, not even for an hour.  hippie? yes.

      and just for the record, to remind myself:  this weeks horoscope from  urlLink freewillastrology :  "I propose that you conduct a radical experiment for the next three weeks. Between now and July 22, try on the theory that life is on your side. Assume that all of creation is conspiring to give you exactly what you need, exactly when you need it. At least once every day, speak these words with passionate sincerity: "I believe that reality is a sublime comedy staged for my education and amusement, and that there is a benevolent conspiracy to liberate me from my ignorance and help transform me into the unique masterpiece I was born to be.""

      i talk lots. always have.  in primary school, each and every report card featured a variaton of  "carolin is an exceptional, bright, diligent student. she is articulate and well spoken. she should, however, learn when to stop talking so that others can voice their views as well."  if you've ever met me in real life, you'll know that the only time i don't talk is when i've just fallen asleep in the middle of conversation. enjoy those precious moments of silence moments after i`ve fallen asleep. they don't last that long: i talk in my sleep, too.  over the last few years though, i've changed. i got depressed and i got quiet. i shut up for a whole year, really, the only place i ever spoke being my online diary at opendiary.com. while it was the place where i talked the most, whined, raved, cried, even there, i fabricated an alternate reality in a way, because reality simply sucked too much.  i'm not depressed anymore, and i don't present an alternate reality in my online writings anymore, but when there are things on my mind, i still stop talking, or at least i say less; a lot less. this blog is living proof: extensive writing, extensive breaks.  most of the time when caro goes quiet, something's up.  and that's the case right now. something's up, and i need to think and deal and figure out what's right and what's wrong and what i should do and what will make me happy in the long run and whether wait and see is a good approach, ever, or not. it's all a bit strange and i just don't feel like writing about all that right now. not just because this is online and public. i'm just very much over creating an alternate reality, so i won't write about things when something entirely different is on my mind. on top of that, i've got a cartel & competition law exam coming up friday, and a workshop on licensing agreements on friday and saturday, which all needs to be well prepared. and  urlLink the tour  is on, too.  should i feel the need to write, i will. today, i don't really, and i haven't this weekend, even though i tried. this week, i'll quite likely be spending time with my law books, watching  urlLink lance  on a bike,getting sweaty and thinking at the gym, and that should be enough for now.  that's a lot of stuff anyway, isn't it?   sidenote:   urlLink greece won , which rocks, rocks, rocks.  it makes me wonder though, whether the olympics will happen in 40 days time. they'll be partying so hard that they'll never finish those leftover stadiums or rehearse the opening ceremony. he.  also:  urlLink what happens at the iraq sovereignity party? - you tell your guest they are in charge, but they can't drink without permission."

      i'm tired. tired. tired. it's this having a life thing, you know?  i'm alone at home again on this monday morning, and it's good to be alone. i've got quite a lot to do today (trip to the laundromat, shopping, studying, working out), quite a lot to do this week (studying), but in an effort to not get too stressed out too early in this 32°C day, i think sitting down and writing is a good thing to do for now.  it's been a nice few days, these past ones. last wednesday, tammy arrived from canada. dirk met her in australia in 2001; she joined kolja, sebastian and dirk in their van, they later picked up ullrich, and they travelled through western australia for a few weeks. you know how sometimes when you meet people that you've travelled with, you don't have anything to tell them because all that ever connected you were your travels? for dirk, seeing tammy again has been anything but that. the two of them have gotten along as well as back then (i'd guess), and i've enjoyed her stay as well. she has been a lovely houseguest, the most easy going and easy to please i've ever had, and her stay has been the much needed mini-holiday i've been longing for.  they've been busy in a highly relaxed way, these past days. there's been lots of going places, lots of hanging around, lots of talking, lots of fun. tammy got an extended version of the obligatory city tour: she was appropriately impressed. the city made quite an effort to show itself from its best side: constant sunshine and bright blue skies made everything look even more cute and lovely than it already does anyway. we climbed up the spire of the cathedral, walked through the little streets, hung out on augustinerplatz, chilled in cafes. thursday night, we met up with michi to watch fahrenheit 9/11. on friday, we took the train out to schluchsee and hung out and swam all afternoon, a nice wind making the sun bearable, the place thankfully emptier than i have ever seen it. very relaxing, indeed. friday night we went to a reggae party at susi that michi had organised, where we danced and drank cocktails till 4am, ogling pretty people, being amused by all those very blonde, very european girls trying oh-so-hard to be african queens by having blonde dreads and smooching rastamen. we rode our bikes home at 4am, in a warm night, under a full moon. tammy was lovely company at the party, we laughed lots about the same things, ogled the same boys and danced: i could do with someone like her around at all times. she's smart and interesting, she likes her challenging job with autistic kids and she's relaxed and easy going and fun to have around. we got along really well. when she left yesterday, i told her that she should move here. i meant it, yes.  after way too little sleep, i spend saturday alone in bühl, watching the lukchallenge time trial 2, and with it lance armstrong, george hincapie, jens voigt, thomas voeckler, bobby julich, uwe peschel, michael rich, christophe moreau, patrick sinkewitz and other elite riders. it was cool to see the race, but quite a harsh difference to last weeks tour experience. the audience was primarily german, and hence neither interactive nor enthusiastic. there was almost no serious cheering (there was no way to get an aussie-aussie-aussie-oy-oy-oy cheer going for michael rogers), there was no serious fun and i didn't stand next to anyone willing to chat. it got a bit boring and lonely at times, indeed. many spectators weren't real cycling enthusiasts, either, so i felt a little freakish, being surrounded by people who didn't even know why didi senfft was running around in that devils costume, and who knew none of the riders and kept confusing the teams. the spot that i was standing at was good though: it was right near the starting ramp, with good views of stage for the team and prize presentation, right near the starting ramp. for the actual race however, it was anything but an ideal place: located pretty much in the middle of a straight 4km part of the track, the teams raced by at more than 50kmh. yeah. that much for good middle of the race photo ops.  overall, it was worth it, though. i saw lance, after all, from up close, too, while sheryl crow was sitting in an usps car happily looking on as lance and george hincapie waited for their start. that was cool, of course. not so cool was the fact that the organisation played sheryl crow songs as the lance and george were waiting for their start. very non-subtle. marcel wüst commented the entire race, close to where i was standing, so he offered a good distraction as well. so the trip to the race was good, a sunny day by another roadside seeing people excel in an exciting sport. it was so good to see jens voigt and bobby julich win: i am sure it was good for voigt to get the appreciation after the bad experience riding up l'alpe d'huez when enraged ullrich friends kept shouting "judas" at him, because he had chased ullrich down the day before to protect his teammate basso. the only downside really was the loneliness. oh, and yes, there are  urlLink photos .  saturday night, when i came home after the sunfilled day at the race, i was wiped out and tired, so all dirk, tammy and i did was some more hanging out, a cheapo laubfrosch pizza on the banks of the dreisam, and walking up schlossberg to sit and talk and drink red wine and look at the moon and the fireworks over seepark. i fell into bed soon after that, while dirk and tammy went on to party at grether ost (mainly because juff was there, who tammy instantly liked at the reggae party) where they hung out till 4am once more.  sunday was supposed to be travel day for dirk and tammy. dirk had discussed with michi that it would be cool to roadtrip with tammy to lake constance, to neuschwanstein near füssen and then on to munich, from where she wants to head to hungary to meet family. michi wanted to head to his bavarian hometown for some three day beer-fest this week anyway, going past lake constance for a music festival where one of his friends is working. yesterday morning, it all got me quite upset. for the past days, ever since tammys arrival, really (ever since realising how lovely she is) i've been wanting to come along to the first leg of the trip. lake constance isn't that far away, and i thought it would be cool to hang out for an afternoon, go to that festival, camp and/or sleep outside and head home by train the next day. sounds good, eh? a little too good, maybe? yeah.  being underslept and underfed sunday morning, i got mightily stressed out. i really wanted to roadtrip with tammy and dirk, but felt like i didn't deserve even one more day of holidays because i pretty much didn't work at all last week. i got stressed and sad (as can happy easily when i'm underfed and underslept), i got into that old familiar depressed headspace about not deserving this and cried and couldn't make up my mind. after an hour of teeth gnashing, i finally decided that i would come along and that i would feel good about it and enjoy myself. if not now, when? exactly.  however, as i am obviously here in freiburg this monday, so something mustn't have worked out, right? right.  the plan had been to leave midday. like 1pm or 2pm. dirk, tammy and i were all packed up and ready to go by then. so we waited. and waited. and waited. and waited some more. then it was 3pm. dirk called michi, who said it was going to be another hour. it was 3:30pm. it was 4pm. it was 4:30pm. the overall mood started to sink quite dramatically. especially mine. i called michi and he got all pissed and said he'd come when he was ready. we waited some more. i got annoyed. and then i realised that by that time, it just wasn't going to be worth it for me to come along.  the drive down to lake constance takes about 3 hours. there wouldn't be any swimming that afternoon. i'd be annoyed by michi (as i have been for his lateness many a times). it wasn't going to be worth to roadtrip to lake constance just to sit in a car with tammy and dirk for three hours with a pissed off michi and to go to a concert i wasn't interested in. hell, even if we had camped out at the lake in niederrimsingen (30 minutes from here), where we've camped last year, i would have deemed anything past 5pm way too late to leave. why is it so hard to get ready to go somwhere at a time that it makes sense?  michis lateness annoyed me in so many ways. it stands for so many things. i knew that if i needed a lift to the train station the next day, i surely wouldn't get it from him.  and so it dawned on me that it just would not be right for me to come along after all. why roadtrip stressfully? i'd rather not roadtrip at all. it was a sad realisation, for me and dirk and i guess for tammy as well, who kept asking whether i couldn't organise to stay for two days, but i really couldn't and didn't want to. i felt a bit like a drama queen for changing my mind. but then, i was still tired, still stressed. why risk dragging all that into the week by going on a hasty roadtrip that would not include the things that i had expected from it? by 5pm, tammy, dirk and i went to the downstairs cafe to have some beers to spice up the waiting. two beers later, michi had decided it was time to go and turned up. it was 6pm by then. i said goodbye to dirk and tammy, i felt just a little sad about staying behind, walked home, bought myself dinner, watched the telly for a while and went to bed super early.  so this was the roadtrip that wasn't supposed to be. and i'm alright with it, happy that i am at home today, not already sitting on a train tripping back to freiburg in this heat, worrying about everything i got to do today and this week.  so that's what life has been like this past week: full and fulfilling and good.  now it's time to get some things done. got so much more to write/think/say, and will, soon.
