        urlLink State firefighters rejected air drop request for Cedar Fire because of night regulations : SAN DIEGO (AP) --  The first helicopter pilot to see the patch of flames that would become the catastrophic Cedar Fire radioed for aerial water drops, but state firefighters rejected his request because it came minutes after such flights had been grounded for the night. Within hours, the flames cascaded out of control and killed 13 residents between the mountains east of San Diego and the city. It eventually became the largest wildfire in California history.   Boy, I am glad those regulations are on the books.  If you read the article, the cut off was 5:36 pm!  That is night time in SoCal?  The sun doesn't even set until after 6.  But, I digress, as fires can only happen in the ten hours of bright daylight, and never, ever happen during the fourteen hours of twilight, evening, dusk and dawn.  This is one of those stupid union rules, and is absolutely ridiculous.

        urlLink Denver Post :  Dean declared himself a 'metrosexual,' the buzz phrase for straight men in touch with their feminine sides, as he touted his accomplishments in 'equal justice' for gay and lesbian couples. But then he waffled.  'I'm a square,' Dean declared, after professing his metrosexuality to a Boulder breakfast audience with an anecdote about being called handsome by a gay man. 'I like (rapper) Wyclef Jean and everybody thinks I'm very hip, but I am really a square, as my kids will tell you. I don't even get to watch television. I've heard the term (metrosexual), but I don't know what it means.'   Well, chalk this up to life imatating South Park.  The season premier of South Park had the gang looking just like the characters in "Queer Eye for the Streight Guy".  Being a metrosexual is the hot thing I suppose... I will stick to drinking beer and expressing my masculanity in the traditional means.  The most unusual thing about the metrosexual expierence is that is offends the Gay community.  I guess they can't tell so easily if one is flaming or streight.

        urlLink Napster.com   Well, Napster is back... Well, the cat is back at least.  Now you can get your album of music off of Napster for ten bucks, or singles for one dollar.  I guess this is just iTunes repackaged.  This brings us to last nights episode of South Park.  One of the great lines was something like"Downloading music will subject musicians to semi-luxurious living"  The whole point was that musicians should be happy people are enjoying their music and buying tickets to see live shows.  Just something to think about, again.

Consumers spent with abandon and businesses ramped up investment, compelling new evidence of an economic resurgence.   Yes friends, we are in the midst of a "Bush Reccesion."  Something stikes me as odd though; this is the best economic expansion since Ronald Regan was president.  I suppose student hasn't surpassed teacher just yet.

Approximatly 2201; but the date seems to leave some doubt as the Architect mentioned that zion had been destroyed five previous times; considering that each Zion would have to have a 100 year lifespan; this would put the matrix as really setting in 2701; a point that would not contradict the storyline.  Oh, btw, I am going to see the new Martix: Revolutions today.  Yeah me!

         href="http://www.tallahassee.com/mld/democrat/7181952.htm?template=contentModules/printstory.jsp">Howard Dean campaigns in Tallahassee : Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean told a Tallahassee audience today that southerners have to quit basing their votes on 'race, guns, God and gays.   Does Howard Dean really want to be president?  First, he spouts some crap about how the Democrats need to cater to confederate flag waving white trash in the south, and now he says this crap.  Note to Dean campaign.  I live in Atlanta.  The south is not white trash waving rebel flags and burning crosses.  Atlanta is the only major city ADDING jobs in this "jobless economic recovery"  Maybe these flag waving white trash we have running the place know a thing or two about how to run a state, and you need to take some notes.

       I heard this song on the XM radio this afternoon.  Not only do I not like the song... it actually made me pissed.   urlLink Here is a link to the lyrics... follow along.   This is a response to the Eamon song (F**k it) about an ex-girlfriend who messed around on him.  It is a well written song with some good emotion, quite the rarity in modern urban music.  Anyways, the Frankee track FYRB is a female respnse to his track.  The key lyric that pisses me off is "F**k what I did was your fault somehow"  Let's anylize this for a brief second.  If we look at the two songs to see what they agree on, the woman cheated on the man with one of the man's friend.  The man was upset and refused to take the woman back.  Frankee's response to this, as versed in the song, was that it was the man's fault she cheated on him.  In the quoted line above, she is ambigious... it is simply his fault she sucked some dick.  In the later verses, she goes on to explain that the sex wasn't up to par (in more choice words).  So, the question I pose for everyone... Is the reason "The sex isn't as good as I want"  a fair and approrpiate reason to cheat on your significant other... and further more blame your infidelity on your significant other?  I would answer absolutly not.  It is one thing to leave your significant other if the sex isn't what you were looking for.  But to cheat on your partner... and further more blame your partner for this is absoulty absurd.  It pisses me off everytime I hear this song.  I had to vent... post comments if you need to vent too.

       Hate to admit this, but I got sucked into Reality TV.  I am looking forward to the Season Finalle of Dream Job (ESPN, 9PM EST) tonight.  My personal favorite to win this is Zach.. he has a great wit and personailty to him.  I really enjoy Maggie's writing and intros, but she isn't quite polished enough for the "big show".  Well, I digress, but this is compelling enough for me to postpone (no I haven't bought TIVO yet) my Soprano's viewing until tomorrow night.

       0-2; 34-26 overall (edited); 27 confirmed losses  Well, Xavier lost a close one to Duke... quite a shame too, I was really pulling for them.  The final four pairings are in... the 5PM game next Saturday is Georgia Tech vs.  Oklahoma State .  The 7:40 game is the  University of Connecticut  vs. Duke.  (team in bold is my selection on my bracket).  Finally, while my bracket reflects the above, I am really pulling for Georgia Tech... Partly local, partly it was a school I wanted to go to when I was younger, and partly because they are the lowest seed.  Remember, they beat UConn in the preseason NIT, and they beat Duke at Cameron Indoor this year.  The victory over Kansas was impressive.

       was checking out some cars to replace the "Gadget Mobile"  First up was 95 Golf... it was a stick... decent mileage...4500.  Second. a 97 Monte Carlo... my Mom drives a 98 MC... however this one had only a 3.1  V6 engine, as opposed to a 3.8 in Mom's car.  This one is going for 3900.  Third, a 97 eclipse.  It is black. but the exterior needed some work.  It  is also going for 3900.  Last up, a 2001 Neon.  Low mileage, 2.2 L engine (iirc) and also 4500.  So weigh in on my choices... anything is better then my current 63 HP.

       2-2; 30-22; 27 losses confirmed  Well, all my losses in the regional semis were predetermined last weekend.  I had four games left to decided, and got all four.  Duke and Kansas won for me today; Xavier pulled the upset over Texas, a huge "victory" for me... (I had North Carolina... whom lost to Xavier).  As posted below, I kinda wanted UAB to pull the upset over Kansas... but now I am truely rooting for Georgia Tech to go to the championship game.  Today, OSU plays St. Joes; and UConn plays Alabama.  I need OSU and UConn to win these games, and for the first time since the first round, I have a chance to go undefeated again for the day.  Tomorrow, I really want Xavier and Georgia Tech to win those games... as Duke is a favorite (and no one picked Xavier to go to the final four) and Georgia Tech is the home team.

(screw up everyone elses bracket).   Good news is Xavier is up by three at the half to Texas... an important upset to balance my horrible bracket with everyone elses.

       Well, I got that new toy (see three posts down).  It is equiped with Windows Media, and can play MP3s.  It also has 802.11b WiFi, and can access my network and internet with ease.  But can it play MP3s off my computer???  The answer is unfortunatly no.  Microsoft really droped the ball on this one, as I can't access supported documents off a supported network, without first copying such documents off the network and on the local device.  Hopefully someone designs something that lets me do this, because, frankly, I find it lame.  Oh, and the more I use a WIN CE device, the more I realize WIN CE > PALM... but iPOD > all.

       3-5; 28-20 overall; 27 losses confirmed  The UAB - UK game was incredible.  Quite exciting; after UAB's win over Washington on Friday, and their win over UK today, I am convienced this is one of the top teams in the country.  Incidently, I had UK out of the tourny the second round... but to Washington.  Illinois beat Cincy... this pisses me off.  I always have the big ten do better then they do; and just to spite me... Illinois picks up a win that I didn't predict.  *grumble*  Oh, and Pitt won the only road game of the tourny, @ Wisconsin... I didn't have that one down either...  Well, I am going to stick to baseball... at least I can predict which home run hitters are on the juice.

       2-6; 25-15 overall; 27 losses confirmed  well, let me disclaim my picks now.  I was drinking at the time... consuming large quantities of adult beverages.  with that said, I frankly had the worst tourny day of my adult life... I lost on the Gonzaga - Nevada game; lost on the Texas Tech - Saint Joe's game; lost on the Manhatten - Wake Forest game; lost on the Stanford - Alabama game; lost on the North Carolina - Texas game; and lost on the Maryland - Syaracuse game.  Oh, and lost two final four teams... now I am sitting in last place in all my pools.  good news... at least UConn is still in it; they are my pick to win the whole thing.

       11-5; 23-9 overall  well, I need to stop picking so many upsets.  There were two upsets on Friday... I picked one of them, I also picked four more upsets that didn't fall my way... I do this every year.  Good calls.. I was 4-0 in 5/12 games... bad calls... I was 1-3 in 8/9 games, and a pitiful 0-4 in 7/10 games.  Also lost three second round games on Friday... it was a horrible friday on the brackets.

       12-4  well, my four losses were 8/9 games and 7/10 games.  I picked the big upset... Manhattan over Florida, but missed the Nevada Upset.  Also picked Arizona, Southern Illinois, and Dayton to pull mild upsets... but to no avail.  One of my bigest problems when I do my bracket is that I pick too many upsets... always wind up losing big or winning big in my pool.  In all my pools, I wind up tied for first in the opening night... always a good feeling.  However, last year I went to bed the first night 16-0, only to have my worst bracket ever.

        urlLink News Link   Terrorists win a key election in Spain tonight, as they frightened enough of the electoriate to vote out the rulling Populist party.  This is a significant development, as it appears the bombings on the eleventh appear to have shifted an entire electorate.  I prey that a similarly well timed terrorist attack in America won't have a similar impact on our electorate.  I can't express the significance of this victory for terror.  They literally stole an election, and most likely put an appeasment party in power.  This is as sad a day for the Spanish Democracy as 11 Mar 2004 is for the Spanish Citizanship.

       The following is long and pointless... skip to end for point.  So, I am doing one of my fellow store managers a favor, and run a couple of items over to his store.  He is having an important inspection tomorrow, and I am just doing my part to help out.  Well, I get there, and notice he is missing some celling tiles.  So, I take it upon myself to fix it... figure no big deal.  Well, I get down to one hole to fill, and this one I got to cut.  So I grab the last tile, and cut it all pretty, to match my hole.  Problem was... I cut it backwards.  Well, here it is ten minutes to five, and a hole in my collegue's celing, and I just ruined the only tile.  So, I get in the "Gadget-mobile" and race down the highway to this comercial place that sells the matching tiles.  Only place in Atlanta, in fact.  Well, they close at five, but fortunatly for me they were still there at ten after (despite my heroic driving, I still was ten minutes late).  Get my tiles, and get back.    Point of the story:  Try to do something nice, and you get stuck with a project.

       I don't typically use the following language.  Unfortunatly, I am simply quoting the democratic presidential canidate, John Kerry.  If you are offended by foul language, discontinue reading, and please vote accordingly.  "Bush f**ked up Afghanistan... Did I expect George Bush to f**k it up as badly as he did... cutting all your f**king legs off at the knees... Where the f**k is he?... scare the living s**t out of me... He has a pig-in-s**t grin on his face, he wanted to get into the s**t... doesn’t play s**t in my book..."   The above was found at johnkerry.com  Hmmn... this sounds presidential. I can just see the speech to the nation after 9/11 II (which is almost a cetainty, especially with Sen. Kerry sitting behind the Lewinski desk). "Ahhe Shit! That pig fucker Bush left us with this fucking mess because of his fucking self important foreign policy. Well, I am just going to fuck the jews. I bet that will keep Mr. Bin Ladin and Mr. Arafat off our ass for a while. This is what we fucking get for the shit we pulled during the Bush administations." I think I am going to opt for the Steady Leadership in Times of Change, as oppsed to John "F'in" Kerry's "Fuck it, Bring it On"

       So, here is the point of the dmvs story.  Y'all heard anything about this socialized medicine?  How it will be great, as it takes the big bad pharmactical companies and HMOs out, and the great govenment will take over.  Well, if you want a picture of what the Emergency Rooms of the future will be like, look no further then the DMV.  First you will wait in a line of people that range from "just wanting a doctors note" to "died waiting"  Finally, when you reach the conclusion of the line, you will be asked what is wrong, and given a number for the appropriate quere.  When your number is finally called, a nurse will diagnose you.  If your self diagnosis was acurate, congradulations, you will be given a number to talk to a doctor.  If your self diagonosis was inacurate, you will be sent to the begining to start all over.  Regardless of your diagonosis, you will be waiting to see the same doctor anyways.  Finally, when you do see a doctor, he is going to do a half ass job, so he can get to the next patient.  And heven forbid you get ill or injured after five... unfortunatly you will have to come back tomorrow.

       Well, I got back to my ass raming at eight this morning.  Call me what you will, but I love to get my shit packed by the DMV.  Well, they open at nine, so I figured, if I get there at eight, I shouldn't have that long a line.  Wrong.  Apparently, this is where those star wars nerds got the idea to camp out a spot in line for the movie.  The line extended to the Alabama border this time, and I promptly took my place.   More waiting to get a ticket to get a ticket to get a ticket bs, but by one, I finally got my license.  The ticket waiting did hit a low, though... when my number was first called, I spoke to this one woman at her window.  Well, she tells me to go get another number so that person can help me.  Well, three hours or so later, my new number is called, and whose window do I get called to?  That's right... hers.  Oh, and they had to print my license like three times before it laminated right; and the picture sucks.  At least I am legal again.

       Today I went in after a half day of work.  I assumed I would have plenty of time to take care of this, arriving just before Lunch.  Well, I wait in this line that wraps around the building.  At the conclusion of the line, some woman that was too unpleasent to get a job in collections esentially asked me "what the hell do you want?"  After sharing with her all my documents, and surviving an interrigation that would keep america safe if only it were implemented by the Department of Homeland Security, I was given a number, and an oppertuntiy to sit down while I wait.  So, about three hours pass, and I finally get called.  My documents are scrutinized even further.  Apparently, they weren't pleased with the choice of stamp that Washington State decieded to use on my Motor Vehicle record.  So unpleased, they attempted to turn me away until I got a new document, to which I responded, "Who am I to tell the State of Washington how they should stamp their official documents."  Well, after a couple of supervisors got off their bueracratic asses to review my papers, I was given another number so I could take my tests.  So I wait another half hour, and then take a quick written test.  Well, it is about 3:45 then, and they stop the drive testing @ 4:30 (convient bankers hours... I suppose to avoid being inconvienced).  Well, finally, I get my test at about twenty past four and manage to pass that as well.  So, back to waiting again, and the dmvs closes at five, about twenty minutes away.  I wait, and wait, and count the seconds, and soon five o'clpck comes.  All the last numbers get called, and finally, I am the only one sitting there.  So, I ask the front desk nazi why my number hasn't been called, and she tells me to ask all the window people.  I ask all the window people and they tell me to ask the front desk nazi.  I ask the front desk nazi again, and she tells me to get a supervisor.  So I ask her for a supervisor, and she sends me to the window people.  So, I go back to the window people, ask for a supervisor, and the supervisor says... "We close at five, you are going to have to come back tomorrow."  The bastards!  I will be back tomorrow.

       Well, many of you know I am a connectivity guru.  I can connect nearly any electronic device to any other electronic device.  Well, I have been faced with a problem.  My roommate promised a cable drop to my room when I moved in back last fall.  Well, I have been paying half the cable bill (and enjoying the internet and cable on the big screen) but still have the ol' rabbit ears in the bedroom.  Not for long, though... as I found  urlLink this .  It is a wireless video transmiter... not new stuff, I have had one for several years.  However, what this one packs is an intergrated RF remote & cable tv tunner.  This esentually means I can have cable tv up in the room w/o droping a cable.  But, it gets better.   Often on a Sunday I want to cook out on the porch, but not miss the game.  Problem no longer... as this bad boy goes portable.  In fact, with a couple of these, I could arm the bathrooms with cable TV... and the hallways.... and the laundry room... and the closet... and the attic.... and the... I am getting a bit carried away, but... this is my thing.   urlLink Device from Angeltrax.com

       Someone get this man some help!  His MPPS is raging out of control.  Throughout this campaign, Kerry has stated that he threw out the medals of other people, but not his own.  However, in 1971, he insisted that he threw out even his Purple Heart.  Here is a quote.     Kerry told a much different story on Viewpoints. Asked about the anti-war veterans who threw their medals away, Kerry said "they decided to give them back to their country."  Kerry was asked if he gave back the Bronze Star, Silver Star and three Purple Hearts he was awarded for combat duty as a Navy lieutenant in Vietnam. "Well, and above that, [I] gave back the others," he said.  The statement directly contradicts Kerry's most recent claims on the disputed subject to the Los Angeles Times last Friday. "I never ever implied that I did it, " Kerry told the newspaper, responding to the question of whether he threw away his medals in protest.    We know he does, in fact, still have the medals.  So, why did he lie about them in '71?  You may be asking yourself why this is important.  Frankly, I could care less about the whereabouts of John Kerry's medals.  However, I do care about the fact that Kerry will flip flop and say whatever people want to hear.  I do care that Kerry will literally take multiple positions on any given subject, simply for political gain.  Don't believe me?  Here is a quote from the article about why Kerry changed his story.   According to a Boston Globe report on April 15, 1984, union officials had expressed uneasiness with Kerry's candidacy because he had thrown his medals away. Kerry acknowledged the medals he threw away were, in fact, another soldier's medals. He reportedly invited a union official home to personally inspect his Silver Star, Bronze Star and three purple hearts, awarded for his combat duty as a Navy lieutenant.   So, to get the Union vote, he revealed that he still had the medals.  But, what did he say he threw out?  The answer depends on when you asked him.  Here is a brief summary.   Year      Kerry answer to question  1971      Threw out his own medals  1984      Didn't throw out medals  1988      Threw out his own ribbons, but no medals  1996      Threw out his own ribbons, but couldn't get home to get the medals to throw them out  2003      Threw out his own ribbons, but because he was proud of his medals, he didn't throw them out.      Threw out the medals of injured solders who couldn't make the protest, but not his own.  2004      Never threw out own medals, nor ever implied he had.   urlLink Here is a link to the story.   It comes from the highly conservative news department of ABC.

       How good is Barry Bonds this year?  Take a look at the following line...  G  AB R  H  2B 3B HR RBI BB SO SB CS BA   OBP  SLG   OPS  16 71 8  27 6  0  4  13  7  9  1  0  .380 .430 .634  1.064   Those are pretty good stats... batting .380, 4 hr, 13 rbis... not too bad.  Too bad those belong to Manny Ramirez.  Here are Barry's numbers in comparison.  G  AB R  H  2B 3B HR RBI BB SO SB CS BA   OBP  SLG   OPS  16 41 17 21 5  0  9  20  27 4  1  0  .512 .706 1.293 1.999  This guy is batting .512!  .512 for crying out loud!  Here are Barry's numbers projected for a course of the season.  G   AB  R   H   2B 3B HR RBI BB  SO SB CS BA    OBP SLG   OPS  152 391 162 200 48 0  86 191 257 38 10 0  .512 .706 1.293 1.999  While I don't believe this guy is going to hit 86 homeruns, it sure puts things into perspective.  Lets assume that the number of walks and at bats have projected accuratetly.  In order for Bonds to hit .400 over the course of the season, he would need to hit .371 for the rest of the season.  .371 isn't unheard of; in fact, Bonds hit .370 in 2002.  Bonds could be in fact making a run at Ted Williams, the last man who hit .400 (.406 to be exact).  He already is third all time on carrer home runs.  He has 6 MVP awards; one NL batting title (.370); single season home run record (73); all time record for walks (2094); and the only man with 500 stolen bases and 500 homeruns.  You can talk about steroids and the whole lot, but in my opinion steroids don't make one more disciplined at the plat.  Steroids don't make batting averages go up.  And steroids certainly don't intentionally walk someone.  Bonds is something else...

       work sucked today... it seemed nothing was going right.  No matter what I did, Murphey was using that stupid law against me.  The service sucked, the kitchen sucked, my managers sucked, it all sucked.  My roommate has this girl friend as of late.  They are still in the first stage of love.... the "Joined at the hips or other near by anatomy."  The way he talks, they are making like bunnies.  She seems like a nice enough girl, so it's all good, I suppose.  Well, the spinnoff of the Sopranos hits New Jersey with the arrival of the Mannings.  That is right, Archie and acting boss Eli suckered the Chargers into the trade.  We should make the All-Whine team.  I can see Eli throwing to T.O.  We might expound on that later.  In fact... I am taking nominations for the All-Whine team.  Post them as comments.  Also, seventeen games into the season, and the Mariners & Giants are 6-11.  WTF!  Barry has more homeruns then the team has wins, for crying out loud!  As for Seattle, they have been so good in April the last few years.  Other sub-500 surpises?  Try the Phillies, Royals, and oh yeah... the team with four major league payrolls... the Yankees.  With the thirty-first pick of the draft, the San Franciso 49ers select Rashaun Woods from Oklahoma State.  Is this T.O. w/o the attitude... or just another sub-par reciever in a draft filled with recievers?  All I can say is that sitting on pick 31 with the team they got in SF is not going to work out.  My gut says this is going to be a five win season near the bay... if we're lucky.  Oh, and in the third round, another wide out.  Tim Rattay is going to have a couple of rookies to throw to.

       No one asked Pat Tillman to serve in the armed forces.  In fact, if anything, they discouraged it.  The Arizona Cardinals were paying him $3.6 million.  He had a newlywed wife at home.  He was in the peak of his career.  At twenty-six, he was too old to join the military anyways.  He had more excuses not to serve then anyone.  Yet, Pat Tillman was touched by 9/11.  Today I heard a clip from the Dan Patrick Show, recorded on 12 September 2001.  Tillman was a guest on that show, and one of the things he mentioned was his debt of gratitude to those who protect this country.     My Great Grandfather was in pearl harbor and alot of my family has given up and has gone and fought in wars and I really haven't done a damn thing as far as laying myself on the line like that, and so I have a great deal of respect for those that have.   Pat Tillman, September 12th 2001.  So, shortly after that tragic day, Tillman joined the Army Rangers.  He and his brother trained at Fort Benning, earning $17,000 a year.  He fought in arid Afghanistan, searching out our enemy, fighting to protect our freedom.  Not only did he give up his millions of dollars, his high standard of living, his football career... last night he gave up his life.  Many of us considered serving our countries after 9/11.   The event shook us as a nation, and changed us.  But none were changed as profoundly as Tillman and his fellow solders that enlisted to serve in the Middle East.  For us, it was lip service... for Tillman and his brothers in arms, it was real sacrifice.  While we bitch at the airline gates, they are helping to rid the world of the threat that caused this.  Courage, Honor, Sacrifice... these are words tossed around the sports page all the time.  However, for the brave men and women who serve our country, these adjectives are simply a way of life.  Let us not forget the hundreds who have volunteered and paid the ultimate sacrifice.  Pat Tillman, dead at 27.    urlLink Story at MyWay.com

       I hadn't updated in a few days... here is what's up.  One, Barry Bonds is the man.  Granted, he has swung and missed 7 (that is right, only seven) times this season.  He is averaging one home run every 6.8 swings this season... not at bats, but swings.  He has nine home runs, is batting .500, and over the last nine games he is 8/19 with 8 homeruns.  All this while playing in the hardest major league ball park to hit homeruns.  Even if he has used steroids, this is incredible.  Two, John Kerry is an idiot.  While I am occasionally disapointed in aspects of the Bush presidency, I am absolutly terrified of a potential Kerry presidency.  For instance, he has said that abortion is a states issue.  Now that he is running for a National Office, however, it suddenly is a federal issue.  This is very tipical of Kerry.  On most issues this man has taken multiple sides.  Does he suffer from multiple personality syndrome?  Some quick research suggests not.  Rather, I believe he suffers from multiple political positions syndrome (MPPS).  MPPS is a disease that plagues the mind with multiple angles and manipulations of policy that are unfathomable to the average man.  Suffers, known as Democrats in most circles, usually are addicted to poll data... often doing anything they can for their next poll fix.  Similar to other addicts, they will do unconconalbe things to feed their adiction.  They have even been known to sell out thier own countries for a spike in the polls.  As public opinion changes, so do the political positions of a suffer of MPPS.  Occasionally, their political postion will completely flip 180 degrees.  When left to themselves, MPPS suffers are harmless to the general population, however... when placed in a leadership postion, those with MPPS can destroy economies, families, and even the constitution.  Please, be mindful of MPPS when you place your ballots this November.  Three, I got gmail, from google.  Since I haven't gotten any e-mail yet there, I really can't tell you much about it, other then, well... it is e-mail.  If you want to send me something there, however, my addy is rick.hendricks   gmail.com.  Four, Greg has a very cool addition to the a-crowd site,  urlLink A-Crowd Productions .

       Read the following story by John Leyden  urlLink right here.    Girl, 15, on child porn rap after posting sex pics online  A 15 year-old American girl has been charged with child pornography offences after posting pictures of herself online.  The unnamed teenager is accused of sending photos of herself "in various states of undress and performing a variety of sexual acts" to people she met in online chat rooms, AP reports. Police found dozens of inappropriate photos when they seized the girl's PC.  The teenager has been charged with the possession and distribution of child pornography as well as the sexual abuse of children.   What I don't seem to understand is the charge of "the sexual abuse of children."  If the pictures are of herself, then what children did she abuse?  By that definition, the fourteen year old boy who discovers self-gratification has enough counts to serve a life sentence.

       Giants 1-0; Bonds 1 HR; 659 overall  Bonds ties it up in the eighth with his 659th career homerun, leaving him one behind his godfather, Willie Mays.  Snow had the winning RBI in the ninth for the Giants first of the season.  It looks like with Bonds closing in on Mays, ESPN2 will be carrying all the G-men's games until Bonds passes Mays.  Guess that makes me happy.

       1-0; 36-27 overall  UConn dominated Tech thru out the game Monday night for their second National Championship.  No one really gave Tech much of a chance against the Huskies, and after seeing the first half, I can understand why.  Frankly, they were owned.  It didn't hurt the Huskies chances that the Yellow Jackets couldn't hit a shot from anywhere on the court.  Well, that ices my bracket, which had already won both pools I participated in.  While I am disapointed that Tech didn't pull it off, I got the consolation prize of knowing that I rock and am a basketball prophet.  It is finished... on to baseball.

       well, despite the fact that The Devil Rays and Yankees have played two games, and the Red Sox and Orioles have played one, the Major League season doesn't start until the first pitch in Cincy. (the Cubbies won that one, btw... and they look really good this year).  The Giants don't play until 7 PM (on espn2), but I am going to have to watch that game on the side.  Baseball rarely gets trumped, but Georgia Tech and UConn are playing tonight @ nine.  On a side note, I decided to invest in the MLB.tv plan... where I can watch the games streaming on my PC.  This is a big deal for me, as I don't get to see too many Giants games in Atlanta.  When looking at the plans, my choices were $14.95 a month; $79.99 a season, or join MSN Premium.  Initially, I was going to go with the $79.99 a season, which figures to $11 a month, however, reading into the MSN Premium, I went with it.  Not only do I get MLB all access, I get Hotmail extra storage, Encarta Premium, and a whole bunch of services I won't ever use.  The part that sold me... $9.99 a month, and three months free.  If I cancel after the end of baseball season, total cost to me will be $49.95.  Sounds like a winner to me.

       One of my favorite traditions is setting the clocks on daylight savings time.  It is quite a novel concept, as the government is telling the whole country (except AZ, HI, and parts of IN) to completly falcify their clocks, and we all listen.  Astronmicaly, daylight savings is simply a ruse to get us to set our clocks incorrectly.  It was established to help save on energy costs, as it forces us as a nation to get up an hour earlier (and go to bed an hour earlier) more alligning our schedules with the long daylight hours of summer.  I guess if Uncle Sam says so, we'll all get up earlier.

       1-1; 35-27 overall  Wow.  First up; Georgia Tech held off Oklahoma State to advance to Monday's Championship game 67-65.  A beautiful lay-up with 1.5 seconds remaining secured the victory for the Yellow Jackets.  Tech led most of the way, but the Oklahoma St clawed back in it toward the end, in fact knotting it up @ 65 with only 29 seconds remaining.  Tech was patient, and Byrum put in the game winner, propelling the Wrambling Wreck to their first NCAA championship game.  As good as the first one was, the second game attempted to out do it.  UConn trailed Duke by 11 toward the close of the game, but managed a timely 12-0 run to win the ball game by one, 79-78.  My bracket has UConn winning the whole thing, so this victory was "expected."  So, on to the championship game.  While I have UConn winning it on the bracket, I have already clinched my two pools, leaving me to root for the home team and underdog Yellow Jackets.  Even if the Huskies win on Monday, an interesting note is that Tech has beat all the final four teams once this year.  Tech beat then Number One UConn during the Preseason NIT semifinals earlier this year, as part of a 12 game winning streak to open the season.  (The went on to win the preason NIT against Texas Tech.)  At 77-61, that game wasn't even close, but the Huskies big man, Emeka Okafor, was suffering with back spasms.

       Multiple Political Positions Syndrome, known on this site as MPPS, continues to afflict Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry.  As US gasoline prices soared as a result of spring OPEC production cuts and summertime domestic demand increases,  urlLink Kerry urged President Bush  to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, our nations emergency oil reserve.  However, this differs greatly from his position in February 2000.   urlLink Drudge Report  has a quote from Kerry stating “A release is not relevant.  It would take months for the oil to get to the market.”  So which is it, Mr. Kerry?

I didn't do the research required to confirm these statistics, but if they are even close to accurate, it really says something about politics.   Can you imagine working for a company that has a little more than 500 employees and has the following statistics: * 29 have been accused of spousal abuse * 7 have been arrested for fraud * 19 have been accused of writing bad checks * 117 have directly or indirectly bankrupted at least 2 businesses * 3 have done time for assault * 71 cannot get a credit card due to bad credit * 14 have been arrested on drug-related charges * 8 have been arrested for shoplifting * 21 are currently defendants in lawsuits * 84 have been arrested for drunk driving in the last year... Can you guess which organization this is?  It's the 535 members of the United States Congress. The same group that crank out hundreds of new laws each year designed to keep the rest of us in line.

       Well, fertiltiy researchers have found one additional cause for couples to be baren... a lack of sexual activities.  A German couple (most likey Lutheran) went to a fertility clinic to inquire why they weren't able to have children.  After much testing, and some questioning, it was found that the cause of thier conception problems was the lack of a manual.  "We are not talking retarded people here, but a couple who were brought up in a religious environment who were simply unaware, after eight years of marriage, of the physical requirements necessary to procreate."  Well, now that they are going to finally do the deed, at least we know their children won't be left in the dark.   urlLink Here is the link to the story.

       Well, I watched Meet the Press this morning, and am pretty convinced that McCain would not participate in a possible Kerry government.  He stated that he essentially would not accept a vice presidential bid from either Bush or Kerry.  He also stated that he is only interested in serving the people of Arizona in the capacity of Senator, and also intends on campaigning for Bush in 2004.  Good for John McCain!

In the mean time, I wanted to highlight some other stories developing.   NBA Playoffs  - I am not a big fan of the NBA, but the second round of the playoffs have been something else.  All four matchups started off 2-2, and some great games have been played.  That Thursday night game between LA and San Antonio will go down as one of the greatest finishes in history, and the Kings/Wolves series has been phenomenal.   Smarty Jones  - Compared to the NBA, horse racing doesn't even register on my radar, but this horse has an incredible story.  And after winning the Peakness by a record eleven lengths, he is prime position to win the Triple Crown.   Fraiser Series Finale  - Well, what can I say.  One of the best shows on television has come to an end.  And, unlike other sitcom endings, it left some mystery at the end, and had a mildly surprising ending.  A great series, and a great ending... at least we have the reruns.  Oh, and in 2006, those reruns will be on Lifetime (blah).

        urlLink Story discused from the NY Times   Every time I read a story about this, I find it so intriguing.  On one hand, I think it would be a genius technique for the Kerry camp to bolster their weakness on National Defense (unfortunately, the key cornerstone of the Bush campaign).  It also appeals to moderates, and the "McCain Voters" from the last presidential cycle.  This would be a great way for the Kerry camp to appeal to ideological conservative who think they are "moderate".  These are the people that get their news from the networks, don't listen to talk radio, have families, are middle to upper middle class, have conservative values, but share an "emotional" appeal with the left.  A Kerry-McCain ticket would have great appeal with this type of voter.  This technique also concerns me heavily.  McCain is a "media darling."  If he were to sign onto the Kerry campaign, it would make the mainstream media orgasmic with delight.  It would be difficult for the Bush camp to label the Kerry camp as liberal.  Words like Bi-Partisan, moderate, and middle would be even more prevalent in the media when it comes to describing Kerry.  If this were an accurate depiction, that would be one thing... however, these adjectives have no place in the same sentence as Kerry.  This depiction of Kerry would be misleading and couldn't be further from the truth.  However, with a McCain vice presidential bid on this ticket, it would in the minds of the left give it legitimacy.  One possible technique I heard described by the media was for Cheney to be dropped from the ticket in an attempt to secure Georgia democratic senator Zell Miller for the vice presidential nomination.  This would be an attractive decision for the campaign, as it minimizes the effects of the McCain selection, as well as rids the Bush campaign from the (unfounded) shouts of Halliburton.  Frankly, Miller is very similar to McCain ideologically... but he carries the Democrat tag.  If elected, however, I would see a Bush-Miller ticket disadvantaged compared to a Bush-Cheney ticket.  Where I am going with all of this speculation is that us conservatives should be concerned of the possibility of a Kerry-McCain ticket.  It would cloud the difference between Bush and Kerry on National Defense (the differences are night and day) and it would mislead the voting electorate into believing Kerry is less liberal then his voting record truly shows.

       Well, I just finished viewing the ten minute preview on FOX for The Day After Tomorrow.  Excluding those who have been hiding under a rock for the last month, everyone has seen something about this movie.  It has been getting an insane amount of press, and ads for it are everywhere but on a  urlLink major league baseball field .  Directed by Roland Emmerich ( Independence Day ), it depicts the catastrophic events caused by greenhouse gas global warming.  Among the images presented, New Delhi is hit with snowstorms, Tokyo is attacked by bowling ball size hail, LA is stricken with multiple tornados, and New York is flooded dramatically.  While I am looking forward to seeing this movie, it is not without reservation.  Here is a brief summation of those.  1)   Why do people think this is fact?  This is a piece of science fiction.  Many news accounts of this film are based on the premise that this movie is a detailed account of the effects of global warming.  This couldn't be farther from the truth.  For one, the premise of global warming is simply a humanistic explanation for the normal changes in the earth's climate.  As anyone who has lived since Adam knows, some days are warmer then others.  This is simply the nature of climate, and has nothing to do with man's influence on the world.  And, even if you find the concept of global warming as scientlificaly accurate, the movie depicts a world that gets colder!  It suggests that global warming could cause an Ice Age.  Daniel Shrag, Harvard University oceanographer, disagrees with this premise.  "The movie exaggerates how quickly climate change can happen. And higher carbon dioxide will not push us into another ice age."  2)  This scenario is impossible  Even if the North Atlantic Gulf Stream were to just stop (an event about as likely as a hurricane to wipe out Nebraska), like it does in the movie, the level of instantaneous catastrophe is still greatly exaggerated.  While it would be permissible for low lying areas, such as Long Island, or the Netherlands, to flood, it could never be as sudden or pronounced as it is in the movie.  It would take decades or centuries for flooding of this magnitude to occur.  The same goes for the tornados in LA.  Certainly, a drastic change in climate could increase the probability of tornados in LA, however, this increase would mostly likely be an additional tornado or two in a decade, not the several simultaneous cyclones depicted in the movie.  Professor Phil Jones, climatologists at the Climate Research Unit, points out the absurdity.  "The... scenario the film portrays is scientifically ludicrous - not only in the speed of response but also by linking sea-level rise to extreme cold."  3)  This movie should not be used for politics  Al Gore, and other environmentalist wackos, have proudly endorsed this movie as Mother Earth's fate if we don't clean our act up.  Gore has utilized this piece of fiction  urlLink political purposes .  This movie supports the premise of global warming as much as the movie Independence Day supports the premise of extra terrestrial life.  We should come away from this movie with as much zeal for protecting the environment as we came away from Independence Day with zeal fro protecting our cities from Aliens.  This movie is less about global warming as it is about the way people respond to catastrophe, and should be seen as such.  Few climate experts find anything plausible about the scenarios laid out in this film.  However,  urlLink Democrats and environmentalists are using it as a two hour political ad .   urlLink Moveon.org said it planned to have thousands of volunteers handing out leaflets about global warming outside theaters when the movie opens.   This type of behavior is deplorable, and is as ludicrous as Republicans using a film like Independence Day as an argument for increased national security.  While this movie appears to be entertaining, and a powerful use of special effects to tell a fascinating story, we should be careful not to be caught up in this work of fiction when it comes to choosing policy or our leaders.  As I have heard hundreds of times before, "It's only a movie."   Quotes were taken from the  urlLink UK Independent  &  urlLink NY Times .

        My old man sent this in a forward.  Rather then forward this to everyone in my book, I figured I would post it for the world to see.  I think this is one of of the better arguments for Bush's foreign policy.  Enjoy, and be educated.   I recently attended the National Pastors Convention in San Diego with several thousand pastors from many different denominations. During one of the general sessions, the Master of Ceremonies introduced a pastor from Uzbekistan. He had traveled the farthest to attend the convention. I don't remember his name, and even if I did, I know I couldn't pronounce it.  However, I do know this: I will never forget this man.  Right away, I liked him. He was humble, sincere, and gracious. He  apologized  for his broken English, though I thought he spoke very well. As the MC interviewed him, he began to share about his ministry in his country that borders Afghanistan. He talked about the church he pastors of a few hundred people. He also shared how it is illegal in  his country to be a Christian. You see, his church is an "underground" church. Amazingly, his city also has 3 "underground" Christian schools.  He talked about how the Christians have been arrested and even killed in his country.  Then, as the interview was about to end, he began  to speak very urgently and passionately. He said something to this effect: "I would like all of you to know that my church and the Christians in my country are praying  that  President Bush will be reelected." I was stunned. I knew that this gathering had to include many pastors from all over the political spectrum and I was certain  this would not go over  well. Immediately, there were murmurings and rumblings throughout the audience and the MC seemed a little uncertain about what to do next.  However, this pastor would not be denied. Grasping the microphone firmly in his hand, he continued, "The officials in my country  are afraid of President Bush, so they don't persecute Christians as much. Under Clinton it was very bad for us. Many of us were arrested, put in jail, and some were killed.  With Clinton, it was very bad. But under President Bush, it  has been so much better, so we are praying for him." The murmuring ended. It was suddenly very quiet. The MC paused. Then he just asked us to stand and pray for this man and we did so with great passion.  Choking back tears, I was immediately struck with  this realization in my  heart: this coming election was not just about me or my church or my country. This coming election would affect the  entire world. And while there are many Christians and churches in this country that may not support our current President, there is a group of Christians halfway around the world who are desperately praying for his reelection.  All of the sudden, the election became something very different for me. It is not just about the economy, gay marriage, or  weapons of mass destruction. It's about the persecuted church around the world. As believers, what issues should be more important to us? This transcends politics.  This is about the Kingdom of God!  For which Christ suffered and died, and for those believers in other countries who are suffering and dying as well. I was also convicted in my heart about praying for our President. And I wonder, which church is praying more fervently for him: the persecuted church in Uzbekistan or the prosperous church in America? It makes you think.  As the Apostle Paul said in Hebrews 13:3, "Remember those in prison as if you were their fellow prisoners, and those who are mistreated as if you yourselves were suffering." Remember, this election is not just about us. It's about them.  James Lair (jlair@ojaiclc.org) Senior Pastor, Church of the Living Christ

       I am quickly becoming addicted to Texas Hold'em Poker... I have been playing alot at Partypoker.com... last night I played my best set of hands yet, bringing in 1800% of my starting funds.  Of course, it is play money... but was still fun.  I am trying my hand on tournements right now... been getting some cold cards.  Also got the Angeltrax wireless cable box hooked up.  It works as well as advertised.  I recommend it to anyone who wants cable somewhere, but doesn't want to bother with the cable run.  Bonds has been out for a couple of days.  His assult on the record books should resume shortly, however.  And, how about the Rocket... he leaves the Yankees, and is 6-0, with a great era and now second on the all time strikeout list.  I love when people take off their pinstripes to be successful.  (Oh, and I am lovin' what the Rangers are doing this year too... some people hate Bonds... I don't care for A-Rod).  Oh, and btw... that single table tourny is up... I wound up in second... which is pretty good since my best hand was a pair of Queens.

       First, I do not post this to belittle Sen. Kerry's service to his country durring Veitnam.  As many would charge, I am not questioning his patriotism.  I would like to tell a story I read from the National Review (unlike the previous Kerry post, this did come from a conservative source).     I have a very clear memory of an incident which occurred while I was the Medical Officer at Naval Support Facility, Cam Ranh Bay.  John Kerry was a (jg), the OinC or skipper of a Swift boat, newly arrived in Vietnam. On the night of December 2, he was on patrol north of Cam Ranh, up near Nha Trang area. The next day he came to sick bay, the medical facility, for treatment of a wound that had occurred that night.  The story he told was different from what his crewmen had to say about that night. According to Kerry, they had been engaged in a fire fight, receiving small arms fire from on shore. He said that his injury resulted from this enemy action.  Some of his crew confided that they did not receive any fire from shore, but that Kerry had fired a mortar round at close range to some rocks on shore. The crewman thought that the injury was caused by a fragment ricocheting from that mortar round when it struck the rocks.  That seemed to fit the injury which I treated.  What I saw was a small piece of metal sticking very superficially in the skin of Kerry's arm. The metal fragment measured about 1 cm. in length and was about 2 or 3 mm in diameter. It certainly did not look like a round from a rifle.  I simply removed the piece of metal by lifting it out of the skin with forceps. I doubt that it penetrated more than 3 or 4 mm. It did not require probing to find it, did not require any anesthesia to remove it, and did not require any sutures to close the wound.  The wound was covered with a bandaid.   Not [sic] other injuries were reported and I do not recall that there was any reported damage to the boat.   Dr. Louis Letson, treating physician of Sen. Kerry's wounds that earned him his first of three purple hearts.   urlLink Byron York's "Kerry Purple Heart Doc Speaks Out" from May 4th National Review Website.

       Well, I found myself working again.  Back at McDonald's, unfortunatly.  The money is good and it is immediate.  It is't my first choice of employers, though... but I still have things in the works with some other companies.  We'll just have to see where I end up.

       Apparently, Lisbon police have found a new method of crowd control.  In the United States, the prefered method is nightsticks and pepper spray (and who can forget the rubber bullets).  Well, in Portugal, they are just getting the crowd stoned.  The crowd just happens to be English soccer fans.  Frankly, their is no less behavied crowd then that.  So, in an effort to mellow them out, they will not be harrased for smoking bud... in fact, it will be encouraged.   Pot-smoking fans have been assured they will not be arrested, cautioned — or even have their drugs confiscated. “Alcohol makes fans fight. But cannabis smokers will be shaking hands and singing along together.”     Here's a  urlLink link to the story.

       So, I haven't posted online in a while... at least anything revealing.  So, here's whats up.  1) I stayed in Washington after my little vacation.  I have a tendency to take a trip out to the Pacific Northwest, and then just stay.  I really need to get that fixed.  2) Jobs... obviously, the commute from Bremerton, WA to Powder Springs, GA was far to great to make on a daily basis, so I resigned from my job.  As for a replacement job, I am in the following quandary.  Currently, I have three possibilities; 1) work for a fast food restaurant I have previous experience for; 2) work for a full service restaurant that I have no experience with; and 3) wait on an interview for a supervisor position with a company I previously worked for.  If all three were offered today, I would pick number 3 in a New York minute; however, number 3 involves sitting and waiting... which keeps my life completely up in the air.  Despite how spontaneous I am, life up in the air = ulcers.  3)  urlLink LanCamp  is starting to make some progress.  In my "employment-challenged induced" free time I made a logo, did some work on the site, and started the posting again.  We are holding our first event a week from Saturday at the new place.  Wish us luck, because, frankly, we're not ready.  4) Speaking of new place, I have one.  It is a great three bedroom in East Bremerton.  I moved in with Scott and his wife.  Scott and I used to be roommates back when I last lived in Bremerton... I guess some things never change.  Well, that is about it.  Count that as about five posts.

            A great American passed this weekend, and he certainly will be missed.  He became President a mere two days prior to my birth, but even in that short time, he made the world a safer place with the ending of the Iranian Hostage situation.  In my lifetime, the economy has grown like no other time in America's history, our enemy, the USSR, has been defeated, the Berlin wall has crumbled, and the threat of mutual animation has all but ended.  All of these things are a result of the leadership of Reagan, and my generation is grateful.  He made America prosperous for my parents, and safer for my children.  I am proud to be a Republican because of Reagan; I am proud to be an American because of Reagan.  Ronald Reagan, dead at 93.
