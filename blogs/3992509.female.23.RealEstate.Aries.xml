      Yesterday I asked Mark to stop by the store on his way home and grab water. Just water. He came home with:  Beer Soda Chips Lean Cuisine's (for me-- which was nice) Ice cream  The conversation following his arrival home with the groceries: Nicole: "This is great babe, but where's the water?" Mark: "Shit!"

      I think we should have Skip day...like where we all don't show up for work.&nbsp; Kind of like senior skip day in high school.&nbsp; If NO one shows up, there's nothing they can do, right?!?!?  OK maybe not.  OOOORRR we could just tell katherine it's skip day and she won't show up, but we all will.&nbsp; TROUBLE.

      The theme of this week must be funny smells.  First it's Anti's stinky car, toxic fumes in our department, and burning smells from my cubicle.  It's all making me sick!!  I'm going to be like Tara and puke.  It doesn't help that there's no food in my stomach except bad fumes.

      OK, i feel the need to make some remarks since lunch limited my ability to do so.&nbsp; I maybe a little harsh, or perhaps these incidences caused me more annoyance than they caused you, but none the less:  1)&nbsp; That car stunk to holy hell.  2)&nbsp; sadly, the inexpensive/cheap bug seems to run in the group of friends that Anti frequents.&nbsp; Apparently Daphne's is considered expensive.  3) I was annoyed  4) There's more but I'm still reeling from the pain so I can't think of it

      Random is kinda quiet, huh?&nbsp; We gotta get her to speak up, I wonder if she's a loud person.&nbsp; Her and Anti don't talk much for being such fab friends.

      I was once an ambitious worker during my intern/marketing assistant days, but then I realized I was getting screwed over more and more and lost a lot of my diligence.  How sad, huh?

      FU FU.&nbsp; I deny your bid and do not accept it. I do, however, enjoy hearing the entire price list of Qualcomm's cafeteria, how much my favorite cereal costs (it's nice to know it's the cheapest one in the whole store, i have expensive tastes) as well as how particular TREES must be expensive.  Now that I've had my budget and pricing training for the day, I think I can continue on with my life.

      Congrats Tara on receiving a bid to FU!  All your sorority sisters are dying to have more time with you in class.  I hear you've got a cute symbol, too!  A star..and not just any star, it's Starsky!  Your sorority colors are to die for.  Yellow and white.  Keep it up and you may win the Spirit of FU award.

      So, the first thing I see when I walk through the door this morning is the horrible mess and waste of time Anti spent on the work orders.  She alphabetized the WRONG stack of papers!!  Arrggghhh.  So, Random starts on Monday and she'll be sitting at the cubicle next to Kitty's office.  Her name is Sarah, but we can refer to her as Random.

      more posts by the guy:   1.&nbsp; I am just thankful that I don't work in the same building as her, and most of the time I only have to see her dumb ass less than an hour a day. How she became boss, I'm not sure. But she stays boss because the company has no structure and b/c her boss is too busy dealing with apartments to care about the hotel. That, and the fact that's she's manipulative. It could be worse I guess. I'm lucky I have a job. It's just her incompetence has really been agrivating me lately.   2.&nbsp; I'm sure I could get her in some major trouble. Possibly even removed. I can get 3 other people to go in with me and talk to her boss and let her know the things she's been doing. However, if that backfires, I could find myself out of a job... or left with the responsibilities (i.e. - being a scapegoat) of the job she's supposed to be doing. (read: make my own job harder). But I am contemplating going to her boss if the bitch doesn't let up.

      sounds like u guys have the same boss-- found this on my impreza board:   I don't usually throw the word "hate" around. But this bitch needs to:   a) die  b) retire  c) find a new wig  d) get fired  e) quit being such a bitch  f) all of the above   Grrrrr!!!!   She told another property's manager that she needs to lose weight, start doing her hair and make up because she looks unprofessional. Which is crap.. she looks totally professional. What a hooch.   She's mad at me because I got the internet fixed. Well, SOMEONE has to fix stuff around here. I wish she'd just retire. She is NUTS. She does NOTHING.... the only thing she does is drag everybody down. I can't stand this woman. Seriously. She doesn't work. She is destructive because of her own insecurities and it costs the company tons of money. The place runs better when she's not there.... MUCH better.   One would think if you almost DIED from being so uptight that when given a second chance at life you'd be a little bit nicer. But nnooooooo.   stupid bitch.   I hate her.   [/rant](for now)

      It was a sunny morning.&nbsp; I was minding my own business, assuming all was well with the properties I had just passed on to Anti, when suddenly, an email arrived in my inbox.&nbsp; The Falls were running a radio ad with RIVERSTONE'S PHONE NUMBER!!&nbsp; All hell broke loose as people ran in every direction in a giant frenzy to resolve the problem.&nbsp; But whose fault was it?&nbsp; Anti.&nbsp; Had poor Sacramento remained with me, they would have been safe.&nbsp; Alas, they got screwed.  Later that very same day, perversion ran rampant through Fairfield, as the following exchange took place:  Vikki: Whenever I hear Wyndover, I think "bend over" Wendy: Maybe that's because you're so used to hearing "bend over" at home Nicole: Ew, sick. I'm leaving.  Luckily, me and Annie weren't around to hear it, and our tender, young, innocent ears were saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;And, to help matters, Lumbergh was out of the office, so she wasn't around to complicate matters.  To be continued...  &nbsp;

      So while you bitches were out...I was talking to Wendy and Vikki about&nbsp;our new property, Wyndover. The dialog went something like this:  Vikki: Whenever I hear Wyndover, I think "bend over" Wendy: Maybe that's because you're so used to hearing "bend over" at home Nicole: Ew, sick. I'm leaving.

      So, Gramma & McCole notice that Gramma's cup is sitting on Anti's desk.  She was using Gramma's cup without even asking anyone if she could use it!  This cup has a see-through outer layer that you can personalize with photos or whatnot.  Later that day, Anti personalizes the outside of the cup with her own cutout of a beach.  She thinks she owns it!  No one could believe she's done something like this.   McCole starts up a conversation with BDub, trying to work in this "that's Gramma's cup" type of comment, but couldn't do it.  In the end, good 'ol BDub told Anti about who's cup it really was.   You'd think she probably then felt awful and apologized, thus ending this story.  BUT NO.     Quoted by McCole: "Apparently a long time ago she asked "someone" if she could have it. And this "someone", (Anti conveniently could not remember who) said yes.  Obviously it wasn't Gramma and BDub doesn't remember her asking either. She didn't even seem embarrassed about it either. I would have been freaking mortified. MORTIFIED! She made it seem like it wasn't her fault at all. WHO DOES THAT?!?!?!"   Everyone agreed.  Yes, WHO DOES THAT?!  Long story, short...Anti.

       Ann wants me to blog this, gay   Laguna was so cool, my aunt is staying wtih this pro golfer and it's right on the ocean...you walk out onto the balcony and you're on a cliff overlooking the beach, and you just walk down the stairs and you're on the sweetest beach ever. I was so jealous. My aunt wants to buy the property next to this house so I am hoping she does so I can stalk their house every weekend. My aunt said britney can get married 12 times a year for all she cares (she is pissed at her) and all she cares abuot is releasing her new single...which si MY PEROGATIVE (sp?) originally by bobby brown hahahaha and then she's getting a greatest hits album. I didn't get to ask her if she was already married. She wanted us to go to Santa Monica with her at 10pm to go have sushi with the damn backstreet boys but unfortunately I was too drunk and it was too late and too far to go do that, seeing as I had to work today. That woudl have been HILARIOUS. Regardless, it was cool to see this house and we ate really good food and it was fun and now my raging headache is due to a hangover. Oh and Nick Carter is accused of hitting Paris Hilton so she's having more issues with him, isn't that lovely? My god.

      Did you know that you can plug that number into AskJeeves.com for a link to a reverse phone directory lookup?  I just found that out.  Kinda cool, huh?  I have random numbers on my home phone, but I assume they're just telemarketers or people wanting me to do surveys on the phone with them.  Do you ever get those kinds of calls?

      Monster, the online job service, says that 61 percent of Americans consider themselves overworked and 86 percent aren't satisfied with their job.   Surprising? Not really. As the economy continues to improve and the presidential election draws closer, many people are looking to make a change. In fact, they are counting on making a change. There are positive signs of job growth in many sectors, including the interactive industry. Want a job in publishing? Better go the online route or to a multimedia outlet. That is where the growth is. Monster's Work/Life Balance Survey reported that 89 percent of Americans hope to change jobs within the next six months.  Everyone's experiencing office space everywhere.

      Just wanted to make a public announcement that I'm an ass for not coming back on Friday night--Justin was getting way too drunk to drive me and I didn't want to ride my bike.  So then i went to bed.  Which was actually a good thing cause I was quite sick on Saturday (everyone went out again as I stayed home and went to bed at 1030).  Stupid illness.  I gotta get back up to speed so I can drink and make myself ill again.
