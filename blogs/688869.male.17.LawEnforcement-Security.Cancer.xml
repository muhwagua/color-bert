      I just saw american history x. holy fucking shit. I saw it before but I honestly don't remembenr all this shit. I don't think I saw the whole thing. That was fucking amazing. I honestly do not know what to say. I almost cried at the end. I really did. I could have. I wanted to. I don't know what to think. I hate the world. I love the world. I don't understand the world. The world doesn't understand me. What does it all mean? Suddenly shakeer and his mundane existance isn't the most important thing in the world. suddenly there's more to american social politics then what we see on the nightly news. suddenly its all clear. Everything they said made sense. But I hate it. And I don't want to believe it. I don't know what to make of it. They say there are movies that can change your life. this might be one of them. maybe it will change me. maybe I'll forget about it all and instead update this with more garbage on stuff no one cares about.  or maybe I can change the world. or maybe something I do will matter. maybe.   But then again, its just a movie.   And I'm just a kid.

      Hi. No, life didn't give me any real lemons today, I just wanted to say that. And I did. No, I didn't make it up either. But I guess it applies to me. When I get lemons I'm not often one to complain. But I'm also not one to make lemonade out of it. No, I just shut the hell up and eat my lemons. Yeah. Just thought I'd share that.   But lets see, tuesday. Tuesday, as some of you might know, is always a good day because its a short day at school. That means I only have five classes and school starts at 9:25. If you're a keen reader (lol, yeah right) then you would me remember me mentioning something about leadership studies this morning. remember, I used it as a segue (thats segue, not segway...people commonly confuse these words...the latter is a fail transportation device, the former being a device used to provide transisition between two topics [face_geek]) to lead into the whole college/depression thing. Which, btw, wasn't that bad. That was alot of exageration and misguided hate on my part. My parents aren't THAT dumb. But whatever, moving on: leadership studies. In case you were sitting on the edge of your seat wondering what would happen then I'll tell you that I didn't go. Yeah. Didn't seem interesting. So yeah, moving on. Today, during my religion class I drew this:    (if the picture doesn't work drag it into your address bar or something)  Yeah, I was extremely bored. I hate that class. So I sat there drawing circles. Lots of circles. You see, its a comparitive religions class. And we're learning tribal religions. Guh, not very interesting. The worst part about the class though is the teacher. I hate her. You see, its a compartive religions class (I just said that). That is to say that we're learning about other religions. Heathen religions if you will. And the teacher is a former missionary. She just got the job a few weeks ago. So before this job she was missionaring (sp?). That is to say her former job was to convert people of heathen religions. Now her job is to teach said heathen religions. Kind of ironic. And it says something about the way in which the religions are taught. Here's an example. You see, as I said we're learning about tribal religions. To teach us about tribal religions, she brought in a video that she had filmed herself. The video was a video of tribal people in South America performing a Christian festival of some sort. They were doing the sign of the cross and saying the our father. Doing christian stuff. And that was her way of teaching tribal religions. Anyway, whatever. I was carrying it in my hand because I forgot to put it in my backpack on the way to english class and when I came into class I just set it on my desk and restarted the ongoing conversation me and some friends were having about whale fornication. More on that later. So it was sitting on my desk and my english theater thought it was art. Like it had a meaning. A purpose. A message. A theme. Maybe the small bubbles were being crushed in the opression of the large bubbles but were uniting to cover more space then them? Thats what she thought. But no I said, I just drew them in religion because I had nothing to do. Then class went on.  English is actually pretty fun. I thought it'd be tough because its accelerated but its not. We dont do much in class at all. Just sit. And talk. And laugh. And make fun of the really annoying jewish girl. But thats it. The written assignments are hard though.  Back on subject though, whale fornication. You see yesterday I was talking to awtrules and he said that whales actually have a slit. (male whales). And out of the slit comes their uhm, equipment. Its supposed to look like two fists joined together coming out of a vagina. Thats what he explained. Makes sense. That settles that. I was kind of close with my puch theory. The only remaining mystery though is WHERE they do it. I mean do they come up to the surface? Because then it'd be pretty well documented you'd think. Or do they do it underwater? Well whales need to come up for air. So maybe not. Then again, maybe whales are kind of impotent and can't do it for too long. Or maybe to do it in a cave? But nah they'd be too big. ANd if they do do it underwater wouldn't they cause splashing and waves? And wouldn't it make noise? Yeah, that'd be wierd. Hmm.  So yeah, nothing else much really happened today. Which kind of makes me think, what the hell will I right? This morning, on my way to school I was thinking of what this could possibly be about. My life isn't that exciting. Well it is occasionally. But definately not now. So what would I write about now? Just garbage like all that I guess. I kept thinking of cool stuff that COULD happen that I COULD right about. Which got me to thinking of making stuff out. Then I stopped myself. Whoa. There's the Jayson Blair thought process. Thats what mediapeople go through when they run out of stories. "Dammit are you SURE nothing interesting is happening? hmm...are you SURE there's none of this and that? Whatever, put it down anyway." And thats what I contemplated doing. But no. I haven't sunk that low.  Yet.  So yeah, hmm, plans for the rest of the day. Nothing much. Just homework. French. Calculus. History. Oh and I was just looking at the TV click and it says that american history x will be on today. I've seen it before (no really ansaf, I have) but I think I'll watch it again. Its probably not the best movie to watch on network telivision (probably all censored and cut up) but it'll give me something to watch while doing busywork. Yep. There's a plan.

      I'll take this oppurtunity to rape up the ass some of the quaint (I've been using that word alot lately) and peaceful historical myths that we've all come to grow up around. If you're in my history class this will seem irrelevent and you'll think I'm lame for posting them here . But I'll do so anyway. I just  urlLink posted them on IGN . And need content. So yeah, some myths:  The first English colonies were succesful because of tobacco and subjugation of the natives not because of help from Squanto and his indian buddies.   Every colony employed slavery, not just the rednecks in the south. Thats the very reason America was even succesful in the first place.   Columbus was a greedy and cruel bastard who had no idea what he had discovered for his entire life.   The pilgrims were just as religiously intolerant as the people they were escaping.   George Washington was a bad military commander.    heh, I discussed history in almost all of my entires so far. :/   And another thing. Its interesting how those sentences panned out. Notice how they decrease in length. Its symettric. And absolutely unintentional. I wonder why that is? Is it because I'm a naturally mathmetical person who's always looking for mathmatical patters in their life and therefore subconsciously establishes mathmatical patterns? Or is it something else? I think it might be something else. If you take a look at it it might have to do with fatigue. Maybe I got tired with each sentence. Maybe with each passing sentence I got more tired and so shortened my sentences to make it easier for me. Maybe I gained the ability to express my thoughts clearly through practice with each sentence. That then doesn't explain other patterns that I sometimes encounter when dividing up long messages in aim. That just explains the one above. For example, there's this pattern in which each sentence GROWS and then reaches a maximum point and then shortens. I encountered this last weekend while talking to tornado/jables/joey/fizban/dirty-jew. After some research adn thought, I made some conclusions. I theorized that as you typed and typed your hands got more attuned to typing. Your hands were warming up, you're able to type faster. More things are typed. As this happens, your hands begin to tire. You begin to reach the maximum point. The point of most effectiveness. The climax. The point of most pleasure. The orgasm if you will. At that point you've maxed. You can't go on any further. Well you can but not with that efficiency. You've depleted your stamina. And posting slows down. And plummets. Until you're as slow as where you started. In that process though you gain more strength. And things begin to go faster. And things begin to come easier. And the cycle begins again.  That's one possibility. Another is that its just pure chance. That would make more sense. We'll go with that.

      hi. so, its monday. It was a pretty big day at school today for me. Had that huge Chem test I talked about yesterday. It was pretty tought. I guess on a lot but I think I guessed right. We'll see. Then there was the essay test. Studied my fucking ass off for it. Did a lot of studying during my prep period and lunch. It helped. I think I did okay. Used up every minute but I think I did good. The question was harder then I planned for but I think I did good. My hand hurt like hell though. Fifty five minutes of straight writing. Not like you care. Who are you anyway? I wonder if anyone reads this. And if they do how would I know? Maybe they'll complain about how dumb it is on AIM. "What's the point?" they might ask. "So, do you really expect anyone to read?" No, I guess. I don't. It's a journal. But its published. Perhaps no one will read it, perhaps alot of people will read it. What matters is that I wrote it. And that I'm reading it.  but yeah, what else happened at school today? nothing much. We're having our first MUN meeting on wednesday. The person from eugene is coming down to talk. We're electing (which btw rhymes with erecting) officers. We decided on the leadership structure: me as grand master czar who has a three to four man team of bitches under his control. oh, and also each commitee (which there are like nine of) will have their own leaders. So thats that. And we'll figure out embassadors later. We're not worrying about country shit yet. Just comittees. And stuff. There are like eighty people signed up. EIGHTY FUCKING PEOPLE. Didn't expect THAT much support. so, we'll be meeting in the choir room. Or something like that. Should be fun. And nerveracking. I'm not the best public speaker you see. We'll see how it goes. I find myself saying that alot these days.   oh and tommorow is leadership studies in the morning. Which I really don't know if I should go to. I mean it means I have to wake up early. But mr hogan says its useful. And good. And it sounds interesting. But waking up. And all that extra work. :/ Might come in useful for MUN though. We'll see how it goes. I have to make the decision. And decisions depress me. As soon as I though to write it I felt sad. :(   see, that signifies that I'm sad. speaking of sad, my mom just came in here to depress me with various stuff. stuff about my future and careers and school. about how I'll be a failure in life because I'm not reading my SAT book. Or about how I'll never drive a good car because I'm not looking at colleges yet. Then they'll go into examples stuff about how so ans so person is so great and everything. I'll be buying things from target. Used cars. why? Because history fucking interests me. Instead of law. Instead of medicine. I enjoy history. but everyone who studies those things is a fucking loser. only a twenty thousand salary. no fun ever. can't afford anything they say. This is what I have to deal with. This kind you'll be a fucking failure talk is what I have to put up with just as I deliver four fucking ap classes. Four classes. But no one understands that. Nope. Have to go to HARVARD. MIT. YALE. WTF. WHO GOES THERE? NO FUCKING ONE. But I have to. Out of three hundred fucking thousands there are only three schools that I can go to. No other fucking choices. Any other college and I'm a guaranteed failure. I'm gonna be a car dealer. Insurance agent. If I don't go to hardvard mit or yale. Thats what I have to put up with. here's my dad lecturing me. And my mom sitting here agreeing even though she has no idea what he's talking about. great. this is why I hate my life. I was fine minutes before. but then they came in here and started fucking depressing me. I hate it. I hate it all.  But I'll stop talking about it now. I hate talking about it so you probably hate reading about it.   So yeah, board stuff. Lets see, the yab thing got big. Thats all I'll say about that. sachit got demodded. And I played  urlLink something of a part . I wonder if he'll read this. I wonder if anyone related to him will read this. Maybe it'll just sit here and he'll never know. Or maybe he'll punch his name into google one day while bored in his cubicle overlookign the big artificial lake and see it and go "heh". Maybe. Or maybe not. But its something to write about. I guess I in a way affected his demod. I guess not. Who cares? He sure doesn't. Or at least pretends not to. More important board stuff: awtrules is taking a break. He'll appreciate me writing about him...he always does. He's a good kid (lol kid). We'll see how that goes.   I've got my PSAT coming up in a few weeks. Big english term project due monday. That project, btw, is related to the book that you see to the left: interpreter of maladies. I thought it would make me look all sophisticated to have that book there (just like how I pretend to read, understand, and appreciate the new yorker) but in truth its just for school. Its really good though. Really really good. And I can connect to it on a personal level since the stories are about people of desi-origin living in America. Thats me. So, I like it.   btw, just in case anyone was wondering, whales fornicate by rubbing themselves against each other. You see, me and a guy in school (a guy who wants to be my gameboy) were having a discussion about how they did fornicate. We couldn't understand. My theory was that the male whale gets horny and releases tons of semen into the ocean. Then later on the female whale just uhm, takes it. And gets pregnant. It made sense. Thats what fish do. And it was hard to imagine whales really having sex in the penetration form we're familiar with. But I was wrong. They do penetrate. And their packages are like meters long. That must be a problem to their aerodynamicness. Must get in the way. Then again, maybe it folds back 180 degrees. That would make sense. Or maybe it just isn't too big when its flacid (hehe flacid, thats a funny word). Perhaps they have a pouch? Now thats a bit of a stretch. Maybe we ought to do more research. Speaking of research, I should probably go do some homework (yeah, right, I'm just gonna sit here after this).   Oh and for my blog thing I've got a couple of things planned. For example, one of those "now playing" things that say what song I'm listening to (wouldn't you be really interested in knowing that I'm listening to Coldplay - A Beautiful World right now? sure you would). Also, maybe a chatbox thing. That can serve as the way I'll get feedback. Like that'll happen. And some other stuff. We'll see. Yep.

      yeah, now I'll post about my first day at the ARC, an afterschool center for mentally disabled children. I realize that alot of you have seen this on IGN, and on mrbigggshot's site but I thought I needed some content. Then again, I don't want too much content at once (two entries, I'm such a beast*!). It'll mess up the flow of things. You'll get bored and I'll have nothing to post soon. But its okay. I'll manage. Damn, my daily life is intense.  so yeah, before you read my following I just want to say that I got the idea from  urlLink tardblog.com . If you take a look at the original tardblog, you'll notice that they have a  urlLink FAQ  and a  urlLink disclaimer  that explain their intent. I want you to read that if you have problems with the following. yeah, it might seem offensive but those links should help you understand thats its all in good fun.   so yeah, I started volunteering there on September 20th, 2003. The place, as I pointed out earlier is a special extra curricular education facility today: so basically where tards go after school since their unfortunate parents don't want them.   It was touching.   Believe it or not, one of the tards was laughing at another. For what? For being retarded. You see, it was just after snack time (something each and every one of them looked forward to ALOT...even though all it was was that we took some napkins and dumped like four potato chips on them for each of them) and they were all filing back into the "activity room". Now there's this super retarded tard called Marshall that is totally out of it. I've never seen him make contact with anyone. He just sits in the sofa that his mom put him and drools. He has a pipe coming out of his pants. I assume its his diaper apparatus. For the past week, his mother explains, he hasn't been going to school because he's been having seizures. Every day. And on Monday he bit off part of his toungue. Then she explains that they don't medicate him. At all. They don't believe in medicine. Later when I was flipping through the binder about the kid I discovered that in case of an emergency with, after calling 911, we should call a "Christian Health Official" that the mother had specified. They're one of those orthodox Christians that don't believe in medicine I assumed. Looks like his parents are effing tards as well. Every time you have a seizure your brain breaks down more or something. And the fuckinging tard parents weren't doing anything to prevent it. Anyway, as I was saying, we just came back from snacktime and one of the other workers there had already brought Marshall in. So when I brought the other kids and popped Pooh into the VCR (it was movie day...another highlight of their lives) I noticed Marshall curled up into a ball in the ground. Now I didn't think there was anything wrong it and frankly, I didn't care. Its not like he was missing out on anything. He, by the way, is blind too. I just thought he was lying down or something. Later on though, when my supervisor came in he saw Marshall on the ground and yelled the S word. In front of the tards. He ran to pick him up and was all worried that he fell. As he was picking him up, the tard next to him, Mike started laughing. At Marshall. My supervisor told him (with his latino accent) "is not funny Mike! Stop laughing. Is not funny. Is not funny." But Mike kept laughing. And laughed more. I couldn't help but laugh myself. Instead I just stood there thinking "What the fuck, Mike, you're drooling all over youself as well." Mike was rocking back and forth, his hands and sweatshirt covered in drool, laughing his ass off. I guess he just didn't get that he was a fucking tard as well. He dropped his glasses. Another one of the tards picked it up. She ran to the heater vent, took off the lid, and dropped them in.   And that was my first day with the tards.      *heh, I'm listening to Pearl Jam's Do The Evolution now. what does that have to do with anything? I dunno. Why didn't I include it up there? It would ruin the flow. And I wanted to show off my creative use of the *. Yep.

      Hi. I'm shakeer. yeah, that's a good way to start. Probably won't get me anywhere but at least it settles a few things. Namely that I'm shakeer.  This blog was created on a whim on a boring sunday afternoon (by boring I don't mean eventless, just boring...I have a huge AP Chem exam and AP US History essay test tommorow that I really should be studying for now). I saw some other people doing it and thought I'd do it myself. What makes this one more special then my previous attempts? Well, nothing really. I guess I'm a more mature person right now. yeah, right. I was listening to some good music before this so that might have something to do with it. Some radiohead. A little hives. Some pearl jam. A little mars volta. Even the beatles I think coldplay is next on the playlist. well, not really. But I just wanted to use that oppurtunity to show off my fine tastes in music. There's one item done. You see, I've been looking for ways to creatively expose my fine tastes in music lately. Maybe I should buy a radiohead tshirt. Make a thread on IGN? yeah, that's ambitious. Or I could just write it all down in my internet weblog that will be read by a collection of losers from around the world (okay so just mostly americans, a few canadians and jazzrule over in romania) and even smaller collection of real life friends.   But apparantly pouring out my heart and writing things down is good. It'll alow me to express myself. Build my writing skills. Real fucking quaint. We'll see how this goes.  Who knows how long this will last? In creating this I deleted all my previous blog entries. I read through them first and marvelled in their irrelevence and stupidty. Wow, my taste in music sure sucked back then. That's probably what this will serve. A few months later I can read it and see, wow I thought Chemistry was hard back then, now its hell. Or, damn, radiohead sucks. Thats what journals are for huh?   On that note, I guess I shouldn't have deleted my previous entries.   :/

      I was just about to write something about what happened last night. It was supposed to be really interesting. And depressing. I thought of it as I lay in bed last night. I composed it all neatly. But when I sat here to type it out just now, almost twenty four hours later, my hands went dull. Literally. They just lost energy. I coudln't bring myself to write it all out. I had it in my head. And thats all that seemed to matter. I didn't want to talk about it. I wanted to keep it to myself. And I guess thats okay.  Two people in the past week have asked why I have become so cynical as of late. The answer is, I don't know. It could be the stress. It really could. I do not joke when I say that I feel as if I could have a heart attack any moment now. My chest feels like a knot and I think I have an ulcer. That could be it. Maybe not. I don't even know if I really am cynical. I'm really starting to understand things now. Or at least I hope so. Maybe I'm not. Maybe thats just something I'm assuming. Whenever I have a relatively profound thought, I usually think about how much wiser I am now then I used to be. How much I've grown. I'm having that thought again now. But the thing is, one month later I'll read this blog entry and think that it is all wrong. That that can't be. That that was a pretty silly thing to think about. Thinking about the future just made my heart tie another knot. I wonder why that is. I hope I don't have anything worry about. For I know that I have alot of great things to look forward to. I really do. Those who know me will know what we're talking about. How's that for cynical? Well. Wait. I also know that there is alot of bad things that are coming up. Lots of stressful things. And thinking about them makes me feel bad. Really bad. It makes me not want to get up and do my homework. It makes me want to sit here and just surf the internet. But there are the good things. Oh yes, there are the good things. My heart just untied itself. You probably think I'm making this up. I assure you that I am not.  Wow. Writing this sure helped me. I feel alot better right now. I think I'm going to go and do some stuff.  Which reminds me. I really need some physical activity. That should relieve the stress. A friend suggested that to me today.  I want to thank that friend.  And I want to thank you all for listening. You're not doing anything but you really are helping. And that makes me smile.

      (IGN board stuff, ignore if you don't know/care:) Yesterday, I  urlLink fought the system . Because  urlLink the system  is such a retard, I won. The thing is though, he was right. Well not really. He was right for all the wrong reasons. The homeowrk board is a really bad idea. I mean, when I come onto the boards I usually try not to think of homework. And more often then not, my friends who are actually in my classes will be a better help to me then random people on the internet. Also, a board that relies on homework by itself to survive isn't the best idea. It would fit in CBs. But whatever. It was the principle of the matter. Once you have two 150-signature petitions asking for something, you had better acknowledge it. Even if its a bad idea. Unless you have  a really good reason. Which Tal didn't. He's quite the retard. And the fact that he's acting so childish now just proves it. For example, when someone posted  urlLink this thread  he locked it while somberly noting the spammy state of the board. Then when SemieE made a board about how hard it was to establish this board and how hard me and him worked to do it Tal deleted it. He wants the board to fail so he can delete it and rub it in our faces. Thats why he didn't make a sticky thread detailing all his nazi rules for the board. What a fucker, right? Yeah. Thats what I thought. Me on the other hand, I'm a social activist. I'm fulfilling my civic duty to the boards. I'm a reformist. Vigilante.  Watching out for the rest of us. Either that or I'm just that elitist jackass who always posts on Board Issues. Your choice.  Enough board stuff. Life stuff. This week looks like it'll be a light one. Relatively light. Lighter then last week. Less big things to worry about. Lots of teachers being sick (THE FAT SUB MADE AN APPEARANCE IN MY HISTORY CLASS TODAY...AND HE WAS STARING AT ME). Its all good. And plus, its a four day week. Plus, Model UN is looking good. Except for the fact that I didn't get to be in the committee I wanted to be in. (n)   Also, today was a tragic day. I lost a good friend. A very good friend. His name was Clix. And he was faithful. Trustworthy. Dedicated. And always so cheerful. He was last sighted at 1:48 PM. After that, he was no where to be seen. Today I lost a good buddy my friends. Today I lost my favorite mechanical pencil. Weep with me.   So yeah, got some aych que aych double you lined up for tonight. But I don't feel like doing it. I've got a prep period tommorow. We'll see how it goes.

      Today was a big day. Had the term project due. The mysterious late night phone call to worry about. And of course, the fact that my blog has reached a slump as of late. All day I fretted over what I would write today. Once again, the Jayson Blair throught process came into play. But I'll stop talking about Jayson Blair. The media stopped making fun of him a few weeks ago. Now its all about Queer Eye for a Straight Guy. (queer rhymes with shakeer!). But nevertheless, I'm running out of content. I don't want this turning into an account of what happened at school, how many times I went to the bathroom, or a vehicle for the augmentation of awtrules' ego. So I've decided that I'll stop publishing. I want my work to be immortalized for what it is. I want to get out of this business while I still can. Before I start producing crap.   Oh wait.   Who am I kidding?   I've been producing crap since day one.   Fuck that, I'm continuing.    So yeah, nothing much happened today. Or yesterday. A whole bunch of people almost killed themselves because of the term project. I didn't. *slicks back hair* What can I say? Thats what perfection does to you. Also, today was a model un meeting. Its gonna be difficult. In chemistry, we had a sub. He was fat. Fat people are funny. Speaking of fat, I don't get it. I eat alot but am not fat. I eat alot of junk food. So the other day I bought some dumb bells. 15 pounds. I think I'll use them when I watch TV. Then I can become big and strong and beat up all the bullies at school.   Today is election day in california. Yeah, I have nothing to say on that except that election rhymes with erection. Also, go Gary Coleman!  Oh, and today as I was unpacking my books and assorted study materials from my backpack, I came across a crumpled up note. Not having ever read or written this mysterious note, I was able to conclude that it did not belong to me. Nevertheless it was in my bag. After some consultation and contemplation, I expostulated that while I was hastily packing things into my bookbag so I could rush to my next class I must have shoved it in there, assuming it was mine. So I read it. Its pretty crazy. Read it for yourself:     Yeah, it makes no sense. But I love it.   Last night I watched Alias. It was my first time I'd watched it ever. And I loved it. Which reminds me, TWENTY FOUR PREMIERS IN TWENTY FOUR DAYS. Yeah. Exciting. I also watched Cold Case. Which was pretty good too. A few weeks ago, I watched Threat Matrix. Pretty cool. Its all exagerated and whatnot and in concordance with my teenage hate for everything "hollywood" I'll have to say that its really fake and whatnot but I liked it. It was good TV.   I think I'm gonna watch Everybody Loves Raymond tonight. And do some homework. Which includes, but is not limited to history and calculus. Sounds like a plan.

      Today for breakfast, I had two donuts. You know I have nothing to write about when I write about donuts. They were Krispy Kreme. I warme them up in the microwave for eight seconds each. It gives them that fresh baked taste. Exciting huh? No? Okay then.  Here's exciting. This morning, when I was taking a shower (to be precise, the actual thought process began when I was stepping INTO the shower but for the sake of brevity I'll just go with in the shower), I thought of something from my sixth grade. Back when I was in sixth grade this thing happened to me and at the time I was just amazed by its amazingness. I really wanted someone to share it with, some way to express, but never found a way. I really had thought that it would make for a great story, but it was a stupid and meaningless story, who would listen? Now I have an audience for my stupid meaningless stories: this stupid weblog. So here I go. I was in sixth grade (this is when I was living in singapore) and I had just come home from school. I was holding my backpack in my two hands and for some reason the zipper was opened all the way. And I mean ALL THE WAY. Like all the way to the bototm of the bag. So here's what happened. I don't know how but suddenly all the books and stuff in the bag shifted forward. Because the bag was being held by only the back section of the two sections that were produced since it was opened all the way, the books falling on it caused the front section to fall forward. If they fell all the way forward my books would have all fallen out beacuse they were pushing down it and gravity would have caused a fall. At this point there was only two things I could do. Suddenly make a grab for the second section or watch them all fall and have to pick them up later. But wait. No wait. I had a plan. In that single split second, without a thought, I dropped the bag. The entire bag. I let go and it fell to the ground. Everything was still in it since both sides had fallen beacuse of gravity. All my books were saved. Everything was still in there. All my stuff was safe. But it was all on the ground. Thats okay though, I was pretty goddamn proud of myself. I don't know how I thought of it, but I did. And I dropped it and saved myself. It was a genius plan and I couldn't believe I had thought of it. I remember thinking that I was quite a genius. I rememebr thinking, wow, I AM growing up, I'm sure I couldn't do genus stuff like that before. I wish I could tell someone. Maybe one day when the teacher makes us write about an experience that defined our youth, or an experience of our coming of age, I'll write about it. Maybe. But it never happened. Instead, five years later as I stepped into a shower half way across the world at 11 am in the morning before I went to Sunday School, the thought fired in my head. And I thought about it. And I wrote about it. On the internet. For people like you to read.

      (I'm talking about the IGN Boards btw so if you don't understand, stop reading). This is becoming like a weekly occurance. Except this time its really stupid. And twentyfour hours. So I can't just sleep through it. You see, there were these fuckheads on the vestibule condoning, glorifying, and admitting to rape. Naturally, I called them fuckheads. And earned myself twenty four hours. Thats justice for you. I always see peple swearing. People like jasonfindaly always drop in curse words here and there and only get edits and cute little messages from mods to go with them. Like for example, "naughty words are naughty*" Thats justice. Whatever. The mods suck. Tal is a poopy head.  *actual fucking message edited in by kavb

      So hi. So yeah, no update yesterday. I was really busy. Stayed up really late. And now I'm tired as hell. I had lots of stuff due today. Got all that done. And quite alot of stuff happened in the last two days. Well not really. But I think I can write some good stuff.   So yeah, yesterday was the MUN day. And that went well. We did our voting and put together a pretty solid "executive committee". Executive committee. I like that. And yeah, the woman from main MUN came down and explained stuff. She was fat. And kind of ugly. Okay, really ugly. And really fat. Some of even laughed at how fat she was. And how ugly she was. But thats okay. So yeah, that went well. Lots of support. We're gonna need to figure out some way to raise co' cash money for all these people. With our current budget we can only take like twenty people. But we'll figure it all out.   Other then that school was pretty boring today and yesterday. I've got that big english thing to take care of this weekend. That looks to be about it.   And today of course was friday. Friday means tard today. You see, on Fridays I go to volunteer at the ARC, an afterschool center for mentally retarded children. Basically, I hang out with them and whatnot. On my way there today I stopped at Panda Express for some food. The fortune cookie with my meal said "your love will help a child in need today". I was blown away.  Nothing significant happened though. One of them ate a bug. I'm not joking. You see, we took all the tards outside for a jolly good time in the sun and there's this one tard (daniel) who was looking for bugs. He had this jar of beatles in his hand (yeah I know, what the fuck) and was looking all over the grass and under things for beatles for his jar. And he found one. And picked it up. And looked at it. And put it in his fucking mouth. Me and the other guy watching him saw it. But we didn't do anything. He'd done it before apparantly. The other guy said he'd mark it in his logbook. We never did. Fucking tards.   Oh, and Marshall. Remember him? Well his parents have started druggin him. I guess the seizures got a little too intense. They're still fuckheads htough. The other guy working with me asked him how much they were drugging him and stuff and he just totally blew him off. They didn't want to talk about it. The guy explained to me that when Marshall was born their parents had expected of him such a great child. But instead they got Marshall. And they were really depresed. A few months later they divorced.   That's that.  oh, and I finished interpreter of maladies. It was good. Really good. Some of the stories were a tad feminine, but nevertheless really good. I enjoyed it. Thoroughly She's a really good writer and each of the stories left me wishing that I could spend an entire novel with these characters (it was a short story collection btw). She writes some really elegant prose. I really wish I could read more books but because of school all I ever read nowadays is school books. Its such a shame.   I'm thinking of renting a movie this weekend. Maybe I'll go do that later. Any suggestions?  yeah, you know I'm crazy when I'm asking my "diary" for suggestions. Whatever. I'm thinking 25th hour.   Other then that, I really can't think of anything to write this moment. How did I come up with so much earlier? Heh. I might add stuff later. Yeah. Later.

      So hi. It's wednesday. Not a real special wednesday. Just a regular wednesday. Nothing much happened today. Nothing at all. I got the chem test back. Did pretty good. But you probably don't care. I changed the layout here. But you probably don't care.   Yeah, american history x. It really was awesome. And the more I think about it the more I like. And the more I think about it the more I regret having to have seen it on WGN without so many things cut out and censored. For example the word nigger, a very important word in that movie, was never mentioned. Also all fuckings were changed to flipping, all hells to heck, all bullshits to bullspit, etc. Really lame. But still, the movie was powerful. I hope to see it again soon.  Hmm, lets see, before I got on the computer today my sister was using it and she was listening to some rap music. You know, that hip new fad with youngsters these days. Have you ever actually given this shit a listen? Honestly, it is so fucking retarded. Actual lyrics: "BOY WHATCHA GONNA DO?! ACT DA FOO!" The correct english translation of that would be "Hey there young lad, what do you plan on doing? I suggest you simulate an irrational and unknowing personna". How the hell that can be made into "ACT DA FOO!" escapes me. How ACT DA FOO is even grammatically plausiable also escapes me. How do they get away with this shit? Later on he says "TOO FAST TOO FURIOUS TOO ACT DA FOO!" I'm sorry but does that many ANY grammatical sense whatsoever? And then there was "WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IN THAT BAG?! WHATCHU GOT IN THAT BAG?! WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IN THAT ROOM?! WHATCHU GOT IN THAT ROOM?! WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IN THAT CASE?! WHATCHU GOT IN THAT CASE?!" How many ways can you ask a simple question like that? More importantly, what the hell is he asking? Even more importantly, why does he feel the need to repeat the question and stress all the wrong syllables and words. Who knows? Remember when music used to be good? I'm sure even rap music had a point not so long ago. But nope, not anymore. Ahh, I've still got my coldplay.   IZ GETTING HOT IN HERRE SO HOT SO HOT SO TAKE OFF ALL YOUR CLOTHES  So yeah, nothing much to write on today. Just because I'm low on content though I'll post this thing I wrote from a few days back. I dunno why, it just seemed something that would be fitting in a journal. Its for an assignment in religion class (guh, religion class) in which we had to spend some time in nature and talk about how we experienced god in doing so. Yeah, really gay. But I ended up liking what I wrote (oh btw, I didn't actually go out or anything, I just made it up):   You’d think that sitting out in the pouring rain, homework wouldn’t be the first thing on my mind. But it was. As I lay there, the mud on my back, my wet and tattered notebook in my hand, and a now useless pencil in my pocket, all I could think of was “Man, what am I gonna write for Ms. Myer’s writing assignment?” Which is kind of pitiful since there were really some beautiful things going on around me. For example, if I were to look up at a streetlight (yeah, a streetlight…so it wasn’t a completely natural setting, I was sitting in a little grassy gap between two housing developments through which ran some big electrical wires…I guess I could call it a “meadow”) I would have noticed a rather interesting phenomenon. The great thing about the streetlight is that it seems to illuminate each single raindrop. When our eyes usually see rain, we usually just see a massive block of falling water. Although we can say that we see “individual” raindrops since we do see individual particles, each a single raindrop is quickly replaced by another is it zooms down. Therefore, our eyes usually just focus in one spot and notice individual raindrops passing through that spot. When looking up at a light though, certain raindrops, the ones lucky enough to be at a special angle with the streetlight manage to flicker and glow for their spiraling moment of fame. As they fall to the ground, those special raindrops are highlighted and picked out of the rest. Although it happens very fast, because we’re registering individual raindrops in a manner that doesn’t usually take place, the raindrops seem to be suspended in the air for a moment. You can see how each of the raindrops have their own purpose, their own path, and their own impact on the world. If you look at each raindrop like that the raindrops seem more individual, the rain seems more personal. Each drop has a purpose, in each drop God is present. Time, place, emotion, and conflict seem irrelevant. Sitting there and watching the raindrops fall, one can forget anything. One can forget what they’re doing and one can forget why they’re there. Most importantly, one can forget about their homework.    So there. Really corny I know. But I got full credit. And she said I was a good writer. So its all good. And the best part is I BSed it. I only noticed the "phenomenom" while driving and I think the reason it happened and the raindrops "glided" was because the car was moving. So I doubt it would even take place while sitting in a "meadow". But yeah.  oh and stupid kajan tricked me into thinking that yab got demodded. yeah, I went crazy. It seemed like a sure sign of the apocalypse. I was ready to riot in the streets. But it was just a trick. Damn you kajan. I even screamed about it to awtrules*.  so yeah, not much homework today. Got some calculus and some french and I think I'll do some chem and history studying in advance. Maybe read some of my english term project book (which I have an essay due on friday even though I have only read half of guh).   also, tommorow is model un. big day. we'll see how that goes. then there's tons of stuff due friday. better get to work. oh and because of that I might not update tommorow. We'll see.   Later.   *for the purpose of awtrules-mention quotas

      This morning, on my way to school I thought that one of these days I'm going to go crazy with all this stress and like eat my fucking arm off and everyone will be like "What the fuck? Was he always that crazy? How could we not have seen that coming?" The fact that I'm having that thought signifies that even throughout my stress and tension, my primary concern is appreciation and acceptance. I'm a person who feels the need to belong.

      Hey, today is Tuesday and I'm now in Boston. Today was awesome; a cousin took me all around Boston by foot and subway. Everyone says this city is a poluted piece of shit; boy, are they wrong. Its awesome. I love the atmosphere here. First, we went to Harvard Square and the Harvard campus, then we walked down to the MIT campus. Checked out the Charles river. Took a train into town and checked out Boston town. Walked around Boston commons. Checked out this really cheap outdoor bookstore in an alley. Ate at Quincy Market. Went to the Harbor. The weather was great too today. Spent a lot of time just talking about colleges and the college process with him. Yesterday, we arrived in Boston and spent the night here. My aunt lives down in Conneticut and thats where we're staying; arrived there day before yesterday at night. The trip from DC took all day. But yeah, I love Boston. I love DC. I love the east coast. Nothing much else to say. This probably sounds really corny but I'm learning alot about myself here. Yeah. Wish I could go into it more but I uhm can't. Starting to realize how meaningless message boards are. I think I'm gonna go read or something now. :/

      Hey. Today was pretty coo'. Last night, after I posted, some more relatives came over from Conneticut. They have this little three year old daughter. Really cute. This morning, woke up, watched a little of the Finding Nemo DVD I bought for her, and then just did nothing for a while. Well, I just watched everyone wasting hours getting ready for today's activities. So yeah, we set out for DC metro again (this time by car after yesterday's great economical subway idea cost us over $30 total). First we went to the Pentagon. Well, as close as we could get, which is just the perimeter of the parking lot. Its pretty hard to appreciate the whole pentagon aspect from that perspective. We could probably get a good look at it from the top of the Washington Monument but in order to climb it you need to like reserve in advance. Which we didn't. Same goes for the White House. We looked at it from like five hundred feet away through that famous black fence. We could see like Delta Force looking guys on top of the building with their rifles. The road across from the White House was closed. I didn't even bother taking photos. Later, we passed a street sign that said 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. We pulled over really quickly so I could grab a photo. Cops were assraping us in less then ten seconds. I got the photo and ran. Took some other photos of monuments and statues around the city. We didn't get a chance to go to the Jefferson or Lincoln monuments either. Hopefully we'll go later. But yeah, we went to the National Museum of American History after that. It was totally awesome. I didn't see every last exhibit and just picked the ones that I really wanted to go to. And I really enjoyed every last one. I think I'll go back later. I really do love history. As I was looking at various exhibits and stuff I kept hoping that someone would ask me some historic question about something or other like "hey why was this harrison guy only president for six months?" I was bursting with my high school history class borne knowledge. Made sure to let everyone know. No one else who came really appreciated it. I stayed there for a pretty long time but didn't get a chance to buy anything, which I wanted to. I'll need to come back for that. Yesterday I bought a collection of newspaper frontpages from various significant Space Race stories. I have a similar thing from Pearl Harbor. I'm sure they have something like that at the American History museum. Gots to check that out. After that we went to the Natural History museum. It sucked. Alot. So then we went to Popeyes chicken (first time ever, it was really good) and then came home. And now here I am, watching CNN, listening to music, and posting this on my uncle's laptop. My little cousin is calling me over. We're going to someone's house tonight. So yeah, little hard to resist a cute three year old like this. [Michael Jackson joke]. Speaking of which, damn, EVERY SINGLE channel is having a [Whatever] of 2003 special now. Whatever, out.

      Hi. I'm writing in from my uncle's house here in a Virginia suburb outside of DC. My uncle is over, my grandma, my uncle's wife's parents, their daughter, another aunt, her wife, and their daughter. Oh and me my sister and mom. Lots of people. Not that huge a house. Yesterday, me and two cousins went over to the Georgetown campus (she goes to Georgetown) and just walked around M street and the such. I saw the Washington monument across from the Potomac (which is one beastly word to pronounce) for the first time. Wasn't as tall as I expected. Other then that, pretty cool. Actually, really cold. Seriously, cold as hell. But I like it. The east coast is neat like that. I really hope it snows. Everyone around here says that DC itself is really small. Seems pretty goshdarn big to me. Everything is so far apart. The ten minute drive from the airport took like two hours. The fifteen minute drive to Georgetown took forty-five. Today we took the subway back to metropolitan DC. The journey was over half an hour and there was lots of extra walking and driving...just took a long time to get there. A real journey. I don't know what I'm getting at here other then that 'round here, everything just feels...different. Round here, we always stand up straight. Round here, we always stay up late. So yeah, thats that. As I said, today we went into DC metro. We were planning on hitting up the Smithsonians (an arab guy remarking that he's "hitting up" significant buildings in DC just doesn't right does it?) but we ended up spending the entire day just at the Air and Space museum. It was really cool. The only other Smithsonian that I really want to visit was the Museum of American History and MAYBE Natural history. Mostly American. American and Air and Space were the only two I really wanted to visit. If we have time, there's the National Gallery of Art and National Archives. Plus, there's all the other art museums. But yeah, after checking out Air and Space, we went outside to the mall. Or The Mall. Capital letters. At least I think it was the mall. From inside the museum, we saw this really cool looking landmarkish building across the street. I figured it was the Supreme Court or something. Was actually just another museum. So we went out in the mall and on either side was the Capitol building and the Washington Monument. Me and my sister got pretty goshdarn excited when we saw those two. Took lots of pictures. Then we walked back to the subway, took the subway back, got lost again in the car, and came home. Ate dinner, watched X2. It was okay. Not as bad as I expected. People came over. People talked. People are still talking. I'm sitting here, dialup on my lap, checking up stuff on the internet. Thought I could get away from her, but I can't. She followed me across the country. But its all good. Anyway, night.

      I'd always thought "cathos" was a word. I knew it to mean some sort of overwhelming feeling - a feeling after something good has passed, a momentous feeling. Its the sort of feeling you feel after you have experienced something absolutely amazing and are sitting there just revelling in its glory. Today, I watched Return of the King. There are very many adjectives that could describe this film. The adjective I chose to describe my reaction to it was "cathos". Unfortuantely, I just consulted a dictionary; cathos is not a word. I couldn't even find anything near it. I have no idea where I got that word.  Anyway, as I was saying, there are very few words I can use to describe how great it was. Most definately the best film I have ever seen. It was over three hours long, and I appreciated every moment of it. There were times for tears, times for laughter, times for cheering, and times for awe. The perfect movie. The user Black_hat posted this on the IGN Boards, and it pretty much wraps up my feelings really well:   As Gandalf looks down at the Hobbits comfortingly, he smiles and tells them “Not all tears are an evil.” One thing you realize upon hearing this statement is that not only is it comforting to the Hobbits, but to the entire audience as well. We sit on the edge of our seats up on the mezzanine and if one were to look down the aisles, they would see everybody leaning over with their faces in a daze as we watch one of the greatest films ever created. Aside from it being one of the greatest films ever created, it may very well be the most beautiful. Lord of The Rings: Return of the King is not done in a classic epic style or sense of the word; it is done with a science in visual artistry that can be equated to a drug, causing noticeable physical affects upon our bodies. Our minds are rushed and awake, not able to lose consciousness of a moment in this equally real universe of Middle Earth. Countless times did my body quiver from a single word, frame or emotion. And as Gandalf speaks to one of the Hobbits about death, the gates are being pounded and my friend next to me leans forward, suddenly blending into the movie screen along with the entire audience as we listen captivated to a war that could very well be in complete accordance with reality. We unite as one and we all realize this is an experience unrivaled by anything we have ever experienced in a theatre. Everyone in the theatre had the dedication to make it to the first public showing of the film in the country and so with that dedication, we all were able to connect into one giant body that gasps at suspense, jumps in horror, laughs at humor and cries at the unadulterated magnificence of one of the greatest movies ever made. To say it is a “good movie,” is inaccurate. To say it is a “great movie,” is erroneous as well. The movie stands on it’s own with a depth to the characters and setting that makes our world seem mundane and fake. To say it creates its own form of cinema classicalism is a very precise statement. It is the epic of our generation and of future generations. It is the epic one could hope to experience at the height of their youth or in their entire life.   Also, I'm flying in a few hours. I don't think I'll update from there but I'm not sure. As I said, I'll try my best. Until then, bye and happy holidays. Watch ROTK whatever chance you get. I will definately watch it one more time this holiday.

      Today is tuesday. A day of great anticipation. Tommorow is a big day. A HUGE DAY. Let's see. First, I have a really hard history test. Then, I have to serve JUG. Then, its a really hard chemistry test. Then its some of that math seminar with Dr. G. And then, LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING. Just got my tickets off of Fandango! After that, come home, pack, get a few hours of sleep, and then flight for DC at 3 in the morning! Return of the King will be choice. Everyone needs to start using the word choice more. I got the JUG for eating in the library during my free period. Psh. Everybody eats in the library during free period. Lame. Anyway, I really have nothing more to say. Tonight's agenda is study for chem, study for history, watch 24. Sounds good. Sorry for the crappy update. Oh and unless I update tommorow night, I'm not sure if I'll be able to update from DC and so there won't be anything until I get back in January. I'll try my best.   I hope I buy that goddamn domain before I go though...

      I couldn't get over how cool the keyboard thing from up top was so I fiddled around some more with the scanner. I was feelin' real creative. First, I made this:     Just a simple scan of me jerking my hand (yeah, funny) in the scanner. Then I did the "cutout" effect to make it look sort of cartoony. But the creativity didn't stop there. I used the picture to produce  urlLink splash mockup . Should I even have a splash page? (A splash page is the first page you'd enter when typing the URL of the site into your browser...an intro site of sorts.) I also did some other scanning to make these two mockups:  urlLink splash2.html  and  urlLink splash3.html . I didn't like the way they looked much (didn't match the rest of the website) so I sort of abandoned them. Didn't even bother linking. But it was a good concept...I had an idea along time ago for a website with a primarily handdrawn interface. I guess it would be cooler if I was actually good at drawing stuff with my hands. Looks like I'm only good at scanning things in my scanner. Woop-te-doo. Time to do some homework I suppose.

      Check  urlLink this  out- quite possibly the single greatest music video ever filmed...that dance...those random words...all perfect. It's motivated me to film my own movie, thats for sure. Anyway yeah, nothing much to do right now. Still got some homework, gonna go to sunday school soon, and have some packing to do. I'm just posting because I felt the need to show that video to people. And they captured ol' Saddam last night. Thats great news, and I'm great it happend. Nevertheless, I think people are thinking that it really means something. It doesn't. They found him hiding in a hole. He wasn't a menace any longer; sure, he needed to be brought to justice. I hate to sound so cynical, but I think finding Bin Laden would be more important. Or bringing peace to Iraq as opposed to selling off contracts to Haliburton and Nextel (and definatley not to those filthy european countries who didn't help us in the war and don't deserve to get the spoils...yeah, like the goddamn ceo of haliburton was the one who liberated iraq). Once again, this might be a bit of a morale blow to Iraqi insurgents, but in the grander scale, it means very little. They'll continue to do what they do. At least that'll show us the folly of our efforts there. But yeah, I'm glad they captured him and for the most part, America is doing a pretty good job in Iraq. But one things for sure: this'll help W's re-election campaign..   Oh, and I wrote a story about Ol' Six Pack Jack Simmons. The story was written after someone mentioned the song about Pool from the music man:  My physics teacher last year played us that song. We were doing some physics thing that could somehow be applied through pool and he'd tell us about how when he was a kid he'd skip school and go down to the pool hall and play pool. They caught on eventually. He was a cool guy. Jack Simmons. Six Pack Jack. He was crazy though. And he hated kids. He hated every one of us. Funny guy though. Really old. Old people are funny. Anyway, he gave us extra credit if we could some use physics tricks to get two pre-positioned pool balls into two different holes. Two kids got it. Two kids he really hated. He didn't let anyone else try it. He gave lots of extra credit. Once he gave extra credit for if you would allow him to shock you with a crank electricity generator he had. You'd put one hand on each prod thing and he'd crank it. Oh and boy, would he crank it. Those were the best moments of my life. Wind in my hair. Electricty through my chest. Yeah, I miss those days. After that, my life kind of spiraled downward. "This doesn't hurt that much" I said. It really didn't. It was jsut really hard to let go. It forms some sort of attraction. And your hands sort of start vibrating. So he replied, "Doesn't hurt huh?" He had a diabolical grin on his face. He started cranking harder. I stared square at him. My hands rocked back and forth. I tried letting go. "What about now?!" I held on. "Does it hurt now?!" I can't remember what happened then. He kept cranking. Eventually he let go. That was that. In any case, at the end of the unit involving pool he brought in that song. He had this really awesome sound system. He walked around the room placing speakers in places. And then he played the song. He sat down on a stool. Head held up by his elbow. A grin started spreading across his face. A tap of the foot. Another. Jack was thinking of his childhood. We all looked at him. That smile was so cute. He looked like a little baby. Jack was a crazy guy. He was obsessed with astronomy and pretty much devoted his life to it. He seemed like the kind of guy who would live alone but we knew he had a wife. We didn't know about kids but were pretty sure there wre none. Once I emailed him at like 2 in the morning and he replied in like ten minutes. He doesn't sleep. He usually stays up, drinks beer, does physics, and watches baseball. So it goes.

      Keiko. The fucking whale. IS DEAD. CARETAKERS IN NORWAY ANNOUNCED TODAY THAT KEIKO, THE WHALE WHO STARRED IN SUCH GREAT FILMS AS FREE WILLY, FREE WILLY 2, AND FREE WILLY 3, IS DEAD. I knew Keiko. I met him once. (Before he was released he was the Oregon Aquarium.) We were like brothers. We went way back. And then what? I'll tell you then what. ****ing environmentalists demanded his release, probably utilizing such clever puns for this cause as "free free willy" or just to keep it concice "free willy". Apparantly, it was a crime for him to have been penned up like that. He was released into the wild. And now what? He's dead. Thanks alot environmentalist. Thanks ALOT. Thanks alot for NOTHING. Except death. And grief. MOURN my readers MOURN.

      After Last Samurai I did a couple things today. Firstly, I watched Pirates of the Carribean. I've seen it before but it was still fun. Then, I did some work on the site - as you can see, a new banner thing. Basically, I took the top off the scanner, propped the keyboard up with some books (upside down) and awkwardly placed my hands upsidedown to make them look like I was typing. It was pretty difficult to do and the result was pretty cool-looking. Then I cropped it up and blurred it up to make it look shitty. Thats what you see up there. Then I watched SNL. For the most part, it was okay. The cartoon (TV funhouse thing) was absolutely fucking hilarious. I was laughing from start to finish harder then I have for anything on TV in a very long time. Splitting ends. It was a President Bush thing; you know how he's been doing photo-ops where he dresses up as stuff? Like the aircraft carrier thing, steel worker thing, and of course, thanksgiving in Iraq? They had him doing it for all kinds of other ridiculous things. Like a trip to africa dressed as a gorilla. A medicare proposal in a wheelchair and IV. I guess you had to had seen it. Anyway, then I came online and split my guts out to some shithead loser who I know is not only totally full of shit even though I have no idea who the fuck he or she really is, just sat there and judged me. And acted like a total tool. Just talking to him/her was frustrating. Most of you probably just think I'm being a pretentious loser who probably has no right to say things like that because I have no legitimate issues in my life (this conclusion may come from a number of things - the assumption that your lifestyles gives rise to more issues then mine, the assumption that you are superior to me, the assumption that I'm too sheltered to have issues). But whatever. Me accusing you of making such accusations is pretty judgemental in itself. And if there's one thing I hate more then [hip current culture/political reference], its judgemental people. I hate being judged and I hate to judge.   There's a fucking new years resolution.

      Hey, just got back from the Last Samurai. It was a great movie. There were some things that were pretty lame about it - but thats to be expected with any "epic movie". For example, in the end, (if you haven't seen the movie, you probably don't want to highlight the following)   after the final battle, I don't think Tom Cruise should have lived. Every last samurai was gunned down, what made Tom Cruise so special? The movie, and its message, would probably have been infinitely more powerful if Tom Cruise had died with the all the samurai.  But yeah, it was a great sort of "against-the-odds" epic movie with the usual epic/hero cycle. The battles and fights were really well done and enjoyable. It had its fare share of cliches but some genuine emotion did shine through so it was more then made up for. But whatever, it was fun.  Oh and it needed more ninjas. Ninjas are fucking awesome.

      Its Saturday morning. I haven't updated in quite a while and I suppose there's a pretty good reason for that. Or maybe there isn't. Now I'll attempt to justify it- to myself at least. You see, I'm a person who moves in multiple circles (granted they are VERY small circles in some cases and there are probably only three distinct ones...hey, the cicles, like a circus! My life IS like a circus!). The thing about these circles though is that they are indepednent of each other (for the most part). There are things that only certain circles know, there are things that only certain things can know and there are things that only certain circles give a shit about. For some fact of my life to be told to a circle that it doesn't need to be told to would be breach the circle and have dangerous effects. Unfortunately, the nature of this sort of medium is that representatives of all circles have an oppurtunity to access information related to circles that may or not be their own. Thus, as my life began to shift balance from one circle to another, and as more in my life began to happen related to one circle over another, it became very difficult to succesfully produce content here that would not breach circles. At this point, you're probably just thinking "what the fuck is he talking about?" Fair enough. You see, I guess you can think of this as a demonstration of the circle theory. I just talked about a whole bunch of stuff that probably doesn't interest any circle. Then again, for me to continue talking about the circles would probably just defeat the whole purpose of what I'm doing- it would breach the circles, the very thing I'm trying not to do here. In any case, the problems of circles arise from others. I'm the same in all circles (I hope), its just the way in which I interact with others. So I suppose I should stop talking about others here, and just talk about myself. Thats always fun. Kapiche?   Heh, did I just write all that about circles? Thats pretty interesting. Circles. Remember that piece of "art" I posted about two and a half months ago here?  urlLink This.  Its circles. On that note, feel free to assume what circle YOU are in. For some of you it'll be easy. Some of you might be in multiple circles. Some of you might be in none.   But yeah, enough about circles. Lets talk about other stuff. Lets see, my last few updates have been about stress/insanity. Hmm. I suppose the stress level has died down. This week was quite a hectic week but the week has come to an end. Its Saturday. Saturday morning. I don't have any huge projects or papers to do this weekend for the first time in like ever. I have some chem homework which believe it or not I woke up early and finished today (even though I went to sleep at like 2 last night...mostly after watching conan). That was pretty much the biggest assignment of the weekend. And thats done. Coo. Now I just have some reading to do and stuff. Easy peasy. Japaneasy. Maybe I'll watch a movie or something later? Goddamn DVD player is broken so I can't watch any DVDs.  Oh by the way, I got an iPod. Its pretty neat. In fact, I love it. It absolutely rocks. One of the best things I've ever bought. Subsequently, my music collection has expanded. Favorite artists now include (but not limited to): the beatles, ben folds (and/or the ben folds five), the clash, coldplay, counting crows, elliot smith, flaming lips,  the hives, mars volta, pearl jam, radiohead, pavement, dandy warhols, REM, the shins, the vines, white stripes, the who. Yeah. My sister put some of her songs on my iPod too. Most of them are "gangsta rap" and the such. Pretty goshdarn ridiculous music. I won't bother going into that other then to say: "ONE TWO THREE GO MY BABY DON'T MESS AROUND BECAUSE SHE LOVES ME SO AND THIS I KNOW FO SHO". Sofa king ridiculous. I love it.  Speaking of school, I managed to inch out a 4. this term. Last term I had an one A- (history) so I had 3.997 or something. Now its at a 4. My culm is like 3.999 or something because I've had all As except for an A- in freshman PE. GRR. That pisses me off so much. (As demonstrated by the grr.) But thats good. One things for sure: that won't last after finals. But its okay. Three AP classes and an accel. class - I can handle it.  This upcoming week shouldn't too hard. On wednesday night, I fly out to DC and hit up the west coast (visiting relatives and historic sites...yippee!). Downside: I miss the ROTK premiere. But I'll watch it there. Hopefully. Anyway, yeah, that means I miss two days of school (well two half days...so one day). I'll need to make some stuff up to catch up with that but other then that, cake. Oh and I've got a huge religion presenetation due. On Islam. Shouldn't be too hard. For the islam unit, mrs myers (worst teacher ever, if you'll remember from previous entries) is totally making me teach the fucking class since she has no idea what she's talking about. Oh and MUN. Yeah, MUN is in a tizzy.   But yeah, should be an easy week. Shit is looking good. And then its vacation. After that though, back to school and...FINALS! :*(  Oh yeah, if you look at the side of the page, I'm reading Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse Five right now. Its a really interesting book. Really bizarre though. REALLY BIZARRE. Oh yeah, so I'm reading books again. Before, I never found time to read any books. I blamed it on schoo. I had Kerouac's On the Road and I had it for a few weeks and only got a few pages done. Then, I picked up the Da Vinci Code. I finished the 450 page book in under 24 hours. On a school day. A busy school day. A busy school day after which I had to volunteer at the ARC. I had the time- just not the motivation. So then I vowed to start reading again. And now I'm reading Slaughterhouse Five. Oh and by the by, Da Vinci Code was pretty goshdarn interesting. It starts off as just a cheap thriller but it really hooks you in. And then it propels you through tons of history and other interesting stuff. It was a real "edge of your seat page turner" kind of book. As I said, I couldn't put it down. I found the ending to be sort of dissapointing though. Meh. I'd still recommend it. Just for all the history and whatnot in it.  Oh, one more thing, I'm thinking of getting a domain...what should I get? shakeer.org or shakeer.com? Or something without shakeer in it?  I can't think of much else to say right now. So yeah, later.

      Hi. Yeah. Whoa. Lots of shit going on. Not a lot of time to talk about it. I'm only updating this because if you've accessed this the way I wanted you to access it, I now have a domain name. I got it for $5. Plus I got some kickass hosting for free. So I'm just testing this out. For now, this will link to this. We'll see how it goes.   PS. This hopefully means regular updates.  Hopefully.

      A couple months ago, I wrote up a really empassioned entry at like 12:30 at night about how much I hated the Junior Year and about how difficult school was. I was all stressed out and overworked and just needed an outlet to vent. I wrote it upstairs and saved it as a .txt. I never got a chance to publish it. I read it the next day and it looked like total shit. Just a bunch of whining. Now, its January. Finals week was last week. I just came off of an extremely relaxing weekend and now, I'm back into the fray. I thought this would be an easy week but it uhm, won't. I've got tons of history reading, huge impending Chemistry decision (with piles of corresponding work), prospects of the Junior paper, Christian Service I'm really behind on, a religion class that will actually be hard, a new (and harder!) French teacher, trying to get MUN back up and running, and of course, Jesuit decided this would be a great week to get Juniors to start preparing for college! Oh, and not to mention fucking forecasting. What better timing?! I think they're just trying to murder us with all this stress. But, whatever, I'm feeling good. Confident. The whole year, I told myself that this would be the semester where I would fuck up. I overloaded on way too many difficult classes. It would not be possible to excel this time. But yeah, whatever, I did okay. I hate to brag but it looks like I might be pulling by with a 4.0 this semseter. I sort of wish I didn't do so well - it sort of jades me. Now me (and more importantly, my parents) take my grades for granted. But whatever. Now, I have a cushion. I can do poorly in the coming weeks. Whatever, judging by the looks of things, its only uphill from here. Oh yeah. That was a metaphor I included in that original thing. The Junior year is like an uphill battle. And it really is. But I'm learning a lot. Thats why I was okay with not a 4.0 this time. I knew I tried my hardest and I knew I learned a shitload. That was good enough. I just had a good discussion with my parents about how much more important that is then numbers and shit. And how I hate people who just go to school and work so they can get into a good college. And just contribute in class for the sake of fucking participation points. At least I can pride myself on being beyond that. Problem is, these grades contradict that. Do you get what I'm saying? Whatever, I probably sound really arrogant and pretentious saying that so I'll stop. Its pretty late. Probably should go to sleep. Later. Oh and the New Hampshire primaries are tommorow. That should be exciting. And I need a haircut. Plus, I'll have to do a lot of work tommorow. Also, I hope I don't get whacked my the mafia tommorow. (If you know what I mean, you know what I mean.)

      I just watched the movie Adaptation and I know I say this a lot, but that was the best movie I've seen in a long time. If you've seen it, the movie sort of writes itself as it goes and so I'll try to do that.   So I watched the movie and came upstairs for dinner. As I sat there, eating dinner, staring down, my mom was barking into the phone next to me with some faraway relative of ours. It sounded important. I thought about how a movie about that important thing would work. About how he or she would be played and who would play them. I'd write the script I thought. But no, it would never work. These people wouldn't be able to appreciate a good movie like that. It just wouldn't work. Of course it was an obvious thing to me why it wouldn't work but then I tried to simplify it all so I could explain it to others. I suppose its because I'm foreign and all. Things like movies and movie scripts just don't fit into my world the way they do into the world of Charlie Kauffman. There's just that barrier that provides that medium of creative expression from pervading into our existence. Whatever that means. But back to me being foreign. Sometimes, I wish I weren't. It would make things like this easier. I would be go about doing these things in a much easier way. I'm not saying that I wish I was white or I wish I was black as so many fucked up youths believe. I just wish I wasn't different. It would be easier that way. I don't want the first thing that people think when they see me is "he's brown". I want to be appreciated and noticed for other things. Of course, I want to be different. I want to be set apart. But I don't want what sets me apart to be something beyond my choosing. Beyond my control. I want to individually determine my own methods of creative aesthetic expression; I want to dictate the way in which others percieve me. Not because I really care about how others percieve me but because I want to be able to define my own identity and because the culture we live in is so driven by the way we look, I want to control that. I don't want that to hinder me. Come to think of it, I don't want for myself to look different. I guess I don't want to change. I want others to change. I want society to change. Fuck then, I guess I'm screwed.  This whole argument made a lot more sense when I thought about it. I bet if I explained it in speaking, where I wouldn't have to worry about all these annoying grammatical conventions and whatnot, it would've been easier. Well, then again, I would've sucked at explaining it to others because I would have constantly worried about how they percieved that last word or sentence I just said and as I got caught up in that, I'd stumble and mess up. That wouldn't be good. You know what I need? One of those handheld voice recorders. Like Charlie Kaufman. Yeah.  Also, sometimes, when I tell people this, or tell people the thought that I (and pretty much every other young person thats struggling to find their identity or is struggling to creatively express themself) sometimes think I have thoughts more profound then others; thoughts that others may be incapable of percieving, they ask me if I've read the Catcher in the Rye. Some of the cleverer ones tell me that I've read Catcher in the Rye too many times. Well, thing is, I read the book a year and a half ago, and looking back at it, I don't think I "got" it. In fact, I know I didn't get it. I think I need to read it again. Yeah, I'll read it again.

      So what happened was like me and all my buddies were just hanging out and chillin' like we always do since we're cool like that but it was getting pretty late so we started walking to the parking lot and when I got near my car (well actually, its not my car, its my moms but I don't tell my friends that because if I did they'll totally be all like "haha dude, you like suck and stuff!"), I totally like turned around and pretended not to notice it (which would actually be pretty hard, its one of those minivans...and I know you think those thigns are like pretty lame and stuff since they take so much gas and no one uses them for their purpose but with me its different you see, I actually take it off-roading with some of my friends sometimes...if only the stupid media would stop giving SUVs and SUV owners such a bad rap...I mean C'MON) and with a slightly dumbfounded look on my face, exclaimed "dude, wheres my car?!" and suddenly all my friends were all totally like "hahahhaha good one shakeer!!!" and I was like "yeah, thats right" and I did another flip and then finally, jerking my head back, pretended to finally "notice it" and then a few moments later, I was like "haha, just kidding guys" and they were like "nice" but come to think of it, they didn't laugh as much this time as last time when it was pretty late at night and me and my crew were out cruising the streets (no doubt causing trouble straight up, if ya know what I mean) when suddenly we heard these dogs barking and I like totally flailed my arms into the air and yelled "WHO LET THE DOGS OUT?!" like that one song from a years by the Baha men!

      Thats a good question. I guess writing and being published like this is a sort of primal verification: I am published, therefore I exist. A distinct part of exists and appears somewhere beyond myself. My thoughts aren't just stuck inside my muddled head, they're out in the real world being read, appreciated, or even just acknowledged. I've made my mark on the world and although not a significantly tangible mark, an intristic and personal mark nevertheless. That I guess is the philosophical reason. The more practical reason is well, this is what I do. I like to do it. It might be the norm but I guess its just something I like to do. Don't get me wrong; I don't mean that in the "I'm deviating from the mainstream so I'm cool" way. To me, that sort of thing is a load of bullshit. But I probably shouldn't say that. That would be being judgemental. And shakeer don't like being judgemental. As I was saying, this is just the way I enjoy expressing myself. Different people express themselves in different ways. This way is pretty easy. I don't really have to make much of an effort but I can be heard anyway. Of course, to others updating a website like this may seem like a big waste of time. Well, this is how I like to spend my time thank you very much. How they choose to express themself is different. Its not right and its not wrong. Just different. As I was saying though, this way is pretty easy. I don't have to show up and do anything or impress anyone. All I have to do is type up some shit and press post. And I must say, it's pretty gratifying. I mean, unlike people who choose to express themselves more openly, I don't need to worry about hearing the boos. I don't have to deal with someone's dissatisfaction in my face. Yeah, I guess in that regard, its a pretty cowardly thing to do (writing a journal like such) but I can live with that.   Anyway, I also had a 519 word observation on friendship written up and posted a few minutes ago but I just removed it because it probably would do me more damage then good. Yeah.

      Jack Simmons that is. Earlier this week, I was flipping through my old Physics notebook when I came across a page in the back somewhere where I had compiled a bunch of crazy quotes from Ol' Six Pack Jack. I've only showed them to a few people so I figured this would be a good place to post them. Here they are:  "Then Albert Einstein died. But thats okay. He already split the atom." "If you shrunk yourself into an atom, you'd get killed by a flying electron. If you were an electron, he acceleartion would kill you." "Is your life insurance paid up?!" (asked before conducting an experiment on a volunteer) "I wish I was 8 feet tall and 350 pounds so I could tie you to a rope and fling you into space." "You want some more? What NOW?! Not so tough anymore, huh?!" (said while pumping electricity through a student) "How do you speal nuclear? N-U-C-L-E-A-R. Like nuclear physics. Now some of you might want to switch the N and the U and say that all year you've been unclear about what we've been doing..." "When I was in 2nd grade, the teacher said that World War II had started. I was so excited! She was sad but for me, it was great! I mean, what could be cooler than war and shooting and stuff?!" "And then Truman made a fatal decision. Not so fatal for us, pretty fatal for those Japanese." (speaking about atom bomb) "Oh I'm sorry, were you Japanese? I'm only joking..." (a few seconds later...in response to a disgusted Korean student) "So kids, theres radiation in this room, and you can't do anything about it, and it's shortening your life!" "I have a radioactive cheek!" "I have a radioactive foot!" "The procrastinatation club wanted to put in an announcement but they figured they'd put it off until next week" (said right after the announcements...about five different times in the year) "Next week, we'll learn how to get enough energy to make bombs to blow up entire cities! Oh, what fun!" "We're all goin' fission!" "You want an A? Ten bucks! I'm serious." "You can have a Physics party...sit by a warm fire with your buddies, have your Physics problems out and some bee- I mean ROOT BEER!" (he thought that one HI-LAR-I-OUS)

And I see, they're tackling racial issues too...a red and yellow O engaging in some sort of relationship, oh my, how controversial! These sexually-suggested viral marketing tactics are absolutely deplorable! It's moves like these that are corrupting our society and the minds of our children! What next, one of the O's ripping off another's garment to reveal bare breasts on national television?! Psh, two of the same letter holding hands and kissing in public like that...what next, same-sex civil unions?! Or even more alarming, SAME-LETTER MARIAGES! Oh heavens, I don't know WHAT I'd do if such were to happen!

      Poeple should know that the things I do, the things I say I like, I say I like them, and I do them because I actually do like doing them and they are in my character and I don't just say I like them and don't just do them because I want to impress people or make a point.   On that token, I just watched "American Splendor". It was really funny. I loved it...one of the best movies of 2003.

      Someone needs to film this ASAP. Okay so yeah, it's an 80s music video. Here's the plan: there are a bunch of kids sitting in a classroom, staring at the clock. It's the late afternoon and the teacher is droning on about Geometry which is really BORING. He's wearing a tweed jacket (with those elbow pads), a bad tie, and has glasses. Suddenly, some kid opens the door and yells, "SCHOOL'S OUT!" (can be substited with "LET'S ROCK!! or "I WANNA ROCK!!"). As soon as he says this, loud music comes on and everybody suddenly leaps up in joy and the camera pauses on people jumping up in their awkward poses. Then when the camera starts moving again, everyone will be jumping all over tables and dancing and there will be a disco ball. Then the kid that ran in will yell "GUITAR!" and suddenly a guitar will come flying out of the window (breaking the window) and will fly into his hands. He'll spin it around his arm a few times and then start playing it (he has to make sure to do more tricks/stunts with his guitar then actually play it). The music will go on and there will be random shots of everyone getting FONKAY and the teacher will be cowering behind the desk while all the kids are having fun. He'll be holding a ruler. Then, the guitarist will do a really awesome wail solo on his guitar and the ROCK WAVES that come out of it and they'll transform the lameass teacher into another bandmember! Then the new rocker will down at his ruler dumbfounded...another rock wave will turn it into a guitar and he'll join in and start playing! (Teacher may or not also be transformed into a hot stripper). There will also be a major nerd tryiing to leave the classroom complaining but all the kids will throw pencils, paper airplanes, and apples at him. A rock wave will turn him into a rocking bandmember too! There can also be a really dorky girl in a heavy sweater and glasses who progressively turns really hot by the end of the song. Oh and everyone just keeps playing and there can be other school officials wondering what all that damn music is all about. Unfortunately though, they can't get into the room and just have to stand outside the room and make threatening gestures. It'll be cool. All I need now is some capital and a production team. Also, a flying guitar.

       As of late, most of my entries have been really sparse. They're full of substance but they just lack uhh substance. I mean, they've mostly just been links, photos, or tidbits of some sort. Now I'm thinking of writing one of the entries of old, with writing about what I was thinking and this and that. I hope I didn't sound too corny and cynical. Or too whiny or pretentious. Maybe that's what I stopped doing those. No wait, I think I stopped because of the circles. Ahh yes, the circles. Do you remember the circles? Few will remember the circles. The circles was a long time ago. Vintage Shakeer. The circles can be summed up effectively with a cryptic entry from a few weeks ago: "The diversity of my audience will be my downfall." And it still stands true. That's why I've been reduced to these short snappy gimmick updates.   Also, in terms of aesthetics, my blog "looks" better then I have nice plump splotches of text as opposed to these assorted bits and pieces. But hey, that's just what I'm gonna do and there's nothing you can do about it! HMPH.

      Got four and a half hours of sleep, turned in my junior paper, visited and spoke with a man who will most likely die in the coming weeks, and went to Powells Beaverton.   Oh and I also saw a tree. A frail and weak tree. An singularistic tree. It was missing a few branches. On one side, it had the f-word carved into it. It made me realize, we can't all be beautiful. Here was a tree dealing with what life had dealt it the best way it knew how, by soaking up the rays of the sun and continuing to grow. I think the weakerthans said it best when they said "drowning in the pools of other lives". That means so much. When I looked outside, I saw all the ugliness in the world, and then looked in the mirror. A tear was running down my ugly face. I am beautiful. You will know the power of my wind. I will topple the highest phone poles with my love. I hope these words will serve as an inspiration to all of you. The tree may have been missing its branches but with this blog, perhaps I can extend my own branches of wisdom to other frail and lonely trees, lost and seeking their own identities in this superificial and transient world.   Yes my sweets, together we can overcome any adversity and hardship. Together, we can move mountains.  Hahhaaha.   That was awkward. I can't believe some people took it seriously. Just in case some of you didn't ge tit, I was satirizing hyper-introversion. You know, pretentious fuckers who read Catcher in the Rye and think that suddenly they understand the entire world.  I guess the dying man part thing might've led people to assume that this was gonna be a somber/serious entry. Well it wasn't. I guess it was kinda tasteless of me to mention a dying man and some silly story like that in the same entry. And I hope the "ugly face" part didn't convince you it was serious. But yeah, just never take anything I say on the internet seriously and you'll be ok.   In any case, check this baby out:      (let me tell ya, she's soon gonna be mine soon)  Oh and my Junior Paper is finally done. But now begins my history research project. Thesis due monday. Outline next week. Rough draft the week after that. And next week is also SATs. And the week after that is also AP exams. It just doesn't end. I've also gotta do my Christian Service and write that paper. Anyway, I think I'm gonna go do some SAT studying.

      The following is something I wrote a few months ago but thought it would be timely to reprint. Maybe it's because I want to show all the immitators (I've seen three or four blogs start in the past few weeks from people I know!) how and why those of us who are vets in the blogging industry do what we do. Damn kids these days with their..their...hula hoops and rock music, I'll show 'em!! Or maybe it's just because all my content has been so lamentable lately I need to recycle some old gems and wallow in my past "accomplishments". You see, I'm going through a mid life crisis of sorts. Or a mid-career crisis. That's actually exactly what's going on. Jeez Shakeer, nice work there. He shoots he scores!  But yeah, why do I keep a blog?  Thats a good question. I guess writing and being published like this is a sort of primal verification: I am published, therefore I exist. A distinct part of exists and appears somewhere beyond myself. My thoughts aren't just stuck inside my muddled head, they're out in the real world being read, appreciated, or even just acknowledged. I've made my mark on the world and although not a significantly tangible mark, an intristic and personal mark nevertheless. That I guess is the philosophical reason. The more practical reason is well, this is what I do. I like to do it. It might be the norm but I guess its just something I like to do. Don't get me wrong; I don't mean that in the "I'm deviating from the mainstream so I'm cool" way. To me, that sort of thing is a load of bullshit. But I probably shouldn't say that. That would be being judgemental. And shakeer don't like being judgemental. As I was saying, this is just the way I enjoy expressing myself. Different people express themselves in different ways. This way is pretty easy. I don't really have to make much of an effort but I can be heard anyway. Of course, to others updating a website like this may seem like a big waste of time. Well, this is how I like to spend my time thank you very much. How they choose to express themself is different. Its not right and its not wrong. Just different. As I was saying though, this way is pretty easy. I don't have to show up and do anything or impress anyone. All I have to do is type up some shit and press post. And I must say, it's pretty gratifying. I mean, unlike people who choose to express themselves more openly, I don't need to worry about hearing the boos. I don't have to deal with someone's dissatisfaction in my face. Yeah, I guess in that regard, its a pretty cowardly thing to do (writing a journal like such) but I can live with that.   That's it. So anyway, I just signed up for a Google mail account (gmail) All you folks can't sign up for it yet, it's beta. Only I can. Cuz I'm cool like that. Canttouchdis' y0. Okay. So I was thinking of picking up a cheap domain name (again). Here's what I've got so far in terms of creative titles: www.a-gosh-amongst-men.com, www.wearing-socks-with-sandals.com, and uhh yeah that's about it. In terms of non-creative titles I've got shakeer.com, shakeer.org, or uhm shakeersblog.com.  Speaking of creative, check out this shirt design I've made:    ( urlLink Click for a bigger version. )  It's like those stupid "EVERYBODY LOVES A JEWISH GIRL"/"EVERYBODY LOVES AN ITALIAN BOY" shirts they have at Urban Outfitters. They didn't have a brown boy version. I checked. Maybe when I get some time I'll make this and distribute it to fellow members of my race. I might even include yellow folk too with a version for them. Oh and I bought a new watch. It's a Cat in the Hat watch. Cost me a fortune. $1.99. But let me tell ya, it was worth every last dollar. You see, it's got four changable faceplates. Not one. Not two. Not three. FOUR. Be sure to come by some day and check it out. I may let you have a peek.   Okay boys and girls, thats all for now. Before I go, I'll do one of those "now listening to" things. Except since I understand that all of you live busy lives I'll just list the bands that are topping the playlists this week: The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Dandy Warhols, The Flaming Lips, Interpol,  Joy Division, The Kinks, Modest Mouse, Neutral Milk Hotel, Pearl Jam, Phish, Radiohead, The Replacements, The Smiths, and The Velvet Underground.

      My proverbial biting-social-commentary well has run dry. And since I still have to continue to deliver dynamic content on deadline, I guess I'll have to resort to my backup routine:  Just flew in from New York last night, did you know my agent booked me on a flight to Porltand Maine? I'm like UHH THATS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COUNTRY. But it's okay, he's a nice guy, nice guy. So I was just at the supermarket last week and noticed that hot dogs come in bags of 10 and buns come in bags of 8. WHATS UP WITH THAT? What are you supposed to do with the two extra buns? Anyway, so my wife wants me to go on the Atkins diet. Atkins: whats up with that? I mean, you eat all the meat you want and no vegetables or bread? Great idea, that sounds exactly like the diet I've got going now!! *buh-dum-tsh* I kid, I kid, so have you guys seen any of those reality sho- whats that? My times up? Okay then. Make sure to try the chicken wings...and don't forget to tip your waitress!  Okay nevermind, I guess I have no choice but to do what all the newspaper comicstrip artists have been doing for years: recycling old jokes and exploiting common stereotypes/"ironies":    ( urlLink Click here for a bigger version of the picture. )  No? Okay then, maybe I should do what all the comic artists are doing these days and start talking about political issues and/or Iraq since we all know that people would rather get their war news from three pannel comic trips that feature talking animals then the rest of the newspaper they're holding in their hand (these are both from just today):    ( urlLink Click here for a bigger version of the picture. )    ( urlLink Click here for a bigger version of the picture. )    ok seriously i got nothing. maybe i should just resort to self-depreciating racial humor and/or the typical bitching stuff that would be more effective if yelled on a street corner.

      That, for those that don't know, is my English teacher. And if you don't know her, you probably don't need to read it. Anyway, I'm emailing it to her anonymously tommorow during 3rd period (so right before our class). She's always checking her email during class so hopefully she'll find it and read it to us. Hopefully she'll go berserk:  To Mrs. Festine,  I don't know what you're doing but my daughter has been up late into the night (way past her bedtime) for a number of days in the past week or so working on the enormous English paper you have assigned her. She has been complaining incessantly about her workload and although I will admit that other classes (as well as her holy week obligations) might have had something to do with it, you seem to be at the center of her complaints. She's only a teenager and she definatively doesn't deserve to be overworked like this. Just in the past week, I've had to drive her to two different libraries to get research materials for this project. What do you hope to accomplish by pushing your students this far? Why do they need to spend this much time outside of school and at other facilities doing work for this project if we're paying thousands of dollars worth of tution every year to send her to school? Why don't you help your students and let them work in class instead of forcing them to spend countless hours slaving away at home?   I'm usually not one to complain about my children having to do lots of work but there has to be a limit. And guess what: one of the reasons she tells me she's working so hard on this is that your class is the one she's struggling most in. I don't see how someone who works so hard can struggle though. And I don't see how you can expect your students to get that much work done in the course of two or so weeks. My daughter has been getting As for all her life. How can she be getting a B in English? She can speak English. She can write well. She works hard. We pay thousands of dollars. Also, she's only a little girl. She's not cut out for this kind of work. Just lighten up on her, willya? I mean, she's a girl.   Just let me tell you though, she worked obscenely hard and it's your fault (you could've at least assigned the project more then a few weeks ago). After that much work, if she doesn't get an A this semester, I most definately will not be pleased. This time I'm only emailing you. Next time I might have to email your supervisors. This sort of thing will not stand.  Sincerely, Michael Bukowski  Her reaction will be golden.   Also, go see Proof. It was great.   Oh and Brian Seo tried to hijack my blog by posting a satire of one of those pointless anecdotes I've been writing lately (Manny, the glasses, the bicycle (which most critics agree, is the best of the bunch (although its a shame that few have read it (hint hint)))). It's actually really funny. I got rid of it from here but make sure to go check it out on  urlLink his blog .

      I was just crusing some political forums on the internet and came across a transcript for a speech from the upcoming presedential elections. I contacted the campaign headquarters and they asked me to post it on the blog. It's actually a really good speech and well, I was pretty undecided about where to put my vote before (all that partisan bickering and negative campaigning was too much for me...also, my favorite candidate was eliminated in the primaries) but now I'm pretty sure. So without further ado,  urlLink here it is .

      Apparanty, it's gonna include Morrissey, Modest Mouse, Sonic Youth, The Flaming Lips, possibly Interpol, and a bunch of other great bands! Those are some of my favoritest bands. This could very well be the coolest concert/festival to hit Portland, if it does! Oh and they're also reducing ticket prices this year which is good since the tickets for a festival with that many big names would obviously be pretty pricey. And they're hitting 20 cities, so Portland will probably be one. I hope. Or at least Seattle. I would kill to go to that concert. I'm excited. Real excited. I need to let others know about this so I think I'll post a blog entry about it. Yeah!

      You see, I was just walkin down the hallway mindin my own business when suddenly these two big numbskulls jump outta nowhere and grab my brand new glasses. I didn't want no trouble so I was just like all OKAY VERY FUNNY GUYS GIVE EM BACK. Then I grabbed for em but the one on the left just tossed it over to his partner in CRIME. I lunged in the other direction but then the other guy tossed it back too. This wont on for like five or so more tosses. At this point I had enough so I was like all QUIT IT YOU GUYS GIVE IT BAAAAACK but they just shoved me into the drinking fountain. He was about to turn it on and drench me in water but then Mr. Kloser came in and told them to knock it off. Let me tell ya though, if it weren't for Mr. Kloser coming to my rescue, I woulda been stuck in a locker that afternoon.

       To the people who fired Bob Edwards for being too old to attract younger listeners to National Public Radio, listen to this: I'm 16 years old and I don't think Bob Edwards is the reason that many youth don't care about current events. In fact, I have a number of high school friends who listen to him every morning on their ways to school. I've tried the "hipper" talk-radio stations and concluded that nothing compares to the way Bob Edwards manages to make the news legitimate and appealing. I've heard accounts from his older fans explaining how, after listening to the show for years, they have trouble imagining anyone but him hosting the show. Although for me that period of time isn't nearly as long, I can't help but agree.    Also: although I said I gave talk radio a try and didn't like it much, it's not really true. I did give KPOJ (Air America) a try the other day and found it pretty interesting. A bit too far left yes (then again, I read Adbusters magazine so...), but an interesting alternate perspective nevertheless. I'll definately listen to it when NPR starts getting boring.

      I know was watching it for you until you came back on the twenty seventh but I guess I didn't do such a good job. I assure you though, I was feeling pretty sorry and I spent all morning grieving. Everybody's saying that you'll take the news gracefully but somehow, I don't think I'll be getting off that easily. You see, I meant her no harm when I left her unlocked outside the corner shop. I was just running in, didn't think I'd be that long. I came back, she was gone and all that was there was some bored old dog, leashed up to the place where your bicycle had been. I guess we'll never see poor Susan again. Let this be consolation, that all the while you were in Maui, I treated her with care and respect and gave her lots of love, and I was usually pretty good 'bout locking her up. Where has she gone? Well, I bet she's on the bottom of the ol' duck pond, rudely abused on some heshner's joy ride. So yeah, I wrote you this apology in the hopes that you'd forgive me even though it was wrong, being so careless with a thing so great and taking your poor Madeline away.

      1. Click the above.  2. Download it all.   3. Enjoy.  (I cannot stress the importance of steps 1-2 enough. This is awesome music. Yes, its wierd. Yes, its "gay". Yes, its like nothing you've heard before. But it's also lovely. And endearing. And legal. So acquire 'em now. Oh and keep in mind that those are all live tracks so they sound somewhat crappier then the real thing. If you succesfully complete step 3, talk to me, and I'll hook you up with the actual album. I've got it all.)   (If you're concerned about bandwidth, they look like they're going from best to worst. Sort of. So just start at the top and work your way down. You should be ok that way.)

      I've decided to compile a list of my 20 favorite albums of the past 20 years for a number of reasons: -Making lists is fun -Proliferation of music is cool -I've always been meaning to make a list of best albums of like forever but like the classics from the 60s and 70s always bog me down -Making lists is fun  Here it is. (It's in order, obviously, but the ordering isn't completely accurate. Also, the lower you get, the less accurate it gets. Also, alot of the albums at the bottom could be exchanged for other albums. Also, alotta bands have more then one album that deserves to be there but I didn't include both or whatever on purpose. Also, some bands have alotta good singles and I like them alot but I didn't really think they had a good album that I wanted to choose. An example that comes to mind is Pearl Jam. I guess The Smiths would fall into that category too but The Queen is Dead is inarguably my favorite album of all time and I guess the tragedy with them isn't my "only pick good ALBUMS not SINGLES or BANDS" rule as much as it is my "only pick one album" rule. Okay, I'll shut up and get to the list now.)  1.   The Smiths  The Queen Is Dead  2.   Pixies  Doolittle  3.   Radiohead  Kid A  4.   Sonic Youth  Daydream Nation  5.   My Bloody Valentine  Loveless  6.   Belle & Sebastian  If You're Feeling Sinister  7.   Wilco  Yankee Hotel Foxtrot  8.   Modest Mouse  The Lonesome Crowded West  9.   U2  The Joshua Tree  10.   Nirvana  Nevermind  11.   Neutral Milk Hotel  In the Aeroplane Over the Sea  12.   The Shins  Chutes Too Narrow  13.   Interpol  Turn on the Bright Lights  14.   Beastie Boys  Licensed to Ill   15.   The Unicorns  Who Will Cut Our Hair When We're Gone  16.   The Flaming Lips  The Soft Bulletin  17.  The Postal Service  Give Up  18.   Pavement  Slanted & Enchanted  19.   Of Montreal  Satanic Panic in the Attic  20.  Coldplay  Parachutes

      Last night, I went to The Decemberists show downtown. It was at the Aladdin theater on the east side (you know, the shitty side). Never having really experienced professional live rock music like this, I had little idea what to expect. From what I'd heard, the band was supposed to be absolutely fucking amazing live. And guess what. They were. I was pretty fond of their music before but didn't think way too much of it. Their music is okay but live, they were perfect.   Anyway, so we got there pretty early and after a while, the first warm up band, The Places, came on. They really sucked and were a complete waste of time. After them, The Long Winters did another opening act and were actually pretty good, nothing amazing, but you could tell they were talented but perhaps not that exciting live. The frontman for The Long Winters was pretty cool though. Once he asked for requests at the end of their setlist and while everyone was yelling out songs, I yelled a request for The Decemberists. The few people around me who heard laughed.   But yeah, then came The Decemberists. They delivered quite a performance and not only was their music great, they were pretty fun and interesting as well. Colin Meloy is a charismatic, talented, and undeniably dreamy frontman, the fat bassist is hilarious, and the wierd trollish lady that plays the accordian and sometimes keyboards is uhm, interesting. At one point the three of them did this really cool duel which was pretty entertaining. In any case, we had to leave early (at 11) but they finished their set right before we had to go. It was fantastic timing. But then they came back on stage and did some extra stuff (I think they may have started taking requests). As we were leaving, they began playing The Tain which would've been awesome to hear since its like 18 minutes long. Meh. Next time.   My only other complaint would be our seats. Most people went up to in front of the stage during The Long Winters so they got to stay there and rock out during the Decemberists but we stayed in our seats. Later, those people were blocking our view so we moved up to the viewing gallery up above. Those seats offered a good view but the atmosphere just wasn't as cool as being down below so later during the Decemberists setlist, we went back down and tried to stand at the back of the crowd. We could see okay but it would've been cooler if we'd been up front and since we'd come so early, we probably should've used that to our advantage to get to the front. Whatever though, we weren't really familiar with rock concert etiquette so it's all good. Besides, this complanit isn't even a really big one and I'm just being too nitpicky.  In any case, Brian Seo also went and he took a bunch of photos. I picked a few of them and uploaded them; you can view them  urlLink here . Check them out, they're pretty good. Oh and I also scored myself some stickers, a little lapel pin, and  urlLink this tshirt  (isn't "The 'Never Send To Know With Whom The Van Rolls, It Rolls With Thee' Tour 2004" just the greatest name for a tour you've ever heard?). Good stuff.

      (Click the title above for the trailer. Watch and weep my friends, watch and weep.)   Allow me to break it down. The movie has all the neccesary elements for a shitty "urban" (read: black people) comedy: - No plot whatsoever  - Break-dancing - Inordinate amounts of chrome/"bling" (the airplane has rims...) - Hydraulics (EXCEPT NOW ITS ON A FUCKING AIRPLANE) - The token lame white guy who has no idea what's going on  - The cool white guy who is down with it  - The fat black woman who waves her finger and acts sassy for no apparant reason (her name in the movie JAMAQUIA, no joke) - The slutty/innocent white woman (Brook Shields) - Method Man and Snoop Dogg (both mandatory actors in shitty movies like this) - Endless drug references  Man, I think its time for another Spike Lee Joint.

      (For some reason, much of my content as of late has been awfully political...whatever, its better then being awfully awful.)  Anyway, here are some excerpts from each of their speeches about the current situation in Iraq:  "Like you, I have been disgraced about what I've seen on TV that took place in prison." —George W. Bush, Parkersburg, West Virginia, May 13, 2004   "Dominance is not really a strategic policy or political philosophy at all. It is a seductive illusion that tempts the powerful to satiate their hunger for more power still by striking a Faustian bargain. And as always happens - sooner or later - to those who shake hands with the devil, they find out too late that what they have given up in the bargain is their soul." -Al Gore, New York City, New York, May 26, 2004

      The South. Like that whole area. Especially South Carolina. Fucking South Carolina started the Civil War and has always been causing trouble. And they're so backwards and shit. :ook what they're up to now:   urlLink http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=38571   :|  But then again, a succession and stuff sure would be cool as hell. I mean, you have to admit, cool shit like that never happens anymore and a little constitutional controversy would sure liven stuff up a little, huh?

      Yeah, neither have I. I plan to do so this summer though. If you're at all interested in political science, apparantly it's an awesome read.  Anyway, I was reading a summary of one of the subplots and I happened to make a really profound connection with whats going on in Iraq now. Well I thought it was profound. But thats just me. Okay, you see, the book is about a Roman duke who is having problems with civil unrest. One day, he puts this man named Messer Ramiro d'Orco into power as a governor in the unruly province to alleviate the unrest but this d'Orco guy, who is described as swift and cruel, manages to restore authority at the price of causing widespread outrage at the government. As a result, in an attempt to distance himself from d'Orco, the duke stages a show trial and sentences the an to death. He then has him brutally executed in public and attempts to thus satiate the people's resentmen.   So, where am I going with this? The last three US military invasions (if you ignore Bosnia, that is), were actions where the US publically attempted to bring down people they had formerly either put into power or helped keep in power: Noriega, Bin Laden, and Hussein.  Macchiaveli is a fucking genius.

      I haven't done a "hey this is everything I did today" post in a long time and seeing as how I've got two finals and a bunch of homework for tommorow, this sounds a splendid time for one. Okay, so nothing really out of the ordinary happened at school today. Well, one thing happened. And now that you mention it, it was pretty out of the ordinary. You see, Mr. Mike Simons had the greatest Freudian Slip today. Okay, so we were talking about what characteristics of the Twenties gave the period its "Roaring" reputation. He was asking us for some and we came up with the usual (Jazz, speakeasies, flappers, spectator sports, Hollywood) but for some reason, Mr. Simons wasn't content. He wanted one more and he was intent on squeezing it out of us. He pushed on and we kept supplying him with stuff ("Leisurely automibile drives?") but that wasn't it. Of course, by now, we pretty much knew what this last one was gonna be (Oh Simons, you dirty old man!) but no one could bring themselves to say it. So he finally said it: "And of course, FREE SEX!! Well not free but..." With the class at a loss for a response, Mr. Simons decided he ought to propell the situation into further awkwardness. He continued his lecture with, "Oh yeah, and the thing about that was that cars were starting to become cheaper and more popular. And funny thing is, they even used cars for sex in those days...some called cars rolling houses of prostitution...you see, they'd just come out with the HARDCORE...uhh I mean hardtop." He shuffled and rushed to correct himself, realizing what he had just said as the class shared awkward glances and muffled laughs. It took a few moments to sink in but as Mr. Simons tried to continue his lecture pretending that nothing had happened, the laughter spread and increased. Some of us couldn't believe that just happened because when you think about it, its a pretty peculiar situation to be in. I mean, for him to have said that like that, he obviously has been exposed to the word alot. Now, the only way someone would relate the words hardcore and sex (or the only way one would use the word harcore nowadays really) would be if they were big fans of porn. And the thing is, even if this had nothing to do with porn and was an honest mistake, it's not like he could say, "No guys, I don't look at porn, its not what you think, seriously!!!" So he was pretty much screwed. Classic Freudin slip. Good times.  Yeah, I guess you kinda had to be there. But Mr. Simons is such a geezer. I mean, he's the man and all, but he tries so hard to be cool with the kids (remember the "Big Dog" dance?). Another time I remember he was telling us about how during the GIlded Age, politicians were widely revered and respected. He explained how they would travel around the country to be met with public delight and accolades. People would flock in the thousands to attend their speeches and Mike went on to compare their social statuses with those of modern rock stars. As if we needed for him to reinforce this hypothesis, he decided that his claim needed to be backed up with some sort of concrete evidence and thus contined with, "Yeah, like rock stars...you know like the...well, what are some big rock bands these days?" The responses were characteristically muffled and scattered so unsatifisfied, Mike concluded the discussion with "Oh yeah yeah, those are good but I was thinking more along the lines of Def Leppard and Limp Bizkit." WTF? How oh how did he come up with those two bands and how did he manage to link them. I mean, Limp Bizkit isn't even heavy metal...how the hell would he even know Limp Bizkit though. It was so wierd. But yeah. Another time, he was telling us about Vaudevilles and commented that although they didn't have stuff like that anymore, back when he was a kid, they'd sometimes have "variety" shows on TV. Some kid raised his hand and asked if the shows were like modern shows like The Steve Harvey Show on WB and Mike responded with "Steve Harvey huh, I've never seen that one." OF COURSE YOU'VE NEVER SEEN "THAT ONE" MR. SIMONS, YOU'RE OLD AND LAME. Guh. Okay, I'm sounding stupid.   I spent alot of time working the ol' cube today (read the ode below). I also went to Powells and bought three Dr. Seuss books (including "You're Only Old Once" for Mrs. Festine), netting myself an AWESOME Dr. Seuss waterbottle. It's awesome. Trust me. I'll make sure fill it to the Gerald McBoing Boing and bring it into school tommorow. I also noticed this cool-looking Albert Einstein action figure and couldn't resist buying it. I just looked at it and though, "damn, that's so something I'd buy" just like I sometimes say "damn, that's so something that so and so would buy". But this time it was about me. I guess I let the filthy capitalist pig get the best of me—it's ironic because the next thing I bought was a copy of the activitist/dirty liberal/extremist rag, Adbusters magazine. If you're not familiar with the magazine, their slogan is "CULTURAL REVOLUTION IS OUR BUSINESS" and their mission statement is as follows:  "We are a loose global network of artists, writers, environmentalists, ecological economists, media-literacy teachers, reborn Lefties, ecofeminists, downshifters, high school shit-disturbers, campus rabble-rousers, incorrigibles, malcontents and green entrepreneurs. We are idealists, anarchists, guerrilla tacticians, pranksters, neo-Luddites, poets, philosophers and punks. Our aim is to topple existing power structures and forge a major rethinking of the way we will live in the 21st century. We want to change the way information flows, the way institutions wield power, the way the world keeps the peace, the way the food, fashion, automobile, sports, music and culture industries set their agendas. Above all, we want to change the way we interact with the mass media and the way in which meaning is produced in our society."  Yeah. Woaaah... But yeah, I just like reading it for the pretty pictures and interesting perspective on issues, thasall. Anyway, yeah, so then as I left and started making my way back to the Max stop, I noticed this cool looking record store and went in for a visit. It was awesome. I met all the indie bands that I'd previously known only on the internet in the forms of records and posters. I was thoroughly impressed and lingered around for a good ten minutes. Then I realized I ought to be getting home quickly and did so. But still, this is more downtown that I'll have to explore this summer when I'm working at Pop Art. I'm working pretty close to Powells so it's gonna be awesome. I can't wait.  I also can't wait for the Decemberists concert. It's this Thursday. It's gonna be offdahook. You just wait.    ps. On the way back on the Max, I came up with this wonderful new title for the blog. It's genius, I think. But thats just me. You see, it has a number of meanings. First of all, you know the term starving artist, right? It basically implies that artists are never ones to make too much money and due to the nature of their profession, are constantly finding themselves in debt or without money—or starving. Me though, I'm starving rightfully. I'm starving for a reason: namely, that my "art" sucks. Oh and I'm also starving since I'm so skinny and eat so little. Yeah. Clever huh.

      For Calculus, we have to ride Odes to our Rubik's Cube. The following is my ode.   She has been a test of the capabilities and pressures of my mind, my soul, my body—a crucible ordered down from the mightiest and wisest to measure my limits: spiritually, physically, psychologically, agriculturally, ergonomically, aesthetically. She has been a duel. A process. A struggle. An experience. A struggle. Like a modern day Helen of Troy, just one her six faces has launched a thousand ships. She has sent millions of my precious seconds to their demises. She has caused worlds to collide. Rivalries to form. Sensibility and desire have fought for control sleepless night after night. Aspiration and inevitably have warred bitterly and disastrously. Efficiency and style have endured a long duel for my sponsoring. And these, I warn you, are only the internal struggles. The external struggles have been far more devastating. She has wrought destruction and separation amongst the closest of friends, the most cordial of allies, and the most trusting of comrades. She has created in the hearts of her victims hate, frustration, and cynicism. Failure after failure, her subjects have questioned their very existences. If we can not even conquer her, what can we do? And what do we do? And why do we do it? What, if anything at all, does it mean to be anything at all? With tactics and weapons such as this, she has tormented, tortured, and broken anyone who has shown even the slightest bit of interest in her.  She lures in her victims, convinces them of their invincibility with her occasional but intentional easy Down Plus Signs, already Oriented Up Corners, and most devious of all, her pre-aligned Final Two Edges. Once she has her subjects adequately trapped in her grips, she disillusions and tortures them with failed Step Sevens, critical errors, and worst of all, MID-PROCEDURE CUBE JAMS! Oh, how I abhorred those cube jams. Those jams, they pushed me to the edges of my sanity. I could handle the skill and patience required to master the necessary techniques and methods, but once my intelligence and reason has been pushed to such unimaginable limits, a simple nudge from a frustrating cube jam is enough to push me over the edge into the abyss of insanity.   But I sit here not to complain of my struggles. No, the concern of this ode is not me. It concerns a certain cube and a certain you: the you that might be brave and foolish enough to believe that embarking on a similar expedition into the depths and far reaches of everything that is her is a fine idea. It isn’t. I assure you my friend, it most definitely isn’t. Do not do it. Throw her into a rapidly flowing river. Step away. Back out slowly. RUN. RUN LIKE YOU’VE NEVER RUN BEFORE. RUN LIKE YOU’LL NEVER RUN AGAIN. RUN FOR EVERYTHING THAT IS SACRED, GOOD, AND TASTY IN THIS WORLD.   Please heed my warnings. For your own safety. I wouldn't wish her wrath upon anyone. To others who plan to embark on a similar quest to conquer and ravage her thoroughly and wholly, I have only one bit of wisdom: get out of this while you still can. Save yourselves. She is cruel. She is devious. She is merciless. I refuse to allow her to slay another innocent individual. She is by no means worth the toil and sacrifice. Think of your mothers. Your families. Your friends. Do you dare risk having them weep as a result of your pride and arrogance? Not only is she capable of bringing ruin to both your mind and body, she will devastate to those you love and care for. She is unforgiving and corrupting. She is the embodiment of everything evil and wrong in this world. Avoid her.   Yet to be fair I also must speak of the wonder and magnificence of her bounties. To those brave and tireless enough to pursue her and for those wise and patient enough to complete her, you are in for a truly remarkable feeling. As the pieces fall into perfect alignment, as you reach the fruit of your toil, as you prepare to join the ranks of an elite few, you will experience a status and a sensation experienced by only the most respected and luckiest of our world. And my friend, let me tell you: from that point, it only gets better. Your times only get shorter. Each solve only gets sweeter. You will know what it means to be beyond this earth. You too, will feel the almost intrinsic inclination to proudly brandish the cube high above your head and firmly slap it down on whatever flat surface you may find near. For you, she will no longer be a symbol of pain and toil, but rather of pride and accomplishment. For those around you, she will be a symbol of envy and aspiration. With your selfish and arrogant act of plucking her bounty for yourself, you have driven countless other youths to their own destructions as they dedicate themselves to a similar feat. Little do they know the toil and sacrifice you put in for what seems to be an easy accomplishment.   For if you solve her, you truly are glorious. You truly have exceeded the ranks of ordinary men and entered into the realm of the spiritual. For you, all of life’s doors are now open. For you, any mountain is conquerable, any dream attainable, any goal accomplishable. Walk with increased vigor and swagger my son, for you deserve the accolades and praise that those who cannot begin to comprehend your glory will shower upon you. You have confirmed your identity, you have made your mark upon the world, you have left a legacy that will never be forgotten. You have conquered the unconquerable. You can solve a cube in a time faster then a time ordinarily associated with solving something that takes less time to solve then a cube.   You can cube. And therefore, you are.

      Okay, so this farmer walks into a bar—oh wait, might've been a supermarket. And come to think of it, it may have not been a farmer. Could've been a banker. Wait, that doesn't sound right either. Hmm, whatever, so this guy walks into the bar. Or supermarket. One of the two. He's walking into something. And he sees this other guy, and he knows him pretty well from before. Not really well but he kind of knows him. So then the guy says the funniest thing to him. I forget what it was but it was really funny. The other guy laughed. It as the funniest thing ever, I wish I could remember it. Trust me though, it was hilarious, what he said.

      Purely in the interest of scienctific advancement, some person on the internet (I just got it in an email) decided to replace the word wand with the word wang at various occurances of the former in the Harry Potter books. The following are his conclusions:   "Why aren't you supposed to do magic?" asked Harry. "Oh, well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wang in half an' everything  A magic wang... this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.  "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter." It wasn't a question. "You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was in here herself, buying her first wang. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wang for charm work." "Your father, on the other hand, favored a mahogany wang. Eleven inches. "  Harry took the wang. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wang above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold sparks shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls  "Oh, move over," Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wang, tapped the lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!"  The troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose, and Harry's wang had still been in his hand when he'd jumped - it had gone straight up one of the troll's nostrils.  He bent down and pulled his wang out of the troll's nose. It was covered in what looked like lumpy gray glue.  He ran onto the field as you fell, waved his wang, and you sort of slowed down before you hit the ground. Then he whirled his wang at the dementors. Shot silver stuff at them.   "Yes," Harry said, gripping his wang very tightly, and moving into the middle of the deserted classroom. He tried to keep his mind on flying, but something else kept intruding.... Any second now, he might hear his mother again... but he shouldn't think that, or he would hear her again, and he didn't want to... or did he? Something silver-white, something enormous, erupted from the end of his wang  Then, with a sigh, he raised his wang and prodded the silvery substance with its tip.  'Get - off - me!' Harry gasped. For a few seconds they struggled, Harry pulling at his uncles sausage-like fingers with his left hand, his right maintaining a firm grip on his raised wang.

      I've decided to do a Song of the Day thing where every day I post about a song. I'll post the lyrics and a link to the mp3 for your listening pleasure. Why? To insure the proliferation of music of course. Music ought to be shared, I think. Information ought to be set free. I'll do it legally though. I'll only post songs that I can find the mp3s of on the band / record company websites.  First song:  urlLink Darts of Pleasure  (right-click save-as, its a 3.16mb) by Franz Ferdinand. Franz Ferdinand is a relatively new Scottish indie band that sounds alot like The Strokes, Interpol, Joy Division, and like most good modern indie, Pixies. So check em out if you like any of those bands or just uhm are interested.   On a related note, I wish I had gone to The Shins concert on Thursday. Of course, seeeing as how I was up 'til like 3:30 working on my history paper and only went to school for like an hour the next day, that probably wouldn'ta worked. But I really regret not going. I've really got into them recently. And by recently, I mean like this weekend. I've had their music for a while but for some reason I really got into em just now. I wasn't too fond of them earlier but I am now. But yeah, I'll stop repeating myself and shut up now.

      Why do more people not complain about the incredible clusterfuck that is our current situation in Iraq?   The more I think about it, the more pissed off I get. So much has gone wrong in Iraq and so much has gone wrong to bring us to where we are now yet people still continue to defend the actions of the administration and their war. That seriously speaks tragically and horrifically of how ignorant, blind, and complacent we Americans are. People still don't get it. The situation in Iraq is fucked up enough. Whats worse is that there are still people in this country insane to defend it. Every time anyone tries to bring up the fact that Iraq is just not working and that this administration is incompetent and useless, we get accused of being un-American or un-patriotic. I hate to make this partisan, but how can conservatives be so fucking naive and idiotic?   I mean look, it's taken one year and over a thousand deaths for us to discover that there were no weapons in Iraq. I remember talking to conservatives during the buildup to the war and constantly getting fed stories and statistics about the horrible stockpiles and weapons programs Saddam had and feeling helpess since you couldn't really argue with information that sounded that concrete. Now though, we can see that that was all bullshit but guess what: it's too late. And whats worse is that if anyone tries to bring it up, we get told that the real reasons weren't those but rather getting rid of Saddam and spreading democracy, freedom, and justice. Of course, as we discover that this prison scandal goes further up then we initially expected, even that doesn't seem to add up. And we just don't get it. Why do they attack us? Why do they hate us?  ...  How can we be so fucking blind? Is it not obvious? Just put yourself in their shoes for a minute and think. They're people too. They can reason too. They're doing what they're doing for a reason. Are they doing what they're doing for the right reasons? Perhaps not. But does that mean that since we oppose them, our reasons are right? Hardly.   But let me back up. As I was saying, we obviously went in there under false pretenses. We were obviously categorically and systematically lied to. I mean, this administration somehow managed to convince us that Iraq, a country that had neither done anything to us in years nor possessed the capability to do so, was suddenly the #1 security threat to not only the United States, but the rest of that region. How did they do it? They lied. They fucking lied. And they knew they were lying too.   As its now becoming apparant, the US got most of its intelligence from Ahmed Chalabi and his band of intelligence manufacturing Iraqi exiles. As its also now becoming apparant, this government KNEW that Chalabi was trying to selling us false intelligence. In fact, the Bush administration attempted to make it so they could get the intelligence straight from Chalabi and avoid the analysts over at the CIA and the State Department. Why? Because they knew it was all bullshit, thats why. And guess what. Who does Chalabi seem to be loyal to? Iran. And guess what else. While Saddam wasn't really much of a threat to US at all, Iran was. Iran happens to be the home of the root of Islamic fundamentalist terror. The Iranian government activaly backs Palestinian terrorists. The Iranian was behind the Khobart towers' bombing. The Iranian government has been trying to develop a nuclear weapons program for years. Hell, Iran is even in the fucking "axis of evil". And what we're doing now is installing a pro-Iranian Shi-ite government in Iraq. In fact, Colin Powell recently announced that a theocracy is now acceptable in Iraq. A theocracy. Just like Iran. From the looks of it, the Iranian government has managed to dupe the greatest and most powerful nation in the world to expend millions of dollars and over a thousand innocent lives to topple a government it didn't like.   And don't tell me they took advantage of us. Don't tell me we're the victims here. Because we knew. We were warned. As I said, the State Department and the CIA knew they were lying. And don't tell me that we didn't know better. Because we did. We were warned. We might have been pulling information out of our asses but you know who actually knew the situation in Iraq? The United Nations. Why? Because unlike us and our billion dollar satellites, they actually had men on the ground. Gathering intelligence. Inspecting weapons. And what did they tell us? That Iraq had dismantled its weapons program just like they told us they would. As much as you might hate the UN, they're good at finding stuff out. They're good at inspecting stuff. We might be fucking brilliant and blowing shit up and toppling governments in a jiffy, but when it comes to resolving geopolitical struggles and gathering unbiased intelligence, no one beats the United Nations. But we were too blind to recognize that. We were convinced that they were lying to us. We were convinced that our intelligence was spot-on. Colin Powell was convinced that somehow this nondescript rectangular building he was looking at in his overhead sattelite photos housed illegal chemical weapons factories underneath him. Colin Powell was somehow convinced that this vial he was holding in his hand contained anthrax and that that anthrax came straight out Iraq. Well guess what Mr. Powell, Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld, and the rest of the fucking right wing political machine it didn't. You were wrong. You had no idea what you were talking about. And don't tell us you didn't know. Because you did. The UN told you. The rest of the world told you. The American public told you. Everyone else knew. And everyone tried to warn you. Everyone else tried to tell you not to go to war.   Hell Mr. Powell,  I  knew. And I tried to warn you. But you and the rest of conservative America were convinced that Iraq was a grave and gathering threat. You tried to win us over with your empty patriotic rhetoric but it didn't work. We continued to warn you.   When the rest of the world disagrees with you, that doesn't mean you're right and you're noble. It means that you're wrong. I understand that sometimes nations and invidivuals need to stand up for themselves but in the complex world of modern geopolitics, you can't always be right. You can always be powerful. You can always be rich. But you can't always be omniscient. No matter how noble our intentions may be, you CAN NOT be unilateral in a situation like this. You need to listen to the rest of the world. You need to listen to the governing bodies that the rest of the world has established to insure peace and understanding. Most importantly though, you NEED to listen to your own people. "America doesn't need a permission slip from the rest of the world to defend itself," proclaimed Bush in the State of the Union. Yes Mr. President, and apparantly she doesn't need a permission slip from her own people either.   So what am I saying here? I'm saying that this wasn't a mere "intelligence failure". This was categorical and systematic lying. WE WERE LIED TO. Consciously and actively. We've seen what the administration is willing to do to get what they want. We've seen them treasonously expose the names of undercover CIA agents just because their family members spoke out against the actions of the administrtion (family members who were sent by the administration to investigate the very thing they were reporting when they spoke out). Whats worst though that people out there continue to support them. People out there continue to defend them. There's NO ACCOUNTABLITY anymore. Anyone who disagrees is wrong. There is no other side. There is no dissent. You're either with them, or you're against them. And they can never be wrong.   Well guess what Mr. President: you WERE wrong. And guess what else, Mr. President: lots of American soldiers are going to die now in Iraq because of it. But you'll never see that. You'll remain convinced that you're right.   In  Breakfast of Champions , Kurt Vonnegut wrote, “We are healthy only to the extent that our ideas are sane”. With that single line, Vonnegut typified the tragedy of our society by explaining that no matter how insane, destructive, or arrogant we may be, at the end of the day we have the capabality of justifying our actions by labelling our own ideas sane, helpful, and most tragically, the truth.

      I just watched (no really) the documentary Fog of War. The film (yeah, thats right, I said film, not movie) follows American foreign policy through the last sixty or so years through the eyes of Robert S. McNamara , former US Secretary of Defense, President of the Ford Motor Company, and President of the World Bank. It is one of the most intriguing and interesting documentaries I have ever seen and offers quite an insight into the nature of war, politics, and America's relation with the rest of the world. Not only does the film serve to educate and entertain, it served to influence my perspective in several ways. The film revolves mostly around World War II, The Cuban Missile Crisis, and primarily the Vietnam War, but its messages on arms building, war, imperialism, and pacification are strikingly relevant today. What makes his message more credible (obviously) is the fact that the man actually knows what he's talking about. The movie seems to be McNamara's way of preserving his legacy, of explaining his actions, and correcting any misconceptions people may have had about his actions and what went on during his period as Secretary of Defense.   In any case, as I said, he does offer quite a perspective into modern politics and events. Coming from the man that many (seemingly wrongly) blame to be responsible for the Vietnam War, his views on the Iraq war and current American foreign policy are relevant and neccesary. If you care at all about current events, politics, or history, or are just looking for an interesting perspective into American foreign policy, watch this film. Or at least  urlLink watch the trailer .  Or read the following. These are Mr. McNamara's 10 Lessons of War:   1. The human race will not eliminate war in this century, but we can reduce the brutality of war--the level of killing--by adhering to the principles of a "Just War", in particular to the principle of "proportionality".  2. The indefinite combination of human fallibility and nuclear weapons will lead to the destruction of nations.  3. We are the most powerful nation in the world--economically, politically and militarily--and we are likely to remain so for decades ahead. But we are not omniscient.   4. Moral principles are often ambiguous guides to foreign policy and defense policy, but surely we can agree that we should establish as a major goal of U.S. foreign policy and, indeed, of foreign policy across the globe: the avoidance in this century of the carnage--160 million dead--caused by conflict in the 20th century.  5. We, the richest nation in the world, have failed in our responsibility to our own poor and to the disadvantaged across the world to help them advance their welfare in the most fundamental terms of nutrition, literacy, health, and employment.  6. Corporate executives must recognize there is no contradiction between a soft heart and a hard head. Of course, they have responsibities to their employees, their customers and to society as a whole.  7. President Kennedy believed a primary resonsibility of a president--indeed "the" primary responsibility of a president--is to keep the nation out of war, if at all possible.  8. War is a blunt instrument by which to settle disputes between or within nations, and economic sanctions are rarely effective. Therefore, we should build a system of jurisprudence based on the International Court--that the U.S. has refused to support--which would hold individuals responsible for crimes against humanity.  9. If we are to deal effectively with terrorists across the globe, we must develop a sense of empathy--I don't mean "sympathy" but rather "understanding" to counter their attacks on us and the Western World.  10. One of the greatest dangers we face today is the risk of mass destruction as a result of the breakdown of the Non-Proliferation Regime. We--the U.S. are contributing to that breakdown.    According to Mr. McNamara, the Bush Administration has failed each and every one of these tests.

      Yeah, I'm contemplating vegetarianism. I mean, it certainly has its benefits. But it also has its faults. Like for example, you can't eat beef. Oh and: you can't eat chicken. But it's not like I eat alot of either so meh. Still, other then the whole not eating meat part, vegeterianism certainly does seem attractive. Well not really.   Okay look, I was just listening to  Meat is Murder  by The Smiths and it's convinced me to consider vegeterianism. In considering such an option, I put part of the lyrics in my AIM profile. The results were mixed but for the most part hostile. I think I'll just post them here and allow you to evaluate the issue for yourself:  Heifer whines could be human cries Closer comes the screaming knife This beautiful creature must die This beautiful creature must die A death for no reason And death for no reason is MURDER  And the flesh you so fancifully fry Is not succulent, tasty or kind It's death for no reason And death for no reason is MURDER  And the calf that you carve with a smile Is MURDER And the turkey you festively slice Is MURDER Do you know how animals die ?  Kitchen aromas aren't very homely It's not "comforting", cheery or kind It's sizzling blood and the unholy stench Of MURDER  It's not "natural", "normal" or kind The flesh you so fancifully fry The meat in your mouth As you savour the flavour Of MURDER  NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER NO, NO, NO, IT'S MURDER Oh ... and who hears when animals cry ?    DOES THAT CONVINCE YOU? No? It should. Maybe if you heard the song, which is accompanied by screaming animals and razors, you'd know what I mean.   But yeah, it's a good song. That's how a protest song is supposed to be. These days, everyone is making protest songs bitching about some social or political issue. Like for example the Beastie Boys. They're a good band but I have to say that  World Gone Mad  is easily their shittiest song. Most protest songs suck. And whats worse is when shitty bands decide they need to go political. Like Incubus. If you already suck and you produce lyrics like "I dig my toes into the sand / The ocean looks like a thousand diamonds / Strewn across a blue blanket / I lean against the wind / Pretend that I am weightless / And in this moment I am happy / happy", going political is not gonna help. But they do it anyway. If I had my way, the only bands that could produce politically-charged music would be Radiohead and Pearl Jam. Oh and Bob Dylan. But I don't. And saying things like that make me sound like maddox. So I'll stop.   Oh look what song just came up: Marijuana by Phish. :|

      Lately I've been going through a bit of an indie pop phase. You know, a few days go it was old school rap, now its indie pop. Now you might be thinking, "wtf shakeer indie pop ur so pretentious quit trying to categorize music major lamer", but well, you good for nothing heckler, how else do you expect me to explain the genre. Now you're probably thinking "ok wutever dude but isn't indie pop a bit of an oxymoron lol". Well no friend, it isn't. Well it is if you take each of those terms literally but you're not supposed to, ok?? You see, pop doesn't really mean "popular". It's just a kind of sound. So its okay for an "indie" band to be "pop". Well, its not like it isn't okay for an indie band to be "popular", but whatever you know what I mean. Right? No? Ok, lemme just name some bands: Belle & Sebastian, The Postal Service, Death Cab for Cutie, The Microphones, The Unicorns. Yeah. THERE.

      If you had a girlfriend in a coma. Because I mean think about it, you're really into her and suddenly she crashes her car and is in a coma. What do you do then? I mean, do you "dump her" and get a new girlfriend? How would that work? And if you did decide to just abandon her, wouldn't that kind of suck to be her when she wakes up? That'd be awfully awkward. "Oh hi, when did you wake up?!?!!" "Hi honey!" "Yeah...about that..." Or do you wait it out and hope that she gets well soon and once she wakes up, remembers you. Wouldn't that be just an incredibly sucky waste of time? I think so.  SITCOM PLOT!!

      Hey I just got back from the rally. Well not really, its actually the day after. But to add a sense of legitimacy and urgency, I'll make this quick and say that I just got back from it now. So lets pretend I got back now. Okay, so I just got back from the rally. Just in case you didn't know, thats the John Kerry rally. Now the rally itself wasn't that awesome. Kerry himself was kinda lame. He didn't say anything groundbreaking and mostly just bitched about Bush but come to think of it, I guess thats just what you're supposed to do at rallies. The experience itself was fun though. We had to wait in like for like an hour and half and spent most of that time making candid observations about the campaign rally thoroughfare. Lots of crazy Portlanders tend to come out of the woodwork (wtf is the origin of that term) and frequent these events (like that peace rally, err antiwar protest, that I posted about a few weeks ago). I'd say there were like ten to twenty thousand people there (my dad who was passing by the rally from work said that it looked like forty thousand to him) but the newspaper said there were only 8,000. Anyway, as I was saying, there were a buncha whackos there. First of all, there were all the lamer democracts who decided to show up and campaign for tommorow (well actually today)'s local elections. Sometimes  urlLink the candidates themselves  just walked around themselves and told people to vote for them (not that that guy is gonna win anyway...just look at him...he had other supporters too...like  urlLink this hick ). Yeah, like they've really got a fighting chance if the day before the election they're just walking around handing out brochures. Goddamn leeches. Then there were the people who came and rallied for their own causes that had absolutely nothing to do with John Kerry (SAVE THE RAINFOREST!,  urlLink FREE PALESTINE! , ABORTION, ehh I mean  urlLink PRO-CHOICE! ). There were also the idiots who were protesting pretty much everything together. Like  urlLink this guy , I had no idea WTF his point was and what he was trying to prove. The same idiots decide to show up at antiwar protsts as well. There were of course some pretty clever signs too.  urlLink Like this one . I don't know what he's saying but it sure seemed mighty clever. But yeah, the rally itself was pretty cool. After waiting in line for so long (and we probably would not have gotten that far in line had we not found some other Jesuit kids near the front) and trying to catch glimpses at things  urlLink from behind fences , we finally got through the security check (but only after  urlLink this badass looking secret service agent  checked our bags and magnetic wanded us). Just as we were getting in, the convoy began arriving. People started chanting "KER-RY KER-RY KER-RY!" like he was some kind of rock star. Of course, I wasn't here for Kerry. I was here for Howard Dean and fortunately, Howard Dean  urlLink came out first . He  urlLink spoke  for a while and then handed the mic over to  urlLink some fat guy  who gave a wholly uninteresting speech about how Kerry saved him in Vietnam. I really couldn't care less whether or not Kerry went to Vietnam. That was decades ago and his actions on one night in the jungle hardly do anything to convince me that I will agree with him on policy issues. And besides, back when Clinton was running, Kerry himself said that Vietnam should not be an issue and that people should not be using it for political gains. Ahem Mr. Kerry, thats exactly what you're doing right now. Anyway, so with Howard Dean gone I was about to leave though but then I noticed that  urlLink Sean Astin , the guy who played Sam in Lord of the Rings, had showed up too! I had no idea WTF he was up to here but hey, it's Sam, so I stayed. He just kinda stood behind Kerry and swayed back in forth. He didn't say a thing. Just stood there. At least Art Alexakis of Everclear (who also APPARANTLY played at that whole prom thing we had last week, I wasn't there) "entertained" the crowd (I use the word entertain very genereously). Anyway, so I decided to stick around and soon  urlLink Kerry began his speech . True to form, he refused to be firm on anything and just kind of complained about Bush didn't have a plan for this and how the administration screwed up that. He didn't really specify his own plans but I guess its too early for that. Anyway, so he stopped speaking and  urlLink held up hands with Dean , the guy who months ago he was attacking viciously and malaciously. But thats politics. Anyway, Dean made a run for it right afterwards (I guess he was just too cool for the rally) and Kerry began signing autographs and stuff. Naturally, I rushed the stage and pushed my way through many a disgruntled fan to get to  urlLink the front . It was well worth it. I shoved my sign into Mr. Kerry's face and amazingly luckily, he signed it! Here it is:   Pretty cool, huh? Yeah, I was pretty lucky. Anyway, so  urlLink Kerry left  shortly thereafter and the rally came to an end. It was fun.

      (Click the title of the article.)  Its good stuff. Man, I wish I could write this well:   "One of the first things a rock critic learns is not to emphasize the character on the other end of the speakers when reviewing records. This person, who is playing the tunes and singing the songs, isn't to be treated as a performer so much as the instigator of all the terrible/wonderful noise infesting the writer's world, and should be judged accordingly. That is, by the social rules of rock criticism, one shouldn't judge the musicians at all, merely their music-- and even then, only in terms of how it affects the writer, and in turn, how it might do the same for other listeners. The "argument" comes during the moments when you either agree or disagree with the writer's experience.  The next thing writers learn is that just thinking of one's own experience isn't enough, because there's a whole world out there giving clues to the real value of the music. If music "matters," it follows that its impact should be obvious outside the window; "relevance" is paramount at this stage of criticism, though since bitter humility is a daily part of any rock writer's life, it pays to phrase arguments stressing relevance in ways that don't obviously indicate its bias. This kind of criticism may seem harsh (and pretty unrelated to the actual musical experience), but it also shares much with traditional journalistic aims of reporting and immediate interpretation, and as such, is a method emphasized at most mainstream music pubs."

      Okay, so you're reading Shakeer's fanciful tale about his 99% on the Junior Paper, and you're like (ahh shit son! Shakeer is the man), but I'm here to tell you how it really went down.    So, Shakeer and I are sitting around on the thursday night before the Junior paper is due, and we were just playing some Donkey Kong on my N64.  After owning Shakeer, I jumped to my feet and yelled out, "YOU JUST GOT SERVED!" and he's like, "Yea dawg..." and then I was like, "YEA" and he was like, "yea" and then he was like, "wurd."  During our conversation consisting of one letter words we get this frantic phone call from this girl (Avital) who in a frantic stream of words asks us several irrelevant questions that have absolutely nothing to do with Donkey Kong.  I just responded, "Shit" and hung up the phone.   Laughing I asked Shakeer, "I wonder what she wanted?"  "Dude, I don't know, but what I do know is I'm going to own you in the next round!" "Its on! Winner gets my pre-ordered copy of the You Got Served DVD"  After a pitiful battle with Shakeer only getting a banana and a half, we turned off the tube and opened up a couple of brewskies.  "Hey man, when's that paper due?" Shakeer asked as he took a refreshing swig of his O'doul's nonalcoholic beverage.  "I don't know, in a long time,"  "Don't you have to read like a book?"  "How should I know," I said.  The phone rang again, but this time it was...YOUR MOM!  Just kidding it wasn't.  In fact, it was Danielle (one of the worry girls) she was wondering if 25 pages was too long, and if she should dedicate her paper to the trees or all of the unicorns that died from global warming.  Shakeer informed her that she better cut her paper down to 10 pages if she was going to dedicate it to the trees, because 25 pages would destroy too much of the forest.  Good one Shakeer.  He turned to me, "Hey I think that paper is due tomorrow dude."  "Hmm we've still got time."  So we booted up the N64 for another game, and the night grew darker.  To be continued.

      So, I just got my junior paper back. I did pretty well—much better then I had expected. When I stopped Mrs. Festine in the hall to hand it to me, she looked at me sternly and said, "I'll give it to you under one condition". Naturally, I anticipated the worst. Earlier today I heard about some other boys and girls who did much worse then they should have (I read their papers before they turned them in and didn't think they deserved those grades) and could see myself falling into that category too. She began to continue, "you have to..." and paused. "you have to promise me that you'll get a job writing a column for the New York Times when you grow up." I breathed a sigh of relief. Of course, the relief didn't last too long. Situations like this are already awkward. I mean, what am I supposed to say, "lol mrs festine, thats for sure, I  am  brilliant now that you mention it!!". So I just kinda nodded and had an odd smile on my face. Oh yeah that reminds me. I can't smile. I just can't. Seriously, watch me tommorow or get me to smile. Like I can't get my mouth in a ) position. I can still pretend like I'm smiling but I can't actually get the upward curving grin going. Usually when I "smile", my face forms a downward curve and I invert my lips. I guess I can do a flat inverted lip thing too but thats about as far as it goes. I wish there was a way to fix this. Surgery, perhaps. Maybe they even have something that comes in a pill. These days, who KNOWS what they might come up with. Those crazy scientists, always inventing new things like that! Like just the other day I saw a...  Uhh yeah. My paper. Once I get the time (like in the Summer), I'm thinking of making a website out of it. When I was doing my "research", I came across a buncha websites like that where kids just posted similar "scholarly" projects on the internet. Maybe once I'm working at Pop Art, I can use their expertise and resources to pursue this project. Sounds like a plan. Now I'm going to uhm, I don't know. Maybe I'll study for my AP Chem exam tommorow. Maybe not. It's hopeless at this point. I think I'd rather just play with my Rubiks cube. Yeah, I think I'll do that.  Fuck you Mr. Feebeck, fuck you. (yeah I'm baddass, cursing at the internet like that)

      I have a friend who goes to McMinville High. In McMinnville. (lol more like hickminnville) Well he's not really my friend. You see, I don't know him. Like I've never met him. But I've spoken to him on the internet. And by spoken, I mean typed. I know him from the  urlLink IGN Boards . His username there is  urlLink ewwcrabjuice . But anyway, let's call him "Glenn" (I don't know his real name). So "Glenn" wanted to do a piece for my blog. He was gonna attend a theatrical performance at his school and do a report on it. I didn't think it'd be that big a deal and from what I know of Glenn, he's a pretty funny, good writer and he'd make a fine correspondant for my blog. What he came back with was nothing short of a masterpiece. Pure brilliance. And really long.   Oh by the way, before you read, a caveat: it's supposed to be satirical. He's trying to sound faux-journalistic. And he's being more critical of the performance then he ought to be on purpose. So if you were in any way involved in the production (and I know I have a fanbase that stretches across states, nations, and uhm counties), please do not be offended. In any case, without further ado,   I prepare myself for the event. I know I will need many a piece of paper, and many a writing utensil. I bring 4 pens and pencils and 30 pieces of paper. I only used 5. 3.5 blocks and 520 steps later I reach the high school. I get three crumpled dollars out of my pocket. I do believe that should be enough for admission. Is the play even on tonight? There are 14 cars in the parking lot, and there's only 30 minutes till' the thing starts! A white car pulls in. It drops off a person I know. That person is in my third period class. I ask him if there's the any play occurring tonight. He said he believes so. He's a boy of mexican descent, and he was wearing camouflage. He's an alright kid. He leaves down the hall. He then comes back. We share quips. The box office finally opens, and he says that he's a drama student. He gets let in free. I have drama with him. I insist on paying, for some odd reason. Finally the folks at the box office coerced me into taking a free ride. I sit in the front row tonight, in the absolute middle. Right now I'm looking at the stage. There's a mock stone staircase leading to the stage, for convenience. It's grey, oh so grey. The stage itself is newly colored black. The teacher is excited, 'cuz it's like a real theatre! The castle walls stretch all the way to the cat walk up above. Of course the walls are painted grey. I almost had a latex paint to eye accident while painting those walls. The teacher wouldn't allow me to wipe my face off. Jerk. 22 people have arrived at the auditorium. I say it's about a 1:1 ratio, actor to view. 2 girls enter. They discuss their thirst. Then they leave to get the proper thirst-quenching agents. The principal, his wife, and his three daughters arrive. He has a red school jacket on, and he speaks in a whisper, as if not to disturb the littlun. The thirsty girls return, and for some reason they giggle at Lady Macbeth. Beats me. Three more enter. A tall male accompanied by two short females. The male took off his coat in a striptease fashion. Everybody has their own conversation behind me. The thirsty girls discuss last fall's production of Death of a Salesman. Luckily they loved it, because it sure beats this taco stand. The first night it opened, the actors missed alotta lines. The second night (Which I attended) featured problems in light and sound. Perhaps you heard my exploits yesterday, or rather read them. The play has yet to start. There was this super cool guy in another row that was a Vonnegut look-alike. He had the Vonnegut countenance, Vonnegut facial structure, Colonel sanders hair. Well as the bokononites (I think) say, "so it goes". More people have arrived. I'd guess about forty or so. Jesus, I could use a drink of water. Nay, I will stick to journalism! A family behind me discusses the art teacher, and how the student needs to make up an assignment. They shoulda learned in middle school. We had a much crazier art teacher than we had a shop teacher. Everybody said he was a sniper back in Vietnam. We were supposed to draw a picture of a boat, so I asked him for advice. You think a person with that supposed resume would have genius ideas? No sir. "make an ant on a leaf in a sewer", totally lame. The family seems to have gone to a whisper. You think those eavesdropping bastards read my journal? If you are reading it now, you're Bastards! The lighting dims. OH GOD, OH GOD, OH GOD, OH GOD. IT STARTS! They're fighting ruthlessly to some old piece of music. Fog is out, oh no, here come the witches! Of course they have poor posture. It seems like they are actually pronouncing words for once. King duncan arrives. It is clear that he's very stiff and uncomfortable. That dying soldier has a huge vocabulary, it seems. Nonspeaking characters like Malcolm are wobbling around with distinct boredom. Their shields are truly horrible, but they are so bad that you know they did it on purpose. You sorta like 'em after a while. Oh like a rat without a tail she will do! do! do! The witches are very similar to the ones portrayed in the film "Hocus Pocus". Macbeth is so INTENSE, it's crushing. Banque's sorta like a poet, it seems. How could one be so eloquent in front of the witches? It must be those awesome wide sleeves. He does that finger swirl thing when he talks about the crazy root. He did that yesterday. Seems awfully up to date for that time period. It's be like him yelling "MACBETH GOT OWNED!" at the end of the play, despite the fact that he doesn't even exist then. They're doing that one film technique. Macbeth walks toward us as Banque is still talking to some other guy. He then speaks to us. It might've been in the original script, but it's just so weird. Malcolm is so annoyingly portrayed, you just want to kick him in the teeth. He shouldn't be a prince. Macbeth's doing it again, gosh. The group leaves and we see Lady Macbeth reading a letter sent to her. Yet she reads it dramatically. I don't read letters to myself with pauses for emphasis. A rather dumb idea, I mean do you readers? Well do you? She's staring at the lights above. I was almost captivated, but she didn't even look at us. She's too good for us. She should've died with Macbeth, too. Creative license (cool stuff in this case). DON'T TURN TO THE AUDIENCE AND AWAY FROM YOUR LOVE IF YOU'RE SPEAKING TO HER, MACBETH! My left leg is lying on my right. The light goes out. OH WHO'S COMING NOW??!!?!?!? The stiff knight, Banque the poet, and Willy Loman-cum-Macduff.Don't forget flance, either! The lights dim, ambient music is played, and Macbeth delivers an overdramatic monologue about an assassination. He carries the knife and points it to us. He stabs it into the "STONE" staircase. He had to do that today. Yesterday he stabbed the knife into the drama teacher's beloved black floor. He musta paid hell for that. Macbeth talks to his wife some. He quickly turns to the light and sound guys, and then he looks back. You could see a certain quick reddening of himself when Lady Macbeth mentioned her nipple. Lady Macbeth is rubbing the back of the knife-wielding Macbeth as if she were the devil on his shoulder. Out comes Fleance and Banque. Fleance is carrying a mock torch, which is composed of a flashlight put in a brown cone with construction paper flames guarding the audience from seeing the flashlight. Too bad all they had to do was look up. We really didn't have to be constantly reminded that this is a high school production. But eh? Macbeth walks to us again. The closer he is to us has a direct correlation with the decibel in which he speaks. He really tries to scares us. Later Macbeth comes out with fluorescent red hands. This only means that he killed king duncan. Somehow I didn't catch that yesterday. Gee, I'm not with the program. I move my leg down. It's a shame I don't know what they're saying. It's a shame they don't know what they're saying. Out comes a folk in Pirate attire with a cane. He's trying to hard on the fake accent. He's an alright guy. Now Macduff comes out. He was Willy Loman, as previously stated. He's first class in the art of screaming. Right now that play is rather good. The lights are too bright, but that's alright. Here comes Banque. It seems like he's always baffled by something. He's carrying a knife. It doesn't seem like he'd know how to wield a blade. He's the funny, smart, annoying guy. He'd be the new cop in the buddy cop film, too wet behind the ears to know how to romance justice out of a gun (Or something similar). You know, Macbeth isn't all that great of a king. He was more convincing as a hopeful king-to-be, like simba. And wasn't TLK based off another work by such author? The circle of something or other, indeed. Two men are talking to King Macbeth. They have robes covering their eyes. This is alot better than yesterday, I'm severely disappointed : (. I am finding out more things than before. Maybe shakespeare wasn't all that bad after all. Granted he's no Cervantes, don't get me wrong! Macbeth is pulling a Macduff, it seems. Maybe it has something to do with clothes. The red coat might have something to do with it. The audience is captivated, and not saying a word. Which is neat, but now I want to talk severely. Lady Macbeth appears to be stealing the show. She kept everyone quiet for five seconds when no dialogue was occurring at all. That was neat beyond belief. Intermission starts, and I ask the original kid in the story to watch my journalism binder. He agrees. I use it to show that my seat is taken. These people are sharks, I swear. So I walk out of the auditorium and into the commons. I order a 12 OZ Diet pepsi. I ingest about 11 OZ before I start worrying about my binder. I just know that guy is reading this aloud! I will be ridiculed by everyone in the auditorium. Luckily this event never occured. I discuss about how he has to review the play for the paper. He said he has to read it prior. I comment on length, which was of course a segue for discussion related to Don Quixote. It always is. From the intercoms played "Have I told you lately that I love you?", cueing the end to intermission. IS BANQUE DEAD? Yes, a ghost?!?!?!? Macbeth is talking to me. I'm in front of him. But he refuses to look into my eyes. Neither would queen Macbeth for that matter. I am chronicling their movements, and looking at them as I write. Two folks start talking to the witches. The lighting messes us. It's a shame that the witches still are corny. Why did "Liver of blaspheming jew" pop up? It just stuck out when the witches said it. Two of the witches hair are messy and appropriate, while one is totally normal. Strange. Now the lighting crew messes up again. Out comes the headless kings, I believe. The dead Banque is just so much cooler than the live Banque. Macbeth is off to kill Macduff. chatter chatter chatter Macduff's wife and child are brutally murdered chatter chatter chatter. I was thinking that I was being far too harsh on this. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy it immensely. Nevertheless, you think Macduff would be a tad suspicious when a guy was hesitant to answer about the status of his wife and children. And our Macduff fell to his knees the exact second that it was revealed. A tad early, it seems. What progresses are intense little hide and go seek games until BANG! The big fight. They duke it out pretty well, but the deed was finished backstage. Rather lame. And as Malcolm and his gang enters the scene, Macduff rushes in with the head of Macbeth and we as an audience exclaim   "THE KING OF SCOTLAND!"   Well nobody in the audience did, but if they did, it sure woulda been nice. I then discussed Netherlands from the disarmament committee with a soldier.     Yeah, that's it. Wow, huh? Oh and by the way, Netherlands from the disarmament committee is me (thats who I was at MUN). The soldier is Andrew O'Sullivan. Those of you who attended the MUN confrence might know him as one of the MUN undersecretariats. He goes to McMinnville High too.

      As you can see, stuff looks different—I've put in a new spiffier-looking layout. And a new blurb up top. I've lost some customization but yeah, it happens. What do you think of it? Does it look better? Oh and guess what. You can also leave comments now. I might take that away if people start abusing it (like I abuse other people's ones). So leave a comment with the answers to those questions. Or just make up names and post ridiculous comments. That's what I'd do if I were you.   Oh yeah and as you can also see, I'm at a complete lack of ideas for titles. If you can come up with something good and I'll use it.   UPDATE: Hmm, I can't seem to get comments to work so I took it away. Nevermind that.

      I've got a shitload of work to do right now and little time to do it so naturally, I figured it would be a great time to write a blog entry. I've pretty much given up on stuff. The outline has been on and off. About a dozen times through it, I just decided to fuck it and started playing with my Rubiks cube.  I mean, not playing, PRACTICING. Because its for work. Not leisure. You see, I hafta get one complete layer done in under a minute for tommorow. As of right now, I can do it in about a minute and a half. So I've gotta a lotta work to do. And that means alotta practice. So that's how I can justify it. Well that's how I had justified it. I'm beyond that now though. Now, if I reach a roadblock in my outline (authentic Mike Simons terminology there), I just give up. But yeah, enough bitching about that, I'm done. She's about five pages long—beastly by any standards— and I'm proud of her. Now I've shifted my concern to the AP Chemistry exam on Monday. I was supposed to read all of Huck Finn this weekend (thanks Gus) but I uhh have yet to begin and I don't see it happening anytime too soon. My Christian Service paper is also due Friday but that probably won't begin until Thursday night. Oh but wait. Thursday night is Bob Edwards night! Bob is coming to town for a lecture and I'm going. And so is Brian. Oh and the night before that is some college visit question and answer thing I have to go to. And the day before that is the AP chem exam. And the day before that is tommorow. And the day before that is today.   But wait. Let me rewind. Err, fast forward. The chem exam. It's been quite a dilemma. You see, I already payed $80 for it and really didn't think I was prepared. But I figured, meh, might as well take it, it can't hurt right? Wrong. If I do poorly and want the score removed from my score report, I need to pay the College Board $5 per score report. Assuming I apply to say 10 colleges, that means I need to pay 'em $50. So basically this means that if I take it and do poorly I pay $130 for absolutely nothing. But if I don't take it, I pay $80 for even more nothing. But if I take the test and do well (which is highly unlikely), it's $80 well spent. Oh and if I do poorly, I'll probably wind up taking the SAT II Chem in October which means I need to buy a book, pay for that test, study during the summer, and take it then. Which is more hassle. So its quite the dilemma. And who should I blame for this? Myself for not studying and making the wrong decision? Nah, why would I do that? First I blame Darrell for not teaching us what he was supposed to teach us. And for continuing to teach us what he's not supposed to teach us. And for teaching us poorly whatever he did teach us. And I'll also blame all the sophomores in the class. Way to motivate me to push myself and take the test when I knew I couldn't. Maybe if all of you were a little dumber (well I know Rohit is...which is another thing that pushed me to take it...if a dumbass like him can take it, why can't I?), I wouldn't be in this situation right now.   But I should stop complaining. Its not that bad. I'll probably end up taking it. You only have to get like a third of the questions right to get a 3 which I'd be more than happy with. The multiple choice isn't that bad anyway, all I'm really worried about is the free response but I may be able to BS my way through that. At least 1/3 of my way through that that is. Anyway I should probably be studying huh? Nah. It's hopeless at this point. Maybe I'll do some free response practice tests and try to get the other boys (and maybe Darrell!) to meet at Starbucks or a library tommoorw. Or wait, maybe we should just go over to Darrell's house. But yeah, another advantage to taking the test is that I miss Monday. Which means I really don't need to have Huck Finn done. And I also don't have to do anything for the model Congress thing  in Peace and Justice (so no dressing up on Tuesday). Or wake up early for the NHS group interview for officers (oh yeah damn I totally forgot about that). Or finish 2/3 of The Autobiography of Malcolm X (I've got about 1/6 done so far). It'll probably accumulate afterwards though. But who cares, after this week, I'm done with school. The Decemberists are coming to town the week after and I might go that concert. That'll be coo'. But other then that, yeah, it'll be easy. I might have finals in my senior classes but those won't be too bad.   And then its a few weeks of nothing and then summer! And whats Summer? Summer is doing an 8 hour a day apprenticeship at a little company called  urlLink Pop Art . (I just got the letter, it sounds pretty exciting.) I might take some classes at PSU too, if theres anything interesting. Maybe a nice class on some authors or literary movements I enjoy. Or maybe I'll volunteer with the Kerry campaign. Or sit at home and ja- wait no, this isn't Rohit's blog. But yeah, Summer also means... urlLink NAPOLEAN DYNAMITE !!! Make sure to watch that trailer. It's gonna be the best movie ever. I can guarantee it. It will blow everything else away. Another movie I'm looking forward to:  urlLink Garden State . It's just a really good trailer. Thasall. Oh and one more thing. I think I've started to get into old school rap. I pretty much hate all other sorts of rap/hiphop but I downloaded some Beastie Boys and I must say, it was rather phat. Rather phat indeed. Then I downloaded some Run DMC. Similar levels of phatness. Then I asked some rap fans what else I should download and they made their recommendations. The phatness stopped there. Everything they recomended was the rap that over the years, I'd come to know and hate. So I guess the rap I like is the rap that rap fans hate. So if there any rap haters out there reading this, I'd appreciate if you made some rap recommenations for me. Thanks.  Yeah, that about raps it up. Oh but wait. Enough self-indulgence, I think I should post something thats not about me. I mean, it's good to see that I've still got the touch and I still can write (well not really, just compared to my previous shit, this is seems ok....hmm, that gives me an idea!), but all I just wrote about was stupid stuff about me that no one cares about. Okay so yeah, I was reading the news and noticed that Col. Gaddafi of Libya was visiting the EU for peace talks or something. But yeah, I mean, I know the guy's an evil dictator and everything, but jeez, he sure has taste. You see, wherever he goes, he's accompanied by a troupe of all female bodyguards. That's class. I mean, if I was an evil dictator, I know thats what  I'd  do. See:     Hmm okay, that was lame. I'll stop now. This is long enough. I think its time for me to return to work. Which is a four letter word. Hah hah hah. Get it? No?  urlLink You suck.

      They name elements after famous scientists. If I get an element named after me I'll make a tshirt that says something like "111 shakeerenium" on it. Then I can go around engaging in all sorts of tomfoolery and when people are like "whoa shakeer what are you doing you're crazy and out of your element!", I'll be like "nope, I'm very much in my element thank you very much". That'll show em!

      I've reached blogging menoapuse. I've lost the touch. I'm getting too old for this shit. I can't keep up anymore. So I've resorted to begging others for content. Gus chimed in with this little freestyle rap:   Yo, I'm thinking up a master plan, so it don't matter if I get a ghetto tan, you people think you know how to rap, but I started this shit so you better go take a nap, up in my grill where I will dish out nothing but nill to those two faced, blue laced, whole tub o tooth paste frauds who stole my entire show, but everyone knows I rose from the low not to write prose so fuck y'all I won't take a fall! Payce!  He admits its not amazing but hey, I'm desperate.

      I have a friend called Brock who lives in New Jersey and he read my blog and was like coo so he was like hey i'm good at writing pathetic stories about how pathetic I am too and I was like coo and so I was like hey how would you like to write some stuff for my blog and he was like uhh i dunno i was like c'mon first one's free so he was like mmkay and he wrote this story:  on friday that girl i was talking about was handing in something during history class and friend sitting next to me said it looked like she got her pants out of the garbage because you know how sometimes people buy pants purposely ripped up because it is the style abd so i told her in math class that he said it and i was like aw yeah i stood up for you and said that they were very nice pants and that he should STFU and she was like thank you (jokingly of course) and she said she was going to repremand him and so today during gym class she's like "hey friend i heard what you said about my pants" and friend is like hey well HE LIKES YOU and i'm like no so then everyone in the gym class is like nanny nany poo poo etc and i'm like no way guys stop it and this one mean kid was saying to her like "you want to lick his body" and she was like shut up mean kid and then she was awkward the rest of the day and in math class she asked the person in front of her for a piece of paper and not me like she normally does  Funny thing is it's not a story—he actually does suck that much. What a loser huh. C'mon everyone, tease him. "na nee na nee poo poo brock and that girl sitting in a tree k i s s i n g".

      It seems to be the latest trend in the ever-trendy world of highschool blogging: telling gimmicky and silly self-indulgent stories that end awkwardly and few care about. Well because I'm Shakeer and I like to keep it real, I'm gonna mix it up a little. Here goes nothing. Get ready for it. It's the Shakeer narrative style. Here I go.  ok so i know this one girl who has a dog named jack her name is danielle the name makes for some pretty comical situations (the dog's name that is)  like take the other day  now give it back!  lol  but yeah so apparantly she was walking her dog one day in some sort of place where are dogs are walked and these was this guy a hot guy apparantly she wouldn't disclose how hot he was i asked though just you know, for the story's sake but yeah so jack ran up to the guy and was jumping on him dannielle was like "jack, off! jack, OFF!" get it? yeah it was pretty funny i guess you had to be there i wasnt there but if i was it probably woulda been funny oh and the other day on the internet i was talking to her about how she mised an entire day of school to work on some project and so i asked her how much of the project she had managed to complete and she was like "i'm so worried, all day i did jack"  a sly comment followed  sly indeed i'll leave it up to you to figure out what it was oh yeah another story i have this great story about this clever prank that went horribly wrong it woulda been awesome cept it went wrong horribly wrong you see: me and some pals were thinking of pranking this one guy the guy was driving his car and we were gonna like scare him but we scared the wrong person !!! the prank was the scaring it went horribly wrong see?  we scared the wrong person thats wrong hmm k lets see what else i've got from my exciting life on the edge so the other day i was at starbucks and some stuff happened like someone took someone else's drink and stuff and then we jewed starbucks out of another drink cool huh ok so i only said that so i could use the word jew in that context lol ok i got another one the other day in religious class mr daley decided to go around the room and ask what each person was stressed out by at the moment he's nice like that you see so yeah most people were saying stuff like summer jobs, prom, AP exams, SATs, college, the junior paper, senior projects, blahblah so then we came to zach tarver zach's stresses were somewhat different "uhh, I'm kinda worried cuz I might not graduate." "im kinda failing math and well if i dont pass i dunno whats gonna happen" "man, I've really gotta work hard to bring my grade up to a D these few weeks..."  mr daley proceeded to zing him with "way to shoot for the stars Zach"  everyone loled hmm yeah guess ya kinda had to be there anyway so one more thing some guy at school a few days ago "who do you think is the hottest girl in the junior class, if you know what I mean"  I was like WTF of course I know what you mean its kinda self-explannatory you d-bag.  (the d stood for douche)  the kid btw was this guy called rohit you can read his "livejournal" here beware: its quite possibly the lamest and sickest thing on the internet well not the lamest that'd have to be brian seo's blog ^^zing and not the sickest either that would have to be http://www.goats- uhm nevermind ok thats about it for now i cant think of anythign else ok bye i'll be here all week make sure to tip the waitress and try the hot wings they're fantastic   Hmm, that sucked. Well what else should I write about? Well everyone else is writing about getting rejected from MYAB or ASE or whatever else they're getting rejected from. I'd love to write about that too but well, guess what suckers: I got accepted by both. Anyway, yeah, I think I've reached my peak as a blogger. I think its for me to pass the torch onto the younger generation. I might do a farewell tour but after that I may have to retire. I know this might come as a devastating shock to some of you (oh who am I kidding, to  all  of you) but I'm sorry thats just the way, well thats just the way cookie crumbles huh?

       urlLink Here's the slideshow . Make sure to read the witty captions. They're witty. Real witty. But don't take my word for it. Read 'em youself!   And also check out these videos:  urlLink A rufio  (notice how Brian is completely out of sync).  urlLink Another rufio . Jack  urlLink breakdancing .  urlLink Gus and Jack karaoke-ing  (It's only the end bit, the rest was like 30mb. You can order it by special request. Just send me a blank disc and $5 for handling fees and I'll ship you a copy. I've also got the Michael and Avital tape but that'll cost ya extra). Oh and finally, well,  urlLink just watch it. .  The videos kinda ruin it though in my opinion. The conference was a pretty neat time but these video's don't capture the fun we had. Whatever, you've all been bothering me to put em up so enjoy. (That took entirely too long to do.)

      Whoa! Gus updated! Maybe I ought to get off my ass and update too. Anyway, yeah, I've been pretty busy as of late with my this internship I'm doing. In case you don't know, its the ASE thing and I'm doing it at a local webdesign firm called  urlLink PopArt . Among other things, I aid in the design and production of webcontent. Fun stuff. Whatever, its keeping me busy and I'm earning the respectable salary of approximately HALF OF MINIMUM WAGE. I'd go on about it but yeah, no one cares.  So, Napoleon Dynamite. Boy have I been pumped about it lately. And boy have I been in for sore dissapointment. Last week, I went to a preview screening over at Pioneer Square and yep, you guessed it: didn't get in. I RSVPed for tickets and everything. I remember I saw a kid there that I knew and was like all "hey I'm watching napoleon dynamite. oh, you wanna see it? yeah, sorry, you can't. yep, I got mad hook ups. you see, you gotta RSVP at the website. yessirree." Little did I know that I was in for quite the egg on my face in a few minutes. And then I went again yesterday. The first time we were about five minutes late so I guess it makes sense that we didn't get seats. It was, after all, a highly anticipated preview screening. This time though, we were two hours early. And yep, once again, didn't get in. This time we were like 4 people away from the cutoff point in line. Oh man, it was painful. Anyway, I'm gonna try again this coming Tuesday and although I can't get out of work to make it there more then an hour or two early, hopefully I can get someone else to go early and stand in line. If all else fails, I'm hiring a hobo.  So yeah, Gus, if you're reading this, that means no tshirts.   And if you're reading this, good work kid. Keep it up.  Oh and the foreigner night tomfoolery update and pictures will be up soon. If you're someone who knows what that means, then yeah, you know what it means. If you don't, haha sucks to be you.   And also my iPod finally ran out of space so I've begun the tragic process of deleting music. Oh and I also just reformatted my computer so I had to look through old files and choose what to delete and what to keep. Once again, how depressing.   Speaking of thinking that stuff is depressing, I've started reading Catcher in the Rye again. This is my 2nd time. I think I'm gonna make this a "read it every summer" sort of thing. I'm really liking it the second time around. In fact, I don't remember it being this good the first time. I hope I'm not turning into one of those pretentious depressed reclusive CITR fans though. Well maybe I do. Just a little though.

      Shakeer and all blog readers, I just want to give you all a big WHAT UP from Greece.  As I write this entry, I am sitting in an internet cafe on the island of Mykonos.  Its off the heezie, the sun's up, the beer is cold, and the ladies are hot.  Haha, well sort of.  I have yet to hook up with a girl, but we're leaving for Africa tomorrow so the chances are looking better.  The word on the street is the African chicks are HOT!  Shakeer how was Napoleon Dynamite?  Or has it come out yet?  I'm expecting a blog entry and I want my shirt.  Didn't we bet or something for it?  Anyway, I'll try to update when we're in Africa with some pics.  This is Gus Jewell for Shakeers blog, out.

      (Click the link above.)  Its so stupid it isn't funny. Well maybe a little. Alright, its hilarious. He's such a douchebag. Here are some particularly golden quotes:  "in the grand scheme of things a typical human life is like a blink of an eye. the days that seem like an eternity become so insignificant when looking at the big picture, but what is the big picture anyway? each person's picture is the size they feel it to be."  "certain musical notes in specific variations of sequences are a foundation for universal communication. instinct. an understanding beyond our mind's ability to formulate."  "i love the country. i love north carolina. i am going to move there. get some land and have a damn ranch with a skatepark, studio, four wheelers, baseball diamond, horses, and a small house. just get loose and be creative on my own time. it sounds so right. i'm gonna do it. see ya!!"  "i also love skateboarding and the culture of the skateboarder's whole existance."  "as soon as we hit the stage we decided to play by "our" rules, which is "no" rules, and let it come out. we played Faith and our new single Almost Over. i'm curious to see how they edit it. TV shows are so fucking phony sometimes. fake applause between commercials, people taking take after take to make it believable, etc. it's amazing how long i believed in what the television was providing me as an adolescence. now that i have been on the other side of the curtain i just can't believe what we're led to believe sometimes. oh well, fuck it. we rocked our songs once and bailed. it ended up being kind of tight."  "i am an american alien living in an ever so changing place within my mind. i see too much with my eyes and i feel too much with my soul."  I just wanna throw a brick at him. I almost feel sorry for how retarded he is. Almost.   This part pisses me off the most:      Ugh. That just isn't right.

      WHAT A TERRIBLE MOVIE. It sucked. So fucking unrealistic! I mean c'mon! People can NOT fly no matter how you try to justify it. Oh and "hypogriffs" WTF? JK Rowling musta been smoking some crazy pot when she wrote that part because I don't know about you but I have never ever seen a "hypogriff" in my life. I wouldn't be surprised if she just made it up. Also, why would you take a train to school? I know they're in Britain and probably wouldn't wanna be caught dead in one of those tiny little shitty cars but c'mon, there HAVE to be other ways of getting to school. Why not just take a bus? Who drives the train? Are they part of a union and are fairly compensated for their work? None of this was very fleshed out or explained. Talk about a lack of details. Its like the directors just made stuff up and didn't explain it. Oh and TIME TRAVEL? Give me a break. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS TIME TRAVEL. Well, at least not without a whole lot of antigravity and wormholes and I don't know about you but I saw neither in the movie.   Overall, a terrible waste of money. Go see something worthwhile and scientifically accurate like The Day After Tommorow.

      Ameteur night is coming up down at the one bar on 15th and Glisan so I've decided to write up a routine to show off my humor. Here's one of my first bits, the computer dorks amongst you'll love this one!:   So what exactly is it about spyware? There's a spy on my computer? Where!? This must be why, everyday I log on to my computer I get all these blinking buttons and advertisements for porn. Hahaha. Porn is what all men love. Ask a man what he loves, he'll probably list in this order: porn, my wife, cardboard cutouts of famous people. At least that's my list. I used to have the ****iest job ever. I actually worked for McDonalds. When people would give their orders, I'd actually say... would you like fries with that *whispering under my breath* ...bitch? It was awesome until one day my boss (a female) took an order from me! Let's just say, the bitch came down! Wank you very much, you've been a great audience!  Pretty funny huh? You like how I transitioned from the spyware stuff to the thing about what men love. It was pretty tough to do (it's probably one of the many challenges, and for me, struggles, of writing quality comedy). And what did you think about the "wank you" at the end...nice touch, huh?   Alright, I've got more! Here's one about airports, this is usually material that never gets old!    So what is it with the airports and the so called "airport" security? Yeah, check my shoes for bombs, bitch. Who stores bombs in their shoes? Who actually thinks, hey, got my socks... got my bombs... I'm ready to go! What if they stub there toe, does the whole shoe go up in smoke? (quite literally, I may add!). Hahaha, why do they hire dumb people to protect these planes. Why don't they hire smart people? Wouldn't that be a better idea? Hahaha.   Thanks, you've all been wonderful.  Good stuff huh? Trust me, there's more where THAT came from! Here's another one. It might be sort of controversial but it's usually seen as one my more sophisticated and witty pieces. It usually gets quite a few laughs with my test audiences (but then again, what DOESN'T mom find funny?):   If God is soo real, why do hot dogs come in packages of 6 while buns in packages of 8? And if God has a penis, is it big enough so that he can fuck himself. The fact of the matter is, that when we die, that's it, there's no afterlife. Anyone that tells you otherwise is a dumb bible thumper, hahahah! If god were one of us, he'd ride the special bus and smoke canibus! Isn't that a funny mental picture, a retarded, marijuana smoking god. He'd be really dumb, as dumb as those that believe in him, hahaha!  Anyway, thats all for now, I've got alotta prepping to do!

      First of all: dude, Sonic Youth is coming to Portland. If there's one concert I'm gonna go to this summer, it has to be this one. (Well if I beg and pester mom and pop enough, I may be able to see the Pixies in Bend in September, but thats not summer.) I know I say this for all the concerts I've talked about on the blog (yup, all TWO of them) but this seriously will be amazing. Sonic Youth is one of the greatest bands of all time and they seem like they'll be fucking terrific live. Just listening to their music makes you wish you could hear them live. When you hear Kim Gordon wailing her characteristic wails, you can almost imagine how she'd look like performing it. It just sounds so great and I can imagine the ambiance will be significantly cooler live. Okay damn, I suck at talking about music. I wish I could describe this better. Then again, as Elvis Costello once said, and I paraphrase, "writing about music is like dancing about architecture".   But yeah, I can ancitipate absolutely nothing wrong with the concert. It's at the Crystal Ballroom (never been there, but have heard lotsa good) on the 15th of July. I'll probably need to get tickets early, seeing as how its Sonic fucking Youth (sorry, I'm just really excited). They had a new CD come out last week and although I didn't think it to be that great early on, after a few spins, I'm seriously growing rather attached to it. Its great. If you like them, take the advice of this high school senior (yeah senior) blogger from Portland, and give it a go. It's worth it and I have a feeling it'll sound even cooler live. Same goes with their old stuff. I bet it'll be awesome live. UGH I JUST CAN'T WAIT. Man oh man is this gonna be awesome. Okay, I'll stop now. I'm obviously too into their music right now to deliver the fair and balanced reporting you expect from shakeer's blog. In any case, yeah, I'm excited and I can't wait. Same goes for Pixies though, but thats much later. Man, I'd kill to see the Pixies. And their opening act is gonna be Death Cab for Cutie who are okay as well. But yeah. God damn. Sonic Youth and the Pixies.  Anyway, make sure to read this week's  urlLink Onion . It's a great issue.   And also, the first Napolean Dynamite free preview screening is THIS Thursday. Boy, am I pumped. If you're interested (or let me rephrase that: if you're hardcore enough), RSVP yourself some seats  urlLink here . If you go, you can get yourself a suh-WEET tshirt. (The movie doesn't come out 'til the beginning of July at Fox Tower so unless you're lame or safariing in Africa, you should watch the preview screening.)  One more thing: some of you might remember the link I had on the side for Shehab Ahmed's blog. Well, Shehab's blog has come to an unfortunate end. It was great while it lasted and all of us in the local blogging community are sad to see him go. He had some really funny stuff on it. oh, how the mighty have fallen!  Shehab's Blog - Never Forget April 2004 - June 2004 RIP.  Alright, thats enough for now.   Wait. One more thing. After hours (no, days) of tireless and mindnumbing toil, I've finally made another one of  urlLink these . This last one looks pretty damn spiffy if I may say so myself. All those hours of cataloguing and organizing (and not to mention, listmaking) just serves as further proof that I'm slowly becoming this guy:     Nothing wrong with that though. Right?

      Say you walk into a room, and you are carrying only one medicated adhesive strip (or bandage, if you will). Two fine gentlemen walk up to you and you have a feeling that each have a story to tell. You turn to the first and he begins explaining that he's a manager of advertising for a major shoe company. Apparently he started off young in the field of entrepeneury with an old-fashioned Lemonade stand at the age of 8. Upon reaching the legal age to work, he jumped right into a position at a department store. He was assistant to the manager of the electronics department. Fine worker. Dedicated, hardworking, and friendly. Employee of the month, very first month in. A dry period of about 4 months hit, but then 5 consecutive employee of the month awards were bestowed upon him. He had the nickname "the janitor", because boy, did clean up those awards or what. (He also reluctantly hinted at the possibility that the nickname may have been due to his insistence that the sales counter always be spotless.) When asked to move up the proverbial ladder, he declined. After all, collegiate studies were his top priority. He wanted to out live the legacy of his old man, a very successful archeologist that hit it big with his series of groundbreaking (literally hah!) volumes noting the correlation between life in it's purest form and an East Ethiopian dinosaur bone excavation. He, a down-to-earth man himself, realized that these ideas may be too niche to generate any true public interest and thus he made a lite version. He called it "A Groundbreaking (Literally, Hah!) Volume Detailing the Correlation Between Life in It's Purest Forms and an East Ethipian Dinosaur Bone Excavation: Lite". It had pleasant sensory details and was a hit in the beauty salons. It just had that universal appeal. Moving on, he decided to focus his talents in acting. He was very rusty but for reasons unknown, his instructor developed quite a fondness for him. Sure, some of the more apt students mocked his new and somewhat unorthodox methods, but by god if he didn't light up the stage. He was the only reason for the University of Illinois's drama department existence. He was quite the inspiration. Why, after his unforgettable portrayal of Banquo, a brand new hall was dedicated to him. When a then-fledgling department of a large multinational shoe company wanted to endorse him for their new line of acting shoes, he accepted. After 6 glorious years at that college, he moved east, to Asia. He was enthralled by their innovativity, and wanted to be part of it. Of course, he was enduring the difficulties of living abroad in a hostile and unfamiliar territory as a labour of love, since he was getting paid enough from the sponsorhip for a few more years. After the first three films he starred in, he became an internationally-known acting sensation. Noting the potential of losing him to the world of cinema, the shoe company offered him a manager of advertising position. He accepted, not expecting the massive pressure his position entailed. Oh! The charts he saw! The numbers he crunched, the migraines he recieved! You're probably thinking, sure but the acting world was probably fraught with its own share of chills and spills, so this guy ought to be ready for anything. Well, that's hardly the case, all you'd have to do is walk one mile in this guy's acting shoes shoes in order to understand what he was going through. Still, he was a steadfast and committed worker and soon put his own reservations and problems aside in favor of company interests. He continued to try new things and utilized a number of clever advertising methods. Unfortunately, this was far too inefficient for a man of his ambition. Memories of the lemonade stand came back, and he remembered the integral selling point: price. The prices were slashed and sales went through the roof. Audiences who never were able to afford such spiffy shoes bought them and became addicted. His rise to number one was undeniable and he was soon featured on the cover of all manner of magazines including Time (man of the year, in fact), Fortune, and some lesser known industry quarterlies. He even appeared on the Late Show with Jay Leno and lit up the crowd with his fiery story of his rise to fame and success (he was after all, quite the stage performer). Five months after his television spot, he released a book comparing the complexities of running a shoe company to those of a Lemonade stand. It bombed. Terribly. His success remained, but so did the feeling of failure. This probably was why he seemed so down.    Moving on,  you glance at your watch and ask the other person for his story. He had severe vision problems and was rather old. Apparently he hosted a Canadian morning talkshow, like Today, or Good Morning America (except Canadian). He was teamed up with a 20 year veteran, who on camera was rather cheery, but off camera was quite vicious. One of the producers referred to her as a "bitch" and as the man revealed this particular detail, he leaned in and lowered his voice, as if not wanting to utter that word publically. Of course, there's no one in the room but you and these two men, so such an endeavour seems trivial. In any case, he continues and explains that the coworker didn't trust him because, at that time, he was a greenhorn. He had no credentials or prior experience, yet the audience loved his zany zingers and how he hosted the Cooking Tip of the Day like a real professional. She noted regretfully that she was the last of a dying breed. Only her and the camera man had been on the show since its founding, some 20 years ago. Thus, after much contemplation and consulation, she left the show with a bang, right in the middle of a broadcast. Right in the middle of a sentence, she barged off without a word. Not even a word of explanation. She bumped onto a coffee table on her way out, thus producing the bang. There afterwards, the camera panned to the greenhorn's puzzled face for about 5 awkward seconds until the producers scrambled to cut to a commercial. For the rest of the show's career, that point was known as its lowest, but also its most memorable. In any case, the man continued to host the show and took it in new directions and areas, including many in which it previously had not dared to venture. Like Northern Yukon (broadcasting fees and expenses were pretty steep there). Unfortunately, after 30 more years of having that ridiculously bright brightlight blared into his face, he began to notice slight vision problems and eventually had to quit. This was a difficult decision because a large nationwide 24-hour news network was looking to hire him but of course, vision always came first in his mind. With this, the man concludes his story, and as you and the first man both bow your heads in contemplation, he asks you, "Do you think they should make unfunded federal mandates unconstitutional?" Then the other man,  looking up, continues with, "If so, is the problem the result of the fact that they're unfunded or that they're federally mandated? Or perhaps, some sort of outlandish mixture of the two?"   And that,  my faithful blogreaders, is the question now in front of you.

      They were in town for the Rose Festival and initially I was pretty undecided about whether or not to go. After all, the band hasn't really produced any solid music in like 20 years (or at least the only music I knew of was produced that long ago) and sounded like typical washed-up local city festival fare. Still, the three or four songs that I'd heard of them I loved and I'd only heard good things about their live shows so I decided to go. The concert started off pretty lame and I wasn't really feelin it, if you know what I mean. They played Blister in the Sun pretty early on (just as I got there in fact) and I was like meh, they shoulda saved it for later when the vibe was better. Eventually though, it started to pick up. I've been to rock concerts before but this was the first true ROCK concert, complete with huge amounts of secondhand smoke, flickering Zippo lighters, earth-shattering bass, mean-looking security guards, visibly entoxicated musicians (between songs, the lead singer would complain of how loud everyone was clapping and all the bright lights in front of him), rowdy fans, and plenty of crowdsurfing and shoulder-hoisting. All of that was cool. The music started getting better too, and up close, the band sounded really good. They were all really talented and entertaining and as they carried on, the did some numbers I recognized and could sing along to (like Add it Up and Kiss Off). In fact, when both of those songs came on, the crowd went wild. They also did some songs that I otherwise probably wouldn't have liked (they sounded awfully country-ish at times) but were enjoyable live. Oh and then it started raining like mad (this is after all Portland) but they made the best of it and sang some song about rain, I forgot what it was. Anyway, yeah, I thought they'd be lame since they were like balding and washed-out but they still had it. Then again, everyone's getting old now. Even the Beastie Boys. One of them has gray hair now. I guess it'd be depressing if I had listened to them as a child and all but yeah, I didn't. I noticed alot of people in the crowd who looked like they obviously had grown up listening to these guys. In the end though, the whole being old thing only made it funnier when they were singing about sneaking out the window and begging daddy to lend them the car. By the end, I was thoroughly entertained. They were really good and I'm glad I went. A great live band.   Here are some pictures so you can see how old and stuff they are. (I had to go through alot of trouble to get them, one of the security guards was like "NO CAMERAS ALLOWED, THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING" but I'm badass so I just weaved my way into the middle of the crowd and continued taking pictures.)

      My name is Gus.  I have been invited to join the esteemed writing team of Shakeer's blog.  You may have read some of my work concerning the Junior Paper.  Mark this day my friends because today is an important day for Shakeer's blog.  No longer will this blog remain flacid, idle, and unused, a lot like Rohit's... well....  Anyway, I am calling upon the blog to produce beaucoup amounts of material from commentaries to reviews.  We'll have rants, raves, cartoons, movies, pictures and all sorts of awesome shit!  So from today on Shakeer and I will both update the blog everyday.  No matter how trivial the entry we will still update.  The blog will never go a day without being updated that is our oath, our promise, our only reason for living.  To spice up the blog, Shakeer has sent me on location to Tanzania, Africa for a safari.  I will be updating along the way with pictures and great stories.  So get ready for the new and improved Blog.

       urlLink George W. Bush, Meet the Press, February 13, 2004:  Tim Russert: If the Iraqis choose, however, an Islamic extremist regime, would you accept that, and would that be better for the United States than Saddam Hussein? President Bush: They're not going to develop that. And the reason I can say that is because I'm very aware of this basic law they're writing. They're not going to develop that because  right here in the Oval Office I sat down with Mr. Pachachi and Chalabi and al-Hakim, people from different parts of the country that have made the firm commitment, that they want a constitution eventually written that recognizes minority rights and freedom of religion.    urlLink George W. Bush, Rose Garden press conference, June 1, 2004:  Question from reporter: Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Chalabi is an Iraqi leader that's fallen out of favor within your administration. I'm wondering if you feel that he provided any false information, or are you particularly -- THE PRESIDENT: Chalabi? Q: Yes, with Chalabi. THE PRESIDENT: My meetings with him were very brief. I mean, I think I met with him at the State of the Union and just kind of working through the rope line, and he might have come with a group of leaders.  But I haven't had any extensive conversations with him.  Q I guess I'm asking, do you feel like he misled your administration, in terms of what the expectations were going to be going into Iraq? THE PRESIDENT: I don't remember anybody walking into my office saying, Chalabi says this is the way it's going to be in Iraq.   urlLink Source.

      Today's song of the day is  urlLink Such Great Heights  (4.7mb) by The Postal Service. Its that indie pop stuff I was blabbering about recently. Its good stuff. Sorta sappy but still good. The rest of the CD ( Give Up ) is great too. I've got the rest in case you want it. Here are the lyrics, read 'em along or something I guess. They're pretty clear, but I thought the songwriting was worth a share.     I  am thinking it's a sign that the freckles in our eyes are mirror images and when we kiss, they're perfectly aligned.  And I have to speculate that God himself did make us into corresponding shapes like puzzle pieces from the clay.    And true,  it may seem like a stretch,  but it's thoughts like this that catch my troubled head when you're away when I am missing you to death.   When you are out there on the road for several weeks of shows  and when you scan the radio I hope this song will guide you home.   They will see us waving from such great heights,  "come down now," they'll say but everything looks perfect from far away, "come down now," but we'll stay...  I tried my best to leave this all on your machine but the persistent beat it sounded thin upon listening that frankly will not fly. you will hear the shrillest highs and lowest lows with the windows down when this is guiding you home   Yeah. Listen.

      Yeah, thats right. Remember when Times New Roman used to be old and clunky? Remember back when every kid on the block was sporting some avant garde classy font like Verdana or Trebuchet? Well guess what. Those days are over. None of that shit anymore. Times New Roman is making a comeback. Times New Roman is now what Times New Roman wasn't: hip. Its the ghetto fab revolution. Retro, bitches. Fuck that New Age Avantgarde shit, its all about getting down and dirty. Times New Roman is a classic that should never have been abandoned. Its rough. Its tough. Its simple. But not Express/J-Crew simple. Oh, no. This is Kmart/TJ Maxx simple. So connect with your roots. Bring back Times New Roman.   But wait. I don't think the formal world of papers and shit is ready for this kind of revolutionary behavior. Times New Roman needs to work its way up the chatroom and instant messanger charts before it can make its hit in the assignment/written work market. This is the people's revolution. We're gonna hit em hard from underneath. The underground is where Times New Roman will fester. So you heard me. Use it in your profiles. Use it in your emails. Use it in your IMs. And get rid of that Verdana garbage. Shed the highlights. Drop the colors. Fuck all that bourgeois shit. Its time for the proleteriat to take control again. Its all about simple pure black Times New Roman now. Feel free to change the size though. Thats pretty ghetto fab, in my book.   Oh and remember: you heard it here first. As the instant messanger aesthetic capital of the internet, my profile is gonna be leading the Times New Roman revolution. Get your piece of the proverbial pie while you still can.

      Hi, I'm bbs. Astounding introduction, wouldn't you say? Somewhat deceptive though. My name's not really bbs. That would be silly. I mean, it reads good, but would you really want to call someone that to their face? Awkward, if you ask me. So yeah, my name's not really bbs, but if you want to call me that, go right ahead. I'm not going to tell you what to do. As far as I know, this blog promotes free speech. Not just in free speech zones, either! That would be mediocre. And apparently, we're against mediocrity.  I'm not going to lie to you and say I'm a very interesting person. I'm not. As previously stated, saying I was interesting would be an outright lie. In fact, I'm not sure why shakeer would want someone as stale and flat out boring as I writing for his blog. I can't write about the cool things I've done and the adventures I've been on, because I haven't been on any. Take today, for example. Today I woke up (that was a given). Anyway today I woke up and read a book. Not very exciting, I think you'd agree with that. So after I read a book I watched some television. Watching television is definitely not exciting, unless it was the Daily Show or something like that, and it wasn't, it was the news. So I read a book and watched the news. After that I had a sandwhich, which I guess some people would like to hear about, considering the sandwhich industry is really thriving right now from what I understand. The sandwhich was turkey and ham. If you're interested in further details, feel free to email me. So after the sandwhich, I basically just looked at the wall for awhile. Then I watched Hellboy on DVD. If I was a movie critic, I could elaborate, but I'm not. That's the problem with me. I'm very critical but you'd never know it. So I watched Hellboy, and here I am.   Wait! I almost forgot! My dog had diarrhea today. I guess I could describe it a bit (the whole ordeal spans several hours and 5 rolls of paper towels), but dog diarrhea isn't interesting, it's just gross!  So, taking all these factors into account, it looks like shakeer made a big mistake. I have absolutely nothing to write about!

      ...just seeing if it works. shakeers gonna kill me for wasting this space so i better say something.  This space is normally reserved for semi-interesting happenings of the day in which shakeer encounters strange young men downtown and gives them presents such as the very shirt off his back.&nbsp; Just dont give him your pants,&nbsp;I dont care how hot it is outside, or how sweet the pants are. Moving on.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to use my first blog post to introduce to the world a new expression.&nbsp; My brother and I have used it for years but i think the world may be ready for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;When something is cool you say&nbsp;"that is NARWHALE".&nbsp;This expression finds its origins in the classic word "gnarly" and is also closely related to the&nbsp;"narwhal"&nbsp;&nbsp;(Monodon monoceros), a rare white whale found in the Artic Sea that wields a distinguishing long spear-like tooth.&nbsp;  This first entry was flippin narwhale.

      you're working on some stuff for a build for a huge client and you create&nbsp;a local project and do a get-latest-version&nbsp;from Visual Source Safe on you localhost and make all your edits and then use the robocopy script to deploy everything to the staging server but robocopy deploys the wrong files and overwrites everything on the staging server with all these old files and totally ruins the staging site and the person who worked on the usercontrol commands and business logic before you didn't back up his files in VSS so they're all gone and you think you're a goner because the guy didn't have anything saved in his localhost but then suddenly you find out that some changes can be recovered from the previous evening's magnetic tape backups over at easy street hosting but that means you need to drive all the way over to easy street on beaverton hillsdale highway and that'll cost several billable hours and cut into profitability and delay the product launch a few days and you get blamed for it all even though it isn't your fucking fault that the other guy forgot to check his goddamn files into Visual Source Safe?!?!?  I know I do.

      Yesterday, I saw Barack Obama deliver the keynote speech at the DNC (I've had C-Span on in the next room as background noise for the past few evenings) and wow, it was amazing. He's one of the best speakers I've seen in a while. His demeanor was composed and charismatic, his arguments intelligent and reasonable. I was really impressed.&nbsp;Barring some major political scandal or something, I suspect he'll have a soaring career over the next couple of years. I mean, barring some sort of major scandal or something, in ten or twenty years, this guy may very well become the first serious&nbsp;African American presedential&nbsp;candidate. I haven't been this excited by a politician since...since well, Bill Clinton's speech the day before. Just kidding, yeah, this guy is definately going to be one of the Democratic Party's most promising stars in the future.   Barack Obama for President in 2024!   Hah, yeah, as I was saying, Clinton's speech was really powerful too. I just saw Edwards earlier today...he was alright. Definately not as good as these other two guys. I don't see what all the fuss is about his charisma. Well, maybe when you put him next to Kerry, that element shines through more visibly...yeah, I'm starting to sound like some lame armchair political candidate.   Speaking of which, today I was party to a particularly ridiculous incident of stupid political punditry at the watercooler at work (okay, we can't afford&nbsp;a watercooler, we have a fridge with magnets on it). It's been embellished and exagerrated for this comic adaptation, scanned straight from my brand new Moleskine:      ( urlLink CLICK HERE TO MAKE THE ABOVE PICTURE BIG AND READABLE )

      As you've probably noticed, I've changed the layout of the blog. It looks somewhat spiffier.  More notably though, I've cut down on the total number of posts displayed on the main page. That should make the page quicker/easier to load.   Oh and, I've also figured out how to make the Comments thing work! As well as Archives! So now you can view all my old posts! And you can post comments! Please do, as my self esteem feeds directly off the comments you leave. Without your comments, I am nothing.&nbsp;

      It's awesome. Hopefully this will usher in a prosperous era of plentiful blog posts and creativity. You see, I always come up with cool stuff to post about or whatever but then by the time I get home and tucked away at the keyboard, I forget it. This also happens alot when I'm laying in bed, right about to fall asleep. I always tell myself I'll remember but uhm, I don't. This should put a swift end to that.  Yeah, am I loser or what? But hey, at least I'm a loser with a cause. Hey, thats a good idea for a blog title! I think I'll use it. Don't worry, I'll probably get sick of it in a week and take it off by then.

      Today I was walking around downtown during my lunchbreak looking to purchase things I didn't need with money I didn't have and was actually sort of lost. I was consulting this walking map I had, trying to find the street where I could get a bus back to work when this kid about my age zipped by on his bicycle. I looked up and for some reason he was staring at me. He was pretty shifty looking. I stared back and he turned around. I returned to consulting my map, brushing the experience aside. Then I looked back up and so did he, but then he looked away again. This time, I got a good look at his bicycle. It was a pretty nice bicycle, I must say. Anyway, once I figured out where I needed to be, I started walking up to the place where the bus would come. I stood there, waiting for a bus and noticed the kid was waiting too. Naturally curious about this mysterious person who kept looking at me,&nbsp; I looked at him. This time, we both decided to put this awkward exchange to an end and he shuffled over to where I was standing and was like "you looked lost". He gestured at my map. I explained I was&nbsp;simply searching for the appropiate bus stop.&nbsp;"You from around here?" he asked. I can see why'd he ask that. I always look pretty goofy with my map and backpack. I explained how I worked in the area and stuff. He was like "you work here? how old are you?" I explained my age and the nature of my job and told him he had a nice bicycle. Then he got to the point. "That's an awesome shirt," he said, gesturing at the homemade Fugazi shirt I was wearing. Fugazi is like an alternative/punk band from the late 80s and they never trademarked their name so no real Fugazi merchandise exists. Thus, I took the initiative and made my own shirt. "Yeah, I made it myself...you can get iron-ons online," I replied. I stumbled at the three "on"s (irON ONs ONline) in a row and chuckled. I do that alot, chuckling at stupid stuff I say.&nbsp;He didn't seem to notice.&nbsp;"Yeah, Fugazi owns!" he said. "Actually man, no one owns Fugazi!" I retorded.&nbsp;He laughed. I was of course referencing the fact that no one owns the Fugazi trademark. And then, I dunno why, but I felt generous, so I was like, "So uhm, do you want this shirt?" He was like "whoa, are you sure?" I explained that it was no problem since I could just make another one. I took it off and handed it to him. He was really appreciate and made extensive note of his gratitude.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I noticed my bus pulling up and lamentfully realized that it was time for our paths to branch away.&nbsp;Sealing the bonds of our deep friendship, we made our farewells and parted off onto our own ways.   Now I have to wear this damn sweatshirt in this sweltering heat all day long but I think I'll be okay.

      If Ralph Nader singlehandedly captured Osama Bin Laden like a few weeks before the election. Now, I'm no fan of Ralph himself but I have to admit, this would be like&nbsp;so awesome&nbsp;since every politician in the country would immediately be pissed off at him. Not to mention all the bad guys and stuff.

      Today I was at Starbucks and I was sitting at this lame table that was filthy and wobbly. Then suddenly I saw this guy across the room get up from his clean and sturdy so I totally pounced on it. He thought he was getting away all sneakily but with me around, he most definately wasn't.

      Like how you'll be driving along the interstate and listening to Wilco and then suddenly you'll see one of those signs informing you of the gas stations that exist at the next exit and on it, it says Wilco, on account of the fact that Wilco is also the name of a gas station and that gas station chain happens to have an outlet at that next exit from the interstate. You'll see it and be pretty excited and because the music is so good and the coincedence so spectacular, it'll almost feel serendipitous but you'll realize that no one will ever know about what just happened and that that moment will forever be lost and that even if you tell them, they really will not care.  Then again, why should they?  &nbsp;  PS. Thanks for the post and stuff, Gus. I figured my use of expletives would accurately convey my frustration. Come to think of it though, it's pretty lame. Like you know, lame as in "omg my mom told me to pick up my clothes but i was like fuck off mom i dun wanna and she was like go up to your room young man and i just went up and listened to my punk rawk 4eva, down with&nbsp;rules and stuff yo!!!"

      Was it just me? or were many loyal blog readers shocked to see Shakeer's latest and may I add outdated update titled "I'm a fucking idiot"  I've known Shakeer for many moons and I have never heard him say "doggy poop" let alone the forbidden word that I will not mention here.  Shakeer you have let down me, your fans, and most of all the blogging community.  So Shakeer, cut the fucking, dog kissing, boner biting, ass whiping, shit shoveling language.

        You know the Sonic Youth concert I've been preaching about nonstop for the past few weeks? Yeah. It's today. And yeah. It's fucking sold out. And yeah. I didn't buy tickets in advance. I'm such an idiot. I figured I'd be able to get them this week. So I went on Monday but the box office was closed. So I figured I'd get them today. The day of the concert. HUGE MISTAKE. So then I went on eBay and found a total gem—a charity auction for a 2 person general admission ticket PLUS VIP pass (so meeting the band after the show). I was excited beyond words. I quickly put up a $25 bid (I was the first and only bid with the auction ending in a half hour). And yep, you guessed it, I got outbid. Some fuckers came out of nowhere at the last minute and outbid me. I got served. Thoroughly and wholly. On the way back home, I stopped at Crystal Ballroom and I saw this hugeass tourbus. Upon closer inspection, I noticed Thurston Moore chillin beside it, pulling stuff out of the trunk! Some kids were heckling him for autographs. They had like bags full of shit for him to sign. I didn't have anything but I was just like "whoa Thurston Moore!" He just chuckled and he was signing stuff. I tried talking to him and he was pretty polite but unresponsive. Probably really stoned. I explained how I couldn't get into the show because it was sold out. I was like "dude I can't believe you guys sold out so fast!". He responded with "fuck you, asshole". I was like "no dude, I mean the concert!" We then shared a chuckle and he was like "hey I like you kid. how would you like some free backstage passes and tickets?" I was like sweet thanks and then I saw the concert and it was amazing.     &nbsp;  Okay, the conversation ended after I explained my situation and he was like "man thats too bad...sometimes we tell the venues to reserve a few tickets for right before the show...I guess we didn't do that here".

      I have to keep writing so I'll post this useless psot. Today at work I didn't do much. In fact, I don't think I did anything. I had one meeting but thats it. It was the first day where I spent the entire day just doing nothing. And then I came home, really tired for some reason. Probably beacuse of the goddamn heat. So I took a nap. It was an okay nap. Three and a half stars. Then I watched Mystic River with my mom. Four and a half stars. No but really. It was good. The ending at least. Thursday I'm going to see the Sonic Youth show. I'm trying to beg people to come. So if you're reading this and I haven't begged you and you're up for a great rock concert, talk to me. It'll be good.

      Well hello there blog. It's been a while—over two weeks...and my last entry was crap anyway. I suppose the reason I haven't been writing for a while is that once you stop, its hard to pick it back up and "report" whats been going on in my life all of a sudden and as time passes, more reportable material snowballs, thus hindering my will to post even further. Now I know what you're thinking. "lol yea rite shakeer u dont have nething in ur life to report lol". Yeah, I guess. But I still didn't feel like writing in the past two weeks (then again, two weeks isn't really that much time). In any case, here I am, beginning again. Because this is my first entry in a while, it should be pretty thorough. I've gotta lot to catch up on. Then again, the longer it is, the less likely people are to read it. We'll see though.  Anyway, the reason I suddenly decided to start writing again is I'm reading Jack Kerouac's On The Road (loyal shakeer's blog readers will be thinking "whoa shakeer, I thought you read that like last year, whats goin on man?!" Well loyal shakeer's blog reader, cool it. I started reading it earlier this year (and read about one half) but never got a chance to finish on account of all that school reading we get assigned. Geez. Cut me some slack, man. And its not like I can't read books more than once! I just finished reading Catcher in the Rye for the second time and it was just as enjoyable (maybe even more) this time around. I think I may turn that book into an annual tradition. Wow, I'm such a dork. But anyway, I'm reading On the Road for the Jesuit summer reading thing. So I have a reason. Other then the fact that book is amazing. Whatever, I've started reading it and I guess I've become inspired to write all over again.   So I'm at work now, wasting my time writing this. I don't think I've done an entry on work yet so hey, I think I'll do that. I've probably already mentioned that I'm doing an internship at a webdesign firm in downtown. It's called PopArt. They basically are contracted out to make websites for various companies and organisations. It's a pretty small company (less than 20 employees) but some of their clients are somewhat high profile. My internship is in the programming / software engineering department and I mostly just do bitch programming work...the tedious easy work that none of the real programmers do. Also I get payed diddly squat. If you calculate my hourly wage, its something like $4. But I guess people don't do ASE for the money. Well obviously they don't. And I'm making it sound much worse than it is. It's been a pretty interesting experience. The whole corporate environment thing is interesting, to say the least. It's almost like a new culture. And the actual web development work, well I'm learning as I go and it's a pretty rewarding experience—seeing the end product of my toil. One thing that sucks is the temperature. The PopArt office complex is divided into two wings...the nicely decorated and furnished main wing and the production wing. The latter is quiet and boring. And because the roof has no insulation and we're on the top floor, the heat just bleeds straight through the tar and bakes us. The fact that our air conditioning is a piece of shit certainly doesn't help either. So its like about 95 degrees in here right now. Probably more. I'm not very good at estimating these things but pulling numbers out of the air like that gives you an air of legitimacy and wisdom. As does saying things like "broadway and glisan"...or "the corner of 3rd and stark" ...or "across the street from the koreon grocer oN upper burnside"...it just makes me sound so...so cosmopolitan! Yeah.  Yeah, I'm such a dork. Anyway, today is my birthday. I'm 17. No more trying to be badass and sneaking into R movies. Now I can brandish my ID with pride when I get carded at the movie theater (something that I prophesize will continue to happen for the next decade or so, judging by my growth rates).  Maybe thats one reason I'm writing this. Kurt Vonnegut wrote Breakfast of Champions as a 50th birthday present for himself. This blog entry will be a 17th birthday present for me.   Anyway, what else do I have to say? Last weekend I went to Seattle. In Seattle they have that Experience Music Project. That place is amazing. It's probably like the single awesomest place on earth. They had like drums and guitars and stuff that you could play and I like learned it all and stuff, it was fun. If you're in Seattle, check it out.   Yesterday I saw the movie Ghost World. Great movie. Well maybe not awesome, but definately really good. I liked it. Nothing spectacular (I guess I was expecting a little too much of it) but I liked it alot nonetheless. Maybe one reason I didn't really get into it way too much was that I had this fuckin headache when I watched it. Caffeine withdrawl, I suspect. Thats what mom says. She won't let me take any headache medicine. Gotta build up a resistance for this sorta thing. Can't become immune to tylenol at such a young age. It's only a lousy headache. nuh uh mom it really hurts! but yeah. I'll make sure to watch it again. It was good.  Also I went to Powells many a time in the past few weeks. Thats always cool. Its near where I work.   Oh and I got my AP scores. A 5 on Calc and 2 on Chemistry. Just what I suspected. Blegh.  Yeah, I can't think of anything else to say.

      today these random group of young men were talking about spiders and there was this random hot girl sitting near them and the girl sort of joined in on the discussion and one guy was describing this spider of particularly unbelievable size so the girl was wincing in fear and plugging her ears, jokingly of course, so the guy was like "awww!" and then he totally just gave her this big hug and squeezed her  i was like wow what a sleazy bastard you don't even know her  i had an immediate dislike for the group of guys. they all seemed like assholes. assholes who wore matching flip flops and cutoff tees (or tank top, whatever they're called) and applied inordinate amounts of jell to their hair to preserve the neatly manufactured disorder they had spent who knows how many minutes that morning crafting. assholes bursting with opinions, opinions on everything. assholes willing to say anything and do anything just because they were insulated by their asshole group of friends.   oh man, i certainly hope i never become that sort of person  but yeah, sorry to digress, i actually wrote an entire essay on my ordeals on the max today in my head and transcribed bits of it in my moleskine  but then i realized that it wasn't something that could effectively be put into words  then i decided i needed to record it on tape beacuse alot of it would sound interesting  but then i realized that if i recorded it, it wouldn't be as cool because without explanations, no one would recognize the signifance of whatever it was that i was recording. so then i deemed commentary neccesary, like a "what i'm thinking in my head" thing  but that doesn't really work with audio recordings so i decided decided that videos would be better since i could show everything in raw form  but yeah, i always pick up very interestings bits of dialogue that i really wish i could somehow record  like this woman who was walking around reading out loud an advertisement for a hotel or lodge of some sort from her head in the middle of the sidewalk to no one in particular  later she went on and declared that she wasn't crazy and that everyone could think that she was but that she'd never sink down to their level and judge others like that and that perhaps by being crazy she was living up to everyone's expectations  that killed me  some smartass from behind me (i didn't catch sight of him) then decided to exclaim "it's a free country!" but the woman continued on with her speech, walking back and forth on the MAX platform, oblivious to the stares and commentary  this was truly a sight to see   but back to the hot girl in the max. i wrote up a whole story in my head about how she was this slutty rich pampered girl who was riding the max for some reason today and how she got her kicks by finding and fucking random men that she met on the subway and how scattered and fragmented and unfulfilling her life was and how she lacked a conscience  much of this i gathered from her conversations with these new "friends" of her and others were from plain old stereotyping    at one point the guys around her (there were like 5) began poking her like one would poke and tickle a child and quickly turn away so as to not let him/her know who the mysterious tickler was  she seemed to enjoy the experience   then at a later point the 5 guys pointed at this disheveled scruffy african american man a few seats back and made fun of him for his looks and demeanor. one said "haha that one crazy nigger" or something in a fake imitative voice of some sort that i don't care to identify.  i inadvertendly shot a glance back to identify the subject of their amusement and they caught me in the act  addressing me, one of the more arrogant ones in the bunch asked if i agreed with their suppostions, "hahaha this guy knows what we're talkin about, ain't that right?"  i had no choice but to agree  i felt sick

          Well, not the "new" Elliot Smith album; rather, it's the future Elliott Smith album. You see, it isn't out yet. But I downloaded it last night from indietorrents.com (it was sweet, took like 2 minutes to download the entire thing) and I'm really loving it. I've only given it like 2 spins but so far I like it better than all his other albums.  Anyway, I can't wait for it to actually come out. I'll probably purchase it, if only because I'm a tool. Allow me to explain. Elliott Smith died last year. He committed suicide. Well actually, I don't think his suicide was confirmed, there was some conflicting evidence or something that left unanswered questions. I'm not sure if that's been settled. But that's another story. For another time.   So you see, before he died, he was working on this record "From a Basement on the Hill" but sadly, he never completed it. Sadly, indeed. Anyway, the album was essentially all recorded but wasn't mixed and mastered and all that other business. Since his death though, some fine mixers and masterers have taken care of that and his family has okayed the release. It comes out it in October. Somehow though, versions of the album were leaked and as a consequence, his die-hard (no pun intended) fans began severely criticizing the pirates and filetraders who began downloading the album, accusing them of being graverobbers who were desecrating his name and disrespecting his legacy and the wishes of his family. Quite the bum rap.   I don't really agree with what they're saying but I'm feeling pretty guilty nonetheless so I think I'll buy the album for good measure when it's released anyway. That's all I have to say.

      Yesterday I was on my way home from work in the pouring rain without my trusty Seattle Times (I have no idea where we got it, my family has never lived in Seattle) umbrella and I was strolling down the street where the Max blue line runs westward (the north side of pioneer place)), the name escapes me. This is next to the Courthouse, the portion of our humble town where that disproportionate number of jewel-studded punks hang out near that perpetually-overflowing fountain with the brass beaver in it or something, and I'm always a tad bit frightened when I pass here since the punks have a tendency to yell crude insults at the people walking by (I think I've been subject to a racist remark once and earlier this week, I heard one of them yell up "fat goth bitch!" at this young woman walking in front of me. I know fat people and I can tell you that the target in question was hardly fat.). I don't know why this particular area fills me with fright because I'm always walking around alone in the Pearl or in Chinatown without the slightest smidgen of concern but this area I usually try to get through as fast as I can.   In any case, none of the punks were in sight yesterday, probably on account of the inclement weather. As I was rushing towards pioneer square to find some shelter while I awaited the Max, I saw this particularly hip-looking couple right ahead of me. The male half of the party had the cookie-cutter scenester pastel retro shirt and tight neatly-pressed jeans, topped off with thick glasses and overgrown hair. The female half had fashionably short hair with a wide nonelastic Audrey Hepburn-style print headband, an unseasonable old-school ski vest, and a knee-length skirt of a modern cut. Both were sporting the sort of hipster attire fairly common in our nothing-short-of-hip town these days. They looked like any other high school couple, out for a splendid afternoon on the town. I didn't pay too much interest.  Later though, as we were all huddling under the banister adjacent to Starbucks to escape the rain, I got a better look at the couple. Turns out, they weren't a couple at all. The girl wasn't a girl at all. She was like a woman in her mid 60s. The guy was still like 15. So it wasn't a hip couple, it was a kid, escorting his grandmother around the town. Thing is, even upon closer inspection, it became apparant that she she was indeed dressed like your typical record store clerk or fine arts major.   My point? This, my fashion-forward highschool friends, is the danger that you must be ever vigilant against, particularly as it relates to "retro" fashion. Bear in mind that when you decide to revive a fashion trend, particularly in an ironic manner, there will still be people who wear that fashion, unironically, as though it had never ceased to be current. The mullet is a particularly most salient case in point here. You see, when you decide to grow an ironic mullet, you run the risk of either offending, or even more dangerous, impressing, people with straight-faced mullets.   This is why I personally have elected to revive the monocle. That was pretty much the purpose of me telling this entire pointless story. You see, there aren't a lot of people alive anymore who had them, and the ones who did probably have interesting stories. Now I just need to find one.   Any suggestions?

      Okay, I lied. I didn't go to the mountains. I didn't even go on vacation! I'm such a bad liar. Come to think of it though, I did sort of go to some mountains today. Sort of. You see, I went to a store that has mountains as its logo. Patagonia. It was cool. I picked up some fancy literature and a bumper sticker. The clothes themselves were much too expensive (but cool nonetheless) so I just picked up their schwag. It's stuff about voting. Or something. I didn't read it, I just picked it up.  Yeah, I was at the Ecotrust building in the Pearl. I had some pizza. And breadsticks. Very good pizza. Even better breadsticks. I also picked up a brochure for the Time Based Art festival that PICA is putting it on. PopArt gets free tickets because we're a sponsor and I was pretty interested until I found out that unlike what I expected, it wasn't an art show featuring interesting time-based art. Instead, it's some stupid fancypants festival thing with like music and drama and shit in the streets. Pretty lame, huh? Yeah. So I'm definately not going to that.

      Hello friends, just when you thought I had once again left you in the dark about upcoming concerts in the greater metropolitan Portland area, I'm here to bring you another one, fresh off the presses!   Death Cab for Cutie ,  They Might be Giants , and  Pedro the Lion   will be playing at the waterfront this coming Friday. It kind of sucks because that's also the day Kerry may be visiting Portland for some unannounced public rally. And Bush too, possibly. Crazy, huh! It's also my last day at work. But yeah, Death Cab for Cutie is awesome. Probably one of the coolest bands out there right now. They'll be worth the ticket alone. Pedro the Lion is pretty cool too, I wanted to see them like a month or two ago but it was at a bar or something so I couldn't attend. They Might be Giants, yeah, they're alright, I dunno, they'll probably be cool. And stuff. There are some other bands performing before them but they're mostly just local contest-winners and I probably won't be able to make it anyway. But yeah, 3 great bands over the span of 5 hours for five bucks. "FIVE BUCKS?!" Yep, five bucks. You have no reason not to go. I mean Death Cab for Cutie for five bucks! They're also going to be touring with Pearl Jam and R.E.M. and stuff for the Vote for Change tour that goes to a bunch of battleground states to get people to vote or something. That isn't coming here. Bastards. But yeah, I was gonna see them with the Pixies in September but that's like labor day weekend and it's in Bend so it might get complicated. I also want to go to Bumbershoot in Seattle (like a gajillion bands ranging from shit like Nickelback to well, the Pixies themselves and also other cool stuff like Harvey Pekar, of American Splendor fame) that weekend but ehh, we'll see.  Anyway, yeah, that's Bite of Oregon.  Pink Martini  will perform the next day at the Bite of Oregon. That might be cool. It probably will be. They were at the Crystal Ballroom last month for a Kerry benefit concert.   The Friday after that is Mr.  David Byrne , formerly of the Talking Heads! Now the Talking Heads is like one of the coolest band of the 80s (Life During Wartime was my favorite song of all time for all of this week) and David Byrne, although old and stuff, will probably still be amazing. I hope he plays SOME Talking Heads though, not just his solo stuff although I probably shouldn't judge any of his solo stuff on account of the fact that I haven't heard it. But it probably ain't as good as the Talking Heads. Anyway, it should be good. It's at the Zoo. That'll be interesting.  Also: that night  Mogwai ,  Rapture , and  Cursive  are performing at the Roseland but I mean fuck that, David Byrne is where it's at. Oh and if you didn't catch Mr.  Art Alexakis  at prom (like me!) this year or at the last John Kerry rally butchering "Brown Eyed Girl" (yeah, I dunno wtf he was doing there) or Flugtag (ok, he's a loser who needs to find better things to do), you can catch him at Dante's that Saturday (8/21). Oh but wait. You're under 21 and can't get into Dante's. Sucker! So unless you've got a fake ID, you'll have to settle for the  urlLink Antique Roadshow Tour  at the Convention Center. ok, I admit, my fascination with that show may drive me to actually go there.  Anyway, then the next big night is the Friday of Labor Day Weekend. That night, Portland is treated to  The Unicorns  and  Ben Kweller  at the Roseland. The Unicorns are awesome. Jawsome, one might even say. Well their first album was last year (or was it the year before?) but their new EP is kinda lame. Really lame in fact. But their first album was liek woah. So that should be awesome. And it'll top off the first week of school, so that's cool. And stuff. Oh and Ben Kweller is cool too. He was featured in the Jesuit paper (yep, people actually read that, and not just if they quickly scanned it and found their own or their friends' names in it) so read that I suppose.   Anyway, that Saturday is  THE PIXIES ! In Bend. I'd love to go but it's like in Bend. After that,  My Chemical Romance  is coming to the Roseland on Sunday. Go if you're into that sort of thing. I certainly am not.  The next week you have  Hilary Duff  at the Rose Garden on Wednesday the 8th. 'nuff said.   But screw that. You might want to go (if you're Gus) but save your money for that coming weekend. It's  urlLink  MUSICFEST NW  ! Lots of venues. Lots of bands. Shuttle buses. Festival prices. Bands stuck out (for me at least):  Built to Spill  (they're a great band, I'm not a HUGE FAN but I like them nonetheless),  The Decemberists  (cool band, AMAZING live), and  Xiu Xiu  (haven't heard too much of them but have liked what I've heard). But there's more, from all sorts of backgrounds and styles. Check out that site. It's not just rock, it's all kinds of music. Thus the name.  And then, to top off a great month for music here in Portland,  FRANZ FERDINAND  is stopping by at the Roseland! I shit you not, Franz FUCKING Ferdinand themselves! Yep. It will be awesome. And it will sell out faster than, well faster than something that would ordinarily sell out slower than Franz Ferdinand will. Which is pretty fast, if I may say so myself. So make sure you get tickets early!   That wraps up September. That's all for now folks!

      There is a travelling dodgeball tournament coming to Portland on August 21st!  And yes, I am playing.  I'm putting together a team, so if you want in, give me a holler.  Right now we've got Me, Sean, Charlie, Pat Schneider, and Danielle Towne (If we play in the co-ed league, haha sorry danielle).  It should be amazing!  We have to practice though, because we're going to kick ass!

      It's the book I have to read for the schoolwide summer reading thing. I've only read like a third of it and already I have to say: it's well set to claim the coveted title of "shakeer's favorite book ever". But don't take my word for it, read the book! Or if you haven't the time to do that, read the following excerpts. And if you haven't the time to do  that , MAKE the time.   My favorite passages yet far:  Then he told me how Dean had met Camille. Roy Johnson, the poolhall boy, had found her in a bar and took her to a hotel; pride taking over his sense, he invited the whole gang to come up and see her. Everybody sat around talking with Camille. Dean did nothing but look out the window. Then when everybody left, Dean merely looked at Camille, pointed at his wrist, made the sign "four" (meaning he'd be-back at four), and went out. At three the door was locked to-Roy Johnson. At four it was opened to Dean.   ****  Dean and I are embarked on a tremendous season together. We're trying to communicate with absolute honesty and absolute completeness everything on our minds. We've had to take benzedrine. We sit on the bed, crosslegged, facing each other. I have finally taught Dean that he can do anything he wants, become mayor of Denver, marry a millionairess, or become the greatest poet since Rimbaud. But he keeps rushing out to see the midget auto races. I go with him. He jumps and yells, excited. You know, Sal, Dean is really hung-up on things like that.   ****  My moments in Denver were coming to an end, I could feel it when I walked her home, on the way back I stretched out on the grass of an old church with a bunch of hobos, and their talk made me want to get back on that road. Every now and then one would get up and hit a passer-by for a dime. They talked of harvests moving north. It was warm and soft. I wanted to go and get Rita again and tell her a lot more things, and really make love to her this time, and calm her fears about men. Boys and girls in America have such a sad time together; sophistication demands that they submit to sex immediately without proper preliminary talk. Not courting talk-real straight talk about souls, for life is holy and every moment is precious. I heard the Denver and Rio Grande locomotive howling off to the mountains. I wanted to pursue my star further.   ****  "What's your road, man? -holyboy road, madman road, rainbow road, guppy road, any road. It's an anywhere road for anybody anyhow."   ****  We each had a bedroom, and there was a kitchenette with food in the icebox, and a huge living room where Major sat in his silk dressing gown composing his latest Hemingwayan short story-a choleric, red-faced, pudgy hater of everything, who could turn on the warmest and most charming smile in the world when real life confronted him sweetly in the night. He sat like that at his desk, and I jumped around over the thick soft rug, wearing only my chino pants. He'd just written a story about a guy who comes to Denver for the first time. His name is Phil. His traveling companion is a mysterious and quiet fellow called Sam. Phil goes out to dig Denver and gets hung-up with arty types. He comes back to the hotel room. Lugubriously he says, "Sam, they're here too." And Sam is just looking out the window sadly. "Yes," says Sam, "I know." And the point was that Sam didn't have to go and look to know this. The arty types were all over America, sucking up its blood. Major and I were great pals; he thought I was the farthest thing from an arty type. Major liked good wines, just like Hemingway. He reminisced about his recent trip to France. "Ah, Sal, if you could sit with me high in the Basque country with a cool bottle of Poignon Dix-neuf, then you'd know there are other things besides boxcars."      "I know that. It's just that I love boxcars and I love to read the names on them like Missouri Pacific, Great Northern, Rock Island Line. By Gad, Major, if I could tell you everything that happened to me hitching here."   Okay, enough self-indulgence. I just had to share.

      This was submited by a rising star in the blogging community, Danielle Towne.  Observe the genius that flows from her words.  If viewers enjoy her entry she may become the newest addition to The Knights of Portlandalot!  I was strolling down the aisles of Target today when all of a sudden the craziest thing happened.  I saw this poor little girl with this giant grin on her face tugging a giant blue beanie chair down each and every aisle.  She scooted along with tremendous authority.  And her nametag gleamed with a golden touch flashing Kat-tay (her parents were German monks and thus added a dash in the center of her name).  I found the feathers on my back fluster as my lips curled together.  This girl was headed for the children's underwear section which contained my famed "My Little Pony" underwear- And I say my because yes- it is my underwear.  Although I found myself intimidated and at a slight sweat I marched down the aisle, following the damn blue beanie.  I tediously spat in that poor little girls face and dashed in an Eastward direction as I grabbed the last pair of "My Little Pony" underwear flashing my knife.  You could say I was on Napolean's victory march but no- I was too late, my plan was thwarted when a man dressed in a giant Osama costume (im afraid of those muslims) stepped outward and planted his fist between my pair of squinting brown eyes (I didn't have my contacts in) and I was thrown backward with a tumultuous thud as I landed in the Malibu Barbie meets GI Joe section.  You can imagine the pain I felt at that moment.- that's when the Target police came dressed in white with a splattered red target on the front and I felt the handcuffs go on.  Lets just say my actions hadn't been on "target" that day.    P.S.  Don't be offended by the Muslim comment- if you agree its offensive then agree to disagree.

Space exploration is really Narwhale but its not like the probe is gonna pull a Columbus and accidentally find something on the way to one of the least interesting planets in the solar system.                   .....or will it?    How sweet would it be to find some aliens?  Really nice aliens that are stupid and can be easily enslaved.

      We are becoming more and more dependent on foreign oil, a slave to foreign oil some say. We'll always need to import some, but we can do so much better than we are now. Our economy doesn't have to be their bitch, and its not just a matter of our economy. This dependence has caused just about every brouhaha over there in the Middle East. There are alternatives in our own backyard, but don't tell that to Cheney the Oil Pimp, he needs to stack his cheese.

        I created what i believe to be the single most offensive image ever. All the major religions are covered here. If you feel left out because you dont see your religion included in this amazing work of art, have no fear. You were offended just as much as the others by not even being considered, so dont be jealous. If this makes you mad then please leave a comment! Who knew MS Paint could be so controversial?       P.S.  - to clear up some confusion, the penis is not Osama Bin Laden, it is the Prophet Muhammad,  shiza.

      As you can see, the blog title has been changed to celebrate this great kingdom which we live in and will someday rule.  While we know much about our own kingdom of Portlandalot i dont think were up to snuff when it comes to understanding the Nether-regions of our flat, 300 mile wide rectangle of the known world. Who would have known the world animal is the Beaver? Its true these fanged beasts roam the netherswamps but rarely enter our kingdom. Our world fish is the Chinook Salmon and the world shell is the Oregon hairy triton, certainly a shell worthy of Poseidon himself. It makes me wonder however, what is the shell of other far off landlocked worlds such as Wyoming? The peanut shell perhaps. Our world mushroom is the Pacific golden chanterelle, a favorite of the local wizardry community. Our world drink is of course Milk, the sweet bovine nectar of life. Yes this world is certainly full of mystery and ours for the taking once we crush the surrounding barbarian tribes of Hillsboria, Gresham upon Avon, and the southern rival forces of Kulongoski the Terrible.

      Today I went to a garage sale and purchased me five records: two Eagles albums, Simon and Garfunkel's  Bridge Over Troubled Water , this album called The Super Smash Songs of the Sixties which is actually just 10 assorted Beatles tracks, and a Chicago album (yeah, I dunno). It all cost 50 cents. Thing is, I don't really have a record player to listen to these records with. All I can do is take them out of their sleeves and inspect them for imperfections. Granted, I don't know what I'm looking for but it's still pretty cool. They're all dusty and musty. I can also read the covers. It's fun but the amusement only goes so far. So if you've got an old record player that you don't care for anymore, I'll be willing to relieve you of it. I did some searching at local thriftshops for one but found nothing that suited my taste (basically, one that works). So please contact me if you have a record player that you're willing to sell.   Anyway, most of this has just been a setup to say what I really wanted to say: I just listened to the Simon and Garunkel song  The Sound of Silence  like 20 times in a row. The only other track that's ever reached that high for consecutive spins is Neil Young's  My My Hey Hey (Out of the Blue).  That had like 30-40 over the course of like two days. Crazy, yeah I know. But now you know too.   Nothing else of note happened today. Well wait. Today I was sitting at the kitchen table inspecting the Sunday Oregonian and fiddling with a can of Diet Coke in my right hand when suddenly the can burst. I think I was shaking it then I squeezed it because it suddenly had a gaping hole in its side and the contents were rushing out of it like, like, well like something that would ordinarily have its contents rushing out of it in a more spectacular fashion then you'd normally expect for the contents of a Diet Coke can to be rushing out in. It took me like a half hour to clean it all up.   Oh and Mr. David Byrne of the Talking Heads will be performing at the Zoo on the 20th. I expect to go but I'm not going to make any definite declarations until I have the tickets in my hand. Also: Franz Ferinand is coming to Portland in late September.  urlLink Read all about it here .   Anyway, I hope Franz Ferdinand doesn't sell out too quickly but I have a feeling they may. It's too bad.  (I'm talking about the concert lol)

      A few days ago though, I made a prediction. Anticipating a horrible dissapointment on the scale of "omg the aliens invading this planet thats comprised of 60% water actually fuck'n disentegrate in water!!", I made a predication about how lame this ending would be. Completely in jest, I guessed that in the end, we'd discover that the "monsters" terrorizing the village weren't monsters at all. They were modern day people and this village was some crazy blast-from-the-past village stuck in the middle of modern society.  Well. It turns out, that's pretty much what happens. Yep. Now don't get angry at me for spoiling the movie because I assure you, I'm doing you a favor. I haven't seen the movie yet myself, I just got a plot summary from a someone who knows someone who did. The former was Brian Seo, so please make sure to thank him for making this public service announcement possible. The latter, well I don't know who he is, but let's just say he wasn't as lucky as the rest of us. Fortunately, we can honor his sacrifice by all not watching this movie.   So yeah, as I said, I was right. Almost dead-on. And I was totally joking when I made my prediction. Apparantly, what happens is there's these rich people who are fed up with soceity because they've all had violent unjustified deaths in their families. So what do they decide to do? They decide to spent their money in constructing a village. In the middle of the forest. Also, for some reason, they decide to have this village set in the 1890s. Slowly the village grows and they have kids and stuff. To ensure that the kids don't leave the village, they dress up in monster suits and circulate stories and lore about what lies beyond the forest. They even bribe air traffic controllers to insure that airplanes won't fly over the village because that might cause the kids to inquire about what these peculiar flying contraptions are (since these kids born in a village thats apparantly set in the 1890s would somehow be able to figure out that airplanes don't belong in the time period that's being recreated here). They also carry around these secret black boxes that contain mysterious contents. In the end, we learn that they contain cell phones that are hooked up to the village's secret PA system.   Anyway, the movie is about this villager getting stabbed. They need to send someone out to retrieve medicine and dressings from the outside world (apparantly the billionaires didn't think of keeping some neccesary medical supplies when they decided to transport themselves a century backwards for no reason) so what do they do? They send a blind girl. The blind girl ventures out into the real world, meets M. Night Shymalan and comes back with the medicine. She never figures out whats going on. No one does.   Yeah, ****ed up, huh? I'm not joking. That's actually what happens. I hope you don't watch it now. But man, it sucks, we brown people finally had a shot at credibility in Hollywood and suddenly this guy blows it. Now all our hope is riding on the shoulders of one stoner from New Jersey.  Kal Penn, DO NOT LET US DOWN!

      They are an extremely rare occurrence, but FATTY attacks do happen. You never know when you might unexpectedly find yourself face to face with a FATTY. Most FATTY  encounters do not result in an attack, but precautions should be taken just the same. It is better to be prepared, than to be left defenseless.  When confronted with a FATTY, try to determine whether it is a black FATTY or a grizzly FATTY, this will direct your plan of defense. If you are able, stop, quickly and quietly back off and walk away from the animal, talking in a low tone the entire time. If it is a female with cubs nearby, try not to come between them, as this will only upset the female and make her more likely to attack.  If the FATTY is a grizzly, you should try to find a tall tree to climb, and get as high up as possible. Although it is not known as a climber, never underestimate the abilities of a FATTY. If you startle a grizzly, and it attacks without warning, your best option is to play dead. One possible position to take would be to lie face down, hands clasped behind the neck, and legs spread apart. Keep your backpack on, if you have one, as it will provide extra protection to your body. The clasped hands will protect your neck from bites, and the spread legs will prevent the FATTY from rolling you over. Another position to take would require you to lie in a fetal position with your hands clasped behind your neck. In either position, you should remain perfectly still, without making a sound, and wait until the FATTY has left the area before getting up.  If the FATTY is a black FATTY, do not climb a tree. Black fatties are excellent climbers, and your efforts will be in vain. You must fight back as hard as you can, your life will depend on it. You must fight because a black FATTY only attacks if it is starving, injured, or somehow provoked, and will fight with a vengeance. Playing dead or climbing a tree will not stop these types of attacks. Another option for warding off an attack is to use FATTY spray or pepper spray. However, this option should only be used as a last resort. The effectiveness of pepper spray cannot be guaranteed in this sort of situation. Air horns are also an option, although you must be prepared in case this tactic does not work.  Okay, so I just wrote this entry by replacing the word bear in  urlLink thisl  article with the word fatty  but I assure you, the threat is very much real.

      The July employment numbers wre released today. Select your poison:   urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,128209,00.html   urlLink http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/business/06CND-ECON.html   urlLink http://www.iht.com/articles/532875.html   Looks like payroll growth was alarmingly weak this month.   Now I'm not saying that this is all Bush's fault but it looks like Bush's plan to create jobs by handing out tax cuts isn't faring so well. He still seems convinced so though:  "Because of my policy of strengthening the economy while enforcing spending discipline in Washington, we remain on pace to reduce the deficit by half in the next five years." ( urlLink http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,127678,00.html )  Hmm, I don't see how permanent tax cuts, insanely high spending, and weak job growth is going to reduce the deficit. I mean seriously, reducing your source of income and increasing spending do not go well together.  Seriously, economically-speaking, the Bush administration has been one of the most liberal administrations in recent history. They're almost too liberal for my taste!    Addendum:  By the way, Bush's quote was "We're turning a corner and we're not turning back".   Kind of similar to something another great President said not too long aog: "prosperity is just around the corner". That President was Herbert Hoover and he made that statement during the Great Depression. He was the last President in history to preside over a net job loss.

      Hey officer. Sorry I just fatally hit that old woman while speeding with my SUV. I was on my way to deliver this fresh batch of cookies to the post office. I'm sending them to the troops. I support the troops. What's that? You're arresting me? But officer! You can't arrest me, what about the troops? You INSIST that I step out of the car? That'a outrageous, officer! I'll bet you're French. If you're not French, I'll bet you've been to France. AND YOU LIKED IT THERE! Odds are you like Michael Moore as well (Michael Moore is a socialist pig!). I am reporting you to your supervisor for sympathizing with terrorists, officer. That's basically what you're doing. By not letting me get to the post office, you're depriving the troops of the goods they need to defeat terrorists and A-rabs. How could you?! I know the problem! You're a liberal, aren't you? The downfall of our country. You should be ashamed! Now let me pass, or the terrorists and gays have won! That's right officer. Just go back in your car and pretend this never happened. You  may have let someone that has broken the law go, but you're supporting the troops! God bless you, officer! I'll get these, uhm, cookies to the post office right away!

      What has America come to when perverted religious teachings have infiltrated the state constitutions of the United States?  Recently, Missouri passed an amendment to their constitution banning gay marriage. In November a measure will be on the Oregon ballot attempting to ban gay marriage.  With 60% of Americans favoring a constitutional amendment this will be pass easily.  WHAT THE FUCK!  How could 60% of Americans favor limiting the rights of their fellow citizens.  What is wrong with gay marriage?  I'll tell you what Americans don't like about it: the bible condemns homosexuality.  People feel that they need to subject the rest of our country with their religious views.  The last time I checked the Constitution of the United States of America said that Church and State would not mix.  This has got to be the most blatant violation to our constitution I have ever seen.  We cannot allow a 2000 year old book dictate the way we live.  People have used the bible to protect slavery, and in the 60s some states banned interracial marriage citing the bible as their guiding light.  How foolish Americans will feel in 50 years when we look back at our homophobic actions.  Text books will describe how one president even tried to pass an amendment banning gay marriage.  As an American, I have learned that every person is born with certain inalienable rights, and that everyone should be able to exercise them.  And, today, Americans are trying to stop their fellow citizens from doing so.  "The objection to Puritans is not that they try to make us think as they do, but that they try to  make us do as they think."     -H.L. Mencken

      (click the title)    (as of August 5th)  That's a really interesting site that, instead of viewing polls in terms of the popular vote, breaks them state by state to display them in the way that matters: at the electoral college. According to their projects, Kerry is beating Bush by 70 votes in the electoral college. As you can see though, most of the states Bush has are states that he's holding on to very strongly. He's "strong" in all of them. I think whats going on is that, by adopting such a conservative agenda, Bush is bringing out lots of new voters. Problem is: he's bringing these votes out in the conservative strongholds. He's doing nothing but strengthening and solidifying his base, which can be a good thing for fundraising and campaigning but when it comes to the vote and when it comes to the electoral college, that won't help him. In this country, elections are decided by a select number of swing voters in a select number of states. Those voters don't really care about flip-flopping and all that other mud the Bush campaign is throwing Kerry's way. Unlike conservative voters, who might come out in droves if there are ammendments and initiatives banning same-sex marriage, Bush's increasingly rightist agenda doesn't appeal to them. But that issue still may be a factor since it'll bring out a number of extra conservatives voters who feel really passionately about the issue. Many people seem to neither oppose nor support gay marriage. They just don't care. They'd rather have it but they probably won't come out to the polls to ensure it happens. Many of those who are against it are pretty vehemently against it and WILL come out to vote. That means more votes for Bush.   Or maybe I'm just stereotyping and have no idea what I'm talking about. If that's the case, I'll just shut up and direct everyone at this  urlLink state-by-state breakdown of a much more important issue .

      Look at the sucka Republicans put up to try and bring down Democratic rising-star/juggernaut/heartthrob Barack Obama:    Hmm, I wonder why they picked this man. HMMM.   He ain't winnin' nuthin'. I pity the foo who tries to bring down the Obaminator! The last two suckas who tried got owned.   But seriously, I've heard some pretty impressive stuff about Alan Keyes. Apparantly, he's a master debater (lol) so that ought to be interesting. He's also supposed to be a master election-loser and I hope he decides to utilize that skill in losing his race with Obama. At least this shows that the RNC recognizes the threat Obama will pose to them in the future and has dispatched a somewhat formidable opponent to match him. Now I just hope Obama doesn't dissapoint this early in his career.

      This post will hopefully be a continuation of Sean's post on the other blog.   Sean Major posted this intellectually stimulating and artistically genius comic that he himself drew:   Mr. Major explained his masterpiece by explaining how he had pictured the US as "a slave to foreign oil some say". He understood that the US would always need to import some oil but reasoned that the American "economy doesn't have to be their bitch". He went on to explain how the dependence was not just economic and stipulated that the "dependence has caused just about every brouhaha over there in the Middle East". As a possible alternative, he pointed at oil reserves in "our own backyard" but noted that this sort of an observation wouldn't sit well with "Cheney the Oil Pimp", due to the fact that Mr. Cheney would need "to stack his cheese".   The discussion took off from there. Ryan Moran engaged Mr. Major in tempered political discourse, addressing him as "Sean, you liberal piece of crap" and demanding more clarification about "what kind of fucking alternatives to foreign oil" existed. He then correlated Sean's lack of clarity with the trouble the Democratic party is often cited as having in truly understanding "the issue before making a stand". Mr. Moran continued his scathing indictment with the hope that Mr. Major would be able to wrap "fat head around" the broader complexities of the issue.   At this point, Gus Jewell stepped in noted his agreement with Mr. Major's arguments, not that he had a "good point". He explained that while he agreed the Saudi royal family should not "the American people for profits", he went on to state his dissaproval for Mr. Major and Mr. Moran's suggestion of using "depleting limited oil reserves in Alaska", especially considering the fact that said reserves "only contain enough oil to sustain the United States for 6 months". He then offered other alternative energy proposals, including but not limited to hydrogen power and hybrid cars.   Mr. Jewell also made note of Mr. Major's obvious skill in drawing penises which lead Mr. Major to promptly explain that they are "pretty easy to draw once you get the hang of it". He also doubted Mr. Jewell's "6 months" claim, suggesting that more reserach and investment would yield more positive information.   Mr. Jewell then argued that domestic wildlife reserves should be preserved for as long as is possible, suggesting that we first exhaust Middle Eastern oil sources and than consider alternative fuel sources before choosing to endanger the environment. Domestic oil, he explained, would hardly solve the problem and soon the nation would once again find itself depending on foregin oil if domestic sources were exhausted. H  At this point, Shakeer Rahman joined the discussion and began by pointlessly declaring that he had "missed out on all the action". He then made a candid note of his distress over the fact that the first thing people were considering when brainstorming over "alternative fuel sources" were drilling oil in different places. Instead he suggested that the focus be shifted to true alternative sources such as "wind, solar, biomass, hydrogen cells, whatever". He agreed with Mr. Major and Mr. Jewell's argument that the nation was becoming too dependant on foreign oil and in particular, the Saudi Royal family. He backed up this claim with a few statistics about the extent of the Saudi Royal family's investment in the United States but the validity of these statistics has yet to be confirmed.   Mr. Rahman then shifted the focus of the discussion to oil refineries and explained that refineries were where oil usually got bottlenecked and blamed rising oil prices on refineries, making note of the fact that OPEC oil production was at a 25-year high. He even made note of the fact that "the Saudis have offered to build refineries" in the United States. No one has yet been able to figure out why he felt it neccesary to make note of this fact. He then made the more relevant observation that the royal family "offered to lower the price of oil around election season to help Bush win", promptly adding "I'm not even joking".   Afterwards, Mr. Rahman attempted to discredit all his arguments by noting that he was "more distressed about the power that energy companies have" than he was about "the power that foreign nations have". His arguments, designed to charge up the debate, ending up doing nothing but boring everybody. The post stood still for a few days before Mr. Rahman decided to post one more time. This time, he made note of Mr. Dick Cheney's recent allegations that Democractic Presendential hopefuls John Kerry and John Edwards were to blame for rising oil prices.   He continued with the following quip: "apparantly at a time when the Republican party controls the White House, both Houses of Congress, and have greater ties to oil companies than any other administration in recent history, it's two Democrats that are to blame for hindering their plans". One would imagine that Mr. Rahman took great pleasure in this joke of his. This has yet to be confirmed.     Let's try and continue this debate in the Comments section of this post.

      http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/03/opinion/03krug.html (you need to be registered on nytimes in order ot see that. it's free.)  The following is a very interesting article that, as the titles obviously implies, disseminates the widely-held and long-standing belief that the American media has some kind of huge Leftist slant. It's by Paul Krugman, an economist and writer for the New York Times.   Reading the Script  By PAUL KRUGMAN, August 3, 2004  A message to my fellow journalists: check out media watch sites like campaigndesk.org, mediamatters.org and dailyhowler.com. It's good to see ourselves as others see us. I've been finding The Daily Howler's concept of a media "script," a story line that shapes coverage, often in the teeth of the evidence, particularly helpful in understanding cable news.   For example, last summer, when growth briefly broke into a gallop, cable news decided that the economy was booming. The gallop soon slowed to a trot, and then to a walk. But judging from the mail I recently got after writing about the slowing economy, the script never changed; many readers angrily insisted that my numbers disagreed with everything they had seen on TV.   If you really want to see cable news scripts in action, look at the coverage of the Democratic convention.   Commercial broadcast TV covered only one hour a night. We'll see whether the Republicans get equal treatment. C-Span, on the other hand, provided comprehensive, commentary-free coverage. But many people watched the convention on cable news channels - and what they saw was shaped by a script portraying Democrats as angry Bush-haters who disdain the military.   If that sounds like a script written by the Republicans, it is. As the movie "Outfoxed" makes clear, Fox News is for all practical purposes a G.O.P. propaganda agency. A now-famous poll showed that Fox viewers were more likely than those who get their news elsewhere to believe that evidence of Saddam-Qaeda links has been found, that W.M.D. had been located and that most of the world supported the Iraq war.   CNN used to be different, but Campaign Desk, which is run by The Columbia Journalism Review, concluded after reviewing convention coverage that CNN "has stooped to slavish imitation of Fox's most dubious ploys and policies." Seconds after John Kerry's speech, CNN gave Ed Gillespie, the Republican Party's chairman, the opportunity to bash the candidate. Will Terry McAuliffe be given the same opportunity right after President Bush speaks?   Commentators worked hard to spin scenes that didn't fit the script. Some simply saw what they wanted to see. On Fox, Michael Barone asserted that conventioneers cheered when Mr. Kerry criticized President Bush but were silent when he called for military strength. Check out the video clips at Media Matters; there was tumultuous cheering when Mr. Kerry talked about a strong America.   Another technique, pervasive on both Fox and CNN, was to echo Republican claims of an "extreme makeover" - the assertion that what viewers were seeing wasn't the true face of the party. (Apparently all those admirals, generals and decorated veterans were ringers.)   It will probably be easier to make a comparable case in New York, where the Republicans are expected to feature an array of moderate, pro-choice speakers and keep Rick Santorum and Tom DeLay under wraps. But in Boston, it took creativity to portray the delegates as being out of the mainstream. For example, Bill Schneider at CNN claimed that according to a New York Times/CBS News poll, 75 percent of the delegates favor "abortion on demand" - which exaggerated the poll's real finding, which is that 75 percent opposed stricter limits than we now have.   But the real power of a script is the way it can retroactively change the story about what happened.   On Thursday night, Mr. Kerry's speech was a palpable hit. A focus group organized by Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, found it impressive and persuasive. Even pro-Bush commentators conceded, at first, that it had gone over well.   But a terrorism alert is already blotting out memories of last week. Although there is now a long history of alerts with remarkably convenient political timing, and Tom Ridge politicized the announcement by using the occasion to praise "the president's leadership in the war against terror," this one may be based on real information. Regardless, it gives the usual suspects a breathing space; once calm returns, don't be surprised if some of those same commentators begin describing the ineffective speech they expected (and hoped) to see, not the one they actually saw.   Luckily, in this age of the Internet it's possible to bypass the filter. At c-span.org, you can find transcripts and videos of all the speeches. I'd urge everyone to watch Mr. Kerry and others for yourself, and make your own judgment.    Oh and hello and welcome to the new blog.

      Hi my name is Shakeer. Recognizing the need to shift divisive political content away from my own beloved blog, me, and a few other veterans of my blog, have decided to establish a politics-dedicated blog of our own. I've had this idea for quite a while (in fact, I first made urlLink  misunderestimated.blogspot.com  in November of 2000) but just never felt that anybody really cared or was interested in what people like me had to say about politics and current events (very much unlike how EVERYONE just loves and adores what I have to say on my blog about myself). Recent political posts on the other blog have indicated otherwise. Consequently, I decided to revitalise this old blog. I'm hoping that this blog will ofer not only a channel for us to share information on issues we feel very passionately about but will also become a forum for discussion and sensible debate. In order for the latter to work though, we need your help. We've just begun and in order for this to be succesful, we need people such as yourself to post comments and join in. So please do. Please leave comments and discuss with us. Make sure to tell us who you are when leaving comments though. We wouldn't want to find ourselves debating paper tigers (Gus tends to do that alot). Whatever a paper tiger is.   Also, if you're interested in writing here, please shoot me an email (my address is shakeer(at)gmail.com) or just find and speak to me. Thanks!  And enjoy.

      After the Bush campaign demanded an answer from Kerry about his vote for war in Iraq, he responded that he would, but "would have done this very differently than President Bush has."  He continued by asking a few questions of Bush, according to CNN.com: "My question to President Bush is why did he rush to war without a plan to win the peace?" Kerry asked. "Why did he rush      to war on faulty intelligence and not do the hard work necessary to give America the truth?  Why did he mislead America about how he would go to war? Why has he not brought other countries to the table in order to support American troops in the way that we deserve it and relieve a pressure from the American people?" Well I have a few questions for Kerry as well.  Why did Kerry give Bush war powers without hearing a plan to return sovereignty to Iraq and restore the country?  Why did Kerry (as well as other Senators simply accept the intelegence they were handed, especially in light of the September 11 intelligence failures?  Finally, why did he approve a plan that was bound to cause an uproar in the Middle East and was largely criticized by many countries and US allies?    While I'd like to hear Bush answer the questions directed at him, it would be interesting to hear Kerry respond to a few of mine.

      Today Alan Keyes succesfully seized 13% of total posts on the Misunderestimated blog newswire and effectively established himself as the most posted-about topic. The shift came after Misunderestimed chief editor Shakeer Rahman decided to post a third topic on the twice-unsuccesful candidate for President and Senator of Maryland, his home state. The post came after Speaker of the House Dennis Hastert released his endorsement Mr. Keyes, as  urlLink related by  the  Times :   "I spent five weeks trying to find good people," said Mr. Hastert, who said he approached state legislators and the former Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka and Gary Fencik, an Ivy Leaguer who was a hard-hitting safety.  "I got down into last week interviewing a 70-year-old guy who was a great farm broadcaster in Illinois," Mr. Hastert said. "He decided because of his health problems he couldn't do it. You know, we were down  we needed to find somebody to run, somebody who wanted to run. And, you know, Alan Keyes wants to run, and I hope he's a good candidate." I'm glad his own party feels so passionately about his candidacy. Of course, I don't blame them, judging by Mr. Keyes' own foolishness and hypocracy, as typified by  urlLink this statement  he made four years ago about Hilary Clinton running for Senatorial office in a state she'd never resided in:  "I deeply resent the destruction of federalism represented by Hillary Clinton's willingness to go into a state she doesn't even live in and pretend to represent people there. So I certainly wouldn't imitate it." Of course, the Illinois Republican party had a statement ready to counterbalance this argument. According to a Republican party official in Illinois (sorry, I don't have a precise quote, I heard it on the radio), the reason that Mr. Keyes had changed his mind was that of all things,  9/11  had changed everything and that considering the current political climate, such a decision was acceptable. 9/11, yeah, that makes sense. Especially considering that one of the deciding factors for Keyes was Obama's stance on  urlLink abortion issues . Yeah, we all know how 9/11 changed the way people view the issue of abortion.   On the other hand, Mr. Keyes did have some other personal convictions in choosing to run against Obama:  "I'll tell you by the time I got through the records, I was convinced that somebody had to run against Barack Obama."  "I must leave the land of my forefathers [i.e., Maryland] in order to defend the land of my spirit, of my conscience and my heart -- and I believe that that land is Illinois."   Uhh yeah, that makes sense. Not really congruent with his earlier statement that he was running despite " urlLink a strong personal resistance ". But yeah Mr. Keyes, whatever you say!

      Fox News is officially my news station of choice. Why? Of course, their obvious conservative filtering and Republican spinning of the propaganda they consider news appeals to my desire to be lied to. Hah! Yeah Right! I actually do enjoy watching the O'Reiley Factor, but comparatively there are few hot women on his show. Yes, I said it. I love watching Fox news because it has the hottest newscasters in the world. Seriously check it out, they're babes.

      I am honored to add my first post to this amzing blog full of insight and talent. I am also pleased to announce the beggining of a new dimension of blogging (if it works). I will bring to the table extensive knowledge of the American political system, my credentials surpassed only by my savvy. I have recently met with some of the key players in our government as well as prominent figures in the American political scene to discuss the status and ramifications of current policy and politics. Names such as Sen. Chuck Hagel, Terry McAuliffe (DNC chairman), Dennis Van Roekel (VP of the NEA), Ron Nessen (Ford's press secretary), Paul V. Kelly (Assistant Sec. of State), Rep. Darlene Hooley (Majority of us are in her district), and Gov. Ted Kulongowski. Yes, some I heard speak, others met personally, one I introduced to a group before a speech. So, while I have stories to tell about them, they aren't even the top sources from who I have gained political knowledge and expertise (though the most famous). Anyway, I am liberal- but I play devil's advocate very well, if only for the sake of argument. So with that, I feel I have much to add in the coming election year and beyond. I am called to report my opinions and ideas to this blog, not for my own ego, (though that laundry list of politicans was kinda egotistical) but rather because it is my duty. My duty to the blogging community, to ignorant Democrats and fire-breathing Republicans, and to America at large. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I announce; this is Jack Arriaga "Reporting... for duty" (I also enjoy puns, sarcasm, and irony in my writing)

      In the past few months, liberals across the board have been tricking the American people into believing that their jobs are heading over-seas.  They site examples such as Microsoft, and Fujifilm.  These are two companies in the tech market, and they do happen to be moving jobs out of the US.  The former is a US company that has never seemed to care for the welfare of the American people, putting out a poor product, with horribly exposed security mechanisms, and the later is not a US company, hence the name Fuji, a mountain in Japan.  The thing is, Fujifilm outsourced jobs from Japan in the late 1970s to the Pacific Northwest.  They are now exploring other options in areas such as Southern India.  Now, to say that this is an epidemic is out and out lying.  Having spoken personally to Karen Czarnecki, the Director of the 21st Century Workforce, I can say that the US is experiencing a huge influx of foreign companies moving their businesses into the country.  Most of this is happening in the automotive industry.  Examples include a recently opened Mercedes-Benz Plant in Alabama, a new Toyota factory in Mississippi, and a Honda warehousing unit in Ohio.  Each of these installations offers thousands of jobs to the local area.  Other counter examples to outsourcing include Delta Airlines and its movement of 1,000 jobs to India in 2003.  Most people would say this is outsourcing of American jobs, but few know that by doing this, Delta saved $25 Million and was able to offer 1,200 jobs to Americans.  Its a net gain, but the liberals only want you to see the first side.  Between 1995 and 2002, manufacturing jobs decreased 11% in the US, while in China, the most industrious manufacturing nation in the world, there was a net decrease of 15% (16% in Japan).  This is caused by the 10-30% decrease in the cost to consumers.  These companies need to look to other sources of work to be able to offer those prices to their customers.  The Washington Post describes Kerrys attacks on the Bush Administrations control of outsourcing:  One of the first TV ads of the Kerry-Edwards Democratic ticket promises to focus attention on Bush administration policies that the campaign said allow and even encourage companies to ship American jobs to overseas markets, but economists argue the accusation is nothing more than political posturing.  The Bush Administration did not cause outsourcing; it was an eventual end to an increasingly growing problem.  And many studies have found that its effects were actually positive.  After McKinsey Global Institute perfomed a study on the issue, it found that for every dollar spent on outsourcing by the US in 2002, the total value derived by the global economy was between $1.40-1.47. Now, 78 per cent of this was retained in the US, in the form of lower costs to consumers.  That means that the US actually benefits from outsourcing, in the form of lower prices and increased income retention.  People are spending less money to get the goods they want, and the companies are saving money, and in some cases using it to offer more Americans higher paying jobs.  I simply cannot understand what is so wrong with this economic process.  Maybe John Kerry doesnt want the US to do well, maybe that is why he helped to vote down the nearly 30 bills sent to Congress to limit outsourcing.  One interesting point about this issue, and probably a problem for the Kerry camp, if ever he wins the election, is the fact that no anti-outsourcing legislation has ever passed the Senate.  Even if he were to pass such legislation, it would most likely be illegal, and cumbersome at that.  It most certainly would not agree with the World Trade Organization regulations, and therefore, could not function.   A word of advice, Mr. Kerry, dont make promises you cant fulfill.
