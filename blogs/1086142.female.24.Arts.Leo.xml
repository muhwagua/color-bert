           Aside from the bestial porn film my college friend so carelessly told me about while we were doing lunch,  another reason why I have a nauseated look every time I pass by a rotisserie is my introduction to "Frankenchick", the featherless, genetically modified chicken (I wanted to decapitate Eurydike when she sent me the Frankenchick image via e-mail).   How could you possibly eat such an ugly creature? Hell, this is not a chicken. This is a deformed, mutated monster.   I just love my vegetables

      I am smart...Or maybe I am just having an illusion of grandeur...maybe it's all in my mind~a false pretense to cover up all of my insecurities. I have made a lot of moronic decisions in my life, all of which I regret terribly.   I inspired my good friend Eddie Vedder to sing this Pearl Jam hit (our torrid love affair went kaput nine years ago. Even if my love for him remains at nuclear intensity, I had to end our relationship because of his incredible fame.)   (Well, I don't give a fig about my controversial break-up with Vedder any longer. I am now engaged to a sensitive, philosophical NC artist so who cares about (as Weird Al Yankovic puts it) Mr. Spokesman for the disaffected grunge generation. Eurydike can have him.)    DAUGHTER by PEARL JAM    Alone...listless...breakfast table in an otherwise empty room  Young girl...violins...center of her own attention  The, mother reads aloud, child, tries to understand it  Tries to make her proud   The shades go down, it's in her head   Painted room...can't deny there's something wrong...   Don't call me daughter, not fit to   The picture kept will remind me   Don't call me daughter, not fit to   The picture kept will remind me  Don't call me...   She holds the hand that holds her down  She will...rise above

      ~  USELESS INFO~      1. I crunch on ice cubes (my sole addiction).   2. I eat fish food at age four.   3. I once played a character in an independent film.   4. After hearing my college friend tell me about this porn film he watched which advocates the practice of bestiality, I totally gave up on chicken.   5. Eddie Vedder was in love with me.   6. I believe I am acquainted with the reincarnation of The Tsar of All Russias, Ivan IV (he delights in scowling at me in class every morning).   7. I ALWAYS eat cereal straight from the box.   8. I can eat a hundred dumplings in 60 minutes (which probably gives you an idea that I have a large gullet).   9. I am engaged to Superman (and his real name is Paul Ambrose. Clark Kent is just a screen name. And by the way, he's not a Kryptonite. He's Italian).   10. I am your travel agent for guilt trips.

       My friend Eurydike, a clairvoyant and a self~confessed female chauvinist confided to me about her encounter with a couple of vicious jerks who unfortunately she had a brief affair with. This journal entry is not advisable for people with no sense of irony.      Vicious Jerk number one: Orkhomenos~ He may look suspiciously like Johnny Depp but any woman would scream "PASS THE BARF BAG!!" once they get a dose of his narcissistic attitude. A high school drop-out, his pre-occupations include getting intoxicated on weekends and playing in a pathetic rap metal band. Orkhomenos is now married to an unattractive woman and is trapped in hamburger joint-convenient store type of jobs.   Vicious Jerk number two: Narkissos~He is one of those bad things that happen to good people. According to Eurydike, Narkissos is terribly good looking, fairly intelligent and very hilarious (he is especially hilarious every time he congratulates and glorifies himself). Eurydike confided to me how she used to nervously wait for Jesus to materialize before Narkissos and her while they are doing lunch and witness Jesus jam a fork into Narkissos' aorta. But I told Eurydike that she need not hear Narkissos sing Bob Marley's "Waiting in Vain" in Latin or have him perform projectile vomiting for her to proclaim him the anti-Christ. He displayed evilness by tormenting her with his devious ways and that is enough (Eurydike succumbed to a nervous breakdown after her break-up with Narkissos. Funny, I thought she was born that way).     "Dear egotist boy you've never really had to suffer any consequence/You've never stayed with anyone longer than ten minutes/You'd never understand anyone showing resistance/Dear popular boy I know you're used to getting everything so easily/A stranger to the concept of reciprocity/People honor boys like you in this society"   ~Narcissus Alanis Morissette

      I was part of Rage Against The Machine's political newsgroup for a couple of years. Unfortunately, it was terminated upon order of the U.S. Secret Service after the WTC tragedy because it was thought to be encouraging verbal attacks against Bush and the United States (which is, of course, merely a product of their paranoia). RATM's bulletin board has been inactive since September 15 of 2001 up to the present.

      Is wisdom really a virtue?    I hesitate to believe this because...    When Adam and Eve were introduced to the tree of knowledge, they lost their innocence and was banished from Eden.    Marx, a man who is high on intellectualism had the audacity to question God's existence.    And maybe not all of us have pondered on the fact that technology shall be the fall of mankind.    Ignorance is such a blessing.

      Sometimes I serge with power.  Sometimes I am unable to buckle down my euphoria.  Sometimes I feel really terrible.  Sometimes I want to go home.  Sometimes I hate my body.  Sometimes I want to love all my faults.  Sometimes I don't want anyone to look at me.  Sometimes I don't say what I feel.  Sometimes I regret what I did.  Sometimes I wish I was six.  ~Sabrina Ward Harrison

      I created a post about anti-atheism entiled "The Skeptic Tank" and quite a handful spouted their so-called intellectual arguments about atheism and theism. One dribbling moron who goes by the name of Grebsnig wrote this out of the subject post:   "Has anyone here read this fruitcake's profile? She claims to have dated Eddie Vedder nine years ago, when she was 13. Even that astounding age difference isn't? the most convincing piece of information that leads one to believe that this affair is nonexistence, what solidifies this as a lie for me is that Eddie Vedder would never date some dope who listens to the Dave Matthews Band. Despite my loathing for [her] moronic absurdity, [I] thank [her] for giving me a good laugh."   Ha ha...I'm sorry Grebsnig but you are not a winner. When I claimed to have dated Eddie Vedder, it was ABSOLUTELY, DEFINITELY and APPARENTLY a JOKE. Now, you are the dope because you didn't realize that. I suggest that you find yourself a support group for crackbrains.  Anyhow, here are some of the arguments that were presented:  1)Perhaps you can justify your belief in the existence of God, but how do you propose to go about justifying It's existence? There is no subjective (or objective? I'm not sure which word to use) way to prove God. You can say that I exist, so there must be a God, but I would tell you that my existence is due to billions of years of evolution. The point is, you can not give irrefutable proof for or against the existence of God.  2)Why must something proceed from something else in order to exist? Was the CED created? What created the CED? What created the thing that created the CED? What created that?  I am not posting all of the replies because they are too many and will consume a lot of space. Here is my argument:       THE SKEPTIC TANK      All of us, at one point in our lives (I am also refering to the atheists even before they became atheists) have a clear and distinct idea of God. But all of these ideas are the effects of causes. Then there must be some cause of our idea of God. I came across my old notes and read something my man Descartes wrote: The three self evident propositions about causes:  -there must be as much reality in the cause as in the effect -something can not proceed from nothing -what is more perfect can not proceed from the less perfect  With the help of Descartes' three propositions about causes, I therefore say that nothing could cause my idea of God as a perfect substance that is not as perfect as the idea. Although I could be the cause of my ideas of physical objects or animals or man--since there is nothing so great or perfect in these ideas that I could not have caused them--I could not, however,have caused the idea of God because I am only a finite, imperfect being, whereas the idea of God is of a perfect and infinite being. So, something else greater than me must have caused my Idea of God, something which is at least as great as the effect, can only be an infinite,perfect being namely God Himself. Therefore, God exists as the only possible cause of my idea of Him.

       For a moment, I want to STOP spouting my so-called intellectual ideas because I am not after all a savant (it is just one of my pathetic illusions). Today, I am going to post an excerpt from the book, "Letters to a Young Poet" by Rainier Maria Rilke.   "You are so young. You stand before beginnings. I would like to beg of you, dear friend, as well as I can, to have patience with everything that remains unsolved in your heart. Try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms, like books written in foreign language. Do not now look for the answers. They can not be given to you because you could not live them. It is a question of experiencing everything. You need to live the question. Perhaps you will, gradually, without even noticing it, find yourself experiencing the answer some distant day."

      I created another thread which, this time, tackles capital punishment. Unfortunately, it hardly attracted flocks of enraged, pseudo-intellectuals. However, I am still posting it here anyway.      DEAD MAN, WAITING      I believe that capital punishment defies the true concept of justice. I give credence to the notion that the law of retaliation is not a sound principle of criminal justice and that perpetual confinement is the better option when it comes to penalization. However, at one point, I have questioned the credibility of perpetual confinement and supported death penalty. I thought that probably perpetual confinement is worse than death itself because it denies the convict of his freedom to really live and possibly even subjecting him to condemnation by his family/friends. But then, after a series of cases of people who were put to death and later were acquitted and proven innocent, I ended up declining to consider the idea of capital punishment...   ...now, I consider it as nothing but a screwed up, ancient concept of savageness.

      I am consumed by depression and my room is SO dark, I can't stand to stay even one minute there. It is funny how some of the people I know in art school glorify depression and view it as a "rockstar's disease" and they are all dying to wallow in it. Pathetic.

      All day Staring at the ceiling making Friends with shadows on my wall All night I'm hearing voices telling me That I should get some sleep Because tomorrow might be good For something  Hold on I'm feeling like I'm headed for a Breakdown I don't know why  See me Talking to myself in public And dodging glances on the train I know I know they've all been talking 'bout me I can hear them whisper And it makes me think there must be something wrong with me  I'm not crazy I'm just a little unwell I know right now you can't tell But stay awhile and maybe then you'll see A different side of me I'm not crazy I'm just a little impaired I know right now you don't care But soon enough you're gonna think of me  And how I used to be   ~UNWELL Matchbox 20

              RIGHTEOUS ROSE   (that's me...according to the Gilette quiz)  Ever notice that little thorn in your side? Wouldn't surprise us one bit with the way you feel about issues near and dear to your heart. But just because you're dedicated to your causes — from treating friends fairly to helping out those in need — doesn't mean you're reckless. In fact, far from it. That's part of your charm.  You're the type willing to help shape change, whether it be writing your Congressman or simply asking the local video store clerk why they don't shelve a better selection of new releases. If something nabs your attention — be it an unfair grade or a hot new shade of lipstick — you're probably not too shy to stand up and let your opinion be known. After all, nobody ever got anywhere by sitting on their hands and staying quiet.  In short? With your rose shade of passion, you've got "leader" written all over you. You know how to guide a team to victory with a dose of diplomacy thrown in for good measure. So keep it up with your righteous self!

      I went to the flea market Sunday and bought hispter panties for myself and a lacy, barely-there thong for Eurydike. I am sure my mother was flabbergasted that I purchased this "obscene, only-for-whores" undergarment for my infamous maid of honor. Seriously, the problem with my mother is, she's oblivious to the fact that every human being is a sexual being and I, her 22 year old daughter hardly has any conservative leanings. When I started dating Paulie, she probably began contemplating in her popularly supposed "decent" head a lot of obscene, sexual things that she suspects I am doing with him. She is probably secretly loathing the fact that I am marrying an older man who is absolutely very experienced in bed. I recall how she would bash the Vladimir Nabokov book, "Lolita" saying it's obscene and indecent. And I told her, "But seriously, I think I have become Lolita." I swear she morphed into a rock when I said that.  ...Then The Police began singing, "Don't Stand So Close To Me" in my head.

      Out of sheer boredom, I took a few of Quizilla's quizzes. Here are the results of my personality test:     urlLink       Take the  urlLink What High School Stereotype Are You?  quiz, by  urlLink Angel    True.  Here's another one:       You are every secretary's nightmare    urlLink   Which Ultimate Beautiful Woman are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Uh oh. Paul will decapitate me.      You're depressed. Really you are. And you definitely have a reason. You often space out and stare at things blankly, even if you're normally hyper and energetic. This is because nothing really seems important anymore. You might just be sad right now, or you might be manic depressive. Don't worry. Have some cocoa and stuff'll be ok.    urlLink   How Depressed are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Cocoa makes me choke.    This journal entry is dedicated to Jandi Marie.

      I was extremely depressed this afternoon that I sat in the bathtub, soaking in the salted water. A thin line of rust stained the root of the silver hand rail and part of the beige porcelain. It appeared as if the silver hand rail bled caramel and stained the tub forever. I let my limbs float on the water, my toes bobbing up and down like tiny red submarines. Then, I got bored, sat up and assumed a fetal position.  After not speaking with Eurydike for nearly 15 days, a result of my annoyance because of her wanton ways, I called her up finally last night and we ended up discussing her urogenital infection and how she spent a handsome amount of money on suppository. She's still casting blame on the chauvinistic cretin, her "male whore", for her urogenital problem which she is incredibly ashamed of.  The X-Files episode last night was brilliant. I wonder if they have grilled chicken guts in Quantico, Virginia (yes, chicken meat nauseates me but I am a huge fan of grilled chicken guts---a Filipino delicacy usually sold in side streets.)

      I just found out today that I am 1,186 weeks old....WOW!!!!  I took the Freud test and this is the result (I know I am a quiz junkie. So you want to kick my behind for that?) "Louella, Freud would say your strongest unconscious conflict stems from events that happened when you were an Infant.  He would also conclude that relative to others, your personality today is moderately affected by the events of your childhood. It appears that your biggest unconscious conflict that still afflicts you stems from what Freud defined as the oral stage of development that occurred when you were less than a year and a half old. Freud would say that this conflict can manifest in your personality by giving you a tendency to be passive in certain circumstances. You may also have unusual eating habits or tastes. This normally happens when parents discourage a child from sucking on things past a certain age — this behavior is called "underindulgence" and the child naturally reacts with feelings of guilt or lowered self-worth. Freud defined five psychosexual developmental stages that everyone goes through on their way from infancy to adolescence. And each of those stages is associated with adult personality traits. At each stage, we all had to overcome certain "conflicts" or hurdles as we learned new skills and developed relationships with others. No one gets through all five stages without having trouble with at least one of them. And it's this unresolved "trouble" that Freud encouraged people to travel back to, recognize, and overcome.

      My friend Jandi designed a Bolt Ad using some program which is yet unknown in my planet (I am an inhabitant of a planet that is SO lowbrow, people regard magical realism as some sort of a sacred message from the heavens.) Unfortunately, the URL of her design for some reason is currently inactive and would hardly show up on this page. Her Ad is animated. I am such a sucker for animated GIF images but, darn it, I don't know how to create one. Which makes me want to decapitate Jandi for being such a genius.

      I was the maid of honor at my cousin Gemma's wedding last 3rd of May.  Gemma was constantly bawling her eyes out and I am not sure if it's out of happiness, unhappiness or fear. The bridal bouquet landed on my face and no one was thrilled when it did. That was the fourth bridal bouquet for me and contrary to the rumors, I did not hit the bridesmaid standing right next to me square in the face just so I could have the stupid bouquet (although I nearly had done than. She was casting stabbing glares at me the whole time at the reception). The bouquet chose me.

      Here is a "campfire tale" I wrote to earn Bolt's Smorz badge        PHANTOM SHIVA    7:14 AM. Friday. She marched toward a bicycle chained to the mailbox post and with quivering, blue fingers unfastened the lock with the solitary key hanging from her sterling chain necklace. The rain was pouring incessantly, licking the make-up off her face,her eyes appeared as if it were bleeding caramel. She rode the bicycle and pedaled hard, bracing through the heavy downpour. In the same breath, without warning a vehicle shot out into the street. The engine screeches to a halt. Shattered glasses flew. A car alarm went off. And behind the cloudy haze, a body laid twisted agonizingly by the pavement. The road was the color of blood.  He was sitting in the corner booth in some lonely cafe, fingering his half eaten bagel. The clock on the wall read half past eight. Out of overwhelming boredom, he rose from his seat, gathered his books and left a message at the counter. He put on his coat and under the rain, walked back to the dormitory.  9:12 AM. She found him curled up on the couch, his right foot bobbing up and down to the beat of a Bob Marley song. "I left Coffee World. 'Can't stand the cold.", he mumbled under his breath. "I hate the rain." was all she responded and crouched by the fire. Her hair was still dripping. "Shiva," he said, "I'll meet you after History class." and gathered his coat resting atop a battered console chair. "6:30", she whispered. "6:30.", he echoed.  6:34 PM. He was stranded in Luxemburg Hall, the water flooded the quadrangle situated infront of the building by 3 feet. He was beginning to grow frustrated and contemplated an excuse. The sound of footsteps padding down the hallway distracted him from his vacation. He turned around. "Professor Rausch." he greeted. "Keith, how are you doing." the man responded. "Have you heard of what happened...this morning...to your friend, Shiva." The boy returned a bewildered stare.   "She met an accident at Francis Street..."  "You are mistaken Professor Rausch..."  "I'm sorry, Keith, she's gone. Severe hemmorhage. The paramedics concluded she passed away a few minutes after the accident. The memorial service will be at Saint Joseph. Let me take you..."

      I was so ill last weekend that I started hallucinating. The white mug resting on top of my dresser began to morph into David Draiman's face (the band Disturbed's frontman). Why he? I would have appreciated it more if it was Chad Kroeger's .But I surmise that if that happened, I would have mistaken Chad for Jesus Christ and proclaim myself a visionary. Then, my parents will start really believing that I am a delusional loon.    But I am!         Chad Kroeger. Jesus Christ's reincarnation. Scary.   (...at the back of my head, I could hear the dead nun directress from my old catholic elementary school chanting, "Blasphemy, blasphemy, blasphemy...")  I can't believe they included Chad in the site "1000 People More Annoying Than Mick Hucknall" (Mick of Simply Red.) One person said that Chad resembles a German Porn Star.   People who watch German Porn aggaravates me.

      Today, I am officially 719,094,168 seconds old!  Yet another E-Mode personality test        Political World   You like to be involved in things, you don't want to just sit back and watch them happen. Chances are, you're also driven by your ideals and want to really make a difference in the work that you do. But that doesn't mean you're unrealistic. In fact, you, more than some, probably have a really good grasp on the inner workings of people's minds — since you might find yourself trying to anticipate their actions to accomplish your goals.  When you have strong opinions, you might find yourself faced with some opposition, but don't let that dissuade you from your convictions. If your ideas matter to you, they probably matter to others too. So what are you waiting for? Climb aboard your next cause and start shaking things up!  You're destined to find fame and fortune in the political world of power, strategy, and negotiations. You're a leader for change, whether you want to become the youngest mayor of your town, diplomatic attaché to Chile, think tank strategist, or even leader of the free world. (Sorry, All-Powerful Ruler of the Universe might be a little much.) The Revolution awaits! So make a difference in the environmental world, or the democratic world, or the republican world, or the women's rights world, or the animal rights world, or...

      Science brings truth. It has been said that time, space and distance are non-existent entities and are nothing but false belief. Gradually this theory is being proven unfabled after the discovery of various technology (...internet, telephone...).  When I am bored, I yak.

      I want to shave my head, get clad in an orange robe, wear prayer beads around my neck, take early morning walks barefoot, eat nothing but greens and light incense when I am depressed.        Beautiful.  The catholic church is frustrating me.

           My school destiny is...  Rebel  You don't want to be defined by others, which is why you probably like standing out from the crowd and doing your own thing. That's why we can see why you might roll your eyes when the homecoming court gets announced over the PA system, or when the clique of girls in matching outfits and hairstyles bumps into you in the hallway without excusing themselves. But that's OK, because you know that ultimately you're just ahead of your time. You know you don't have to go with the flow to get somewhere in life. You discovered earlier than some that there's something to be said for marching to the beat of a different drummer.  You know that you don't have to wear a leather jacket or ride a motorcycle to make the rebel list at your school. While you might not fit the typical mold, it doesn't mean your talents don't fit in the student body. Want to call out your original views this year? How about starting your own 'zine or Web site — and maybe recruit a few friends to help you out. It's a great way to express some of your unique ideas and inspire others to think for themselves.

       Here is a post I replied to at Bolt.com's boards      HarryPotter1219  16/M/US  Jul 27 2003 1:47AM   bolt sucks becuz they find ppl who have crushes on their best friends way more important than ppl who need advice on how 2 stop some big bad ass insurance company from buyin all our neighborhood's land at a non fair market value. which will mean, all my neighbors and my family will have 2 move, and most of us who r already in debt will b screwed even more when our lands r worth way over $100,000 and we're only getting about 60000. bolt finds a school boy crush WAY more important. another reason bolt sucks, it's slow! another reason bolt sucks, 2 many dam popups! another reason bolt sucks, it's monitors and staff members suck at their jobs. so mayb if bolt satisfyed some ppl it wouldn't suck so bad!       BlueAutumn  (...my bolt handle)  22/F/KN  Jul 27 2003 2:02AM   Well, Harry, you should realize that Bolt does not suck considering that it allowed you to air your personal angst towards some insurance company. It does not suck because it supports freedom of speech. If you were living in Communist China, someone would have already blown your brains off for merely voicing out your personal notion.  Remember that in most parts of impoverished Asia and Africa, people live in shacks, with no running water and they sleep on jute sacks and feed on dirt. All you, your family and your neighbors have to worry about is to move your shit out of your freakin' subdivision.   The world is way screwed up more than what you may have imagined. Quit complaining .      HarryPotter1219  16/M/US  Jul 27 2003 2:08AM    quit complaining? listen lady i know there's problems everywhere else in the world, but u know what, my family's in debt enough as we r, and if they change our land 2 commercial, and force us 2 sell, we might end up in a fucking shack 2! now i've yelled at enough ppl 2day, please dont b added 2 my hate list     *LOL* He can add me to his hate list and my world will go on turning.    Kids...

      The "renegade soldiers" staged a mutiny, Sunday 27 July 2003, in Metro Manila, hoping to overthrow the current administration.  Funny thing is, most of the nation men were nonchalant. In this country, coup d'etat is as common as corruption, calamities, terrorism, street beggars sunbathing by the pavements, deep fried one-day-old chicks being peddled on the street corners, Mexican soap operas...    don't you just love this country?

           I love fearlessly and in huge, deep ways. I share my colors. I wait patiently for everything that remains unsolved in my heart. I am in love with deep life questions and I listen to myself deep down. I live it all--the doubt, the desire, the overwhelming ache. I let my mind take me so far away. I welcome wide hugs and the exclamation of delights. I don't hide behind masks and I forgive myself because I am all I have. I appreciate decadence in a creative way.    Blah. I hate writing "boost your ego" essays.

      I have something similar to "Go Away" posted on my bedroom door (I  spend half of the day sitting on my bed, reading J.D. Salinger, Eugenides or Lightman. On better days when I am not "cerebrally impaired", I go to Kierkegaard or Descartes) However, no matter how they try to trick me to get out of my bedroom, my nonchalance is just too intense. They can wail, "Fire" and I'd remain unperturbed...  ...I can always jump out of my bedroom window. Thank heavens for Copernicus' lessons on levitation.

       Meanderings of a Madman upon the Brink of Coffee Cup Truth   There in the space just outside his face convex or concave??....it didnt matter....was some light.....and the world was still real.... as long as he could focus..... whenever he decided it was necessary to prove it was out there......the world, the room, the walls encircled by the feel of his temples.....he could reach out with his hand and touch them......they were real.....yes......thats right.......they had to be........it wasnt what he was thinking before...... a lie he had told himself....that everything was a dream because dreams, he had realized, were not always good and in fact were very quite scary and very quite terrifying in fact..... the whole world might disappear before his very eyes .......and he would shrink down to the tiniest molecule teetering in infinite empty darkness......  Infinite being nothing to play games about.......no sir.......its not a dream he liked to have.........so forget about dreams....... and feel the strength of the tabletop and the chairs.......solid, hard, cold furniture........YES..........a coffee cup......this was the only world.......this would do just fine.

       I don't know anyone who thinks that suicide is a logical solution to ANY problem; and I don't know anyone who thinks that suicide should be encouraged.  I do, however, know of websites where people like this gather. Pro-suicide websites. People go there and give out TIPS on how to effectively commit suicide.  Imagine someone, maybe someone you know; in a very depressed state, for whatever reason. They are weak, vulnerable and open to suggestion. Helpless enough to try anything. Maybe even considering suicide already.  They then find a website that lists effective suicide methods. Dosage amounts. How to tie a noose. Where to go to do it. Where to get drugs and handguns. All sorts of handy tips.  Suicide is a sad enough epidemic as it is, without easily accessible websites egging this tragic behaviour on.  A member of Bolt has created a petition to boycott these sites. If you agree with the cause, take five seconds and add your name to the list. If you don't, that's fine, but at the very least tell your friends about the petition. Just copy/paste this into an email or b/n or anything.   http://www.petitiononline.com/nolists/petition.html   Thanks A LOT! Every signature counts!

      I am now employed as an English teacher at a Korean Languages School. This is my first job and so far I haven't found any reason to conclude that it utterly dull or moronic. I have my own little space--an office that is smaller than my private bathroom at home. But I love it because it feeds my anti-social demands.  When I was starting to feel that I am in love with this job, I encountered an odd looking, grotesque version of Daria Morgendorffer (despite of Daria's incredible distaste in fashion, I still think she's adorable...even just one bit) in the school cafeteria. She introduced herself, proclaimed that she is an anti-social (which made me wonder why she was there, offering me her friendship. I thought maybe because since I have anti-social tendencies myself, she had "smelled" me) and told me that she dislikes vegetables and is a Pringles-Pepsi type of person. She is extremely sarcastic and hilarious, a perfect reflection of myself so in just a span of 10 minutes, it appeared as if we had known each other for a century. We looked like an odd couple-- (who shares an emphatically platonic relationship...I don't believe in lesbianism.) she clad in her unbecoming dull colored floral dress and black sneakers and myself clad in my pink tank top, fat 60's head band and tall pink platforms.  I thought I have found a companion during the dead hour of lunch breaks. I was happy I have found P--- and was glad I am no longer alone (even an anti-social needs a friend...even just one). But to my disgust and horror, P--- sent me a text message at midnight while I was trying to get some sleep. The message says, "I am badly broke. Can you lend me P500.00?"  P--- is a bad girl. She doesn't know how to behave. Now I feel more alone than the barefooted bum on the street. My mission for Wednesday? Get her out of my once blissful life.

       My letter to PRA, 20 February 2004:   Dear PRA,  I finally received your Valentine's presents after what seemed like an eternity. I had to drop by the post office and pay the customs P30.00 just so they could prove themselves half-assed dimwits for thinking that the box probably contains a compact atomic bomb or a bag of Cuban weed. But thank you for the presents. It's like my little Sanrio Surprises box with all that Hello Kitty and Friends stuff in it. But of course, I am thankful for the boxes Saint John's Wort. Hopefully they will make me shake away all the depression that has been clinging on my head recently like hideous bloodsuckers.   --PRA also sent me Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar. They will all tell me, "Oh the books that you read..."

       When I write, I delight in referring to myself as the third person. Here's one example, a journal entry written during the dead hour of siesta, in my locked bedroom, after my afternoon shower.   She was bored out of her skull, as usual, for the nth time in 24 years. So in the middle of noon, she decided to drive dull care away. She entertained herself by letting out a screech behind the maid, who was at that moment making the bed of her 23 year old "duce". The victim reacted with a rather overboard gesture of fright, which, put a temporary stop to the practical joker's boredom.   I am adding an excerpt from Caroll's "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland", a brilliant piece of literature, I will always believe.   "But I don't want to go among mad people," Alice remarked. "Oh, you can't help that," said the Cat:"We're all mad here. I am mad, you're mad." "How do you know I am mad?" said Alice. "You must be," said the Cat, "or you wouldn't have come here."

       The following, I gathered from my notebook, written sometime last year. I posted this entry upon request of my friend T---.       I befriended an odd girl, T--- from room 314. T--- brings me to complete contemplation sometimes. I wonder if she epitomizes the typical forlorn girl of my childhood novels (which I never finished writing). She had long, unbecoming tresses of a depressed, overworked housewife, the clothes of a financially challeged country girl and the facial expression of someone who had gone through a litany of emotional bancruptcy brought about by abortive romances and bad financial troubles. She posseses the beautiful and scholarly yet naive mind I claimed having during my years in college, with the hopes that I would trick people---pseudo-intellectuals or otherwise into reciprocating my friendship.   Her shoes were white, the thick soles smudged with road dirt and its velcro straps almost losing their grip around her pale ankles. I knew I have seen those white shoes before and when I forced myself to ponder deeply where I have seen them before, I recalled seeing them in my mother's wedding album--she was wearing the same, exact pair under her wedding gown.  T--- is the brown Fiona Apple of my youth.

       The following "notes" were derived from Morissette's late 90's song entitled Unsent. I feel the need to acknowledge her genius because I am not a cold-blooded plagiarist. If she doesn't mind though, I replaced the names of the characters in this song with names of people familiar to me.    dear j---- I liked you too much. I used to be attracted to boys who would lie to me and think solely about themselves and  you were plenty self-destructive for my taste at the time. I used to say the more tragic the better. The truth is  whenever I think of the early 90's your face comes up with a vengeance like it was yesterday.    dear p--- I love you muchly. You've been nothing but open hearted and emotionally available and supportive  and nurturing and consummately there for me. I kept drawing you in and pushing you away. I remember  how beautiful it was to fall asleep on your couch and cry in front of you for the first time. You were the best platform from  which to jump beyond myself what was wrong with me.    dear s---- we learned so much. I realize we won't be able to talk for some time and I understand that as I do you. The long distance thing was the hardest and we did as well as we could. We were together during a very tumultuous time in our lives. I will always have your back and be curious about you and your career your whereabouts.

      I have been diagnosed with Dysthemia by the United States' Department of Homeland Security and they totally based it solely on the 45 minute interview conducted by St.Luke's (so-called) reliable panel psychiatrist. I find this definitely insulting. No one who had a brief conversation with me had any right to doubt my sanity.   NAMI (National Alliance for the Mentally Ill) says dysthemia is a chronic, but less severe form of depression. NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) says dysthemia is diagnosed when depressed mood persists for at least two years in adults (one year in children or adolescents) and is accompanied by at least two other depressive symptoms.  I am not a loon. Definitely.

       P.R.A. sent me a  Bens Fold Five  song via e-mail. I reckon he associated me with the song. However, I am not a crack junkie so that part is nonsensical. Anyhow, I think it's a brilliant song (is that my ego talking?)       Battle Of Who Could Care Less       Do you not hear me anymore?  I know it's not your thing to care  I know it's cool to be so bored  Sucks me in when you're aloof  It sucks me in, it sucks it works  I guess it's cool to be alone   Will you never rest  Fighting the battle of who could care less  Everyday you wake up late  Sometimes I wish I was that way   And you think Rockford Files is cool  But there are some things that you would change if it were up to you  So think about your masterpiece  Watch the Rockford Files  Call to see if Paul can score some Pez  Will you never rest  Fighting the battle of who could care less  Unearned happiness  That's alright I guess   I've got this great idea  Why don't we pitch it to the Franklin fuckin' Mint  Fine pewter portraits of general apathy  And major boredom singing...  Whatever and ever amen  Oh well, maybe not, I'll try again  This should cheer you up for sure  See I've got your old ID  You're all dressed up like the Cure   You never rest   Fighting the battle of who could care less   Unearned unhappiness   You're my hero I confess...

      I just had a secret conversation with God today at an empty, soft-lighted church. He was somewhere, everywhere. His breath was the soft gust of wind blowing at my face. His touch, the warm feel of the wooden bench against my back. As I turn my way towards the church's towering double door, I felt a sharp chill run through my shoulder blades to the tip of my fingers--a vivid indication that God was pleased.      Disclaimer: Let me warn you about thinking that I am some self-righteous fundamentalist--the type who goes to a midnight mall sale with a dog-eared Bible in her backpack, who lurches around the cathedral floor as an expression of her sheer and infinite religious devotion. I am a Catholic and while I am never a skeptic, I am terribly unorthodox. I don't go to church on Sundays or set an appointment for penitence. I prefer empty churches and converses with God in an informal, affected way, the way you would with a girlfriend. Amen.

        This is a caricature of my grade school directress Mother Loreto of the Alcatraz like Dominican Catholic School.  When I was seven, I thought nuns were God's interns sent to Earth to spread holy atrocities. I thought they were immortals...angels minus the wings and that funny illuminated ring circling their heads...the type Roby Rosa junkies used to wear in Menudo concerts. One dog day afternoon, I was standing in the school quadrangle alone, the maid 30 minutes late from picking me up, both of my knees smudged with classroom platform filth. Then there she was, a towering 5'10", clad in her immaculate white attire, her smooth veil revealing her pallid face and part of her white earlobes. Then I saw something that scared the hell off me. Her earlobes bore earring holes! Mother Loreto was human! What a cruel trick this dang Catholic School had played on us all.  Then I witnessed her pig out in all of our annual school Christmas parties, wave at the spoiled brats in their neatly pressed uniforms after dismissal time, a nonchalant, listless expression written across her face. Each morning, after the daily rosary, she would proceed to yelling opprobriously at the janitors, her saliva showering down on the pretty heads of Memories of Paradise nodding at her feet. I examined broken Jesus in His cross laying on Mother Loreto's bosom. He looked forlorn--all despondent, all disconsolate. I thought--why it sure is difficult hanging on like that  all wounded . On second thought, I pondered, Jesus' sorry disposition was possibly inspired by the toxic combination of Mother Loreto's halitosis and constitutional viciousness.  It was then that I learned my first lesson on  irony .
