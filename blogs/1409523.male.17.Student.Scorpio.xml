      BATS! BATS! BATS! BATS! yes..... we may have bats... those flying rodents i hold so near and dear to me ... in my attic... yes... i know bats are creepy and disgusting or whatever... it doesn't bother me.... i just like to have tabs on all the critters in my house... right now there are two ... my dog (teddy) and my brother... well maybe only one, my brother......but we could be in store for say ... oh i dont know.. like 50-80 more little critters... i think the only thing that i dont like is that they transmit disease and they poop all over the place... other than that ...... absolutely no problem.... now on the other hand my family has different opinions of these creatures of the night (well after hearing about this... i may have to give this nickname to Clay seeing as he may not sleep for quite a while..) in other news today i had a very good day... a minimal amount of effort was put forth in all of my classes which pleased me to no end.... no effort means nate is happy.... good stuff.... then after school i went to sheetz... my favorite hangout and got iced tea and altoid strips.... yes they make strips now and they kick major ass... then i went to yours truly and ate my favorite dinner, a dinner full of chicken fingers and "extra extra extra" tango sauce (if you dont know... you are not worthy to ask of the tango sauce... quite possibly the best condiment ever created with the exception of ranch or italian dressing), after, i went to swing and got my dance on .... fun times... well now i will end my day with a little bit of effort... mrs. brickley's homework.... good night everyone!

      wow..... tonight was interesting.... yeah.... so after school i went to a drama meeting..... and there was "Drama" as usual....... from upcoming prom plans to the usual dirt people dig up on others and there was also the issue of inductions.... im not even getting started....... so then i went to allisons and we (liz, allison, liz's two friends, claire, and val) went to Hunan Aurora...... well after i had a jazz concert and liz, her friends and val were supposed to join up with us there..... but they ditched me..... i dunno i thought it was kind of shady.... that left allison and claire to their own devices ... i'm sure that was interesting.... then at the concert i realized that i had an announcement and nearly tweaked out when it hit.... i mustered a little speech up and pulled it out of my ass.... but it went fine.... i just overreact sometimes i guess... i was cool after that.... after the concert i was attacked my family members... from the huggy optimistic and glowing aunt pauline, to sarcastic fun uncle dave.... don't get me wrong i like my family but they can be overwhelming sometimes... also on that same subject i found out a certain family member of mine made out with a certain drummer a few days ago... never saw it coming... if you dont know ... either a. you shouldn't or b. (my best bet) you  don't  want to know.... after the concert i went to starbucks with allison and claire... there we met a black guy named courtney (from aurora).... i dunno why ... but he knows mike pavis (one of the coolest people around these parts)... so im cool....and we were sitting there and claire began to tweak out ... she was going crazy...... the way she usually does when the opposite sex is around.... then we finished up and now im here.. and i think i will go to bed... goodnight....

      OH MY GOD!!!! does this school year feel endless to anyone else..... i live my days now counting down the seconds til i go home.... i feel like summer is never going to come..... is this the eternal hell that i've been dreading all of my life?.... who knows....... all i know is that at least i get to sleep in tomorrow, which may be the first time in weeks....... god i love block wednesdays......  other than that there really has not been a lot going on in my life today... although in about an hour i get a hair cut... THANK GOD!.... now normally i don't look forward to haircuts with excitement, but i feel like someone took a dog (the long haired kind) shot it and stuck it to my head........ the amount of hair on top of my skull is overwhelming..... im not used to it and can't wait to cut it all off..... with that said i am going to end this entry..... talk to you later

      RAPED!!! thats what Mrs. Brickley's test did to me today..... i took it two weeks ago with about a days notice (i had missed four days the week before and expected to take it the next wed. morning about five days later).  but no she made me take it on friday in two periods.... sucks major wang... but yeah i've begun to give up in that class seeing as i can do no right.... whatever..... on another note the rest of my day was pretty good cause i had nearly no work to do.... today was a sit and stare and zone out day ... i enjoyed it very much .....

      Well then ... the mass for easter (i'm writing this late sat. night.. early sun. morning) which i went to earlier tonight usually is not even near fun... two and a half hours of god.... i dont mind church ... don't get me wrong ... i just get ancy as hell... sometimes i think i have a.d.d.  but anyways tonight kicked ass b/c i went and i sat with my friend matt and his family... his brother was holding a candle during church... dropped it and burned himself then cried profusely... fun fun fun.... then when his mom cried after people were getting confirmed, the kid who burned himself was like "everyone look, mom's crying!" and his mom said "he'll be crying after i punch him in the balls..."  ahh.. classic church humor... technically it should not be allowed in church but we overlook these factors sometimes... ha... then after church i went to allison's house... but got kicked out along with everyone else.... but it was all good because alana and jen took me to sheetz... quite possibly my favorite hangout, where i bought a frapp., altoids strips, and bagel.... my night was then complete..... and on a final note... HAPPY EASTER!

      Ahh....... Good Friday... technically it should not be good and all (seeing as Jesus died today) yet i can't help but enjoy myself.... i went to my grandma's as i always do today and stuffed my face full of as much bread, tuna, and elephant ears as possible... technically i shouldn't be eating in between today but my philosophy is if i never stop eating ill never be eating "in between"  ... lets see what else is on my plate... no pun intended... hmm..well i just got about 15 cds in from the library (if you are reading this lisl those were great recommendations... especially Mehldau) anyways so i should be busy for quite a while....i think i am going to sit down and relax now.. this may be the first time i have done it all week....

      Blog the second (well actually third)..... uh well i went to school today.... same old crap... i wont bore any readers i may have... but the day really got interesting as the fight escalated over whether or not i should go to church with my family (its holy thursday) i said i wanted to hang out and i didn't even have to go because it wasn't a holy day of obligation.... then my mom pulled one of those really shady... "well you do what you want to ... but i would like it if you come"  .... looking to avoid more crap for the rest of my life i went...... turns out we left too early... church's at 7:30 not 7... great so i sat in church tweaking out with all of this pent up energy.... then mass began and i found myself between having too much energy and falling asleep ... it was quite a weird situation.... either way this could have been the longest mass in the history of mankind (it actually was over and hour and a half).... i felt like i was going to explode by the end... then finally we left... and i didn't even get a thank you for coming .... you know like, "nate.. you made the right choice..." not cool.... then i got bitched at .... i guess you could say im damned if you do damned if you dont!

      HOOOAH!!!!!!  SCHOOL IS HELL EVERYONE.......... whos idea was it to give us finals...... A. Finals suck... noone normal studies ahead (we all know my middle name is procrastination) and then we have to cram like 10 subjects at once.. not cool ..and the week before..which is the eighth week, teachers think everything is done and we learn nothing (not that i am complaining about that part....) but during the eighth week ... WHAT IS THE POINT OF COMING TO SCHOOL!!! i mean i'm sitting in a hell hole all day while i look outside and see birds chirping and people going on walks and ill can think about is what great sleep/tv/lazyness/NOT SCHOOL i am missing.... HMPF! but there is a light at the end of the tunnel and that my friends is SUMMERTIME ..... in the everlasting words of Brad Nowell "summertime, the living is easy..." get ready to sit back, relax, and do jack shit.... that is the only reason i have some level of sanity right now... summer... the only thing to look forward to .... everything to look forward to... (it would help if i had a license and a car for summer too... but i am presently working on that.... i have to renew my temps... finish class... test... get a car and insurance... it could be a while... but i have time.. i guess ive waited this long... i can wait a little longer ....) anyways... gots to study for the last non-final test of the year... poetry.... wow....studying takes whatever meaning there was out of a poem in the first place.. kind of like a good book... if you have to read it for school... the enjoyment gets sucked right out... and with that... i am out also... stay well everyone....

      AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH I HATE SCHOOL !!!! I HATE IT !!! I wish (i just went to the matrix) that i could have the same experience everyday... ie.  come out of school and be like WOW i stunned (whether or not for the sheer shock of actually learning or the atmosphere) but i think that is just a little too much to ask... i think if there was a hell... it would be lined with school bathrooms without stall doors... annoying psycho dykes... classes w/ the Brickley... pep assemblies... and all of the assholes that make hhs so unique... wow... i better not go there... it sounds too much like.. i dunno .. REAL LIFE!! aaahhhhh  fuck it.. i have thirteen days of hell left.... and that is one less than yesterday... hmmm i think i am bitching too much.. but sometimes i just cant take .. i put all of this effort and energy into school and i feel like sometimes i just dont get anything back...and while yes i do know that there are many who put less into school that get about the same i do out of it... sometimes i just cant help being an overachiever... i guess i just have high expectations.... i dunno.. fuck it.. im going to bed!

      yes.... today was effortless... finally school is what it should be... (at least lately it has been like this) which is simple, no work, effortless....that is what school should be... not some bullshit about stuffing your schedule with activities so colleges think you are well rounded... taking ap. courses cause they are harder and you look more motivated... and then balancing these two things... which usually means many hellish 3:30 nights ... then trying to survive the day after .. and pay attention in class.. and be social... thats not what high school is supposed to be about.... thats what my life was reduced to for a few months back there ... finally i can sort of relax and enjoy the good points of high school.....actually... i shouldn't be talking.. i have a shit load of projects on the way... and well ... its ok though.. my middle name is Procrastinate... whatever... back to vegging out .... i will write later...!

      WOW...... today was much better than yesterday.... although i dont know if that is good or not... because all i did was go to church.. go to clay's dance recital, and do brickley homework... and if a day full of brickley homework can be better than a day at a party than well frankly i live a very sad existence...oh well....i've got my new cake c.d. (motorcade of generosity, which i couldn't find until the other day so i bought it.... great cd...i reccomend it) i've got my altoids strips... and my soy milk so i can eat cereal without dying from pain after (milk sucks wang.... it eats my stomach alive...) so right now i'm all good.... despite the gf issue.... i'm ok.... i just need to well... shit its one o' clock in the morning... i prolly should get to bed soon huh?  screw that... whats four or five hours of sleep ... jk... hope all is well with everyone (and by everyone i mean brian ... cause i think you are the only one who reads this... or at least the only who signs my guestbook) ..... maybe its good that you are the only ... i don't know if many other people would understand my ramblings as well as you do... sorry to anyone who may be reading this besides brian (highly doubtful) ....ok.... well i guess im out.... my body says stay up... PARTY! .... but my brain says... hmm tomorrow is going to suck major wang unless you go to bed... and honestly i dont need the extra stress... after... oh yeah ... i kind of tweaked out on thurs. and fri..... i dunno why ... but it was kind of scary... all of the sudden simple things like making small decisions and shit was kind of hard.... and bigger stuff like doing homework was ridiculously impossible... i was also EXTREMELY moody... i dunno...  i felt trapped or something... it was fucked up.. i feel a little better now... partly because i took a mental health day on friday and didn't do much this weekend except go to that party.. which if you read my last entry didn't help my tweaking at all.. but yeah... ok i have rambled on for about fifteen minutes longer than i wanted to ... bed time... good night america....

      ASEXUAL!!!!! ..... that is what i have decided to become... because god knows i am not going anywhere in the "people attracted to me field" so why hassle myself worrying about it constantly when i could just be asexual... it would solve all of my problems... no ass, but no depression... and seeing as the ass isn't coming... EVER.... i shouldn't worry about missed oppurtunities....there won't be any... so no worrying ... no depression.... that would be nice..... but no.... i am definitely still heterosexual..... so i am definitely still attracted to women.... and i don't see that ever ending... i guess i will just feel depressed all of my live long life.... hmmm..... i think i need to find something fun to do... oh wait... i live in hudson... something else that is depressing in itself... hudson=fun... oh wait... JUST KIDDING... living in hudson is like ... how to describe hell... well there is absolutely nothing to do and i don't drive ... so even if there was something to do ... i couldn't get there... and i won't be getting my license for a while because A. i have to renew my temps... and B. i have to go to clay's 8th grade graduation tomorrow (don't get me wrong ... its cool and all ... but i miss driver's ed once again... which goes on a 3-4 week rotation... so i won't be done... til mid july if all goes well.... which it probably won't)   anyways... what else... while i'm on this long depressing blah blah blah.... hmm... well it doesn't feel like summer yet.. cool huh.. i get out of school to go work at this hell i like to call theater camp and enjoy the great rainy cold cloudy windy weather... my kind of summer..... saweet... i love my life... if only pete and pete or south park was on right now... it may be able to cheer me up a bit... but no.... not even my favorite television programming is here to help me out right now.... in this time of sadness... i think i shall go on prozac... at least  i would be wired and happy... not so fucking depressed all of the time.... but i guess i would have to see a doctor first.... and the odds of that happening are.... 0% sweet... depression it is... i will talk to all of you later... have a GREAT! day.... *hmpf*

      AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!WHAT IS MY LIFE COMING TO!!!!! AM I JUST SOMEONE TO HANG AROUND JUST TO LOOK LIKE PEOPLE KNOW LOTS OF PEOPLE?!!  AM I JUST USED TO MAKE FUN OF AND TO PUT DOWN!!!!! WHAT THE FUCK!!!!!! HMPF!!  I am seriously pissed off... and yes... i know ... i don't have to go to school anymore for three more months but even that does not make me feel less depressed.... so tonight... i go to graduation... well actually i earlier i went to spanish class... last class with spencer marsinek... hes cool alone... but when there are others around..... watch out... his napoleon complex is selner-sized... so i am finally done putting up with his bullshit... making fun of me for anything and everything..... its not that he bothers me, but if i am having a bad day ... it doesn't seem to help... anyways so i got done with that... got a ride to bees in the boro.. ate lunch.... got a ride with elly to go home... all she talked about was her boyfriend and herself..... hmm... it seems to be that way a lot as of late.... then i go home...mope around... later...(i'm finally getting to gradution) so i go to gradution.... i was late to where we were meeting b/c my clock is wrong in my room... whoops... the people there were already mad b/c pavis wasn't going to show up.... then i rode down to akron... in the van... two in the fronseat.. me in the backseat listening to THEIR music.. b/c driver/passenger will NEVER let me put my music in ... let alone suggest something better of their's (as usual... i then sit in the backseat thinking to myself b/c god forbid i might be able to sit shotgun and actually talk to someone... and also am blocking out the soundtrack to chicago... I CAN'T STAND THAT DAMN SHOW ANYMORE... i'll admit i liked it at first... but i regret that.... ALL THESE (and others) PEOPLE DO IS LISTEN TO IT!!! i don't know how they can stand it... every time i drive with friends who are listening to this i feel like i am trapped in a hellish musical rerunish nightmare...... so.... we are on my way... and my dad's directions are complicated instead of the easy way i know how to go.... but no.. GOT to follow dad's directions (i'll admit he is usually good with these) so we miss the turn... then i point out an alternate.. what do you know... we miss that too..... and after countless almost turns onto oneway streets (akron is a lost driver's hell) and cell phone directions.. we finally got there ....but b/c the seating is first come first serve we get the nosebleed seats.. not even them.. WORSE!!! like i was so far from the stage... A. i was nautious (sorry for misspelling) B. I could barely see/hear anyone.... hellish... so then we had to sit through some shitty speeches and i made some side comment to my neighbor... and was answered with a SHHHH!!! it was so fucking loud......... i was like come on i was only whispering to you... then later i tried one more time... i couldn't stand listening to Mr. Howard aka. not so "I'm such a funny principal" without ripping on him and was answered with another HELLA LOUD SHHH!!!! .... so i decided that would be the last word i would say the whole night... so what happens then the person starts talking to me... i was light well thats nice hmm....so i just shook my head in response everytime....i was mad..... graduation went on and on... talking some shit about how teachers are good and great and they shape our lives and other crap they made up... with the exception of a precious few... most of the hhs faculty can suck it.....after.... we had to walk through all the obnoxious seniors smoking their cigars... after on the way to the car it was like "Nate ... are you mad?" "Are you sure?""What's wrong Nate?" and I said ... b/c when i am really pissed i just fume ..... NOTHING I JUST FEEL SICK OK?!!! then they pull that shit ... "I love you!... don't feel bad... do you love me... come on Nate ... do you love me?" and i just said yes under my breath to please them... the less the better... then they were all like.. "come on... I didn't hear you..."  AHHHHHHHHHH..... so i got them back and bitchin' went down about being hungry and somehow i lent them money to get fast food (mostly out of an attempt to not talk.. so i just gave it....) ... after the question "Nate... how far have you ever gone...no come on really how far have you gone.... "  the person who asked this already know and shouldn't have asked in the first place but did... adding even more to my depressed-ness by reminding me that NOONE'S attracted to me..... well except for so and so.... "oh you could have definitely gotten some of that ass" ... hmm NO i don't go for freshmen that are more like my sister or people who are stalker's.... NO... no normal people ever like me ...and if "someone" does... they are always like oh.. i can't tell you... well let me tell you...that helps me a hell of a lot... cause by my records that is NO ONE....so yeah .... hashing up my love life... not a good idea....unless you want a slap in the face or a really short short story.....then i get home and my mom starts bitchin' about teachers presents... i could care less... i just wanted to sit down and watch south park and forget that i have problems but nooo.. "Nate you have to decide on which for which teacher" and "Why can't you put anything into this.... you agreed on these last week!..... thanks for helping ... you might as well just go to bed.... GO TO BED!!!!" and that is where i am right now... i am pissed b/c of today.... i am pissed b/c of tonight.... i am pissed b/c of my love life... and finally i am pissed b/c i missed a great new south park where cartman's hand puppet is a latino singer who replaces jennifer lopez as queen of the charts...... FUCK IT ALL!!! FUCK IT ALL!!!! ....... i certainly hope you had a better day than i did... GOODNIGHT!!!

      AHHHH the opposite sex........ can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em and lately i've been feeling like i'm never going to EVER have a gf....... its sad that i have time to think about this and hash it over so much....... usually i'm so busy..... but with the school year ending and all i have time to think about things like this.... and quite frankly it depresses me... why oh why ...again... am i annoying .... completely and utterly disgusting? why is NOONE attracted to me.... its depressing to be friends with pretty much all couples... i'm sorry i bitch for those who read.. but sometimes i feel like a lost cause....well to end this on a better note... tomorrow is my last day of school and i only have one more test.... i should be so happy right now ...but ... i'm not... partly b/c i have a cold.....from relay for life... thats a whole nother story i will tell at another time ... so for now... so long...

      ah ha ha ha......... hmmm, whats up... its been a while since my last blog.... life is good... generally... i still have no car... license.. or gf... but whats new... its almost time for band camp....  hopefully this year it will be decent... in the past it has been one of those yin/yang.. heaven/hell experiences....during the whole thing i don't exactly enjoy myself... but after the fact i have so many great memories... and when youve been to band camp with someone you have some sort of weird bond.. kind of like war heroes who fought together.... its not always visible... mostly unspoken but definitely there.... on another note.... i went to a career counselor in texas... he confirmed my thoughts in telling me that copywriting would be an ideal position for me... i am happy... now i just have to talk to some people in the field and for lack of a better metaphor "dip my feet in the water" you know get a feel for the business.... i guess it is kind of cool because if i didn't like copywriting i have lots of other fields of work to backmyself up with, ex. being a novelist, screenwriter, english teacher, journalist, newscast, comedian, etc. good stuff... well not to cut this short but i have to go help do chores... blah blah blah... have fun peoples....

      sweet... my summer has just ended... why would it end so suddenly... BAND! .... good/bad/fun/hell band is all encompassing... its weird.. ill find myself hating it and loving it all at the same time... i feel well quite frankly bipolar...but all is good... i do have a five person squad... the latest member just added today... but i can deal with that...it is hard being a leader... maybe just in my squad ... you have to yell all the time... (not in a mean way) but while doing drills calling out maneuvers and etc., although i like the fact that i can move while the rest of the band is at attention... that kicks ass... oh.. but one thing does not change with my promotion to leadership... my HATRED FOR JOE Stevenot... don't get me wrong i try, tried, trying to like him... it just doesn't work ... between his annoying voice.... the crappy way he treats people and double crosses them (i will explain in a minute) and how freaking whipped he is by Zartman, there is not much left to like... ok so here is how he is doublecrossing... i am in parade block for the first time and i realize that i forgot my squad book (i'm not used to carrying one)... shit... i didn't know what to do so finally i run to get it ... when i get to the spot where it was i see steve running away with like 5 books in his hands i yell for him to stop and give me my book but he just kept on running.... (imagine a very short weasel-y looking kid running away with lots of books and youll get the picture).... so i get to line after attention was called and Zartman indirectly yells at me (w/o saying my name but i knew, although it was true that i should have been at attention rather than getting my book) ... we had a few seconds before starting to march off and i whisper a squad or two behind me "hey joe do you have my book, im squad fourteen"... "yeah," he said... so then i asked "hey can you pass it to me" no answer... again i ask... no answer... so what does the little cockmaster do... we get into the big circle like we do when we end and .... for lack of a better reason... i believe steve ratted (oh yeah steve and joe are the same person... sorry for the confusion... he used to be steve stevenot.. then changed his name to joe when he realized the name steve stevenot is retarded sounding...) anyways i think he got a kick out of saying "uhh Mr. Zartman uhh i have about five squad books here that were left"... immediately after he listed them and im sure the directors knew one was mine... i was so pissed... its a  little stupid thing i know... but that fucker took my book just to look good how flaming can you be COME ON!..... after i did find out that he had gotten reamed out the night before .... so i know why he did it... but sucking up is a poor excuse for just sucking in general....so with that thought i am finished with this entry, although let it be known steve does not phase me he just annoys the hell out of me.... i am going to bed ... goodnight

      Two Songs i feel like from the eels album Shootenanny:  Agony:  Am I gonna be alright? No I'm not gonna be alright Nothin' is alright now Am I gonna see the sun come up? Or am I goin' down? 'Cause everyday I'm here All I feel is sheer Agony  Friends tellin' me that maybe I need Some psychiatric help Yeah, they're always so quick to tell you Just how to get on with it I look into the mirror And all I see is age, fear And agony  If I could just remember what is was like When I was younger Before all the joy and happiness Was replaced with hunger Now all I've got to show For the seeds that didn't grow Is agony  ......................................  Lone Wolf:  I am a lone wolf I always was and will be I feel fine, I am resigned to this I am a lone wolf I am a lone wolf  Got my cares Wrapped up all nice and neat In my suitcase I'll take it down the street To a place with plenty of space for me I am a lone wolf  I am a lone wolf It blows my mind That people wanna try to get inside my tired head I am a lone wolf I am a lone wolf  I am a lone wolf Nobody needs to get too close to me You'll only see this truth I am a lone wolf

      sick... that is what i am... of school... of band ... of life.. ugh... i am also sick and my week has been miserable... but nothing can go right for me lately... i cant just be sick...everything has to go wrong too... every night its something else.. not like i could handle it if was ok in the first place... but no it gets slapped in my face when im sick... sweet.. just great....my life is amazing .... and i was also reminded today that my love life is quickly flushing down the toilet... or at least any parts of it that ever existed when... someone in my grade was talking to a freshmen....frosh goes "you've had sex?!"... junior goes "oh yeah i have... almost all juniors have, there are only about two kids in my grade who are virgins... "... ok i am cool with the not having sex thing.. whatever... im catholic...itll wait anyways.... but a little making out would be more than fine for me..... AHHH.... my lack of any type of action annoys me to no end.. well im going to bed ...because i have nothing else to do and it is 1 o clock... for those who read.. sorry for the bitching.. but it has to vent somewhere and i choose to put it up here....

      recently i have kind of been obsessed (well thats a pretty strong phrase) but i cant stop humming, playing, and listening to johnny cash's song hurt... i dont know why but i cant get it out of my head... which isn't so horrible b/c it is a great song.... but here are some other lyrics of his that i liked  "Well, you wonder why I always dress in black, Why you never see bright colors on my back, And why does my appearance seem to have a somber tone. Well, there's a reason for the things that I have on.  I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down, Livin' in the hopeless, hungry side of town, I wear it for the prisoner who has long paid for his crime, But is there because he's a victim of the times.  I wear the black for those who never read, Or listened to the words that Jesus said, About the road to happiness through love and charity, Why, you'd think He's talking straight to you and me.  Well, we're doin' mighty fine, I do suppose, In our streak of lightnin' cars and fancy clothes, But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back, Up front there ought 'a be a Man In Black.  I wear it for the sick and lonely old, For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold, I wear the black in mournin' for the lives that could have been, Each week we lose a hundred fine young men.  And, I wear it for the thousands who have died, Believen' that the Lord was on their side, I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died, Believen' that we all were on their side.  Well, there's things that never will be right I know, And things need changin' everywhere you go, But 'til we start to make a move to make a few things right, You'll never see me wear a suit of white.  Ah, I'd love to wear a rainbow every day, And tell the world that everything's OK, But I'll try to carry off a little darkness on my back, 'Till things are brighter, I'm the Man In Black."  RIP 1932-2003

      Coldplay - Life Is For Living (Bonus Track after Everything's Not Lost)  Now I never meant, To do you wrong, That’s what I came here to say.  But if I was wrong, Then I’m sorry, I don’t let it stand in our way.  As my head just aches, When I think of, The things that I shouldn’t have done.  But, life is for living, We all know, And I don’t wanna live it alone.

      HAHAHAHA... that is what i say to everyone who ever thought i would never drive... i laugh in your faces... haha... i finally have a drivers license and yes.. a set of wheels.. sweet huh?.... still no gf.. but life is slow and time goes on... i can wait i guess... but life is good otherwise... i didn't get into jazz one.. but i think that zartman sort of accounted for my massive extracurricular and academic schedule and decided he didn't want me to tweak out and die.. because all of the other kids in jazz band do nothing but jazz band... at least im hoping thats why i didn't get into one, because otherwise.. i got beat by two sophomores.. not cool .. but thats life... gotta roll with the punches... oh well there is always jazz two...and maybe it was a blessing i didn't get into one... but anyways.... life is good and all... and im happy.... sort of... but thats all i  have to say for the one or two people who actually read my blog ... thanks for caring enough to read it...

      so .... maybe part of the reason i can't think straight lately and some of the reason im depressed... oh yeah... you guessed... i've got a cold or virus or some other really really untimely flu going around.... i wonder if i have an immune system anymore... because i ALWAYS get whats going around...my mom will tell me its all these stupid reasons... but i just think i am prone to getting sick no matter what... its always at the wrong time too... not when i have a day off... or break or something... its on the day i have about 3 tests...ones that im not prepared for .... oh yeah ... that was today... so i was ready.. last night.. but due to a combination of the fact that i went to bed at 1ish... but couldn't fall asleep til three and the fact that im sick... well... i forgot everything... lets just hope i have enough other points in all of my classes to buffer my grades....  anyways...its like 7 and you may never hear this again... but i think im going to do my math and go to bed in like an hour... it might be a new personal record...i haven't gone to bed before 11 in YEARS... so thats it... ill write later

      what if my life was a big joke if it was all a joke you see could it be that everyone's in on it everyone, everyone but me they'd turn on the t.v. and point and laugh sayin' look at that huge italian fatass he thinks he knows whats going on  but he scarcely has a clue he beats himself over stupid stuff and daily tweaks out during school his life is monotonous and dull he doesn't know who are his friends he tries to excel at everything, but always in the end hes beaten by other classmates who do nearly half the work and when he tries to talk to them they are complete and total jerks so if you are in on this big scheme try to not to tell me what is up because if this is all a dream sadly it might be worse if i wake up

      well....  i went to swing .... which was a complete waste of time.. except that there were these two kids who opened the stage door... so JT and i chased them around school... it was funny as hell... i think they were really scared... hahah.... besides that no fun at all... swing = highly homosexual... and it turns out im not going thrifting tomorrow after all... after all that talk.... but whatever....  i hate my life.... why can't it just be vacation time.... maybe thats it ... maybe i need to just get away. away from all of this.....that would be nice.... but it would suck coming back and realizing that i just put off my problems... nothing went away... oh a vacation would be so great right about now

      so ... sorry i haven't written anything but that is actually good... because when i write its usually because im depressed or mad and have to vent my feelings somewhere...but i am back again so you know what that means....so i am a little confused.... my friend kathleen and i make up these names for EVERYONE (examples are bacon, sandwich, military police, b-hole, railroad, el douche, e.t., bubba king, p. titty, penis, jew, and vag)... and one of our friends left us at the table in buffalo so we named her the deserter... just kidding around and all... but the weird thing is she does it all of the time now (in different situations though)... i dont know... maybe i just think too much... but its really weird...if she doesn't like us i would be more than fine knowing that.... just tell us and not leave us hanging ... whatever.... anyways school blows... i want to GRADUATE... but no ... some gay ass way back when decided we need 13 and not just 12 years of school... damn.... i feel like all of the time, stress, pain, and anxiety i spend on school isn't even worth it.... really... its so stupid... all of this work just to get into college... and then all of college working just to get some shitty job in a bland, boring, depressing cubicle, where i will work until i wither and die (dear god i hope not... i pray to god i get into a fun ad agency where i can be a copywriter).... life seems so pointless sometimes ... you know?..... i think i should be able to stay home all day... enjoy myself... have time to excercise WELL (not just a late night run where i freeze my ass off)...get together with my friends.... do things i have always wanted to do... from learning guitar.... to just doing art ALL of the time....  i feel like i am a prisoner of an unjust system of education....its not fair.... and i dont care if you say EVERYONE needs to learn... EVERYONE else goes to school.... why am i the only who feels that school has been robbing me of my childhood and teen years.... instead spitting back some shitty mixed up life where sleep depravity and mental breakdowns are so frequent it seems im not living at all... just suffering... floating through a sad stressful day that i never wanted to begin in the first place... ok.... thats it ...enough for today.... i feel a little better.... off to swing for a shitty concert where everyone will smile and tell me how good i am and pretend that they actually care

      just kidding... uh kind of... yeah so teachers might strike tomorrow... sweet... not really ... i am kind of mixed about it.. if they are going to strike its probably better now, before seniors have to have their apps. in .... but I would like it if they striked because i would have to do absolutely nothing... last time we had a strike... i did jack shit and it was sweet.... yeah.. but then there is my ap test in the spring and i dont want to get fucked over... so maybe a stirke isn't a good thing... hmm... i dunno... what happens happens... today was decent.... i was inside for band and all other classes required a minimal amount of effort... so i was happy ... yeah.... ok... i have to go do hw before i go to swing... swing..  fun times.. jk... im done  Nate

      wow... who knew that my little bit of hw would last til when ... 4AM!!! HOLY CRAP.... i was most definitely floating through the school day today... its not good when you have spurts of zoning out... only to realize that you ACTUALLY are at school... i felt like i was meditating or something... like i had just reached enlightenment only without all the holy monk stuff... seriously i felt very disconnected from my body and mind.... just like i said, kind of floating.... but anyways i definitely FAILED school today .. in the figurative sense of the word... i was sucking all around... two quizzes.. oh yeah... sure i could concentrate .. oh wait.. me concentrate... i dont think so.... but all is said and done and that is behind me now.. so i think im going to start my hw early tonight and get to bed earlier... i dont think i am going to swing either... if i did im sure i would have some sort of epilectic seizure... pass out and die...

      dammit....... just when you thought life was going good... it slaps you in the face.... holy shit....i am so sick of this.....it always seems to be that whenever i like someone...its always hey let me talk about someone ELSE that i like with you.. or let me cry on your shoulder and all that bullshit... BOO FUCKING HOO... hell ill have you help me get him to notice me theyll say..... wtf... WHY?! .... its always this way.. just the extent changes.. sometimes its just a minor infatuation... sometimes its fullscale making out in front of me... anyone else... i wouldn't mind.. but no... always always always has to be someone i like.... sweet .... sometimes i really hate my life.... just for once... for once i wish things could go my way sometimes .... really... i cant think of something in this same "arena" that has gone my way EVER.... really ... i just get fucked over and over and over... its a big cycle of excitement but ultimately always let down... and if you see me and im having a good day or im in a good mood... well then..know that that must be too good to be true and in a day or two ill be back to being depressed and mad... wow.... life sucks.. im going to bed... maybe ill wake up and feel better ... chances are no.... (the best would be .... something to the point of this quote by eels "I like waking up after a bad dream Makes it feel like life ain’t bad"... yeah i want to have a bad dream....) good night hopefully nightmares are on the way....hopefully you had a better day than i did.. really... no one else should have to go through all this shit

(i did get one like a day or two ago) i mean but i think i could still get something small and chotchkey to say... hey ... we acknowledge you are alive... but no... its cool.. i dont matter i know.... im out....hope your birthday doesn't suck as much as mine

      yeah ... so marching band its completely over... im sort of stunned... better yet shocked....not that i am surprised it is over or that our shitty football team lost 49-zip... cause lets face it, they suck... but i am just... well.. in shock... for the past lets see... 3 months... i have done very little besides band... and now i am in band relapse... what do i do on the weekends?... what do i talk about?... what am i going to do on wed. nights? now im not such a tool that i actually sit and think about these things ... but its still going to be weird not marching constantly to a drum cadence or getting ready for the next band event... i dunno... but next ill be saying whoa swing is over... or whoa the children's play just finished and yea... it is weird transitioning... but thats life i guess... but other things are still the same... im not  as  depressed lately ... maybe b/c i dont have time to be... but my dad seems to think that i am... hes always like "nate how was your day" (not in the normal way but different... i cant explain without vocal inflection)... or "why don't we have heart to hearts like you and your mom..." (simple... she doesn't ask me haha...) we do have them ... but then he starts asking weird deep questions ... like what do you want to do with your life... or he just simply has been asking.. on a five minute loop "are you ok nate... you sure... ok ... " (then he sort of looms and stares at me) ...now what am i supposed to do with that... i just say yeah... uh i have hw.. which i do... but.. anyways... uh gf report.. same as always...im still working on it... but results... no ... none... its cool... i guess sixteen years of disappointments will leave you without serious expectations.... but like i said i am working on it... i have faith that SOMEDAY i will actually be successful.. but until then (i still dont understand the fact that i have loads of girl - friends, but no girlfriend... make sense to anyone else?)... but times are decent otherwise... life is a bitch... but its moving pretty fast lately and i dont really have time to realize how shitty it is until im getting raped by something else.... so yeah.... im gonna go finish hw and go to bed.. its midnight.... night everyone...

      christmas time is here.... and so is the christmas spirit and time to be merry, but it seems to have passed me a while back...i am crabby, crappy and ill tempered right now and i really don't care about anything.... tomorrow is christmas eve... which i can't help be excited about... it is pretty much what my year builds up to .... but without it i dont know if i would have anything to look forward to at all... but anyways.... this christmas stuff makes me sick.... not the lights and the spirit and all... but the couples and couples and couples ....oooh everyone is in love... oh look mistletoe... why tis the season for romance....blahty blahbity blah....it makes me want to puke .... i dont know why... it might be because it makes me sick... or it might be because... deep down... i know that that's not me walking over across the street..... it really sucks not to have a girlfriend over christmas break.... someone to do stuff with other than the family... i have a few other friends to hang out with... but theyll be back at college soon enough... then i am back to where i was fending for myself while calling friends who can never remember to call me....who are out most of the time anyways... or finding out about how much fun last night was.... the next day.... do i even exist..... sometimes i wonder... because i can tell you most people could give a damn about whether or not i did..... i dont ask for much anymore.... really...this year.. i barely asked for a cd case and subscription to weekly world news (one of the few things to make me laugh anymore)  .... but really all i want this year is some sort of acknowledgement that i exist..... i mean it would be nice for someone to call ME everyonce in a while... i would love it if someone just dropped in to say hi... or just called to talk  (besides allison....who thank god....still does...what would i do w/o that....)... really ... just to know someone else even cared would be grand.... hell while im here... ill go out on a limb ... i would even like a girlfriend (like i haven't said that before)...im getting sick of this being single thing.... whatever...  i guess all in all christmas really sucks when you are alone

      well well faithless followers... i am back once again to wreak havoc in the computer blog world... or to vent my frustrations either way... so  yeah... swing choir... i used to like it.. but nooooo not now... oh why. why would you ask... oh i dont know... maybe because on a night when i dont even have time to change from going from a swing performance to national honors society inductions... oh .. oh .. wait for it... MRS FOULKES SCHEDULES A REHEARSAL AT FIVE O CLOCK ... thats not even enough time for me to sit on my ass... and that takes no time at all..... damn... doesn't the woman know how busy tonight is... im going to kill myself.... i mean i like her... but what is it with the inconvenient scheduling .. i always get screwed over and then my teachers are like why are you so sick nate and i mumble but really its because i do too much and then they pull shitty practices and then i am up late doing my other damn teachers homework.... yeah so its no wonder i get rundown all the time.. .its amazing i survive this year after year.... AHHHHHHHHHH IM GOING TO LEAVE NOW!!!! goodby

      YEAH finals are just around the corner! (im not excited about that... ) BUT that means two THREE DAY WEEKENDS IN A ROW!!!! so kick ass... i love it... if only i can survive this week.. then i am home free....so lets update since the last time..... uhmmmm.....so since last monday i haven't really done anything productive but i have been enjoying myself.... i stayed home on friday and just relaxed i watched some t.v. and read my cleveland mafia book.... then i went to pep band (ahhh yes... such a band fag).... well it was pretty fun i admit i didn't want to go at first but everyone was there... grant molly jeff luke clay fuller minar... it was fun... we played cards and the highlight... it was kevin bourassa singing the national anthem (with an english accent i might add) he looked confused too... but he sang ok actually... after we went out to chipotle .... BEST RESTAURANT EVER... i love that place so very much.... i mean where else can you get a burrito THAT BIG... then saturday i went to trumpet did that did chores and went to a concert with sarah and jen and katie.... the list goes on.... that was fun although i think besides sarah jen katie and kim i was the only other person who enjoyed it... lauren made a huge deal about the fact that she didn't believe in god and doesn't like christian rock and left... after i talked to jen for a while (im glad to have found someone who actually has the same taste in music, its kind of refreshing...) and went home.... then sunday was kind of dull ... i went to clit... um.. i mean C.L.T.... yeah thats right... and i had to sit through the most unbearable of speaker who basically told us that pop culture is bad and that were going to hell.. he was VERY optimistic .... let me tell you.... so anyways... this has to be short b.c it is pretty late.... i will write something more interesting than this later.. just thought i would bring it up to date... night ...

      AHHHHHHHHHH  i am on overload right now... art project... have to find a guitar to mod podge.... math project sunset and sunrise times... english project red badge of courage... a barrage of history notes and reading and to top it all off... I CANT CONCENTRATE... oh my god... i think im going to explode and today is only the first day back... i dont know what is wrong with me .. i should be sooo relaxed because a. i really don't have THAT much homework and b. swing is over which means no hyperventilating and cramming homework into a 2hr. timeperiod which is hard to do with 5 hrs. or more of hw..... anyways.... im out b/c i just realized what time it is ...or i just stopped pretending not to care.... either way im tired... im good... as good as i can be for going back to school... which is unusual... cause any kind of good for that is BAD.... but thats life.... im out

      god i hate hudson... i hate everyone in it (except about 5 select people who are decent and good natured) ... and i hate everything about it..... i dont know if i even have friends anymore.... really.... i feel that alone.... not that its a problem... but right now... my brother is pretty much my best friend.... there is nothing to do in this piece of shit town... school sucks... and my life is boring..... the only thing keeping me going is the thought that college just might be better... if it isn't.. i dont know ... i have no idea what i will do... i can't go through life living in a hell like this.... why can't i just be happy.... fuck even this little annoying kid i hate is enjoying life more than i am .... being a teenager is not supposed to be like this..... being a teenager is supposed to be about enjoying life and having fun and friends and not having a care in the world.... why do i feel alone, bored and utterly and completely stressed out/tired.... every fucking day of my existence..... i just feel like running running away... i want to run as far as i can away from this bubble of bitches and assholes.... i want to go to somewhere where people acknowledge their friends... where being friends with girls doesn't become weird because they read into it and where i can be myself and people actually like me for who i am.... i already am myself but maybe people can't see that i am decent... and frankly that i am human and that i even exist..... im going to go say a rosary...if that doesn't help cool me down... i don't know what will... god please help me.....

      wow... today was THE shittiest day i have had in such a long time... i don't even know why it was so shitty... i mean nothing horrible happened....im not sure.... maybe it was this weird feeling of being horribly lonely i got today... im not sure where it came from ... but all of a sudden i kind of feel by myself... its really not fun... besides that today was just long and unbearable and pointless to top it off... i honestly had no reason to come to school today... i would have missed absolutely nothing... but no... i got up... got in the car... and went on with my crappy life as a drone who attends school... because that is what i am told to do... i want to step out of the box... just do something different for a change... talking to people would be nice.... oh yeah... today also sucked because there was a serious lack of anyone to talk to/who wanted to talk to me......whatever.... i think ideally i just need a very long drawn out relaxing vacation where i sit around and let my troubles disappear.... that is not really a possibility right now... but i can dream i guess... all i really want is something out of the ordinary... i am so sick of the hudson routine... and the hudson people... who barely notice i am here anyways... the bubble is suffocating me and i need to get out... for now my light at the end of the tunnel is spring break/summer... but who knows if that will be soon enough....  signing out....

      i feel very alone.... i cant even really describe the feeling... something along the lines of being surrounded by people... but feeling utterly and hopelessly by myself.... lately i have been reevaluating friendships and even simply personal opinions of people and i feel that well i might not have as many friends as i thought i did (which was not a lot to say the least) and those who are my friends ... well... aren't very friendly sometimes... lets just say everyone looks out for #1... i feel like if i left/died/got sick... there would be a total of about 3-5 people besides my family that would actually give a damn..... i feel that i am sort of on a personal journey sometimes... like this is just a test...or that i am merely going through the daily routine... or sometimes that this living hell is some kind of sick way to encourage me and give me more character ... whatever the hell that means.... but anyways... back to the point... i feel alone... no one cares.... theres no one i can trust... and its miserable to have to fend for myself day after day... putting on a fake smile .... pretending im enjoying class.... saying hi to people in the hall who you know hate your guts but because people are polite you do it and walk on..... i hate fake people .... i hate this fake life that i live...i hate killing myself in homework and extracurriculars when i really dont enjoy school in the first place... i guess the only saving grace is that ocassionaly i get a trace amount of enjoyment out of a class here and there because they challenge me... so i put up with the extra work load... hoping that maybe ... maybe something will be good for once....anyways... i could type on forever but i have things to do tomorrow like my scrutiny .. that i have to be awake for... so im going to end this with a quote that perfectly describes my life, feelings and general overall condition....

      wow... what a fucking awkward week.  well.  I did it.  I finally got to the shrink and secured some meds to fix my problems (which amount to high levels of anxiety with mixed add, depression, and bits of ocd mixed in) yeah.... so meds.... most are fine... i forget so easily... some come with side effects... case in point.. effexor... i took it... it took away my emotions... im not even exaggerating... my life for the past few days has been a hollow void filled with random mumblings and trips from class to class where there are more people opening and closing their mouths sending words to my deaf ears... yeah .... thats what it was.. i mean tuesday.. had to be one of the most beautiful days so far this year... i could have cared less... i feel robotic... in every way except for my lack of energy which... oh ... can be accredited to effexor.... im not complaining really... because if it can solve my problems.. ill go through hell for a month if i have to.... (that is if the side effects go away like they are supposed to after a week or two).... anyways though... on another note... due to the meds i feel im losing my personality a little bit... im more laid back which i do enjoy... but my interest in some people and my ability to make others laugh has shot down drastically..... this is i both surprising and not at all... the interest is 1/2 and 1/2 because a. maybe with a clear head i can see who my real friends are/aren't and cut straight through the bullshit to a worthwhile relationship with my peers.... or b. with my increased grogginess at times.. i can be a little more irratible this week so.. for me to put up with people requires a lot... so ... i dont .... but the funny thing is a little more confusing... i dont know if just in my groggy state im less of a comedian because i cant think straight or because it took away my humor... i hope the first answer is the right one... based on the fact that humor... is sometimes the only thing that gets me through tough times... but oh well.. oh and on a side note... i want school to be over.. im sick of the play right now.. why because... in one word... drama...ok... ill add two more words... toaster.. and quesadilla... those who know... know... those who don't.... just ask ill explain... but these plust other added benefits of staying up late and having to memorize the same fucking line over and over again because rodgers and hammerstein are too fucking retarded to pick something different than "made in persia" "made in paris" "looks french" "straight from paris", etc. you get the jist.. its hard as hell to memorize the same line for different scenes... which is basically the dillemma i am dealing with right now... but oh well.. i better bite my lip and keep my eyes peeled because april is moving fast and i might miss may in the process of bitching....oh... i think im not starting to make sense because of the combination of late nights and antianxiety medicine... well.. off to a night filled with trippy dreams and thoughts of tomorrow..

      hello... whats up with everyone... me... i didn't go to school today... i dont know what is with me lately... i just come home from school completely drained of life.. yesterday i had swing auditions and went to chipotle afterwards to eat... so damn hungry... anyways i get back and i could barely get to homework... then i just fell asleep... it was eleven ... ELEVEN... what is coming over me.. so then i had a huge math test to study for didn't get a chance to do that because i was sleeping... so i stayed home... i slept until about one today... and guess what... im still exhausted... i dont understand it... and on another side note... wtf is wrong with me... i took the sat in middle school right... i got like a 1250 or something... damn good for not having algebra right?... ive been taking practice tests lately and my score is dropping... a lot... i took one today ... i got a 1080... what the hell... im just hoping its cause im really tired... and it is hard for me to concentrate when it doesn't count for anything... but i am really scaring myself... i guess well see if my theories are true or not come next week... hopefully god is on my side...   -nate

      haha... wow... swing auditions today... what a joke... i sang the oscar mayer weiner song... so amazing... i sucked... but everyone was laughing... my plan exactly... then after i went to chipotle and i DEVOURED a burrito... i almost got a second.. i was THAT hungry ...so good though... and to top off a pretty good day an ice cream truck ran by... i haven't seen an ice cream truck in forever... so eddie and i bought spongebob popsicles (they looked just like him plus they had gumball eyes... so delicious...) but that was exciting.. and i am feeling a little better depression wise... at least as of late... plus the cally situation is becoming more comfortable... i am excited to go hang out with her tomorrow.. i think we are going to watch "from hell"... this weekend should be interesting ... ill see if i can get through next week though... i have to keep thinking happy stuff.. maybe i can get over this shit... 1 more real week... thats it... im done... later...  -Nate

      wow... well first of all.. im not going to lie... im confused by this whole dating thing... i think i have been inundated with so many people and so many opinions that i can't think about anything else lately... i mean i've been thinking a lot about cally anyways... but i would like a chance to form my own opinions... i mean.. ive never had a girlfriend or relationship or even come close to one and its kind of confusing the first time... i do agree with everyone pretty much... but i feel like i just need some time to think... also... on a side note... this is really ridiculous... because this week and the next coming weeks should be some of the best weeks of my life.. i mean school's almost out... first date, first kiss... i should be glowing... but i am really depressed... and really groggy/tired... don't get me wrong i am glad about what is happening lately... but i feel really antisocial this week i kind of just want to crawl up in a hole and sleep for months... hibernate ... you know?...im not sure there is any reason i am depressed...probably just chemicals ... shit n shit... (maybe my meds i upped the dose... and am taking one 75mg. instead of two 37.5 mg.) whatever... i just hope it doesn't last because i want to be happy and excited and i really am but just don't feel like i have the energy to be... And finally... school... is finally coming to a close and ... for the most part... besides sucking huge donkey cock... is slowly getting better and by that i mean... its almost done so i guess i can put up with it for now... lets hope i make it to the end because... while it may only be 9 days or something like that... i dont know if i can hang on that long... ok... im going to get some sleep.. and maybe... ill be myself tomorrow... pray for me...

      wow...things have seemed to just turn around for me in the last week or so... school its all about slacking off right now.... i mean not that im slacking off just the hw load dropped exponentially and then by random (not completely, julie and i had a plan) the other night i was elected thespian president.... which may mean i will get the shaft next year if it follows the same pattern... but im going to try and break that curse... even if it means help from a friend known only by the name wicca-wicca-what?.... but anyways... also my meds have sort of calmed dowm and i am back to normal... its nice to be able to concentrate enough in the mornings to realize that you are at school... and whoa... here is the big shocker... which i am still ... quite honestly stunned about... i am going on a date tomorrow night... yeah... i know.. finally... how long have i been waiting... she is really really cool and really pretty and i am lucky to be going ... im not going to jinx myself by going into it any more than that... but i am so thankful that this time has finally come.... lets just say its nice to feel attractive for a change... but for now besides that everything to seems to be falling in the place and my life is sort of on a turn for the better... i am excited about what the future holds and... just simply excited about summer time too... finally happy...its a damn good feeling... im done for the night  -Nate

      so... how is life everyone? good... thats great... just great... my life ... good and not so good... lets see... summer school=easy... for the most part ive been lazy and ive been reading like crazy... i just finished day after tomorrow and now im reading day of confession... two very good books... so thats all fine and dandy but other parts of my life are fucked up... well first of all... i have been excessively depressed lately which is a combination of things... chemicals... and real life... but that has come and gone and today i feel like myself again... (look to the past entry to see how i feel when im depressed)... so anyways... in other news... other things are fucked up too... mainly... relationships... first of all... i am kind of feeling like a refugee ... im sort of in between friend groups now... the older group doesn't call me... but im kind of distancing myself from the younger group... which is for personal and nonpersonal reasons.... but besides that other relationships seem to be faltering... all i want is to fix things and go back to square one... but i don't know if thats possible now... i hope so ... i really hope so.... ill write more later  -Nate

      tonight.... amazing... absolutely amazing... first of all... things are finally back to normal between cally and i ... not that anything was so so horrible... but it was definitely awkward for a little bit... but that is in the past and forgotten about... so anyways... somehow she convinced her mom to actually let her out of  the house... thank god... i was worried i would not see her before she left for band camp... that would have been devastating... anyways... that was great... it was really nice to see her happy for once too... even if it was a little "influenced"... besides that alanafest was great too....i'm not a huge fan of drinking or drunks for the record... but it is always interesting to see a different facet of friends lives... ex. allison bressi drunk...i knew she did drink... i mean not a lot... but... it was amusing to say the least.... she was singing "from a distance" and trying to force feed me devils food cakes... AH.... wonderful... and the rest of the people there were amusing too... but aside from being amusing i think i really enjoyed myself tonight for these four reasons.  1. cally and i were both happy again 2.no awkwardness finally 3.NO DRAMA !!!!! WAHOO!!! (it was a beautiful thing) 4. I really missed the older group... i have been hanging out with the younger group and i dont fit in with them so well... or know them as well.. except for maybe luke eddie and gucik... but my true colors come out when im with the older group... they are my true friends... and they always seem to brighten my day... no matter what shit is flying at the time... anyways though... it is 2 in the morning... just finally gave up reading the day after tomorrow... not gave up... but just finished for now... im having trouble putting it down... very very good....it started out a little slow... but it is picking up quite nicely... i smell a hitler conspiracy but the way the book is going i could be completely wrong... anyways im out for the night ....have fun ...sleep tight ...and for those of you at alana's be safe! -Nate :)

      well.... folks... there goes happiness... im done with that bullshit.... lets just say that the only thing that could help me right now... is a high near lethal dose of anti depressant... or a run... but seeing as i can't get my hands on the first... and after a fateful dive into the lake ... (aka my knee is now fucked up...) i can't do either.... what a great summer this is turning out to be... and dammit... i actually thought things were turning around... how naive can i be.... well it just goes to show...its true...why have dreams when they are only eventually shattered... its only inevitable and its only my life... and sometimes i wonder if its worth the trouble at all... going to bed with a heavy heart, sore knees, and tired eyes.... - Nate

      so... my life... its pretty decent in general... but these last few days have been very depressing... nothing in particular... or let me rephrase that... i have been very depressed.... i am sort of sick of the world at this point... i mean... the only people i feel like seeing at all are my real close friends (Allison, Luke, Guciks,etc.) and Cally .... i just don't have the patience to put up with people and stuff seems so cardboard cut-out too... like... i've been to about 5 or 6 graduation parties and i feel they are all the same exact party with different "settings"... same bullshit... same boring talk... maybe i just need an adventure or something... something not so well commonplace... as far as cally and i are doing i think everything is going fine... i was feeling a little antisocial yesterday and felt bad because i didn't talk much in general... i was also honestly just wiped out... i think the week of finals just hit me ... anyways... i think cally was cool with it... the parade was fun ... and so was goofing around at my house... except for the whole mom part.. but we'll let that slip...uh eh i mean slide...and we rounded out the day by just sort of lying on the trampoline... all in all it was a very good day... hopefully my depression will let up soon... im planning on finding a job this week... going to summer school... *blech* :0 ... and spending the rest of it with cally before she leaves for camp... anyways...i have to go get a few minutes of yard work done before i go get cleaned up to go to little italy for mcmanu's party... that should be a nice way to end the weekend!... talk to you later... hopefully in a better mood  -Nate

      yeah... finals.. have i studied... eh not really... probably should start... oh wait they are tomorrow... procrastination... well doing things on time... isn't exactly my forte... but whatever... im in an "awwwwww fuck it" kind of mood... you know?.. a rebel without a cause... except that im not really  rebellious... and i have a cause.... sort of... ok scratch that altogether... call me grumpily depressed... depressed cause i haven't gotten a chance to run around the block.... (when i get ancy i get depressed sometimes) and also because im not going to see cally for about four days... big disappointment.... but on the other hand look at the bright side... i have the whole summer to hang out with her... i might see if i can be some help with her studying for american history... then maybe we can get together tomorrow... anyways... i am grumpy too.. just because... well school pisses me off... school in general... but the competetiveness... and all the bullshit SATs and GPA and shit and shit... my life revolves around stupid numbers from 2 to 4 digits long... will it really matter when im 30 what my cumulative gpa was my fourth quarter junior year... or that i squeaked out a 1350 on the SAT... hell no.... so why oh why am i stressing so much about these stupid stupid things... another thing on my mind is the cally situation in general... i know that we are both overthinking things way too much... even though... at least to my knowledge we are both extremely happy with eachother (at least i can say that for sure on my part)... but i think in general we are both worried about getting too involved ... falling too fast... just to be let down... i know that after 17 years... of nonexistent relationships and bland prospects that cally is someone special... people like her don't come by everyday ... that is why i freak out a little bit when i think of the whole situation...when i get a chance like this... well... i just don't want to mess up the great thing we have... so yeah... anyways... i do feel like this.. but deep down... i know.. everything is going to be fine... and everything will work out... if you are reading this cally... just please don't worry... we can take it slow or whatever... but you don't need to worry...thats the last thing i want you to do.. just trust yourself and trust me.. everything is going to be AMAZING... ok... i really must study a little now.... to everyone else... don't stress over finals... its not worth it... no worries!...  -Nate

      okay... its official... we are going out... im extremely excited... so yeah... um... yeah... anyways... we went to harry potter on friday... sweet movie.. different than the first.. but still really good... highlight.. the dementors... so amazingly cool... then we watched... or tried to watch from hell.. we ended up talking for most of it... not a problem though :).... ah... saturday... julie cally and I took the sat... im not going to jinx myself by saying i did sweet or i did bad... for now.. mediocre is a good middle road... i did feel pretty comfortable with it and there were only a few odd math problems here and there... the only thing i had a problem with was the feeling afterwards.. my brain felt like mashed potatoes... just hot steamy and mushy... not much to work with... i was sort of drained for the rest of the day... after we went to panera... oh oh.. then i had to go to travis sutton's graduation... AWKARD!... with a capital A.... yeah... i dont mind... but hes a huge stoner.. and its funny.. i think his parents have no idea... haha... but whatever... that was ok because clay and i only stayed for 15-16ish minutes.. then we went to eddies and played poker/ultimate frisbee... fun night... except... A.elly's thong... (GAG!)... B. it was a little awkward with justin and jt hitting on cally more than i do... im just not like that but i didn't know what to do... yeah... im still confused about that... um.. the rest was fun... i totally sucked at poker... like blew HORRIBLY... i only won one round... yeah.. but it was really fun.. then i took cally home and we sat around the campfire with ashley buchanan... that was great too... ashley is actually a pretty cool person... im glad she doesn't hate me... haha.. long story... but thats about it for last night... im going to go to brunch with the guciks now... talk to you later...  -Nate :)

      yeah ... sat saturday... fun... oh wait no... hopefully ill be able to take it with Cally... at least well be able to laugh about how horrible we did after the fact... tomorrow we are going to go see harry potter and then saturday after SAT i think im going to go to Ashley Buchanan's graduation party with Cally too... it should be fun times... lately i am feeling so comfortable with her and everything seems to be working out... i would have never guessed things would work out like they have.. but i guess i had sort of low expectations for dating and life... well... anyways besides feeling extremely tired still... no thanks to staying up til two o'clock last night... i am feeling the best i have in a long time... not only am i relaxed... not stressed... and feeling generally healthy... (no sniffles or sore throats,etc.) ....  but most importantly ... for the first time... in a very very long time... i think... ok... i know... i am really truly happy again... i owe that to the fact that summer is around the corner and school is ending, but also, and most importantly to one person... anyways... i am good.. hell great.... and i can't wait for things to keep getting better... because... like i said ... things seems to be looking up... and right now... not to be cliche... but i feel like the sky is the limit....  -Nate :)

      well... again... my life... its falling to pieces... my head aches... my body is sore... and everyone is in a bitchy mood... ive been trying to stay positive for so long... that quite frankly im exhausted... exhausted from all the bullshit backstabbing and betrayal... i love having friends who have my back... i also love having friends... oh wait ... i did... i have about three now... but no big deal... at least i can trust them... at least they care about me... but ... for now ill pull that knife out of my back... wipe that spit out of my eye... lace up my shoes... and keep on walkin'... i guess thats all i have left... just the will to move on... i have to ... i have nowhere else to go... so... heres to looking forward ... and while journeying towards that point drowning myself in music, books, school, and extracurriculars... for me... if im doing so much that i can't pay attention to the shit going down... well its worth it... no matter how much stress ... sleep deprivation... or mental exhaustion i go through... becuase... i would rather be exhausted... than remember how shitty everyone can be to me... as they say... ignorance is bliss... and while... yes ignorance is not a final solution... i have one year left... then im gone... i dont have to put up with any of this anymore... and that is a solution... so until then... i will pretend everything is better... i will pretend that my friends are all the same... i will pretend that enjoy life... hell ill even do it with a smile on my face... and outwardly... yeah... i do look positive... that is what i push for... i dont want to be a downer... i dont want to be just like everyone else..."oh my life is so bad" "oh im going to go drink and do pills cause i just cant handle it anymore"... but its hard to be surrounded by that attitude and keep mine up... im not superhuman... im just a normal teenager with fucking normal emotional needs... and no one can see that while i may be smiling on the outside... on the inside its usually not the same case

      god works in mysterious ways.... that is damn true...&nbsp; all i can say is whats done is done... im not going to hash it over more because it is.... over... i feel bad ... i feel happy ... i feel sad.... i feel relieved... to be quite honest i dont even know what to feel... but like ive said many times before... not necessarily on this blog but in person... i think everything happens for a purpose... maybe i was supposed to learn something from this whole fiasco... or maybe something will come from it that i cant even fathom... not everything that happened was bad but not everything was good... all i can say was that it was an experience... i am glad to have had it either way and i am not bitter or grudgeful ... i am just tired and relieved and happy that it ended ... at this point ... the best way possible
