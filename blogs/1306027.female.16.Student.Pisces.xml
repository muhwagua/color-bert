        Sunday Afternoon and Nuthin to do    How terribly tragic, but only half true. I have plenty of things I   could   do, for example: homework, my mosaic, clean my room. Of course there is an alternative today.... ricky just needs to hurry up and get home so we can wash his van. Lol. Hmmm sounds like loads of fun right? Well when we wash a van we do it with music, which makes the whole expierence a lil more enjoyable. Maybe I will cream lorraine with a nice soapy sponge.,.,.,.,.,!     Im Cold.   Maybe if all of my computers were'nt located in the basement I could quite possibly be rid of this problem.    Moving On   It's kinda pretty out today, in that overcast kinda way. The sun peeks out every hour just to let us know that he is in geocentric orbit still. Not to bad a day for a car wash, that is if the Walmart cashiers have'nt taken ricky hostage by now. Who knows? I don't. But I hope he gets back soon cuz i want to throw that sponge at lorraine!

      Ok I decided to write that commentary. Thus begineth the commentary:  The Art of Paper Mosaics By Meghan So-And-So  Ahhhhhh mosaics: these early roman art pieces are something of a mystery. Why? Because I can't seem to conquer them. Granted, using construction paper and elmers glue would take the luster out of most anything. The question is...how the heck are you supposed to place the things correctly? I mean, my designs all right, geometric and all. But the paper just will not work for me. As for the glue, well it wont spread right. It's not my fault I swear! It can't possibly be my fault. Never-the-less I have to finish it soon or it will drive me crazie. (Commentary end)  Well I have gotta go talk to some Anti-War idiots who are 1. Misinformed and 2. just stupid.

      HeyO.  Just got done with my 5 hours mandantory by the state (thank you state). School is such a pain.. but one I guess I can deal with for the time being. So far... Baghdad is NOT winning as the clever Uda hinted towards, in fact some of his republican guards actually want to surrender! HA! TAKE THAT UDA. Unfortunately, this all blows for the iraqis until Mr. Saddam is removed from his dictatorship. I am Pro-war in case you haven't guessed....it had to be done.  Apart from watching Fox News, I have done absolutly nothing. There really is nothing to do but go outside and tan. Maybe I'll do that later... right now I'm Bloggin! I have to admit this thing is pretty cool... Ty stephanie for the hint lol.   So have you heard about the "Strain of mumps, previously thought of as pneumonia."? Yea it's a pretty scary thought.. so far, 13 have died. Could this become a pandemic? W.H.O don't think so. I say don't get your hopes up yet. CDC... my future employer i hope has been investigating "possible" cases of this, "Strain of mumps, previously thought of as pneumonia", apparently popping up all around like popcorn. Worried?! nahhhh. not yet anyways.  You know, I was sitting and thinking about random things during geometry today, a particular subject kept reappearing in my mind. How many licks does it take to get to the center of a blowpop?? Is it less because there is bubblegum and not chocolate? or is there more (licks that is)? Maybe I'll go get one and find out.  Besides my deep thoughts about suckers... i have been thinking about CTD this summer. Im hoping we luck out and dont have a hostile take-over because I'm really looking forward to Topics in Bio. The teacher sounds pretty cool... and the assignments dont look too bad... Im sure it will all be easier with my GIANT fan and my COLD mini fridge. But im probably most looking forward to Chicago itself. That city is the most awesome place ever, if I could I would stay there. I heard boston is pretty tight to, but we will see.  Random Quote of the day: When their missles out number yours, it might be a good idea to DUCK.

      Did ya'll like my little rant down there?? Ya, I get worked up sometimes. But who wouldn't?   Moving on:  2 more days!!! BWAHA! I cannot wait, i'm so siked. Just the thought of 3 weeks in a dorm with people like stephanie (hahahaha) gets me on a happy streak again. Plus- im decked out this year. Im'a have people thinking im rich- hahahahaha. No really tho- Im middle middle class. To quote a song "Ya'll just dont know what its like, to be female, middle class, and white." actually the song had 'male' but that would sound a bit strange as a comparison ya know?  Today comes more  packing . Joy. I can't say that I enjoy packing but hey, I'm leavin in 2 days so what does it matter?  Speaking of packing- i think I'll go do some.

       Yeah, yeah I know, commitment issues.    But can it be helped? I doubt it. I'm just too busy with my life I guess. I can't help but wonder what my life would have been like if I had kept my membership to the general public... and then I shudder. I like being me, most of the time anyway. But then again, who knows who I am? I dont' even know anymore. Maybe that's part of growing up. Or maybe the temperature of the room is affecting my higher thinking abilities. Either way, I feel like I'm missing something. I don't really connect with people, and when I do, it's only people who have equal or higher thinking capabilities. I mean, should I connect with some bimbo and start giggling in audaciously high tones to keep a certain status quo?  People don't understand me . I like being me. I want to be me. I don't have to go to a public school to become  somebody.  They think that I'm so anti-social and I'm not. I have personal preferences, just like they do. What's the frikin deal? Please, I want everyone just to grow up. Your friends don't make you . Just for once pretend that your life isn't about them. Don't ask for their opinion, don't take their advice.  Be yourself . But then again, who are you? If you've let your friends dictate your life this whole time, how are you supposed to find yourself? When it really comes down to the line, you'll find that your exactly the opposite of what you could be.  Some people say that your friends make you. That makes it sound like your so co-dependant, that you have to have friends that make who you are.  No.  No one makes anyone, it's all foma(lies). But there are on occasion, people who will affect your life, and for those people you can be truly grateful or ungrateful too. I do not understand what the problem is. Why? The eternal question of mine that will never be answered. Think what you will of me,  I dont care anyway . I have a life to live, and I intend on living it to my, yes my, fullest potential. Does this mean that I have no friends and I sit in my room all day? No, I have friends. I enjoy having friends. But my friends don't make me. Don't get me wrong,  I love my friends . Its the people who don't know me, and think that they do, that really set me off.  Sure, everyone has certain feelings about my homeschooling, but that doesnt mean they have to share them with me. When they ask if I want to go back, I always say no. Why dont I want to go back? For the same reasons that you stay.  Its John Galt syndrome  why give in when I have so much potential? Granted, I know that High School for alot of people is a "learning expierence" and they will never forget the memories from there. And I realize that alot of people can maintain an identity of sorts through High School. These people are inspiring. But just because I chose not to have to fight to keep that in a public school does not mean that I am a weird and anti-social person. I am doing this for  myself , no one else will benefit. Is that selfish? No. I am me and I fight for that which can't be seen.  Identity.    You might think that this blog entry was a total waste seeing as no one is likely to ever read it. But then again I'm not writing this so you can read it. I'm writing this to confirm in me what I have always feared.  Myself.

       Hey look! It's monday and I'm still alive.   This means I have made it through another grueling week of waiting. Waiting for what? For camp duh. Camp? Ya. A three week long camp. *Joy* It's an academic camp but what do I care? Im academic. It's awesome in my very own special opinion. Chicago is the most awesomest city ever. Yes, that concludes my uses of "awesome".   What put my mind on camp? Well, shopping for supplies could do it. My paycheck was ultimately blown to pieces by the following purchases: An alarm, an answering machine, some makeup, batteries, a phone jack splitter, film, power strips, and several other misc. items. I will be well prepared... hahahaha. I will make others green with envy, or red. What does it matter? It will be envy. Lol.

      It's the adventures of...*thematic music*.... GIRL IN UNIFORM   Tonight's Episode:    Mind over cup dispenser.   Yes, cup dispensers can be a bit of trouble for one sleep deprived person such as myself. There is a typical order in which things must been done to battle a cup dispenser.   1. Get the cups.  2. Slip on the wet floor.. but gracefully catch yourself mid fall.  3. Reach the ominous looking cup dispenser.  4. Lay cups down and grab the order for drive-thru.  5. Return to the cups only to be interrupted by another customer at drive thru.  6. Unwrap the cups from the plastic they were packaged in.  7. *Ding* "Go ahead with your order" (its not like I was busy anyways). 8. Try and hold back the plastic things while at the same time trying to shove a 3 foot column of cups into the dispenser. 9. Fix the bends in the cups from not succeeding the first time. 10. Breathe in and Out, try again.  11. *DING* "I would like an ice cream thing." "Maam, that is served at the restaurant around the building." 12. You get the cups in the cup dispenser and all is well.  13. You find out there is no lids.  And so the saga continues until you are fortunate enough to clock out. Which so happens to be another 5 hours and 45 minutes away. Good Luck.

         And if you pick up the phone right now....  Hey look! I am still up.. thats a frikin miracle. I have become a walking zombie since I started working. I sleep during the day, and blog in the night hours. Special... I know. You would'nt believe the massive amount of lame infomercials are on this late at night... its making me gag (x 2). I once wrote an article about informercials. Maybe I'll post it one of these days. O and as for Bucky, don't worry he'll be back by tomorrow. I promise.

       I know you were looking forward to reading more about Bucky, but today I'm feeling a lack of creativity. Let me explain why:   New Threat: Saturday the 14th  No, I can't have bad luck on Friday the 13th, I have to have bad luck on Saturday the 14th, which in case you didn't glance at your calendar, is today. Work is such a pain, and so it should be when your working for a fast food coffee place. Lets see I....    1. Spilled coffee everywhere  2. Broke a cup  3. Got scolded and  4. Got nasty, nasty looks from customers of all ages.   Your thinking, "Regular day, right?". What is regular?? I am new, I haven't been trained to recognize "regular". *sigh* O well, I'm sure it'll get better. Just in time for camp (I hope I hope). I don't need to be starting camp with a chip or 5 on my shoulder. *cough* ok, new subject.  Have you seen that commercial about the trunk monkey. Dude, I want a trunk monkey.   Quote of the day. "From the moment I wake up, I reach for my smiley face cup..... and pour coffee enough for 2.... forever and ever and ever we'll be."

       I like to call this,  Bucky's Story .   Once upon an oak tree there was a young squirrel with malformed teeth named Bucky. Bucky was not an ordinary squirrel, he had the misfortune of being raised by a pack of wild pigeons. However, Bucky has overcome his obvious pratfalls by learning to be a messenger squirrel. Bucky currently works for the Pigeon Express earning menial wages. (I wrote this one..)  Bucky's life long dream was to become a New York pigeon. Ever since the beginnings of the Pigeon Express he tried but always failed to be a pigeon. One day Bucky ran into the oldest, wisest, and most trusted (*drum roll*) grasshopper, Kanga Roo Jack. Now Kanga had the best plan for Bucky-- Since Bucky was always in trouble and was often called a klutz Mr. Roo told Bucky to travel to the other side of the moon and recollect all memories of lost treasure recovering green bean casserole. One thing about Kanga Roo Jack-- he has little memory and makes no sense when he talks. But that doesn't stop Bucky from traveling to the other side of the moon and recollect all memories of lost treasure recovering green bean casserole. (  urlLink Carmen  wrote this)   We meet Bucky later at the Salty Spitoon having a little fun before he embarks on his trip. The Salty Spitoon is well known for the house drink, nair. Now, you may be thinking, "Nair??". Yes, Nair. It has been proven that nair, in shot glass amounts has the same affect as alcohol does. The only extra side effect is massive hair loss. This may be the reason why Bucky is experiencing squirrel pattern baldness at such a young age. This may be an advantage for Bucky, seeing as the best-looking pigeons are the hairless ones. (>Yep I wrote this)   Bucky notices his hair loss and at first is in extreme drunken shock, but after a while (although he loved his fur very much) he decided if he was ever gonna be a New York pigeon, he was gonna have to be bald. Taking Kanga's offer he goes to the Moon and notices that well there's no gravity. The now Bouncy Bald Bucky floats around looking for the casserole and after plenty of looking his space ship runs out of gas. After realizing he only has enough food for 2 weeks and no gas reserves or phone, he gives up his dream of being a New...York...Pigeon. WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN, A METEORITE starts going straight towards the earth! Bouncy bald bucky gets an insane idea to jump on and make it back to earth. He crash lands in Africa where the native pigeons confuse him for their King. (this was by urlLink  Josh )  Because of the extreme impact of the spaceship to the ground, Bucky is experiencing a slight case of amnesia. In a last-stitch effort to regain all remembrance of his past, Bucky goes to visit the local knowledge Pigeon, who is really a slightly confused sparrow. "O Knowledge Pigeon, tell me who I am," pleads our buck-toothed friend. The Knowledge pigeon, who is really Sir Sparrow, tells bucky that he is the great one who fell from the sky. "I fell from the sky?" asks Bucky. "Yes," replies the Knowledge Pigeon. Although the Knowledge Pigeon isn't really a pigeon, he still knows everything there is to know, and Bucky realizing this fact, asks Sir Sparrow to become his mentor. Sir Sparrow accepts Bucky's invitation because of his secret desire to be just like Mr. Miyagi in the Karate Kid movies. (Yep, another beautiful paragraph by, me.)  Sir Sparrow and Bucky begin training right away.  Mrs. Sparrow, Sir Sparrow's mommy, and also a chef, serves them everyday after training.  And everyday its always this dish, best described as stuff.  After a few weeks of training Bucky begins to wonder what exactly it is he's eating so he asks.  Mrs. Sparrow informs him that it's a recipe that's been in the family for years, back from when her great-great-great-great-grand-sparrow used to live on the moon.  "I call it green bean casserole".  Bucky can't believe his luck..  Bucky's Lucky!! The next day during his training he can hardly concentrate "I could get Mrs. Sparrow to make some of this stuff and I could take it back to Mr.Roo. He's ancient and he cant remember much anyway, the old kook wont be able to tell the difference.  Besides, its a genuine recipe, it came from moon-inhabitants."  are the thoughts that fill his mind. ( urlLink Becca  wrote this part)  (this is bucky- feel free to add to his tales)

       Word of the day: Pain.   The dance recital went very well. I only messed up once -I swear it. It was like a rush of spandex and feathers and tights. There were people all ages running around the dressing areas and stretching and practicing in the halls. It brought me back to my younger days at church singing things, without the spandex naturally. By the curtain call I was was convinced that I had an awesome time. So maybe it wasn't that bad after all. Well, except for the fact that crissy's little sister chucked on my new shirt....  But back to the pain- Standing around for 3 1/2 hours one night and then standing for 4 the next day can tend to cause major muscle spasms (Insert picture of a leg shaking very violently). Rest? Forget it- I have a life. I will probably just keep going until I am A. Forced to sleep, or B. Become Narcoleptic(spelled by fonix,ha). Right now B looks like he better choice.

       Saying of the day: Work sucks.   I clocked 5 hours today.. I know, amazing right? Most shifts are 8 hours but since I'm a minor the state figures that I don't need as much money. Do they know how much the tuition for Harvard summer school is!? O ya... and there's the car insurance and I need a kick-bootay camera for photography class. GrRrRrRrRrRrRr. But I'm not dissin the state- I mean they have to make rules... that's their job right? Whatever.   All this is not why work sucks though, work sucks because well, people suck. Not all people, just some people. More specifically: Fresh Lady. I know people like things to be fresh, but this goes beyond being a pain in the buttox. First Offence: asks to taste the chicken and tuna salad.. tells me that they both are horribly disgusting and demands I get a "fresh spoon". Second Offence: Gets nasty with Amy after asking which bread (white or wheat) was fresher. Third Offence: Yells at ash for not making the sandwich to her exact standards. Is Ashley frikin clairvoyant?? NO.. that lady needs to make her own sandwiches. Next time she'll prolly say the ham isn't sliced thin enough. Jeeze.  Apart from work sucking.. I have a dance recital tonight (enter the blue sparkly spandex costume). I just hope I don't trip or do something incredibly stupid or embarrassing. Ha.. to late. Eminent Doom Looms... I may write after the recital to recall events.   Exact countdown: 2 hours 49 minz. O gee can't wait.

       Crap   This recital is going to be a disaster... probably because I cannot dance. Period. End of discussion. ARG. *Tear* O well, at least I have something to look forward to next year.. art classes! My true talent. Granted I might not be able to draw, but I do pretty well with mosaics and such.. haha just the things I thought I would hate. I would really like to take photography. Yea.  Dude, I'm hungry. Cheese crackers are calling. Apple juice is.... uh.... summoning? Right. Well you try n make a mental picture out of that one.. I'm off to eat.

       Ok, so I have commitment issues. I won't deny it.   Writing in a Journal every day shouldn't be so hard... I guess that I just haven't caught blog fever yet. Another reason for the absence of entrys could be the fact that I had an Essay and a research paper due by the end of school. The Essay was aight, got it done in 3 days. The research paper.. well.. lets just say the U.N. isn't as fascinating as people make it out to be. Insulting? Yes, but what good would a research paper be if you didn't insult just a little(Ok, a lot in my case).   Well school is out now, which is good. That means I can work extra hard at my spiffy new summer job ( Insert gagging sound here). I work at a coffee shop sorta place which means I deal with all types. Morning people, afternoon people, and generally weird people are my everyday frequents, some nice, some rude, some extremely rude, some totally awesome, some not so totally awesome, and some very annoying. *Takes breath* All-in-all though, it's not too bad of a job. I need the cash so you could say I don't complain too much. Hey! Shutup! I am not that bad. :-P  I am looking forward to my supa fly summer camp at Northwestern Uni.(Hahahahaha),starting at the end of June. Three whole weeks from the parentals and the city I live in...YA.. bring it on. I'm equipped 2 the T this year and I have saved up major loads of cash(Shopping, here I come). My class: Topics in Bio. Sounds like a blast. I love biology and I want to be a geneticist or a epidemiologist or... a virologist.. ya big words I know. I'll prolly end up going to college at Havard or Uni. of Chicago. I love Boston and I love Chicago, so either one would be awesome.  Back to the present. I have a dance recital in 4 days... lovely. Just how I wanted to spend my weekend. Grrrr. The costumes are pretty cute.... uh for blue sparkly spandex that is. Have you noticed how Disney seems to have a monopoly on everything this year? First about a million proms have it as a theme and then my dance studio had to go and pick "A tribute to Disney" as the recital theme. Coincidence? Hardly. I don't know about you, but I particularly do not enjoy dancing to a rendition of beauty and the beast by the group Jump5. (Tip: I cannot spell so do not take offense to the obvious errors.) That's it, I'm taking art classes next school year.

       IM BACK!   You know it.... and yes, I am accepting lunch date invites.  BWAH . No way, lets go catch a movie instead.   Ahhhhh Camp:  It's all about the good times, and man did I have them. Some of my fondest memories would be.....   1. Holding my breath while passing a graveyard(taking cheat breaths all the way). 2. Riding in a charter bus for the first time.  3. Disecting a rat and seeing jessica turn a morbid shade of green.  4. Outwardly dissing gus and arvin.                                          5. Giving sachin his TA present. 6. Working my butt off and getting an A- in my class. 7. Throwing food at various unnamed people. 8. Complaining about the food. 9. Complaining about EVERYTHING. 10. Hanging with the hall mates.   There's a lot more that I could list... but right now I'll leave it at that.    That is the end of my blog writing. What a total waste of time, right?

       So, today was my last day of work  And it couldn’t have possibly been worse. I mean, when you ask someone nicely to do something, aren't they even the least obligated to do it, especially if they are getting paid for doing that thing or some thing(s) that you have asked them to do?!?! I mean, ok so new people are a tad clueless, I know I was as a new person- but at least I was willing to learn how to do something. And then do it.  I guess I can't complain anymore- I don't work there! AHAHA- Freedom. My summer job is officially over, this is the official documentation proof I do know that I'll be missed.... I was just starting to reach my experienced employee stance.    Enough with the bragging  So I finally got finished redecorating my room,  Almost . It is so(o x 100) awesome!I mean- For a middle class white girl's room it is pretty sweet. I better describe it before you die of curiosity.   Once you walk through the door the the first thing you'll see is  The Movie/Music wall- Posters galore. Here you will see some movie and music posters on a corner like section of the wall.   And to the side we have  The reading spot- Over here we have a black mosquito net hanging down from the ceiling... cool, I know. And inside the net we have a papasan chair (o la la) so comfortable and such, I fell asleep in it last night. Also, On the wall inside the mosquito net there is a display of my art and a Barnes n nobles bag with a buncha classic books on it. It also has this name plaque thingy that says my name and why I'm so great...lol. There are also some bamboo porch lights hanging from the ceiling providing some much needed light.   Moving on  Once you walk away from the magnificent chair(if you have the will power to get your butt up that is), you will see my little tribute to Zen corner. Over here we have a cherry wood dresser with stick-like handles, a bamboo lamp, a Zen garden with a masterful design, and a plaque with a Chinese character representing tranquility.    Now if you'll please look up and to the right   You'll see my kimono poster (fetish i acquired from my Aunt, who happened to live in Japan for 2 years) with Japanese character plaques on either side... one says faith, and the other says ambition. Hanging from the wall over here is this nifty little Origami thing I bought at my hometowns yearly festival.    Take a U-turn(driver's ed speak)   Now your facing the bed, newly complete with a spiffy dragon bedspread(Black N White). On the headboard resides a new stereo system- It changes color as the music plays- isn’t that awesome?!   Lastly- You'll see  The black curtains that allow me to sleep during the day.    And with that my room is done...almost.   Tomorrow is the first day of my sophomore life  And to think, I have to travel all the way to my kitchen to start it. The line up this year seems weak in comparison to last year's line up. Physics, AP American History, Algebra II, Honors English, and Advanced Lit. Ok, so maybe this year isn't going to be so  easy .  But hey- gotta get that expierence if I'm gonna get into an Ivy League or it's equivalent. Don't read this and think- O it's another brain child who spontanously generates A's and goes through life being worshipped and will make a booku amount of bucks. No  I work very hard and not enough people seem to respect that. I'm not stuck up and I don't flaunt my accomplishments here and there and everywhere. *sigh* Some people don't understand.   I’m tired and I have some more reading to do- The Fountain Head. I suggest you read it... that book rocks my socks.

       Ok, so it's been ten days since my last post.  What can I say? Im a busy person. Also- my whole week has been kind of a mess.   First on my list of complaints  Work. They have yet to develop a respect for me. I've given them alot to respect! I show up on time and on the days that I am sceduled. I don't understand why I have to subsitute work for someone who doesnt do their job- Why can't they just schedule me more hours? I have no problem showing up when im scheduled- I just don't appreciate it when i get a call at 7 in the morning with a voice on the line saying.." We  need  you to come in and work". Not to mention I usually have stuff scheduled when they do it. But, their are some cool people that I work with...very few, but still cool, that I actually enjoy working with.    Second on my list of complaints  Power outages.... yea, why do transformers have to go bad and leave me and my brother without electricity for an hour?! I can barely keep my brother entertained as it is with electricity, But today I had to recall every card game I had ever learned just to keep him, as well as myself, from going crazy. After we had finally exhausted every card game known to any card book, we finally dragged out the chess board. After about 3 moves, and my imminent doom near (after three moves? yes it's possible, mind you I have had no sleep...) a miraculous thing happened (my spelling improved? Nope, sorry not this time.) The power came back on! To celebrate our great joy my brother and I jumped up in excitment and reset all of the clocks.... *cough cough, I hate power outages*   Lastly on my list of complaints  Why do people have to be so...so...self-loving? Everytime I say something to this un-named person, they look at me as if i'm stupid, or losing my mind. This "person" is only a year older than me... how can she possibly justify being superior to me because of their age? Also- my academic achievements... squat, just because she goes to a nice public high school and takes all of the higher level courses doesnt mean that she's better than me. If only I could be unprofessional for a day I would give her the low-down on what's eventually going to happen to her if she keeps up the nasty little attitude towards certain people. That's right- She'd be shocked right out of her freaking socks if I actually opened my mouth and give her a little taste of reality, I am a person, I do feel, and despite the fact I don't talk at work.... I do talk and people usually don't like what I have to say. I wonder why.   Ok so I'm done complaining on the most part  How bout I tell you about my day. Other than the power outage it was somewhat uneventful. Except! *thematic music* I had a near-tragic event that occurred while i was making dinner. Lets review- No sleep, work, and power outage- I lied, my day was eventful. It was a bad day, I will admit it. When this event happened I was residing somewhere in my right brain, i seriously dont know what I was thinking when I did it- I mean subconsciously, I knew what would happen, but I couldnt react fast enough... still wanna know what happened? (the suspense must be killing you..) I pulled out the pork chops... smellin yummy and looking tasty, I remove them from the glass container. I think- hey! I'll get the dishes done before my dad gets home. So, I put the glass dish in the sink and unknowingly reach for the cold water faucet turner-on-er... BIG mistake. For those of you who don't know what happens when you pour cold water on hot glass, look in a chemistry book cause i don't have time to explain the process. But to make a long story short, the glass container EXPLODED... good thing I had quickly exited my right brain at that time and jumped back- or I could have had glass embedded in my arm. I called my mother and said "You have to promise not to get mad, just know that brother, the dog, or myself were not harmed." I'm good aren't I? My mom said- It's ok, I've done many a stupid thing in my life...just consider this a learning expierence. I did as I carefully scooped up the 3,000 glass shards that the glass container was know reduced to. TIP: When cleaning up glass shards- its a good idea to protect your hands with thick rubber gloves and make sure that the glass is thrown into a triple bagged bag.  Ok, so that's it. BTW- I will be updating my pics sometime tonight. Im also think of adding a song of the week too.... hm hm... I dunno.

       It's that time again- yes, time for a post!!  Well, it's also that time again for alot of things. That time again for school, fall redecorating and cleaning, and working. All-in-All my summer ranked pretty well. The three weeks I spent in chicago definately helped though, like a mini-vaca, only with actual work involved. I made alot of new friends... Ellen, Ritu, Risha, Anu, Anna, Faye, Nicole, Joe, Margaret, Janna, Alaska (friend??....i dunno, he's weird.), Big rishie, and I also repatched some old friendships- Arturo, Sarah so on and so on. The expierence was great! But I don't think I could maintain my sanity having to school with all those kids again. I got alot of good ideas from them and vice-versa but you know... I like learning by myself. Some people think that's weird. I really don't care.  On to lighter and care free(er) things.  I'm redoing my room!   Yes, yes I know... it's been a long time coming. I don't think I could have lived with my "Sun and Moon" comforter much longer. No, Im taking a much more cooler stance on my room... seeing as my mom says it's the last decorating im allowed to do until I leave for college. (3 years). What are my plans? Well- Itz a black and tan motif. I got this really funked up bedding stuff with chinese symbols all over it. Next step- out with my curio cabinent. *Yes, I admit* I have a curio cabinent full of *cringe* Ty beanie babies from my younger years as an aggressive collector. Im selling that and my keyboard- mainly because I just can't stand the sight of either in my room any longer. What's coming in place? Well- being the avid Ayn Rand fan that I am- I have decided to set up a reading and writing space(clever, no?) It's gonna have one of those posh moon chairs and a night stand with a bamboo lamp. This part of my room will also showcase my art, a mosaic and an illumination. There would be several other art examples of mine only, my art teacher stole them...she did! *insert sounds of random mumblings*   Speaking of random mumblings...  I tend to be scaring people at work with my mumbling. Im told that I should not discuss my plans with myself. In my defence I utter- But that's part of the plan! And go back to my work, which would be doing things that people usually wont do on their shift at my workplace... like.. o i dunno... do their job. Don't get me wrong- there are some awesome people where I work.... but others... well, i wont go there.    Enough with the complaining!  I went shopping today!!!!  WOOHOO  If you know me than you know that I have several love's.... one of them being shopping. Here's a list of what i bought today.  1. Mini posters. I once knew sanity- but it managed to escape And Out of all the things I've lost, I miss my mind the most. 2. 2 pairs of jeans. It's that school type of season again. One dark and one sand blasted pair. 3. A new pair of boots!!! I LOVE EM.. they are so cute. 4. A cute shirt.  I should really go do some laundry.

I can't wait any longer- and it's 3 days away! Meh... I guess not all is lost. All is not lost because I have moo-moo. No, I'm not weird. Moo-moo is my serta counting sheep and your jealous cause you don't have one (a serta counting sheep that is..) :-P.  Right, as you can prolly tell I'm just a little sleep deprived.

      There is a reason why, naturally. If you were predicting a rather long explanation than you were correct...    It all started with the weekend     -Saturday  A relatively agitating day. My dad had the weekend off because of his business-sponsored trip to Texas beginng on Monday. My whole family got up and got ready to leave for Walmart and OldNavy. But what actually happened, was my brother, who's birthday was near, felt it was time to receive his birthday present at that moment and preceded to drag us all over town trying to find an Xbox steering wheel. By the time we reached OldNavy, all of us were on our last nerve. I wanted to go driving(Hello- 50 hour slip..) and my brother was whining because he had a new Xbox steering wheel that he had to try out within the next 20 mins or he would just die. My father didn't feel like being out at all and wanted to be drove home too. The day ended ok though, I got to drive and Dad and Alex got to go home. Mom finished it off by taking us to see a movie about alien space dogs(Good Boy).    -Sunday  Went to church, went to B&N, studied for the psats. It was a relatively uneventful day. Ended it by watching alias.    -Monday  Monday was a really hard day for me. It started semi-early in the morning. My family all jumped in the van and wisted off towards the airport. For those of you who don't know, my dad has never been away.. like ever. The whole time we were waiting I was choking back waterfalls. When the time finally came to say goodbye, I lost it and cried the whole way home. I don't know what I was really emotional about- maybe it was just that I had a lot to deal with in the coming week and it would have been better to have him home. My mom sensed my distraught and stayed home. I had the psats on Tuesday, and I was panicking big time. My mom bought dinner and studied with to the point where I thought my brain would crack. I went to bed at 1:30 with red eyes and an unsure feeling.   -Tuesday  I can't say that I really "woke up" cause I really didn't sleep. My mom bought me breakfast and sharpened my pencils. We left the house relatively early and got there early. We traveled to several rooms inquiring about the psats and were directed to the wrong room- then to another wrong room, and then to the right room. I sat with my pencils and my calculator waiting for the test. And then it was over. Done. Just like that. Scores will be back in December.    -The rest of the week  A blur, It really didn't matter. My dad came back Friday. And that's it. Kinda boring huh?

      That was me experimenting with my little known chemistry and my physics book. MUAHA- I hate physics.    But other than that  It's goin good. I got to do my first real driving yesterday- without crashing the car. WOOHOO~!. Im so proud. My father, however, was left with more than one white hair after that ordeal. You see- I tend to drift to the center while making my turns, and I tend to take them fast(well if you call 15mph fast...). It was an almost abandoned parking lot near a taco bell. My father was definately sweatin it though- he acted like I was going to careen into a curb going 50.    Driving is fun, learning about it isn't.  The classes I have to take are 3 hours long! Plus- the driving school isn't all that nice either. Were talking- metal folding chairs. Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is to sit in a metal folding chair for three hours?! I didn't until I started drivers ed. I also didn't know people get impalled by guard rails almost everyday.    Last night's class was especially unbearable.  Why? Because of the morons in the back of the class chanting my name. I ignored them- which seemed to edge them on to further chanting. What was the deal??"The world is populated by multiples of stupid people" I told myself. I then began having daydreams of groups of half-witted idiots running into parked cars and I felt much better.  So- Im bored.  It's friday and I have absolutely nothing to do. Maybe I will blog several times today... who knows?!

      One word, learners permit test. Now, you may be thinking, "O that's easy". Well- it's not. The state that I live in just so happens to have one of the hardest driving tests known to man(besides IOWA, their driving test could be considered in some states as a form of chinese torture.). Questions were asked that someone of uber genius couldn't even answer. I was shaking in my boots(which were actually shoes) by the time we hit the door and my stomach was tick-tack-throw up.    It was an overcasted day...  suggesting emminent doom. I was ready. They lady behind the desk called our number and my mother and I were up in a flash. "Got your packet?", she says. "Yes- we have the package.. I mean, the packet.", I reply. The lady behind the desk points, and we're off to the testing center. I'm asked a serious of questions like, "Do you have a drivers license in any other state" and, " Do you have any outstanding tickets that you can be taken to court over." After these questions came the vision test, where the text applicator found out that I, Meghan, could not distinguish my left from my right. "I'm a little nervous" I told her. "It shows", she replyed. I was then directed towards a big computer that had the number 1 scrolling this way and that. The test pops up and I am feeling less than confident. By the 5th missed question it was apparent to me that I WASN'T READY! I begin to daydream that I'm drowning in traffic signs and DUI charges. I begin to take proactionary measurements, skip the hard ones to leave until later. With this method I sucessfully passed with a 78%. Thats a percent above lowest passing grade.    Gulp  That was more than riveting. But now its over, and all I can do is retell my story in this lovely blog.

      Why, do guys have to keep things to themselves? Why can't they say, "Something is wrong, I need somone to talk too". I would have listened! I promise I would have- why could'nt he just say something? But then again, I knew something was wrong.    He showed up at my door...  With a backpack and a "Hi". My first thought was he was there to see my dad- They usually talk about computers and stuff. But my dad was sick, he didn't want visitors. I'm so stupid! I wanted to ask what was wrong and I didn't.... and now I'm worried about him. His dad came looking for him a bit later- said he and his mom had a fight.     Omg, I'm such a horrible person  I could have helped him- said "Whats wrong?" But I didn't and now he probably hates me. He walked like 5 miles to our house!! WALKED. I'm a terrible terrible terrible person.     He's home now  But I'm still worried about how he's feeling. His mom must have made him pretty mad to make him walk all the way to our house. I still can't believe I let him leave.      :'-( I'm so sorry

      Erm, and I didn't have the greatest time. There was a cascading series of events that just so happened to fall into place while I was on vacation this year. The expierence was like an ominous cloud that sat over top of my head chanting, "I'm gonna drown you, I'm gonna drown you!" I may sound like I'm exaggerating- But your not from *insert city and state here.* This city just so happens to be caught in a continuous time warp bubble thing while the whole outside world is poking it with it's advancement needles. Meh, so I had a bad time, do you want to hear about it?     Well your going to anyway  You know how most tragic stories have a underlying event that seems to lead in the cascading of all events? Well, on the second day of my arrival at *insert city and state here*(Notice how I skip straight to the second day- this may be because on the first day we had just arrived at 6pm with a false hope that we might have a nice vacation.) we are sitting in my grandparents house discussing what my grandfather had learned from a set of Creation Science tapes when my grandmother recieves a call. Actually it was three calls- you know how bad things come in threes? Well this was one of those times. On the third call my grandmother's face twisted into a vortex of bad tidings as she screamed, "WHAT, WHAT, KEN, TREE??" I shouted for silence and the tv and computer went off. As we sat there thinking, "Who is possibly so deaf that grandma has to shout?" my grandma got off the phone. "Kenneth got hit by a tree," my grandma said. "A Tree?? How the heck did he get hit by a tree?" was the unanimous thought traveling through every family members mind but alexs (his mind was in the computer game). I sprint for the cheeseball and the crakers and we make for the hospital. While on the way, we call my aunt who calls my cousin who calls someone else and they all agree to meet at the hospital. Everyone is there and we are all waiting for my uncle to arrive on the stretcher. My great uncle's wife and daughter arrive in an array of nerves and tears. "They think he's broke his back," my great aunt says choking at the own realization of her words. Finally he arrives and they dont think he's broke his back. The long process ahead were the xrays which took about 2 1/2 hours to complete. "He's gonna ok, they know now that he only broke his leg", says someone. Alex is getting really anxious now- we've been sitting here for 3 hours. I decide on affirmitive action and take him to get something to eat. Soon, we left the hospital and headed to the hotel for some rest which we did not get.     Wow, that sucks.  Yeah it did. And the octoberfest sucked too. The prices were high and the bee's were attacking like the Bats in  Bats  So all in all, my vacation sucked. And that is the end of my complaining today.

      I know I've brought you to tears my 2 loyal fans. But fear not, because I, Meghan, am now posting.    First order of the post  It's my friend Arturo's bday today! Woohoo! Here's to being 15.... Ya so anyway- Happy Birthday! He'll prolly never read this but in the unlikely case that he does it's here. I sent a present, and then a surprise present.. and I haven't heard from him, so I'm like...wondering if he fell of the face of the planet or is just really busy. Hopefully it's the second one.   Second order of the post  Updates. Which would be few because well, just because. I went to driving class last night and it was boring. The guy teaching it was talking at about 100 mph and I can only write about half that fast. So my notes had an amazing resemblance to this: Park curb, 10 inches, Change Flat Lugnuts, Drive. So I have impartial notes which is not ok. I think my butt was numb the rest of the night. I went driving again today! I did pretty well this time, my dad only gripped the passenger side handlebar twice. I like driving now- I drive about an hour at a time on country roads. The only time I had trouble was when there was a garbage can in the road.    Third Order of the post  Well I'm not sure what to do with this part. Lol. Well ya, Um... *HUTTAH* So, I was like *BAM* and then *HOIGHT* and suddenly I was here posting. *Yawn* I'm tired. Very tired. So I'm gonna go sleep.   I'm out like a turkey on thanksgiving day. HUTTAH

      So I haven't posted, what else is new? I do, however, have a funny story to tell this time. It should save me from the mass stoning I could have quite possibly received from my 2 loyal fans (I love you guys. *eyes get moist*).   Stay on the road you nut!  You see, I have the slight tendency to stray from the middle of the road. The story is set in my general area. It's more like a series of stories, but you know if I didn't have to explain that I could actually tell the story.   Practice makes perfect-right?  Wrong. I'm terrible, I admit it. Driving is a totally new experience to me. It also happens to be a totally hilarious experience too. Observe:   The Vacant Parking Lot  The beginning of my training occurred in a vacant parking lot. There wasn't anything really funny about this part, except for the turns- I have the tendency to take turns a little speedily. I was going maybe, 15mph, and my dad acted like I was taking it at 50mph. Haha- dad's gotten more then one gray hair out of this experience.   "Graduation"  "What? ARE YOU CRAZY", yells my little brother affectionately from the back seat. My dad decides to set me loose on a back road. "Just close your eyes-you'll be fine" my brother tells himself in the back seat. I am forced to drive 30mph. That's really fast when you haven't drove that fast before. I do ok. Except for that turn into the neighborhood. TIP: You can't take a 90 degree turn into a residential area going 35. It doesn't work out very well. "Are we alive?" "Alex, shutup." We make it home fine from there. But then there was *HUTTAH* Part two. *You hear what sounds like thematic elevator music.* My mom takes me out driving Sunday. I say- hey let me take over for the rest of the way. I put the fear of God into my mother that night. When I looked over, she was turning a ghostly shade of white and looking a bit nauseous. She was hanging on to the handlebar like a senior citizen yearns for a bedpan.   "Meghan, the speed limit is 50, you can't drive 30. People are starting to line up behind us."  So I drive like a granny. I can't help it! I value my life to much, got stuff to do you know? Yesterday was my first roasd trip. Rural road trip that is. We drove out to an obscure little town and back. I'm getting better, I even drove the speed limit on the way back! It's hard to stay in the middle of the road though when you drive a big huge van. I was slightly sticking to the shoulder to much and my dad had to say "Stay in the middle, Meghan", about every 30 seconds or so. We stopped at a gas station to get a sandwich, and my dad told me I was doing good. "You can tell me the truth you know" he just laughs. "I'm serious" he says. On the way home he tells me about his teenage driving experience. We made it home in one piece. Not to mention we racked up an hour of driving while we were out.    So.  My brother asked to be excluded from all further driving lessons, lol. I guess he values his life to much too. hehe. My mother is a little resistant to take me driving again, after all- she grays faster than my dad. Me? Driving is all right, I just can't wait to drive something smaller. I'll be ok when I drive something much smaller.

       Wait- what's this... a post?! *falls over, artificially dead*  You know it! I'm back bloggin on this one cause its the one becca has a link too. Let's see.... I'd rather not catch you up because, well, that would take forever. I could go on and on about my commitment issues, but that could get really boring, really quickly. So what was the whole point off this post? Well I can tell you that- the purpose of this post it to tell you that I'm back blogging and I have some stories to tell. I also have a trusty sidekick this time... Mista Jiggyfly my barnes and nobles teddy. Why the name? Have you seen that geico commercial where the white dude is rapping and he's like "Don't use bad words this ain't no puppet shoew, Always use good manners when ya eatin a sloppy joahhheee, Go ohn and ohn and ohn and ohn, PEACE". *ahem, the misspelling is due to his white boy rapping accent* Well I was so moved by the commercial, that I named my bear Mista Jiggyfly. That's better than naming him Trunk Monkey so stop laughing!     Since when did soul jam appear on Dick Clark's Rocking New Years Eve?  I don't understand it. So I'm going to go contemplate the concept.

      Namely because you have to spend so much freaking time in them. I have a long story to tell today, not a very funny one either. I spent 6 hours in the hospital this morning.   It all started Saturday  The day I slammed my finger in the cash register while working. It didn't hurt then, but boy did it all go down hill from there. Sunday I was fine, everything was all good, ya know?? What came Monday morning totally threw me off guard. I woke up, and I noticed that my finger was really tender, it continued to bother me the entire day. I threw a bandaid on it thinking- it's just a cut or whatever, It'll be ok by tomorrow. I couldn't have been more wrong, by 9:00 a red mark was traveling down my finger. I washed my finger off, put some antibiotic cream on it, and loosely wrapped a different bandaid around it. By 9:45 my finger was twice the size of my other ones. Needless to say- I was a little worried. I called my mom and she told me to hang out until she got home. I iced my finger to reduce the swelling, but that wasn't working either, and a red mark was streaking all the way up my arm. At 11:00 I called my mom again and told her it was getting serious. She called back twenty minutes later and told me to get ready- we were going to the hospital.   The emergency ward was packed  There were people there with much worse stuff than I had. We checked in, got checked on, then were directed to the seats by 12:20. We waited in the waiting room until 2:00. During that time there was this one lady who was coughing really really badly. Finally they took her back, and came out and taped up the bench she was sitting on. I was a little nervous by then, but we got to the back soon. Within 20 mins the doctor had come to see me. She didn't take two seconds to diagnose- Cellulitous, extreme inflammation of the skin caused by bacteria. She told me that she was going to be giving me a huge dose of antibiotics, intravenously. I was like ok, this shouldn't be too bad. Wrong, again. The first nurse came in to stick me and start the drip, she tried me 2 times and failed both. One stick left a hellishly huge bruise on my right forearm. The next nurse came in, and he stuck me 2 more times without any luck at all. By this time I just wanna go home. The next guy comes in and stick me once with no luck, and then stuck me the 2nd time and it was in. I was so happy- I thanked him a million times. I laid back and talked to my mom while the drip dripped. about 20mins into the drip, some nurses came in and started stocking the cabinets and drawers. They were fooling around, throwing stuff and all. They ran into my drip three times, each time they did I flinched and winced to let them know how uncomfortable that made me. They laughed. They weren't stuck six times. After they left I lost it- I started crying. My mom was like "Meghan, whats wrong??" I just wanted to go home and sleep. The drip took and hour and forty-five minutes. Me and my mom were getting kinda loopy towards the end... what from lack of sleep and all. I started singing Christmas songs and she danced around the room (this was while the curtain was drawn around the room of course.). During the last ten minutes it was a race between the drip and my bladder- I had to pee sooo badly. Once it was done the nurse came in and took the Iv thing out and I ran(which was more like a shuffle of the feet) to the bathroom.    Finally we left the hospital.  And I was really worried about my mom. She had gotten like no sleep, and I could tell she was ready to pass out. We stopped for breakfast at an all night place and went home. On the way home I remember hearing the weirdest Christmas song.... it was to the beat of "macho, macho man" except it was like... "I want to beee like santa, santa claus". And then we got home and I went to sleep. I woke up later and here I am. My finger is still swollen, and the red mark is still there.  But I'm ok.

       Poetry Time!     "Stay (let me tell you how I feel)"     By: Meghan   Stay silent, If just for a moment. Don't speak, Don't cry, Let me look into your eyes.  Stay still, If just for a moment. Don't shake, Don't move, Let me hold on to you.  Stay here, If just for a moment. Don't run, Don't hide, Let me confide what I have inside.  Don't breathe, just listen, Let me state my position; I love you now, always have, always will.  And that's the way the I feel.     Just for a moment!

       *Sigh* I want to know his name.  It was so easy, he walked in. I could have just said "Hi" smiled real big and asked him for his name. But no, I had to smile... and remain silent. What's wrong with me?! Ah! I wasn't looking the best... I kinda looked like a skate punk in mah gray jacket and ski hat. Although- the messege on the hat could have thrown him off. Lol. My hat says Flirt. I'm sure he got a kick outta that one. Or maybe he didn't care. Idk- but I saw his mom with him tonight. He set up this chair thingie in the hallway for her. I was so tempted to walk over and ask her what her sons name was, but, that might have looked bad. LOL. Im such a dork- It's seriously so funny to watch me. I wish I had someone braver than I to stick with me and make me ask him his name. Then maybe I wouldnt have to wonder about it all the freaking time.   Aight- thats all  I know.. he must be some cool guy if I dedicate a post to him every tuesday. Well maybe I would know if I wasn't so shy! Ah! Leave me comments on how to get over this!    Love Always, Meg.

       I give up  I can't keep a solid commitment to this thing. At least I'm writing more often than I did last year. Today is different, however, because I have a funny story to tell. Are you ready? If not look away and scroll down to some of my boring stuff. There's plenty down there so you should keep busy! And now for the funny story:    The Day I Was Hit By Toliet Paper   Times were good back then, quiet and hardly any objects flying about this way and that. Jokes were being cracked here and there- mostly by me, and mostly about my brother. I was being annoying, I won't deny it, but I hardly think I deserved the punishment I would soon recieve from my mother. After I cracked one really good joke at my brother, my mom ran into the bathroom. Originally I thought that my joke had moved her to pee her pants, but I was horribly wrong. Little did I know that my mother was in the bathroom, armed with a roll of toliet paper, and ready to fire. I was unaware, so unaware. Out of nowhere a ball of pillowy softness flew towards me! I tried to duck, but it was to late. The sting of the pillowy softness hit me like a ton'o'bricks. "I been hit!" I screamed as I fell to the hallway floor. Shocked, I layed there until everyone stopped laughing.  And that was the day I got hit by toliet paper.   Other than that  I passed my driving class exam! Woo-Hoo! That means in-cars here I come. I can't wait... although, I hope I don't scare the instructor dude.    I have to go because:  I got homework to do, and I got to get ready for alex's early bball practice. (ACK THAT SUCKS!) This means I won't get to see cute basketball guy... *tear* it's so unfair.    Chow Ma

       The Stories of Today  First, I would like to point out that I was up extremely late last night trying to prevent my lungs from closing off... other than that..:   9 a.m  Little bro's basketball game. It was a slaughter.. the other team was taller, and way bigger than any of the guys on are team..(even if you combined some) Our guys were trying so hard- but they just kept getting pushed around out there. I felt bad for the kids, they tried so hard and lost by 15 points...   10 a.m  Writing class- It was fun this week cause we covered poetry! We did these awesome poetry exercises and I even got to read one of mine. It's hard being the only teenager in a room full of expierenced writers, but I lived. Afterwards I approached the teacher and asked if he had and suggestions on my poem. What he said next straight nearly put me in my grave. He told me that he would'nt change a word of it- it was perfect like it was. And once more, he liked it! I was like... wow. I was so excited I didn't stop smiling for like.. a whole hour. (Can you tell that I like the word like? I'm not a valley girl I swear it...)   1:35 p.m  Me and my mom head out shopping not knowing what we were going to find. We decided to head over to payless to check out shoes. Come to find out- they had the *cutest* black dress shoes you could possible ever find- so she bought them for me! Wee-hoo (carmens modified version of Woo-hoo)! I have prom shoes to go with my prom dress! We asked where we might find a cute purse and went there. After finding the perfect purse me and my mom were getting wiped- so we headed over to a card store to buy a thank you card. Barnes and Nobles was next on the store hit list, mainly because we needed coffee. For dinner- we got chinese takeout and took it home. It was really strange.. cuz I cracked my fortune and it said "You are almost there." I was like- almost where?! It was a profound moment.    Finito

       HOLY CRAP!  I haven't posted in three days... :-O. Wow, I even shocked myself on that one. I do have a good reason for not blogging however (well several actually). First- I was validating code on my blogskins.. making sure they were up to par and what not. I'm not even finished with that actually.. I only got a few of them done *ugh*. My second mission was to start working on layouts for my site.. and then I got distracted. My third and final mission was to of course find out if mystery basketball man played on any of the local high school teams. That was a bust. Not one picture... anywhere *tear*. This means that I will of course have to actually ask him for his name.... *coughs spastically* Like that's gonna happen. Maybe, I could like, accidentally bump into him.. or something. That would probably but me on his weird people radar. Who could blame him right? No body knows me cause I'm not in the school system... and... yea. I really dunno what to do.   Besides the obvious heartbreak  I saw an old friend at driving class yesterday. I won't go into great details.. but, since the crap she pulled with me I haven't trusted another person since. Really- she had some major issues. But that's ok cause I'm all the better for it.    Lala-te-da-do.  So- I've gotta go. I know that you love these posts... the ones where... i complain and then don't go into details and leave you hanging hideously (whether it be by my spelling or otherwise) by my very words and then I end it with something like:    Huttah!

       *sigh*  Another tuesday night, another missed chance to talk to that one guy. I really just want to walk up to him and say "Hey, I'm Meghan." Of course.. I would probably mess something up somewhere and it would sound like I was a complete idiot. He looks so interesting.. I mean, I know that sounds weird. But I like the way he "acts" and the way he's cool with the kids on the team he practices with.    *sigh, again*  I am really getting sick of being so shy. Once I know people I'm great, but when it comes to introductions and first time speakings... I choke, completely. I wanna go cry somewhere... erg. Since I lost my voice tonight- I tryed to make eye contact instead. I could never tell if he was looking at me, and I seriously doubt that he was. *sigh* Since eye contact obviously wasn't working out well, I resorted to writing a poem about him. Annnnnnnnd that was not working at all... *Why, O why, Am I so pathetic??* AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.   Now that I haven't gotten that out of my system  He looked really nice today. So I finally decided to jot down his character stats so I could use him as a character in a short story. I took the care not to be discreet... so I think he had some sorta idea that I was writing something about me. I hope it didn't make him mad. That would suck that someone I don't even know hates me already.    To Mystery Guy  I highly doubt that you would ever come across this blog entry, but in the unlikely case that you do- I just wanna say that I'm not stalking you *cough* and that I would really like to talk with you sometime.   In conclusion  I'm sad- I'm gonna go write some poems.     These Times Will Try Me

       AHEM  It's that time again, yes.. time to share my creative thoughts with you. This is a poem I wrote a few days ago, for someone special- don't ask who cause I don't know! Lol.. well, that's not the entire truth. I can name at least five people who I would have loved to read it too and meant it for them. But then they might think I'm so weird freak stalking them.. cause guys aren't ones for poetry. Or at least the ones I know aren't :-P. Onward with tha poetry!    "Where are You?"     By: Meghan     I am in love, With who I am not sure. But I can feel his presence out there, As I whisper my gentle prayer; Where are you?  Patiently I sit, Silent do I stay. Maybe he just walked by, Perhaps he will drop down from the sky. Where are you?  My soul longs for you, Crying my heart does seek you. I long to look into your eyes, Eyes that could never tell me lies. Where are you?  Come fill my heart with childish glee, Please come and never leave. Take my heart and make it whole, Say that you will never let me go. Here I am - But where are you?    Erg Da Jerg (slur for Erk the Jerk)

        Ahh the things that happen late at night   I decided to write a poem. I am no poet so don't expect this to be the greatest thing you've ever read. I like it though. Here goes:    This is my life     a poem by: Meghan   The world I live in, Is dull and grey, If I could change it, I would say;  To heck with the world, And all that dwell within, This is my life,  not yours to fill in.  But I'm only sixteen, Not ready to fight, This world will try to change me In the matter of one night.  I am smart, I am kind, But the life in my eyes, Is starting to unwind.  She was too smart, She was too kind, They won't realize, What they've killed inside.  My curiousity, My spunk, My wit, My pride, In my mind,  I'm starting to hide.  I won't come out,  I don't fit in, The slideshow of my life Is about to begin.  Laughter rings from the world's mouth, My life seems a hoax, Nothing but a little girl's attempt At turning the wheel's spokes.  This laughter it kills, What was hanging on so tight, The hope I once had, Takes it's last flight.  Time is running out,  Luck is in the past,  My life is running away, And running away fast.   You can't catch me, O wicked world and those within, I'm to lost now, My life is at it's end.  I take my last breath, As I start to drown, In the words that were spoken, By the world's crowd.  The world rings out "Silly Girl!" washed away in an instant. The threat she once posed, Is now but distant.  As the world reviews the video of my life, They suddenly realized, How one mistake, Could cause so much strife.  The mistake that they made, was not believing in me. But now it's too late, For mere apologies.  Listen carefully to what I say, Do not give into the world and all it's beliefs. Your life should be lived, Without such grief.  A burden to share,  Is a burden much less. Live your life through no other, Let your heart rest.  Say to the world: "To heck with you and all that dwell within, This is MY LIFE, It's not yours to fill in."   Ahem, so ya.  That was my poem. And it's pretty long so I think that's all I'm going to write today. :-P    It's My Life-Don't You Forget.

       YaY!  Finally got the Orlando Bloom skin done that I have been working on all day. It's pretty spiffy- you can see it  urlLink here . I used a brush from  urlLink 1greeneye.net  for the background, and I used a pic of Orlando Bloom that I cut myself. I been learning to cut stuff in ps, and so far I got like 6 pics of orlando cut... obsessive? I don't think so. He's hot :-P.   Other than that  I'm still sick. I didn't sleep at all last night. My mom was cool and let me have the day off school since I was feeling so crappy. That means double work tomorrow... argh. O well, at least this gave me time to work on some graphic stuff.    This was short  But it got the job done. I could probably make up some story about how oranges plan to take over the earth, but as I said, I'm tired and feel like crap so thats not gonna happen. Today. Anyways.    The oranges are coming!

       Crap.  Another day skipped on the blog. *wipes dust of the keyboard* I was sick AGAIN yesterday, but this time I knew it was my asthma. Went to the doc's yesterday to find that out... they took a bunch of crappy tests like the ekg (Ok, yea this doesn't hurt or anything but it's weird because your laying shirtless on a freaking cold examination bed while the nurses chat on about whatever while putting the little sensory things around your exposed upper body.) Apparently my heart wasn't the problem. The doc man seems to think that my asthma, in wake of my killer flu, has decided to try and close my lungs. Nice huh? So here I am having all these stupid breathing problems. I wish I had never gotten sick to begin with. It all started with cellulitus early December, then progressed until I was totally spent. I am so tired, still coughing my brains out, and on millions of meds.    Apart from my illness spat  I'm pretty good. Been laying around watching some movies like  Shrek  and  Cutthroat Island . Did I ever mention that I adore pirate movies? Don't ask why... just another fetish of mine. Where's my life of adventure ey?! Where's my irresistibly hot pirate-man? *sigh* Did I mention that I hate being sick?    Graphically Speaking  I've gotten some stuff done! I made some new brushes for ps, mostly out of traffic signs and yummy pics of Orlando Bloom. Dude- there is this one pic of him... and he has his makeup all funkish, which is kinda weird but doesn't diminish his good looking-ness. I like Orlando Bloom. I think he's hot. But then again, who doesn't? I wish I could meet him.. just once, to see what kinda personality went with the face. I hate that publicity makes every actor and actress look so untouchable, just like, their not a person. Maybe I'll become an actress one day just to see how all the other ones live their lives.    Well  I must go... and I know that brings a tear to your eye but you'll get over it as soon as  Smallville  comes on ;-D

       So it's monday  School was for the most part pretty simple, which was probably good because I wasn't feeling very well today. I don't know why I have been feeling so crappy but mom made an appointment for the doctor so I should find out tomorrow.   Been trying out some of the writing exercises in the class manual  I gotta say- they are kinda fun. The one I did most recently was "Write about a rock". You might think that sounds really boring but it isn't. I sat there, thinking about how a rock would feel, and then I wrote it down. Simple stuff right?? Too bad my english is so terrible, if my english had been better it might actually have been good! Well, I am going to blog it for storage puposes so here goes:     What it Feels like to be a Rock.     By: Meghan   For many years people have passed by me, wondering why I sat alone on this soft, grassless dirt. There is no other sign of life between the place where these people come from, and the place that they are going. Some of the passerbys stop to get a good look at my dented appearence and grey complextion. Only in their imagination can they see the life that I have lived and the people that have passed by me.   To the untrained soul I have lived no life. "A rock has no being," they say to themselves. What the viewers really see is a reflection of their own lives. When one looks at a rock, a rush of thoughts comes towards them. Inside their heads an image comes to life and they associate me (the rock) with that image.   I can hear the thoughts that race through the minds of the people that pass by. To one I may represent strength, and to another I may represent peace. The life that I live is not full of colors or movement, but of silent meditation and unsurpassible understanding. One downside may be that I cannot express my feelings or emotions.   When a hard rain falls like bullets from above, I feel cold. As the thunder and the lightning compete for the sky, I become scared. Shining through the night I see the moon and I am happy. Suddenly, everything stops, and I do not feel the life that once seeped through my weather-worn cracks. I am alone.  Shining like diamonds on a black velvet curtain, I count the millions of stars on their stage. If I made the same wish on each and every star maybe, just maybe, it might come true. I would wish for color like a rainbow and movement like a gazelle. In their immense pity for me, one star may grant my wish. O, how extatic I would be! To live like the people that pass by would certainly make me happy. Wouldn't it? Perhaps the real question was whether or not I wanted to be like those people that pass by me each day.  Sitting on the soft, grassless dirt I thought about the people I had seen walking past me earlier that day. A thought that had never occured to me before popped into my head and refused to leave. "They are all the same." my inner voice tells me, "You are a rock and should be proud to have a title as such." I was different, I was unique, I was a rock. In my serene understanding silence I watched as a little girl walked by with her mother. "Mommy!" the little girl shouted, "Look at that rock!" The girl's mother scolds her gently to calm her down. "Honey, we musn't scream unless things frighten us." the mother says. The little girl looks shamefully up at her mother and trys to explain, "But mommy, that rock   smiled  at me!" A look of astonishment came over the mother's face as she turned to examine me. Once she was quite sure that I was not smiling, she turned back to her young child and said, "That's very silly, sweetie, because rocks cannot smile." Dismayed and in doubt, the little girl turns to look at me once more. I tryed to smile with all my might, but did not know if she could see. Confidently the little girl turned back to her mother and said simply, "He smiles when I smile."   So it doesn't quite bring you to tears  Thanks ok, it's just my first try. I hope to get better soon. Creative writing is something I never thought I would enjoy until I sat in on the saturday writing class. Who knows? Maybe I'll get good at it some day.    Peace out to my buddy Rock.

       Oops!  I forgot to blog yesterday, but only because I was sick. That's alright though because becca and carmen blogged in my absence! You guys rock!    Moving On  My brother's team won their basketball yesterday! It was a thourghly gut-wrenching game. If the game had been any more competitive than it was, there would have been blood all over the floor! Those little dudes worked their heart out on that game, and you could tell too cause the score ended up being on 27-24. I almost flew straight out of my seat when my brother almost made a 3 pointer from the outside-right. The basketball flew in- hit the back of the rim- spun around-and flew back out. It was a truly inspired shot since the guy guarding him was like 3 inches taller than he was. I love watching the basketball games, it's great to get out there and cheer for little dudes (by little I mean 11.. which is not really little, but some of them are kinda short). Although, I did secretly wish that we were playing the team we practice with so I could see the hot german guy.....   About the writing class  The class was awesome. I am learning alot about creative writing. The only problem though is that there isn't enough teenagers in there. I mean- 2 ppl my age?? The rest of them were at least 25 or way older. This one lady even asked me how old I was. When I told her I was 16 she says, "How cute!" How cute?! Argh. I don't even have any writing talent I don't see why she should think that it was cute. Anyways- the author was really awesome and he gave a lot of good information. I think I will start writing stuff more often.   After the writing class I went shopping  My mom, brother and I all jumped into the car and headed for the local mall. We looked around in a few odd stores. My brother was trying to find a gift for a friend, and I was trying to blow my money. "Hey lets go into the christmas store," said my mom. I spotted something straight away, it was a horse figure with a Van Gogh painting on it. I am crazy about Van gogh and I love horses too so I stepped away to ponder if I would buy it. Three minutes later I turned around and it was gone! The lady who had been watching my mother and I look at the horse was buying it at the counter. ARGH- I hate malls for that very reason. I was disheartened so we went to  urlLink Build-A-Bear  were you can make these awesomely cute teddy bears. I'm nuts about teddy bears. I made the valentine bear, got him some valentines boxers, and called him Mr. FluffNStuff. My brother bought the horse thing and decorated him with the birtday kit. It was soooo cute! I'm sure his friend is gonna love it.    Once we left the mall I went to walmart  I kinda got sick while I was there so I left after a few minutes. I stayed in bed the rest of the night. How fun huh? Ahh well I got Mr. FluffNStuff from the day so it wasn't all bad.    Erg Da Jerg (slur for Erk the Jerk)

       Got a new Journal today  But have no fear, it's only for my writing class. I got a spiffy mechanical pencil to write with while I was blowing my money, so I wouldn't be without a handy dandy writing tool. I hope the writing class goes well, I mean, I'm not all that good at english and I have never taken a good crack at poetry. This could be a dilemma- the author dude man is a poet! Ahhhh I hope everything goes ok. Maybe I can sit in the back and not be noticed. I highly doubt that's possible though, maybe he will find the star student and ask them all the questions. Either way, I have to go to the class. I told my mother when she suggested the idea, "Hey that sounds ok." Now I'm thinking, "Crap! What have I gotten myself into!"    It's not that I don't like poems  I love poems. I just can't write them very well. O sure I've had my crack at poems. I wrote one for a friend once. I poured my heart out into it to try to make him see how he was making me feel. He didn't even read the poem. I deleted it.   So, I'm a little nervous  Other than that I am ok.     Chow ma!

       Shalalala means- Shutup please!  I have been so grumpy today. Everybody was getting on my nerves. The reason for the grumpiness was most likely the history test. AP American History is slightly a pain in my bum. I mean- scalawags is an awesomely sweet word and all, but I'm just not at all into American History. I love European History though... which is slightly strange. Does that make me- o forget it lol.    Hero of the Day  No, it's not you again Carmen. It's strongbad. The dude has some incredible talent answering emails like he does. I totally did the WWE outfit too. It rocks. If you don't know who strongbad is than you have been seriously deprived. I suggest you go to  urlLink HomestarRunner  immediately.   Been redoing my website  Yea- I've been redoing it for about 5 months now. I wasn't actually doing anything, just claimed that I was to make it look like I didn't have commitment issues. But anyways I got the background done. It's super spantactical. I'm not going to tell you what it looks like though because it's a secret. I think I will launch the site sometime in the near future.   In the mean time  I'm listening to a song Ritu sent me. It's "Do you believe in magic"- by loving spoonful. It's one of those "Get your butt outta the computer chair and dance all around the room", songs.     HUTTAH!

       What a boring day  It's been absolutely uneventful. My schoolwork wasn't to heavy or mentally straining. The only big event of the day was going to the store with my mom. We bought various stuff- including this awesome canjun trail mix. And then we came back home. No big story there.   I started reading "The Bell Jar" today  It's by Sylvia Plath. So far I've gotten through the first chapter. I admit it's got some potential, but so far my all time favorite read is "Atlas Shrugged", by Ayn Rand. People always wrinkle their noses when they hear that a 15 (age I was when I read it) actually got through that book with some recollection of what it was about. I also hear all this crap about "But your a Christian, why would you want to read a book like that?", I just shrug my shoulders and say, "Why did Darwin rewrite his theory on evolution six times?". I'm an open-minded person. No, that does not mean I'm worldly and hypocritical thank you. I read what I want to read because I feel like reading it- so simple right? I wish. When you tell someone that you have read such and such book, they automatically assume that they can judge your character by the book. What's up with that?!    Aside from my rant  I've got to find something to do. Let's see.... I could make a list! Those are fun. Ok it's settled, I'm making a list.    The List    Top Ten things to do when your bored  1. Make a list 2. Blog 3. Search for good quotes 4. Search for song lyrics 5. Im people you don't know and claim that you know them because you met them at the local walmart 6. Call a pizza place and try to order chinese. (I recommend cheese wontons) 7. Go into a chatroom and, using a translator, speak in a foreign language (french always works for me) 8. Repeat over and over in a AIM window "Mi gusta el naranjas" (I like oranges) 9. Draw sarcastic but very funny drawings all over post-its and stick them to various parts of your house. 10. Pull out the physics book, cover it in meat flavored spaghetti sauce, and yell "Here doggy doggy!".    Bonne Nuit

       Sigh.  There was a mucho caliente guy at alex's basketball practice today. He was practicing with the other team. I've actually seen him a couple of times before. I tried not to make eye contact- I'm slightly shy... plus I didn't want to look like I was watching his fine body trying to dunk the basketball, er, I mean, stalking him with my eyes. He's really cute! He has this awesomely curly hair that's brown with goldish highlights. My dad cracked a joke about it, he's like, "How would you like to see me in that hair!". Thanks dad- way to score points for me! Anyways, I think the dude is on a basketball team. Maybe the local highschool team.. Idk. I tried to make out his eye color but he never was close enough for me to actually determine. But I think they are brown? My mom claims he is German... *coughs*    So anyways  He totally was showing off, but that's beside the point. We almost made eye contact as I was walking to the bathroom. *Magic* ahh... He probably has a girlfriend. Scratch probably- does. *sigh* WHERE'S MY PERFECT DUDE?! Arg.. *Plays enchanting music so all the fine guys migrate her way*    And Finally  Watch- I'll probably end up in some relationship like Beatrice and Benedict in Much Ado About Nothing. We're mortal enemies, exchange a fair amount of insults, then fall in love without even thinking about it in the first place. That would be just my luck.

       Attack of the killer Algebra II test.  "We go to a scene quite similar to something you might have saw in Carrie, or Carrie 2", reports field agent Mr. Pencil. "Mister Pencil, can you please tell us how this all started?", says the newscaster who resembles a clipboard. "Well it all started around 11:30 a.m., When an irate student became enraged at a test and found an abandoned match laying nearby. Apparently, she struck the match on the back of a local calculator and set the book community on fire." The newscaster resembling a clipboard just shakes his head. Mr. Pencil too, shakes his head. "casualty reports are coming in all over the place Dan", reports Mr. Pencil, "The book community took a huge hit this time. So far, the book community has lost the History Book, the English book, and sadly, the Physics book. I don't know how they are going to recover loses like that". Suddenly, the broadcast is interrupted by the horrifying shrills of dozens of quizzes that were running for their lives. The newscaster, the one who resembled a clipboard, again shakes his head.    Ok so it wasn't quite that dramatic.  But I was on the edge of losing my sanity. Again. There was one question about an airplane. After doing the problem I was thinking in terms of matches and lighter fluid as I usually do after any trying question. I'm quite hilarious whenever I have a brain cramp. I start mumbling things that don't mean sense and then I go back and try to make sense of them. Like typos- only better!   Well... I should probably go.  I'm tired from coding becca's surprise blog skin and I got to take my little brother to basketball practice. I might blog before bed.     Chow ma!

       Ok, I have no energy  So instead of thinking up my own incredible and convicting stuff- I'm gonna post some awesome song lyrics instead. Don't be biased because its a Christian group. They are awesome lyrics whether you like the band or not!    Quest of Many Trials   If your tears want out than let them fall, They'll hit your cheeks and then dissolve. You see nothing heals quite like time, It fills the gap between dreams and real life, So give your pain a chance to run itself dry.  Remember the story without all the hurt, Hold on to the fruit and wash off all the dirt. You see life's bittersweet, and sweet's the best part. You'd never rate your happy, without sad on the chart.  (Chorus) Stars colliding against the dark of the night, You'll climb over the moon tonight, On your quest of many trails.  Remember, will you remember who brought you here? Remember, o will you remember who brought you here? Remember, will you remember?   That's a great song.  It's by  urlLink Plus One . I'm not infatuated with their stuff but I do like some of their songs like "Last Flight Out" and "Kick Me". That's not all I listen to though. I listen to lotsa other stuff. But right now I don't feel like listing the groups.   Why so worn?  School- first day back. I had make up work stacked about a mile high, including an Algebra II semester final. *gaaaaaaa* *throws a TI80 or w.e at the wall* Surprisingly I remembered stuff, and was able to crack out a solid 8 questions before going into deep brain-fry mode. Suddenly I was thinking in mathmatical terms like, if I had a matches and b amount of lighter fluid how long would it take to burn z amount of school work. Don't get me wrong, I'm a brain child. I just like to complain about it, because that's what I do.   Great now it looks like I actually posted  Crap! I'm a typa-holic! Well not really but I made a New Year's Resolution to blog at least every other day if not everyday. Some people might say, "So what! No one ever keeps their New Year's Resolutions". Maybe their right, but this year I got Mista Jiggyfly cheering me on so you know I got to make him proud. (For those of you just joining me, Mista Jiggyfly is my Barnes and Nobles bear. Some of you may be questioning why I have to make him proud, well, its something you would have to know me for to understand it.)    Um, now I'm going to stop typing and end the blog with a tongue-pleasing and funny phrase     Cheerio!

       Sigh..  Winter break is over and its back to school time. I wish someone would hurry up and invent a time machine so I could jump back and re-live winter break in a different way. For one, I wouldn't be sick so I could make the most of my time. But then maybe something wouldn't have happened. Like I wouldn't have found my awesome prom dress. Why does time have to be so complicated? I mean its there, then its gone. If you try to change it, something even potentially worse could end up happening. Like- you make someone mad and per chance it causes a global war somewhere in the near future. Time is pissant. I hate time. People say, why can't life be fair? Its because time and life skip heinously through a field of your dreams and kick the petals as if they were nothing, and are nothing.    I'm a deep thinker  But only when I don't want to be. I was just sitting, thinking about if I wanted to ask someone to my prom when all of the sudden I started thinking about time. Maybe because my birthday is coming up soon, and my closest friends won't be here. It's weird that I had to go all the way to chicago to find them. I want them to be there really badly, but I know that's not going to happen. So- time sucks. I wish so much that I could be back there in summer '03 kicking it with the top minds (and some top losers) and laughing it up with all those guys. I'm gonna miss that the most this summer. Not being able to hang out with them, or cram with them, or slack-off the work with them.    I sound like some sentimental freak  Yea, its been hitting me hard lately. I don't want to grow up. I want to be like wendy and fly off with the hot peter pan to never-never land, and stay there. Its almost not far the way a person has to grow up. First your 5 and having a good ol' time finger painting and napping, then next thing you know your an Adult. You have to make your own discisions and pay the bills and go to work. It hardly seems fair.   Anyways  I should really stop blabbing because I have some last minute homework to do. Bonne nuit.

       Posting: 1, 2, 3  Did some updates to the prom website today. Ahhhh Im so excited. The prom website was my first ever big time website. I liked designing it and everything. Im thinking bout redoing my own website. When? ahh Idk.   On a non-website or prom note  My brother, mom and I went to see Mona Lisa smile today. I thought it was a pretty good movie. It's sad though, very sad. Im glad I live in the end 90's/00's decade. I can be crappy and selfish as a woman, and people will just shrug it off as pre-menopausal or hormones.   Well-  I gtg. Movies are calling.

       The Great Prom Dress Caper  Meh, this would have been wrote yesterday if blogger hadn't been down. Onward with the story!    The Real Great Prom Dress Caper  It all started Thursday, January 1st, of 2004. I hopped into the car with my mom expecting to go grocery shopping. Little did I know, we were about to go dress shopping. My mom said to me "We are going to Jcpenny". "Jcpenny doesn't sell food", I replied. "Stop being a smart-alec", rebuttals my mom, "We are going to look at prom dresses". I wasn't stunned. My mom had had prom fever since May of '03.   Well, we got to Jcpennys and went straight to the dress section expecting to see formalwear and evening wear. Wrong. Jcpennys had absolutely nothing. As my mom and I walked out to the car, we thought about places that would have nice prom dresses. "Let's go to that one mall", says my mom. "O ya!", I reply, "I gotta buy Arturo's Christmas gift there anyways." So we again hop in the car and drive to that mall. Once there, we made a plan. "Ok- Hot Topic first, then we will wonder around aimlessly until we find a store with nice dresses. Sound good?", I said to my mom. "Yea sounds fine", she replys. So we went to Hot Topic to buy a gift, then we started wondering around. Finally we got the guts up to ask a salesdude where we might find a decent prom dress. "Lazarus", he says, "That is, if they haven't sold out already". I laughed inside, because it was not a very funny joke.  Once at Lazarus we made for the formals section.  On the way there, some lady stopped my mom and said, "Did you just graduate?". My mom was wearing a college themed sweat shirt. "No", said my mom. The lady talked to us for ten minutes about the college and the town it was in. She was nice so it didn't bother my mom and I. Once we were done talking to the lady, we continued on towards the formals. We we finally got there I noticed a sale sign, 30% off. But my mom and I were just "looking". Little did we know that my soon-to-be prom dress was calling to us. I searched the racks and found something very pretty in my size. I told my mom I was gonna try it on. I walked into the Lazarus dressing room, not expecting what would happen next. I put the dress on and came out to the main viewing area- the dress was so amazing! I fell in love with the dress right there. A passing lady even commented, "Wow, that is a really lovely dress", she says. I felt like a princess almost, and I never felt  that way in a dress before. My mom was iffy though. She said "You shouldn't go with the first dress you try on meg". "But mom, if this was the first dress you tryed on, wouldn't you want it too?", I pleaded with my mom.   We ended up leaving my perfect dress at the perfect price there, at Lazarus, and not in our car. My mom and I continued on to a giant bridle store. I had three crappy dresses to try on. They were plain, and plain, and crappy. I was upset over leaving my perfect dress. My mom finally pulled me out of the dressing room and said "Come on, these aren't what I expected at all." We then ventured to a fabric store to try to get a name of a seamstress. After that we headed to Taco Bell for lunch. Over lunch, my mom and I talked about the dresses. When we left taco bell, my mom was acting funny. Suddenly, while we were driving home, my mom said, "It was a really pretty dress wasn't it.". "Yes it was, mom. It's the one that I want." My mom drove into a little alcove off the side of the road and tryed to turn around. That wasn't working so we got on the highway and tryed to get off at the next exit. What really ended up happening- is we got off on one exit, then another, then we came to this road, and unintentionally went around in a big circle right back to the mall! "The dress is calling to us", I told my mom. So it was a little corny. We got back to Lazarus, and ran for the formals section. I tryed the dress on again, then took it off and gave it too my mom so she could get it to the checkout. It ended up costing only $107.35. And my mom was cool enough to pay $57.35 of it.    Everyone loves my dress and I love my dress. I totally cannot wait for prom.

      And I'm feeling that 16-year-old vibe. My mom has been pretty cool about it so far. She bought me big ballons that are in the shapes of a 1 and a 6.. (no, I'm not 61...) And she got me this awesome cake. She also let me higlight my hair yesterday! Woo-hoo! I got golden blonde highlights and they look awesome... Although- she did kinda get em lumped all together on the left side. It's ok, it still looks awesome!    The perks of being 16  My parents are pretty strict, so for me 16 means alot of stuff. Like, I'm allowed to "officially" date, I am allowed to highlight my hair (as long as it isn't pink or blue or green or purple...) I am allowed to wear makeup (I actually snuck that in around 15..) amoung some other things.  Plus- I can drive. Well, when I get my license I can drive.    I wonder what else my mom has planned  I know she just barely scratched the surface today. She said that she didn't want me to feel like Molly Ringwald in  Sixteen Candles . I guess that's a good reason to make my birthday awesome...    As for my friends..  I have no idea who is doing what. So far I haven't gotten any cards or gifts :-(. It's most likely that I won't. People other than my family tend to forget my birthday pretty easily. My grandparents sent a card... it was very nice. I wonder how old they think I am this year. (Last year I was still 13...)   Well...  I gotta go get ready to see  Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights ! I have been wanting to see it ever since I saw the teaser trailer. I can't wait!!! Hopefully it will be as good as the first one. But then again, sequels and prequels have the tendancy to suck. O well! Still can't wait!    I leave you with this important announcement: I'm still single....(lol)

      Until my birthday. Great huh? Ya.. well we shall see.    It seems...  That operation hair is going to start earlier than I planned. This Saturday in fact... stay tuned for the details. I might even add a pic if your lucky. Are you lucky?    Today was a one fortune day.  Yep- chinese again today. Call me crazy, I don't care! I had some really good stuff today though.. general tso's chicken and spring egg rolls. It was supra (yes, "supra") good. I went with my dad and kid brother. I of couse, got to do all the driving. Driving is pretty awesome. When I'm not in an in-car with a big fat "student driver" sticker on the side that is. You know what's weird? Here I am.. almost 16, and I have never been on a highway. I blame my mother. Why? Because I can, that's why. She is supposed to take me driving tonight though, so no worries. You might want to say a little pray for my safety though, lol. Sounds bad I know, but it isn't. I'm not THAT bad of a driver. At least I don't think so.     I leave you with this important information: I have no important information.

      So today was pretty crappy. As, most of you probably could have predicted. There is really nothing new to report, I'm still sick and still behind in my schoolwork. Woop-de-doo! Anyways, my mom felt bad for me so she bought me some Chinese food today. Apparently- the waiter guy got a little excited and dumped about 12 fortune cookies into the to-go bag. I was excited naturally.. I think fortune cookies are awesome. I began cracking em' and found the fortunes were slighty crappy, and the cookies were stale to boot. I found one good fortune out of my chosen 4.... it said "A surprising change is coming your way!" I thought it was a pretty awesome fortune. Pretty awesome for me anyways. I've been in this "mental lull" and I can't seem to get out of it. I'm hoping that my bday puts me in some better spirits. Even if it doesn't, I've still planned a buncha crap to do that day to keep me busy. I'll spare you the bulleted list, but just to give you an idea;   Operation: Hair  Ok, so I've had the same hair style since I was like.. ten. Sure, it's been shorter and times. But, I really wanna do something drastic. Some might say I'm taking a chance since prom is coming up soon, but hey, I could always wear a tight Elvis wig right? Anyways, I'm gonna get my hair about.. touching shoulder length, and I'm gonna get sandy blonde highlights in it. Maybe not as bold as you imagined, but prom is only 2 months away.   Operation: Good Lunch  I'm going to the best restaurant ever- the Mongolian barbecue. It's my absolute fav. restaurant besides all Chinese restaurants.. lol. I'm going with my family, which is sure to be a mistake. Knowing my mom she'll tell the waiter that it's my birthday and then he/she will say "Really?!" and then precede to congratulate me or sing. And I will proceed to blush until you can't tell that I'm white anymore.   Operation: Build-a-Bear  Everybody wants a keepsake from their 16th birthday right? Well.. I love teddy bears so I decided on that. What I don't know is what I'm gonna make... I've already made like 5 of the things. Got a suggestion? Leave me a comment and I might consider it.   Operation: Read Emails and Ims that say "O, today was your birthday? I completely forgot........... HAPPY BIRTHDAY"  Yeah... theres no love like the love that says "I forgot your birthday". Just so we are all clear- my birthday is March 1st, for all those forgetful people out there. I don't need fireworks or anything, but an ecard would be nice. If you don't have time for even that, than don't bother talking to me for AT LEAST a month.   And In Conclusion  See, I told you it wasn't going to be a "bulleted" list. Yes, It was a list. But it wasn't a bulleted one. Aren't I clever? Don't answer that. Anyways- the countdown is on: 7 days. Leave me comments on stuff I should do!!    Never Pet a Beaver Backwards.. Just Trust Me On This One.

       Why Valentine's Day Sucks  I made a list actually, seeing as I had multiples of time on my hands today due to lack of "Hunnie Pie's" and "I love you more's". It's not that I don't mind being single on Valentines Day- but it's hard to be constantly reminded of what you may or may not be missing while your walking through a local Wal-Mart, seeing guys and girls rushing this way and that, diving for vday candies and vday cards and sometimes, the occastional pink monkey. I'm not pathetic.. just sad. So I sat around thinking of how I could justify my pain by blaming it on the injustice of a crappy holiday. I came up with this lovely top ten list, cleverly intitled "The Top Eight Things to Ruin Valentines Day". I know your just aching to hear it. The list is in no specific order mind you... just in the top ten.    The Top Eight Things to Ruin Valentines Day   [1].  Inflation(ism): Valentines Day is probably the most inflated (price wise) holiday of the year. I even dreamed up a mastercard commercial for it..." A dozen long stem red roses that will die within a week, 60$. A box of assorted "coronary-to-go" chocolates, 10$. A Valentines Day card that your love will most likely end up burning when you break up, 3$. Seeing the crinkled look on your loves face that says "Man, this stuff is crap!". Priceless."  [2]. The overly aggressive PDA: Not that I have a problem with couples showing that they are together... but I mean, when you get nausious at a Barnes and Nobles from watching a couple "cuddle" in a reading chair, that's just sick.   [3]. The Dentists and The Personal Trainers horror: Lets face it, chocolate may be good for your heart and soul, but it's not a great friend to your butt and thighs. Chocolates have some of the highest fat and carb rates of any candy... and whats worse.. the better they taste, the higher factor of you having to work out for a full month to drop the pounds you gained from eating that one box of chocolates. Plus- It's bad for your teeth.  [4]. "You've lost that loving feeling": Or.. the song dedications. As you sit and listen to the radio.. you might here one or two of these. People get on and spill their guts to that other person who probably isnt even listening to the radio... as you sit there wondering where the crap these people are/come from, and why you didn't meet them first!  [5]. Seeing Movies: You are bombarded with couples from anywhere and everywhere- while you sit there with your popcorn and listen to them comment to each other about the movie.. and themselves. You can't throw popcorn and tell them to shutup- because their in love! And it's Valentines Day! And- Who cares?! Plus their making out at every make-out scene in the movie.. and you just want to say "For God's Sakes- Go get a room!"   [6]. The day where the words "I love you" are most abused: I have no problem when people say I love you.. in fact I think it's kinda cute. But- when you here a person chant it like there getting ready to do the heart shaped cupcake rain dance.. than its too much.  [7]. Random telephone calls: You know Valentines Day sucks when you get a phone call from a total stranger asking for another total stanger with " I love you more than you will eva know, (insert 2nd strangers name here). And you stay silent for a moment, thinking, "I wonder what it would be like to be stranger 2."  [8]. The colors: Valentines Day has an enormous amount of pink involved..... and pink is the color of rashes.

       So, I haven't posted  As some of you may have noticed- I was in a totally crappy mood for about.. o.. a week. But I'm better now. The medicine the doc man prescribed is finally working thank God. I can actually breathe through my nose again guys! Isn't that super splender-fer-ific! Yea, I thought so too.    Ok so anyways.  Life has been pretty good the past couple of days. Just saturday we went to look at the prom site again, and it was looking more awesome than ever. I also got to meet brittney and her mom, people who will hopefully be coming to the prom. I had an awesome time- and I had the most amazing salad I have ever ate in my life. It was the chicken cesar salad at Olive Garden... and.. the waiter was "mmm mmm good". Haha. Yea he was mucho caliente and I think he knew it. What was funny is.. I was trying to get his attention so I could snag some too go boxes, and so finally, I had to just stick my hand out and say "Ok, lets just stop right there for a second". It was so hilarious.     Sleep is calling to me.. I shall go answer it...

      I'm not quite sure what I did right in a previous life, but it must have been something super great. Why for so? You may ask in your puzzled amusement. Because there is this awesome guy who lives in Chicago who is always trying to out-do my presents to him with presents from him. It sounds like a perpetual gift war- right? Maybe. However it came about that I have a cool guy friend in Chicago sending me presents... I may never know. I just know that he's made my day awesome beyond words.   Maybe I should explain...  I'm not used to guys returning gifts for gifts. I usually just give them gifts, they say thanks, forget my birthday, and never send me anything. Case in point: Kevin So-and-So.  Me and Kevin So-and-So meet online and hit it off well enough. Before I knew it... my mom was calling his mom and we were long-distance buddies. I sent him a ton of crap, mostly because he was always depressed about something and needed cheering up, or just for the sheer joy of sending someone something by way of the U.S Postal Service. He sent cards and letters and stuff, but most of it inconsequential. I was constantly arguing with him about not treating me like his little sister (I was 14, he was 16), and he was content to do the opposite. One day, I noticed he wasn't talking all to much, so I asked him if he was talking to a ton of other people. He said; "Nah, just talking to this girl from (insert state here)". So I jokingly replied "O so now she is more interesting to talk to than me?". He hit me with a statement I will never forget... "She's the mashed potatoes and your just the gravy." Yea, sure he meant that as a joke. But seriously- would you tell a friend that someone you had just met is more important than you are?! I decided that since I was obviously a nuisance to him just to cut it off. We haven't spoke to each other in over a year. And now, he's engaged. (he turns 19 in September... I think..)  So, I'm not really used to this "You give me a gift, I give you a gift." I usually just give without any thought of getting anything back. That's just how I am. Maybe you can see why I had to write this post then.    Arturo and I met at camp  In the summer of 02'. I was taking Honors Ecology and he was taking Persuasion and Debate Honors. Now, I'm not really sure how the whole thing got started, but I do remember that the first time I saw him was at the CTD showing of  Monty Python and the Holy Grail  . He was sitting behind me and Maria (Maria, Marie???), and when the movie was over we all started playing cards. Playing cards was like, the only thing anyone did at CTD lol. After the movie, we all went to dinner together. Me and Maria sprung for a table in the back.. and the only thing I remember clearly is Arturo taking a dive into the chairs. He was, eh, running maybe? I'm not sure but I do remember him getting up and saying that he was all right whilst me, Sarah, and Maria laughed until we couldn't breathe. Yea... good times. So we all hung out on various occations. It was fun cause, I annoyed the heck out of Arturo and he annoyed the heck out of me. It was like, a mutual annoyance, but I still loved (I say that in the "friendly" manner) him anyways. Before I knew it, camp was over, and I went back to (insert state here). You know how everyone promises to KIT? Well... it never actually happens.    That next summer  I went back to CTD so I could flaunt my "older than all ya'll" stance. I hadn't heard from Arturo, let alone seen him since the last day of camp from the previous summer. I seen him... maybe like... the third day, while walking to an activity. Now, he had obviously seen me too, so he said hey or hi or whatever people say when seeing someone that they hadn't seen in awhile. I'm not quite clear on what I did next, I think I may have kept on walking or turned around and said "Yeah??". Anyways, when I did finally stop to talk to him, he told me that he had lost my email addy (as he is good at losing a lot of things in various places) and thus, couldn't reach me. So, I was like, ok well that's understandable. We started hanging out again, although, not as much. Why?  1. Because I had an enormous amount of work (no joke) 2. Because he was still a commuter, which does make it a bit difficult. 3. And Because we did different activities.  We still found the time to hang out though... He kept me sane. I was in a group with a buncha 7th graders and 8th graders who were, well, as me and ritu called it "Giglish". There were people in my group who I loved bunches (Ellen, the coolest 7th grader I have ever met, and Ritu- my companion dork.). But most of them just drived me insane. So it was cool to have someone to talk to that was neither A. Giglish, or B. under the age of 13.    We always found time to be ticked off at each other.  Funny as that may sound. The first summer, he was mad at me for hooking him up with Maria for the last dance and "ruining his/her life". I think we worked it out at the end of the dance or something, but, yeah, all I know is that I left the dance early cause I felt like crap and just wanted to go home.   The second summer, I was mad at him. He had come to socialize in the dorms on the last Friday of camp and left all his stuff in there. He talked to me for awhile, then headed to this one girls (the girl he was crushing on that summer) and had left all his stuff in my room. Well, me and my friends decided to head to dinner early and we completely missed each other so he could grab his stuff. So his sister came to me after dinner and asked for me to get his stuff cuz he had his music for the talent show in one of his bags. I brought all his stuff down only to carry two-thirds of it back upstairs. So.. she had what he need now... or so I thought. On my way to the talent show he came running over and said "My sister got the wrong bag!" I was like... o great that's just wonderful. So I had to give him my room key and everything so he could get his stuff. It was just one big mess and I was cranky to begin with so that was pretty much that. I stayed mad at him the whole night and well.. we pretty much avoided each other at the last dance. He imed me a couple days after I had gotten home and stuff so we talked and yadda yadda. I didn't stay mad, the whole situation was just to stupid to stay mad, lol.   We don't talk all that often anymore, but I did remember his birthday. I sent him a necklace I had bought at my hometown's ocktoberfest and a card and stuff. I was plotting something though. After he got the first birthday present I sent him this awesome basket of b-day goodies. I guess it must have made an impression. Lol. For Christmas he sent me an angel statue, then I, feeling bad for not sending a Christmas present, sent him a 20$ gift card to Hot Topic.   My birthday came up and he said "No money". So I said- just send and ecard or something. I mean, that's usually what everyone does anyways. So, on my birthday, he sent an ecard. Lol. He was one of the 5 people who actually remembered my birthday to begin with so he was automatically on my good side for that day.   And then this gift came...  30 days after my birthday. I wasn't really expecting it.. other than the fact that arturo had asked for my address a couple of days ago (he lost it.. lol). So that was a little clue. But yeah- it came today in the mail. It's this really awesome painting of well... I'm not sure. But I love it- it has all these hidden faces and things. Plus- it comes from Mexico! How awesome is that? Yea, it's pretty awesome.   ARTURO- THANK YOU, YOUR AWESOME, AND I LOVE YA!  Just wait until your birthday... I'm gonna get you good! Lol.    I leave you with this..... I'm feeling like a million bucks today

      And a new skin too! It's almost too good to be true. But yeah, I decided that the  true  reason I wasn't posting was because I was so sick of looking at that other skin. I mean, I have an extremely sporadic person so sticking with one skin for awhile tends to bore me. I like this skin though- despite the grandma(ish) feel to the background.  Wanna know why?? No? Well your going to hear why I like it anyway.    1. It was easy! This skin was so easy to customize it wasn't funny. 2. The neatness! Everything has it's own place and it's easy to see. 3. Blockquotes! Now I can put my poems, stories, dialogue, and lists in a completely different box!   Special, I know.  Now maybe some of you will leave comments! Maybe I should rephrase that. Now ya'll better leave comments! My life isn't that boring that you can't leave me a tip or two from a day to day basis. And no, I do not pay the person who comments the most :-P.   In other news...  I'm crushing on someone. No, I'm not "crushing" someone. Note the "on". Yea, his name shall remain anonymous for several different reasons which I will not disclose at this time. All you need to know is that I have a thing for him and it's not an internet guy(lol). Although... tim's one friend is really hott.... *shakes out of daze* I can give you clues about this guy- but my guess is that you have no idea who I am talking about (muahahahaha! Thus I have 2 big secrets now.)   1. I have known "of" him for awhile. Try, say, 3 years. 2. He's homeschooled too! (that may have given it away..lol) 3. Goes to the same church I do. 4. Completely sweet guy who is obsessed with cars.   I dunno what it is about him specifically... I just.. kinda like him. Alot. There is one small problem though, I think we both have a shy tick. Well, he may not be shy per say. Just shy around me?? I don't know. My mom seems to think I have a retraction force on guys, or, in other words, I scare the living crap out of them and make them feel like they can't approach me. Now- tell me, how is that possible? Well, she must be right... because lately I have been noticing that guys will just walk around me, sorta waiting for an opportunity for me to look up and acknowledge them. What's up with that?! Maybe I should ducktape my mouth into a smile position.. that away they don't feel so threatened. Good news though- the guy I like did lean out his car window and say bye to me whilst driving away from the church on Sunday. Maybe there is hope for me after all. lol.   So prom...  Yea, It's creeping up quite quickly. I want a date! *chants* I know you can have fun going stag and everything, but I don't want to go stag. Which probably doesn't matter, since, I am too chicken to ask anybody! *buries head in hands* That's all right though, maybe I will get lucky and either A. Overcome my chicken-ness and ask the guy I like, or B. The guy I like will ask me. (unlikely in both cases.) O well. Either way- I still get to make a speech! Woot! One.. which I need to write. Crap! More work! Gaaaaaaaaaaa.   Especially for tim.  I told tim that I would type 100 "woot woot's" so here are 50 tim!   woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot  woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot  woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot  woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot woot     I leave you with this..... it takes a mighty man to copy & paste

      I have not posted, as usual, but then again, what else is new?    My emotions have been on a rollercoaster  So I wasn't really sure what to post. I've been happy one day and depressed the next. Normal teenage life you may say.... hardly. I have so much crap coming down on me it's not even funny. Let me just list some of the stuff I gotta do the next 2 1/2 months.    Prom Promo pic.... yep, It's gonna be in the paper so all ya'll who know me- look for it on April 2nd.  Pagent Interview- Who me? Yea, Apparently someone nominated me so I decided to take a dive. For me it may be more like a plunge.. but hey- there's always hope, right?  Prom. Yea, it's right around the corner. Get this! I get to make a speech! Isn't that awesome? Yea... I thought so too...  Standardized Tests- man those suck. And guess what! Daniel is totally ditching on me this year! Well... not really but, he's not testing at the same school I am... *grrrrr* He was supposed to be there so he could draw attention away from me!  The Secret Thing. Yea there is actually a secret thing. Well... It's a big secret and boy are ya'll gonna be surprised. I may even make a new layout on it just for this blog! Some of ya'll know what it is...but most of you don't so just you wait! Hint: It's gonna take an enormous amount of work.   And that's pretty much my life for the next few months. Not to mention my appointment with an allergy and asthma specialist. All this a sick for 4 months straight. Ya, my life is no fun.    Guess what else I have been doing  Answering the first hate mail for the prom. I was fired up too.... I'm gonna post it so ya'll know exactly how I feel. Feel free to comment.

      What else is new? I didn't purposefully forget to post. It just kinda happened.   The Update:  I have done alot of stuff in the past week and as my good friend arturo informed me, I completely forgot to thank the 5 ppl out of the 20 I know that said happy birthday on my actual birthday. Here is that list. To you people- I love ya'll beyond words.   Party Arty, thanks for the date-in-a-box. We had a lovely time on the banana boat. ;-D  Lorraine, thanks for the bday email. It was very thoughtful of you.  Tim, thanks for the emoticon party.... hehe.   David, thanks for the happy birthday. Sorry to hear about your 15th... that must have sucked.  Ellen, thanks for everything!  Everyone else said it late or didn't say it at all.... which made me so depressed that my mom stayed home from work that day. Thanks for making my 16th suck! But Im over it.    The only other big news I have  I got a hamster! And then it died 3 days later! Isn't that great? I was really starting to get attached to the little guy too.  It was a golden teddy bear hamster and his name was orsinio. I found him stone cold dead in his cage this morning. Im not sure how he died. But I think it had something to do with the bedding I bought. He had it all scrunched up around him and he prolly couldn't breathe. Poor little guy. Well he's in hamster heaven now- as well as being buried in the back yard. My dad felt bad so he bought me another hamster this evening. It's a golden short haired hamster and her name is Midas. Hopefully she will live a bit longer. I don't doubt that she will though- she about shredding the take home box.... and she seems to be pretty active.     So Long, Farewell, Alvetazane(sp?), Goodbye!

       Prom is.... tomorrow.  And I seriously could not be more stressed than I am at this moment. I mean, keeping secrets is hard to do when you want to vent on stress, but- just so you get an idea the stress is like:  Driving off a cliff knowing that the edge is coming up and you can't turn the wheel.  Was that a good enough description? Not that I mind all the work this prom has taken to get off the ground, it's just I'm 16, and, life only gets more stressful from here. A break? Ha! This is real life we are talking about....   Of Course, you out there telling yourself that I should lighten up  I'd love to do that! Why don't you give me a way to lighten up and I'd be happy too. Right now just, let me vent and shutup. You don't have to listen. In fact- why are you still here reading this?    1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  Ok, I'm better. Paper bags tend to help a lot. Remember that. Anyways on with my ranting....    Nails.  Why do we have them anyways? They suck! Well, not literaly. Let me offer up some suggestions as to what they are commonly used for these days.  1.  An Alternative Food Source.   2.  10 Deadly Weapons   3.  A Useful Pick   4.  A Handy Wedge  And that's only a few. Whenever you are born nobody sticks a tape recording to your ear that repeats "Do Not Chew Your Freaking Nails, Moron" endlessly. Why? Well, for one it might be degrading. And two- that would be a mirror of the book  Brave New World , which I will not summarize simply because it can't be.    So what's the big deal?  Why do people have to have their nails 6 inches long and looking like a chrome plate? I mean, they are not only a national threat but they distract you with their shiny-ness as well. I, on the other hand, have .02 inch long nails and they would'nt crack a peel on a banana. (Crack- a peel? Yea weird analogy...just live with it.)    Besides my nails...  I..I... have nothing else to complain about really. I mean I could get into gruesome detail on everything but, I think I will spare the 2 solid readers that I have. Love you guys!    Without further ado I give you........ nothing at all.

      I was trying on my prom dress and shoes today. I had to use the strapless bra, which, agitated me so much it wasn't funny. I looked pretty good- I was shocked. You see- Im not a dress person. I will do whatever is possible to never be seen in a dress. But it was different with this dress. I felt like a princess, and trust me, I AM NOT A PRINCESS. I'm actually, quite far from. I'm a tom-boy. Lol. And no, that is not code for I am lesbian- so just shove it.    I'm so excited!!  I really can't wait. I just wish someone was here in hickville with me that day ;-D. You know who you are :-P. Btw- Everyone expect pictures in may. I will be sending them!   Now for some lyrics  I love this song!! So I had to post it!   I'm not a perfect person There's many things I wish I didn't do But I continue learning I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I'm sorry that I hurt you It's something I must live with everyday And all the pain I put you through I wish that I could take it all away And be the one who catches all your tears That's why I need you to hear  I've found a resaon for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you And the reason is you  I'm not a perfect person I never meant to do those things to you And so I have to say before I go That I just want you to know  I've found a reason for me To change who I used to be A reason to start over new And the reason is you  I've found a reason to show A side of me you didn't know A reason for all that I do And the reason is you   You know that you love me... so- just tell me!

      It's lyric time. This is Away from the Sun by 3 Doors Down  It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  Can anyone tell what I've done  I missed the life  I missed the colours of the world  Can anyone tell where I am   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun again  Away from the sun again   I'm over this  I'm tired of living in the dark  Can anyone see me down here  The feeling's gone  There's nothing left to lift me up  Back into the world I've known   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again   It's down to this  I've got to make this life make sense  And now I can't do what I've done   And now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me   'Cause now again I've found myself  So far down, away from the sun  That shines into the darkest place  I'm so far down, away from the sun  That shines the life away from me  To find my way back into the arms  That care about the ones like me  I'm so far down, away from the sun again

      I can't even get my bold tags in without having to pay for the premium! I can't spell check until I get... the premium! I can't make it look pretty unless I get the premium! I hate xanga! To the blogger people: I love you. Blogger is 10 times better than xanga.   Ok, other than that.  I went outside into the bright sunshine yesterday. It was.. relaxing. I got away from the computer screen for at least 4 hours, which is a miracle of no small proportions. Going outside was a bit inconvienent, seeing as I was having my first burst of creative design since... o, three months ago. That's all right though, I needed to work on a tan anyways.    And now it's time for a "secret" update   Secret Number 1: It's only 2 weeks and 3 days away! Ya'll are going to be sooo surprised.   Secret Number 2: So, I haven't quite talked to mystery man, but, maybe I'll get too sometime soon. Secret Number 3: Muahahahaha you'll never find out who my next year's Prom date is. I have only told.. 2 ppl. muahahaha.   Heehummhoo  Anyways, like I said earlier, I was working on a new blogskin last night. It's pretty spiffy. It's called Technicolor Grunge. Weird name? Yea, but it's a really awesome skin. I was just messing around with gradients and spikes and stuff so I decided to just make a skin. It shall be revealed either today or tomorrow so look for it on Blogskins or my design site.   I leave you with this... can a chicken cross a road?

      Yea, so I haven't updated in awhile. I figured I should since carmen actually blogged for the first time in months a couple of days ago. Uh, with that in mind....   It's a post!  I have a coupla things I can update ya'll on. My life was once again hectic this week, and if you don't know why- then come forward and let me smack the crap out of you! The biggest stress-ant at the moment is of course the Prom. I decided to ask a friend to come along, but, tres sad, he couldn't make it because of "family buisness". What? Yea, I didn't really understand either, but that's aight. I got a prom date for next year the same night the dude I asked said he couldn't make it. What? Lol, yea, it was pretty awesome if I say so myself. I betcha'll will never guess who it is...  And that puts my secret count up to 3  3 secrets all at once, man, aren't I just the lil sneaky one? Muahahaha. I wield the power of the secrets. Now, down to buisness.   I was supposed to write a song.  About california tim's car. Which I haven't started writing yet. Carmen will like that lol. She feels that she is the gifted one. Well- I give her props, because, she is gifted. But, I'm talented too.. so we shall see. Look for that song, and her's, cause I am gonna post them both on here one day soon....

       Introducing: The Human Pincushion!  No thematic music for this one. You may ask- "Where is this human pincushion?" Well, let me direct your attention to... myself.   You see....  Today I had to go see the Allergist. No, he is not someone who causes allergies. He's the person that tells you if you have allergies or not. How does this man accomplish such a feat? Well- he gets his nurse to plunge about 24 needles in your back, and 9 needles in your arm. Painful? O sure. But what is pain when you need to find out that you are allergic to hickory tree pollen? Nothing I say, nothing. Ha- if only pain were nothing. Maybe then I wouldn't have screamed out in sheer agony at the doctors office today. The arm needles I could handle- but when they plunge a clump of six needles into your back then it's over. It's like living the julius cesar scenario, only skipping out on the "et tu brutus". I am not exaggerating! It hurt! It hurt alot! Not to mention, now I have all these little bumps all over my back that itch. Their are a couple of bumps on my arm, but they are hardly noticeable because of the pen marks that designated where the needle met my skin. Grotesque? You know it. But I think I may live. If I don't die of over-itch.   So anyways- Im on allergy meds and stuff  Which, really wasn't all that different than before. They said my breathing was good, and that I seemed to be getting enough oxygen to my vital organs (thats questionible though) all that was wrong is this stupid cough, and the fact that I am not getting any sleep.   Yea, so, no sleep is really affecting me.  I been really cranky and all. I'm hoping that they get me some stuff that will help me sleep too. That away- I sleep! And, Im not cranky! Because perky people don't like cranky people. And- well... I think my parents are sick of me being cranky too. I'm even sick of me being cranky! It sucks! In the 3rd degree. I'll be ok though. Eventually.    I leave you with this....I have a hamster named Midas

      Why? Because I said so that's why! Geeze, you need an explantion for everything. No, actually, I am going to talk about something that gives every guy a rash... (unless, he's a pervert, in which case....nevermind.) Today's episode:    Mind over Bra   Now, I am sure that you are wondering why the heck I would be talking about bra's in a blog entry. Well, it goes like this;   Today, I was out shopping for prom crap. I already have my dress, the shoes, and the purse. But, as my mom so keenly pointed out, I needed a strapless bra.  Just thinking about regular bras makes me cringe. You see, I am a tomboyish kinda girl and I don't do the whole... wire.. and.. pads.. thing. I tend to stick to sports bras because, well, they are comfortable and... they are comfortable. Don't get me wrong, I own regular bras and all. I just don't wear them all that often.   So today I was out shopping...  And I come across a nice looking strapless. I take it to the dressing room (which, was surrounded by guys) and try it out.  After battling with the hooks to try to get it to close, I took a look-see in the mirror. It was like:   OMG! I have boobs!  Something that I must have completely missed out on having before. I didn't like it. So I changed back into normal clothes and went to find my mom. She says:  It's only one night, I'm sure you won't die.  Gee thanks mom, so reassuring.   So I bought the "strapless slingshot"  Was I happy about this?? No! Of course not! But I had to have it for my prom dress. (erg)    Ahem, so anyways.  I went shopping today, and here is what I bought:  1. A new bandana 2. A new shirt (old navy...) 3. New flops. (sandals..) 4. Some makeup  And that's all I have to post for the day. Ciao.    I leave you with this......old navy rocks!

      Where nothing quite exciting happens and all you can think about is this one person who you can't get out of your head! Ack! I don't understand it all. I promised myself that I wouldn't do this kinda stuff to myself and well, it just happened. Before all ya'll go out there and get a big head thinking I'm talking about you, don't. I'm thinking about my crush person. Yeah, that guy. I was going to wait around to talk to him at church last night but my parents wanted to go home so, I never got to say hi. In fact, it happens like that almost every week. I think I might actually have to trip right in front of him or something to get that speaking opportunity. I'm making a resolution:   I, Meghan, will speak to my crush on Sunday morning.  Now that I've said it, I can't go back on it right? Right. Here is the list of things I plan to do to either, A. Get his attention, or ultimately B. Get him to talk to me!  1. Smile. A lot: After all- smiling is like the universal friendliness gesture. 2. Get and Hold eye contact: My mom seems to think that's where I lose them at. I don't usually like to look at people for too long because I'm afraid they will see something they won't like. Or worse, something they do like. 3. Make small talk: Ok, I suck at small talk. Not afraid to admit that one. Which is really funny because I could talk forever, and then some. I know he likes cars... so... *mental note: I will remember to speak of cars.* 4. Give him some contact info: Yea, it may sound forward. But a little email never hurt anybody did it? Ok, well there was the occastion where people get a virus in their email but that is completely beside the point.  Ok, so I think I have it down. All I need now, is, what I like to call, "The Moves".   "The Moves"  What exactly are the moves?? I mean, I'm not your normal chick. I'm a social rebel. I don't mingle, I don't chase after guys, and I do not have the suave techniques to catch a guys attention. Sure, I remember every guy's birthday, give them a card and all. But I mean, do guys really like that stuff?? I don't know. I usually just do it to see the shocked look on their face. So, I don't have "The Moves." I'll have to compensate with my dashing wit and my bedazzling intelligence. *mental note: wear cute clothes*   And now the final question: Will it work???  Well, If I had any clue at all if it was going to work than do you think I would have posted it here?? No! Well, according to becca, yes. She thinks I am a blog-addict. But I'm not! I swear I'm not! Ok, maybe I am just a little bit. But that doesn't mean anything! All it means is that I like to rant about my life! It's a hobby, ok? So there.    I leave you with this.....Clean-up on aisle 2!

      Well, I knew that this time eventually had to come. Even though I have tried to put it to the back of my mind for 9 months. That's right- Meghan is off to work again on Tuesday. I am so overjoyed as you can probably tell... erm..(insert cough here)  So, I thought I would warn the two steady readers of this blog to be prepared- there will be tremendous amounts of complaining on here as soon as tomorrow rolls around. It's not that I hate working, it's just that, I hate working.  Yeah, I'm keeping it short and sweet today.    When all else fails, look to the north and hope that Aragorn comes riding atop that hill to save thy behind.

      Write a post! That's right, another post written out of sheer boredom. Only, this one has a funny topic. It's; "How to crack a walnut without the use of a nutcracker".   To crack a walnut, you must be sneaky... Not all walnuts have the same shell-smashing withstanding capacity (sswc to be short). To test this capacity, lightly tap the walnut on the desk to see if minimal pressure produces any crackage. If it does, than your in luck! You may be able to crack the walnut in under five minutes. If the walnut fails to produce even the littlest of cracks, I would recommend that you move on to step two; that is, to lodge the walnut in between your desk drawer and your desk.   Shoving forcefully with your palm upwards, begin to drum the drawer into the desk. Hopefully, this action will cause your walnut to begin cracking and/or to crack completely!  (Watch out for flying pieces of walnut shells. I recommend you wear protective goggles at this point.)  Sadly, this procedure has been known to fail. If you find yourself at a breaking point, and have only cracked a total of two walnut shells in the past 30 minutes, I suggest that you move on to step three.  Look around you- are there any "mini-crow bars" nearby? If so, begin to wedge the edges of the walnut open slowly. I think you will find the mini-crow bars to be very effective. When unable to wedge the walnut open gently, change your method slightly to incorporate large amounts of pounding. That usually does the trick.   WARNING: Walnuts contain small pieces that are a choking hazard for people of all ages. Make sure to completely chew your walnut before swallowing.   Wasn't that an awesome tutorial? I mean, not even the "Dummy's Guide to Dummy's Guides" could come up with something as good as that one. Really though, I have to thank Arturo for the inspiration. He was the one, after all, who was having problems with walnuts last night.    I leave you with this... "You raise my satisfaction with life up to ten times it's original height only to send it hurdling back down again, where it implodes upon impact. You then pour water on it and do you know what's left? A hot steaming pile of cold black ashes."

      That's right- the school year is almost over for me. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and it's not a train! So far, I have gotten all my finals done. I didn't do too bad either, which quite frankly shocked me. Here's the lineup of my final scores: Vocabulary: 100% AP American History: 85% Algebra II: 90% English: 92% Physics: 89% I only have one more final left, and that is my lit final. It's on   Breakfast of Champions , which, is to say the least, a disturbing book. I get five essay questions and I get to choose the three that I want to answer. So.. after my lit final tomorrow- I AM DONE FOR THE SUMMER! Woot! I am sad to say, that I will miss this year. It was an ok year. Next year however, is going to be a nightmare. S.A.T's, A.C.T's, P.S.A.T's, G.E.D, you name it I'm taking it. So, needless to say, I may be looking and acting like a zombie next school year. Which really blows, seeing as I finally have some courses that I actually want to take coming up this school year. Let me outline for you: English B Advanced Literature AP World History Trig & Stats Principles of Molecular Virology Design of Expierements Genetics Does that sound a little heavy?? Lol.. I'll be ok, I love at least 4 of those classes so, I'll be ok.  So, I know some of ya'll are wondering about what I'm doing for the summer, and here it is. I'm working my butt off most of the summer, and I'm not going anywhere. I'll be here all summer long so if you want to hang out, just gimme a call and I will see what I can do. Sound's like an exciting summer eh? Well, it hasn't even started yet. Hopefully I can go see a concert or two.. maybe go out a couple of times, redye my hair. The possiblilites are endless. I may even start a story entitled "The Chronicles of TICTM". You know you would read it...  To end this post, I will simply state:   Do you know the muffin man?

If you could read minds, would you enjoy knowing what people were thinking, or would breaching their privacy bother you? Would you consider it a burden to know everyone's innermost thoughts?  Ahh blackmail material.... Actually, yes it would bother me.   3. Do you think you could survive in the Middle Ages?  I could adapt yeah. But if you see a picture of a girl drawing a picture of a cell phone in the sand you will know that I got there...   4. If you knew as a little kid what you know now, what one situation would you choose to do differently?  I would choose to keep all my real friends instead of settling with the crap friends I have had in the past 3 years. (This does not include most ppl, so don't have a cow...)   5. If you were given the choice to know exactly when, how, and where you would die, would you choose to know?  And if you did choose to know, would you try and cheat death? I would be like "Tell me, tell me" and then I'd be like "Nah, I was just playing.."   6. If you got pregnant (guys, just play along) before you were ready, what would you do? Would you ask your parents for help, or keep it from them?  I don't play with my life like that. I know what I want to do with my life and I'm not going to get pregnant until Im done. I don't want my kids to grow up thinking that I don't love them because I didn't get to finish my life. It's not a cool thing to do.   7. Do you think you would enjoy being the opposite sex for the rest of your life? Being a dude for the rest of my life?!  Ugh.. I love dudes.. but I could not be them.   8. If someone came up with an elixir that made you immortal, would you take it? If you would, what would you do with all the extra time? if you wouldn't, well, why not?  I wouldn't because you would have to see everyone that you loved, die. And everyone that you will come to love, will die, And so your ultimately alone for the rest of you immortal life.   9. Does the thought of being a vampire appeal to or disgust you?  I already get my daily dose of iron yo.   10. If you were given magical powers to do just one thing, what would you do (besides giving yourself unlimited magickal powers)?  One thing? I think I would make someone smile. I'd make sure there was no more hurt in their life ever again.    11. If you could go back into history and change one thing only, what would you change? What do you think the repercussions of the change will be?  I wouldn't be able to change it. I would know that.. even if I tried, something would happen so it either happened or something equally as bad happend to compensate.  Well, that was informing wasn't it?? I hope this answers all of anyone's questions. If you have anymore just let me know.    I don't mind spending everyday, out on your corner in the pouring rain.

      That's right, I think I need to give a little love to Sneaky Jim in this post for finding the Kerry bumper stickers. You see, me and SJ just so happen to hate kerry with a passion. Why? Because he sucks. His political campaign is just one big joke. Granted, he does deserve some credit for running at all, but really, do we need another clinton in office? Kerry says one thing, than changes it, and even then, decides to do something completely different from the original two.  If I were 18 this coming voting round, I would definately vote for Bush. Granted, Bush has had some rough times in the white house these past years, but he was still definately the man we needed to get us through these post 911 years. It's with this statement I end my post: "I got nothing but love for the Bush".  Anti-Kerry Pins:  urlLink Pin 1   urlLink Pin 2

      Here's the 411 on my weekend.  Overall, it was pretty cool. The BBQ sucked slightly since we got rained out and half the people that were supposed to show up, didn't. But Ricky, Abby, Alesia, and Tabitha all still made it. I laughed a lot. Pop even came out of my nose at one point in the evening. It was great.  And then, Alesia asks me if I heard what this one chick had apparently been telling people about me. Now, I knew this girl had some problems with stretching the truth, but never did I think that she was capable of bold faced lies. Needless to say, I was more than a little ticked. I didn't deserve that... and I definately didn't need to hear it. I have learned my lesson once again: Never make 2-faced friends. It never works out.  Other than that whole ordeal, I had an awesome weekend. Tabitha stayed the night friday, and we went shopping with brittany on saturday. We had tons o' fun and I don't think we actually bought anything... except for tabitha- she bought belly button rings at Hot Topic.  Yea- so sorry about the boring-ness of the post. I promise the next few won't be as boring. In fact, I'm going to post something I stole from Sneaky Jim next...    I'll leave you with this, Once burned, always burned, Once Burned, Always Burning. How's that for meaningful conversation? Don't ever talk to me again. I will not answer (You know who you are.) .

      Today is the day of the BBQ and I couldn't be more scatter-brained. I mean, I have to clean, cook, come up with meaningless chatter to entertain with. (I.E It's sunny today... hey that reminds me of this one time when I was.......) Don't get me wrong, I can create meaningless chatter with the best of them, but when it comes to large crowds and thus a large amount of meaningless chatter, I seem to feel whipped. So, in order to help myself create meaningless chatter I have decided to blog, since that's what I usually put on here anyways. You know what...  I changed my mind, I'm going to continue the bucky saga today. We last left bucky thinking about stealing sir sparrow's mom's green bean casserole recipe. He was hoping to take it to Mr. Roo, who was ancient and couldn't remember anything anyways, and give it to him so he could complete his quest.   Bucky toyed with the idea of stealing Mrs. Sparrow's green bean casserole recipe. He thought, "If only I could see what the real green bean casserole looked like than maybe I could compare the two and take a calculated risk." Bucky was hesitant, because he knew that, although Mr. Roo was ancient he could still take bucky in like two seconds. The deliberation was killing bucky, so he finally just decided to steal the casserole. "The ol' kook won't know the difference.", Bucky told himself. Little did Bucky know that Mrs. Sparrow was not from the Earth's moon, but, from one of Saturn's moons. The green bean casserole recipe from Saturn's moon is much different than that of the Earth's moon, for the green bean casserole from Saturn's moon has no green beans at all!  Thinking highly of himself, Bucky approached Mrs. Sparrow. "Mrs. Sparrow- I was just wondering if I could get some of that delicious green bean casserole to go.", Bucky said, "What do you think this is?? A Drive Through?!", replyed Mrs. Sparrow. Bucky only nodded for they were at a drive-through. It was called "Mrs. Sparrow's Eats to Go". "Than why did you ask to get my green bean casserole to go if you were already in the drive-through??", Mrs. Sparrow questioned. She was very suspicious, almost to the point of where she could have discovered bucky's plan and sent him flying towards the safe haven of the camen islands. But Bucky was clever, he only replyed, "Mrs. Sparrow, I have money this time." Mrs. Sparrow immediately got the green bean casserole and apologized for her temporary insanity.  Ok, so it wasn't as inspirational as some of the other Bucky tales, but I'm a little rusty on Bucky. Stay tuned for the next episode, where Bucky actually tries to give Mr. Roo the Saturn moon green bean casserole.    Hip Hip for da Chimmeys!

      As you all may know or not know, I am addicted not only to this blog, but also, to the internet (did you hear that faint scream and see a woman faint dead away? No? Well that was an awesome movie..). Anyways back to the subject.  I am addicted to the internet. I don't just surf and chat. I mess with web design, I chat in aim, msn, and yahoo, I blog constantly, I surf, I email. So, maybe you can understand this deep conversation I had with my friend Lorraine earlier (note: this has been edited to fit into the space allotted.):  Me:  Blogger is all shiny and awesome now...  Me:  it's like xanga only you don't have to pay for it!  Me:  plus.. you can audio blog too  Lorraine:  meghan you amaze me  Lorraine:  Lol  Me:  I amaze myself. I think the weird you were looking for was "freak" or.. "weird" or... even... "You freaking weird nerd-dork!"  Me:  or..  Me:  word..  Me:  *cough*  Me:  let me retype that.  Me:  I amaze myself. I think the word you were looking for was "freak" or.. "weird" or... even... "You freaking weird nerd-dork!"  Lorraine:  you just surprise me with your knowledge of things like that among other things  Lorraine:  when your day revovles mostly around insipid conversations  Lorraine:  you get surprised by more meaningful ones  Me:  *blinks*  Me:  Wow, that was deep.  Me:  lol.  Me:  and yes- I do get surprised by meaningful conversations.  Lorraine:  lol  Lorraine:  yes...things like that come out sometimes  Me:  And when they do... woah buddy... someone, somewhere is definitely cringing with almost indefinable terror...  Lorraine:  lol more than likely if I ever said something like that to people I'm around they would just give me a blank look  Lorraine:  don't know if that would be better or worse  Me:  Lol  Me:  I would crack up  Me:  and then say "I been vacationing with the Dali- don't mind my zen reasoning"  Me:  and then that would get an even blanker look  Me:  and perhaps a "Who's Dali??"  Lorraine:  omg  Lorraine:  lol  Yea, so maybe the Dali-zen reasoning reference was faulty, but I mean, if someone has to ask who the Dali is than are they really going to know what zen reasoning is? I bet you 5 bucks they don't give a flying monkey poo about either. That's just how it is these days. We are kids- we aren't supposed to care about anything. We're just supposed to have fun and explore ourselves and make mistakes that we should learn from . I can't tell you how many times I have opened my mouth and speak, only to leave some poor adult in the dust. They call it "disrespectful". Well, gotta give some to earn some, buddy. How bout' a little love for the kids who work their butt's off only to be told that they are completely worthless at everything. Granted, a lot of kids could care less. But I do care. Some say that when you choose your path, your choosing all the stipulations of it too. I say- instead of making excuses for finding reasons to cut someone down, take a step back, and take a good long look at yourself. Are you perfect? No. Did you make mistakes? Sure. So what gives you the right to judge somebody? Seriously, that's God's job. Not yours.  Does this have a direction? Not particularly. Want to guess why?   Because nobody cares..   Now, you may be saying "How very manic depressive of you Meghan." Maybe. Or maybe, I'm just flushing my mind. Kurt Vonnegut did it in  Breakfast of Champions , granted, he did it in a completely different manner. And his flushings were actually published in paperback. Mine- well, they are temporarily suspended in an internet browser.  Hehe, I realize that some of you want to shove a sock in my mouth and tape it shut right about now, and I would probably offer no resistance, but, somewhere, someone will read my blog and have the inspiration to use too many commas. Or perhaps even, just maybe, write about TICTM.    I leave you with this... Neo killed my cell.

      Ok, so the title has nothing to do with the entry. I was just trying to come up with a good hook to get all you weird people to read this entry. Am I strange? Why, yes I am. Do I deny this fact? Not at all. Would I let you call me strange in public? Not unless your name was Tabitha. So- now that that is cleared up I am moving on to a greater subject.  The Man with the Wounded Leg   I was sitting in Church today, and I saw this guy (not a bad looking guy..) with an injury on his left leg. It looked like a giant rug burn. It was so grotesque yet, I was intrigued. I spent the whole hour and a half thinking of why this dude's left leg had this enormous injury on it. Some of the stuff I came up with was simple. Like, for example, maybe he was a marine, and the injury came from this bloody scuff out in the far reaches of Afghanistan. I mean, that was possible. More possible than some of the stuff I came up with. Like, he was really a secret service agent and the injury came about because a mission went completely wrong and he was suspended from a 15 yard cable above these incredible black spikes. The cable snapped, sending him plummeting to his almost certain death, when out of no where at all, this British double agent swoops in and catches him. Not in time however, for the man with the left uninjured leg would now scrape his leg on the very last spike, crying out in terrified pain and anguish.   So, that obviously wasn't the case, but still, I think you can see what an over-active imagination I have. It's not that I don't try to pay attention, it's just that I can't help but think about these things whenever my mind is triggered. What triggers my mind? Everything! I could be staring at grass and come up with some seriously weird stuff! It's not that I am some freak, it's just that, I...I... have an overactive imagination! Some say that I should want to be a writer, not a scientist. And the other people, well, let's just say they are jealous.   Granted, my english skills suck, but someone somewhere has to give me props for being creative. It's not every day you meet a sarcastic, sadistic, creative person. Today must be your lucky day. That or, you have tripped upon my gold mine of useless knowledge and are questioning my sanity. Well, here's a thought: Leave me a comment. You know you want too.  What does this all amount too? Nothing actually. Absolutely nothing. That's why I have a blog. So I can write enormous amounts of words and never actually say  anything at all . It's a marvelous thing. Especially when it is 12:12 in the morning and you have absolutely nothing to do.    And then there were no more complaints.

      For all of you out there who actually got that reference, props for you. I bet you can't even guess what this post is about. No, it is not about rewording 80's songs. It's about....    Meghan's Blog Addiction    Are you scared yet? Well you should be. Why? Cause I said so!  My Blog addiction all started back in March of 2003. It was a boring day, that friday, like, every other day in my world. I was chatting along with an old friend from camp about how the rules for that next summer were going to suck majorly. She, was the one who introduced me to Blogger. What evil would this bring about?? If only you knew...  In the earliest stages of my blogging days, I was lazy. I did not blog very often, sometimes even less than once a month (is your mouth agape yet?). I did not appreciate blogger as I should have. Blogger, is an awesome tool where you can voice you complaints over the WWW without so much as even having to worry about proper grammar or correct spelling. It connects so many and yet so few, with loosely tied blog rings and occastionally a firey post about Bush and how he's out to destroy the world with the aid of the republican war party (Which is a total lie by the way...).   How is it that I, Meghan, got sucked into all the hoopla that is crappy writing published in the blink of an eye? Well, the story goes, I like to write. I suck at writing, but I like to write. Sure, I can occasionally crack out a funny story or two, but generally if you look at my work carefully than you will find these common errors:  1. Overuse of the comma. 2. Cracked Pronoun-Subject referral. 3. 50 or more mis-spelled words. 4. To many (...). 5. Heaps of Slang. 6. Loads upon loads of incorrect idioms. 7. And sometimes, I forget to add words that are crucial to the sentence (gasp!)  Ok, so I'm human right. I don't deny that fact. But really- why do I still write to this thing if I suck at writing?! If your searching yourself for an answer right now, and then come up with one, I dare you to post it in my comments.    Anyways  Yea I am done with my "Deep Thought" for the day. Onward towards the awesomeness!   What exactly is the awesomeness?  Tabitha got a blog! Woohoo! And she mentions my name in the very first entry. Awww.. tabitha I am touched! I love you so much! Hehe. Hip Hip for da Chimmy's!    And then I was like woaaaaaahhhhh... And then I flew out the door.

      Seriously, what else could I be doing other than blogging? I mean, come on, everyone blogs at 12:26. Pshhhhh.  This entry was a last resort. Why? Because I'm a freaking dork and talked the life right out of my cell phone. Is it possible? Yes, it is. I was talking to tabitha, and well, me and her can really chat it up sometimes (which is kinda funny cause we really don't talk all that much. Even her dad thinks that our calls are completely worthless. Meh, what does he know?? Me and tab are the coolest dorks ever to chat it up on a cell phone.). Right, well anyways, back to the story.  So me and tabitha were chatting about 80's movies and Keanu Reeves was one of the actors that was simultaneously injected into the conversation. I was like "Too bad he's gay" and she's like, "Dude! He is not gay!"  And then it happened.   First it was a flicker, then a beep, and then silence. I desperately grasped my phone and pushed every button on it's silverish face plate. Sadly, and to my despair,  it had died.   But it didn't just die, it   DIED  . I mean, not even a defribulator could bring that thing back to life. I was crushed. And so I blogged.  But now I must go, for the mother is calling my name (well, more like yelling for me to get off the computer...).

      I'm feeling a lack of creative-ness today (I know some of you gasped just then, but never fear!) so I decided to steal this (um.. exercise?) from Sneaky Jim.   It's called, Spell your name with band names. Special, no? Anyways, onward towards the spelling of my name with band names.   Mars Ill Everyday Sunday Grits Hammertown Anberlin New Anthem  Ok, so that wasn't easy. I had to think reallllly hard for that list. I mean, It's not exactly easy spelling my name with bands.    Anyways  I am bored. I have stuff I can do, like, plan the BBQ.. or I could work on some more web design stuff. Maybe- I could add to the "Ice Cream Truck Man" story. Hmm. Nah.  So, that's about it for this post. I'd like to note that my audio post was just a test.. and, that I don't normally sound like a dork.   Ahem.     I'll leave you with this...would a woodchuck chuck wood if he could?

      What started out as being a weekend where Tabitha comes over and chills with me has now turned into a full-fledged BBQ/Party. I don't mind or anything, in fact...   This is gonna rock! Besides the fact that the people I invited don't really know each other too well. They are coming in groups of two, I mean, so at least they got someone there to hang with if things should get bumpy. But, woah, maybe I should have thought about this before my mom decided I should invite practically everyone that I know.  What the heck have I gotten myself into? Don't get me wrong, I don't want to un-invite people or anything. I love all my friends. The question is; will they mix well?? I don't know. Some of them represent a different time in my life too so.... wow.   I'm going to stop worrying. There's free food, music, and me. If they aren't comfortable then.. Idk. I'm going to have fun. And so will tabitha. Lol. If anything else, we will all be cracking up by the end of the night. Maybe the stars will peak out that night! That would be awesome.   Dude.. I need to buy some citronella candles or... something..

      Once upon a time there was a magical man, with a musical truck, and his name was "The Ice Cream Truck Man".   One and many have sought after "The Ice Cream Truck Man", because of the sugary goodness of the contents hidden inside his musical truck. Few know that "The Ice Cream Truck Man" is only an illusion, concealing the inflated black market of  flavored, frozen water . Inflated black market or no, the public masses still stream out to the curb every sunny afternoon to meet the "Ice Cream Truck Man" and his musical truck.   The "Ice Cream Truck Man", we shall call him TICTM for short, has not one, but two, secret weapons with which he uses to hypnotize the unsuspecting residents of the neighborhood he may be gracing at that moment. The first secret weapon he has is of course, the musical truck, which can be heard from at least 2 miles away (Maybe 3 if your kid has an intrinsic ability to detect mobile sugar). This truck plays it's sing-songish tune as it slowly moves throughout the city, Promising high prices and the sugary goodness of flavored frozen water. Not many can resist the consuming call of the musical truck. TICTM's second weapon is of course, the hard cold product itself;  the flavored frozen water . "What is so amazing about frozen flavored water"- I dare to ask. "It's yummy stupid!", would be the answer of one of the kids down the block. So, basically, TICTM is music, inflation, and yummy (stupid!) flavored frozen water wrapped all into one mobile black market machine. Understandable.  It was because of this mobile, musical, yummy, inflationist black market truck, that my mother and I went driving all over creation yesterday. It was funny really. We wanted flavored frozen water and we were going to get it! So without further beating of the bush, I will now admit, that I, Meghan, have chased an Ice Cream Truck.   It wasn't all the thrill and excitement that ya'll are probably thinking it was, but, we did get our flavored frozen water!

      Archives. Yep, I did a wonderful thing today... I combined 3 of my blogs. Now, you can see the archives from all of my blogs right here on this blog. What does this mean? Well, It means that I will now be posting solely to this blog. It keeps everything nice and organized, as well as hassle-free! Which, I could use right about now.

      That's right, the reasons why, and why for, meghan has not been blogging for the past two weeks. They are all right here, nested nicely in this new template compliments of the new, bubbly, and awesome Blogger.  Enough of the crap speel. Onward ho! Yes, I am now going to explain my blogger absence:  You see, it all started back in march. One day, my parents decided that they were going to buy a house. So we looked and looked and looked and yet, we couldn't find the house that fit the family just right. Until one shiny friday morning when we went looking in a nearby neighborhood with our trusty realtor. We had seen several other houses already that day, including "The House From Green Hell". I am not exaggerating in the least.. This house really was a pain on the eyes. You could even take a blind dog in there and he would yelp out in pain. Needless to say we all were feeing the lost hopelessness of a wandering child. And then,   There it was   The most awesome house anyone could have ever laid eyes on. Well.. awesome for us anyways. We walked through, oo'd and ahh'd, then decided that we were going to bid. We went back and forth for about 3 days with the owner. Now, if you have ever witnessed the house buying process, than you can appreciate the fact that I didn't blog about it. Our whole family was on needles for about 3 months during this whole process. Eventually though, it came out good. Because now, I am sitting in the first house I have ever lived in. It has a beautiful backyard, awesome amounts of space, and, it's ours.  Sure, it's had it's drawbacks. Like moving. That was fun. We had to hire some family friends to help us get everything here. (Thanks Aaron & Zeph! Hummer's aren't bulletproof!) We prolly would have jumped off a cliff if we hadn't had the help. I have battle scars too... I slashed open my palm. I have this magnificent scar there now. Just a note that things as big as houses don't come without a price.   I haven't met any of the neighbors yet, But I'm sure that they are cool people. Right now, I think I'll just focus on settling in.   Note to Carmen: I am sorry that I did not post, but now I am back, so I shall post, and remind you to post :-P.    I leave you with this: I am back!!!

I mean, I knew there were going to be some changes, but never in my wildest dreams had I ever imagined that blogger would be... so... sweet! It combines the best of all webpublishing components and wraps it all up between the B and the R. Seriously guys, nice job.

      Is it possible? Quite. You may be wondering where the conversion kicked in... well.. it was all thanks to my new digital camera. Yes, I am now, a photography dork.   I'm not a great one, but yes, I can still click the shutter button. So, I have created a photoblog so I could store all my awesome pictures and stuffs. Yea, you can find it  urlLink here . O, and there is also a link to it down on the sidebar. Yep, keep scrolling down. It's under "My Photo Blog"  Well, that's really all I have to say for today other than ARTURO WHERE THE HECK ARE YOU! I called you and you weren't home... and... I really wanted to talk to you. *cries* O well, I guess I will try to call you on friday. Email soon ok?! Ok.  >>>>>>> Jomo Out

      I know I haven't posted in awhile, and this time there is a legitimate reason for my blogging absence. Yes, I Meghan, was in fact, studying for the S.A.T II Biology test. It's been educating to say the least, and at most, feels like a review. Some of the stuff covered is new for me so that means I gotta pound it into the back of my head so I can recall it for the S.A.T. You may be thinking, " O gosh golly gee! That sounds like much big fun!" Well, it's not. Anyways, On with the entertaining story of the day:  Stupid Customers.  Now, as most of you know, I happen to work in the fast food industry. Sucky day job yes, but it pays enough to keep me interested. Well, as you may or may not know (from my constant complaining of just about everything) my place of employment has a hard time committing to the realization that a restaurant can not be run on one worker and one manager between the times of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. It is virtually impossible unless you are completely dead (dead in the sense that you have no customers). Well, as luck would have it, I was stuck on a closing shift exactly like the one stated above. Unfortunately, we were far from dead.  Things were going well up until about 8:30. At 8:30 we started to get a wee bit busy in the drive-through. I made sure to tend to all the whims of the crappy drivee's and was distracted from my cleaning.. (I.E Sweeping the Floor) Now, on closing, Manager's have to pull the registers and count the moneys and yadda yadda. So the manager is usually M.I.A for at least 20-30 mins (that's about 7-10 minutes per register). Well, after my micro drive-through rush, I turned around only to find that there were now 5 people in line up front. So, I went to take their orders. The one couple in front wanted 4 donuts and 2 sandwiches. I got the donuts, then I went to make their sandwiches. As they stood there watching me, they noticed that no one came rushing out to save me from the wills and terrors of the late night customers. "Where's your help??" asked the guy. "Your looking at it!" I less-than-cheerfully replied. I was trying to get done in a hurry so I had messed their sandwiches up. They told me just to switch the tops and I did so, got their sandwiches wrapped, and went back up front. By this time, 2 people had already walked away from the line.  I got the next order done fairly quickly because it was only one item, and then I moved on to the next customers.....  (Dun dun dun...)  Everything was going well. I had asked them the all to important question "For here or to go?", and I had gotten most of their items. Well, the lady had asked me for a  strawberry chocolate regular tart . Make no mistake, this is what I heard her say. So I rang her up for exactly that. I had already gotten their money and was reaching for that item and I realized that we were out of strawberry chocolate tarts..So I looked up and asked her if I could get her a regular one instead. She blinked, and then said- " NO, I WANTED THE CHOCOLATE CREME PIE TART " and so I said, "ok". Then I went to reach for a chocolate creme pie tart. She then asks me if I charged her for the strawberry one and I said, "Ma'am they cost the same amount". She starts to get irate and points her finger down at the glass case. She tells me that that certain tart costs 79 cents and says that she wants her money back.   So I call out to my manager and update him on the situation. "This lady ordered this, but really wanted this, and so now she wants a refund of her money. She needs 50 cents back."  The lady then goes off on this whole ordeal about how I didn't give her correct change and how she wanted 60 cents back straight away. My manager re-rang her order only to find out that the chocolate pie tarts were the same price as the strawberry ones, and told her. She shook her head and demanded her 60 cents. The manager tried to explain that she wouldn't get exactly that back because of the eat in tax and still she complained and demanded her 60 cents back.   "I want my money back because that stupid kid rang it up wrong!"  60 cents! OMG! 60 FRIGGIN CENTS! Over 60 cents that lady belittled me in front of the entire store.   I was pissed. And then the night lady walks in and says that the place looks like a mess. WELL I WONDER FRIGGIN WHY! God. People make me sick.  Yea, so that was my story. I was ok until I got up this morning and read my email. Apparently, I have been giving people funny looks. GOOD FREAKING GRIEF PEOPLE! Just leave me alone!  Anyways, this day does end on a good note. I got my paycheck and it was 283$. Woot! I put 70 in the bank, 50 went to tithes, and the rest I used to buy my spiffy new 4.0 megapixel digital camera.   Shopping therapy rocks.  And that concludes my complaining and updating of my life for the day. I hope you enjoyed.

      Have I said how much my life can suck sometimes? Well, I'm saying it again.   My Life Sucks.   It's not that I like to sit around and dwell on it, but my life really does suck. I mean, I just.. I don't fit anywhere in this stupid world. I don't belong in (insert state here). I don't fit with the people, I don't fit with the surroundings. I just, want to live somewhere else. But, I know that wouldn't help cause people are basically the same everywhere. Maybe I could live in a place where people haven't been brainwashed yet. Like some island where all the natives speak a different language and they haven't even heard of the words "cell phone" and "car" and.. "stupid jerk".  It would be awesome.  But then I would miss all of the people that I love here in the states. Which, is a list of about 10. Some of who, I probably couldn't live without. Like, for example, Arturo. Who I love completely and trust more than anyone else I know at the moment. Scary, yes I know. He's just too awesome to not like that way. He probably thinks I'm a wimp and a complete loon.. but..yeah. Props to him for putting up with me on the phone last night.  You see, this whole ordeal came up with this guy (let's call him Jerk), and he put me in a situation that became slightly more uncomfortable than I could deal with. I'm not a confrontational person. I would rather be a fly on the wall than to actually have to deal with someone. That's because I would most likely kill them if I actually got involved. I have a very short temper. Anyways, this Jerk was really starting to piss me off, and as I was leaving I told my mom who it was. She went back inside and told him what she thought of him and I just.. freaked out. I don't think my mom understands how that's going to come down on me. I mean, I don't hate my mom or anything for saying something, but still.. I can just see what is going to come for that. So, I was really upset last night.  I got home and got on the computer so I could email Tim.. and Arturo was on so he imed me and asked what was up. I told him I wasn't in the greatest mental condition and he wanted to know why (naturally..). I told him I didn't really want to explain it online and told him that I was going to cry myself to sleep. I think Arturo must have a soft spot for sad people cause he was like "Wanna talk??". And.. I knew he had to go to bed cause of his art institute thingy so I told him if he was willing to put up with my choking up and stuff then I would call. Lol. I think he didn't really want to talk to me just then but he did anyways. Thanks Arturo. That was awesome of you.  He made me feel better last night.. which was something I needed so that I could fall asleep. Lol, he said- "Who brought the happy? I brought the happy! That's right."  *sigh*  I still need a hug though.  And that's all I have to say for today.

      Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.  Ok, here's the story on "Shift Happens", since everyone has been asking me why I crack up every time I say it, or somebody else says it.   It was a dark, stormy night... I was on crosswalk with the other condiments and the potatoes (ketchup (Frank Lee), honey.dijon (Kale.. lol..), and french.fries (Farf)), and ketchup randomly goes "Yea, you have to hold on to your luggage in an airplane because....Shift Happens." I was cracking up so hard. Lol, and tim could here me on the mic, we were cracking up together. It shouldn't have been all that funny, but since we were all lacking in the sleep department- it was HiLaRiOuS!  Yea, so, I thought we were past it, but apparently we weren't. Yesterday, whilst chatting with my dearest buddy SJ on crosswalk, someone goes "Yea I have never fell into a toilet". And, me, being the awesome witty and truthful person I am, said: "Yea I fell into a toilet once. My little brother had left the seat up.. and.. I didn't see."   Lol- so tim goes... "And when that happened- did you say "Shift Happens" ??  Omg, I was rolling. I fell of my chair I was laughing so hard. Then I felt that sudden urge to go pee... so I did a crotch dance and ran upstairs.   Yea, so that's the story on "Shift Happens". I hope you enjoyed it.   I leave you with this... never toss a cat downwind.

      This is such an awesome song that I had to post the lyrics. It's off of Sanctus Real's new cd called  Fight the Tide . It is.. *squeaks* yea I like it. (Shift Happens.) True love exists, yes, I know this My heart was waiting for you And when we met I felt my chest Pound fast, racing for the chance To know you, to hold you To open up and show you The way it feels when you know...  You are not alone Know that I would fight the tides To be to together When you feel alone Listen to this song To make your heart feel better.  Two hearts entwined, yes, you are mine And I'll be yours forever I've the done the math, I'm less than half We're better off together And I want you here by my side As much as you are on my mind When I'm gone you should know  You are not alone Know that I would fight the tides To be to together When you feel alone Listen to this song To make your heart feel better.  Rainy Mondays feel like Fridays When you're smiling at me I can feel the space Between us collapsing Our love is everlasting.  You are not alone Know that I would fight the tides To be to together When you feel alone Listen to this song To make your heart feel better.  (Listen to this song... let it make your heart feel better)  Omg.. that is just awesome. Why can't anybody ever write a song like that about me? O, that's right.. I'm meant to be alone forever. **CRAP**

      GASP! no really... GASP!  Ok, So I was asked to write something beautiful and moving in my blog by the one and only  Arturo , bah, so here I am posting.   Anyways, my weekend was really crappy. My mom and I got into a fight on Sunday, got shorted on my check Monday, work sucked as always, and- it was just a bad weekend. I ended it out by crying myself to sleep Sunday night. I know everyone thinks that is so pathetic and whatever, well, I don't care! See, if I cared any at all, I wouldn't have posted that information. **Too Late**  Yesterday I was still feeling slightly off my hinge, so I talked to some of my awesome friends and I felt a little better. Talking to Tim was awesome though- I must add, cause we had so much fun talking on mic and cw at the same time. We could speak our minds about certain people without actually typing it. Lol- plus, Tim played an awesome weird al song for me. Twas hilarious! I was cracking up so hard that Tim was cracking up. Lol. It was crazy. O.o I must say-  MARY NGUYEN REPRESENT!   I also talked to Tabitha and Arturo. Tabitha called and asked me if I would go out with Mike.. and I'm just like "What?!" and.. the conversation pretty much went on like that until I said "Maybe if I knew him better and lived over there". She got all quiet and was like.. "DUDE YOU WOULD GO OUT WITH MIKE?!" And I'm just like... omigosh.  Mine and Arturo's conversation was, to say the least, very strange. Lol. But then again, all of our convo's are strange. I was telling him how I had a blacklight, and he says "You should pee on the wall, than it would glow!" I told him- "Dude, I'm not gonna drop mah draws and take a gigantic swoosh at the wall. Besides, I don't even have the equipment to aim for the wall.." He laughed for at least 5 minutes after that one.. and we spent the rest of the conversation trying to get each other to smile and giggle. Don't ask, lol. It's one of those, you'd have to know us personally things.  GASP! And I got to go shopping today! WOOTANNY! I got a wireless keyboard and mouse, new shoes, cds, and a new mouse pad. Twas awesome shopping therapy. Just what I needed.  So- What would I write now Arturo?? I would write that I am happy.. and that, I like being happy.   I leave you with this- Seven Places ROCKS!

      Apparently, many-a-peoples have been getting a kick out of my blog entries lately. Just last night I got to listen to Arturo crack up over the phone while listening to my latest voice post. I never knew I could inspire so much laughter in such a short period of time. It's really, kinda, freaking me out. Granted, I know I can make people laugh. But rarely do they ever actually get my jokes. It's like, I say something off-handly colorful and the person is usually just standing there like "What the flip?". Haha. Yea, I love my super powers of confusion. They keep me out of some really freaking weird situations.  Anyways, I was saying one thing, and then got off topic...  Back to me.  Right, well, I was thinking yesterday, while on the phone with my great friend Arturo (Ladies- he's single and almost god-like! Hahahaha...) and well, I was thinking: What would I do without some of my friends? Granted, most have them have kicked me in the head, but, what about the other ones? I never thought of myself as being reliant on other people before. I am not a conformist or anything as drastic as that. I just... hmm.. never realized how much I loved my friends before. So, this post is to basically thank my friends for being the awesome people that they are. Tabitha: I love you mannnnnnnnnn! Your like my best friend in the whole world. I hope we stay friends for a long time, and I can't wait to visit egypt with you!  Arturo: You are absolutely the greatest guy friend I have ever had. Your just so awesomely funny, smart, and drop dead sexy! (hehehehehe) O.. and how could I forget.. **almost god-like** I love you to pieces and I hope we stay friends.. for.. well.. for a very very  very  long time.  Tim: Ahaaaaaaaaa! Mr. Gusty! They call him Flipper Flipper Faster than Nothing.... lol lol.. I love making fun of John Kerry with you! Also, tim, talking on the mic is fun so long as you stay talking. Indeed-dly-doo. I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! Lol.. and I mean that in the friendly terms... GASP! Stacy's Mom has got it going on!! **smilez** Mojo (heart) SJ. Lol.. gosh- we have so many inside things now it's hard to keep up.  Ritu: Dude.. dude..DUDE! Lol. We had some awesomely great times at camp last summer. And yes, we should live closer. I think almost 75% of my friends live very far away from me. It's hard.. *tear* I wish ya'll lived closer everyday. It's ok though! Cause there's always IM, Email, and yes- CELL PHONES! Lol Lol. Happy Birthday Chica! I hoped you enjoyed your prezzies.  Ricky: I promise I will come to wyandot as soon as I get the chance! O.o someone is turning 16 soon! I hope it's an awesome bday for you. Lol- did you guys like my house?? I personally think it's awesome but ya know..  Becca: My long losted sister! Thanks for finding my chinchilla, *tear* your such an awesome friend. Becca- dude, our road-trip is gonna be so awesome! We can do it on spring break.. and I can drive up there, pick you up, than we can drive all through IL, and pick up my friends, than drive through NC, and SC, pick up carmen and tim, and then we could all head to miami to party with Josh! Ahahaha- That... would be so awesome. Rebel Sheep Fo'ever. For Serious.  Carmen: I have never met anyone who could keep up with my overly-active imagination like you can. Your so awesome and then some. I love ya's like a sister and I hope I get to meet you one day. We can go skating.. or something.. lol.. NO! We can go toliet papering! hahahaha! Yes! It's a plan! I can see it now.. ski masks and citronella candles, and ketchup, and tissues. MUAHA! Yes!  Ellen: Intrinsic ability to detect mobile sugar! Lol Lol. Ellen, you are the most awesome chick I have ever met. We had some awesome times at camp and I hope I see you next summer! I will be the cool and awesome equinox student, and you will be the older and expierenced spectrum student.. Dude- we will so rule CTD. I look forward to it. Lol.  Now, if your name is not in that list above, it does not mean that I completely hate your guts, it's just that maybe we haven't talked in awhile or done anything together. If that's the case you should call me or im me asap and we shall talk and hang out. Then I will add you name to my "awesomest peoples" list.  *Sigh* Time for me to go to work... I shall post- later.

      wtf?? WTF?! (I do mean what the flip btw...)  Why me?? No, seriously... why me?! YARG! Well.. here's the story:   We were at least one person short today..  Which, is not good seeing as we tend to use all peoples allotted to work. Yeah, so, according to the universal law of suckage, the day we are short is the day we get blitzkrieged. People were cranky... workers were cranky, and I have never heard my boss cuss so much in my life. I don't think I have ever heard anyone cuss that much. Lol. It was bad. Work got somewhat easier in the afternoon when business slowed down ever so slightly. I got to clean the sandwich station as my last timmy chore. *Bleh*  I was so upset at one point, someone asked me if I was about to kill someone.. and I was like "Stress comes custom with our uniforms" and they just smiled and walked off. Hmmm.. A smile. Like the only one I got today. YARG! Also, The Pizza Hut GM came in and watched as I made a sandwich over again 3 times for drive-through. After that, I thought regina might reach out and strangle someone at the drive-through.. lol.. So, the Pizza Hut GM, sympathic to our struggle, offered to send over pizza's for lunch. Free of charge. I told her she didn't have too, and she shook her head and said, "You take care of us, we take care of you!" I was like.. "Dude, your so awesome!" And 2 hours later.. there were the pizza's!    *Sigh*  Thank God I only have to work 5 hours sat. and 5 hours sun. I mean, I love that I am going to be getting some awesome checks, but I really need a break from the 8 hour shifts... cause they suck. They suck muffins. Plus, I carry over into two work crews, which, I normally don't like. I mean, I love certain people- in fact, most people. But other people, it's like- Good God! Do Something! Anything! Stock! Clean! But, alas, these people seem hard of hearing. I have experienced it, Katie has experienced it (sadly so too.. poor katie..) and so has just about every other experienced worker at Timmy's. It's a given really. I can't wait till they hire new people. Maybe we'll actually get a good worker out of this round... *cough cough*  Anyways, I got to talk to Arturo last night. I forewarned him of "The Letter" and after that we just talked about camp and stuff- for 2 hours. Lol, it was great. We were gonna try to see who could stay up longer without passing out over the phone, but then my mom came upstairs to go to sleep, and I was like "O Crap! I gotta go!"... haha, so it ended up pretty much in a draw. Which, you know, draws are cool.    I leave you with this... Sledding down a hill on a scanner and in an old crappy skirt is not advisable.

      Ya'll will not believe what I have been through this weekend. One thing after another came up, and I, yes I, was caught right straight smack in the middle where I always seem to get caught. Are you ready for these complaints?! *insert "I don't think your ready for this jelly"* Unfortunately, the complaints are not booty-licious. (ahem, sorry.)  Anyways, my first complaint is this: If a company expects to do a substantial amount of buisness, than why do they hire people they know will cause trouble or that will not work? I mean, hello! What the heck is wrong with that statement?! If not hire people who will work, than train them well and make them work. If they don't like it than they can quit of their own accord. But don't make everyone else pay for something that is the upper management's problem. Seriously guys... let's think long and hard about that one.  Second complaint: Since you seem to only hire duds, at least keep 2 or 3 backups ready so that they can take their place when they get fired (as, they normally do.), so that the expierenced people who have asked for a certain scedule do not leave whenever they're schedule's get changed because of the void left in these fired people's wakes. Please. PLEASE.  Third complaint: All ya'll people, yes, all of ya'll, need to freaking learn some manners. When you see a person rushing around all over the place, do not get angry or upset because they cannot help you in that second. I understand that sometimes, people need to be asked to do their job, but as you can see, most of us don't. So, if your order is like, 10 seconds late, deal with it. We are trying the best we can with the help we have. If your so busy, than why don't you come back later? I mean, it really seems a waste to spend all that time in line for one cup of coffee and then spending all that time yelling at the window person just cause the car in front of them ordered 5 million things. It really does.  Fourth Complaint: God- get a work ethic trend started please! I am sorry that I do not stop working, and I am sorry that I do my job. But it's not my problem that you guys look bad just standing there while I work. Just blame it one me, say "Meghan was working cause she wanted to" that should get people off your back.  Fifth Complaint: When asked to pull around to the backside of the building, please do it.  And, that's all for tonight. I'm sure I'll come up with more by the time summer is over.    I leave thee with this- For here or to go?! Have a great evening.

      Yes. Sadness has swept over the internet valley, as I, Meghan, no longer have the energy or the time to do the carefree things I once did. *SIKE*  I'm just going crazy, that's all. No big surprise on that one eh? Right well, on to my complaining;  Work was completely sucky yesterday. It was only 4 hours, but still. yarg. I did alot of the major Timmy work, like, cleaned out the cap machines, cleaned and stocked the fridges, cleaned period. It was almost surreal really, I mean, who knew Timmy's was hiring people that don't actually work?! Aha! Now there's a good idea. I mean really guys..come on.   Don't get me wrong- a lot of my co-workers are awesome. And most of them actually work.. but then there are those select few who seem to misunderstand what they are actually getting paid for. *sigh* Why can't I be scheduled with Katie, Deep, Matt, Cara, or Caleb all the time?! They work.. and I work.. and it's all good. I would die happy if I were scheduled with them all the time.    To Bad life has a suck factor.  It's like a given, the suck factor. There has to be an equal amount of suck for all good in your life. What they don't tell you is when and where it will rear it's ugly equalization effects. I thought the suck factor wouldn't hit till college.    Boy was I wrong!

      Eh, so I got another  xanga . It seems to be that alot of peoples I know are on xanga and I just couldn't go on being without a xanga anymores. I'm very upset about this, yes, but it could not be helped. If you would like to visit my xanga, it's  urlLink here .   In other Meghan news,  My mom has been working late again and she's really starting to get crabby. Today she was really touchy and stuff about everything and it's only making everybody cranky. I think my dad caught the crank too, so now everybody's yelling and I just want to crawl up in my room and never come out. That would be so much fun. I need to get rid of this headache first though...  Other than my parent's being cranky, everything is good. I don't have to work again until Saturday and tomorrow I have to go with my parents to check out a site for the fund-raiser. Bah. I'm so busy.  Ok so that's about it for now. Not exactly inspired but hey- it was worth the 5 minutes of typing and backspacing.

The only thing I hate is that I haven't talked to Arturo in agesssss and I want to talk to him soon. Hopefully we can get back to talking on a regular basis once ctd is over :-D (lol, Arturo if your reading this I bet you just cringed..hehe).   I got text messaging added to my phone plan! Woot!

      I'm really tired today. I didn't go to bed until like two this morning and I woke up at about 9:45 so I could get ready to go grocery shopping with my dad. So basically put,    I need sleep.   Other than that, I'm good. As I stated above, I went grocery shopping with my dad. I had fun. I saw 3 hott guys and so.. you know.. I was happy. My dad let me drive too! One of the guys I saw smiled at me and started to follow me around. Until he saw my dad.. then he kinda went away. *Tear* Lol. O well he was probably too old anyways.  O, and I forgot to tell you the story. What story?   Well, last night while I was working, two 13-year-old boys tried to hit on me.  It was very strange, and funny. I asked them what they wanted and so they told me, and so I started to get it. They changed their minds about a million times so I just kinda stood there, waiting for a solid answer. The one saw me standing there and he's all like "You have pretty eyes!" and the other elbows him and is like "Man stop flirting with her, she's like five years older than you.." Which technically I was only three, but you know it might as well have been five. So the first kid blushes and he's like "O sorry". Haha. Little dork. They were really short too, about five feet tall or so. So I just smiled and finished their order.  When I got done and started to walk away, the one goes "THANK YOU SO MUCH" and I just stopped, turned around, and said in the sweetest possible voice "It's no problem" and then I winked at him... (Lol Lol..) and he all runs off to tell his friend. They were giggling like two little girls I swear. It was really, really, really funny.  Back to the present...  I'm excited about tomorrow. Tabitha (my bestest friend) is coming over tomorrow and we're going to hang out. I think we're going to see white chicks... or anchorman... idk yet. I know we're seeing a movie though. O, and I'm going to take lots o pics while she's here. I want to take her to timmy hoes so she can meet some of the peoples I work with...and so I can see someone (shhhhhhhh).  And thus concludes today's blog entry.

      Apparently that's the secret phrase. Secret phrase for what? HAHA! I'll never tell!  Anyways, my day was rather uneventful except for the fact that I got to go shopping! Woohoo! I bought a new shirt and a new purse. Now, I'm not really a purse person but I kinda had to much crap to keep sticking it all in my pockets so I really had to get a purse. This doesn't change the boyish-slack figure that I have, it just means that I have a purse. So stop with the jokes already! Geeze.  Yea, so, I got to drive my mom on up to walmart early, where we shopped, and then I drove her back home.   After that time kinda blurred together and the next thing I knew I was at work. Work was a "blast" as always. I got in there today and a lot was already done. I was happy, and then I realized that there wasn't much for me to do. Then I got anxious... and then I started doing really weird stuff, like cleaning inside all the cabinets and in the microwave and such.. Crap I don't normally do unless there is absolutely nothing to do. Kara worked tonight. She was gonna leave early but Keith didn't want her too so she didn't. That made me happy. I was glad Kara stayed.  Righto. Well, that's all I have to post about tonight other than I thought I should let you know that I have 2 new links on here now. They are too my  urlLink photo center  and my  urlLink guestbook . I expect ya'll to visit both, and sign the guestbook. It's the least you could do ;-)

      What's this? No really, I mean- what the heck is this?   Apparently, I mean something to someone.  Coulda fooled me. Seriously. No joke.  Anyhow, I had better explain.   You see, This all started back in.. O.. Let's say April. Around Prom time. Now, for those of you who know me, you know that my parents and I are the coordinators for the Prom that I attended this year. So basically, my life was hectic and yadda yadda. Well, I had trouble finding a prom date cause well... ( I'm a chicken. ) And so I didn't really ask anybody. Well, I asked Aaron, but now that I think about it.. I realized that might have been uncomfortable. Yes, but anyways, I had asked Aaron and was waiting for him to ok with his parents and everything. Whilst I was waiting I was talking to Arturo via AIM and was talking to him about the whole situation. Out of the blue he was like "You know if things don't work out there you could always send me a plane ticket and I'll take you"  Is it possible to choke on your own spit? Because I swore I did just then. I was seriously shocked. Why? Because I did think about asking him. But I didn't think he would go for it. I mean, yea we were awesome friends then and stuff but I still felt kinda weird about the whole idea. Right so anyways on with my story.  Me: Are you serious?  Arturo: Yea. Me: AHH! Me: Why didn't you tell me sooner?! I would have sent the plane ticket agessss ago! Arturo: Are you serious? Me: Yea.  We both decided it was too late for this year, but next year was a definate thing.  It was funny cause, in order to come he would have to stay at my house. Which- is about 366.53 miles away from his. So, naturally we were gonna have to have permission with both of our parents (for obvious reasons, and so forth). I talked to my parents about the situation and they asked me if that was what I wanted and I was like: "Are you kidding?!"  So my parents were cool with it. Actually, I think my mom has been excited ever since I told her. Lol. My mom's a dork.  So the only thing we had to do was get permission from his parents. I was a bit worried since Arty's 8 months younger than me. But he said his parents weren't going to have a problem with him coming. Still... I was worried. I'm a dork. Lol.  My mom & dad sent a letter to his parents stating all the questionary stuff and so we just waited for their response. It took an enormous long time for it to get here. It wasn't his parent's faults though because the mail was running slow or something. Yea. So- I got this today. Or rather, My parents got the letter.  I was getting ready to go somewhere and my mom screamed up the stairs: "Meghan it's here!" And she walked it upstairs so that we could both read it. When she opened it, a check fell out! Lol! It was the money for his prom ticket! Our very first one sold! It was an awesome moment. Then of course we read the letter..   (Arturo I hope ya don't mind this part... I'm not putting the whole letter in here but yeah, this made me feel so awesome that I just had to share it...) The friendship that Meghan shares with Arturo is very sincere in spite of the distance between them. They confide in each other as if they lived on the same block. We would like to let you know that this is the first time we have let Arturo go on a trip by himself. He has never been to a sleep over, but because of the good friendship that he shares with Meghan and because we see that Meghan is such a nice young lady, (for that we congradulate you as parents) we are confident he will be in good hands.  Thank you very much for inviting Arturo to be a part of this special occasion in Meghan's life.  I had to read that about 15 times. I just... I don't know. I felt really super special in that moment. And then "left hand" popped into my head and it kinda disappeared for a minute.  But it came back. I did a happy dance. I couldn't stop smiling. I was like: "omg.. OMG O.M.G! I can't believe Arturo's my prom date!"  It was an awesome feeling. Hehe. Arturo's one of best friends. I'm so stoked about seeing him that weekend. Even if he thinks he's going to get attack by hicks with pitchforks and see millions of acres of cornfields. (Dork.)  I just.. bahhh! I can't stop smiling!

      At this time I would like to present you with a definiton: Main Entry: dra·ma   Pronunciation: 'drä-m&, 'dra- Function: noun 3 a : a state, situation, or series of events involving interesting or intense conflict of forces.  Drama is all around us. There is technically no way of escaping it.  Some people expierence more drama than others. I tend to think that I attract drama. My friends are dramatic, and have their own dramatic situations. Work is dramatic. My family is dramatic. I am dramatic. Drama, Drama, Drama. Will I ever just have a moment where nothing at all is going on in the world that I have to potentionally worry about? There are so many different situations going on at once in my life, that sometimes I think I could just stop right in the middle of cleaning the sandwich station and explode. I would of course write a letter before-hand blaming it all on the egg salad.  So, it's times like this that I like to let my mind wander to other places. Being online is a really good way to get out some of things floating about in my head... for example, my conversation with carmen a bit ago Carmen: i have a life? pfft-- think again Me: Lol... you have more of a life than I do right now Me: Mine consists of Working and Sleeping Me: and studying for SATS Carmen: sleeping is good... SATs: not so good Me: Yea... let me tell you... what fun. Carmen: i'm takin an sat prep class come the school year if that makes you feel any better Me: **shudders** Me: Yea- But are you taking the SAT II Biology or the SAT II Math?? Me: Cause that's what Im studying for. Me: Stupid college entrance boards **kicks the fat guys with clipboards and acceptance stamps** Carmen: *falls over from overload of knowledge* Carmen: whoa. Carmen: that... sucks. Me: Hm, yes, on about 6 levels of suck. Me: we have.... doesn't really suck, slightly sucks, full on sucks, sucks muffins, sucks in the third degree and sucks to the point of a black hole Carmen: but at least you aren't on the level of pink bunnies and junniper lillies suck Me: Well, I wouldn't really know if I was on that level, because people usually are on medication and getting to know the ceiling at that level. Carmen: so be thankful your not on that level... i was on that level once. Carmen: ...good times, good times... Me: lol. Me: I got close to that level once..... I considered faking catatomic-ism Carmen: sweet Me: Yea. Carmen: why didn't you? Me: I thought about how difficult it would have been to pee... Me: and I didn't like the idea of wetting myself (I.E... days of the diaper rash...) Carmen: oo... thats right-- maybe they weren't such good times.  Now, if I were to have a conversation like this out in public, people would give me funny looks and start to think that I was really, and completely  crazy.  There's a concept. How is it that some of the most deep-thinking people in the world are crazy?! Just because they take a different view on things doesn't mean they should be considered a threat. Granted, there are some real nut jobs out there, but still.  Why can't I have conversations like that with people here? BAH! If I could just find one person within ten miles that thinks even remotely as close I as think than I would die a happy, crazed person.  But no, all the crazy people I know and love have to live out of state. That's definately a level five suck. No doubts about it.   "I'll never tell"

         Well, aparentally blogger  has been doing some more tweaking lately. The text box is quite spiffy now. It reminds me a lot of xanga premium's text box. I want to just hug blogger. It's so awesome.       Anyways, on to  my story of the day:     Today, I went to work. Sounds exciting eh? Well, it gets better. I had to work 9-2, which is not so bad, but when you combine that with other contributing factors such as who you work with, how stupid the customers were, and whether or not you were fully stocked, you will usually get how much your day sucks. Let me give you the equation...            Hours worked  x  Customer stupidity  x  Half Stock  x  Crappy Co-workers  =  The Suck Factor of My Day.          Pretty simple eh?  Well, you would think so. To put it lightly- My day sucked. I usually run coffee station but today they put the new Meghan on coffee station (big mistake.. you never stick new people on coffee station.. your asking for trouble). And Rex told me to help Mary in the front. I absolutely abhor front. I hate it I hate it I hate it! When I am at coffee station I don't have to talk to anyone.. I just pour coffee. But when I run front I not only have to talk to people, I have to look at them and get yelled at by them too. It's all too much. I loathe front. LOATHE! There are many disadvantages too working front. Not only do you get yelled at more often, but you also never get anything done! Line's form out of no where whenever you take a minute just to stock something. I remember, I was stocking donuts earlier today and all of the sudden 5 people walked up into the line! I mean, our customers are like sharks. When sharks smell blood your dead meat (literally). Our customers are the same way only, when they smell fresh donuts than your dead meat (literally).         Ok, so, people  have to eat. This is something I understand. And people don't always want to make their food, another something that I understand. But- why can't people just make their own muffins? I mean really... is it worth all the effort to stand in line for 20 minutes just to order a muffin and then yell at the server because that certain type of muffin wasn't there? It's like....      God, I am so sorry that I am not PSYCHIC and that I couldn't PREDICT that you wanted that PARTICULAR muffin at this PARTICULAR time of the day. Can I offer you a different type of muffin? Perhaps our all to famous KISS MY A** Muffin?? And no, we do not accept credit cards as a form of payment......      I mean, It's  like the longer I work the stupider people get. It surprises me how really and truly stupid some people are. For example:    Lady comes through the drive- throught the other day and asks for a banana nut muffin toasted with butter. Now, as many people of normal intelligence know, you cannot toast a muffin. The little muffin crumbs would fall to the bottom of the toaster and catch on fire, possible causing the whole building to go up with it. Katie turned to me and said she couldn't handle that lady so I made sure to pronunciate myself very clearly "MA'AM WE CANNOT TOAST OUR MUFFINS, I CAN HOWEVER, HEAT IT UP IN THE MICROWAVE." She answered back to me like I was the stupid one- "You can't TOAST A MUFFIN?!". I told her to pull around. Anyways, at the window emily goes to hand her muffin out and she looks in the bag, and then hands it back and say's "O, I didn't want a Muffin, I wanted a bagel!" I seriously thought Katie was gonna jump out the drive through window and strangle that lady. We don't even carry banana-nut bagels. God. How can someone be so incredibly stupid?         And people have  the nerve to ask me why Im so uptight all the time. Well, let me tell you, if you were stuck in a room with 5 of my stupid customers for just 5 minutes... I guarantee that you would be uptight too.        Thus concludes my  rantage of the day.         Mojo
