        Sunday Telegraph Leader: Gender games  (Filed: 22/02/2004)   Dora Ratjen, the German finalist in the women's high jump at the 1936 Berlin Olympic, was anatomically more equipped for the pole vault. Twenty years later, "Dora" revealed that he was actually Herman and had been persuaded by the Nazis to pass himself off as a woman.  In future, no such deception may be required. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is to consider allowing transsexuals to compete in women's events without having undergone gender reassignment surgery. Males would simply need to convince a "gender recognition panel" that they were born into the wrong sex.  If one's sexual identity is to be reduced to a question of what one feels oneself to be, it is hard to see what there is to stop the principle being extended to other matters. If a Frenchman felt sufficiently British, for example, he could compete for Britain, and an able-bodied athlete who felt himself to be disabled could win a gold medal at the Paralympics.  The new rules could too easily reduce the Olympics to farce, although precedent suggests that, when men take on the image of women, they begin to perform like women. The IOC would almost certainly have rescinded Ratjen's medal had there been any medal to rescind. In fact, he came fourth.

        urlLink   Sunday Telegraph Letters: On Birth Row   Cherie Blair should look a bit closer to home before criticising the morality of America's use of the death penalty from a Catholic perspective (News, February 8). Has she forgotten that her own husband has voted in the Commons for abortion on demand, abortion up to birth for disabled babies, and the use of the human embryo as a guinea pig in scientific experiments?  Her horror at the possibility of executing the innocent sits uneasily with her husband's enthusiasm for killing the innocent. Has any abortionist ever granted a stay of execution?  I think the scriptural warning to avoid hypocrisy is apt - one should not point out the speck in another's eye while ignoring the plank in one's own eye.

        WE DO MORE TO PROTECT WILD FLOWERS THAN CHILDREN    A week or two ago on a really bitterly cold day when I was in the town centre, I saw a man wearing an overcoat carrying a very young baby in a sling strapped to the front of him. What concerned me was that the baby had absolutely nothing on its legs, feet or head and appeared to be inadequately dressed for such cold weather.  Personally I thought this was negligent. I am not a mother but I do know that babies lose their heat very quickly and since they cannot walk about and generate their own warmth, I would be inclined to wrap a child up well and put a blanket over him/her when sitting in a pushchair.  Because of the nature of my employment, my employers expect me to take child welfare issues seriously and, although I would have thought something like this should be common sense, I thought I would take this opportunity to express my concern more publicly and to appeal to whomsoever it may apply, to make sure you wrap your children up well when you take them out in cold weather, as, sadly, I have noticed on more than one occasion children who seem to be inadequately dressed for the weather.  However, this does not totally surprise me because, even more sadly, we seem to be a generation that tolerates the legalisation of child murder.  I find it really strange that, although there is public outrage whenever innocent young children are murdered or children killed and wounded through war, when it comes to the horrors of abortion and its consequences, there is a deafening silence. I was not born under a cabbage patch myself and, as far as I am aware, nobody else was either. I was loaned two videos: one was about the development of the unborn child in the womb, and the other one was about what happens during an abortion; the first was delightful, the second horrific. How can anyone who has any knowledge about the development of an unborn child not have a conscience about this?  I really cannot see how we can ever hope to prosper as a nation when we are shedding all this innocent blood; I am told about six million abortions have been performed in Britain alone since the 1967 Abortion Act was passed. I have heard it referred to as "Britain's weapon of mass destruction". Are we really any better than Hitler? It seems to me that by ignoring the sanctity of human life from conception we have opened the floodgates to forces of violence and murder in this nation and the current social chaos and disorder as a result. Sadly, there seems to be more protection by law for wild flowers, bats and whales and concern over cattle and sheep than for future generations. I am told that Beethoven with his family history would have been a candidate for abortion. What talent and gifting and future leadership are we killing off? Personally, for conscience sake, as well as for the sake of those who cannot speak up to defend themselves, who have no choice, I find it impossible to remain silent about this issue.

        urlLink Melanie Phillips's Articles :  "Terminating the Parental Role, Daily Mail, 11 February 2004  The poignant, handwritten diary entry in its childish, rounded letters says it all. 'I had my termanation (sic). Then in brackets underneath: (killed my baby).' Through these few words, one can only guess at the turmoil in the mind of this 15 year-old girl as she struggled to come to terms with what she had done. After noting the event in the impersonal jargon used by the professionals who handled her case, she revealed in childishly simple terms how it actually felt to her. Not a 'termination', but killing her baby. Tragic as this was, the really appalling thing was her isolation from her parents. In need of adult guidance and support more than at any time in her life, she had been effectively abandoned to make this decision and cope with its aftermath on her own. For the doctors who dealt with her had not told her parents on the grounds of 'patient confidentiality'. The girl, who was frightened of what they might say, had said she didn't want to tell her mother. So her GP, who took a mere 15 minutes to see her, simply referred her on to the hospital which carried out the abortion. The first her mother knew of what had happened was when she read the entry in her daughter's diary.  What have we come to when a girl barely out of childhood can have an abortion, a procedure with huge physical, emotional and moral ramifications, without the advice and care of her parents because they have been deliberately kept in ignorance of what is happening? Something has surely gone badly wrong not merely with medical ethics but with our society's whole attitude to sexuality, childhood and parenthood.  On every count, this incident illustrates a widespread breakdown of responsibility, care and common-sense. The first thing it shows is how far"

       Sir - Ann Furedi (News, Mar 26) has accused the pro-life lobby of being cruel to women by scaring them into continuing unwanted pregnancies by exaggerating the risks of abortion. Can the chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service really be so ignorant of the law?  Abortion on the grounds of unwanted pregnancy is not allowable under the 1967 Abortion Act. Ms Furedi must also be aware that there is no right to choose, but that the signed consent of two doctors is required to confirm serious grounds under the terms of the Act.  Is it not rather the case that the pro-life argument that the Act would lead to abortion on demand has been shown to be true? At the time of the Act, the pro-life lobby was vilified for suggesting that doctors might be unscrupulous in determining "serious handicap"; now this, too, has been proved to be the case.  One by one, the arguments in favour of the Act are being shown to be flawed. Ms Furedi should admit that we have social abortion in this country, contrary to the law.

       Sir - Non-custodial alternatives to prison fail to prevent crime or address the widespread fear of crime. Your leading article (Mar 26) makes the point well. One of the main reasons for this problem, which is worsening monthly, is the fact that those in charge of the legal system do not understand how criminals really think.  Having spent nearly 40 years listening to them in cells and interview rooms, I know that the only punishment they fear is prison. It is precisely that fear that lies behind two of the most common pretexts used by criminals to avoid custody: "You learn how to commit crime in prison", and "I did it to feed my drugs habit".  Many criminals privately admit that they have no such habit; but it is a good way of getting a probation officer to recommend a non-custodial sentence. All too often, the strategy works. Too many courts fail to realise how smart some criminals are.  However, it is not only ignorance of the criminal mind that results in the failure to protect innocent citizens from crime. It is the lack of courage by the agencies responsible: the Government, the police, the probation service and the judiciary.  The Government refuses to fund a worthwhile prison-building project. The police do not have sufficient numbers to patrol our streets effectively - but two officers can be spared on a quiet road to photograph cars. Too many chief constables prefer to use their resources to trap speeding motorists rather than to combat real crime. Meanwhile, the probation service still views its main task as protecting criminals rather than victims.  The judiciary cannot bring itself to accept increasing public concern and criticism of weak sentencing. The Court of Appeal, in particular, includes many judges who know little about criminals or victims - and this is being noticed by the press and the general public.  Your editorial was quite right: nothing cuts crime more than imprisonment.   From: Keith Matthewman QC, Circuit Judge, 1983-2001, Nottingham

National Pro-life T-shirt Day gives America's pro-life youth the chance to publicly express unwavering support for the sanctity of all human life from fertilization until natural death.

While pro-abortion forces use their free-speech rights to spread propaganda and lies unfettered, pro-lifers' free speech rights are often suppressed. Examples of the bigotry students have faced include:  * Teachers, principals and school administrators have equated pro-life T-shirts to the Nazi swastika or profanity, and have attempted to force students to publicly remove shirts.  * School officials have verbally attacked students and have attempted to suspend students for simply wearing pro-life shirts.  * One student was physically attacked by a convenience store clerk for simply wearing a pro-life shirt while waiting in line.  * Golden Gate bridge police in San Francisco threatened to arrest pro-life students wearing their shirts while crossing the Gol"

        urlLink   Re: Inconsistent views   There appears to be an inconsistency in Dr Rowan Williams's view of salvation. The Archbishop of Canterbury is reported as saying that salvation depends on "a relationship with God", but also that he "did not believe any individual faced the prospect of eternal damnation" (News, July 11).  If by "prospect" is meant absolute certainty, that is correct, since there is the possibility of salvation for anyone right to the end of life (as there was for the penitent thief).  If, however, Dr Williams holds the heresy of universalism (the belief that all without exception will be saved), he cannot reconcile this with the belief that redemption depends on a relationship with God, since many people have no such relationship.  The Archbishop also raises the suggestion of post-mortal penalties for sin that fall short of actual damnation. This concept is not taught by any mainstream denomination other than the Roman Catholic Church, and seems to derive from an inability to accept the full implications of the Atonement, as shown in the words of Christ to the penitent thief: "Today shalt thou be with me in paradise".  From: C M Rogers, Ipswich, Suffolk

I have eaten Kentucky Fried Chicken � not just one portion, but (God forgive me) a mega-bucket. Driving into town, I have strayed into a bus lane. And I do not recycle.'"
