      The way I see it, there is no real karmic justice-- at least not in the way most people expect it to be. Instead of rewards for good things and punishments for bad things, I see it as sort of a way to equal out good and bad things in a person's life.  You see, life is like a rubber band stretched taught between your fingers. Every time something good happens, the rubber band is pulled tighter. For instance, if you have a good day: you spend the day with your crush, you recover from an incurable disease, you become the queen of your own country-- all these merit another yank on the rubber band of your life.   And then, when you start to think that maybe everything will go your way for a change...     SNAP!    All of the positive events break the strained rubber band and it'll come flying back to hit you in the face with as much negative force as it built up with all of the happy goings-on. It'll all come back around with counters to everything pleasant and then some-- come back and hit you right in the eye.  That, my friend, is the rubber band theory.

      "Hold on, Hold on, Don't be scared-- You'll never change what's been and gone.  May your smile Shine on, Don't be scared-- Your destiny may keep you warm.  'Cause all of the stars  Have faded away, Just try not to worry-- You'll see them someday. Take what you need And be on your way, And stop crying your heart out.  Get up, Come on, Why you scared? You'll never change what's been and gone.  'Cause all of the stars Have faded away, Just try not to worry-- You'll see them someday. Take what you need And be on your way, And stop crying your heart out.  Well, all of the stars Are faded away, But try not to worry-- You'll see them someday. Take what you need And be on your way, And stop crying your heart out.   Stop crying your heart out..."    It's all over.

      &nbsp;  I am a coward.   A horrible, snivelling coward. I'm running away as you read this.   Maybe if I were braver... I would have the strength to say...  &nbsp;  I lied.   I admitt it. I lied to you.  I said that nothing was wrong.  But the fact is...  ... something is very wrong....  ... only we can't talk about it. I'm afraid to.   If I speak it aloud, the issue will then become a real, solid  problem--  and problems have to be fixed.   But the thing is, I can't imagine a pain-free solution.   You see, if I speak it aloud...  ... everything just might fall apart...  &nbsp;

      "And everything I said about how messed your head is,  We're cut up and left in bits and pieces on the ground.   And we learn as we age.  Wait for nothing and my body still aches.  And you take 'cause they give,  Though I love you; and my body-- it leaks like a siv.   Take the picture from the wall  When you think that nothing matters.  Take the picture from the frame  And it's a long ways to the floor.  Cut your finger on the edge  'Cause it's sharper than they told you.  Take a leap from out the window  'Cause it's way too far to go through the door...."  Jaws Theme Swimming , Brand New   I'm so damn sick of this. I'm sick of feeling like a bug in a jar. I can't do anything to help myself and there's eyes all around me. Everyone's prodding me, taunting me, pulling off my limbs one by one and laughing while they do it. And all I can do is let it happen because I'm just a stupid, insignficant, sad little girl.  I'm  SICK  OF IT!   HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO  LET YOU KICK ME  BEFORE YOU REALIZE I'M  NOT FIGHTING ?!  I'D RATHER BE  DEAD  THAN SOMEONE'S FUCKING PINCUSHION!!!  I hate everything about my life-- all I can think about are reasons for it ending. Everything dear to me is in so many fucking pieces right now I don't know if I'll ever be able to fix them. Every time I try the people I try so hard to be happy for smack the bits from my hands and stomp on them. I can't make progress because, for some reason, everyone's so damn dead-set against it.  I look to God but He's not answering. I don't know what else to do.  If there was a way to leave everything behind and never return, I'd jump at the chance and not bother to look back. There's no real reason for me to stick around anyways. I realize now that there's nothing for me here except despair, heartache, and fucked up ideals.   Do you hear me? Do you get the message, all you fucking fates burning me like an ant under a magnifying glass??  I give up... it's over... just let me fucking die already...

      "Vacation, need a little sun to break up  All the frustration and turn it into love. Ain't nobody gonna tell us what we're gonna do  Because today It's up to me an' you..." ~ Vacation  by Vitamin C   Finally, after months of back-breaking toil and long hours of insomniac musings, my week of rest has come! Tomorrow I head out to Florida with the rest of my highschool's band members (whee!), and from then until Sunday it'll be nothing but relaxation! Sun tan lotion, sandles, souviners, and plenty of SAND! A week away from bitching mothers and flu-ridden little brothers and angry fathers and all the pressures of school. God, this must be heaven!  This deserves a celebration... though the best I can do right now is delay homework assignments and dance around in my room. Ah well, after all the stress sophmore year has put me through, I deserve a break before everything gets out of control and I snap. My life had been speeding in a downward spiral, drilling me painfully into the ground and weighing me down with 'responsibility.' Christ, adults have no idea how difficult it is to keep all the balls in the air; to them responsibility builds character. Feh, yeah right. Character my ass. All week I tried leaning towards people, indulging in the feminine instincts to find someone to sympathize with my horrible experiences, but found that no one wanted to hear my rants. So, halleluja, thank God for the internet. Blogs are a great way to filter rampant emotions.    It's at times like this when I feel really lonely, lacking a shoulder to lean on. Maybe in Florida I'll feel happy enough to flirt a little. Who knows? I may actually catch someone's eye when I'm down there. That'd be nice. A person needs a comforting hug every once and a while!   On a side note, why do guys act thicker than they really are? I mean, not every dude can be so simple that kicking a bottle into a moving fan would be amusing three times in a row... Then again, maybe they could. Anyways, it usually seems to me that guys with an intelligence over the expected level for men are shunned (there aren't many...) Today I told some jerk that he was shallow, and he had to ask the definition from a friend. The friend replied as if it were totally obvious, "Dude, it's, like, not deep..." Ladies and gentlemen, the Y-Chromosome. Stupid leading the stupid.   Okay, okay, enough ranting. Time to enjoy my vacation as blissfully as possible! Hasn't this been a shorter, more light-hearted blog, overall? Don't expect to many of those.  Adios, amigos, yo escribir cuando tengo tiempo. (Bye, friends, I'll write when I have time)

      "Never take life too seriously, you'll never get out of it alive." ~ Anonymous    If there's one thing I ever hated about myself, it was my uncanny ability to send myself into uncomprehensible nervous breakdowns. Since I first attended school, everything seemed so important, life-stakingly important. Everything was dictated around this, and if things didn't get done, I absolutely freaked. I'd cry, I'd loose sleep, I'd make myself utterly sick worrying. I constantly searched my mind for some kind of solution, and when I found none, I had the closest possible thing to a heartattack. I'm surprised I didn't accidentally give myself an anxiety attack after all that.   I guess this loathed fault comes from my parents; they always stressed the importance of perfection and punctuality. I always had to have strait A's, I could never get in trouble, I had to practice piano for a hour every day, I had to sit up strait and obey my elders, I had to speak politely and never ever talk back. I did what I was told, and I became very obedient. Disgustingly so. I was youthfully naive, and I can't stand to think of myself as their 'prodigy daughter'.   However, it was obviously not in my nature to stay so docile. Eventually, I grew tired --no-- frantic. I was unable to maintain the level of perfection they wanted from me. It was too much for me to handle anymore, but still they pushed. This time, I pushed back. I finally realized that I was weary from all of it, and sure I tried my best but if it wasn't good enough, well, they could just kiss my ass. Deal with it. I am not perfect. I am not an A student. I hate the piano. I speak my mind, whether or not it is appropriate. And I don't always want to do what I'm told.     Teenage rebellion, some may call it. But I see it as finally freeing myself from what would inevitably lead to my demise. Had I remained under their hold much longer, there is no doubt in my mind that I would have snapped. I would have either gone crazy or killed myself, whichever came first, only to escape the madness. It bothers me now that I ever was that way, though I still worry greatly as if I have something to prove.  My parents have realized that they can't expect a prodigy from me anymore, and have let off, putting their hopes and dreams on my little brother. I pity his wretched soul, but am grateful that it is not me they strictly diciplin anymore. The effects of their stern 'caring' still resides within me, though. I cannot go about my life as freely as I want. I want to be carefree, I want to be indifferent, aloof, like a cat. Independant, unaffected and unattatched. I am still tied down to all these problems with my life, so wrapped up in them I can't take the time to be happy. School, the future, everything means too much; it has become far to important to me to simply brush off (despite how desperately I want to).    They say to life isn't hard when you realize you only have to do it once...   Fuck that.  You only have once. Once to do it right. Like I need that kind of pressure. I've found that we're all too busy preparing for the future that we never have any time to enjoy the present. What's the point in living when you only learn to live after you're dead and gone? Before you know it, you're life is spent, and you find yourself 90 years older, alone in a nursing home with every disease known to man PLUS a broken hip, pondering the 'what if's. The worst fate I can think of besides flat out insanity, would be to be haunted by those 'what if's.    What if I never was badgered by my parents? What if I didn't care now? What if when I had the chance I stuck with it? What if I let go? What if...  No one can live like this.  No one should live like this.

      "All day, staring at the ceiling, Making friends with the shadows on my wall. All night, I hear the voices Telling me that I should get some sleep Because tomorrow might be good For something..." ~ Unwell  by Matchbox 20    One thing I've noticed about girls: we are social creatures with a basic need for a pack. We have a certian social order in our herds, a feudal system if you will, but all members of each tribe are brought together with the equally strong need for companionship. We learn our place quickly in our packs, for refusing to obey by the heiarchy could result in expulsion from the group. Deep down, no girl ever wants to be alone, and those who find themselves solitary are usually unhappy. We need the comfort of another's presense, in case something crucial happens or we suddenly devulge in a craving for triple-chocolate-mousse. Why else do girls absolutely  have  to go to the bathroom in pairs?! To make sure that the other doesn't do something stupid or have something awful happen to that person.  There are the obvious leaders, the Alpha(s), maybe not the most outspoken females but retaining a sophisticated and intimidating air; these women guide the others in the direction most appealing. The rest are followers, which can be classified into three groups: the Brazen, the Bitches, and the Bashful. Brazen femmes are usually the voice of the herd, loud and a tad bit eccentric with a comical flair that keeps the rest of the pack attentive. Not quite secure enough to be a leader, but respected equally as much, making the Brazen second in comand.   The Bitches are the groaners of the tribe, feline in their attributes with a sense of aloofness that clearly states that they are there only when interested, and never because they actually  need  the comradship. They laze around in the security of one tribe before galavanting off to find another when one gets too boring for their tastes. These women are usually more assertive, comanding a certian amount of respect while still finding themselves humbled by the Alpha and Brazen. Bitches are third in the social order.   And last but certianly not least, the Bashful. We all know the type: shy, quiet, unargumentitive, with a timidness akin to that of a rabbit or mouse. Too tentative to say anything that might upset anyone, they follow along without much protest, simply enjoying the company in silent contentment. They are the human version of an Omega, the lowest on the list and usually the most abused by the higher-ranking members of the herd, though mostly in good fun, of course.   Do men have this sort of social order?   My friends tell me I pay too close attention to irrelevant details; such as how some people chew their lower lip when their nervous, or how a few people refuse to eat food that's been cross-contaminated (It all goes to the same place anyways, so what's the big deal?). They tell me I should look at the bigger picture. However, I must confess, the thought of seeing only the big picture frightens me. Quite a bit, actually.  I read an Inu-Yasha fanfic today, y'know, one of those online dealies that have the characters of a movie/show/book/game in an alternate universe. This one was quite good, and I found myself hooked... up until the sequal, that is. Poor Inu-Yasha is driven insane by the pressures and responsibilities in his life, going completely beserk and killing everyone! Could this be me?  I find myself sometimes hearing voices, and it frightens me. I know what you're thinking, 'Oh, stop exaggerating, moron, you're imagining things. It's nothing, you're fine.' And this may be true. But they frighten me, sometimes, when they catch me by surprise. They never talk directly to me, they always sound like someone far away, on the radio or from behind a wall. I try to block them out, but they come back, following me as I try to live as if I hear nothing.  I am terrified of going insane. Absolutely mortified, horrified, a complete and utter shivering mass of useless flesh and bones. I don't want to loose my head. I don't want to be taunted by the tricks of the mind, nor do I want to loose that blurry yet existant line between fantasy and reality. Sometimes, concentrating on the little things makes me feel more comfortable, as if the whole world were not as morbid and sadistic as it really is; like they say, ignorence is bliss. I can forget about everything else in 'the big picture' if I focus diligently on something little, the smallest, most insignificant thing I can find, be it a blade of grass or a breeze on the lake.   Seeing the big picture would force me to see the errors with my future, holes in my plans. I fear this more than death itself. To loose one's mind is to loose one's soul. Once insane, you become nothing but a shell of your former self, something I wouldn't wish upon anyone. If I see the world for what it really is, a mental breakdown is inevitable, and so I remain determine to think only about the little things. Take things as they come. Relax. Breathe.   But the voices, they still haunt me. God, what am I supposed to do? I can't tell anyone. No one would believe it, and those who did would think me a maniac. So what choices do I have? Bottled up inside the voices will grow, I'm almost positive, until they consume me and eat away at the darkest resesses of my mind. I will become a shell. An empty shell. But revealing this dark shame would torment me just as much. No one would trust me, no one would listen, no one would be able to look me in the eye without fear in their own.   No one fears me. Not before, not ever. It's impossible.  How much longer, though... how much longer until I can no longer recognize myself, how much longer until butterflies dance in my vision, how much longer do I have to sleep dreamlessly, how much longer?  Pray for me, I fight the demons alone.  "I'm not crazy, I'm just a little unwell. I know right now you can't tell. But stay a while and maybe then you'll see A different side of me..."

      "Call me, call me, Let me know you were there. Call me, call me, I wanna know you still care, Now, won't you come and Ease my mind..." ~  Call me, call me  by Yoko Kanno     I never figured out how rainy days could be so somber. It's almost like every raindrop is a tear for this god-damn dreary world. Maybe it's just me living in a romanticized version of the world, but doesn't it seem like it's harder to smile during days like these? They say that mysterious people love the rain. They dance in it, season their food with it, live their lives like scattered raindrops without reason or care. I wish to be like them.   Shit, every time I talk it's like I'm quoting some cheesy romance novel; big words, naïveté, and self-loathing laced through each sentance. From what I write, people might start thinking I'm some kind of whiney little kid who "can't appreciate the world". Still, it's not like there will be more than a few random people skimming through my list of angsty blogs, so I really shouldn't fuss about it.   Y'know, sometimes I wonder if we're meant to be the people we are. I mean, are rainy days supposed to be gloomy? Are mysterious people always attracted that gloom?  If you passed me on the street, I know that there would be nothing that would strike you. You would walk by without so much as a glance, overlooking my presence because I am part of the blur. If you saw me again, you would not recognize my face. What sort of person am I? An ordinary one. Brownish-black hair, brown eyes, plain face, nothing that would strike anyone as beautiful or breath-taking. Maybe that's why I find myself drawn to the characters of fiction. So unrealistically different, yet utterly beautiful. They can be innocent and seductive at the same time. They can be cool, elegant, and radiant no matter what. They can have windy, wistful smiles that haunt the minds of others and draw suitors to them like moths to a flame.   In fiction, a person can stand out in a crowd without exertion.    Today I went outside. For the first time in a while, I went out on my own accord. It was brisk, and rain drizzled down lightly and condensed on my glasses, but it was a good fresh feeling. I sat out on the porch for a while-- that is, before my mother berated me for being an wierdo and demanded I come inside before catching cold.   Who does that, anyway? I mean, thinking out on the porch in the rain is something you'd expect from an emotionally-faceted character from a movie or book, and makes a person look rather foolish in real life. But I thought I'd try it anyways. And it did make me feel better.   This morning had been especially-- for lack of a better word-- shitty. My alarm went off inconceivably early for a Saturday, leaving me sleep-deprived and ready to bite someone's head off. The reason for this early morning was State Solo and Ensamble. After scrambling at the last minute to get everything in order yesterday, my friends and I decided to play the next morning. So here I was, awake durring the wee-hours of Saturday (which, by all laws of human nature, should NOT exist), and frantically trying to get ready while my brain was still fuzzy with sleep. By the time I finally got there, I had half the household angry with me and my own anger levels rising uncomfortably high.   You'll laugh at me when I tell you the rest: it was all for nothing! Turns out that our accompanist decided not to show, leaving us there STRANDED for an hour and a half. All that bitching only to sit around and wait. The desolation of the rain strikes again.   Also, I was reminded this morning that I hated grocery shopping. My mother dragged me along, to my great despondency, shopping to stock up our house for a week with edible foods.   It isn't so much the store as it is the time it takes. I mean, they have at least a million things in there, over half of which you would never need or use; yet they still fill their shelves to the brim with this worthless crap so that you must rumage through it all to find the stuff you really need. The aisles are either freezing cold or swelteringly hot, and the constant buzzing of elevator music from the speakers above accompanied by the screams of small children is enough to drive a person completely insane. And on a side note, why do parents have the urge to drag their children everywhere?  Well, there's my morning, lain out for you all neat-like and meticulously described. And it rained. I think it's still raining now, though it's hard to tell.     The doves have come back. Every summer for the past three years, a pair of doves have taken it upon themselves to nest in our garage and perch themselves on the telephone wires outside my window. The rain doesn't seem to bother them, I don't think. Pretty little things, delicate and peaceful. Their whole world spins around each other, for I rarely see one without the other. I don't think they know or wonder about the yelling that goes on inside this house, or muse over the war between the U.S. and Iraq, or a million other things. Must be nice to live life with such simplicity. All you need is that other dove, and everything is right. Nothing to worry about, nothing to think about, just enjoy the company of your companion. No need to fret about the rain, we'll just find a nice, dry branch and wait it out. It'll go away eventually.  For animals of such low intelligence, those damn birds seem to know how to live life more contentedly than I.   Maybe one day I'll figure out what it is I want from this wretched world. Until then, sayonara.

      "Once upon a year gone by she saw herself give in. Every time she closed her eyes she saw what could have been. Well, nothing hurts and nothing bleeds when covers tucked in tight. S' funny when the bottom drops how she forgets to fight... to fight...  And it's one more day in paradise..."  Paradise  by *gags* Vanessa Carlton  Friday night. Young people like me should be out and enjoying the freedom of a promissing weekend, not pondering the strange injustices of the world. It's not like I have nothing to do, but the procrastination of what have you gives way to incomprehensible musings that even the great void of the internet can't subside.     I can't quite get it sometimes. I mean, hey, you only get to live once, why not go out and live  normally  for God's sake? Do things a normal teenage girl would do! Date, go to concerts, party, get drunk, go to the movies, loose your virginity, hang out at the local Big Boys with the gang, y'know. That sort of stuff. That's normal.     Hell, if there's one thing I've learned after years on the recieving end of some pretty distinct 'Good-lord-what's-up-with-her' looks, it's that there is no normal. What people expect and what people do are two completely different agendas, my friend. I've come to learn that life is just one huge cliché, many of it's elements completely and uninterestingly predictable. I am a plain person. I sit at home on my computer, I do my homework on time, I eat, sleep, breath normalcy. I am a slave to routine.     However, I force myself to wonder if this is how I'll be spending the rest of my life, an insignificant and undefined span of time in the enormous expanse of eternity. When I'm gone, when everyone I know is gone, will people see my name and wonder about me? Will they ever think of me as a person who once lived, not some face-less phantasom lingering from the past? I can only hope that my miserable existance doesn't go to waste. But how can I do this when I thrive on consistancy? Everything about me has stayed the same for as long as I can remember. Same hair style, same stupid pink bows on my curtians, same cheerful and noisy clothes, even when I look in the mirror I see that my face hasn't changed at all.     I am afraid of what will happen if, no, when everything changes. What happens when I loose the only things keeping me pinned to the earth? It's inevitable, it'll happen. Life does that to a person, spins them around and jerks them up and down until they puke out their guts on the sidewalk. And there's no way to be ready for it.    Sometimes I think I deserve a good verbal spanking for all this thinking I've been doing. I think maybe I'm waiting for someone to come up to me, whack me on the head and scream, "Just let it alone, dipshit!" Poor little Emilee, a prisoner to her own thoughts.     I just wish I knew for sure that all this thinking wasn't making me crazy.     I don't know, I guess it's better than being an airhead without a thought or ounce of brains to occupy the space between your ears. Weighing it in my hands, I can only find that being a tad bit psycho is merely a slight inconvinience whereas being a moron is a humongous hinderence.     Damn, it's gotten late, my thoughts have run away with me again. Buenos noches, mi amigos. Sleep well.

      "Okay, you babes of jazz. Let's make the parties longer. Let's make the skirts shorter. Let's all go to hell in a fast car and keep it hot!" ~  Hot Honey Rag  from Chicago  Hahaha! Thank God for vacations! Thank God for weak-minded fools!   The whole art issue has finally blown over, though a few faculty members still look at me warily from the corner of their eyes as if I'll suddenly leap up and spontaniously combust, taking the entire student body with me... The school wanted me to serve suspension, but thanks to meticulous negotiations by my parents, I'm cursed with only a few visits to a counsler with my parents. Truthfully, that frightens me more than the aspect of suspension.   I hate shrinks.   I had recieved many phone calls asking how things turned out from worried friends, people I never knew actually gave a damn. It was kind of nice to know that they cared so much as to find out my fate.     Today, I went to the dentist to have a filling put in. God, I hate doctors. Them and their needles and foreboding instruments, the nasty rubber flavor of their gloves and the smell of disinfectant. Maybe it's the atmosphere as well, the spotless walls and white tile floors, it's far too perfect to be comfortable.  But I think its the whine of the dentist drill that I hate most. That shrill, eerie drone and the feel of it digging into a molar... I shudder at the thought. Because of the drill the dentist had numbed me, and so the whole left side of my face was numb for numerous hours, durring which I was forced to hold polite conversations with store clerks. Damn the mall, damn it all to hell.   Anyways, onto better and brighter news! New York City, here I come! Yet another musical trip within the span of a month. This time, the ride is with my choir, the Oakland Singers Encore. I've always dreamed of living in an alabaster city such as New York, with their looming skyscrapers and countless residents, the hustle and bustle you can't get in a small town.  I've lived here since I could remember, a plain old suburban girl growing up around the same people. Nothing ever changes in this hick-town, the same ice-cream store on the corner, the same people nextdoor, the same teachers at elementary school. Faces I've seen for years still linger. Quaint houses lined up quietly, blooming with apple blossoms and lilacs in the spring, leaking in the summer, collecting snow in the winter, and leaves in the fall. Everything is so familiar and slow, I can't wait until I see the Big Apple. The fast-pace lifestyle, the rush --I can't even imagine.  It makes me feel like dancing, swinging my hips a little, kicking up my heels and spinning until I can't walk strait. I want to scream out that nothing can touch me, I've finally severed my mind from the heavy ties of wordly things, I simply do not care. And everything is wonderful, even the rain can't bring me down. It was coming down in sheets earlier, overflowing the gutters and creating miniature lakes on our porch.  And so I propose a toast. Drink to every victory in history, for every smile and laugh anyone has ever given. Drink to my own happiness, my own liberated mind.  Cheers.

      "And you can't fight the tears that ain't coming, Or a moment of truth in your lies. When everything feels like the movies, Yeah, you bleed just to know you're alive..." ~  Iris  by the Goo Goo dolls   Troubled. Paranoid. Insane. These are all words I'd use to describe the pathetic quivering mass of flesh that I have become. I... I just don't know anything anymore. My life seems to have pulled from my desperate grasp; the sand continues to fall between my scrambling fingers to be lost somewhere beneath me. This world is full of broken hourglasses. It seems I've finally lost my way.   My frayed nerves have me hearing voices again, muffled but there, mumbling things that only I can hear. They frighten me, they create a schism within me too wide to cross or close. What am I to do when I'm being pulled from all directions? Everything has gotten out of control, my life is not my own. I can't keep up with my classes, and that in itself is a disaster. I want my future to be full of options-- damn good ones, too-- but if I don't get my grades up again, I may never see the paths I need layed before me. But everything is so hard, every test mind-numbingly difficult. Procrastinated homework has piled up on me, stacked high on a brittle foundation and threatening to collapse upon my head, threatening to smother the life from me.   Friends, enemies, it's so hard to keep track of what arguments were my fault. I'm edgy around everyone, especially those I care about-- my closest friends-- I can't keep up with their enthusiastic optimism. People wanting things from me, all these wonderous things that I can no longer give, I have nothing left. I had a feeling I'd been scraping the bottom of the barrel for quite some time now, but I never knew... I never knew this was how empty I was.  For a while, I had one small escape: my art. I could draw whatever I wanted, only to escape for a while into a world where  I  decided the pressures and restrictions. I could vent my pent-up anger, my loneliness, my fear. I basked in the praise I got when people looked over my shoulder to see what I was doing, I loved the attention. It was a way to heal my wounds and build my self-confidence a bit. It was a wonderful release.  But my flaccid fingers couldn't hold it.   Durring the Disney trip, our orchestra pulled the best members of our band and (literally) forced them to attend a clinic  instead  of going to MGM studios. The band was enraged. Furious. Livid. We threw a fit, but hell, there was nothing we could do. We were like a breeze against a brick wall. The administration would not be moved. So, we attended the clinic, and it was downhill after that. The soloist, whom we had the "privilege" of working with, definately had a majorly spiky tree  UP HIS ASS !! The man was a total dick, completely pompus and the whole situation made me sick.  His solo piece,  The Flight of the Bumblebee  had barely any brass; hell, I only had ONE note in the entire song (Keep in mind, we're wasting valuable MGM time at this clinic and the faster we finish the sooner we get to go to MGM). The soloist had tempo problems, but refused to watch the directer, and the directer decided that he didn't care. He'd make us play it over and over again, but with only one note, I never played. It was tedious, and I hated it. We all hated it. Unfortunately, we worked on the same few measures for  FIVE HOURS . The clinic should have been done in an two hours, tops.   In order to vent my rage, as I normally do, I drew pictures. Pictures on the inside of my folder. Pictures that depicted a certian band directer (Stick-figure versions, of course; not up to my usual caliber but anything else would have been far to gory) getting stepped on, squished, cut in half, and set on fire. Harmless, silly doodles that no one should have ever seen. And I wasn't the only participant, a few others had their hand in 'expressing their emmotions' on my folder durring those agonizingly long five hours. After the clinic was over we rushed out, relieved, and I shut the pictures away.... I never expected anyone to find them and read the scrawled labels beneith them.  So, now, I'm facing suspension from school, even expulsion for these half-assed doodles. They think I'd actually attempt to hurt a teacher? I may be on the verge of insanity, but I am not stupid. I've never been in this much trouble. I've been a good student, diligent, quiet, respectful, attentive (usually), and always clean of these sort of messes. I hadn't meant anything by the drawings, I was frustrated and upset and hell, I'm young and stupid, remember? All we of the new generation are, our minds rotted by the evils of television and video games.   Everything has continued in a downward spiral, I'm feeling more alone than ever before.  They even managed to take my art away from me.   This wasn't the first time I had gotten in trouble for artwork of mine. Quite the contrary, actually, but there was only one other time that still rings so clear in my mind. I am ashamed to admit that when I was in kindergarten, I was crudely and cruelly violated by a male classmate. I should not be ashamed --I had done nothing to merit this horror-- but  he  should. The next week, we were assigned to draw a monster, a scary monster, something we were afraid of. My monster had a penis.  Because it was against school rules to draw such things, I was punished. For a while after that, the other children avoided me. What had made me do something as perverted to draw  that ? I refused to say.  Children... even now I'm surprised at the depth of even that simple drawing which no one understood. No one at all. And yet I was punished for it.   My mother called earlier today and promised me that she and my father weren't mad, I wasn't in trouble with them, but their actions belied those words. My father, usually pretty laid back, snaps at me, shouts at me, screams at me. He wanted me to take it seriously, he wanted me to understand what I already understood. I wasn't allowed to speak, because everything I said seemed to make him even angrier. So, I broke down. I cried like I was five years old. I cried like I haven't cried in so long.   It's funny how fast parents forget promises, isn't it?  Lectures. I hate them. Sitting around that beat-up kitchen table, biting my lips nervously and feeling my eyes well up as they berated me over so many smaller things. I had no power in these lectures, my oppinion was always wrong. I cry now as I type these words, I hate feeling so helpless to defend myself. They twist my words, they yell, and I cry some more, until everything is too hysterical to continue and they release me to the comforting confines of my room.  I will recieve one tonight, no doubt, everything is awkward here. I'm walking on eggshells where ever I go, there's no where safe anymore. I'm always at a danger of doing something wrong, saying something wrong, getting myself into trouble. The voices murmer to me.   I have nothing left, they have gripped me and ripped my posessions from my arms, everything I loved, everything I needed, all gone. The world has fallen around my ears, crushing me beneath its massive weight, but this time no one is there to help me. To survive, I must help  myself .  I am afraid. I am alone.  I am broken.

      "The rain of your existance is shining down on me, And the soap suds spread like a disease From the washing machine..." ~  Washing Machine  by Michelle Branch   I cannot find words to possibly describe to you the joy and relaxation Disney brought... nor words to describe the uttor terror and despair. Overall, the trip was a blast; I mean, who wouldn't have fun in the vacation spot of the century, surrounded by all their closest friends and NO PARENTS? It was wonderful, I was able to finally unwind and rest my mind. No problem seems quite so horrible while riding one of the fastest roller coasters in the park.   Maybe that was the problem. Too much fun.  A few students were stupid enough to sneak vodka into the hotels, disguising the alcohol in  Gatoraid  bottles. Well, the first few nights at the hotel, they and a few others (my friends included), got drunk enough to kill several horses and maybe even an ox. It was pathetic. It was disgusting. It was illegal. Of course, they got caught, but the incident completely ruined the joival mood of the whole trip. People were punished accordingly, and there is word that there will be no more trips out of state for Kettering High School. All because of some idiots who felt like getting a high at the happiest place on Earth. Bastards.  Okay, okay, so I'm bitter.    How depressing to come back from the warm recesses of sunny Florida to an icestorm in Michigan. We were lucky, we recieved three snow days due to lack of power. HOWEVER (there's always a downside with me, isn't there?) this means teachers frantically scrambling to catch up with their already hectic scheduals, which means twice as much homework; and with the Disney trip and all, I had plenty to make up already. I've found myself falling dangerously behind, and it frightens me.   Perhaps what frightens me more is the prospect that the word 'fail' doesn't floor me the same way it used to. Sure, I'm  concerned , but devastated? Nah. Procrastination and laziness are part of my character, and bad habits die hard. Like now, for instance, I  could  be catching up on math by figuring out all those sine, cosine, tangents, blah blah blah. But then, I wouldn't have time to write about my procrastination habits now, could I?   Let's see, other happenings...   Last night I went to Mott High School to see their performance of 'The Sound of Music'. And let me tell you, in all honesty, I was completely blown away. The beautiful sets, the wonderful vocal talents of the actors/actresses, the (surprisingly) amazing skills of the orchestra, it was unbelievable. I was a tad bit (maybe more than a tad bit) jealous of it all, for my own high school drama department has little to no funds, creating quite a problem when it comes to performances. We had no backdrops save for one, which we RENTED, not bought; our props were plywood and other odds and ends from home (the plywood pieces fell apart  onstage  durring our closing night); our orchestra was forced to play and resented it, and therefore put forth no effort; and the majority of our actors' vocal talents are close to none. Sad really.  It was very exciting to head out there and see friends for the first time in years, some were acting, some were part of the orchestra, some part of the audience. Even a few of my Kettering buddies also had the intiative to show.   Before the play started, I caught up with old friends from middle school (the gastly pit of Hell, middle school...) and it was in that time that I learned to be coy. I was with a friend in the orchestra, and she introduced me to the play's 'Uncle Max'. Let me just say, that boy was handsom as sin in his suits with charm and a confident, goofy aura, characteristics that always manage to attract my attention. We talked, er, flirted, but what I was surprised about was how I was able to dodge around his hooks (Amy tells me he is quite a player, and I could see why) and keep my cool. That was something I'd never been able to do before, especially when I was partially smitten. I'd always get so flustered, I'd become a stuttering, blushing idiot. But to my complete surprise, I was able to beam at his flattery with a slightly sarcastic smirk.  Never done that before.  I laughed and leaned away when he leaned forward, perhaps trying to back me into a perverbial corner, I answered him with witty comments, I even humored his teasing, though I couldn't help myself from stiftening under his hugs. It was a reflex, I have this paranoia of closed spaces and crowds; and man, was this guy crowding my space!   Still, it made me feel... desired. I've never before felt that males saw me as anything more than a sexless maniquin. A friend at best, never a girlfriend. I don't have the curves, the pretty face, the long, shapely legs that my male-friends tell me are 'hot'. I've always been all bones and angles, skinny and bowlegged with a round Asian face. I've never been hit on, or asked out, or even known of anyone crushing on me. It just never happened, and I learned to never speak of romance in front of the guys.     Despite his rather foggy intentions, I felt rather flattered that he would even look at me and think "Cute girl. Wonder if she's free later."     How embarrassing. No, embarrassing borderlining pathetic; I filled up half of a blog with some story about a guy I met once. Damn, I'm a looser. A freakin' estrogen-high looser.  Oh well. G'night, all you other hopeless romantics. Maybe someday we'll put our faith in love again, ne?

      "I write mostly on hotel paper, Knowing that my thoughts will never leave this room. I'd be out of line telling you leave her, So I'll lie only surrounded by you..."  Hotel Paper  by Michelle Branch  Damn, another huge gap between entries. Sorry again!  Geeze, a lot has happened in the past few weeks, I don't even know where to begin-- Well, for starters, I started drawing people. Not 'real' people, mind you, cartoon/manga-type people. Maybe later I'll get off my lazy ass and scan a picture for everyone to see... I used stick to anthros and furries and weres, but I thought I'd try something new.   An idea for an online manga has been floating around in my head for quite some time now, and I'm trying to perfect my drawing style so I can get some of those ideas down on paper. I've already started creating characters, two are solid and I'm debating a third. This is sort of a mental goal for me, to create some sort of storyline that I can dedicate myself to and not loose interest after a few weeks (should be quite a task). I've had thousands of comics and stories, but absolutely NONE have ever reached completion. Someday I'll pick up a few old ones again, but only after I've finished this project. I'd like it to be an ongoing story, but there are too many holes in the plot at this point, so I'm not even going to bother explaining my ideas now.  Since we're on the topic of art, I'd like to mention that I had been nominated to join NAHS, the National Art Honors Society. I'm honored-- all the best artists in our school have joined, and art colleges look closely at these sort of things. It is this program that might just earn me a scholarship.  However  (There's always a conflict, isn't there?) I still need to take another year of a language and yet another semester of Fucked-Up-Class-From-Hell-- otherwise known as Physical Ed-- to graduate. I hate that class, myself being extremely uncoordinated and unfit. Anyways, with these classes tying down my schedual, I can't take the required art class needed for acceptance into NAHS. It completely grates my frail nerves whenever I think of how forcing us to run laps is more important than learning the subtilties and culture of different art techniques. Unbelievable, idiotic, jack-ass muscle-brained jocks. I smite thee with all the angst and anguished hate  in my soul ...   Lately, I've been seeing Mr. Dawson (my new councler) every other Thursday, and he's been helping me a lot. He's an okay guy, once you get past the initial 'Talk-About-Yourself-So-You-Feel-Comfortable-Spilling-Your-Guts-To-Someone-You-Know-Nothing-About' stage. We can hold real conversations now, and he doesn't patronize. We talk about anything from my own adoption to my hate for politics (President Bush especially); it's nice to be able to talk instead of listen.   I have lots of friends, whom I could tell anything and not worry about having my secrets loose in the school, but I never say anything to them that I wouldn't mind publicized. I don't know, but sometimes I feel paranoid around people, untrusting and wary. Even my friends-- they simply wouldn't understand. I cadn't tell them the things that I fear, the things that I love, the things that are important to me, because they don't get it. They smile and nod and say 'oh, sure, of course', but it never sinks in.  More and more I start to think that there's something wrong with me...   Tonight was our band's Pops Concert. It was a blast, the best combination of jazz, dancing, friends, and bittersweet goodbyes. You see, tonight was our beloved seniors' last concert, and they went out with one hell of a bang! I'm going to miss them, because I had become close to a lot of them over the course of the year. Strange, I had never had any older friends before this, and now it seems that all my friends are upperclassmen. It's nice, but I'm positive that I'm going to be very lonely once senior year rolls around.  Bleh. I hate myself when I'm happy. Have you ever heard anyone committ such a huge contraditiction to human nature in your life? But I can't deny it, I hate the person I turn into when I cut loose. I become a ditz-- a flirty, slow-witted moron who can't keep her mouth shut. I say things I don't mean before I think about it, I do things that I really shouldn't. I become loud and irritating and flippant, the kind of person I usually take pains to avoid (Cruel irony, that's what it is). Tonight was no exception, I pouted when my male friends refused to come out onto the dance floor and begged people I barely knew to dance with me. And for the record, I can't dance worth shit. I am probably the most uncoordinated, two-left-footed person on the face of the Earth. But does that stop me from trying? Hell no! Because Make-an-ass-out-of-herself-Emilee can dance if she damn well feels like it! Arg, I annoy even myself.  Which brings me to my next point: I have discovered that for as many people who like me-- you know, the kinds of friends that would give a good cry at your funeral-- there are twice as many who don't.   It's the kind of person I am that keeps me from being loved by all, the irreversable fact that I am 'strange' and proud of it. It hurts to think that people are merely amused by me, they  tolerate  my goofy-ness. After a while, that same silliness becomes irritating, and suddenly they realize again why they don't like me-- I'm annoying.   And it makes me wonder, is that why I feel so alone sometimes while surrounded by so many people? Is it because those people are only putting up with me until they can't take it anymore? I hate being alone, it makes me long for someone to just hold my hand for a while, bring be back to Earth and pin me there until I can keep myself grounded. It seems that everyone has someone to do that for them, but I missing my own. I can forever watch those closest to me but only with a sad smile, feeling lonely and wishing my hands were held, too.   But everyone's got someone, right? That means that I have someone, I just might not know who at this point. I can only pray they come soon, because I'm floating-- no-- drifting in the stratusphere, a long ways from the ground.

      "Ring around the rosie, Pocket full of posie, Ashes, Ashes,  We all fall down ..." ~ Unknown Author   Wow. Extremely long pause between updates. Sorry about that, but...  I fell in love. Not with a guy, like one would expect, not a living person, but a city-- the city that never sleeps. New York.   "Hey, castle builder, want the moon and nothing less? Work for years then overnight success..." ~ Only In New York  from 'Fairly Modern Millie' (THE BEST MUSICAL EVAH!!!) I swear to God, Gavin Creel is probably one of the best male vocalists I have ever had the pleasure to listen to. Forgive me, but there is nothing on the planet sexier than a man who can sing...  The city was everything I imagined and more. The people were facinating; I felt like an alien, it was a whole new galaxy. They were rude, oblivious, hasty, loud... I spent hours just watching them. They all seemed to blend together despite the flashy clothing and odd hair styles, the city was one living, breathing thing. So many people, all going their own separate way with a mission in mind, millions of water droplets in the ocean. I could spend the rest of my life there, walking the same streets every day until I die, and I don't think I would even make a dent on those alabaster walls, I don't think I'd be recognized by even a quarter of the people I'd see every day.  It was such a rush, such a thrill to grasp, the beauty and awe that anything could be so large and so  alive . I was almost depressed the day we headed home.  Ah, yes, back to the small town of NoWhere'sville. Where all the faces greet you the same way, where the people look at you and  see  you. Maybe it was a temporary dissapointment, but I missed being invisible.   I feel rather empty now days. I try writing, but my words are hollow, no real meaning. I try drawing, but they remain black and white. I've hit a mental wall, and it's aggravating me to no ends. Damn, what I wouldn't give to be able to pick up my coloured pencils and give decent life to my art, what I wouldn't give to be able strum my guitar and find an appealing melody again.     I saw a counsler.  My mom suggested it weeks ago, hoping that we'd be able to mend our broken relationship. Honestly, I think she just wanted another adult to try and talk some sense into me. So, I decided to humor her. I went.  The room smelled like some kind of stale mint, and there was a couch for me to sit and a large Lazyboy chair for Mr. Dawson. There were shelves of children's books, and framed photographs on the wall. I felt afraid, nervous, that the man would analize me and tell me I was crazy or that I was a horrible person. So, I started babbling.  I rambled for about an hour and a half, stopping every fifteen minutes to wait for him to say something. When he didn't, a few minutes of silence would hang thick between us, and I would think:  Fuck, we're paying for every minute I'm in here...  and just like that I'd start up again on some random topic, branching further and further out from whatever I had origionally started talking about.   I did go into detail about some of my relationships with my friends, a little about those with my family, I told this complete stranger how insecure I was about growing up, and about how I felt trapped and abandoned all at the same time. Initially, I felt a great release when it was over.   I had always been a listener. Always a listener. I'd draw pictures while people spilled to me their woes, and I'd nod absently and add the occasional "Hmm" or "I see" or especially "I know what you mean." I'd make up stories similar to theirs, hoping to add a bit of comfort or reassurance to whatever was bothering them.  I am a liar. A terrible, terrible liar.   But I am so good at it.   I can lie nearly flawlessly when I need to, but it has become a habbit. No harmful lies, mind you, just little white lies to get me out of harm's way, or into the limelight. They make me feel guilty, each one ringing in my mind at odd hours, echoing painfully. I hate lying, because every lie, no matter how small, grows. Always.  I fear those lies, because they might drive people away. I want people to love me, to like me, to know me. When someone says they hate me, that I'm a stuck-up bitch with no concience... I lie some more, saying that I don't give a shit and walking around with a 'devil-may-care' attitude... but that's all it is, another lie. I hate for people to hate me. I don't want to be alone. I want to surround myself with people, loud people, quiet people, good people, bad people, people who I can reach out and touch with my own hands. People that know me.   Maybe this means I'm self-centered, an attention grabber. Maybe I crave it. Maybe it's a high like alcohol or pot.  Or maybe I just fear being alone.  But I figure I already am alone, no one knows me, not really. I've woven too many lies into my life that I can't tell what's true anymore. I've toyed with reality and blurred it with my skillful tongue and gullible ears. They think things about me that aren't true. Aren't me.   What about God? What does he think of my lying?   I'm not pessamistic enough to think that there is no supreme being, but I do believe that he doesn't do shit in our normal lives. He's a spectator, merely waiting until we keel over and he can take us to Heaven or Hell or whatever.   Hmph. Karma-coma. I like that. Some author had once feared that one day she would wake up and not be able to move because of all the horrible things she had done in her life, frozen in what she liked to refer to as a Karma-coma. I think maybe I am facing the same fate. I'll wake up one moring and find myself in some sort of paralysis, maybe not waking up at all. Dispite what people tell me, I am not a good person.  There comes a time when we all have to fall. I have seen it. A person's path is always full of holes; eventually he stumbles.   Well, I wanted to send these incoherent thoughts out into the void, where perhaps someone might wander in and read them, maybe learning from my follies. It comforts me that maybe my errors might not be for nothing, and so I sign off for now, wishing you the best of luck for whatever trial you are facing.  Goodnight, dear void.

      "'Cause it's a bittersweet symphony-- that's life, Try to make ends meat, you're a slave to money, then you die..." ~ Bittersweet Symphony , Oasis   Only one word can possibly describe the frantic chaos that has become my life over the past two weeks: Finals.   Yep, that's right. The six end-of-the-year tests that dictate the future of our education. These enormous exams decide what colleges we go to, what jobs we get, the lifestyle we'll have twenty years from now-- basically whether we're successful or not.  Great.  Of course, it doesn't help that my two hardest subjects hang dangerously in the balance of these grades; I'm right on the B-/C+ range in both Math and Science. Failing the finals would bring utter disaster and would initially-- for lack of a better word-- screw my chances of getting into an esteemed college in New York or Japan. For a while now, my greatest fear would be getting fucked up in High School and then having to deal with a crappy life afterwards. I have this immense fear of failing, of falling and never reaching my full potential... what a horrible feeling to wake up everyday and wish with every fiber in your being that you could have just one more chance to prove yourself...  The very thought makes me feel ill...  HOWEVER, as I have mentioned before, I am the world's biggest procrastinator. So have I studied for the Science and Math? Hell no. Probably should, but haven't. I mean, I DO have four  other  finals to worry about, but it seems to me that teachers are never that considerate. I mean, what kind of person would  I  be if I didn't devote my entire life to books and schooling, completely forsaking a normal social life or any free moments of relaxation to study text that I didn't understand in the first place? God, what do people want from me?!  I mean, tell me honestly any of you who can, what does someone planning on going into music and the arts do with 4 years of advanced math/calculus, and 2 years of AP bio? NOTHING! When I'm 30 years old, do you really think I'm going to need to know how to determine the amount of Kilocaleries a common ground squirrel needs to survive each year and how many of those ground squirrels can live in any given area of the forest? Will I really need to know how to work binary and polar functions, how to find the curve of a circle intersected by two lines, blah blahblah BLAH?!  Exactly. I rest my case.  The end is so close, I can almost  touch  it; it's right there in front of me, hindered only by those damn exams. But you know what they say, "Whatever happens, happens." And as much as my frantic-paranoid-valedictorian side objects to that theory, I try my hardest to obide by it. I mean, lay back, relax. The world isn't trying to eat  you alive. So, if I fail, so what? I am determined to go to college and live the life I enjoy, and a few failed finals won't prevent me from doing just that. I bet in thirty years I wont even remember if I took my finals or not.  Besides, life's already in motion. Might as well go along for the ride.   Don't let trivial things ruin your inner peace.  Because whatever happens, happens.   ~Emilee

      "Now I will tell you what I've done for you, Fifty thousand years I've cried. Screaming, deceiving, and bleeding for you, And you still dont' hear me..." ~ Going Under , Evanescence   Words cannot describe the frustration and  anger  that have filled me in the past couple days. Tears are pathetic and don't solve anything, but recently I've been sobbing in what only can be described as 'I'm-So-Frustrated-That-No-One's-Listening-To-Me-But-I-Can't-Do-Anything-About-It' kinda way.   Normally I wish for harm upon myself. But now I can't help but wish for harm upon my family. I don't remember feeling so bitter about anything-- probably because nothing felt as important as what they destroyed.  My parents (I have a few choice four-letter words to describe them, but will refrain from doing so)-- it's not like that don't understand, it's more like they WON'T understand. They don't want to listen and only hear/see whatever the fuck they want to see and ignore whatever facts are right in front of them.   Last night was officially movie night, and so we all sat around the big screen and watched DVDs until the wee hours of the morning. I had my art supplies and such all spread out around me, my favorite lemon ice tea perched on the table with them. My idiot brother, who will remained unnamed even though his lifetime is sure to end soon if  I  have anything to do with it, accidentally knocks over said glass of tea and spills it all over my stuff. He tells me not to worry and that he'd clean it up, and like the fucking ignoramus I am, I believed him. I TRUSTED him to clean up the shit, and when I wake up the next morning I find all of my art supplies are coated with a film of dried, sticky, god damn fucking wads of CRAP!! ALL OF IT, RUINED!! My prisma colored pencils (expensive, god damnit!!), because of the special wax in the lead,  melted  and are completely unsalvagable.   And, of course, when I confront the little bastard about my ruined art supplies, he shrugs and says "Oh well." I tried talking to my parents about it, but they tell me to get over it and that it wasn't a big deal. WASN'T A BIG DEAL? I'll fucking tell you what the hell is a big deal!   Art is one of the most important things in my life, and having my things destroyed like that without so much as a GOD DAMN APOLOGY makes me feel like I've been beaten and robbed. My parents continue to make up exscuses to defend my brother (who does not deserve defending): he didn't see it, he didn't  know . How could he fucking not know? He was the one who knocked over the god damn glass, not me! He should have known and at least TOLD ME! Then we may have been able to simply wipe off the juice, instead of now, where we fucking have to chip it off!  Then, oh, then... my parents try to blame the entire fiasco on ME! My mother said, and I quote "Well, the glass shouldn't have been there." Well, mother  dearest , do tell me where the  fuck  it should have been! On the damn couch? On the floor? NO! It was on the table WHERE GLASSES SHOULD GO!!  Oh, here's another good one, "You should have done something when it happened." Uh, HELLO! It's not MY responsibility to clean up my  brother's  spills. He said he'd clean it up, and he DIDN'T! So now it's suddenly MY fault? God damn, they have a lot of gall trying to blame  this  one on me.  But what REALLY irks me is that I can't get mad. I'm not allowed to yell, or to complain, or to break things; DAMNIT, I CAN'T EVEN SLAM A DOOR WITHOUT GETTING FUCKING YELLED AT! I can't tell what's holding me back... I can imagine myself running through the house and smashing things, anything, I can imagine going outside and tearing down trees. But I can't for the life of me tell what's stopping me. It gets me so frustrated that I can't do anything to show I'm angry. I can't even DRAW anymore because my art supplies are  ruined  and it's supposively MY GOD DAMN FAULT!  They've finally done it, they've taken away my art. They don't even know how important it is to me.  But they don't care.

      "Now I will tell you what I've done for you, Fifty thousand years I've cried. Screaming, deceiving, and bleeding for you, And you still dont' hear me..." ~ Going Under , Evanescence   Words cannot describe the frustration and  anger  that have filled me in the past couple days. Tears are pathetic and don't solve anything, but recently I've been sobbing in what only can be described as 'I'm-So-Frustrated-That-No-One's-Listening-To-Me-But-I-Can't-Do-Anything-About-It' kinda way.   Normally I wish for harm upon myself. But now I can't help but wish for harm upon my family. I don't remember feeling so bitter about anything-- probably because nothing felt as important as what they destroyed.  My parents (I have a few choice four-letter words to describe them, but will refrain from doing so)-- it's not like that don't understand, it's more like they WON'T understand. They don't want to listen and only hear/see whatever the fuck they want to see and ignore whatever facts are right in front of them.   Last night was officially movie night, and so we all sat around the big screen and watched DVDs until the wee hours of the morning. I had my art supplies and such all spread out around me, my favorite lemon ice tea perched on the table with them. My idiot brother, who will remained unnamed even though his lifetime is sure to end soon if  I  have anything to do with it, accidentally knocks over said glass of tea and spills it all over my stuff. He tells me not to worry and that he'd clean it up, and like the fucking ignoramus I am, I believed him. I TRUSTED him to clean up the shit, and when I wake up the next morning I find all of my art supplies are coated with a film of dried, sticky, god damn fucking wads of CRAP!! ALL OF IT, RUINED!! My prisma colored pencils (expensive, god damnit!!), because of the special wax in the lead,  melted  and are completely unsalvagable.   And, of course, when I confront the little bastard about my ruined art supplies, he shrugs and says "Oh well." I tried talking to my parents about it, but they tell me to get over it and that it wasn't a big deal. WASN'T A BIG DEAL? I'll fucking tell you what the hell is a big deal!   Art is one of the most important things in my life, and having my things destroyed like that without so much as a GOD DAMN APOLOGY makes me feel like I've been beaten and robbed. My parents continue to make up exscuses to defend my brother (who does not deserve defending): he didn't see it, he didn't  know . How could he fucking not know? He was the one who knocked over the god damn glass, not me! He should have known and at least TOLD ME! Then we may have been able to simply wipe off the juice, instead of now, where we fucking have to chip it off!  Then, oh, then... my parents try to blame the entire fiasco on ME! My mother said, and I quote "Well, the glass shouldn't have been there." Well, mother  dearest , do tell me where the  fuck  it should have been! On the damn couch? On the floor? NO! It was on the table WHERE GLASSES SHOULD GO!!  Oh, here's another good one, "You should have done something when it happened." Uh, HELLO! It's not MY responsibility to clean up my  brother's  spills. He said he'd clean it up, and he DIDN'T! So now it's suddenly MY fault? God damn, they have a lot of gall trying to blame  this  one on me.  But what REALLY irks me is that I can't get mad. I'm not allowed to yell, or to complain, or to break things; DAMNIT, I CAN'T EVEN SLAM A DOOR WITHOUT GETTING FUCKING YELLED AT! I can't tell what's holding me back... I can imagine myself running through the house and smashing things, anything, I can imagine going outside and tearing down trees. But I can't for the life of me tell what's stopping me. It gets me so frustrated that I can't do anything to show I'm angry. I can't even DRAW anymore because my art supplies are  ruined  and it's supposively MY GOD DAMN FAULT!  They've finally done it, they've taken away my art. They don't even know how important it is to me.  But they don't care.

      "Don't say I'm out of touch With this rampant chaos-- Your reality. I know well what lies beyond my sleeping refuge, The nightmare I built my own world to escape..."  Imaginary  by Evanescence    I feel like such a heel. Here I am, caught up in the violent throws of soap-opera romances in my own life when so many other things are falling precariously out of balance.  My grandmother is dying.   She's been horribly sick for a while, but I-- stupid, vapid me-- pushed that thought to the back of my mind to make room for chemistry and homecoming. I was happily sheltered for the first week of school, and quickly swept away with the highschool drama surrounding me. It sickens me how easily important things like my family's well-being can be forgotten in place of that cute guy in Language Arts... I feel like such a horrible person.  And what's worse-- I don't feel torn up about the looming death. I don't really feel anything concerning it; it's like I'm numb inside and out. My grandpa's death had me mute for over a week, but now, all I want is for life to continue as normal... no stopping for funerals, no stopping for emotional torment, no stopping for anything.   In fact, I do believe the first thought that crossed my mind after hearing "Grandma probably won't live through the weekend" was: Damn, I'm going to have to miss school for a funeral.   But that's so unblelievably selfish of me, and I'm completely disgusted with myself.   Death screws with everything. It's not  a  inconvenience, it's  THE  inconvenience. You loose someone you care about, you have to stop what you're doing to make time to grieve and mourn... and though I know it'd be hell to live forever, it's just as hard to adjust after death. And after I've worked so hard keeping this year molded perfectly to my expectations, something like death comes along and smashes it to bits.  Despite how unorganized and slap-dash I may appear to the rest of the world, I-- like most-- am a creature of habit. I live for routine. I get up every morning at the same time, go to school, come home, get online, do homework, then go to bed. It's a system I've painstakingly set my internal clock to, and I've tried my entire life to get the tiniest elements of that schedual carefully ballanced. And now that it finally is, God once again becomes a sadistic bastard and fucks it all up.  I don't know what to say or who to consult about this... I only have you, my readers, and I'm not sure if even that will help me. I'm not looking for pity, I don't want any "Oh, I'm sorry to hear that"s or "It's not your fault"s or "She was old"s. Because they won't make me feel any better. What I need right now is a hug telling me that I can change from being an awful granddaughter into a caring one before it's too late.

      "I used to get away with so much, Now I can't get away. I even thought that it was simple To say the things I wanted to say..." ~ Find Your Way Back to Me  by my girl, Michelle Branch    Well, sorry for the long pause between updates. Blogger went psyco-crazy on me and wouldn't let me update; it kept giving me some crack-pot error for days and days and days... Anyhoo, lots to catch up on.  First and foremost, BAND CAMP! *ignores the multitude of horrible band jokes that come flooding in* Yes, I, myself, am a marching band junkie, and damn proud. I love the people and hate the marching and love the gigs but hate the music. It's a priceless relationship, I can assure you.  It's so weird growing up, you know? It's like everything you were isn't who you are, and everything you are is so muddled you don't know what it all is until you aren't it anymore... good god, I'm confusing myself. Let me try to simplify that run-on sentance: as you grow you change, but you don't know you've become something new until you've changed again. It's hard to explain, but it's all I got right now. I'm a junior. In high school. God, I'd never have thought I'd make it this far if you'd have asked me five years ago. It seemed like lightyears into the future from that point, and now that I'm here, it's already passing me by.   First, being an upperclassmen/leader sucks. A lot. Not that the freshmen are horrible, but the responsibility and pressure is so enormous it's capable of moving bones. You've got you're MEAP and your SAT/ACTs, you've got scholarships and collage apps., so much shit is going on at once and it all dictates who'll you be. Frankly, it scares the bejesus out of me, but the way I figure it, it'll be over before I can worry about it. And where I'll go from that point on will be a mystery no matter what path I walk.  Band camp really made me think about growing up. Strange, usually it only makes me think about... you know... band. This year, I realized, I only had one more chance after this to make band great. One more year until I'm gone for good. I mean, the majority of my good buddies are seniors this year, and that's it for them. They can't come back, it'll never happen again and they'll spread across the globe and I'll probably never see half of them again (sad as that is). It's like life is finally happening, and I'm finally able to see myself as an adult. I'm only half-way there, after all.   Senior night almost made me cry, and it wasn't even MY senior night. It hurt so bad seeing my friends have their last camp week, and knowing that they won't come back to see mine. It was a hard realization that slapped me in the face that morning. It was almost as if the world paused to say: Wake up, idiot, next year it's your turn. It was difficult to watch, but eventually as the rest of the crowd died away and all that was left were the tight group of friends between under-classmen and seniors, I was able to give hugs and sniffle a bit under my breath. I recieved some of the tightest and most meaningful hugs in the world. It made me want to cry more.  To my seniors Meghan, Courtney, Cody, Emily, Val, Brad, Renee, Mark: I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.  I made lots of new friends; the freshmen are so cool this year. I was even assigned a freshman to mentor-- her name is Maegan and she's a real sweetheart. However, I'm positive I'm not the best role model, but she'll live, right?   I've also developed sort of a weird magnatizm for stalkers. It's scary. They flock to me like nails. For instance, I've known for a while one of my best friend's younger siblings (a freshman this year) had sort of a crush on me (hard to believe, isn't it?). And, being the nice person I am, damnit, I decided to humor him and asked him to dance at one of the extra-activities at camp. I also decided to say yes to anyone that asked (bad move). So, now, I've got a few very annoying underclassmen following me around as if I'd suddenly toss them a bone or something. It's pathetic and I pray to god I was never that irritating as a freshman. If that weren't enough, there was a family having a reunion at the same camp the same week we were there. We met these people last year at camp (damn, some of the guys were cute.), and exchanged names and such, but that was it. No e-mail adresses, no screen names or phone numbers. HOWEVER, they rememberd my name, when I couldn't remember theirs. Or meeting them. It was rather unsettling.   Also, I've discovered I get lonely sometimes, still. I don't have crushes, I'm not in love, but everyone else seems to be, and it makes me sad. There are moments when I completely adored certian people (names omitted for fear of death by embarrassment) and think: I could see myself loving you. However, these feelings always fade and I feel empty again. I hate it. Men suck.   Anyhoo, there's this other thing; I've found that other people think I'm funny. Not always intentionally, but funny none-the-less. They laugh when I'm witty. They laugh when I fall. It's a great feeling, and I like it a lot. In my free time I wrote a list of things I learned at camp. Many of them are inside jokes and the many of you won't understand a wim of these, and they go something like this:   WHAT I LEARNED AT BAND CAMP:  -Triangles/circles suck. -Cameras are the devil. -Lifting stuff can be a wonderful waste of time. -Girls can have just as many hygene problems as guys. -Appreciate sitting. Seriously. -"Couples" aren't dating. -Rain (like triangles and circles) also sucks. -You only really need a half an hour of sleep to keep you going. -Toads are surprisingly easy to squish. -Wet shoes/socks WON'T dry if oyou "just leave them on". -Flinging food will always be fun. -After marching for over 3 hours, any instrument gains five pounds. -You are never too old for naps. -Fooseball  IS  a real sport. -The essential food groups can be purchased for under a dollar. -Don't get Mr. Huntoon mad (You won't like being cold). -Farmer's tans are damn sexy. -Marching fields are fragile. -The line will never be straight enough. -Showers, no matter how disgusting, are GOD. -When you fall, it's funny. -Even if you've seen the same people for the past week, there will always be something new to gossip about. -Australians are cool. -The elevator is always a better option than the stairs. -Your friends won't notice when you steal their stuff until after you turn it into the "Lost and Found". -Highschoolers singing nursery rhymes (especially tone-deaf ones), are always hillarious. -The ceiling/top bunk will always be low enough to bash your head on in the morning. -The gock block is a menace to mankind. -(For the trumpets[or more specifically, Cody]) Holds are harder than you think. -You can fit 4 drills in one of your back pockets. - EVERYBODY RUNS  -Technically, tables are NOT musical instruments. -Standing in front of the snares is like being pelted in the back of the head with tiny rocks. -You'll never remember what color your shoes used to be. -Bugspray is a fine substitute fore perfume (keep poison control on speed dial).    Well, Emily D. got this great idea to sign me up for skit night without my knowlege, and to have me read this list to the entire camp. Of course, skit night rolled around and they called my name and I blanched. They dragged me up kicking and screaming, and it didn't end there. I was nervous enough to piss my pants-- there were way too many eyes.   But they laughed. And they laughed hard.  People even asked for copies of the list.  It makes me feel awsome. I know a few were only doing it to build me up a little after seeing how completely freaked out I was, but it still felt good.   I finally like who I've become. Sometimes I talk to much, sometimes my jokes aren't really funny, and sometimes I do stuff I'm ashamed of, but that's okay. Because I am.   And people like me.  ^_____________^  Thanks guys, all my friends and readers. You guys have made my existance a tad bit more meaningful.

      "SMILE, DAMNIT!" ~ Tiffany (I luv you!)   It figures-- the one point in my life where I've finally found a natural high... and everyone around me is depressed. It's an epidemic, I swear.   I almost feel like I've passed the bad mood onto everyone else; smile, please? Life looks so much better if you just find something insignificantly stupid to laugh at for just a moment. Trust me. ^___^  I guess this is what you call an oddity, isn't it? Emilee? Not depressed and full of teen-angst?   Wonders never cease.  But, for once in my pathetic existance, I feel fine. I'm hovering on a half-full, bright-sided, silver-lined cloud, and I'm determined to enjoy it, no matter how brief the ride. I've found something that makes me want to get up in the morning, a thought that rushes me through school, and ultimately gets me through the day with a smile. I'm so thankful for finding it and being able to hold it close to me when I'm feeling gloomy or nostalgic. It's something I never want to lose, but I'd share it with the world if I could.   It helps not to fret too much about the bigger worries in my life-- tests, home troubles, etc.-- and to appreciate the smaller things, like the hugs I get and what I feel when I make people laugh. It makes things so much easier, and makes the world seem surreal and unimportant.  I can breathe again.  Still, even in my euphoria I feel slightly deflated, mostly because other people that I care about feel so cruddy. I know just how awful and empty depression makes a person feel, and I only wish I could make it better-- but I can't. No act of another could ever rectify the hole a person feels. They have to find something worth smiling about.   Recently, I've been getting much closer to one of my best friends, Meghan L. We've reached some common ground, and she's been my main outlet for more personal matters that I'm unable to discuss on a public site (i.e. BOYZ!). Meghan, you rock, man. Thanks for listening to my pathetic and girlish ramblings.  Not to be maudlin or anything, but I want to wish large quantities of laughter to bless the lives of those I love, and for all of my melancholy buddies to cheer up, if only slightly. I love you all, and I want you to be happy.  Okay, that was a crappy conclusion to this post, but I really have nothing more to say.  ^____^

      "And when we're done soul searchin', When we carry the weight and died for a cause, Is misery made beautiful Right before our eyes? Mercy be revealed, Or blind us where we stand? Will we burn in heaven, Like we do down here?..."  Witness , Sarah McLaghlan  This post goes out to my best buddy in the entire friggin' world, Arynn, and all of you who gave me that extra hug the other day. I really needed the support, and you guys kept me my smile from faltering. I love you all so much.  The few days past, my life has slowed to an eerie crawl-- I physically went through my motions and routines ever so mechanically, but in my mind I sat somewhere isolated, somewhere too far away to touch with anything other than pure will and desperation. Lethargy and depression are two dangerous substances, my friends, and I was riding on the delicious fumes of a deadly hybrid of the two. My world had suddenly become very, very simple: I existed. Purposelessly, I sat and stared with a glazed expression pondering the reasons of my being, finding only more complex questions to escalate my migraine to a new level.   For a miniscule moment in time, I simply wanted to stop existing. Stop being Asian, stop being an artist, stop being a teenager, stop being horrible at math, stop being a music lover-- I wanted to stop  being . Just for a second of my life, I wanted to lay down and close my eyes and never open them again...   Because everything hurt.  Loosing my grandmother was such a horrible experience-- she was such a beautiful person, classy and religious... In nearly one hundred years of existence she had touched so many lives, I can only hope to be part of a meager portion that was her good. Grandma Helen, I miss you.  Home was a wreck, too. Being my father's remaining parent, my grandmother left him orphaned. I've never seen him so upset about anything before, and quite frankly, it scared the shit out of me. He'd get destructive in his depression-- chain-smoking like a chimney, not eating, fluctuating between extreme bursts of anger to stony isolation. It hurt us to see him hurting, and I couldn't do anything to ease that emptiness he felt. I think it was the only time I've ever seen him make my mother cry.  Before any of you jump to false conclusions, he has NOT and would  NEVER  hit anyone. He is a gentle man, and not at all abusive in any way. It was his private grieving that worried us to the point of bitter tears.  The funeral was more than I had imagined, but I think it was just as she would have wanted. It was very proper and followed religious procedures exactly as they were written (despite the boringness of it all), and was all in all very beautiful.  I was even allowed to say a word for her before the final parting. I was able to mumble around my tears how grateful I was to know such a woman, how grateful for such a family, to explain how much I loved every one of them. It was emotionally taxing, but I don't regret any word of it.  Arynn, you showed up and surprised me. But I cannot express how deeply touched I am by that, not with all the words in the world. You truly are an amazing person, Arynn. Your compassion and support were my pillar through the tears and the yelling at home, and I could never repay you for the security you've given me.   To my friends, you showed me you cared, that you were concerned. I've never had that sort of companionship before-- my childhood was pathetically lonely for reasons I can very well understand, so it is no surprise how shocked I was at the number of people asking me if I was or would be okay. I felt important, I felt like I was needed, and  THAT  was my purpose. I have a purpose. I can justify my existence, because my presence is wanted by at least one soul in this world.   That thought alone warmed me until I thought I'd burst with laughter and tears in unbridled happiness.  It is enough for me to feel something good again, something not hollow or false, something I could wrap myself in and fill my essence with its goodness. I've felt joy, contentment, I've felt my first extremely maudlin-high-school-girl crush (there's hope for me yet !)... It's overwhelming, but I can't get enough. I haven't felt this wonderful in eons.  Who cares if the questions aren't answered? I can answer them without words.   Ask me.  Because I'll only tell you  to  smile.

      "Seagull you fly across the horizon Into the misty morning sun. Nobody asks you where you are going, Nobody knows where you're from..."  Seagull  by Bad Company   The week has only just started, and already I know it's going to be unmistakeably BLAH. I don't know if any of you have felt this way before, but it can all be summed up quite easily in a haggard sigh.  It's completely horrible-- I feel like something's sapped all of my energy and good-spirits, I'm on the verge of tears every six seconds. I'm so tired, but no amount of sleep will remedy this condition. I almost feel whiny: My god, life is soooo hard and everyone hates me, I want to become a hermit and never have to come out and look you people in the eye again, blah.  It's  pathetic.   I haven't felt this depressed since freshman year. A good friend of mine had gotten critically sick, and the whole senario had me completely soul-less for about a month. However, this time around I can't think of any reason for my meloncholy mood. I woke up, and bam-- five gajabafillion bad things seemed to hit me all at once.  And from then on, I felt like crawling under a rock and dying.  My family is going through some rough spots; perhaps this is the root of my gloominess. Or maybe it's just that school is gaining momentum and thus sending out more homework. It might be that maybe I'm just lonely, and THAT'S causing me to walk around like a zombie...  God only knows.  But I just feel so weary, and I think it showed.  I felt so lethargic, and I was no where near as outwardly friendly as usual. I drew disturbingly bizzar pictures, and faked every smile. The day wore on agonizingly slow, probably because I basically tried to dissapear from the public's radar by keeping to myself.  However, people wouldn't let me slip away from the animalistic social gathering known as High School without a fight (I love you guys.).  Today, a bunch of my peers seemed to notice a difference in my behavior and were seemingly concerned about my well-being. They offered me hugs (which I desperately needed), and undeserved compliments, and more hugs, and Cody even let me get in a few free pokes (he's hillariously ticklish.).   To all of you out there, I'm deeply touched.   BUT I cannot promise an improvement in my attitude or disposition, as I can't really tell what's wrong with me to begin with. I shall try my best to stay up-beat, but don't expect too much-- I still feel like I've got an empty space somewhere inside me.  Until then, I can only offer you what I have, which I fear may not be enough.

      "I'm high but I'm grounded, I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed, I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby..."  One Hand In My Pocket  by Alanis Morrisette   Today, I found out there's a word that describes people like me-- it's contradictory. I want everything and nothing, I am everything and nothing. I am a walking conflict. I don't even know  what  I am anymore.  It's like there are two halves of me, each screaming for opposite things and craving them like oxygen. I need all of these things I can't have, and I don't want any of them at the same time. I've been tearing myself in a million different directions, and haven't even known I've been doing it.  Ah, now I'm beginning to confuse myself.  What I wouldn't give for a nice trip to a secluded, serene area for a soul-searching journey... My thoughts and feelings are so jumbled up inside of me I can't tell what parts are me and what parts are something else. I want to know again just who exactly I am...  From what little data I have collected thus far, I am eccentric (no surprise.). I'm also bubbly and outgoing, but often annoying and too peppy. I can be cynical, sarcastic and violent with a cruel sense of humor, and I also seem to have a tendency to curse like a sailor quite frequently.   So, in short, I'm cheerful and jaded. A happy pessimist.  Right...  I want to be comforted and supported but I also want to be independent and isolated. I want to live in New York but I want to live in Montana. I never want a family but I don't want to die alone. I want to study art and music and literature and science. I want to be loved but I don't want to love, I want blue skies but I want rain, I want scars but I want to be flawless. I want religion but I want freedom from God, I want all the noise in the world but I want silence, I want to be strong and I want to cry, I want to be dependable but I want to be dependent, I want the world but I want nothing to do with it.  I want these things that I simply can't have, and it depresses me a bit. All this indecision and clashing desires are draining me both emotionally and physically, and I'd love nothing more than to be able to sit down and say: "I want THIS, and nothing else."  I never pegged myself as the masochistic type, but I'm already tearing my spirit to scraps over this. There's just too much I'm scrabbling for with such vigor... what can I do when I can't reach?

      Can you hear The voice of the children? Softly pleading For silence in their shattered world? Angry guns Preach a gospel full of hate, Blood of the innocent On their hands.  Prayer of the Children   9-11-01. I can't really describe what I feel because of that day-- what I feel for America, what I feel for the world.   As I have hinted in some of my other posts, I am not a very patriotic person. In fact, September 11 only strengthened my disgust for red-blooded Americans. Today, because of the anniversary of 9-11, I'd like to reflect on why I lost my faith in people who call themselves Americans. Please, these are my opinions and thoughts; if you disagree, do so to yourself. I don't need any more flames telling me what a horrible person I am for not being so arrogant about what I have.  The youth, being naive to the inner workings and corruption of society, often becomes disgustingly haughty when they feel they've been wronged.  Now, I will not argue that what the terrorists did was a horrible thing, and that no matter of words could justify the innocent lives they took two years ago today. HOWEVER, this is not what lowered my opinion of Americans (I am one, though I do not place myself in this category).   When school came back into session after the attack, rumors were flying like bullets around the halls-- Osama, another crash, families dead, footage of people jumping out of the building... The teachers couldn't stop the overflow of morbid curiosity that we high schoolers had for this tragedy. And so, they let us talk.  They called these discussions Socratic Seminars.  Now, I like to see myself as a very friendly person. I pride myself in the fact that I can get along with/tolerate just about any bastard thrown my way.  HOWEVER, I soon learned that I don't have any tolerance for blatant stupidity.  Our class received an article by some patriotic sadist that we were required to read for this seminar, using the three-paragraph blurb as our "Text Reference". Throughout the article, the author continued to use the word " evil " to describe the terrorists and their actions.   And, to put it simply, that really pissed me off.  I voiced my opinion to my peers: Who are we to judge evil to good? Can anyone, for that matter, pinpoint the right from the wrong? Evil has so many facets to it, can we really just assign that title to someone WE believe is wrong? Just because we may be more privileged and run a more efficient country does not give us rights to decide just and unjust.  I made sure to point out that I didn't mean to justify what the terrorists did, I only meant to amend the horrid arrogance and ignorance of anyone who thought that they knew what was evil. Had they talked to Satan? Had he TOLD them what was evil? Chances are slim to none, so he had no grounds to call anyone evil.  I continued, saying that these terrorists must have had reason for sacrificing their own lives to take a jab at Mighty America, and who's to say that these reasons weren't at least somewhat understandable? It's not like people up and decide one day that they'd like to kill a million innocent people. Perhaps they, like me, were a bit miffed about the mass Westernization that was completely wiping out cultures that have been around for thousands of years. Tribes in the rainforest now use cell phones and computers. The orient now has McDonalds. To me, Westernization is just a fancy way of saying "America subtly taking over".   America is too full of itself, I said. America thinks that it doesn't need anyone. America thinks it IS the world.   Of course, my thoughts were immediately and vehemently protested against, mainly by the male population who's testosterone levels were slowly but surely blocking blood-flow to their already undersized brains.  "I'm glad we're bombing the shit out of them! They deserve it, the evil bastards!"  "They bombed us, we should bomb them back!"  "We're being generous-- giving them food. We shouldn't be doing that, fucking Iraqis."  "Of course America's right. They're obviously wrong."  Ladies and gentlemen, the future leaders of tomorrow.  They were so gung-ho about going to war, they were like rednecks at a barbeque.   Idiots. Fools.  They don't know it won't be difficult to shoot someone your age. Someone just like you, wearing a different uniform but carrying the same gun. They don't know it won't kill them inside to take someone elses young life. They think it'll be just like the movies, all blood and gore and no guilty conscience or hesitance or fear.  I'd like to see them in the heat of combat. I bet they'd change their tune mighty quick.  I guess I wouldn't have been so appalled if these jerks were able to back up their opinions, but the only response I got to the debate was (and I QUOTE): "You're logic's stupid. My logic's smart."  Good grief.  I am disgusted with this. If my peers can't open their eyes for just a moment to see someone else's point of view, then we're all doomed to a miserable and wretched existence.   WE ARE NOT GODS! WE DO NOT KNOW EVERYTHING, NOR CAN WE HAVE EVERYTHING! WE ARE NOT ALWAYS RIGHT! WE ARE NOT BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE, WE ARE   EQUAL !  To all of those who sacrificed something that September morning:  Thank you.  Thank you so very much for allowing me to see things I wouldn't have normally seen, thank you for allowing me to be a better person and to defend my beliefs. Thank you for helping me be humbled by the vastness of perception.  Thank you.

      "Love,  I get so lost sometimes. Days pass, And this emptiness fills my heart..." ~  In Your Eyes , by Peter Gabriel   Ahh, it feels great to be back home. Not that the wedding was awful, or anything-- it was very okay. But after spending three days with people you don't know who are 6+ years your senior, it's great to get back to the old routine.   The trip was fine, I slept the majority of the 12 hour drive, so I really had nothing to complain about save the cramped leg-room and the constant old-people music. Ah well. Entering North Carolina had me experiencing mild cultural shock-- "y'all don' know 'bout red velvet cake?" (mmm, red velvet cake...) There were different wedding traditions (shorter than most, thank God), and lots of other stuff I didn't understand.  We arrived Friday afternoon around 11:30, after getting lost for a half an hour we found our hotel-- conviniently located next to a  Shell station  (Gas is real cheap down south), an  Applebees , and a  Hooters . The room they gave us was nice and included cable, but sharing a room with my mom proved disasterous. Stupid neat freaks...  There weren't many guests from the groom's (my cousin ^____^ Yay Bryan!) side of the family, so I was often left with a bunch of people I didn't know. It was rather uncomfortable. They pumped me on family issues and school and my social life, usually asking only after I'd taken a bite of dinner, of course.   The pre-wedding atmosphere was unbearably tense, and everyone was so high strung I feared to say anything lest I set off a nuclear reaction.   The wedding itself, however, ran smoothely-- the bride made everyone cry with her strange hybred of laughing and crying at the alter, and no one forgot any lines or fell over their skirts. On a sidenote, whoever invented high-heels should be shot >_____  The whole thing made me think, though. As I was witnessing a mile-stone in my cousin's life, if I would experience the same thing ten years down the line-- the frantic rehersals, the awkward kisses, electing bridesmaids and buying "the perfect dress", saying the "I do"s and pledging myself to one man 'till death do us part...  Then I thought, ' Good God, I hope not .'  I mean, what girl hasn't imagined herself in the dress, and having her friends as bridesmaids, and the beautiful ring on her left hand? Okay, okay, I confess that durring some of my more pathetic moments I dream of fantasy weddings and finding Mr. Right, but almost immediatly I trash the idea and berate myself for being so naive.   Long ago, I'd made up my mind about a family of my own-- I don't want or need one. What's so great about pushing nine pounds of flesh and bones through your loins, catering to a drooly infant day and night, changing diapers, teaching them the lessons of life and basically becoming this dreaded tyrant of an adult... It sounds kind of like a permanent baby-sitting job to me, and I don't think I'd have the patience for it.   It's not that I  hate  kids, I just dislike them. I've never really been one to think babies are cute-- I mean, they're wrinkly and pink and have huge heads and drool and are generally disgusting... however, voicing these opinions around many of my friends would result in a public beating...  As for meeting a guy I'd even CONSIDER spending the rest of my life with... well, heh, good luck. I've been told I'm extremely picky when it comes to guys-- I want someone intelligent (a feat in itself), articulate and poetic, and he definately has to be funny. I couldn't stand to be around someone that didn't make me laugh at least once every day.   "That's your problem, you don't want to be in love, you want to be in love in a movie." ~  Sleepless in Seattle   Anyways, even if I found a guy like that (yeah right), I'd be wary about the whole wedlock thing. I mean, I can understand and tolerate infidelities in relationships, but marriage is something entirely different. A person  promises  that they'll have no other, and then the go and do it anyways? That's fucked up on so many levels. So, basically, I'm chained to this guy until death (I dissaprove of divorces).  Does that thought scare the b'jeezus out of anyone else, or is it just me?  Part of me, the part of me that's dreamed of a wedding ever since I was seven, thinks about elegant white dresses and finding true love. The other part, the cynic in me, believes that it's not possible, and that romanticized versions of love and marriage only serve to blind people as they grope about for stable pillars in their lives.  My friends warn me that if this is the way I want my future to go, that I'm going to be all alone. That I'm going to die alone without experiencing "pure bliss".  Whatever. I'm not worried about it-- I always have my friends to lean on when the going gets tough. And maybe, just fucking  maybe , one day there'll be a guy that I love who'll be there to support me when I need it.  Heh. I guess there's a little bit of a hopeless romantic in all of us, eh?

      "If I died, would you shed tears of scarlet?" ~ Author unknown   Arg, another crazy day.   Mindlessly building yet another mountain of stress, I am. God, it's 9:00pm, and I have to be at my Uncle's at 10:00pm to start the drive down to North Carolina, and I'm not even packed.   I hate missing school for things like this-- to tell the truth, I'd rather be in class, taking a math test instead of at a wedding a million miles away from my friends and around a bunch of uncomfortable relatives in numerous awkward situations.  Ah well. Such is life.  Anyways, I was just pondering things in my free time (which has been growing depressingly scant as of recently), just who I was, to myself and to the people around me. Do people miss me when I'm gone? I've become so dependant on those close to me that it's borderline pathetic. Is that what I want? Can I survive being so dependant?  Something tells me a soul-searching trip in the near future is in order.   Anyways, just a random thought-nugget that's been digging itself into the back of my head as of late.  Well, I think I've fufilled my duty to post something pointless for my buddies to gorge themselves on while I'm away. Think about me, guys! I'll be thinking about you!  Hero of the day: Meghan, who's "Hero of the day" idea I shamelessly stole. I LOVE YOU, MEGHAN! ASIAN PRIDE!    Adios, everyone.  *Roars*

      "Nightingale, sing us a song, Of a love that onced belonged. Nightingale, tell me your tale, Was your journey far too long?" ~ Nightingale  by Norah Jones  You know, one of these days I'm going to type a happy blog, and the universe will implode upon itself.  Ah well, I guess the universe is safe for yet another day.  On to the topic of the day-- trials. Not government trials (don't even get me STARTED on the government...), I mean life trials. We all go through them, and durring these short but horrid points in our lives, we all simply want to crawl under a rock an die. You know what I'm talking about.  My life has been running me ragged as of late; AP/honors classes at school are driving me nuts, marching band (would you believe it?) is putting the pressure on,  and  I've been "hired" (I use the term loosely because I'm not quite sure if I'm actually getting paid...) to sing at my cousin's wedding. Not to say I'm not happy for them, but with all the other shit going on in my life, it seems like this is really on the lower-end of my list of priorities. I haven't listened to the music they want me to sing, and the wedding is this Saturday.   Hooray for procrastination.  Anyways, with my grandmother's death looming ever so close, I hate to leave... Besides, with all the school work piling up, I just don't know what to do. It's like God is conspiracing against me, and I'm about one more pop quiz away from having a nervous breakdown.  But (Hah! You thought I'd be completely pessamistic, didn't you?) I have found a hero for the day:   My good buddy, Brad.  Now, I'm not going into messy details, but Brad's been going through some rough spots in his own life-- emotional stuff that I'd rather not get into. For the past few days, he's been walking around like a zombie; dark rings under his eyes and a stoic expression so out of character for someone as generally happy as he. It was unnerving to see him so upset, and I tried everything just to coax a smile out of him, when normally he'd make me laugh over the smallest things.  However, being a leader in our marching band, Brad had to suck it up. Being a drum major, the band reflected his moods. We depended on him.  Because of this, he was forced to pretend (and damn, can that boy act) that he really  wasn't  suffering from intense emotional turmoil. He had to fake smiles and jokes and laughs I know didn't breach the skin-- all for the sake of something as trivial as high school marching band.  And so, I dedicate this entire (however short) post to Brad, my hero for the day.  And for all of you wishing that some meteor would fall from the sky and plow you into the ground, don't worry. You aren't alone, and things will get better eventually.  "Whatever happens, happens." Spike, Cowboy Bebop.  And that's all I have to say about that.

      "I don't know the key to success, but the key to failure is to try to please everyone." ~Bill Cosby     Ack. Just... ack. Do you ever get the feeling that your internal rhythm is off?   My life feels horribly out of balance-- one minute swinging just within the barest scraps of comfort and security before crashing out and sending me back into this funk of blah-ness. It's like I've built my tower way too high and now it's wobbling precariously, eventually preparing to throw all the blocks directly at my head...   Most of the time I'm generally happy, bouncy, energetic, etc. However, the tiniest, most insignificant things often throw my entire system out of whack, making me one Hell of a moody bitch.  God, am I ever tired of being unhappy... and making other people unhappy, for that matter.  But it's never consistent enough to do anything about. I've experienced more moodswings in the past three days than I have in what seems like my entire adolescence. And, quite frankly, I hate it. I'm not even sure  why  things are happening anymore; it all seems completely out of my hands.  You know what else I hate? The feeling that I'm not in control of my own life. Right now, I feel like I'm  just barely hanging on for the ride. One minute, things seem bearable-- school's peachy and people are too. The next, however-- life's kicking my ass again, school's overwhelming, and people are spreading their depression like a disease.   Eh. Must be all those teenage hormones or something just swinging me from one extreme to the other. As far as I'm concerned, high school is still just some glorified, romanticized version of elementary school, and people make way too big of a deal out of it. This may sound a bit hypocritical of me to say, but really, in the big picture high school is just a (sometimes) fond memory, and life does go on outside of it. People often seem to forget that, myself included.  Blah.   Sorry about all the above crap. I just needed to get that out before I blew up.  Rant over, let's get to what's going on in my life:  ~I've been sick for the past few days-- my head has felt like I've been wearing anchors for earrings and my stomach feels like it's trying to turn itself inside out. In order to attend school, I need to take the maximum dosage of aspirin and cough-medicine (which, I might add, does not and in no way taste like cherries, despite what the bottle says. Cherries from Hell, maybe...) just to get through the day. As a result of these massive quantities of drugs, my judgment becomes a bit muddled and I go about the day in a deeply sedated state, tuning in and out of conversations and lectures. Go me.  ~Our school marched at MSBOA festival and got the 1-rating that we definitely deserved. We were tired, we were sweaty, we smelled, AND we busted our asses during the actually performance. If we had received any lower, I'd have bludgeoned someone to death with my trumpet.  ~I'm starting to think that boys are (by nature) extremely odd and confusing. End of story.  ~Everyone's uncomfortably edgy at home. The parents have decided to buckle down on my brother and I, taking away privileges at the drop of a hat. This has resulted in several angry and violent disputes, which have not yet been resolved. Tensions continue to rise, and its really starting to get to me.  ~Drama's gathering steam, slowly but surely. The musical is going to rock, and I can't wait to see the finished product. Everyone's working so hard to get things to run smoothly, and it's not hard to see that the effort is really going to pay off in the long run. It'll be the first play in the new auditorium, and I am extremely excited to be using this professional theater to bring the production to life.  ~I'm receiving a 'D' in math. The first almost-failing-grade I've ever gotten, and it's really unnerving. I mean, this is junior year, the most important year of all-- the year that the colleges look for, the last year that I'll have to put any effort into anything... But, in short: math sucks, period.  ~A good friend of mine came over today and we had a nice, long chat. I'm glad she's feeling at least a little bit better; she really had me freaked out for the past couple of weeks with her no-talking-no-eating thing.     But you know? Whatever. "C'est la vie".   I'm fine. Just give me a few days to organize the chaos in my life and things will get better. A person can't be unhappy all the time, right?   Right....

      "I don't want a thing from you, But you're tired of me  Waiting for the scraps to fall off of your table To the ground..." ~ Breathing , Lifehouse   I was happy. I was so happy but, damnit, I couldn't hold onto it.   He said he likes me.  He likes me. Those words meant the world to me, and I felt completely full for just a dazzling second in the massive expanse of time. It was as if I had everything I needed even if everything itself wasn't perfect. I grinned like an idiot for over a day, replaying his words in my head on a constant loop and floating higher and higher each time. I felt whole.  He likes me. And, God, there is no doubt in my mind that I like him.  But... I simply don't know anymore.   We don't really know how to act around each other anymore. He's got stuff in his mind to clear up and I have insecurities to get over before anything can actually happen, and in this space of time I think that maybe...  I get this fear in the back of my heart... It chokes me from the inside out-- and old phobia, you could call it.   Will his feelings still stay strong come tomorrow? Or the next day? I fear that he may get bored with me, or that he might find someone better. It would be so easy for him to, because he's this amazing person and I'm no prize. Now that I have his attention, how on Earth will I be able to keep it?   The last guy in my life soon grew tired of me and sought better company, leaving me to wonder what it was that drove him off. Will history repeat itself and leave me broken again? Every fiber of my being is praying to whatever super-natural powers listening that it won't. I tell myself it won't, it won't, it won't... But there's always the doubt buried in my heart....  And also, as if I didn't feel cruddy enough as it was...  Some of the people closest to my heart have reached this extremely depressed state of mind-- I feel so useless not knowing the problem or how to solve it. They won't talk to me, and its tearing me apart just waiting on the sidelines for the storm to pass. It's like I'm on the other side of a wall too high to breach and too thick to penetrate; like there's some cosmic secret that I'm not being let in on. It hurts to watch these people deteriorate before my eyes, shriveling down to empty husks of human beings, withdrawn and alone.  How can I make you see that you AREN'T alone? That you don't HAVE to keep it all inside? My arms are open and will always be.  I don't know what to do.  I don't know what to do . I have all the pieces in my hands, but I can't get it to work...  And just like that, cloud 9 dropped about 8 clouds.   I try to stay upbeat, put on a brave face and act oblivious to the sadness that seems to thicken the air like a stale fog, but I'm fumbling for masks. I even allowed pride to escape  me for a fleeting moment and did something I vowed never to do, and still they were not moved.   You know, for the first time in what feels like forever, I felt significant. But now, it's like I'm not important enough to see or stop the invisible blade killing the people I love from the inside out. I try-- God, I try... But it's never any use. I wind up back at square one feeling more battered than before. Damn, I really need a hug right now... You want to know why?     I'm tired of getting pushed away.

      "It's a masterful melody when she calls out my name to me; As the world spins around her she laughs, rolls her eyes, And I feel like I'm falling, but it's no  surprise 'Cause I love her with all that I am And my voice shakes along with my hands, 'Cause it's frightening to be swimming in a strange sea But I'd rather be here than on land..." ~  Out of My League  by Stephen Speaks   As hard as I tried to keep this blog from becoming extremely sappy with my personal life, I have to speak what I feel before I blow up from keeping it bottled up. Be warned: major sap coming up, and I shall most likely make myself seem like an infatuated idiot, completely twisting around my disenchanted attitude into something almost pathetically optimistic.   I feel spectacular. I feel choking amounts of anxiety and hesitance, I feel unsure and self-concious, but at the same time I feel open and unrestrained-- the fact that I feel anything all after being so numb for such a long time still amazes me. Even with the heavy doses of fear and timidness, it's such a relief to be filled. I can only compare it to waking up and finding out that you can sleep for another hour-- it's a warm feeling that I can barely remember. (Bah! So corny!) There are times when all I can do is smile stupidly...  ... And who would have thought the cause of this explosion of emotion would be due to some guy...  That's right, you heard me. Me, the cynic. Me, the bitter wench. I've finally found someone to think about, someone sweet and funny, someone who's just what I need. Sure, he's not perfect or anything, but I love the way he makes me feel-- like I matter.  Now before you get ahead of yourself, I know I'm not in love, I don't think... I've been in love, but this is something different. I think it's just a strong crush.  A very strong crush.  I don't get to see him a lot, but when I do I feel like my heart can put the fastest racehorse to shame (corny, yes. Painfully so.) He's this wonderful person whom I've never really noticed until recently. I feel uncharacteristically shy, he makes me blush for no reason at all, and I fumble for words and become this ditzy thirteen-year-old.   Needless to say, I make an ass out of myself around him.  But I really don't care. I mean, as far as I know, he enjoys my company when we're able to get together, and despite the disappointingly little opportunities we have for private conversation, I think he trusts me. I miss him when we can't arrange a meeting, and get excited when we can. I even  primp  in front of the mirror, for godsake.   Good God, what have I become?!?!  Someone take note: This post will most likely be taken down from sheer embarrassment and fear that someone might work out who I'm writing about, thus exposing the secret to the world to my chagrin.    Ah, listen to me. I would have never thought that ANYONE would get me to spout this sort of idiocy again. Once was more than enough-- I'd had my heart trampled all over, anyways, the damn bastard. (If I ever find that sleazy S.O.B again I'm going to make sure he never has children.)  Anyways, this guy's the best thing that's happened to me in years-- a guy my parents would approve of, a guy I like being around, a guy that never makes me feel unimportant.  I'm falling hard, but I'm loving every moment of it. (God, corny line #8...)  But, sadly, the chances of a fairytale ending are slim to none.   You see, no matter what I do, I'll never be able to replace the person he's already placed in his heart. And, quite frankly, I don't want to. I don't want to compete with someone I could never measure up to. And despite my feelings for him (which--I assume-- are obvious, especially to him.), I doubt I'd ever be thought of as more than a fond friend. He's way too... Well, himself... And me, well.... You get the idea. It would never work anyways.  Heh, tell that to my stupid heart. Obviously, it has issues, and cannot listen to reason.   But, you know, whatever. Despite the hopelessness of my little crush, I'm enjoying it. I love feeling what I'm feeling, even if everything is unrequited. I'll do what I can to gain his attention, because that's all I can possibly do; and I'll float in childish euphoria when he says my name, and sigh wistfully behind his back, and go all stupid and spacy whenever I think of him (I'm such a loser ^___^).  "Yes, she's all that I see and she's all that I need, And I'm out of my league once again..."

      "When I wake up and the day begins, Do I hold my breath and count to ten, Or will it be three? We'll see, we'll see. It depends on which day of the week, So I sing out, I sing out loud-- I'm just one tiny motherfucker singing proud. Singing glory, glory, Hallejulah. Yeah, that'll do, Yeah, that'll do.  "In the arms of a city That holds no trace for the face or space for you or me, Go make a life, not a living Singing glory, glory Hallejulah. Yeah, that'll do.  "There's things to know, And so we're told-- But the days keep rolling on so painfully. They play it slow,  They say there's ways to grow, But blow by blow You see it all gets lost somewhere. See, I already forgot, So sing out, Sing out loud. You can be another motherfucker singing proud. Singing glory, glory, Remind me; glory, glory, glory, Hallejulah.

      "I sit here on my shelf, Just talking to myself, Words that we couldn't say..." ~  Words We Couldn't Say , The Seatbelts    Is it wrong to think of your own home as a prison?  I'm so sick of staring at these walls-- unchanging and sallow. I've never felt so bored with myself, like I can't do anything worth while. Nothing amuses me--  not TV, not drawing... I've hit some sort of mental block and it's frustrating me to no end. Lately I've been so restless, wandering up and down the hallways, staring longingly out the window, and keeping an ear open to the phone in case it rings with some invitation to the outside world.   In case none of you can read my subtle hints, I'm grounded.  My mother returned from her second trip to Florida yesterday morning (where we're digging up the money to fund these trups, I have no idea). Needless to say, I wasn't exactly looking foreward to the arrival. You see, my mother was never one for sensitivity.   There was no "Hey, guys, it's good to see you," or "Hi, Emilee; yeah, I missed you too," or "I'm glad to be home! What have you guys been up to?" There was only "God, this house is such a mess. I can't even come home to a clean house; you always leave everything out, Emilee," and "your brother tells me you've been bullying him. You need to appologize for that-- I don't know where you learned your mannors."   Apparently I'm being punished on the grounds of my poor behavior towards my mother's return.  Ah well.  It's just how she is, I suppose. Buisnesslike and stern. She expects perfection, and sees no reason as to why her expectations are never met. She likes store-bought presents over handmade ones (needless to say, she didn't like the drawing I made her for her birthday. She said it was a tacky idea to give someone a picture in place of a gift).... she's just proper like that, I guess.  Whatever.  She makes me fear two things: Becoming the person who failed at everything....  ... And becoming her.    Anyways, I really should stop complaining. I hate it when I complain... it makes me feel like some whiny-13-year-old-drama-queen.   For the most part, life has me feeling suprisingly apathetic towards everything, maybe even content. I've accepted the bad stuff, and enjoy the good stuff (mmm... good stuff....), I really don't see any reason to be upset. I'm young, I have at least 70 more years to get through, I should do my best to feel my best.  So, I've treated myself to late night television, second helpings on my mom's German chocolate cake, overdoses of leftover Holloween candy, and an extended Christmas list.  All in all, despite whatever miniscule discrepencies I have now, the thought that these problems will seem laughable in a few years makes me feel much better. Laughing usually does.  So I'll just wait until I can laugh.   P.S. The snow's here... Snow = sledding + ice skating + snowmen + igloos! *joy*

      "I will go down with this ship-- And I won't put my hands up and surrender. There will be no white flag above my door. I'm in love, And always will be..." ~  White Flag , Dido   Trying to get my life back in order is one hell of a task.   First off all, picking up the shattered fragments of all I tried so hard to keep from breaking makes me sick to my stomach. It's one ugly mess, I can assure you.  Two deaths in a month... It brings hot tears to my eyes just thinking about it. Recently, my other grandma down in Florida passed away. It wasn't something that I really felt like talking about, and I didn't break down again, but dealing with grieving parents was something I really wasn't looking forward to for the second time this month.   My mother left for Florida a week ago and returned yesterday, leaving  me alone with my still-off father. Not yet having recovered from his own mother's death, he was hard to live with-- I  was often caught off guard with "why can't you kids do anything without breaking something?!" and "you idiot! Don't do that!" and "God damnit, can't you do  ANYTHING  right?!"   Needless to say, it was a long week.  I figured that when my mom came home, life would return to as normal as it would get... Dad would stop yelling, I'd have someplace to hide, and I could begin piecing myself back together.   However, I was horribly mistaken. The first thing my mother did when she stepped in the door was make a snide comment on how poorly we had taken care of the house, then preceded  to bitch me out for not keeping our home clean. Since the moment she came home, all she's done is make me feel like I'm incompetent. Just one kick after another.   But I can handle this. I won't complain or cry. It has to go away sometime, and when it does we can all be happy...  Please, God,  just let us be happy....  ********************************************************************  He wants me to run.  To where, I have no idea.  But I'm supposed to run away.  Does he really want me out of his life that badly? Am I that much of a burden? From what he tells me, it's mostly for my own protection against a hurt that is "destined to come", but it doesn't make what he says any easier to swallow.   I don't know how to make things better-- it's my call, but I'm damned either way. If I run, it'll just be one more thing I've taken the cowardly easy way out on. If I stick it out,  I risk making the situation worse and possibly hurting someone I care about so, so, so much. Not much of an ultimatum, if you ask me.  I don't want to run; I'm sick of running away from all the hurdles in my life. But he  wants  me to. I just can't understand.  Sometimes I think he may have a point, that maybe it's not worth it. I wish that I wasn't falling  so hard for him, and, in my weakest and most pathetic moments,  almost  hope for my feelings to dissipate. Often afterwards, I give myself a mental slap-in-the-face because it was a stupid thought to think.   It's hard to make an unbiased decision when his arms are encircling my waist and his heartbeat is under my palm.  I don't know what to do.  It makes me dizzy and heartsick to think about.   To him, if he is reading, I hope that I'm not causing you pain by not heeding your warnings. If I am, that is not and never was my intent. But I can't bring myself to run just now. I have nowhere to go.  To him, you're not a horrible person. I may just be a masochist, not your fault. You will  never  be a horrible person to me.   To him, as I've told you before, I'm lost because I don't know where I'm going... Only where I've been.  To him, I think I might love you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

      "Four more exits to my apartment,  But I am tempted to keep the car in drive And leave it all behind...."  Why Georgia  by John Mayer    Today was just not my day, I guess. Very few are, actually-- but I digress.   Woke up this morning at 10:30AM for a doctor's appointment (God, I am the equivalent to the human petri dish...), and just felt like the whole world was coming down on my head. I don't know what it was about today, but there was this anxiety, this anger building in my chest that made me want to lash out at everything.... as if everything were contributing to my misery.  I couldn't walk a straight line, or even put together a coherent thought-- my whole being felt so fragile, but it seemed to be mistaken as a grouchy mood. Every time I was scolded or my mother rolled her eyes at me or my brother called me a jerk or my dad heaved a frustrated sigh, my heart sunk lower and lower. I tried not to let it get to me, but failed miserably.  Quite frankly, I don't know quite how to deal with anger. I can't let it out through my art, because if the image is ever found I'll be carted back to counseling. I can't cry, because part of me is too damn proud to cry, wallowing in self-pity. I can't really vent, because I'm never sure what sets me off in the first place. As a result of this emotional constipation, I end up all bitchy and pissy, snapping and becoming extremely defensive over the smallest issues. I want to break stuff and rip the world apart.  I don't know. Self-control never was my forte.   Today we visited my dad's store,  Tuesday Mornings , bargain shopping for last-minute gifts. No one asked for me, no one spoke to me. I was left alone and quickly forgotten amidst the fully stocked isles of rugs and kitchenwear and what have you.   So, I wandered. Most of the shelves were packed with boring living supplies-- pots and pans, tupperwear, cleaning supplies... But something about one of the isles close to the end of the store made me stop.  The shelves up and down on both sides were stocked to the max with painted glass vases, elegant crystal champagne glasses, white porcelain bowls and china plates, and glass candle holders. The entire isle glittered; everything was out and open and so extremely vulnerable.  The moment I set foot inside that fragile tunnel my mind slapped me with a scenario-- I saw myself letting loose an anguished cry and attacking the shelves, wiping them clean of their expensive burdens. All of my frustration, all of my anger and tears were reflected in the sound of breaking glass.   Flawless goblets fell in slow motion and shattered with an emphasized crash, bursting into a million sparkling pieces. My arms flew out ahead of me, my hands making quick work of the expensive dishes; rampantly, I threw them down by the armload to be pleasured by the satisfying sound they made when they hit the ground.    And then, when the shelves were clear and all the bowls and vases and glasses and plates were shattered beyond recognition, I went back down the isle, grinding the sharp fragments into the linoleum tile under the heel of my foot. I kicked at those pieces, stomped on them, turned them into powder and wrote my name in them-- the sound of breaking glass ringing in my ears.  But the second I blinked, the glasses had been reassembled and were sitting in neat little rows according to size and price. The vases were aligned next to the primly-stacked china plates, the bowls and chandelier arms sparkled perfectly under the fluorescent lights. Everything was as it should be.   In that instant, my heart broke with disappointment.  I feel like I'm losing myself, I need something to bring me back to life. I'm in the mood to sulk-- I don't know if I have the energy or the stamina to stay angry for very long. I don't even know what I'm angry at. The world? My family? Myself?   I'm in the mood to take a long walk off a short cliff. And I don't like that at all. I hate not being strong enough to take this, I hate how much I want to just give up. I hate how I can't fix myself, because I know I am broken in some way, and I hate not being able to know just WHY I've sunk this low.    Listen to me. What an ugly hypocrite I've turned out to be.   I hate me.

      "Myr is mine; it's bitter perfume, Tells a tale of gathering gloom, Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, Sealed in a stone-cold tomb..."  We Three Kings    I hate to be a scrooge, but I'm not exactly the jolly Christmas type. It was created with good intent-- celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, remembering the miracles God performed, yadda yadda yadda-- but it's snowballed into this entire production of mind-reeming propaganda and made-for-TV movies and competition for most expensive gift.  Not to say my Christmas didn't reap plentiful benifits, but the whole day was completely insane. I'd rather spend my Christmas at home, relaxing and enjoying the snowy atmosphere instead of baby-sitting the runts at my Aunt and Uncle's house.  Because of the recent loss of my grandmothers, we were all sort of unsure as to how to celebrate with their absences. So, we carried on around the empty chairs and the silent phone.   Anyways, my X-mas morning went like this:  8:30 AM -- I was rudely jolted from my comatose-like state by my younger brother, who had decided the best way to get me out of bed was by beating me with my own teddy bear.  8:35 AM -- I finished chasing my brother and screaming obsceneties to settle down in front of the tree with the parentals.   8:45 AM -- We ran out of paper packages to maul, and instead started to put our new gifts to use. There were lots of empty "thank you"s for the ugly sweater or the cheap neck-tie... But my favorite gift was definately my NEW TRUMPET!! ^____^ It's so pretty.  9:00 AM -- Attempted to help with breakfast.  9:01 AM -- Was kicked out of the kitchen.  9:30 AM -- Ate a healthy breakfast of sausage, eggs, and toast. After eating nothing but frosted flakes for breakfast for the past week, it was a welcome change.  10:00 AM -- Settled down in front of the TV to watch some of "A Christmas Story" 24-hour marathon on TNT. What a great movie.  10:20 AM -- Was forced to get up off the couch and pummel my younger brother. He had opened his largest gift, a remote-controlled hummer larger than our dog, and decided to play with it right next to me. It made all kinds of honking noises and engine noises, all of which were ungoddly loud, and it seemed to be extremely good at ramming itself into my leg.  10:30 AM -- Resumed watching TV.  12:45 PM -- Packed enough food to feed a small country in the back of the car and headed out to my Aunt and Uncle's.  1:00 PM -- Arrived at Aunt Dianne's and Uncle Bob's. I like their house, it's always filled with good smells and nice relatives. This year, however, very few decided to show up. Usually we have babies coming out of the woodwork and enough drunk men to fill an Irish tavern. This year we had a small party of aunts and uncles who pressed me on personal information until dinner time.  4:00 PM -- Was forced into an apron and made to toss the salad, which I did not eat.  5:00 PM -- Ate dinner, with one of the finest turkies ever. Mmmmm.... Turkey....  7:00 PM -- Watched "Pirates of the Carribean" on their plasma screen TV. It was sweet.  9:05 PM -- Poured my father into the car. He reeked of bourbon and blabbered the whole way home.   10:00 PM -- Arrived home after nearly killing ourselves several times on the slippery roads.  After that I Wnet directly to bed... Needless to say, it was a long day. I'm so sick of feeling upset. I'm ready for something GOOD to happen, and I'll keep waiting until it does.     Merry Fucking Christmas.

      "I would like to leave this city, This old town don't smell too pretty, and I can feel the warning signs running around my mind, And when I leave this island I'll book myself into a soul asylum, And I can feel the warning signs running around my mind.   So here I go, still scratching around the same old hole, My body feels young but my mind is very old. So what do you say? You can't give me the dreams that are mine anyway, You're half the world away, Half the world away, Half the world away-- I've been lost, I've been found, but I don't feel down.   So here I go, still scratching around in the same old hole, My body feels young but my mind if very old. So what do you say?

      "Cause you're living in a fantasy world Taking your time, running your mind on low. You're living in a fantasy land, Holding no one's hand but your own..."  Water , Jason Mraz    I'm not okay. I'm the last to admitt it, but I do admitt that I am not okay.  The days are fluctuating in speed, racing raggedly until it slows to a snail's pace, before stopping time all together. I go through the movements of my normal routine without any hindrence, but they're all empty. I can't smile without feeling the familiar churn in my stomach. But for the most part, I fool people. It's not really that hard; people are stupid. I slap on the happy face and swallow my unsettled emotions.  I want to die. I really want to die. But, alas (or luckily, whichever you choose) I am an enormous coward, and so the only thing keeping me tied to this horrid existance is my extreme fear of death itself. I can only pray for some freak accident to happen at any given moment, snuffing me out.   Everything seems so overwhelming-- I just feel like I'm not enough sometimes, it's choking and consuming and I don't know what to do. Instead of just running its course and dissipating, the sadness is turning into anger, which I don't know how to deal with. I just want to break down and break up and explode, but I can't afford to let myself go.  I'd promised myself that I'd never cry because of self-pity. I broke that promise today, and because of that I know something is horribly wrong.   Today I cried for the first time since my grandma died. I'm so ashamed of those bitter tears, I couldn't stop them. I cried and sobbed and hiccupped until I had to take myself outside into the snow to calm down before someone came home and saw me; we can't have a little sibling see his sister so unstable, or have mother come home and see her daughter so derranged. No one saw me. No one knows how pathetic I am, or else it'd just add one more bullet to the growing list of my flaws.  I can't even cry without being worried to screw someone else up.  God, I hate myself.  It was only this bad once before, and I'd hate for the reprocussions of that time to come back to haunt me now. I don't know why it's so bad or why I can't get over it, but it's formed a pill too large for me to swallow, let alone stomach. I don't like the idea of waking up in the morning and wishing I didn't. It just doesn't sit well with me.  My entire world seems to be imploding on itself-- I'm sinking and clawing for solid ground, but the strong pillars in my life have suddenly crumbled with problems of their own. There's no where to turn or to go, there's nothing to hold on to. I miss my friends, before they became as lost as I am.  I just want to give up. But I won't let myself.  When I was crying earlier today, I drew a picture, trying to relieve the pressure my anger and anguish and frustration was putting on my mind. Looking at it now, I question myself so much-- it's almost as if I don't know what I'm capable of anymore. The drawing is far more abstract than my usual work, and it's full of black and red and orange with cramped cursive writing and nonsense phrases covering the oddest portions of the paper. There's a cross in the upper left corner, followed by the words: "Don't let the world miss you."   I don't know what that means.  To tell the truth, I don't know much of anything these days. I just kind of let myself drift along, while I rot from the inside out. Some part of me is dying-- I can feel it-- but I don't know how to stop it.   I don't want help, I just don't know what it is I want from people. People often get really nosy, offering hollow promises to "be there for you" if you ever wanted to talk. What fair-weather idiots. I don't want to talk to just anyone, I don't want anyone else to make the problem go away; I  have  to do it myself.   All I can ask from everyone else is support. I need support to keep myself from sinking any lower and going under. Hug me. Please.   If I can just hold together for one more night, I'll have plenty of days to fall apart and put myself back together again in peace.  Un rapido noche, por favor, por favor....  Adios, mi amor.

      "Stranger than your sympathy, This is my apology. I'm killin' myself from the inside out, And all my fears have pushed you out..." ~  Sympathy , The Goo Goo Dolls    You know you have no life when getting a haircut becomes the highlight of your weekend.  Heh. Like there even was a weekend. More like a never ending week; I'll be dead by Friday. Last Saturday, I made $300 singing at a ritzy party at Oakland Hills Country Club (or something along those lines). There were rich drunk old men that hit on me, and rich drunk snobby old women that critizised me. All in all, it was a pretty eventful night-- I was almost granted some man's inheritance and had a woman call me a dog.   On Sunday, I spent the day going through the busy motions of a Oakland Singers Encore concert. What a pain in the ass. We got to sing with the Birmingham Concert Band, which was pretty cool, but it's the choir that I've gotten fed up with. The other members' immaturity and spoiled cravings for attention that really just piss me off to the point that I fear I might do something incredibly rude and sadistic.    God, I've been feeling super stressed lately-- everybody's counting on me and I'm barely holding the weight on my shoulders. And people just keep piling on more and more and more... I'm ready for a vacation.  Hanging out with the gang usually helps me relax and takes my mind of issues I really shouldn't be thinking about, but it's getting increasingly hard to sink into that plain of easy comfort. I find myself screwing on a smile and trying hard not to let people see the frown in it. I feel horrible because it's like I'm lying, and I want the people I care about to see me at my best... but I'm tired of telling myself I'm fine if  I  can't even convince myself.   Arynn called it the "Everything's Okay" syndrome. Sadly, it makes more sense than I'd have liked.  I guess I just need a rest from the toils of every day life. I need to vent and scream and cry-- but me and my damn pride won't allow me to do these things until the rest of my mind is satisfied that everything else will run smoothely if I break down.  And it's not like I'm not supported by my friends... Really, when I step back and look at my life I see nothing out of the ordinary, nothing that would make my life so much harder to bear than the next person's. I have a good life, I'm not denying it, but it's so hard to be content with it when the good life just seems so empty.  I really don't know how to act. I know that I should just wait it out, but it's hard to just sit tight and let this thing run its course. I don't want to worry anyone, because those I'm worrying are the last people I need to drag into my messy issues. And the people oblivious are the ones I really need to  see  me.   There are eggshells everywhere. And I'm shattering them.     Take deep breath. Count to three. Exhale.      I took a few meaningless online quizes.

      "This basement's a coffin-- I'm buried alive, I'll die in here just to be safe, I'll die in here, Just to be safe..." ~  This Ruined Puzzle , Dashboard Confessional    Ah, Eleanor Rigby, look at all your lonely people. They're everywhere, miserable and sulking. I add my own name to their list with my own damn hands, because I can do nothing else. I'm sick of myself and I'm wallowing in it.   Don't trouble yourself with me; I'll live. Shit happens, remember?  Last night, I'd written a super-uber-long entry detailing the turmoil in the depths of my ever-changing psyche; however, my computer began making ungodly noises and brought up the Blue Screen of Death before I could post, so I lost it. Whatever. Part of me wants to re-write the damn thing, but I won't today.

      "Another day where I can't find my head, My feet don't look like they're my own. I try to find the floor below to stand; I hope I reach it once again..." ~ Feelin' the Same Way , Norah Jones    I'm so ready for something good. Lately I've been feeling direction-less...   Because I've stayed home for the past three days due to strep throat (what a horrible, horrible virus), I'm so far behind on my schoolwork that it makes me want to scream and rip my hair out. But I doubt I could feel it anyways, what with the plethora of anti-biotics and painkillers I've been taking to try and ward off the sore throat and coughing and fever.  I get so annoyed with myself for staying home, though, because I'd much rather go to school and visit with my friends. I miss them so much when I'm by myself. My dad, when he stays home, takes pains to ignore me, and my mom is teaching little monkeys of second graders for the majority of the day, so it's just me, all by my lonesome.  Anyways, sometimes I get kind of worried staying out of the social loop for an extended period of time. The whole "out of sight, out of mind" mantra drives me crazy, and I really don't like the idea of being quickly forgotten or replaced. Not that I really have anything to worry about; my friends are the greatest.  Arynn, Meghan, and Brad came over to visit me the first day I was sick. I wasn't expecting them to drop by, so I was preoccupied with a rather pleasant nap when Arynn started wailing on my bedroom window with her fist (we have no doorbell, and I'd turned the ringer off of my phone so those damn solicitors wouldn't bother me).   Anyways, after groggily managing to stagger upstairs and unlock the front door, the crew paraded in, carrying four newly-purchased bags of ramen noodles. They'd even managed to buy two bags of chicken flavored noodles and two bags of beef flavored noodles so they could make bicken ramen, my favorite kind (chicken + beef = bicken).  Brad eagerly invaded the kitchen, nearly catching the house on fire trying to boil the water (*snickers*). Arynn and Meghan sat with me, catching me up on what I'd missed that day. We laughed a lot, mostly at Brad's expense, but it was all in good fun. It felt good to laugh, even though it was quite a task in my congested state.  Once the noodles were done, we all grabbed a bowl and dug in. They were a little overcooked, but still very good, and I was so flattered that they'd even taken the time to make it for me. Brad even did the dishes.   It's the stuff like that... stuff like that always makes me feel so guilty for ever doubting the quality of my life. No one had ever visited me while I was sick before, let alone cooked me one of my favorite meals. It was such a sweet thing for them to do, and it was probably the highlight of my month.   Thanks, guys. I love you.    As for the other four days between my last post and this one, my world's been pretty dumpy. I've been feeling really down, but I just can't figure out why. Maybe it's the sickness... It's hard to stay optimistic when you can't breathe through your nose.   My parents are irritated with me again, but that's no surprise. I've been missing more school than usual, and they're concerned about my grades. What bothers me is that they're not as concerned about my  health .   I guess I'm just feeling the weight of things recently.   Ah, well. A girl's gotta learn to suck it up if she ever expects to survive the  real  tragedies.    This is Emilee, signing off.

      "Five years ago, you pressed your hand Into a brand new sidewalk. It's well-worn now, and though some try, Your's is the only print there. You might not have meant to, but It's done you can't take it out. You're shy about what fortune lent you-- Is that what this is about?..." ~  Brand New Sidewalk , Nicklecreek      My life's beginning to settle into that comfortable niche of routine again. It's kind of nice not to worry frantically trying to pull things together at the last second-- I like knowing what's going on (though you know I'll be complaining about being bored with my life in no time at all...). Besides, I think life's had enough of kicking my ass and is giving me time to recouperate. I appreciate it.   I've never realized just how much support my friends were willing to give until I wrought upon them some teenage drama. They stood by me and offered me whatever advice they could-- and it was good advice, not just the stuff I wanted to hear-- they made me feel so much better about everything...  They leave a mark in me, an indellable print that can't be taken back, for better or for worse. Always there.   So thanks, guys. I love you.    Anyways, other happenings...  My grounding sentence is almost completely served (I'll tell you a secret: I've broken grounding by letting Brad drive me home two days in a row). I almost drove myself crazy not being able to leave the house-- I hate my home. It's never really made me feel secure or comfortable... A full week without any friends to take me away was complete and utter torture. However, as of tomorrow, I'm a free girl. Freedom rocks.   Eh. Due to being grounded, my list of events has lightened a great deal. Basically, I've sat at home, running up our phone bill talking to either Meghan or Arynn or Brad. All this time on my hands  has  reopened the doors of creativity and allowed me to draw and write a few works I am awfully proud of. I've used my new lightboard almost every day (I love the damn thing, love it like a baby), and broke the baby-E string on my guitar. I need to replace all the strings-- they're worn and old-- but I don't want to end up stabbed by a feminine guitar, right Brad? ^_____~   Today, I had PE. What a horrible class! I'm so squishy and out of shape; it's awful. There's a lot of running involved, and I have neither the strength nor the endurance to fufill the required quota for warm-up runs and mile runs and shuttle runs... Running ties my abdominal muscles into so many knots it's unbelievable. I come home sore in so many places-- I get achy muscles in muscles I didn't even know I had. So far, all that class has done is made me feel embarrassed because of my athletically-challenged body.   Oh well. Hardly anyone fails Gym.     Been thinking about what I want to do for the rest of my life... It's still a little fuzzy, but I'm starting to feel more comfortable with the mystery. I can do what I want, it might take a while, but I'll be able to do it eventually. There's always a way, the only thing that can stop me is myself. Besides, who knows what other options and opportunities may present themselves over the course of my young life? I can hardly wait to get out in the world, and really find out about myself. It'll be an adventure, one of my first.     It's late. I probably won't get a chance to update until we get a new, faster computer (someday soon, me thinks).  So until then, goodnight.

Lonliness dominates you. You can hide it well, but its there, and your friends can see it. You constantly feel alone, and need to do things to fill your time.

In any case, you are faithless and joyless. You find no happiness, love, or acceptance in your love or in yourself. Most days are a burden and you wonder when the hurting will end. Sweet, beautiful and sorrowful, you paint a tragic and touching picture. You are the one that few understand. Those that do know you are likely to love you deeply and wish that they could do something to ease your pain. You are constantly living in memories of better times and a better world. You are hard on yourself and self-critical or self-loathing. Feeling rejected and unloved, you are sensitive, caring, deep, and despite your tainted nature, your soul is breathtakingly beautiful.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       Heh.

You are Form 3,  Unicorn : The Innocent.   "And The Unicorn knew she wasn't meant to go into the Dark Wood.  Disregarding the advice given to her by the spirits, Unicorn went inside and bled silver blood..  For her misdeed, the world knew evil."   Some examples of the Unicorn Form are Eve (Christian) and Pandora (Greek). The Unicorn is associated with the concept of innocence, the number 3, and the element of water. Her sign is the twilight sun.  As a member of Form 3, you are a curious individual.  You are drawn to new things and become fascinated with ideas you've never come in contact with before.  Some people may say you are too nosey, but it's only because you like getting to the bottom of things and solving them.  Unicorns are the best friends to have because they are inquisitive.    urlLink   Which Mythological Form Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       The picture looks dirty.

Your soul is bound to the  Solitary Rose : The Alone.   "When I wake up alone, the shades are still drawn on the cold window pane so they cast their lines on my bed and lines on my face."   The Solitary Rose is associated with loneliness, melancholy, and patience.  It is governed by the goddess Merope and its sign is The Sword, or Unrequited Love.  As a Solitary Rose, you may be summed up as a hopeless romantic.  You desire love and have so much love to give, but thing just never seem to work out the way you want them to.  In life, you can be very optomistic, even when things are gray and nothing works out to your expectations.    urlLink   What Rose Is Your Soul Bound To?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      "Angel silver, raven black-- Just let me hit my knees. Tired of searching for something there That's meant for only me. Will you let me fall?  Close my eyes 'cause I can't stand To see you turn away. Loosing moments as they slip by Before they can be saved; Leave me empty.  Tell me how can you be happy?  A winding road, I've lost my way. Watch the gutter overflow,  You're breaking me again.  Tell me how much longer 'til The world comes crashing down. Watching as your face falls with it, And morning's left unfound. I meant no wrong.  Angel silver, raven black-- I can't make it right. Let the sky fall from my hands, And break down in the night. Open up the floor...  Pieces, pieces, that's all we'll ever be. In pieces, in pieces, fallen and empty.  Tell me how can you be happy? A winding road, I've lost my way. Watch the gutter overflow, You're breaking me again.  Pieces, pieces, that's all we'll ever be." ~  Out of My Hands

      "But in bed, before I fell asleep, I'd imagine what I would do if I were free of Lucinda's curse. At dinner I'd paint lines of gravy on my face and hurl meat pasties at Manners Mistress. I'd pile Headmistress's best china on my head and walk with a wobble and a swagger till every piece was smashed. Then I'd collect the smashed pottery and the smashed meat pasties and grind them into all my perfect stitchery." ~  Ella Enchanted , authored by Gail Carson Levine   It's snowing to put the North Pole to shame. Not only is there over a foot of snow weighing down our roofs, but there's a windchill low enough to freeze spit before it hit the ground.   I'm beginning to look forward to spring...    Last night, I went over to Arynn's house with Meghan and Josh, and we basically just hung around watching TV. It was great fun. Josh taught us how to send text-messages to Meghan's cell phone via Aol Instant Messenger, and we nearly short-circuted her phone by rapidly sending 500 messages of nonsense (Arynn sent the entire alphabet, with each letter as a seperate message).   Later that night, Meghan and I got to talking, and I was surprised to learn that she wasn't planning on voting even though sufferage allowed her to.  You know, for the first time in my life I actually feel strongly about the political status of our country. For years, politics were extremely boring, but now I want so badly to be 18; I want to vote. I mean, this year I actually know which party I support (I'm pro-choice in almost all situations), and I would lop of my right hand if it ensured that Bush wouldn't spend another term in office. I really want to be a part of this decision, and it burns me up that my voice wont be heard for another few years.   But anyways, enough of politics. I'm probably boring you with them anyways.    I know most teenagers hate their legal guardians, but when I say I hate my mother I mean I  loathe  her. There's no given time in the day when I'm okay with her-- she can't look at me without saying something to intentionally piss me off. I mean, I love her in a 'you-raised-me-so-I-have-to' kind of way, but if she were someone else's mom, I'd be depicting her eminant doom in extremely bloody pictures.  Yay. I'm bitching again.   I'm sick of being under her thumb, and I'm sick of being so afraid to stand up for myself and stop taking all of her bull shit. Her mind's so twisted and contorted around the concept of a perfect child... I can never obtain the image of flawnessness that she wants.   And it's all about image, my friend. If I look sloppy or stupid, I make HER look sloppy or stupid. She dictates everything. How I wear my hair, how I dress-- she'd decide who my friends were if I let her. She wants me to do well, but no matter how well I do it's always sub-par.   I can't tell if her expectations are impossibly over my capabilities or if she expects me to fail.  Looking back, it seems we've come a long way, even if we're no where close to having a decent relationship; I remember when she'd parade me around her work like a show dog, and I remember how threatened I'd feel when I get a B on a test. I was completely submissive, and she controled every aspect of my life.   Not anymore, thank God, but we've still got a long way to go.  One of my favorite novels is called Ella Enchanted, by Gail Carson Levine. It's about a girl under a fairy's spell that makes her completely obedient-- if someone gives her an order, she has to obey, no matter what the consequences. I've read it hundereds of times, and lately I find myself drawn to it again, despite its simplicity. I feel better reading it, because it has a happy ending.   Ah well. There's nothing anyone can do for me concerning this particular topic, but it soothes my mind to think that someone out there might understand.  So yes, mother. I agree with you. I am a bitch. I might fail as an adult. I might remain an idiot for the rest of my life. I may not ever be able to take care of myself. I might always be worthless. But I do know one thing: I will never be you. And at the end of the day that will always be true.  Do you think living happily ever after happens in reality?   Today I'm meeting up with a bunch of my Korean buddies, some of which I haven't spoken to in over a year. We've grown apart, even though we vowed never to. I feel like I've remained very much the same in my intrests, but my friends have moved on from horses to boys and cars. Today should be pretty interesting. I hope we can find some common ground to talk over for a few hours.   I'm breaking the rules by sneaking onto the internet with my mother's computer. I'd better go before she finds me and reminds me once again why my future is doomed to fail. So, on this note, I'll leave you with something I wrote a while ago but found and edited today:  "G-e-I-g-R-g-L Shells"  She bows politely and lowers her eyes, She?ll be a good girl today. She'll swallow the spitfire  And drown the monster That is she. Never again will she yell, Or raise her voice in protest. Instead,  She lays out the napkins, neatly folded With the forks and knives tucked inside.  She?ll be a good girl today.  Because her mother told her she has a beautiful voice Only when her mouth is closed.

      "I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been, And you have this letter, Probably got excited,  But there's nothing else inside it.  Didn't have a camera by my side this time, Hopin' I would see the world through both my eyes, Maybe I will tell you all about it When I'm in the mood to lose my way With words.  Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy's cliche, And strange how clouds that look like Mountains in the sky Are next to mountains anyway.  Didn't have a camera by my side this time, Hopin' I would see the world through both my eyes, Maybe I will tell you all about it When I'm in the mood to lose my way, But let me say  You should have seen that sunrise With your own eyes-- It brought me back to life. You'll be with me next time  I go outside. No more 3x5's.   Guess you had to be there, Guess you had to be with me.  Oh, today I finally overcame Tryin' to fit the world inside a picture frame. Maybe I will tell you all about it  When I'm in the mood to lose my way But let me say  You should have seen that sunrise With your own eyes-- It brought me brought me back to life. You'll be with me next time I go outside. No more 3x5's. Just no more 3x5's..."~  3 x 5 , John Mayer   Blah. I feel like I've been living a soap opera for the past few months.   Anyways, just a quick update before my computer has a seizure and dies for the final time (we've been having trouble for a few months now; our poor hard-drive is on the brink of a meltdown).    Recently I've been feeling better, thanks to the support I've been receiving. Though my problems are still very present and I still have my moments of utter misery, I feel like I have a purpose again, and not all of my smiles are plastic.  And I'd like to apologize to my friends for acting like such a useless, self-piteous loser. I didn't mean to be asleep and oblivious for so long.   It's almost as if I became my seventh-grade-self all over again, only more intense-- insecure and maudlin morphing into a tension I didn't know how to deal with. But now, all of the anger and frustration I've been feeling, the confusion and the hurt, is being filtered out of me and redirected into other projects-- I've really dug into improving my drawing skills with markers and pens, and I'm also putting a lot of dedication into my vocal training. It's helping me focus more on fixing myself, and I feel like I'm not failing myself all over again.   I want to be better. I know I can be better.  It wasn't if something inside me suddenly righted itself and clicked into place... Basically, I woke up one not-so-special morning and realized that I was not the only person in the world having a crappy time. My friend, Arynn, completely turned me around and reminded me that for every action there is a reaction. There were other people who needed me to support them more than I needed them to support me... and I felt like such a coward for even considering abandoning them again. As insignificant as my life may be, I love my friends more than they'll ever know, and I don't want them to feel like I don't love them enough to stick around.      So, I'm here. To stay.

      "Sometimes I think, oh yes, I'd move to Where all the shooting stars are gone With all of our wishes..." ~  Flying Teapot , New York Musicians    Well, we got the shit-load of snow, but not the day off. Whatever.  I had a fairly busy day today-- the first in two straight weeks of the good old R & R. What a pain to come back from an enjoyable vacation to a bland classroom with a teacher talking about stuff that really doesn't speak to you. I passed notes back and forth with my friends for the majority of the day, neglecting my work despite the looming threat of midterms just a week away.   It's not like I don't care about school anymore-- I know how crucial it is to maintain a decent GPA in order to be accepted into college-- but recently I've just given up on trying for the grades. Sometimes I worry about my ever falling GPA, but even though I worry it doesn't do anything to inspire me to put forth the effort needed to raise it again.  Oh well.   Anyways, I've been back to school for a grand total of two day sand already it's starting to feel like I've bitten off more than I can chew. I thought the break would help me to recouperate, but all it really did was force me to realize just how fucked up my head really is. And now that we've added the enormous pressure of school and midterms once again, I feel like I'm going to explode with all the anxiety building inside me.   To put it simply, I feel like shit. I've been feeling like shit and I've felt like shit for what seems like months, off an on. Meghan, I don't know how you do it-- putting up with this overpowering feeling of doom for so long. I'm having problems just keeping myself afloat.  It's like I'm teetering on the edge of a really long fall. It's only a matter of time before someone says or does something that pushes me off the point of no return, and God only knows how long it'll be before I hit the ground. The thought of falling really scares me.  I am trying to fix the part of me that I know is broken, but it's either working very slowly or not at all. It's hard to tell. I don't know how to make this feeling go away, so I'm trying everything I can to make at least a little improvement. Any at all would be nice.  Blah. My life sounds so sordid... when in all aspects it really could be worse.    Ah well. I'm a teenager, so I might as well whine for as long as people think it's common.   Just in case you're interested, I've been typing this while surfing Sparknotes.com for a summary on the 100 pages of  Catch-22  I was supposed to read over break (but didn't). I'm going to get back to that before the computer crashes.  Bai.

      *Update update update!!!!!!!!!*  God, it's wierd trying to get back to reality. I mean, for the last few days I've been watching the third season of Friends, so life without a laugh-reel is kind of shell-shocking.   Math, AP US History, Chemistry.... God, everyone 18 and under better be praying for a shit-load of snow.

I wanted to go to sleep so that I woudln't have to think because the only thing I could think was how much it hurt because there was no room for anything else in my head, but I couldn't go to sleep and I just had to sit there and there was nothing to do except to wait and to hurt." ~ The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time , by Mark Haddon      No matter what I do  I always  find myself  here...

      "I call And there's no reply, Like some phantom cry On ears too far away..." ~ No Reply , The Seatbelts      God damnit, fuck, bitch, hell, and every other vehement utterance I can think of.    I don't think I've ever been so  frustrated  with myself. Sometimes, I selfishly try to fool myself into thinking that the rest of the world simply isn't reacting the way I want it to in the concoction I've designed my life to model; but in all actuality it's only me that can't seem to adapt, and no matter how many lies I hide behind no one else will be responsible.   Every day seems to move at the slowest possible crawl, stretching out over years and years while I drag myself through the motions of being alive. I feel so heavy... I try to put on the good face in order to keep the attention away from the hollow feeling I have in my chest, but I'm not that great of a liar. I don't want pity and I don't want advice; I just want this stupid, stupid issue to go away.    Lately, it seems like nothing goes right the first time, or at all. I want to tear this bloody world apart, tear it up, crush it in my arms and then throw it away. Beat it up to make up for all of the times its kicked my ass.    I haven't slept in three days. Every waking moment I feel exhausted but the moment I crawl into bed I can't fall asleep. I stay up all night watching TV, or if I'm lazy, staring at the ceiling and thinking horrid thoughts until my head hurts too much to put a coherent sentence together.    I've also lost a lot of my appetite. I remember a time when I could eat a medium pizza by myself (not easily, mind you, but it was possible and not all that unpleasant), but now I can barely finish a packet of pop tarts. I feed most of my dinner to Sparky under the table, and my breakfast often finds itself in the garbage. Even popcorn (beloved popcorn... mrmm....) cannot entice me into a feeding frenzy like it used to.    I wake up and look at myself in the mirror and feel disgusted. I don't want to deal with myself anymore.   I guess there's really not much I can do about this. I surround myself with distractions in hopes of forgetting for a little while, but I can't be active all the time-- I'm dead tired as it is. Fixing the problem seems next to impossible, but don't worry, I haven't given up yet. It's just that I'm so very tired...     Ugh. Stop the world, I wanna get off.

      "Silence leaves too much room for thought-- The mind boggles itself until it hurts. Lingering in messy footprints, Clinging to some dim light; however, Existing over an eternity of idle days, The dream dies." ~excerpt from  Dimensions , 2-24-04   Though I'm no Troy "Fluffy" Angott or anything, I have been filtering some of my sour mood into poetry.   If your interested, look for it here:                                urlLink www. fictionpress.com/~siruspolaris   I'd love feedback.   Anyways (as you can see), I've been trying all sorts of things to get me out of the funk I've sunk into. The distractions are helping a little in the Happiness-department, but the initial problem is still looking to be solved. I'm working on it.  That's all I have right now.   Still here, Emilee

      "It never made much sense to me, Dancing on wires and waiting to simply be. Nothing was as simple as it seemed to me, Impermeable limits to my beloved sky...  How long was I content to stare, Captivated by pigment inside the glare-- Melted neon bled through the tears In the remnants of some broken rhyme.  The higher I go while tied down, The faster I become earthbound.  Stars made perfect atmosphere, Out of reach, so detatched from here. Comfortless-- there was everything to fear From a song only half-way sung.  A gear inside that wouldn't start Met the melancholy, abused heart But I couldn't take the two broken parts And make them into one.  The softer my bitter cries grow, The louder they echo.  Is anybody out there? Does anybody care That the fire in my glass dome Is taking all my air? Every lie I'm living in  Only lives to see me gone, Maybe I'm doing it wrong, But this is my life.  The incarnation of all my prayers,  Curved and glossy, my nightmare. I'd look for light, but there's none there; There's nothing there to see.  Set my mind for an open sky, It broke my heart that I couldn't fly, And nothing I did could stop the cry, But it never felt real to me.  I couldn't forget I was tied down, No matter what, eternally earthbound.  Was anybody out there? Did anybody care That the fire in my glass dome Was taking all my air? Every lie I had lived in  Only lived to see me gone, Maybe I was doing it wrong, But this was my life.  It never felt real to me." ~  Glass Dome , 2-22-04

      "Let me guess: it's a brightly colored box with a crank that I'm supposed to turn and turn and-- oh, big surprise-- a  jack  pops out. Then you laugh and the kids laugh and the dog laughs and I die a little inside..." ~ Stewie,  The Family Guy       Blah. There's just so much in the world that's irritating the hell out of me... And no matter how loud I shout no one seems to notice. I hate having my feelings and opinions viewed as generic. Being a teenager shouldn't null angst or depression. Age should not dictate awareness, either. I'm not stupid just because I'm 16. All 16-year-olds are  not  (thank God) all located on the same mental plane.   Why can't people see that? It frustrates me to no end to hear my views and my emotions belittled so flippantly... God, I just want to scream... Though I doubt anyone would hear.    I don't know... I haven't been feeling especially cheerful lately, and it's really starting to get to me. I hate feeling glum and useless, but I just don't feel motivated enough to wave over a medic. I don't want to have to alert my friends every time I feel like shit, I just want to be able to pick myself up. I don't want to have to jump up and down, wave my arms and scream bloody murder just to get support. They don't see me. I can't fix that.  For so long, I'd just wanted people to notice and be there to catch me, but I know that depending on the safety net is only going to get me hurt. I have to catch myself. No manner of Knights on white horses can just march in and save me-- that won't make it any better-- I need to save myself. I can't keep relying on others, because not everyone can be trusted not to let you fall. I need to learn how to fix my own wings before I hit the ground.   I've been fighting the urge to hide myself; I feel lost inside. All these troubles floating around my mind and I'm hesitant to touch them. You see, because of my horrible perception, when I try to fix things I only make them worse. I just want to push them out of my mind-- does that make me a bad person? To allow people continue to misunderstand, to let the lines stay crossed, to not care at all?   I feel like I've screwed up so much, I've done so much damage that I can't fix... The lines are too tangled now, and I don't know what to do. I'm a disaster trying to pass myself off as a polished human being, pulling myself in fifteen different directions at once and not even realizing I'm doing it.   God, if I could, I would start over.       And now, random quizzes.         You're  The Sound and the Fury !   by William Faulkner     Strong-willed but deeply confused, you are trying to come to grips with a major crisis in your life.

      "Set my mind for open sky, but couldn't fly, so sadly What am I? What am I? Sullen eyes shed teardrop lies then criticize, now laughing What is real? What is real?" ~  Is It Real?  by Yoko Kano    Sometimes I wake up in the morning and forget where I am. It's quiet and calm; yellow light streaming through the blinds in bars-- my room is a surreal vision of tranquility that couldn't possibly exist in my hectic life. I lay awake and watch the shadows move ever so slowly, all constraints of time seemingly inexistant for just a while. And I forget everything. I forget what year it is, what day, what the hour of the morning, who I am.... It's blissful to be nothing and everything all at once. Each breath rolls into one soft sigh, and nothing in the world could drag me out of bed when I'm in that zen-like state.  Though, I must say: lately I've been getting more than the required dosage of R&R...  It's been nice sleeping in to the wee hours of the afternoon. Then, when I finally drag my ass out of bed (circa de 1:30PM), I usually invite Brad over. We lounge around all day and then stay up watching Adult Swim cartoons. However, I  do  get this nagging feeling inside my head that says that all this sitting around is going to make me a boring person.   Anyways, sitting around and doing activities using the least physical effort leaves way too much time for thought.    If I asked you what we're here for, would you be able to answer me confidently? The question has been plaguing me for the past few days, and I can't shake the feeling that I'm wasting my life being lazy. I mean, the average person has, say, 70 to 80 years on the planet. Once dead, it takes about another 80 years for their memory to fall out of the cycle of the universe. Eventually, all those who knew you will die, and your memory will by washed away, filtered out of the expanse of time... like you were never there at all...  The thought of putting all this effort into life only to discover its significance bugs the crap out of me.   I mean, how big do I have to build my temple before its recognized?

      "Good day, sunlight, I'd like to say how truely bright you are-- You don't know me,  But I know you; see, You're my favorite star. Follow you, I will, so let's get moving...  Who needs shelter when the morning's comin'? Absolutely there's no one. Who needs shelter from the sun? Not me. No, not anyone.  Well the clock, the cock rooster crows, And it's off to work everybody goes, Slow, but eventually they get there. They're peckin' at the day shift, Back where all left off's confined in. They're peckin' at relationships, You know it's only A worthless piece of shit.  Who needs shelter when the morning's comin'? Absolutely there's no one. Who needs shelter from the sun? Not me. No, not anyone.

      Every time I feel alone I can blame it on you-- And I do. You've got me like a loaded gun, Golden sun  In a sky so blue.  We both know that we want it, And we both know You left me no choice.  ( Chaque fois que tu t'en vas ) You just bring me down, ( Je pretends que tout va bien ) So I'm counting my tears 'Til I get over you.  Sometimes I watch the world go by, Wonder what it's like To wake up every single day, Smile on your face,  You never try.  We both know we can't change it, But we both know We'll just have to face it.  ( Chaque fois que tu t'en vas ) You just bring me down, ( Je pretends que tout va bien ) So I'm counting my tears 'Til I get over you.  If only I could give you up, Would I want to let you off Of this soapbox, baby?  We both know that we want it, But we both know  You left me no choice.  ( Chaque fois que tu t'en vas )  You just bring me down. ( Je pretends que tout va bien ) So I'm counting my tears  'Til I get over you.  We both know  That I'm not over you...

      "It's been nice to hold your hand as we Shifted through this twisted abandon; I would like to think that you know your way. We have dodged the ropes of rain--  The cats and dogs, well they love to play on A hansome fella with umbrella  Who onced saved you your day.  I will ask you to open my door from your side, From the inside after you drive, Because I wanna stay wet for a little bit longer, that's why. I warm the engine compartment up,  While I stand here and think it up, 'Cause it's a little to early to burry the worry,  So this wish is my command  And I, Well I wonder, wonder which one of us Is gonna state the obvious. And I, Well I wonder if you already know That I gotta let you go. I know this ain't the way I planned it, I guess I ain't a great romantic And I'm not doubling back now. No doubling back, Doubling back now.  Now before I catch you complaining  That it hardly rains at all let me stop And lock the top for fear of it falling hard, By the eyes were ears and the arms are Scars of where the war was waged On words that we heard as a joke-- How did it drown our love?  Oh love, When it rains it's sure to pour; When I look in your eyes, I fear I won't see suprise That I'm not doubling back.  Well I, Well I wonder, wonder which one of us Is gonna state the obvious.

I know this aint the way I planned it, I guess I ain't a great romantic, But I'm not doubling back now..." ~ No Doubling Back , Jason Mraz     There isn't any reason for it.

      "Nobody likes me. Everybody hates me. Guess I'll go eat worms."       Once upon a time, in a place not too far from the ocean but very far from here, there was a pond. Murky and small, it lay in the dip of two dirty hills, collecting old rainwater and whatever debris floated down from the nearby city. Swampy weeds turned its bottom into mush, while bacteria coated its surface with thick algae; the scent of rotting wood and stale water hung in the air between the hills. Despite the dark, monotonous sky that hovered overhead, the grasses surrounding the body of water soon shriveled and died, for the ominous clouds never brought rain.   Very few creatures could stand to live in such a polluted environment-- a few toads, many creepy-crawly insects, and a handful of small, bottom-dwelling fish were all that habited the pond and its shores. Scruffy-looking birds, when desperate enough, would sometimes venture near the edges of the water to catch the meager grubs that burrowed along the bank.   However, unbeknownst to the casual passerby, one old fish swam in the shallow end of the pond, his dorsal fin skimming the surface and disturbing the greening water. Small and the color of mud, he had lived out many a year at the dank silt bottom of the pool. In his prime, he had been feisty and lively, taunting the birds by leaping clear out of the water and smacking the water with a loud  splash!  Now in his old age, the mud-brown fish had begun to tire, his scales no longer sleek and his body unable to do much other than sleep; he was content to simply warm himself on the dirty sand and dream.  Dream of open water.  Oh, he had heard stories; the little fish once had a very awkward conversation with an old swallow (the swallow was far too emaciated and close to death to be a threat to his life). The bird had weaved tales of water so big that no creature ever found the other side. Tales of magnanimous proportion, fish the size of trees and birds with gills. Trapped within the confines of his tiny watery prison, the mud-brown fish would often imagine a daring escape and a long swim in the big water that would last the rest of his life.    His friends, grown cynical with age, scoffed at the ridiculousness of the idea. Water expanding until the sun rose from its surface? Even if such a place did exist, they pointed out, how on earth did the mud-brown fish intend on getting to it? Fly?  It was impossible, they said.  And even still, the little old fish dreamed.   He dreamed and dreamed until the sun had set a thousand times and the autumn turned to winter turned to spring. And now, he was a  very  old fish. His eyes were beginning to cloud and he was going blind; his scales had dulled from mud-brown to grey; his muscles, once feathery and strong, had become stringy and limp-- swimming became an exercise. The old fish knew he soon would die...  And he would never have lived anywhere other than this tiny, polluted pond.  But then-- miracles of miracles-- it began to rain. For the first spring in his lifetime, the pond rippled with raindrops pouring from the over-saturated clouds and coming down in sheets, in buckets. It rained and rained and rained for an entire month, quickly filling the little pond until it overflowed and a small stream leaked the access water out to the east.  Birds, frogs, rabbits, even a few deer, all healthy and spirited, ventured near the dirty little pond-- the rain had rejuvinated the land and made it habitable for all sorts of creatures, not just a last desperate resort to dying beasts.  The tiny inlet was a door thrown wide. Many younger, spryer, more adventurous fish left the pond without a second thought, traveling with the weak current to wherever the stream led. The very old fish, once mud-brown, remained in the shallows where he could rest his weary fins on the warm sand.  'Maybe when I were younger,' he thought to himself with a sigh, 'I could have made the journey. But I am an old fish, and soon will die.'  Days passed, and the little fish remained where he lay, feeling miserable and growing older and closer to death. Even though the door to the open water was right in front of him, the very old fish was too weary and ancient to move from his spot.  His friends laughed at him. Grown older themselves, they too were too old to make the journey and were thus left behind.   'Go,' they goaded, 'you wanted so badly to leave that you wasted your life wishing.'  'Maybe if I had wished harder,' the very old fish replied tiredly, 'I could have made the journey. But I am a very old fish, and soon will die.'  To this they laughed. 'If wishes were fishes every bird and snake and toad would be full...'  At this the old fish fell silent and spoke no more for the rest of his life.    The very old fish, once mud-brown now grey and closer to death than he ever thought possible, spent the remainder of his days lingering around the opening to the ever-shrinking inlet; without more continuous rainfall, the stream was drying up. He lazily swam the length of the mouth endlessly, wondering what became of those who had taken it, his body becoming sicker and sicker with age and the inlet becoming smaller and smaller with the day's heat.   The day the pond finally closed to trap the very old fish within, he died. The very old fish had awoken in the morning to find the stream completely gone. He was so heartbroken that he used the last ounce of his thinning strength to thrash around violently, speaking his upset without words or tears. A starving bird, upon seeing the disturbance in the water, quickly took to flight...   ... and in the stillborn hours of the morning, gobbled up the very old, dying fish without hesitation.    The end.

It's entirely possible that YOU don't even know the real you. You have a certain fascination or attraction to destruction on a massive scale -  disasters, perhaps even death or the concept of the Apocalypse. Because you hold so much inside, one day you're simply going to snap. Then the mask will fall away, and your true wings will be revealed. Until then you will deal with whatever comes your way in icy bitter silence and acceptance. On the positive side, you are fearless and immeasurably strong - not much can crack through your defenses. You intrigue people, who can't help but wonder why you're the way you are. A loner and one who spends much of their time brooding and contemplating life and death - you are a time bomb waiting to explode and create some destruction of your own.    urlLink   *~*~*Claim Your Wings - Pics and Long Answers*~*~*     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla       "Let it rain, let it rain down on me..."

      "Stranger than your sympathy-- This is my apology. I'm killing myself from the inside out, And all my fears have pushed you out.  I wish for things that I don't need-- All I wanted-- And what I chase won't set me free-- All I wanted-- And I get scared but I'm not crawling on my knees.  Oh yeah, everything's all wrong, yeah, Everything's all wrong, yeah. Where the hell did I think I was?  Stranger than your sympathy-- Take these things so I don't feel. I'm killing myself from the inside out, Now my head's been filled with doubt.  It's hard to lead the life you choose-- All I wanted-- When all your luck's run out on you-- All I wanted-- You can't see when all your dreams are coming true.  Oh yeah, it's easy to forget, yeah, And you choke on the regrets, yeah. Who the hell did I think I was?  Stranger than your sympathy-- All these thoughts you stole from me. I'm not sure where I belong; Nowhere's home and I'm all wrong.  I wasn't all the things I tried to make believe I was, And I wouldn't be the one to kneel Before the dreams I wanted. And all the talk and all the lies Were all the empty things disguised as me.  Yeah, stranger than your sympathy, Stranger than your sympathy..."~  Sympathy , the Goo Goo Dolls      What I want but can't save me:  "I never was, am always to be, No one ever saw me, nor ever will And yet I am the confidence of all To live and breathe on this terrestrial ball."  It never comes.     I want to cut the cord and leave EVERYTHING behind, shut myself away and not let myself fuck up like I did back then. Everyone keeps telling me that somehow I'm going to make it through this time.   But...  I'm really sick of this, sick of everything being wrong, so sick of being willing to give up... I want to apologize but I don't feel sorry. I want to sleep but I'm not tired. I want to scream and kick and throw a fit but I don't have the energy.    And I don't know why He's not with me anymore.   It's just unanswerable.

        Still Branches  By Jack Simcock   The day waits quietly as though nothing has ever happened before as though all that will happen today  will be for the first time.  In still branches the day waits.  I wake without memory without anticipation I wake with closed eyes from an ecstasy of pining unrequited love long ago weak from a boy's heart broken for life in dreams.  First love is lost and saught in dreams tearfully. The pleading is remembered lived with Morning is to accept the loss.  I rise and go about my day and again everything is old and I do everything the way I always do it I say again what I said yesterday and everything I see I remember and everything is saturated in the past. The day waits quietly to be remembered.  Soon I am of yesterday and to the future.  I rise from a burden of ills  to a burden of desires I embrace each new day and it dies in my arms the same as yesterday.  I pass narrowly though a jungle of temptation Torments litter my way The blizzard of life piles me with beauty It crowds my days Grazes my eyes Lines my way from place to place from room to room The agony is the inevitable loss  I am buried in change alive and untidy Every day reveals more life to lose                              more loss to grieve                              more death to fear. The night whispers the truth.  I sleep for tomorrow.    I'm sick of myself.

      Your clothes never wear as well the next day And your hair never falls in quite the same way You never seem to run out of things to say. This is the story of a girl ~  Absolutely  by Nine Days   Gah. I wish my life had a sign erected out front: Please deposit all emotional baggage at the door.  Anyways, I think my life is finally resuming some feeble form of normalcy after the whole world fell down and everybody died. I think Im coping rather well for someone who had so much emotional trauma within a four day period. I wont go into details, but so much crap happened at onceit was overwhelming and for a while I just didnt know how I should react. I was pretty torn up, but I feel much better now. Its a tedious process, but Im slowly picking up all of the fallen blocks and stacking them as orderly as a mess of a human being can.   Im ready for my life nowor ready as Ill ever be, I guess.  In other news:  Thank heaven; I discovered that my ACT registration paperwork isnt due until May, so I have plenty of time to work on it. Its such a pain in the ass (pages and pages and pages of mundane information), but at least Im not several months overdue, like I had previously thought. *phew!*   To tell the truth, I really dont want to go to college. Its way too intimidating for me If it wasnt required for getting a stable, supportive job, then I wouldnt go at all. Its a taboo, anyways.   Recently, Ive been getting into some sort of creative funk, and have been spewing out poems like never before. Granted, many of them would make even a novice poet wince, but they make me feel very artsy. I checked out a book of poems from our school library last week; I really like some of them. Half of them I dont understand (Hell, I dont know anything about analyzing or theme or contextI just like the feeling I get when I read them), but many are really impressive.  This is one of my favorites:  Seeking necessity, he only found Someone who needed him, and married her. Having failed to build a house on solid ground He freely chose the sea, and freely drowned. ~ Live Mans Epitaph  by Francis Hope  Lets see  Took many a walk and searched myself being upset kind of makes you want to re-evaluate yourself a lot. It was kind of niceI was long past overdue for a good soulsearch, and now I feel very refreshed and comfortable with myself, though I do wish I could have had more relaxation time before school today. Ah well.  Brad and I went to Pierce for a while (has anyone noticed how damn low those ceilings are?). It was kind of fun seeing a bunch of old teachers-- not that I'd go back to middle school for a million bazillion dollars, but it was kind of nice to see how much things've changed since then. It was lots of fun, and Brad's got a recommendation for a lead role in a sitcom. Sweeeeet.  Lately, Ive been contemplating what sort of activities Ill indulge in to keep myself busy over spring break. All of my buddies (no exaggeration, ALL OF THEM) are leaving me for Florida, and Ill be stuck at home with only me, myself, and I and my MOTHER to talk to. Ill probably sulk, stay on the computer until it sucks out my brain, and then watch all of my favorite movies in other languages. That is, if my mom doesnt kill me halfway through the week.  Traitors. I hope it rains all week. >___   Went with Meghan to get her prom dress todayits so pretty, shes going to be the most beautiful Asian at prom! Hee.   So, in conclusion. Life sucks. Then you get over it. The end.

      It's late in the evening; She's wondering what clothes to wear, She puts on her make-up And brushes her long blonde hair.  And then she asks me, "Do I look alright?" And I say, "Yes, you look wonderful tonight."  We go to a party, And everyone turns to see This beautiful lady Walking around with me.  And then she asks me, "Do you feel alright?" And I say, "Yes, I feel wonderful tonight."  I feel wonderful because I see the love light in your eyes, And the wonder of it all is that you just don't realize How much I love you.   It's time to go home now, And I've got an aching head, So I give her the car keys And she helps me to bed.  And then I tell her As I turn out the light: I say, "My darling, you were wonderful tonight."  Oh, my darling, you were wonderful tonight.     Thanks for everything, Slim.

      "'Welcome to the real world,' she said to me Condencendingly.  'Take a seat, take your life-- Plot it out in black and white.'  I never lived the dream of the prom kings And the drama queens.  I'd like to think the best of me Is still hiding up my sleeve.  They love to tell you 'stay inside the lines,' But something's better on the other side.

      "Why d'you need a reason to feel happy Or be shining for the rest of the world? Give me just a smile, and would you make it snappy? Get your shit together, girl..."~ The Girl in the Dirty Shirt , Oasis    Hah. Hahahah. Go on, world. You go to Hell. See if I care.   Though things are still kind of rough around the edges still, I think I'm starting to build up some calloused resistance to them. It's been nice to finally smile and not have the lingering fear in my head that someone might see through it.    Luckily, everything is beginning to wind down with summer on it's way and all. My classes are starting to prep for finals, but after giving myself an ulcer over that damn AP History test, everything else seems relatively over-traumatized. I mean, none of these are really going to be super-hard (except maybe Chemistry, but that's only if I don't start paying attention), and it's really the only hurdle sitting between me and summer break. It's pretty comforting to know that I'm going to have a whole 2 months to recuperate from all of the mental trauma I've been feeling as of late. All I gotta do is hold out for three more weeks and then it's a long lazy stretch of inner-healing.    Turns out that I had nothing to worry about with any lingering awkwardness with Stevie's arrival-- he's such a kick-ass kid that it's impossible not to love him. He has this sort of resilience that's just so admirable-- sometimes I forget exactly  why  he's living with us, but then I'll see a slight instance where the old comes through and I can't help but sympathize.   For instance, his fondness of Legos. After finding box upon box upon box of the stupid little bricks, he nearly exploded with happiness-- apparently he had some at home but his delinquent brother would take them and throw them away. And sometimes Stephen makes up stories, saying he's been to places and seen things that he really hasn't because of troubles at home. Though it's hard to differenciate between the lies and the truth, he's such a sweet person and with outstanding strength that I can only envy.   He's into country music and baseball and Anime and  The Family Guy ... What could be cooler on an 8-year-old than a good sense of humor? He fit in so naturally it's already difficult to remember he's not staying forever.    As for having to control myself around the house and not being able to vent and be crabby-- well, Stephen's seen much worse, and he tells me he understands when I snap because he knows what it's like to be a kid (he's so damn cute!! ^___^ I just wanna hug him all the time!!) and so he gets the pressures and stuff. It's no real excuse to be a disgruntled role model, but it helps to think that I don't have to be perfect. There are still thoughts that shall be suppressed-if-not-banished from my mind until he leaves, but they're things that lingering on will make me depressed. The way I see it, I should just enjoy my time with my friends without lugging around too much emotional baggage. It only weighs me down and irritates them.   Man, I never feel like I'm in the day. The week's half over and still I'm stuck on a Monday funk. Weird.   Can't say I've done much in the past few days-- basically I stuck around home, trying to relax. Downloaded some rockin' new music (thank you, Arynn, for hooking me up with Limewire!) and have basically been sitting around, learning guitar tabs and pondering a writer's/artist's block.  Oh, just an FYI, I've decided that I like writing short storied. :) Cool, huh? I'd love some feedback on a few of my works, so if you're interested, they can be found here:  www.fictionpress.com/~siruspolaris   As for the art thing-- I've given my sketchbook to Brad so I wouldn't have to mull over the depressing images. I'm sick of crying my heart out over stupid shit time and time again, so I'm trying to clear my system of it. Besides, I'd hate for Stephen to find it and then ask me to explain some of the more morose images.    In other news, I'm in a band (wow. Talk about abrupt change of topic). As of right now, we're called Rootbeer Chaser. I make up 1/2 of the brass section. We have Arynn on guitar, DJ on bass, Scooby on drums (sometimes, if we're lucky -__-), and Jeremy as my accomplices on trumpet. I also work as part-time lyricist, but who knows if I can even write SKA music. The band seems to have a pretty obscure style that is a pain in the ass to find. Arynn wants to be goofy like Goldmember but meaningful like Five Iron Frenzy, while not sounding too Emo. @____@    Shit. I'm going to be late for choir practice... OH! If anyone in Waterford is free this Sunday (May 23, 2004) at 4:00PM, come to St. Patrick's Church for  The Feast of Life ! My choir is singing in it. Tickets are $5 for adults and $3 for senior citizens and children under 12. Heh. I'm pretty sure that everyone I know is going to Scott's birthday party...  Oh well. I've done my advertising.     Parting words: Life's a bitch, then you die. So don't belabor yourself about it and make it that much worse. Shrug the stupid shit and try to get on with the good stuff. "The clouds in your soul don't gather there for nothin', but I can chase them all away [if only for today]..."

      "Suppose I said:  I am on my best behavior, And there are times I lose my worried mind..."~ Not Myself , John Mayer (THANK GOD I FOUND  ROOM FOR SQUARES !!)     Well. It's been a while since I put forth the effort toward a  real  post, but I've had a lot on my mind..  I'm going to try to use this thing as more of a journal from now on; semi-public or not, I just want to come clean. Please, if you do read this, just leave it alone. I don't need sympathy or crude advice. I just need someone to listen.  There's been so much shit happening... I wake up in the morning after a few scant hours of sleep and try to operate as normally as possible. I go to school, tired as hell and ready to burst into a million pieces, when I remember that no one wants to see me being such a pathetic baby, so I slap on a smile and go about my merry way. I take the tests, I lose the assignments, I struggle for the grades and come home completely exhausted.   I hate parading around like a polished human being when inside I'm just a mess.  When I get back, I am welcomed by a house that's sucking up money faster than my parents can make it, arguments between my parents over trivial things like lost money and relatives, more people close to me getting sick and going to the hospital, punishment because of stupid mistakes, and everyone pressuring me to fix my fucked-up future. I feel so helpless and stranded; I cry a lot, even in school when no one's watching.   No one ever sees.  The few hours I have to just sit back and relax are fleeting. I feel like a wire stretched taught and being wound tighter and tighter-- everything in me seems on the brink of snapping and I just can't find a way around it. Suppressing the anxieties that plague me has been my main objective for the past few weeks, and for the most part I've got people fooled into thinking it's nothing but a bad day. But I think that deep down, I know it's only a matter of time before everything falls apart again and all my nerves are exposed.  Tests and grades and chores and money and jobs and arguments and fathers not coming home until the wee hours of the morning... it's been a lot to swallow.   And because of this, I've done some things I'm so ashamed of...   Have I screwed everything up for good?   Brad's come to my aid a few times, lounging around with me and offering whatever support he can. He doesn't know it, but it's a blessing when he comes to rescue me from myself for a few hours. It's been wonderfully stress-relieving, but as soon as he goes home I'm thrust back into reality that I'm not always sure I can handle. I hate being so dependant on him, because I  know  I'll be alone soon and he won't be there to be my crutch.     When my parents have a big fight (which has been happening much more often), my dad will simply drive away. I fear that he might go to a bar, get drunk, and drive home-- so I stay up until he gets home to help him into bed and make sure he made it home in one piece. This is probably the most exhausting part of my life-- I get so scared. I don't want to confront him about it, because I don't want him to feel that he's not doing his part as a father, especially when he's having so many problems with my mom. I just want him to stick around and not get himself in trouble. I need him still, and it wouldn't do at all if he lets go too early.  God, can't I even reflect without weeping like a moron? I really have to stop crying. It's pathetic...  Stephen's over, planning to test out our family by spending the night. I guess he's trying to break into the change gradually. He's a cool kid-- surprisingly mature and so very nice.   Stevie is 8 years old and in the 4th grade. His mother is a drug addict and he doesn't have a father. He and his brother live with is grandmother, who is in a wheelchair. Steve's older brother is going to be institutionalized for crimes I can't even fathome for one so young; he steels Steve cigarettes and God only knows what else. Anyways, the state is taking Stephan from his fucked-up family and giving him to a foster home. My mom offered to take him-- he being one of her old students-- and have him live with us for the rest of the school year and maybe part of the summer.    Change is a scary thing, I guess. But I never had any idea how scary it would be for  me .  Sure, I'm psyched that we're having him and such... but part of me is kind of leery of him. I know I shouldn't be, because he's just a kid and everything. Yet there's something-- maybe it?s sympathy, maybe it's suspicion-- either way I feel so uncomfortable. I feel like one of my last refuges, however small, has been taken away. I have to be Susie-Sunshine in the morning, at school, and now at home. I can't go out as much to escape the madness and pressure because I'll have to baby-sit.   But that only makes me a selfish jerk. God, what is wrong with me? I want to help, really I do, but why do I have to be such a bitch? Why can't I just be happy that we're helping? WHY do I feel so reproachful about it?  I don't know about myself anymore. I'm not a good person. I lie to people I care about. I do everything wrong. My life always falls to pieces in my hands. I'm such a horrible person.   And all I can do is complain. I want to do the world a service by crumpling myself up into a ball and throwing myself away.

      Step out the front door like a ghost into a fog Where no one notices the contrast of white on white. In between the moon and you, angels get a better view-- The crumbling difference between wrong and right. I walk in the air,  Between the rain, through myself and back again, Where? I don't know. Maria says she's dying, through the door I hear her crying, Why? I don't know.  Round here, we always stand up straight. Round here, something radiates.  Maria came from Nashville with a suitcase in her hand, She said she'd like to meet a boy who looks like Elvis. And she walks along the edge of where the ocean meets the land Just like she's walkin' on a wire in the circus. She parks her car outside of my house and takes her clothes off, Says she's close to understanding Jesus. And she knows she's more than just a little misunderstood-- She has trouble acting normal when she's nervous.  Round here, we're carving out our names. Round here, we all look the same. Round here, we talk just like lions, But we sacrifice like lambs, Round here, she's slipping through my hands...  Seep in chill, you better run like the wind  Out of the lightning, Momma's little baby better get herself in Out of the lightning.  She says it's only in my head. She says, "Shh... I know, it's only in my head..."  But the girl in the car in the parking lot says "Man, you should try to take a shot-- Can't you see my walls are crumbling?" And she looks up at the building, Says she's thinkin' of jumping. She says she's tired of life; She must be tired of something...  Round here, she's always on my mind. Round here-- hey man, we got lots of time. Round here, we're never sent to bed early, Man, nobody makes us wait. Round here, we stay up very, very, very, very late.   I can't see nothing, nothing around here. You catch me if I'm fallin', you catch me if I'm falling, You catch me 'cause I'm fallin' down on you.  I said I'm under the gun round here. Oh man, I said I'm under the gun around here.  And I can't see nothing, nothing round here...

      "I remember we were driving, driving in your car-- The speed so fast I felt like I was drunk. City lights lay out before us,  And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder And I had a feeling that I belonged, And I had a feeling I could be someone..."~ Fast Car  by Tracy Chapman     I feel a million times better. My friends came over several times this week to wish me well, and for that I am eternally grateful. Brad brought me flowers, ice cream, and good conversation while Meghan and Arynn brought the general hysterics and  the Family Guy  seasons 1 and 2 DVD. My friends and boyfriend rock.  The sores on my throat are gone and it's only a little swollen. My headaches have also cleared, and I feel great. For a few days I teetered between hospital-worthy and simply bed-ridden (my throat had gotten so swollen I couldn't breathe properly), but with addition of steroids to my already-extensive drug dosage I began to recover quickly.   I'm chomping at the bit for exercise, but I'm supposed to lay low for a week to make sure my fever doesn't come back. Besides, I was told to take it easy for the next two months or so to make sure I don't accidentally rupture my spleen or liver.   Of course, this doesn't stop my parents from forcing me into manual labor in order to "earn my keep". Aparently sick children have keep to earn. So tomorrow I get to move a 250 bag of dirt to the garden. Yay.  By the way, who buys dirt? I mean, can you really market something like that??  But I digress...   Man, I liked my parents better when they were scared I might die durring the night. They stopped treating me like I was beneath them and never once tried to hoist their egos on me. It was really nice-- almost worth the whole being-in-pain thing. There was no talk of how I need to work my way to a prestigious school, or how I'm going to pay for my own tuition, or how my artwork is just trash that clutters up the house.   Nope, it was great. It was "hey, how're you feeling?" and "can I get you anything? A popsicle, or some ice cream maybe?"...  But now that I'm generally okay, it's "Oh, when are you retaking the ACT? Alex Neubeck took his over and got a 30. You'll never get any good scholarships like him with just a 28. You need to show him up with a 32!"  GAAAAAAAAAAHH!!! I swear, sometimes all I am is a race horse that they parade in front of their friends when they want to show off how great their parenting skills are.  Anyways, all this harrassment has been making me want to re-evaluate my priorities-- could I be happy going to a school  not  specializing in the arts? Could I manage as a science major, or a business major? Would I be able to get a job that I'd be content with?  I don't know. They want me to be their definition of successful, but they expect me to be a failure.    But there is a bright side.     I won't always live under their scrutiny. I'll have my own life someday. And it'll be great because it'll be something I've made for myself, dispite their speculations that I'll be dependant on someone else for the rest of my life. I refuse to let myself live and die by their standards.   It's times like now when I realize just how much I can't stand their oppinions on everything, and my cabin fever becomes almost unbearable. Because they refuse to believe I won't get myself kicked in the gut within the next week, I'm stuck at home; I feel like I'm being grounded because of my health. All I really want to do is see my friends because I know they won't try to make me feel like I'm not worth anything as I am.   (DO YOU HEAR ME, FRIENDS? VISIT ME   PLEASE   BEFORE I GO FUCKING NUTS!!!)   But anyways, I feel much better knowing that I am firmly on the road to recovery. Soon, I won't have to stay under this roof and under their expectations and I'll be able to choose the people I surround myself with.

      "Kody sat down on the avenue, And he tapped his feet to the humming of the highway. He watched the light shine down on the broken glass And thought: 'Well, I don't got no reasons... yet.'  So there it is and there it was-- Now it was clear to all of us. We kept this hat of broken dreams, And we pulled them out when we needed them around.  So please hand me the bottle; I think I'm lonely now. And please give me direction; I think the hurt sets in, But I don't feel nothin'... yet.  There's a squeak hinge down on the back gate-- It lets us know if he comes around. But I don't sleep that good anyway, And if you've never heard that silence, well, it's a God-awful sound.  So please hand me the bottle; I think I'm lonely now. And please give me direction; I think I just caved in, But I don't feel nothin'...  Don't much get down to the avenue, I could drive but it takes so much to get there. Don't get off on all the broken glass, the cadillac scene-- Well, I've seen a lot of good things die  And I'm in an over-emotional way.  So please hand me the bottle; I think I'm lonely now, And please give me direction; I think I just caved in, But it ain't nothin'..."  Kody , Matchbox 20   They took him away.   They didn't even put him in foster care; they just kicked him in an orphanage in a hasty effort to finish the case.   We aren't to see him anymore.  And I didn't even get to say goodbye...    I'm sorry, Stevie. I wish things had worked out better. I know you'll stick it out-- you're a brave young man and we love you.

      The only way to keep your health is to eat what you don't want, drink what you don't like, and do what you'd rather not ~  Mark Twain    God, I  hate  being sick. It makes me feel so pathetic, moaning and whimpering like wounded tiger or something. Despite what you all may be thinking, the only thing thats really wrong with me is my throatits disgustingly swollen (to the point where talking makes me sound like a mentally retarded person with a speech impediment) and covered in open sores, making it almost impossible to eat or drink without feeling like Im trying to swallow a pinecone. For a while I thought it was strep throat, but the cultures came back negative and so I was sent to the Huron Valley hospital for blood tests. The results came back today.  The doctors diagnosed me with Infectious Mononucleosis, mono, or the kissing disease for those of us (like me) who are not currently fluent in medical text. They say that I am confined to my house for the next week, and that I am barred from any activity due to the danger of the infection and risk of hospitalization. I hate being locked up. Aside from not being able to swallow without feeling like Im stabbing myself in the back of the throat with a knife, I feel absolutely fine.  However, the idea of getting hospitalized kind of scares me. So Ill lock myself in my room for the recommended week, but I wont be happy about it.  Because the only thing I knew about mono was that it was spread through the mouth, I decided to do a little research, considering it may or may not be with me for a long, long time. This is what I found out:  -Infectious Mononucleosis is an infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus. This disease effects the lymph tissues and there is an increase of white blood cells that are mononuclear (with a single nucleus).   In case you were wondering:  Lymph glands are part of the lymphatic system which circulates tissue fluid. The lymphatic system drains fluids from surrounding tissues, filters it, and returns it to the bloodstream. By acting as filters, the lymph glands help to prevent the spread of infection and protect the bloodstream. They can become enlarged with any skin cut or scrape. Most enlarged neck nodes are from minor infections such as colds.   -Symptoms of mono include: fever,  sore throat  (that is a gross understatement), headaches, white patches on the back of your throat, swollen glands in your neck, feeling tired and not feeling hungry.   -Mono can be passed not only through saliva but by other less physical contacts, like coughing or sneezing.  -Once a person has been infected with mononucleosis, their body may periodically shed (or give off) the virus throughout their lifetime, possibly spreading the virus to others. This can occur despite the fact that they do not have symptoms after their initial mono infection; the virus may still be found in their saliva up to 18 months after they have recovered from their symptoms.   -Some newly infected people may not have any symptoms of mono and may not be aware they are spreading the virus that causes mono.  -The incubation period for developing mono is 4-8 weeks.   -A mono carrier should avoid heavy lifting, contact sports, and vigorous activity for 4-6 weeks after he/she has recovered. This will prevent injury to his/her spleen.  -Mono can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis [yowza!]) and spleen enlargement.  -Though a mono-diagnosed patient may feel better within 2-4 weeks, recovery can take up to  3 months.    -There is no official medical treatment for mono besides plenty of rest.    Well, it looks like I'll be under heavy quarentine for the next few weeks... It frustrates me to know that while I'm wasting away indoors everyone else is able to run and play and enjoy their summer without worry that they'll rupture an internal organ. I guess I'm just jealous...  Man, I hope my friends will still like me even though I'm all sick and disgusting and have been forced to become a short-term hermit...

      "Your tongue is a rudder-- It steers the whole ship, Sends your words past your lips, Keeps them safe behind your teeth. But the wrong words will strand you-- Come off course while you sleep, Sweep your boat out to sea Or dashed to bits on the reef..." ~  Play Crack the Sky , Brand New    Summer's here. No school. No work. Just lathargy and procrastinationI should be grateful-- I am, I guess... To an extent.  Right now it just seems like there's a gap between me and everything I love and care about. I'm trapped with only myself for company and I hate it. I'm afraid to just sit alone and I don't know why...  Maybe it's just me that I can't stand.

      "Another turning point, a fork stuck in the road, Time grabs you by the wrist, directs you where to go. So make the best of this test and don't ask why-- It's not a question but a lesson learned in time. It's something unpredictable, but in the end it's right. I hope you had the time of your life..." ~ Good Riddance , Greenday    Today was the seniors' last day. Man, to believe that they're going to be starting their lives so soon really makes me feel anxious and excited and nervous and sad all at once. I'm going to miss them-- all of them. They've become some of the best friends I've ever had, and life just won't be the same without them there every step of the way. Right now I feel so excluded from everything; the seniors and Emilee. Emilee and the seniors. It's not just our group anymore. They're off doing senior things together, like ice-cream socials and the senior walk and graduation... I don't think I can remember a time within the last five years that I've felt so little and left behind.  I know they can't help it. I know it's just in my head and I can't blame them for any of it, but it still pains me to see them go.  But regardless of the mourning period I know will inevitably come, I'm so proud of you guys. I know you'll have a great time in college and all that jazz, and it's not like we'll never see each other again. It's just that things now feel so final and forever...   Whatever. It's probably me just making it a huge, drama-filled experience when it doesn't have to be.   I guess what I want to say is something I'm sure you already know and are sick of hearing, but... I'm really going to miss you.   But that just leads me to thinking-- it's almost time for me to start my own life. Not that I'd like to stay in high school any longer than I have to (I shudder at the thought), but the big bad world will eat me a live, this I'm sure of. In high school, an environment I'm familiar with, I feel safe. Everything else is huge and pressured with significance and I'm... I'm scared.  I  do  have another year to dread the step out of the nest and into the wild-blue yonder, but it's right there, looming ahead of me like some dark cloud over the timeline of my life.  ... There I go again with the melodramatics.   I guess I just hope that I'll be able to handle it with as much dignity and apathy as my friends are now. They all scoff and tell me it's no big deal...  But then why does it feel like the end of the world?   I'm not ready to be any sort of adult. Ask anyone-- I'm the least responsible, least mature, least everything. I can't do this yet, but time isn't taking any pity on me and keeps coursing along as if I wasn't totally wigging out over this. I can't believe senior year is coming up for me. I'm terrified of it. How do you guys do it? How do you guys simply shrug it off as if it was just another year of your life? It's the last year of my life as a child, and I'm afraid to see it through.     Ah well. What can you do? Such is life, and all little ones are eventually forced out of the environment they grew up with in exchange for a bigger world. It'll happen, and I'll deal. That's how it goes, right? I'm just scared to make that first big jump, scared to let go.  They're leaving. It's finally sinking in. I know it's selfesh of me to want to hold them here-- I'm happy for them, really I am. I know if the roles were switched I'd be chomping at the bit to get out of here. But I love them all so much, it's stupid. I feel like I'm losing part of who I am.     God, this is hard. I can't believe I'm actually crying over this...  Good luck guys. I know you'll be great.

      "I don't wanna be the crutch, One step away from down. I don't wanna be the crutch, One step away from...  Man, I feel like hell, so come on over-- Be a love machine and I can be your friend. Ain't no shame; feel strong for one another Make a real true color come end to end, then God damn change of pace-- I think you got a piece of my heart on your face It's a shame to let it waste How does it taste?  Break it down in pieces, make it simple 'Cause you know damn well I'm a simple man. All these things go changing like the weather And they stay that way 'til the weather man says: One down, gone to waste-- I think there's still a piece of that smile on your face.

I'm a little screwy myself."  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  I apologize for the loopy posts as of late-- I've just been kind of in and out of a really depressing funk. I don't know what that's about, but I think I've come to terms with it (at least temperarily). Instead of stressing out over the fact that I can't be at home without wanting to kill myself, I'm simply going to let it go. I've accepted everything and I plan on simply taking things day by day until situation proves my methods useless.  &nbsp; Actually, I've been doing a pretty good job of distracting myself recently. I've been getting out of the house and THE HELL AWAY from my parents as much as possible. It's been really fun, and I'd sell my soul for more days like these.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Tuesday Meghan, Arynn, Jeremy, Cody and I went to Blender's party. It was super rad, though I think her other non-Kettering friends wanted to kick us out. We&nbsp;sat in a corner by ourselves and spent the time&nbsp;being loud and generally annoying (like only band kids can be ^____^ *pride*). My thighs are soooo sore because everybody was slapping each other. Then,  somehow , we got into this whole boob-grabbing thing.... I don't think I've ever been molested so much in my entire life.   &nbsp; Hahhah, this means that Cody's touched my ass and my boobs. Crazy sod.  &nbsp; After that, Arynn, Jeremy and I went and organized a band practice. We wrote a pretty decent song-- it's still kind of pop-ish but that could be fixed without much of an overhaul. I'm just excited we actually got something done without a total band-meltdown.  &nbsp; Today I woke up at 6 to tour CMU. All in all, I really like the school. The campus is awesome-- everything felt so comfortable.&nbsp;The dorms are huge (in comparison to other dorms, that is), there are bountiful opportunities to get out into the world and start working, they have the&nbsp;classes I'm interested in,&nbsp; and  most of my friends will be there if or when I go.  The only thing that bothered me was simply the fact that so many Kettering graduates enroll to CMU. I mean, it's&nbsp;not that I don't want at least some level of familiarity between myself and my classmates, but I just feel like maybe this is time to branch out a little-- like perhaps I should start out a bit more independantly. Start fresh with a new crowd or something.  &nbsp; I don't know... I liked it better than MSU and Hope, but I'm still not positive that it's what I want. I guess we'll see..  &nbsp; My friend, Nate, and I went out and rented  It Happened One Night . It's such a cute movie-- we're gonna watch it tonight. He's coming over in about fifteen minutes, so I'd better wrap this up.  &nbsp; I'm okay. I feel fine. Everyone can just fuck me over as much as they want now-- I can't stop them and I won't waste my energy trying. I have come to terms with my demons and pushed them back under the bed. They won't surface for a while. I'm alright...  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;

      "All I see are dark, grey clouds  In the distance, moving closer with every hour.  So when you ask, 'Is something wrong?'  I think, 'You're damn right there is,  But we can't talk about it now.  No, we can't talk about it now.'    &nbsp;  So one last touch and then you'll go,  And we'll pretend that it meant something so much more.  But it was vile, it was cheap,  And you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me.  Yeah, you are beautiful, but you don't mean a thing to me..."~ Tiny Vessels&nbsp; by&nbsp;Death Cab for Cutie    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;    &nbsp;   Think of England    It was going to rain. I could tell. The air always tasted different before a storm.   The breezes were humming with an electric tension that sent shivers down my spine-- the clouds hovered over the town in a most ominous manner, granite grey and thick with precipitation. Something about the excitement in the atmosphere appealed to me, so I went out for a little outdoor time. I brought a book and an umbrella with me, thinking to do a little reading in the park before&nbsp;the rain set in.   I took a breath and sampled the coppery tang to the air.   The streets were sparsely occupied, mostly by those bustling to get indoors before they got wet. The storm was still an hour away at the least, but the portentous, eerie buzz in the air sent many people scurrying inside. I made my way down the sidewalk against the flow of the tiny throng, umbrella in one hand and a dog-eared copy of  The Catcher in the Rye  in the other.   I headed for the park, but as the winds picked up their pace and began to whisper of prophetic weather, I thought better of it and selected a street-facing bench to do my reading.   I had almost made it through four whole chapters before something caught my eye; across the street, at the top of a five story building, stood a young boy. His silhouette was dark against a canvas of overcast sky as he paced the length of the roof, pausing ever so often to peer tentatively over the ledge at the ground below.   I looked around me. No one else had recognized the boy's presence looming over them as dark as the rain clouds. It seemed as if that was the way the boy wanted it-- he kept looking down nervously at the populated sidewalk and shaking his head and wringing his hands.   I watched him discreetly from behind Salinger's literature, trying not to draw attention to him by giving him my full interest. His skinny, gangly shadow told him to be young, though it was hard to tell because his facial features were almost impossible to discern from a street away. I could easily&nbsp;make out the tension in his stance and steps-- from where I sat, the boy looked just as ominous as the cloud backdrop behind him.   Unceremoniously, he stopped and approached the edge of the roof, clamoring onto the ledge and standing rigidly. He stared down hard&nbsp;at the sidewalk, feet spread apart and hands clenched into tight fists at his sides. The wind blew his shaggy hair around haphazardly, and the electricity in the humid air doubled.   I didn't know his name. I didn't know his story. But I knew what he was contemplating. Without a word I ducked my head back into the pages of my book, peeking up at the boy every few paragraphs to see if his position had changed.   For a full ten minutes, the boy stood&nbsp;perfectly still.   It was as I was finishing Holden's monologue about God and church when a voice cut through the tension between me and the other side of the road.   "Look up there!"   A small crowd had gathered below where the boy stood, pointed up with open mouths and looking like a flock of turkeys drowning themselves with rain.&nbsp;If the boy's figure was apprehensive before, it was practically paralyzed with trepidation now.   "He's gonna jump!" another voice cried out.   There was a chorus of 'oh no's&nbsp;and 'sweet Jesus's. It was something that to this day I don't understand. Sweet Jesus was obviously doing nothing for the boy if he was leaning over the roof of a five story building.   But no one moved to stop him. They simply watched him and mumbled to themselves how horrible it was, fixated on his stiff body,&nbsp;fascinated by someone so desperate as to throw himself away. It was interestingly morbid, something many had only seen on TV and in movies. And here it was, right up front-- live entertainment. Will he or won't he? Stay tuned for the exciting conclusion of 'Someone Else's Life is Crappier than Yours'.   The crowd was too busy gawking at the kid with a sucky life that they forgot to call the police.   But they didn't forget to call the news.   Basically the same thing... right?   Now, don't call my hypocritical. I watched. I'll admit it. I watched and did nothing to stop him. But I also felt I had no right to. Obviously the kid had something going on, and it was enough to drive him to the edge of a fall I had no business in stopping. Not if stopping it meant that the kid would simply go back to what drove him to the fall in the first place.   I uncrossed and re-crossed my legs, watching the scene unfold from the safety of my bench across the street. Television cameras and newscasters scrambled out of white vans. Police cars pulled up soon after with their sirens blaring, and a man with a megaphone began yelling at the boy and shouting at the crowd to move back.   Probably afraid someone was going to get spattered when the kid dropped.   Actually, I was surprised that the boy hadn't gotten it over with by the time they got there-- but it was obvious no one was making a move to get him down. It was too good a scoop; the public was already eating it up.   The wind changed as the boy took a nervous step forward. The toe of his ratty tennis shoe hung over the edge of the roof and into the air. The gathering gasped and the reporters narrated, flowering it up as much as possible. From across the street, I could hear their reports:   "The boy hesitates-- no, he's taken a stride forward! Oh, cruel world, to throw such a boy into such a horrendous situation! He's dangling on the edge of the rough ledge, hanging a split-second between life and death--"   Even from where I sat, I could hear his muffled sobs. His tears would hit the pavement before the rain, I predicted.   Speaking of the weather...   The clouds had begun to rumble, a guttural growl rolling over the city. The sky had darkened to a deep charcoal color, and the calm breezes that had caressed my face earlier had turned into angry, whipping winds that whistled along the ground. It was going to rain.   The people across the street were beginning to jitter nervously, the tension in the air biting at their spines. The boy felt it too-- I could tell. He tilted at a crazy angle, leaning forward with a sharp cry.   A woman screamed.   With utmost care, I drew myself up off of the bench and collected my things, tucking my book safely under my jacked to protect it from the storm and opening my umbrella.   Without looking back, I left as the scent of the air changed again; the boy hit the pavement just as the rain began to fall.   &nbsp;  &nbsp; The End.  -

      "I'll pick some daisies From the flower bed of the Galaxy theater While you clear your head; I thought some daisies  Might cheer you up..."~  Daisies of the Galaxy , The Eels    THINGS I LEARNED ON VACATION:   The good, the bad, the extremely ugly...   -Not all get-aways actually help you get away.  -Bringing your mother along is not a good idea if relaxation is your goal. For example:               +Mothers will cart along the most suit cases and then complain that we've brought too much stuff.               +Mothers will buy more food than you could ever eat and then complain that no one appreciates their cooking.               +Mothers will sit on the porch for hours and then complain that you're being lazy.               +Mothers will not bitch at you in front of each other, but will wait until you're trapped somewhere like at the store or in the car before making you feel like shit.               +Mothers will always find a way to ground you, even on vacation.  -Avoiding your guardian for long periods of time provides brief bouts of bliss.  -It also causes mothers to be angry.  -Sun = beautiful atmosphere. You'll want to be outside all day.  -Sun (also) = painful, painful sunburn.  -Lure fishing off of a dock is a waste of time. All you'll catch are weeds (and the odd pontoon boat, if you're as horrible at casting as I am.)  -Little girls will always catch the biggest fish. (*pride*) ^___^  -Band-aids are not waterproof, no matter what it says on the box.  -No matter what, a 5'1" girl cannot handle 6' waves.  -Sand. Will. Get. EVERYWHERE.  -It takes 3 showers to remove all traces of sand from your hair. And even then, your scalp will itch.  -Girls spend waaaaay too much time tanning and not enough time actually doing something summer-worthy. (Pansies...)  -All pretty/preppy girls MUST be blonde. And be super-uber tan. And have large breasts. And display them at every opportunity.  -Do not trust ANY random person you meet on the beach (especially if it's a boy).  -Not all people are music lovers. (I brought my guitar with me to the beach, and proceeded to get many glares from people who wanted me to "Shut the fuck up.")  -Guitars and sand don't mix well.  -In Holland, you can get anything you need at a drug store (including guitar strings).  -A girl can live off of strawberry flavored slushies for five days and no more.  -BLACK CHERRY ICE CREAM ROCKS MY WORLD!  -S'mores can be successfully cooked on a gas grill. (Damn skippy...)  -Though you miss your friends at home, you will love taking a break from every-day life.  -The ride home is extremely depressing...     I missed you guys, but I'll miss Holland, too.

      'Shut the fuck up,' she said,  'I'm going fucking deaf-- You're always too loud. Everything's too loud' Now that all my friends left,  This place is fucking dead, I wanna move out. Why can't we move out?  This shit has gotta stop...  I'll run away...  'Get the fuck up,' she said, Your life is meaningless-- It's going nowhere. You're going nowhere. You're just a fuck up,' she said.  I'll live alone instead, She said, 'You don't care.'  I know I don't care...  I'll never ask permission from you, Fuck off, I'm not listening to you, I'm not coming home,  I'm never going to come back home...  I got too fucked up again,  And passed out on the plane, Tried to forget you, I can't forget you. No sleep on this flight--  I'll think about the nights We had to get through,  How did we get through?  I'll never ask permission from you, Fuck off, I'm not listening to you, I'm not coming home,  I'm never going to come back home...  I'll run away; I think it's time that I should leave...

      "Your first dawn blinded you, Left you cursing the day; Entrance is crucial And it's not without pain. There's no path to follow Once you're here. Climb up the slide and then you'll Slide down the stairs.  It's foreign on this side, But it feels like I'm home again. There's no place to hide, But I don't think I'm scared.  There's no place to hide, But I don't think I'm scared.." ~ This Side , Nickel Creek   Mood:  Liberated :)     At last, I've found myself able to see deeper than two inches into my skin. It's a great feeling to finally let go of all trepidation and remorse and instead enjoy what one's got.  I'm okay. And I truely believe it. Whatever happens, happens, right? I mean, this is only high school-- there's a huge world out there that I haven't seen yet. There are things I haven't done, opportunities out there just waiting for me. There are people out there I haven't met yet, loved yet. A lot can happen in the future, you know?  So, I've made up my mind. I know what I want. I want to just enjoy what I have as long as I have it. And when the time comes to say goodbye I will without any regrets.    =)
