      Hey!  Sean is here!  How'd that happen?  Oh well, forget the homework today.  I'll be fine doing it tomorrow.  I just hope I didn't screw up my template by putting that counter there.....  If I did.....  I have no idea what to do...    Medal of Honor.  Not much more to say about it, except, "YEEEEEES!!!!!!!!!!!!"  It's definately a good game...  It goes up there with the scary tactics of Metal Gear Solid 2.  More to say later.........  Go america........Brainwashing kids with video games.......

      I put a counter on this site......I don't know what I was thinking........  It all seems so useless.....    Homework......I have so much I have to do, but I just don't want to do it.  I don't really feel like this is a remotely interesting challenge.  So far, I've done everything to the best of my ability, and it's really ruining my summer.  I can barely see my friends, and when I do see them, there's always that unsettling feeling of problems and panic on the horizon.  I wish I could just ignore all this and have fun, but I'm slipping into massive procrastination.  It's not that I don't like to write, it's just that all my work is so monotonous.  Oh well...  I guess I don't have a choice...  Go america......  Grey Davis gives us problems and we give him work........

              A new day.........AJ woke me up............I hate my phone, it rings like it just got shot in the ass...... Anyway, so far, so good.....I'm going to see a movie today........Either Minority Report or something else.....What kind of a name is Minority Report?  What 2-bit psycho names a movie Minority Report?  Probably the same guy who gave me a blog, as if anyone surfing the net is going to land here...   What happened to the shadow government?  They sound like something from Lord of the Rings.  I heard one thing about them, then they went away....Either I don't know enough, or they're all still stuck in their bunkers.  I think my uncle is one of them, I haven't seen him for months.    Dirty bombs........What the hell?  Strap some plutonium to a bomb and have it infect people.......Who needs plutonium?  Just put a crapload of bugspray in a microwave and run like hell.........I hope no terrorists get any idea from that, I'll never forgive myself.......Or if someone from the government reads this, they'll sick the shadow government on me.......     [7:43 PM]  After the movie:          Well, it wasn't Minority Report.  We got there too late.  We saw The Sum of All Fears, and Tom Clancy has never gone lower.  The one element that ruined it: When Russia was about to fire their nuclear arsenal on us, the camera angle was low, and when it showed the missile silo rising-up, the silos looked like two steel boners.....  Dear God, what happened to Tom Clancy?  AJ and I weren't the only ones to notice it either...  Numerous other people laughed, too.  Still, it was a good movie.  I can't complain, therefore, I have to complain.  Morgan Freeman has played the smart guy to the headstrong main character (Brad Pitt, Ben Affleck, etc.) with the girlfriend (Gwenyth Paltrow, Bridget Moynahan, etc.) in almost every movie I've seen him in. (anyone see Seven?) He always lives, even if the main character dies or goes to jail......  I can't believe it, but it finally happened.............He finally died.......I didn't think it could happen, but it did.  He's dead.  Maniacs couldn't stop him, bullets couldn't stop him, but a nuclear blast stopped him cold.  About friggin'  time.  You should see this movie.  You won't regret it.  Just see it with someone funny.    AJ wants to write something, it's good..... I hope.  This guy knows how to write.........Probably...   A Day in the Life   My eyes seemed as if they where cemented together, but they relented and opened. I sat up being careful not to hit the ceiling. I pulled the sheets away from my body. I was still wearing my swim trunks from the day before. The house boat was empty exept for the 12 twelve year old in his swim trunks and hazel hair. I opened the sliding wooden door into the hall. It is ladened with artificial wood and candels. I walk into the kitchen and take a coke out of the double doored fridge. It slams closed and the vapor swirls up and disapears. I walk to the sliding door and open it. Outside is a large jagged red clifface. The beach below as well is red. Blood red. Then I remember the dream. I heard screaming. I was falling. When I hit the ground a building fell on me. The reality came back to me and I walked to the second floor of the boat. I looked out onto the glassy water. Only then did I realize this was the calm before the battle. Nothing moved. I lifted the coke to my mouth and drank. I the feeling of drowning in my own blood. Someone was dying and more were to come.    End of AJ   I told you that was gonna be good.......  If you don't like it, you better take a long, hard look at your life.    I'm changing around my templates, so if one of these is good or really sucks, email me at jnickgould@aol.com   For now, just forget I said anything....It'll be better that way   Go america........Tom Clancy needs his job......

      My Blog...A window into the mind of a kid.......You're wasting your time reading this...  This site was made out of pure boredom, and the emotion that made it, will spread through it........ If you want to read something remotely interesting, go to bunnygurl.blogspot.com (the link wasn't working).....Don't ask me about it, I just heard some good things about it.  Besides, this person has original views.....Otherwise, you're here.  Welcome  "I'M AT BERKELEY!!!!!!!!  AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!  WHY GOD WHY?????" and God said, "I don't know why Nick, shut up and do something..."  And that's how it's going so far...  The work is hard, the hours are long, and the loneliness is overwhelming.  I have 4 more weeks of it, too.  My mind trails to the future, in North Carolina, with my brother...  I miss my other family...  And I miss my friends...  All my friends and even acquaintances have summer school or a job, but not one of them is anywhere near me.  New friends aren't quite there, but my humor has spread, so I'm not down yet...  That's all for today...  Go america..........

      My day was quite interesting.  First of all, I didn't get any sleep at all, so my whole day seemed like a bad dream.  Furthermore, and as the main gripe of the day, my cat died.  Don't even think it.......  She was the best damn cat ever.  She could walk up to you and  make you  pet her.  She would stand right in your way and she wouldn't move.  Now, I'll never see her again.  I'll never hear her nails on the floor, her yowling at night, and her slurping of food.    (Not done yet)

      Now, it's time for an actual opinion and not just a tag-board...  It's some-odd time in the morning, I have some serious iced coffee running through my veins, I just got through a long day of tiny cousins and loud idiots, and I'm dazed to a point where I thought of seeing the Scooby-Doo movie.    DISCLAIMER: Anything said at a time like this has nothing to do with the conscious thoughts of one Nicholas J. Sanz-Gould in any way, shape, or form, in this world or another regardless of how you know the afformentioned person.  All names mentioned have not been changed.  Screw the innocent.  Thank you.  Vanilla Coke???  What?????  Why???????  I like root beer floats and even sometimes coke floats, but this is just stupid.  People, we have to do something.  There isn't any vanilla in this at all!!!!!!  I couldn't taste anything different in it either.  I went home and put some vanilla ice cream in it...    Will someone tell me what happened to Billy Bob Thornton?  He had the movie with Bruce Willis (who's also missing...) and then he just went away.  Someone scan Arkansas for a 6x8 shack in the middle of nowhere.    How can there be a "middle" of nowhere.  If nowhere is a place of nothing, isn't every area the middle?    Good night everyone, I hope you folks have a good time.......

      Independence Day:    You probably expect me to say something witty and rude about America......  But I'm not...  Someone got shot today, and there's nothing funny about that.  When something like this happens, it's not right to make fun of it.  But enough of stating the obvious, I'm not exactly sure what happened, so if you want more, I bet everyone else's blogs have information.  Anyway, for some reason, I have a feeling it was just someone who was playing off the fear of a possible terrorist attack.  But I can't dwell on the sad.  Life goes on...  Anyway, today was a good day for me.  I saw Minority Report.  I just want to say that this is the best damn movie I have seen in a looooooong time.  This movie will easily rival The Matrix.  The only thing that's messed up is the fact that all this takes place in 2054, besides that, this is a god-like movie and I'm sorry I made fun of its name.  Go America......Today, I'm not kidding.

      What the hell is wrong with Jerry Springer?  I can tell that he's almost out of ideas.  "Next on Jerry Springer:  Was Robin Hood gay?  How merry were his 'men'?"           Why isn't he unemployed yet?  There has to be one person who is screwed up but didn't go on the show.  "Hi, I'm Jerry Springer, our research show's that you tattoo the words, 'Property of Squirrel Master' on every animal and person you see.  It also shows that you keep what you claim to be, 'the eyes of god' in a small jar in your den.  Can you come on the show?"  "Sure, buddy..."  That, my friends, is America at it's best.  Diversity has gone to a point when the Squirrel Master is king...  Go America........Hail the Squirrel Master.......

      I feel like making fun of another movie...  Scooby-Doo: First of all, to know this movie, you have to know the TV show.         For starters, they were  all high .  "How can you tell?" Easily.  They go around in the middle of the night a big, colorful van, looking for monsters and  food .  I imagine they did about 5 hits of acid and a lot of pot to see what they see, and eat what they eat.  Would you eat a sandwich that had been sitting in the middle of an old, abandoned house that's covered in spider webs?  I bet you would if you had the munchies like they did.         The friggin' dog is high!!!  How did that happen?  "Scooby, NO!  Don't eat that!!!  Oh well....  Hey Scoob, want some cheetos???"  It must've taken years and years of blowing smoke in his face to get him to talk.  Anyway, now that you know about the TV show, I'll get back to the real problem, the movie.  This is all I know, and all I'm willing to know before I see death:         I wouldn't see this movie if someone shoved the movie down my throat, and stapled my head to my ass........  For one reason or another, the gang goes to somewhere called "Spooky Island" (what a crappy name!).  There they meet ghosts and other weird acid visions that drive them to figure out why all this is happening.  Eventually one of them has a plan, they try it, it works, they uncover the evil person, ("I would've gotten away with it if it wasn't for you meddling kids!") they all end up happy, and everyone laughs because Scooby the pill dropping dog ate too much, the end.  I think the bad guy is supposed to be Scrappy-Doo (Scooby's deranged, crack-addict, nephew).  What kind of plot is that???    If anyone says, "sequel" I'll go berserk and kill the next talking dog I see.......  Go America......  No drug-usage on TV.....Unless you're a dog.....

      Will someone tell me why Sacramento is the capital of California?  Why not San Francisco, or at least Berkeley?  The suburbs have a creepy television feel to them.....  I can hear the canned laughter in the walls, always echoing for the live studio audience that isn't there.    We have the gayest Safeway in the nation and they have suburbanites....  We're a historic city with lots of interesting people and they..........well, duh.......  Go America...........California: As seen on TV......

      There's something I have to say........  "The true threat is whether or not one of these people decide, peak of anger, try to hold us hostage, ourselves; the Israelis, for example, whom we'll defend, offer our defenses; the South Koreans."                                    --George W. Bush, Washington DC, March 30, 2001  This quote forced me to ask a burning question:  What the fuck??????    I thought long and hard about this statement, through many a day and night.  It cost me many sleepless nights and troubled days.  Using advanced psychological therom and after many attempts to decypher the words from a scramble, I have come to the conclusion of this cryptic statement.  George Bush  is  Yoda from Star Wars.  Listen to both of them......and you'll see.    Go America........Puppets are people, too...........

Still, something is unsettling about them. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it has something to do with their Doubleshot. All it has in it is an espresso, cream, milk, and caramel color. What the hell gives it energy? I smell whiskey...   I just realized how dumb all this is, sorry for the inconvenience.

      School...........Summer...........What was I thinking?  Oh well, I'm learning a lot, I'm just really tried.    Anyway, I still stand behind my opinions on the Powerpuff Girls, but I aplogize to anyone who was offended.  However, if you know me, you should've known I was going to be an asshole.  I just saw that commercial for their movie, I pray for the minds of those who go to see it.  I lost 40 of my brain cells just from that trailer.  I think I'm going to far into this again.    So far I have 50-something hits, but if you take away all the times I checked on it, that would make 30-something.  Take away the times people kept leaving and coming back, maybe around 17.  17, feh, good enough for me.  Thanks everyone.  Speaking of bad movies, I just saw the trailer for The Country Bears.......  Disney is low on ideas.  "Based on the popular Disney World (Country Bear Jamboree) and Disneyland (Country Bear Playhouse) attractions, this is the story of Beary, a 10-year-old bear (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) who's been raised by humans. When he discovers his roots, he sets out to Tennessee to find his family, only to discover that the famous Country Bear Hall is about to be torn down by a greedy banker (Christopher Walken)."  How much acid would I have to drop in order to not tear out my eyes and throw them at the film projector?  Of all the shitty plots to come up in my lifetime, I never thought I'd live to witness Walt Disney turning in his grave...  Please tell me who sickens you more, Lil Bow-Wow or Lil Romeo?  I still have no idea how to put a mailto thing on my page, please help.    Go America.........You ruined the violent fairy tales......

      The Gay Pride Parade.  God bless San Francisco.  How many other cities have parades like this that are this big?  I didn't go, but I have friends who did.  Some gay guys hit on Katie’s dad.  It's what he gets for wearing a Hawaiian shirt.        "Only two types of people wear Hawaiian shirts, gay guys and big fat party animals, and Bart doesn't look like a big fat party animal."                                                                --Homer Simpson  Ok, so I've reached a new low by quoting the Simpsons, but I can't get much lower than that.  Please, find a better example of a Hawaiian shirt/Gay guy deal, and I'll put it there.  I just need some feedback for this place.   Man, I really hate the Powerpuff Girls...  It's like someone swallowed a glow stick, ate some marshmallows, took a heavy hit of acid, and took a giant dump.  As explicit as that sounds, that's the best as I can explain it.  They go around and kill people who don't look as cute as they think they are.  Cute?!  Where the hell are their necks??? Now they have a movie.  God, please send the Cartoon Network to the 7th circle of hell so that they may feel the pain the Powerpuff Girls have caused.  All right, so that went a little far, how about just setting fire to the Powerpuff Studios?  For those of you who do like them, I apologize for what I am about to say and mean you no harm.  I'm not saying any of this is your fault, I’m not trying to sound like a conspirator, but this just something I see to be created by the companies.         You have been brainwashed by cutesy subliminal messages and one day when the world is in chaos, you will all rise up as a giant, mindless army.  Legions of you will raid the land killing the ugly, the intelligent, and anyone with an opinion that wasn't created by advertisements.  Those you had left behind will be swallowed in the flames of ignorance.  A post-apocalyptic earth will cry out in anguish (I know I'm going a bit far, but stay with me on this one) as all life is wiped away to make room for and supply corporations.  After it's all over, the only use for the armies is fuel for the fire, and you will willingly march into the incinerator all for those cute, fluffy, little, neck less Powerpuff Girls.             Remember, keep your own mind, don't fall victim to what is said to be.  Like I always say, "If it's cute and fluffy, it's probably trying to kill you."  I know I had more to say, but I think I've gone far enough.    Go America.........  Cutesy cartoons need a home to plot the dumbing of the world.....

I was going to update at 3:30, but I was too close to passing out.  It would've come out as, "Yousallz zselifz know wat I feel likew?: Yeahfl....."  so I decided to skip that.    Now, with my remaining day before class on Monday, I shall work as if I were getting paid for it.    Why do all the people who make excercise equipment act as if they were hopped up on crack?  Why do I care?  Why are you still reading this?  The only excuse for todays post is that I wanted to write something and couldn't think of anything to say.    As long as you're here, you should read what AJ wrote.......I know I said it was good before, but now it confuses me a little.  If you can tell me what's happening, email me at jnickgould@aol.com and tell me what I missed and I'll......Uhhhhhh..........Never mind.

      America: Land of the free and the home of the......heroin addicts?  "In The Futurological Congress (1971), Polish writer Stanislaw Lem portrayed a future in which disobedience is controlled with hypothetical mind-altering chemicals dubbed "benignimizers". Lem's fictional work opens with the frightening story of a police and military biochemical attack on protesters outside of an international scientific convention. As the environment becomes saturated with hallucinogenic agents, in Lem's tale the protesters (and bystanders) descend into chaos, overcome by delusions and feelings of complacency, self-doubt, and even love.  If the Pentagon's Joint Non-Lethal Weapons Directorate (JNLWD) has its way, Lem may be remembered as a prophet."  In other words, heroin addicts rejoice!  Go to a protest and have the worst trip of your life!!!  I hope I'm not the only one scared by this.  A number of wackos want to create crowd-control weapons that not only stop "riots", but cause all those in the line of fire to go on something not different from a heroin trip that would send the target to the seventh circle of Hell...    The teams making the weapons are working on a number of psychiatric and anesthetic pharmaceuticals (such as the date rape drug........).  According to the report, "the choice administration route, whether application to drinking water, topical administration to the skin, an aerosol spray inhalation route, or a drug filled rubber bullet, among others, will depend on the environment."  Why don't the cops just throw a giant rave every time a riot breaks out?    I'll look at it positively.....  May'be the drugs will have a better effect on society and allow potentially dangerous situation to be safe...........   "As of March 2002, the team was researching a mix of pepper spray ("OC") and an unidentified calmative agent. Pepper spray is the most powerful chemical crowd control agent in use, and has been associated with numerous deaths."    Never mind..........  I'll stick with my first view.......    Go America........  We have the most complicated drug laws, don't we?   To see the real version of what was talking about and not just a tiny plagiarism, go  urlLink here

      I'm sick.....  Ladies and gentlemen......  I'm sick.......  Feh.......  Nickelodeon has really gone down the tubes....  You may find it weird that I still watch that, but if I see that Nelly video for "It's Getting Hot In Here" again, I'm going to start taking off my clothes........  And no one, but  no one  wants to see that.......  But anyway......  The only good show I've seen is Invader Zim......  A weird, pissed-off alien and a retarded robot are thrown into a darker earth........  The entire show screams evil, which is probably why they never show it.  This guy would eat the Rugrats, spit out their bones, and crap on their graves.  I find myself in shame that I'm still talking about Nickelodeon, so let's move on, shall we?  What has happened to the acid-spitting, face-swiping, bone-crushing, chest-bursting aliens of my day?  ET was just a prune spliced with Elmo, Stitch was a Smurf on crack, and the aliens from Encounters of the Third Kind were just clones of Mozart.  But the aliens from the Aliens trilogy were the most unstoppable bastards ever!  You shoot them; you burn in their blood...  Genius!  You look at their eggs; you end-up puking out your heart and giving birth to a pissed-off little worm!   Genius!!!   Where is the violence in Disney these days???   Go America........  Wait….

Anyway, today I went to the Marin County Fair, and now, I introduce my GUIDE TO CARNIE FOLK!!!!!  First off: Newbie carnie:  More often selling than gaming, younger, no evident personality.  Running into these people wouldn't make a difference.  If you can tell they're trying to act like a carnie with experience, forget them, just get your crap and walk away.  Expert carnie:  These carnies can be anyone.  They have no universal style, but they are masters of their station and they will show off what they can do as if to say, "Anyone can do it...” If young or cute enough you can get something for free from them, just beware of getting suckered into paying $20 for some crap.  Death before dishonor.  Drunk-novice carnie:  Low experience + high alcohol intake = oh my god, she's dead...  These folk are trying to keep awake and entertained through the whole time they're there.  Tired of hearing all the same old crap, they long for an escape....  Too many cops there, so they go for the Budweiser truck...  When at demonstrations, avoid them, but if you get them at games, take advantage of them.  If there's only one of them, you can easily lie about what happened.  However, let it be known, that all drunk-novice carnies become experts, so just think of every one of them as the "ugly little duckling"...  Drunk-experts:  Pretty much the same as above, just not as easy to trick.  They can be a bit meaner and have a heavier slurred voice........  Brain-dead "technicians":  These folk operate the rides.  They're tired of strapping people in for the ride and pushing the same buttons, so they long for anything different. Just don't give it to them or it'll get worse.  You don't need to talk to them for any reason, so just enjoy the ride.  Food vendors:  Usually the nicest folk around.  As far as I have known, they barely ever get drunk because they'll always have food to sop-up the booze.  Enjoy these folk, they have a certain power over all other folk and consumers.  Probably because they handle everything you eat, they can easily screw up and give you food poisoning.  Cheers.  Ticket holders:  Screw it, these people aren't worth the print.  All I'm going to say is that these people don't give half a shit what you have on you.  They're supposed to search you for suspicious objects, but if you blend in and look them in the eyes, you can get by.  More to add later......   Go America........ This country brought to you by carnies: The fabric of our lives.......

      Ladies and Gentlemen, I've brought you here today to announce an important discovery in the field of geriatrics.  Through extensive research, I have come to information that may help millions of elderly people worldwide and will forever change the way we look at life and death:  When old people are talking about taking a shit, they will call it a "Bowel Movement" or "BM"; but if they are pissed off or trying to describe something annoying, they will openly say, "Shit!"  Unusual???   Thank you.

      Well, in desperation and hopelessness, I've decided to write  about my day .  That's right, my opinions have gone to crap and I'm out of anything worthwhile.  So here it goes...  I'm so sorry...  I woke up with chicken hangover in my uncle's room (no, he wasn't there...).  I had to be there because I couldn't sleep in the same room as Joe: The Amazing Insomniac.  After fighting off my returning sleep, I went into my room........where everyone else was.  We played Grand Theft Auto 3 for a while, and soon, AJ left.  Joe was supposed to leave, but we were all addicted to GTA3, especially Joe ("I'll leave in five minutes").  After everyone was gone, except Nora, well, most of the day was a blur of TV, video games, and computer crap.  Around 6, my dad kicked us out, so we went to the park and played basketball.  Any third party looking at us was laughing to a coma.  I hope they never come out of it.  The rest of the night was just like most of the day, and now you've read this shit as I'm writing it.  I'm really sorry.....  If I ever think of anything good to write, I'll do it.........

      People.............  I miss you........  I really miss you................................    My cousin has a blog.........  urlLink here  She  will  make you think about your life in a new way......  And if not, then you can't sue me because I didn't  promise  anything, and this isn't a valid legal document recognized by the California law offices...  So piss off.......  "I hope everyone is having a decent summer," I would say.  And you would go on thinking, "I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE!!!!!!!  STOP IT!!!   STOP IT!!!!!!!!!  "  So fine, all I have to say now is filler, and I don't really care how your summer is.....  Just give me until my next post to cheer up and say, "Summer is great!!! Yay!!!!!"    Good night......

      Hey, I'm done with Berkeley!  I am going to miss my friends though.  I'll be back next year, but I'm stuck between 3 choices:  Writing for College, The Internet Classroom, or Introduction to Psychology.......  Let's see....  Writing for College:  I'll get to improve on the skills that I acquired from this year, it will help me if and when I go to School of the Arts, and I'll become a better writer all together.  However, the homework will be hell, and I'm not really a good writer in the first place, just an essay writer.  The Internet Classroom:  I would get to learn how to use html code and other various workings of the internet via the creation of my very own web page which I would then get to present at the end of the session.  Still, I already know a lot, and there has to be something ridiculously hard about this class.  Introduction to Psychology:  I would learn about the inner workings of human intelligence and behavior, which will allow me to help others and myself with depression (a useful trait at this age), and possibly manipulate people for my own sick twisted purposes!  However, I don't think I should have that power, there'll be LOTS of homework, and like Jhonen says, "A closer look at what's wrong with you might scare the shit out of you."  But I have a lot of time to decide.....  So I can relax now...  North Carolina here I come....

      Ok, I went past my 600 mark, I haven’t written anything interesting since my shmear on military calmatives, and the fans are getting antsy.    (Fans?)  With school coming up, I've been thinking about all the different crap that will be going on.  The classes, the teachers, the textbooks, and all we have to learn.  The teachers learn from the books, but who's to say the books aren't teaching them what they should?  So I started thinking...    Actually, I was just reading an article about textbooks in a media disinformation guide, but the other way makes me sound a lot more intelligent and thoughtful...  Just about everything we do in school revolves around what the textbook has to say.  Thanks to the virtual monopoly of public education, textbook publishers have a wide-ranging power to shape the ideas of kids like us.  In reality, textbooks do more to misinform and mislead than any other than any other print media.  Some of our most basic beliefs, even our view of America as a democracy, are shaped and distorted by school textbooks.  While this sounds completely ridiculous and has all the makings of a conspiracy that would rival Roswell, it will make more and less sense as you read on.  Looking at the areas of history, literature, and science, it's easy to see how textbooks fail (said the pubic school child).  First, history textbooks focus on names, dates, and places, rather than why it happened and the social and economic interests.  Second, literature textbooks give a censored and bland version of our literary heritage.  Third, science textbooks give a very detailed view of certain aspects and purposely shy away from larger concepts.  If you still don’t believe me, I don’t blame you, but at least join me in the utter confusion and hatred for Mel and Norma Gabler.  Mel and Norma Gabler, a married couple living in  Texas , are among some of the most influential in the textbook nation.  They've helped bring about the publishing, and the rejection, of 2/3 of America's textbooks.  The Gablers include in their guidelines for textbooks that these should "encourage loyalty" and avoid "defaming" the nations founders, and avoid material that might lead students to criticize his or her parents.  In one of Mel's creepiest statements, he criticized textbooks saying, "Too many textbooks and discussions leave students free to make up their mind about things."  So, in order to shut us up, we're bombarded with the memorization of factoids so were able to tell you who all the Civil War generals were, if we can point out Lexington on a map, or the date for the passage of amendments to the Constitution.  But we're never able to know  why  it's important to know why the Civil War started,  why  the Battle of Lexington took place, and  why  the amendments to the Constitution were necessary.  I could go on and on, but you'd stop reading right....               ......about.....               .....here.  So I'll just stop and say that I hope that someone with power catches on and makes a difference.  Just because were kids doesn't mean were stupid, and if we are, it's your fault.    Go America............ I pledge allegiance to the flag, and the United States of America.  And to the..... republic ???   For more on this weird crap and not just another plagiarism done by Nick Sanz-Gould, go to the  urlLink disinformation headquarters.

      I went to a party on Wednesday, it was so good, I just woke up....  That's bullshit, I was just too lazy to write anything else sooner....  It was a benefit for a place known as 826 Valencia, a pirate store with a writing class.  The whole thing is run by Dave Eggers, a well known writer who I've never heard of, but he'd make one hell of a pirate.  My dad and I found it during a stroll through the Mission, and when we looked inside, well, now I just sound like a 5 year old...  I'm going to write like a five year-old:  We sawed the place an it wuz nice. it made mee fell like a pirat on ship who had a parot. i never saw that many rops but the fish wer scary an the pepl wer to.  That's enough...  Anyway, the benefit was the event of the season, and from the very minute I walked in, I knew I didnt belong there.  May'be 100 well dressed people all with some creative knowledge of the art world and the social life within it gave me one awkward glance that pushed the hair down over my face for the rest of the night.  There was food, but not enough to go around for my family, so I skipped it.  For the next segment of my night, I was walking aimlessly around this social experiment of too many people with Buffalo Wing breath, in a small place, with bright lights on during a heat wave.  Chicken was coming out of everyone's pores and I was looking for a safe place to breathe.  Eventually, more lights went on for the presentation and we were all forced to stand in place for a story by an 11 year old (which wasnt as bad as I'm about to bitch about it) that brought a laugh to those with the worst breath, an article about monkeys by a 13 year old, and a bunch of really good poetry by some other teenagers.  During it all, I grew tired of being level with the stench and my legs hurt, so I decided to crouch.  During my time on the ground, I discovered that someone had dropped a LOT of pills.  Here's my thought on that:  Someone was bored, and saw their ex-girlfriend.  In an effort to get her back, if only for a night, he tried to sneak a ruffie into her drink.  The presentation was about to begin, so everyone turned to look at the stage, and he dropped all the pills.  I think someone had some, because a few were gone a bit later.  All in all, I'm not sure why I was there, but it was the most exclusive party I ever didnt pay attention to.

      TV hit a new low.  Last night, as I was cruising through all the news, wholesome family networks, and infomercials, I landed upon MTV (Give me a break, I'm 13).  It was the premiere of the Real World Movie...  First, lets think about those words alone: The Real World is a show just about "real" people living in a city, in a huge house, with lots of money, an important job, and cameras all around......  What the hell is real about that?  Anyway, the Movie is a fake show about a fake "real" life.  I was thinking about this late at night for about 3 hours...  I think I'm the only person who's ever survived a triple aneurysm.  The entire concept is scary and forced, but eventually, it gets better.  Some of them die...  Besides MTV sending this generation into a void of marketing schemes and the same old songs over and over, my remaining gripes (because I'm such a happy person...) are with Nickelodeon, PAX, about all the talk shows, HBO, Fox, NBC, MSNBC, and by now you can tell that I've been watching too much TV......  I should go do something....

      Is it just me, or are video games getting more and more realistic and pro-American?    There actually is something so creepy that it sounds like a conspiratory, when it isn't, in your video games.  It's known as the Military-Nintendo complex.  Various game companies have collaborated with military officials to create the most violent, brainwashing (I couldn't think of a better word), addictive, and entertaining games around.  They can bend the truth very far, but can never ever say anything bad about America, its government, or anything it's done.  Companies have had their people go on previously secret aircraft carriers and submarines to take information on engines, weaponry, exits, and every nook and cranny.  What would get a spy hanged for espionage is now keeping war at the fingertips of millions of glassy-eyed kids sitting at their computer in a dark room.  (Gee, that sounds familiar........)  For example:  SWAT 3: Tactical Game of the Year - Takes place in Los Angeles in 2005, yet this country still has the zeal that we did from post-9/11 and everyone in LA has a heavy Southern accent.  All the enemies are communist radicals.  There's something else about this game that's unusual, but I can't quite put my finger on it.  Besides that, the game is the violent, realistic, and ridiculous.  Soldier of Fortune:   " The hunter becomes the hunted... You’re the world’s deadliest Soldier of Fortune and your mission is clear: survive. Track your prey across the globe in a series of secret missions to take down a fanatical terrorist organization... before it takes you down. Maintain your cover as a covert warrior in a startling variety of explosive missions - ranging from underhanded sabotage, to stealthy assassination, to full frontal assaults - where skill marks the difference between the hunter and the hunted. Welcome to the secret world of mercenary combat.  Based on the popular mercenary magazine of the same name, Soldier of Fortune is a hard-core action first-person shooter, based on a heavily modified Quake II engine, featuring Raven’s own state-of-the-art GHOUL rendering system. Soldier of Fortune immerses the player in a fast-paced, story-driven roller coaster ride, from beginning to end. "  I don't even need to tell you about that one, that's just fucked up by itself...  Some of you may be thinking, "Now Nick, what's all this nonsense with brainwashing???  They're just games, you silly little conspirator  :D"(And if that voice you heard that from was as sweet as the one in my head, you'd be sick, too.) I'd say, "GET IN THE CAGE, MONKEY....  NOW....  NO, QUIET!!! NO...   NO  "  Then, I'd calmly tell you that the game Wolfenstein 3D has been clinically tested for increasing "aggressive tendencies."  I'm not denying how much fun these can be; I'm just a little scared.  In all the games that I've seen like this, the guy you play as (because the women must be too smart to fall into this mercenary shit...) always seems to have a Southern accent...  Will the South rise and crush the United States with its superior gaming knowledge, increased aggressiveness, and weaponry designed by GT Interactive???  Find out more when Nick feels inspired, only at www.personal_hell.blogspot.com:  Your one stop shop for plagiarism...  Note: Nick, in no way, has anything  against  the South (except slavery, the Klu Klux Klan, and country music) and in no way believes that people in the southern part of America are bad people, they just have a bad reputation.  Nick hopes the South and him can party once they get rid of the KKK, all the confederate flags flying around, and Kid Rock...  Thank you...  Go America......  A simulation game brought to you by Raven Software, GT Interactive, and Activison.  In stores now.

      You guys.........  I'm in North Carolina..... Not wimpy little South Carolina, NORTH Carolina.  I'm getting used to the South, I haven't seen that many Confederate flags (if you count a Confederate boogie board I saw...).  The people are really nice, I haven't heard any country music (but I have gained respect for some of it), and I have yet to burn my lily-white ass...  All in all, I'm having a great time.  It's just so hot that I don't have much patience to write, and blogger's publishing is down...  Go America.......You know, I wouldn't really consider North Carolina to be the south if it didn't have the Confederate flag, and if it did have a wider racial spectrum...

      Kurt's Suicide Note...   To boddah, Speaking from the tongue of an experienced simpleton who obviously would rather be an emasculated, infantile complain-ee. This note should be pretty easy to understand. All the warnings from the punk rock 101 courses over the years, since my first introduction to the, shall we say, ethics involved with independence and the embracement of your community has proven to be very true. I haven't felt the excitement of listening to as well as creating music along with reading and writing for too many years now. I feel guilty beyond words about these things. For example when we're backstage and the lights go out and the manic roar of the crowd begins, it doesn't affect me the way in which it did for freddy mercury, who seemed to love it, relish in the love and adoration from the crowd, which is something I totally admire and envy. The fact is, I can't fool you, any of you. It simply isn't fair to you or me. The worst crime I can think of would be to rip people off by faking it and pretending as if I'm having 100% fun. Sometimes I feel as if I should have a punch-in time clock before I walk out on stage- I've tried everything within my power to appreciate it (and I do, god believe me I do, but it's not enough). I appreciate the fact that I and we have affected and entertained a lot of people. I must be one of those narcissists who only appreciate things when they're gone. I'm too sensitive. I need to be slightly numb in order to regain the enthusiasm I once had as a child. On our last 3 tours, I've had a much better appreciation for all the people I've known personally and as fans of our music, but I still can't get over the frustration, the guilt and empathy I have for everyone. There's good in all of us and I think I simply love people too much, so much that it makes me feel too fucking sad. The sad little sensitive, unappreciative, pisces, jesus man. Why don't you just enjoy it? I don't know! I have a goddess of a wife who sweats ambition and empathy and a daughter who reminds me too much of what I use to be, full of love and joy, kissing every person she meets because everyone is good and will do her no harm. And that terrifies me to the point where I can barely function. I can't stand the thought of frances becoming the miserable, self-destructive, death rocker that I've become. I have it good, very good, and I'm grateful, but since the age of seven, I've become hateful to all humans in general. Only because it seems so easy for people to get along and have empathy. Empathy! Only because I love and feel sorry for people too much I guess. Thank you all from the pit of my burning, nauseous stomach for your letters and concern during the past years. I'm too much of an erratic, moody, baby! I don't have the passion anymore, and so remember, it's better to burn out then to fade away.  Peace, love, empathy Kurt Cobain   Frances and Courtney, I'll be at your altar. Please keep going Courtney, for Frances. For her life, which will be so much happier without me. I LOVE YOU, I LOVE YOU.

      I'm back in San Francisco, and as usual, I have nothing to write as interesting as my junk on the Military-Nintendo complex, so here's what I'm gonna do........   Nick's List of Shampoo that Hurts to Get in Your Eye   10. Johnson & Johnson: That no tears crap doesn't fool me... 9. Neutrogena: Well, at least my retina doesn’t have acne... 8. Got 2 B: Got 2 Blind yo ass.... 7. Pantene Pro-V: Imagine putting shoe polish on the inside of your eyelid and blinking like your having an epileptic seizure.  For an eye so healthy, it shines... 6. Suave:  You can see it in the back of your head.  All your brain cells rush away and split your skull in two. 5. L’Oreal:  I'm not sure how, but when it hits your right eye, it goes to your left one, too.... I think they make it for your eyelashes, the peak of bad ideas.   4: Hydrology: This is supposed to add moisture to your hair, so when it hits your eye, you choke as it becomes so moist that it slips out of your eye socket and down your throat... 3. Pert Plus: I know it's old, but it still feels like you have Windex, lighter fluid, and some whiskey in your eye. 2. Herbal Essences: Despite their orgasmic commercials, it won't make your eye feel like that.   All the herbs of the Amazon rainforest put together  with mind dumbing chemicals and probably a bit of the date-rape drug  to give you a nice clean feeling.   Blame it on Dr. Ruth... 1. Head and Shoulders:  All anti-dandruff shampoos are designed to get rid-of dead cells.  Unfortunately, they end up killing some live cells as well.  When you get this in your eye, it makes you see through time.  It blinds you for at least 2 hours by traveling to the back of your head, detaching your retina, and turning your eye into a cherry bomb with a lighted fuse...  ...and that's how I feel...

      Recently, in school, I've been questioning a lot.  First off, the people who write the books for science experiments:     Everything I've seen so far is Math + Science.  What happened to the good old days of volcanos and surprsies?  Next, social status:     It doesnt seem to have any affect at all.  Whoever you were before means nothing now as you are remembered by 6th and 7th grade.  Last, relationships:     I've been noticing these a lot.  You may be thinking to yourself, "Gee, Nick must be really lonely now.  So he's spying on other people."  But I've got 80 years to go before I start to be the horny old man hiding in the bushes asking you and your girlfriend to kiss.  Anyway, nowadays, I've been finding them a lot more funny than usual.  All the flirting, all the staring, and all the ignorance.  When everything ends (and they always do) the people act dead.  We constantly forget, WE'RE KIDS!  I blame it on school, to be honest.  We're treated like children for most of life, until we get to middle school.  Then we get shocked into adulthood and it has an effect on EVERYTHING.  Just my feelings on a few things, no real purpose.  I just had 900 something hits I didnt deserve.  Go America..................  BOO

      Today is the first day of the rest of my life....  It's my first day in school, and already, you can see that the endless process of memorization is upon us (read the thing I said about school textbooks).  Over the next couple weeks, I'll have to memorize the Gettysburg Address, numerous chemicals of the periodic table, The Declaration of Independence, most---if not all---of the Amendments, and about more memorization then I can already remember.  Being a pessimist is a tough job, but someone has to bring down all the joy of those damn happy people.   Go America...........May Grey Davis burn in Hell...

      I have school tomorrow.   Not to sound like a bitching, little shmuck, but I'm about to GOD DAMNIT!  WHOLE SUMMER, GONE, JUST GONE... SHOOT ME!  This entire summer was focused on about 4 different things: 1. Writing 2. Depression 3. Family 4. Katie (You'd have to ask me about it in person)  So at this point, along with all the other kids in this city, I'll take the longest walk of my life (except for death row...) to the bus stop and wait in front of poisonous Nightshade plants for the bus that will carry me to the mental prison of censorship and sadness.  Sorry, too bleak.  Let me try again:   "Gee golly!  We get to go back to school! YAY!  I can’t wait to start learning with all those warm, happy, loving teachers!  Just waiting for the bus will fill me with such anticipation that I wont be able to keep an ear-to-ear grin off my face!"   And that's why you shouldn’t take ecstasy...

      My grandma is....  Well, decent for the time being, but let's not dwell on that now, shall we?  I haven't added anything recently that brought the feeling of "Wow, that shit is WEIRD!" for a long while.  This post isn't anything like that either.  Here's my small gripe (I just have so gosh darn many...)  I recently recieved word that I was to be interviewed for our  urlLink school newspaper  (the one I wanted to work on) for an article about blogs.  The blog was to be done by Connie and Joe.  I, and some others were to be questioned and have our URLs added to a list in the paper.  My blog, and  urlLink Joe's , have parental guidence warnings next to them.  Needless to say, otherwise this wouldn't be a gripe,  urlLink Connie's blog  doesn't.   Wait, I'm sorry, gripe wasn't the word I wanted...  Ah, it was gratitude.  Nothing says "COME HERE DAMNIT!" like a parental warning sign (being such a threatening thing) published in a school newspaper (being such a censored thing) next to your name with a link.  I'll do my best to bring you the writing that so needs a parental warning.  All the words, insults, opinions, and brutal daydreams will spew forth and absorb you, like no other has before (empty promises).  Thank you, brave censors of Hoover. Thank you Ms. Pon. Thank you irony. And I'll stop before this sounds like an Alanis Morrisette song.

      My grandma is in the hospital.  In case you didn’t know about her in the first place, I'll fill you in.  The rest of you skip this part.  She was a big smoker; even when I was little I remembered her smoking.  The cigarettes led to cancer (as they always do) and hospitalization.  She stopped smoking, but she didn’t get that much better.  She came to stay at our house for a while before going to a nursing home.  She eventually came back and has stayed ever since.  Her condition wavered.  If I missed anything, my parents will probably correct me.  Expect a change in this post.    Right now: She can't walk.  She hasn’t been eating or drinking anything for a while.  When she does, it makes her throw up.  She's just been sleeping.  My aunt (a doctor) came over to look at her.  The verdict was that she wouldn’t have very long.  Now she's in the hospital to find out what we could do.  Chances are, she'll need 24 hour help and won’t be able to get out of bed.  She is going to die here.  It's what she want, it's what my parents want, and it's what I want.  I never noticed how barren this house is.

      "What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal."   --Albert Pike  Quotes, always a way to start something...  My grandma died just now.  Don’t worry, don’t be upset, and don’t say anything.  Just let it go.  For you reading this now, I'll see you tomorrow, talk to you on the net, or anything of the sort.  I'll be the guy making jokes to his friends.  She went slowly, without any struggle. She had friends and family around, crying, comforting, reminiscing, and making jokes to change the mood.  I said I would start worrying when my grandma stopped criticizing people, and I don’t think she stopped.  She was probably still looking at us, just laughing at the singing, telling my mom to stop the music, and telling me to cut my hair.    I just looked at it all.  I watched my family crying, I heard vague whimpers; inaudible, but present.  No one feels extremely bad.  We're all upset, we all miss her, but we felt ok about it.  I know I'll see her again, I'm positive I will.  With my grandpa, and my aunt Judy, and anyone else from my family.  I'll be the guy making jokes.  Good night everyone, and seriously, whoever you are reading this, thanks.  Thanks for taking the time to know me and read my stuff and help me out.

      My grandma's obituary was in the paper this morning:    SANZ, LaVerne V.   SANZ, LaVerne V. - Departed this life near midnight September 9th. Preceded in death by Joseph and Judith, her loving husband and daughter, she is survived by daughters Janice and Joyce, sons-in-law Mark, Allan, and Max, grandchildren Parris, Dominique, Savonna, Jared and Nicholas, and dear nieces Amelia and Nancy. Many other close & loving relatives, too numerous to mention know her love. We will all miss her heart & crusty charm. We thank Hogan Sullivan & Bianco for their kindness.

      Can I be truly honest with you people?  Seriously?  Let me just say: I love my grandparents.  Always have, always will.   But Hell hath no fury like a Jewish grandpa…  Every year, my Jewish grandparents come from Florida (what a surprise!) to stay in my uncle Bob’s house.  While they’re here, my dad and I visit them as frequently as possible.  It’s a long walk from my house to my uncle’s, but I never mind it.  It gives me time to brace myself, and joke with my dad about past experiences with his parents.  We get to the house and walk down a strip of cement past the various plants my aunt and uncle have put in over the years.  Just before we get to the door, we can see inside the window where my grandparents sit, watching TV, trying to make sense of Joe Rogan as he abuses people on Fear Factor (but that’s a whole another post).  My dad fakes blowing them away with machine guns, as they look on, oblivious to our laughing.  I could swear they know what he’s doing and they make fun of him when we leave.  We step inside, give them ice cream (if we don’t they sacrifice children…I used to have 2 sisters), hug them, and move into the kitchen to put the ice cream away.  My grandpa comes in behind me, talks to me, talks about how big I’ve been getting and how I better gain some more weight, and starts off into any random story you can imagine.  It doesn’t follow that pattern always, I’ve never ever been able to pinpoint where he moves into the death trap.  Like a ninja he moves in and engulfs me in a story that ranges anywhere from God to Fidel Castro.  His stories do to your mind what 8 shots of heroin, 5 doses of Nyquil, and a punch the face from Mr. T could only do on Mardi Gras.  It’s never a story that has an end either.  He can go from the birth of Christ, to World War 2, to Fidel Castro, to Hawaii, back to Christ, to the British, to Germany, back to World War 2, to World War 1, to the Civil War, to the Indians, to textile, to cotton, to Cuba, to Fidel Castro again, to slavery, to South Africa, to Jesus when he was older, to slavery, to World War 2 again, he stays there……..Stays there some more……Just a little bit longer…….  Then, he goes to Iraq, to Japan, to Hawaii, to the Bronx, to the Revolutionary War, to the life of Christ, to World War 2, and his entire family and life in connection with everything said.  Here’s the scary part:  I never see or hear when, where, or how he changes subjects.  Ever.  For the last 2 years I’ve been searching for where he changes his subject and continues on something else.  Recently, I’ve just given up.  I’ve trained myself to nod every 6 seconds while sleeping with my eyes open.  I plan to record him talking and put his voice to a techno mix.  Millions will overdose on ecstasy while listening to tales of my grandpa’s time in the Army Postal Service.  The usual pulsing beat of a car with it’s stereo turned up will be replaced by a booming voice of, “…then in 1946, when I was just winding down from my job in Brooklyn…” And a new techno will rise.  There will be a trend of people adding the weirdest things imaginable to techno.  (In a much more explicit version of this post, I list different possibilities.)  As the undisputed old-school Godfather of this trend, I will cower in my house, slowly going mad at the wave of idiocy that I caused by a simple joke listed in a weblog like this one.

      I'm dreadfully sorry everyone.  I haven't written anything in such a long while and you've all been coming here and looking day after day (right?).  As you'll see in every other blog by kids from my school, we're all busy as hell.  Eighth grade is not a kind year.  We have to keep up with national standards, get ready for high school, get in everything necessary for graduation, take numerous tests, and all the while we're fighting off the collapsing walls of our social lives....  Don't ask...  I promise you I'll have something soon.  Please, stand by this bullshit.  I need you people.  You are the blood and soul of this blog and all it makes...  I've been watching too many early morning preachers...  Trust me on this one: Stay the hell away from Pat Robertson.  He's 5 steps away from George Bush, and only 2 genes away from a spider monkey...

      An excerpt from the book  Brave New World :          “One of the numerous things in heaven and earth that these philosophers didn’t dream about was this” (he waved his hand), “us, the modern world. ‘You can only be independent of God while you’ve got youth and prosperity; independence won’t take you safely to the end.’  Well, we’ve now got youth and prosperity right up to the end.  What follows?  Evidently, that we can be independent of God.  ‘The religious sentiment will compensate us for all our losses.’  But there aren’t any losses for us to compensate; religious sentiment is superfluous.  And why should we go hunting for a substitute for youthful desires when youthful desires never fail?  A substitute for distractions, when we go on enjoying all the old fooleries to the very last?  What need have we of repose when our minds and bodies continue to delight in activity?  of consolation, when we have soma? of something immovable, when there is social order?”                                                                                         --Mustapha Mond, to the Savage                               I love this quote...  I really do.         First off, I'm aware of how long it's been since I've posted anything on this blog, and I'm honestly sorry.  I really want to keep up on this, but I'm lazy and overworked and those two never go together well...         Anyway, I believe many things about this quote.  You barely ever (if never) see philosophers question the power of God in the future.  But if by some chance we had the power to keep youth and prosperity, our need for God as a source of guidance and comfort would be an archaic concept.  It seems to me that God is only a personification of fate.  He is the variable of society and the reason for everything that happens from birth to aging to death.  So if we gain control of fate (keep in mind that such is impossible and I’m speaking from a hypothetical point of view in reflection with the book) then God makes no difference and there is no God to pray for.  People can enjoy the frivolities of life in a blissful stupor, free of worry.  Of course, as in the book Brave New World, psychological conditioning and brainwashing would have to be induced upon humanity at an early age for a life without fate life to work.  But then again, we’re not too far from that now, are we?         Still, it lingers within my mind that the controllers of such fate would be considered gods and thus ruining the whole point of eliminating God anyway.         I'm not trying to destroy God, or even hint at such.  I just find this one quote amazing.  Brave New World was written in the 1930s!  The fact that it's philosophy holds true today amazes me.  Go America....  Chthonic lifestyles are only the beginning.

      You'll see this in some other weblogs of Hoover middle school, but I must say what I must.  (On a separate note, if you're still visiting this blog after the long pause of creativity, I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  I hope to address the matter in Iraq as soon as I can gather enough information to not sound as ignorant about this whole matter as I really am.  I'll have to start doing my research on the Gulf War, oil, Saddam, Gulf War Syndrome, and the entire Middle East in history.  But as this next post will show you, I wouldn't have the time to even learn to spell some of the names I should know in Iraq.)  Every year, the all the children in all the middle schools in San Francisco (and God knows where else) go to an assembly.  The stage is decorated in disco lights, scooters, mini bikes, coolers, little useless trinkets, magazine cover shots, an oversized picture of Austin Powers in his classic "Oh, behave" pose, and a gigantic money booth.  An over-enthusiastic representative enters stage left.  This guy has all the zeal of a baby seal suicide bomber with his headset microphone, fast-talking, speedy movements, and cheesy jokes and mind games. The first two words that come out of his mouth:  " Magazine drive... "  The brainchild of Reader's Digest rears its ugly head again to put thousands of prize hungry children to work.  The "family" of the child selects from hundreds of magazines, books, CDs, and toys.  The "parents" (as in anyone the kid can find, regardless if they're a murderer or child molester) sign a number of copies of sheets, the kids add in the necessary information and give it to a school official the next morning for prizes.  Every two tickets (tickets being the orders from the molester-- I'm sorry, "parents") is a different level for prizes.   The levels and prizes are too numerous to mention, but out of all the crap the representative feeds us, no prize is so diabolical as the 2-ticket "weepole" (spelling suggestions welcome, no one can actually spell that).  It's a fucking fuzz ball glued to feet and googly eyes, and every year, they have new ones.  I thought I had seen the worst they had to offer, but this year, they introduced Patriot Weepole.  You heard me...   Patriot .........  Weepole .........  Let the shock run over you just a bit...  It'll take some time... I'm here for you, don’t worry...  It's a purple piece of lint with googly eyes and a big ol' American flag.  I'm quite grateful that the body is purple, if it were white, I would instantly smell something wrong.  I was already sick of the American flags everywhere you turn, and when I had thought I was safe and the country was going back to hating our president, here comes a piece of fuzz telling me the exact opposite. And it wasn't so much the fact that it was there, or the fact that 85% of the audience applauded their hearts out at the site of it, it was that the first thought I had was of  the slave labor put into each and every one of these things .  I know that volunteers probably made the weepoles (please, let it be so), but I can't help but think about that.  The presentation was over and the happy mob left with their information packets.   I'm aware of how much this helps the school, and how Readers Digest was being generous to us, but I can't get over how scary this all is.  I hope one day they all (I don’t mean to ride in on my high horse, I'm a huge sucker) wake up and laugh at how stupid we were for going out into the world with pamphlets in hand an prizes in mind just like little Jehovah's Witnesses.  All I can really say is that this is the final stage in brainwashing the fresh 6th graders.  Go America.....  We'll read as long as it involves prizes.....

      It's been months......  Countless months.........("Nick?  You can't count to two???")  If anyone still reads any of this, s/he should seek professional help (hookers).  On a much lighter note, we're all (me and the janitor) still braindead (tired, hungry, able to fuck watermelon).  The last thing I can remember from this week is something about a science project... I didn't have any ideas, I got an idea from a friend, the teacher (Mr. Cunningham) didn't like it, and now I'm back to square one.  All the good ideas involve mass quantities of chemicals, petri dishes, incubators, plants, and the focus that I just don't have.  My (not really mine) idea you ask?  Sunscreen testing... You put different types of sunscreen on those glow-in-the-dark stars (I'm 13, how else would I measure light?) and introducing the sunscreen to different conditions. If you know me, you know how pale I am.  So sunscreen is just about the most ironic thing I could do. It's like if one of the most innocent and concentrated kids in my class (let's say Jesse) did a project on how fast you could hotbox a squirrel with different types of weed...  Actually, that might work... Get a bad grade, blow smoke in the teacher's face, get a good grade, teacher gets high, teacher gets hungry, give the teacher some Fritos, get first prize.  I'm better off testing how long it takes me to get offered pot on Haight st when I put different looks on my face. Again, weed in the teacher's face, I win...  (I'm going too far on a marijuana tangent, forget everything I've said up to this point.)

      A train from LA leaves the station at 4:30pm Pacific Time going at 190mph.  Another train from Boston and another from Hartford both leave at 4:30 Eastern/Central time going 150mph.  400 passengers are on the Boston train, 500 on the LA train, and 200 on the Hartford train.  The trains will all intersect and crash in the middle of the US in one of 7 different cities and the news will cover it.  Each cities population determines the level of coverage.  What time will the trains crash, in what city, how much news coverage will there be, and who's hotter: Dan Rathers or Stone Philips?

      Oy gevalt... So you all voted nay to my proposition. Well, you're the oyrech who will have to visit this place and read the same post about Stone Philips over and over again.  On a separate note, and since the word oyrech may have disturbed you to some extent, I shall tell you an old Yiddish fable/joke.  Before I continue with this, I'll cover the essentials.  oyrech: guest shtetl: little town Shabbes: Sabbath  Mr. Ostrovsky, a traveling salesman, found himself in the synagogue in a little shtetl in Galica one Friday night.  After the prayers, as the Jews turned right, turned left, in the traditional manner, smiling, shaking hands, uttering the "Gut Shabbes" greeting, Mr. Ostrovsky, sighing and melancholy, set off in search of a place to sleep. "Where are you going?" exclaimed a man.  "A Jew, alone, on Shabbes?  Come, man.  Come home with me!  have dinner in my house, spend the night with us.  No, no; no excuses!  My name is Glantz.  Come along.  My wife is a marvelous cook, and you'll have a dinner you'll never forget!" Off went the grateful Ostrovsky with his exuberant host. Mr. Glantz's promises were not empty:  No host and hostess could have been warmer, kinder, more considerate.  Ostrovsky was given a fine bedroom, urged to soak in a hot tub, given fluffy towels and scented soap--and fed a superlative dinner.  He slept, that night, between fine linen sheets, and next morning ate a sumptuous breakfast. As he made his heart felt farewells to his host, Ostrovsky said, "How can I ever thank you?" Said his host, "Just attent to this." And Glantz handed Ostrovsky a piece of paper.  The incredulous Ostrovsky read:  1 bath hot water.......................10 kopecks 1 cake scented soap................20 kopecks 1 large towel............................10 kopecks 1 sabbath dinner (complete)..... 2.50 rubles 2 fresh sheets..........................20 kopecks 1 fresh pillow case....................10 kopecks 1 breakfast...............................75 kopecks                     TOTAL 3.95 rubles  "But--what's this?" asked Ostrovsky. "Your bill," said Glantz "You expect me to  pay  this?!" "Certainly," said Glantz.  "Are you denying that you bathed here, slept here, ate like a king---" "Deny it?  I'm flabbergasted!" exclaimed Ostrovsky.  "You  invited  me here!  You  asked  me to be your Shabbes oyrech!  I've never heard a more outrageous---" "Stop!" Glantz held up his hand peremptorily.  Let's not argue, my friend.  Will you agree to come to our rabbi and tell him everything, and abide by his decision?" "Will I?" cried Ostrovsky.  "I can't  wait  to hear what the rabbi tells you about such disgusting behavior!"  Off went the two men to the rabbi, who, seeing their expressions, said, "Well, my friends, what happened so to spoil your Sabbath?" Ostrovsky told his tale to the rabbi, pouring out the words with fervor. The rabbi turned to Glantz.  "And what do you, the host, have to say?" "Nothing," said Glantz.  "Everything he said is accurate, just as it happened." "There you are rabbi!" cried Ostrovsky.  "You see?" The rabbi nodded.  "After hearing you both, and considering all the delicate ethical problems involved, and based on the wisdom--on just such problems--I have studied for years in the Talmud, my decision is clear: Ostrovsky, pay the bill."  With a heavy heart, Ostrovsky sighed, "Very well." Ostrovsky and his host left the rabbi's house, and Ostrovsky started to count out money. "What are you doing?" asked Glantz. "Paying your bill," said Ostrovsky. "Paying me?  For my hospitality?  You must be crazy.  Do you think I would accept money from you, my honored guest, my oyrech auf Shabbes?" Ostrovsky sputtered:  "You gave me the bill!!  You asked for money!!!  YOU made me come here!  You---" "Oh, that," scoffed Glantz.  "I just wanted you to see what a dope we have here for a rabbi."

       Tiny Tim  " Best recognized for his wild dyed red hair, flashy style of dress, and his faithful ukulele, Tiny Tim is one of the best known entertainers from the 1960's.  His most famous song, "Tip Toe Thru the Tulips with Me" was one of the top 40 hits of 1968. In 1968 and 1969, Tiny was a regular in the Johnny Carson show, on which he even got married. That wedding appearance on the "Tonight Show" marked Tiny's most popular moment, with 40 million viewers watching him tie the knot with 17-year-old Miss Vicki (Victoria May Budinger) on the night of December 17, 1969. Several concerts, tours, and television appearances followed the wedding broadcast. The couple had one daughter, Tulip, and was later divorced. "  Now what more can you say about a man who has lived such a full and amazing life? A legend of music. An idol to some. Why, he could be one of the greatest minds of MY generation!  Maybe he...         Um, ok.        (I really don't have anything against him, I just think this is a really unflattering picture and someone should get revenge on the photographer)

      So, I got rejected from SOTA. The one place I had my heart set on. A haven of psychological relaxation. And I got rejected.  Before I say any more about this, let's just look at the irony of how I'm  now  writing in my blog: 1. Most of the entries in my portfolio were blog entries, which probably sabotaged my chances of getting in.  2. I chose to write in my weblog after having the feeling of rejection that brings the words, "I'll never write again in my life, ever, as long as I live."  So, as I can't help but laugh at the irony itself, there's just this pitted feeling.  Of course, you didn't come here to listen to me bitch, you came for humor and cynicism... Let me just say that they REALLY should specifically tell me what was wrong with my audition and portfolio so I could have a better chance for when the next audition comes around, otherwise I could end up exacerbating what was wrong with my portfolio and repeating this process.  Now you see how coming here to listen to me bitch is starting to make sense, eh?  But like I said, it feels weird, kind of like this:    ...mixed with...    ...sprinkle in a little:   ...about 2 lbs of...    ...and blend well to get...    But not nearly as pretty as all of that...

      Before I begin with this, you should know that my advice is not always the best to follow, but I just can't let this go unheard.  I'll just be straightforward with this... 'Darkness Falls' is the worst horror film I've seen in my short life, and I've seen both 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'I Still Know What You Did Last Summer'.  To avoid typing because of my poor dexterity, I'll just copy and paste the summary plot from some movie site:   "A young man (Chaney Kley) fears that an evil spirit lurks in his small town taking on the form of the Tooth Fairy, but no one believes him except his childhood girlfriend (Emma Caulfield) and her younger brother, who may turn out to be the spirit’s next victim."   Ok, you know what?  That didn't really work, here's a better one:   "For the past 150 years, the legend of Matilda Dixon, the Tooth Fairy, has hung over the town of Darkness Falls like a dark cloud. After being unjustly accused of a heinous crime, the kindly old woman was savagely slaughtered by a mad rabble one night, and there are those who say her vengeful spirit hovers over the town, just waiting to pounce on anyone who sees her in the dark. It happened to young Kyle. One night he saw Matilda and, though he managed to escape her evil clutches, his mother was brutally murdered. Or was it just a hallucination? Haunted by his painful memories of that night, Kyle has never allowed himself to be in the dark since. One day, he is summoned back to town by his childhood sweetheart Caitlin, whose nine-year-old brother Michael is having the same nightmares that drove Kyle to the brink of madness. When he returns, however Kyle realizes Matilda's evil spirit was no figment of his imagination. She is real and extremely dangerous. And if she catches him in the dark again, her horrible, scarred face will be the last thing he ever sees."   (So far I've barely had to write a thing.  That's what most of this blog is, lots of stolen material pasted and italicized in order to make it look like I've been writing a lot and spend all my thought and dedication here because no one ever reads the dates on these things.  I do this because I can.)  This movie seemed like it had a good plot, it had various quirks that fit with the story and it unraveled in an interesting manner.  However, it, of course, had a lot of problems (said the overly-dramatic teenager standing on a soapbox).  First off, let's start with the sound. It seemed like when we were first learning about the Tooth Fairy entity, it emited different sounds.  The sounds you ask? It resembled if someone had dropped a microphone inside a large, saucy vat of Kraft Mac&Cheese and stirred at different speeds.  Later in the movie, the Tooth Fairy's screeching was nothing more than stolen tapes of the raptors from Jurassic Park.  Next, the Tooth Fairy itself just seemed like a piñata with talons, covered in ash, and given fighting lessons from Gary Coleman.  (By the way, I'm really getting tired of typing the words "Tooth Fairy" so from here on out, I'm copying and pasting.  Just thought you should know.)  Now, everytime the Tooth Fairy (See?  Copy and paste) attacked anyone, they were, of course, in the dark, and had a flashlight pointing in the wrong direction.  Hence, when she wrestled them to the ground, it resulted in a horrible fight in the dark. Sure, this is necessary for the feelings of panic and fear, but they just went overboard.  They would show a really quick flash, followed by a shot of some veins, claws, blood, more veins, and BAM!  The flashlight hits the camera and the audience goes blind for the rest of the sequence.  Repeat that 2 more times in that sequence alone, and 30 more times throughout the rest of the movie and the seizures just come running wild.  Further gripes will be posted at a later time, until then, here's a preview: Actors - Had no idea what they were doing, very little character development, and no sign of epiphany or help.  They were running blind.

      Somethings I just don't understand... There are plenty of horrible, evil, and malicious people all around the world that deserved to die, so why would a wonderfully kind person die? That's right, I'm talking about Mr. Rogers.  A man whose only crime was lying to kids about fitting in that tiny trolley to get to where ever he wanted... was taken from us. And for some reason I specifically remember an episode where he went on a tour of a toilet bowl factory, and recall saying to myself, "Oh man, he must be desperate," but then I realized...  This is what kids want.  Toilet jokes.  Of course, there'll be re-runs, but for how long? It pains me to think that future generations won't grow up seeing him come in and take off his sweater and sit down and travel on a trolley and talk to puppets and feed his fish and learn about stuff completely irrelevant to anything he was talking about before.  I never thought I would, but I'm really going to miss him.

      Yeah, I know...  I know. I said I would say more about Darkness Falls, but that would just be a tad superfluous.  And after all the Mr. Rogers stuff, how could I go back to bitching about bad movies?  Now, I'm not writing this little blurb because I actually have something to express, I'm doing this because I'm listening to the Pulp Fiction soundtrack. And anything you do is instantly fourty times cooler when listening to Misirlou by Dick Dale.  So here we go again people, I'm resorting to writing about my day:  I've been listening to the Pulp Fiction soundtrack way too much, and stuck in my head through the day.  Redundant surfing music was playing even as the walkout died over the PA system.  Teachers and counselors guarded the exits and all I could think of was how Dick Dale had such nimble fingers.    That's enough.  Anyway, if you haven't heard the news already, then this'll come fast, hard, and ridiculous. (Furthermore, it would be most saddening for you to have the epiphany that you can count the low-budget journal of a thirteen-year-old as one of your news sources.)  A man in Albany was arrested in a mall for wearing a shirt that said, "Peace on Earth" and "Give Peace a Chance".   Two men (father, 61, and son 31) were wearing the shirts  MADE  in a store in the mall, and were asked to either remove the shirts or leave.  The son complied and took his shirt off, but the father refused to and was arrested.  I know, I know. It's horrid.  There are an infinate amount of things more offensive than "Peace on Earth", and some of them were probably being worn in the mall.  Yet for some reason unbeknownst to myself, the mall security asked them to leave the premises because of their shirts.  On the brighter side of it, it's funny as hell.

      I won't even have some cutesy, cynical introduction to it this time.   Freedom Fries   Now, for the masses that know what I'm talking about here, you just sit tight.  The rest of you, follow me.  We all know that France is against the war (Yay!), and we also know that the percentage of Americans who are pro-war (which is an unfortunately large amount) are angered at France for their position on the war.  I would hope that we're all aware of the food item known as "french fries", julienne pieces of potato, deep-fried and commonly served with a meal consisting of burgers or hot dogs (in any form of meat and/or batter).  Well, a restaurant in Washington D.C. decided to change " french  fries" to "  freedom   fries" because whoever felt angered at the French enough to go so far as to change a beloved side dish to an American advertisement for the war.  And I ask, what are we, four?  As if the American people haven't embarrassed ourselves enough in the past years, this makes us look pathetically juvenile (and this is coming from a guy who still watches cartoons on a regular basis).  I didn't mean to project my opinion so harshly, I was merely venting, and I invite all those reading this to press the "Give me shit" button (I really should change it back to "Contact") and give me your opinion, as well as anything I may have missed on the subject.  Thanks in advance.

      If you give a moose a muffin, then he'll ask for some milk. When you give him some milk, he'll ask for a straw. When you give him a straw, he'll want a long, fancy straw with a few loops in it. When you give him the fancy straw, he'll ask where you got it, and you'll say a bodega, and naturally, he'll want to go. When you get to the bodega, he'll probably want some weed. When you give him the weed, he'll probably get the munchies. And when you give a moose the munchies, he'll probably ask for a muffin.

I've been storing up plenty of writing material, and it's almost the first year anniversary of this blog, so expect something soon.    Now all I have to do is get people reading this thing again...That's going to be quite an endavor, eh?

      Tests were conducted in which two year old children were asked questions about every thing.  One of the questions asked was: "Do you have a brother?" "Yes" "What's his name?" "Jim" "Does Jim have a brother?" "No"  This is called egocentrism.  Children four and under, as well as autistic children, often seem not to appreciate other's mental states.

      Oh my God, they've ruined Blogger. I  so  did not need this.  I know I was supposed to have a "clip show" for the first year anniversary of my blogger, (which happened to be Tuesday) but for a number of reasons, I have decided against it...  NUMBER ONE:  My computer, as well as Blogger, has been stubborn and not been helping me with.....anything.  NUMBER TWO: It's hot.  No. No.  Stop it.  No, you be quiet.  It's hot.  Ok?  NUMBER THREE: It's come to my attention that when one looks back on my archives, the largest majority of what one will find is me complaining.  So I thought, "Hey, why not celebrate a great year of complaining with more complaints!"  So there you go!     HAPPY ANNIVERSARY "A SINGLE TWISTED THOUGHT"!!!

      Recently, a number of members of my family are starting diets of different sorts.  They range from "eat anything you can turn into a smoothie" to "as long as it doesn't go in the mouth" (for the bolder members of the family).  I'm sure it comes as a surprise to no one, the "inventors" of these diets (I put inventors in quotation marks because they really didn't do much at all) make upwards of $10,000.  Which got me thinking, "I could do that..."  So here's my plan.   The Four-Year-Old's Golden Path   My program reveals the cryptic and ancient secrets of child day care specialists.  You go on a one month binge of:      Grape juice      Crackers (but with no cheese) (unless you use that stuff from a can with the bacon flavoring, I like that stuff)      Small amounts of ice cream      Broiled skinless chicken breast (cut up into small squares)      Hot dog (cut up into small squares)      Baby carrots      Celery w/peanut butter & raisins (specifically) and most importantly      Twice the daily recommended amount of Flinstones Chewables (but not the red ones)  Within the first two weeks, you'll have more energy, guaranteed.   Don't forget to nap!

      Folks, I made it into SOTA.  I would've had a post all about it, but I had written so much to get in, I couldn't stroke another key.  It's only been three days, and already, I'm braindead from a single freewriting practice.  We were encouraged to write away all conscious thought, and let our subconscious drive our writing.  I'd like to post what I wrote.  It's not quite anything besides a random occuring of thoughts, so please excuse the confusion:   Clarity, I don't believe it exists anymore. Nor does the profound Or the inspirational. There is only guesswork to be done Pioneering the future with a game of poker Magic 8 Ball mechanical prophet Evolution needless packaging Thought within a thought within a thought within that condom wrapper you keep in your wallet  Waiting until you get to use it  Your mind is a masturbatory car wreck A joke to your God  Do you know your God?  He's Jeff.  And he's thinking And I'm thinking And we shouldn't Because we watch TV                                       Opiate infinitum continuum  Relief is self preservation  And sticking around is suicide No reason?

Heck, it's funny                               Hilarious too                              Boisterous  Cancerous and charming, he slipped from under the bed Abortionist extraordinaire, he speaks in croaks and gurgles, over the class and through concrete to neutralize children with lights and toys and, yes, secrets.  "Tell me a promise and a lie."  They're the same if you love your God.  "Believe in me and you shall find peace"?  No.  Believe in me or I won't exist Believe in me or you won't fight. Believe in me because I'm beautiful  Blink and repeat process:  Religion death sorrow retalliation  Victory death religion   Looking at it, I realize that it's much more fun when I'm braindead...

      I'm infinitely sorry I haven't been writing here in such a long while.  For the past some odd weeks, I've been writing solely for classes, and doing very little personal work.  All I can really think to write in here anymore is, "Oh my God:  SOTA blah and SOTA drugs blah."  And who'd want to read that?  As if I'd have the balls to post anything I've written either.  At least, nothing I can't defend with a braindead moment.  But hey, come to our performance October 10th.  It's at 7 at the SOTA auditorium.  Please, support the arts.

      Here's a word I use too much: cacophony.  Which is defined as either...

Fuck you, Word of the Day calendars.  That's right, "Fuck you, Word of the Day calendars."  Fuck, defined as:      Wait, no way am I defining fuck, I'll be typing all damn night.

      Seeing as how I haven't written anything on my blog since last October, I thought I might as well start again.  Recently: Poetry Cafe - Performance at SOTA.  Woo.      It went off without a hitch, even in the face of advertsity.  Last minute changes modified plans and ruined some of the best inside jokes.  Because the poetry cafe was both a poetry reading/book release party and a fashion show, there were intervals between readings where the characters of the Alice in Wonderland-noir-glam show would come out, do a small dance or something of the sort, and then sit on stage.  I was Tweedle-dee, Aidan was Tweedle-dum, and Sloane (a colleague from SOTA for those of you who don't follow my story) was Dinah the Cat.  Aidan and I were supposed to walk around in matching noir detective suits, looking at everyone on stage suspiciously, and take our seats.  At a different interval, Sloane was supposed to come out, adjust her fishnets suggestively, dance around Aidan's seat, play with his hair, seduce him, and then sit on his lap.  Would've been a cantankerous laugh riot.  And it got cut.  Instead, Sloane walked out ahead of us, sat down, Aidan and I did our thing, we go to leave, Sloane pulls  me  down into the chair, and Aidan sits beside us.  A classy joke that would've had such relevance to the mentality of my associates got turned into an irrelevant sleu of awkwardness.  Superbowl - New England wins, Janet flashes nation.      As a finale to the halftime show, Justin Timberlake accidently pulled off Janet Jackson's breast plate, thereby having her breast exposed to everyone watching the Superbowl.  I mention this for the fact that February 1st marks the beginning of Black History Month.  What's the most dignified way for a black entertainer to kick off the month?  Why not have your tittie exposed by a freaky, beatboxing white boy?  (Note: This will most likely be the only time that Justin Timberlake and/or Janet Jackson is mentioned in this blog.  That is, if I ever post again.)

      Before I begin, I need everyone reading to do something.  This is what's known as interactivity. Ready? Ok.  Put up your left hand and spread out your fingers.  Now, using your right index finger and thumb, measure the length of your pinky-nail.  Hold it up in the air in front of this article.   That's how much I know about Dick Dale.      For those of you who thought I was about to make a crass joke about one's penis, you should be ashamed of yourself.  Back to my point: I know so very little about Dick Dale, yet I just got  Better Shread than Dead: The Dick Dale Anthology      And it's just completely fucking perfect.  Two CDs, thirty-nine great songs, and thirty-eight chances missed for Quentin Tarantino to find the perfect setting for the music.  Dale even plays the Jewish folksong, Hava Nagila.  As funny as it sounds, Hava Nagila has never been more intense.  Jewish surfers everywhere rejoice.  The entire collection was only about $30 via internet shipping, but comes to about $28 for those shopping in store (for those penny-pinchers out there).  I, of course, played hermit and decided to pay extra for having it shipped over a thousand miles when I could've walked five blocks to buy it myself.  Either way, if you're a fan of surf-music or feel inadequate without knowledge of Dick Dale's craft, then I recommend you buy this masterpiece.

      I encourage everyone reading this to shell out $25 dollars and preorder Chuck Palahniuk's new book,  Stranger Than Fiction: True Stories .  It's a collection of the most horrible and bizarre happenings to have gone on around the world.  And you know as well as I do, if Chuck picked them, then they have to be mind-bending.  Furthermore, if you've never read anything by Chuck Palahniuk nor seen  Fight Club  and then thought about reading some of his stuff, then you must buy a copy of  Choke , another masterpiece by Chuck Palahniuk.  It's a story of a sex addict who works at a colonial theme park, deals with his comatose bitch of a mother (how she's a bitch  and  comatose, I'll never know), and tries to prevent himself from acquiring any morals and fulfilling his destiny of being the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Even if you hate to read, if you have even a sliver of pervert running through your blood (and everyone does, it just matters how they show it), then you can appreciate this vile piece of literature.  I also encourage reading  Survivor .  It's not the story of some bastard stranded on a desert island, it's the story of the last well-mannered survivor of the Creedish Death Cult.  Not only is this book an excellent work of art, it also teaches one how to remove blood from clothes, take bullet holes out of walls, and perfectly eat a lobster (even if the little bastard is still alive).  In one twist of the story, the protagonist hijacks an airplace and threatens to shoot anyone without manners.  "Anyone caught buttering their bread before breaking it will be shot.  Anyone who holds a red wine glass by the stem or a white wine glass by the bowl will be shot..."  Maybe I'm just rambling.  Either way, read the man's work.  If you have already, pre-order yourself a copy of his new book.

      All I've been doing recently is endorsing products.  I'm trying to make a god damn comeback and all I can say is, "Hey!  Buy!  Good stuff!"  Sheer capitalism.  Just sheer.  And here I am, thinking, "You know, I should probably say something about Leonard Cohen,"  and I swear, I was about to, but besides realizing that all I do is pimp, I also came to the conclusion that I couldn't say anything about Leonard Cohen that hasn't already been said.  And I've got a decent sized vocabulary, I can usually come up with something about anything (granted I know what I'm talking about).  Well, I'm pimping one last thing before I set this place straight:   Rat Tail   The Creative Writing department of the School of the Arts requires that every individual publish his/her own book of poems and short stories as a part of his/her final grade.  We write, cut, paste, draw, organize, type, copy, publish, and pay for all materials that go into it, every individual publisher decides upon a price, and we sell them at the writing events we hold, as well as on our own.      Rat Tail is mine.      Twenty seven pages of poetry, fiction, fat babies, homosexual innuendos, communism, partial nudity, and zoot suits.  Best of all, I'm selling them for a buck each.  That's right.  A buck.  $1.  No more.  (The price is probably why they sold out so fast at the performance.)  My friends and colleagues charged more than $3, $4, $5 a copy, some even going for $9 a copy!  Sure, I could've made more money that way, but why would I make someone pay to read my material when they could just as well go, "Hey, Nick, can I read _____?"  I should be paying the reader to take my writing, just so I can get my stuff out.  However, I'm not that benevolent, so I decided on charging a dollar.   urlLink Send orders to demortius@comcast.net  identifying yourself and I'll send a reply with my personal address.  Put a dollar in an envelope with a return address, and as soon as I can staple seven pages together, you'll receive your copy of Rat Tail in the mail.  Or you Instant Message me on AIM: DemortiusXV.  Or you can skip that and just talk to me in person.   Order before February 29th and I'll take a whole quarter off your order!  That's right, only 75 cents for a copy of Nicholas J. Sanz-Gould's personal collection of writing.  But only if you order before the 29th!     Ok, I'm done pimping.  No more, I swear.  Maybe just one more next week for Umlaut, but nothing needless.

      So I'm in the middle of Chinatown with a friend of mine today, wandering around through some dried foods store, when he suddenly looks at me and says, "So, you wanna get high?" I think to myself, "Sure, why not? I wanted to gorge myself on dim sum anyhow, might as well heighten the experience." Six minutes later, we emerge from the alley and go back onto the main drag of produce stores and antique shops, looking for a decent place to eat. My friend (yeah, protecting his name) spends most of his time testing each dim sum and Chinese barbecue joint he passes, so he knew the exact one he wanted to go to. For whatever reason, before we got to eat, he decided to guide me through all the trippiest places within a six block radius. Most things I could deal with: herb shop, toy store, smack junkie alleyway landmarks, etc. But he was only getting started. Soon, we turned into a fresh fish market. Now, I know fish markets are nothing to be freaked out about, even on drugs, but fish markets differ by location. For most folk, a fresh fish market means different cuts of fish and crustaceans, sliced in various fashions, kept frozen or chilled, behind glass at your local supermarket or deli. In Chinatown, fresh fish markets consist of different species fish, crustaceans, cephalopods, and amphibians, some flopping around in plastic boxes with shallow amounts of water, and some piled on top of each other in bins. Besides the stench being overwhelming, some fish and turtles have their innards spilled out, like this:    Normally, I don't have a problem with organs, muscles, tissues, blood, other bodily fluids, etc, but for some reason, my drug tainted mind just raced and I all but flipped out. My  urlLink breathing sounded like that from the Depeche Mode song, Personal Jesus , and it stayed that way until we made it out of Chinatown and into North Beach.  North Beach is comparatively less stimulating, yet my friend managed to have me blow my cool a few more times. One of the places he took me into was a cutlery shop, pulsing with techno, to take a gander at knives. Somewhere in the middle of our browsing, I asked him if he knew the status of switchblades. I hadn't seen one being sold anywhere, and naturally assumed they were illegal. He thought the same thing, but just to be safe, he asked one of the clerks. We were both still acting goofy and I didn't want to engage anyone normal in any conversation, let alone on the legality of certain items. The clerk was an extremely jolly (plump) middle aged woman who appeared to be working there with her husband for a long, long while. She bluntly confirmed that switchblades were 100% illegal, but quickly launched into, "We have some lovely  alternatives  to switchblades, however!" She pulled out four medium sized knives and arranged them in a line on the glass case in front of us. "These are called 'assisted blades,' and they're very similar to switchblades..." She picked one up and pulled her finger down the hilt of the knife, swinging the blade out with a flash. I tried not to look too surprised as I smiled at her. She went through their specs, locks, sizes, choices of finishing, and prices before handing one knife to my friend and another to myself. He flicked the knife out, moved it around in the air, passed it from hand to hand, and turned to me going, "What do you think, fast enough?" and "I don't think this is sharp enough..." And "Will Kevlar gloves stop this?"  I'm not suggesting that one shouldn't go out high into the world, more the opposite, but if I had been on something stronger, I probably would've had massive panic attacks with the turtles and pulsing techno.   (I'm aware that some of the people reading this may be upset to find that I've used drugs, but I promise that I'm being as responsible as I can with them, and would never go into a dangerous situation while impaired. Nor am I forgetting my normal responsibilities and obligations to my school, family, or self-being.)
