       urlLink Amazon.com: So You'd Like to... Be a drag queen trapped in a woman's body...   This is my guide to being a drag queen trapped in a woman's body.  I like it-- and you can figure out a lot about a person based on what's in their CD collection. Read it and get yourself a feather boa.

      Yesterday, I was browsing one of my favorite webpages-- a movie review site that I occasionally disagree with but always am interested in.  She had this comment on there, though, about politics that I disagreed with.  I thought about this a lot because it bugged me to find political chatter with which I disagreed on an entertainment website.  But then, here I am doing a similar thing with my own site.  It's tricky.....  Maybe it just drives home to me that sometimes we shouldn't express our own politics on our personal entertainment websites.  But that is problematic too because of the whole "personal is political" thing.  Everything is personal, and everything is political, and it's all part of what makes us growing human beings.    SIGH.  I just know that I was turned off of what used to be an absolute favorite website.  I don't know how I feel about it.  She certainly has that right to her opinion, too, but my sick feeling about how irritated it made me to see her spouting off opinions that I think are insulting when I just went there to see how she felt about "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind" and the new "Lord of the Rings" movie is too much to think about now.    And, in case anyone notices, through the trickery of the web, I have edited this blog to remove the actual content that I was complaining about.  Why?  Mostly because I think I am right and my website shouldn't be a place I put this type of politics too far out there-- and I also am tired of getting nasty emails from people who disagree with me.  So you can just guess what the opinion I didn't like was.  Nyah.  Pfffhtt.  Write me a poorly spelled email about how I'm censoring the media and that makes me a sellout and therefore an evil charlatan.  That'll be a lot more fun to delete than something about the 2000 presidential election, and you can guess how I feel about that, too.

      Well today it looks like we've launched a campaign against Iraq for sure.  We've dropped 40 cruise missles and several big bombs (I don't think they were those MOAB's, but big).  I think they're going for a "scare the crap out of 'em with big stuff they can't possibly anticipate" attack.  It's really a different world to be observing a "war" that you yourself do not have any stakes in.  Back in the Gulf War, I had a (yes, he was a  jerk but) boyfriend over there, and a "pen pal" I wrote to as well.  This one, Andrew really has a miniscule chance of going there.  I do possibly know people who are there-- basically, it's possible that folks who were in Andrew's squadron long ago are there.  But most likely, they are in planes which will fly over and aren't even offensive planes, so I don't think that Iraq has much chance doing any damage to them.  I suppose it's possible, but I think the most likely damage they can inflict is through terrorist acts-- dropping a chem bomb on Israel, or something.  In their minds, this attack by us is directly motivated by Israel.    So, that's the news, which I feel strangely glib about.  I guess with all the preparation over the last months, I am just glad it's finally happening and can get over!     Anyway, as with an "historic" event, it will be interesting to say the least to see what happens.

      My mother & grandmother finally left this morning. They were  supposed  to leave Sunday, but they missed their train, thanks to the stupidity and inefficiency of the train company's 1-800 number who told me the train would be there 3 hours after it actually was.  What is the point of an informational number when the information is criminally inaccurate?  It's just a good thing I didn't kill them while they were here, because I would have had an arguable case.    Okay, I know this one is a very serious and depressing blog.  But they can't all be drag queens and martinis, now, can they?

      Oh yes, and if you've tuned in for something smart and witty, I am thinking up a fabulous (and read that word in a high pitched voice) list to post on Amazon.com.  It's scholarly, and naughty, and really wicked + weird.  So stay tuned, gentle (and surely bored as hell) reader!  And I'm back to belly dancing!  We went to Debbie's "advanced" class last week.  WHEW!  She is not kidding about advanced!  It was fun, though, except she has "fat mirrors" at the studio.  They did make my arms look really buff, however, so I'll forgive the middle emphasis.  I just have to behave and have no more of those Godiva things.  Think "Lady Godiva" not "Godiva chocolate."

      Ick.  The night of my last blog, I actually hurt my knee, thanks to those "fun drinks."  I'm better, thanks to a good old fashioned Ace Bandage.  But we were doing this reggae thing, and I tried a back bend-y sort of dance, and I don't think Germans can bend that way.  At least not without some sort of major issues.     Anyway, I am planning this week to do some more writing on the Updike chapter of the dissertation, and try really hard to get that darn proposal ready for committee.  Spring Break was not as productive, writing wise, as I'd hoped, but I did do some more thinking.  So what if that's all I do; eventually I'll think me up a book.  I also graded a bunch of student work-- so help me, I am not teaching again in the Fall.  While students can be so fun & inspiring (really!) the grading just takes up so much time.  I sometimes wish I could just let them grade themselves-- I think some universities do that.  You'd be surprised at how honest some are when it comes down to it.  On the website notes, Lisa Johnson, who is guest editing this next issue, seems to be getting tons of great submissions.  I am truly jealous-- but then, I actually haven't promoted the scholarly page in ages.  I just don't have the time to read over anything, and I think it's a great idea to do guest editors.  I may have to solicit another one for the Winter issue since Lisa's going so well.  But then, I trust her work, having known it for a long time now!  Maybe Natasha will want to do something-- but then, she is so great with book reviews.     More pages done on the scrapbook, too.  I know that's boring, but I drug my mom & Grandma to two different scrapbook shops here in town, and spent a boatload of money on stupid little decorative things to put on the pages.  That is one addictive hobby, I will tell you!  I'm just glad I don't have kids because there are some darn cute things you can do with those family books.  Thank the goddess my pages are only one event!   And now back to Neal Gaiman's  American Gods  which is looking promising so far.  We've already got Woden, and some Russian goddesses, and I think a guest appearance by Coatalique, and a great joke about Thor & Freya.  (sort of).

      Okay, I am not out of juice-- my mother & grandmother are visiting for Spring Break, and I'm finding a little bit of "less time" as an effect.  So I promise to get back with this next week.  I do want to keep it up here (no Beevis & Butthead pun intended there) but I'm a little over tasked.  I'm trying, also, to do my "scrapbook" from my England/France trip last summer before I go to someone's wedding in May (she knows who she is) so I can show it off.  I've got about 10 pages out of  50ish done-- and it's actually going quite well.  But combine that with the exercise routine, feeding the fam, and all that other crap (includes Buffy watching) and I'm a little over extended.  So if you're tuning in, gentle reader, I promise to provide juicy bits of fun soon.   On that note, we created a fun drink tonight.  I declared it my offical "fun food day" which means no more liquor for a least a week... but it was worth it.  1 shot of Godiva Chocolate liquer to 1 shot Absolut Mandarin Vodka in a Martini glass.  YUM says I.  I have had my three for the week.  :)  But it was tasty, and if I'm spelling things wrongly, or using non-standard grammar, that would be why.  But the cat is safe, and Grandma is in bed, and Madonna is on the music channel, and life is sweet.    And I have at least one fan.  Cool. :)  Love.

       urlLink RedEnvelope  This is a really cool website where you can buy neat-o gifts.  Jeannine told me about it when we were debating something for her wedding plans... I am not endorsing it except to say I really like this stuff and wouldn't mind anything that you found here being purchased as a gift for me (this, of course, is for my family & friends.  Why would complete strangers buy me gifts!?)

      Allright I think I've figured it out....  I think I know how to do this blog editing thing-- I kind of have this page customized to look a little bit like women writers-- but it's also different since it's different.  :)  I'm also going to wait till there's a lot more content to really encourage lots of people to drop by, but if you're here already, go to the other pages on women writers to see more junk & stuff & nonsense.  Maybe check out the  urlLink rants -- they're the closest the website comes to blog style speak.

      Howdy!   I thought I might get on the bandwagon and start a blog, so that I can update my website with amazing content while being self-centered and pretending I am interesting to others.  So here it is, my blog.  Are you really reading this, and if so, why?  Aren't there wonderful things out there to read other than my ramblings?  But then, says the self-centered part of me, perhaps my musings will show you that even people who apparently have it together (some people think I do) can still have trouble every day.  Maybe I'm also thinking about the way sometimes I get these horrible interactions with people because I don't have a mind-reading program and can't tell always when email is sarcastic or whatever, and this way I can write about that in a quick and easy format and I don't have to do the HTML myself, but I can quickly write a web journal thingy that will keep me writing and keep the world informed about me.     I guess it went to my head a bit that two (count them baby) people came up to me at the last conference I went to in Albequerque (click  urlLink here  for info)  and said "hey, I love what you do on your website."  I'm getting all famous and stuff.  But it also set me to thinking... I  have  offended a couple of people in the past (sometimes intentionally, sometimes not).  So, what if one of those people who called me nasty names and disparaged my "work ethic" show up at some conference I'm attending, and throw a Martini in my face or something?  Maybe I better cultivate better web-karma or else I might end up with vodka and gin in my eyes!!  Is it likely?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Maybe my head is so big I won't be able to take off my t-shirt and put on my pj's later tonight.      But this is my first entry.  We'll see if I stick to this or not... I'm gonna try.  Heck, if one of my favorite authors ( urlLink Neil Gaiman ) can do it, with all his fame & creative writing work, I can do it, right? (Okay, for you  urlLink womenwriters  visitors, I know he's a guy-- I do read male writers too, and none of my favorite women writers as far as I know has a blog that they update).  I am trying to not feel like I'm betraying my cause... so no e-mail about this, please.  The blog is kind of going to be separate from the website's goals since my daily life doesn't JUST involve promoting women authors. ::feeling defensive, perhaps for no reason::   So, if you're in the mood, send me an email and I might respond here, or post your letter, make fun of your spelling & grammar, etc.  I don't know-- wasn't I trying to work on NOT getting Martinis thrown in my face? Okay, I'll only make fun of you anonymously.  Is that better?  And if you throw a drink in my face, make it a Cosmopolitan or a Godiva White Chocolate Martini.  At least then I can enjoy it.     And finally, if you found this site by some other path than going through my women writers website,  urlLink you ought to check it out .  It's pretty cool, if I do say so myself.  And I do.

      I'm feeling really cranky, depressed & out of sorts today.  Part of it is that I have an extreme allergy/cold thing going on-- I'm taking antihistimine & stuff to feel better, and probably that's making me feel a little icky.  But another part is just the brain working.  One of my good friends just had a baby, and in the email to friends to show us pictures of this little cutie was the address of ANOTHER friend with whom I've lost touch over the last couple of years.  Part of it was just busy-ness-- or so I figured.  We used to work together, and talk a lot via email, and hang out now & then.  She had a bunch of busy crazy things happen-- moved to a couple of new cities, got a new job/career.  In the midst of that, we sort of stopped corresponding.  I had sent her a few things here and there-- party invitations, stuff.  And I hadn't heard back, but hadn't really put it to anything serious-- just general busy people syndrome.     I figured for a long time it was only that.  But I recently emailed her with the address in the email from the other friend (you with me still? it's convoluted) and haven't gotten anything back.   Since I know she's a big online email person who checks her email as much as I do, I suspect that there's something else. I feel a little paranoid, but I also feel like I don't know what I did to lose this person's friendship, which I apparently have.  If it were just a matter of losing touch, it would be one thing, but she lives nearby again, and I've tried to keep up the old email thing.  But apparently she doesn't want to correspond with me at all, but won't tell me what it is I did to offend, or whatever.  I feel a bit like a dork for even caring-- and have decided to not try to get the ball rolling again-- I can, after all, take a hint eventually.  But I guess I feel a little like a guy who's been broken up with by a girl and doesn't really know why-- and it bugs me a bit. I have dozens of fabulous friends, I am a lucky person in my friendships and generally, the ones I value hang around a long time.  But I think it's just not knowing what the heck happened that bugs me here.  I don't remember being weird or anything, or doing something that was mean or whatever.  So I guess mulling this over has me feeling a little sad.  But hopefully, writing this will get me over it and I'll feel better.    Now if I could just get over the allergy thing and stop feeling so crappy, physically!

      Today I am totally and irrevocably being a drain on society.  I am not, as usual, watching TLC and hoping for fairies to write my dissertation while I sigh over lovely weddings and makeovers.  But close enough-- I've just been playing on bulletin boards and stuff all morning.  But I do have to wait around for the plumber to come and see what's wrong in our laundry room, so it's not like I'd be all that productive anyway (she says defensively.)     But I am also working on the new summer edition of the zine.  (more defensively)

      I just sent this FAQ to Neil Gaiman,    I'm terribly lazy and would rather be reading good books than webpages (even if yours are delightful, and read by me regularly anyway.)  But I just finished a book series I loved, and in my deep funk because I have no more of those favorites to read, having gobbled them up greedily, and bereftly looking for another author like her (Jaqueline Carey), I found you had positively reviewed Storm Constantine (who amazon listed as "similar to Carey").  Since I love your work, and respect your opinion, I bought several of Constantine's books (they haven't arrived yet but I have great hopes).  So on to the lazy question:  Do you have a list of authors you would "not trade for"[I think it was 20] Anne Rices"? (that's a poorly remembered paraphrase of your review of her).  People you have on that bookshelf you frequently re-read, that isn't necessarily the shelf you parade for impressing guests?  Maybe ten or so, and then I can go from there?  Dark, twisted, but ultimately heartwarming & funny stuff?  Stuff by which Queen Victoria would *not* be amused?  Goth-y stuff that makes you think?  Stuff like yours, and Constantine's, and heck, maybe even Pratchett's?  Since I've already gobbled up all of your books (I am working through the comics) I have to find other ways to squander the time with which I *ought* to be writing my doctoral dissertation. (Someday it will happen, maybe fairies will leave it on my computer if I ask nicely enough).  I notice that you frequently recommend books, and truly appreciate that.  But a handy dandy printable list would be something wonderful because the recommendations in teeny weeny "eye-strain-o-vision"(TM) are scattered through months of blogs....    Thank you even if you can't do this since you have a job to do..... Kim Wells (oh, and I have a website on books, and though I'm afraid you'll hate it and talk about what a dolt I am in your next blog, it will have a new issue out soon.) www.womenwriters.net    I'll see if he answers.  At the risk of sounding like I'm trying to suck up so he'll answer my post if he reads this blog entry and sees I'm trying to promote him, even though not on my gender-specific site but through this handy-dandy back door.......I really do like his blog, and it inspires me to get in here and write my own every once in a while.  Mostly because I know, as a writing teacher, that to write you have to write every darn day.  And I'm not doing that, and instead watching re-runs of A Wedding Story again and again and hoping beyond hope that those dissertation fairies will get busy!  What do you have to leave out for dissertation fairies?  I know you leave a bowl of milk out for some fairies, and liquor's good for others.  What do dissertation fairies eat?  Anyone know from personal experience?

      For a minute, there, I was really confused.  I get this email, along with dozens of spam letters among other things advising me how to get viagra cheap (cause everyone knows we all need that!) that just starts out "you seem to be confusing fact with opinion" and blasting my discussion of the trouble I had with my entertainment website having political opinion.  You know, with my website, I sometimes get cranky email about the different opinions-- those that have gotten the most are New Orleans on New Years' one, and the Roe v. Wade one, and, surprisingly, the review of A Year In Tuscany.  But usually, it's fairly obvious what someone is talking about, and it doesn't throw me to get this hostile email in my mailbox, because they have some skill with correspondance & are clear on their point.  First thing in the morning, having my first latte and moving to check my email, I don't need random hostility in my mailbox.  Spam I can handle-- the delete button is getting worn off, but I can handle it.    So here's my deal.  I teach technical writing to college students, and I always stress that in email, you're writing sometimes to complete strangers, but  you  feel like it's a conversation that is going on right now.  You MUST write coherently, somewhat formally, and have your POINT be obvious.  Of course, when you're forwarding stupid jokes to friends, or writing about something that IS in someone's mind right this second, this rule can be broken.  You can write informally, etc.  But if you're writing to someone who hasn't been thinking of you, you need to write like a Victorian.  Be polite.  Be wordy.  Be clear & concise.    I have gotten sick of answering random hostile strangers because it usually only ends up in my obsessing for weeks over the email, and feeling bad, and worrying that the person will show up at some conference and throw a drink in my face.   So now, I am handling irritating ones the same way as SPAM.  ::Delete::  Not the ones with an honest query, or merely because they disagree with me (the anti-abortion guy who wrote got a long, long, carefully considered and carefully nice letter, probably a lot more than he wanted!) but anything that sets my hackles up is just going to go into the recycle bin.  I don't have the energy anymore.

      And I don't know why, but mysteriously, parts of my blog archives don't seem to work. Some of them are just fine, but some are apparently just not there.  EEEK!

       urlLink Bitch | Feminist Response to Pop Culture  I found this magazine today, while lurking about the Internet looking for useful stuff about Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  (Yes, it is TOO working on the dissertation.... and I am totally NOT defensive about the Buffy part.)  So I am capable of getting distracted by magazines like Bitch (but in a way, not, cause it's about feminism, and the popular sort, kinda, so there).    But anyway.  Check it out.  I might just have to try to write something for them someday when they post new "we need writers for..." statements.  That'd be cool.  Plus, I like their name.    And I happen to have written four whole pages on my Buffy chapter.  :)

      I just wanted to add this here since it was something I just read on Gaiman's website:  "the law of Conservation of Cats"-- which basically is if you lose a cat, you will certainly be presented with a new one to take care of.  I want to think about that more; but for now, I have other things to do.... it's here to remind me to think.     I wish reminders were always that easy.

      Well, I've finally finished the Summer 2003 issue of  urlLink Women Writers .  It's a really great issue--  urlLink Lisa Johnson   did a wonderful job with the "autotheory" issue.  It's our first "special issue" and I'm going to do one for the Winter issue, too, I think.  I've got to put out a call for proposals... I really ought to do that now.  (thinking of things to say in the call.....)   So now I have   absolutely   no excuse-- I should be working on the dissertation.  I actually have done so this morning by reading this Buffy theory book  urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Philosophy .  It's a good philosphy text; it introduces concepts from basic philosophy in relation to Sunnydale & the Buffyverse.  It's already proven very useful in letting me know of the existence of  urlLink a place where I can get shooting scripts  for the most recent season of Buffy,  as well as  urlLink Slayage , the "online journal of Buffy Studies." I already know about  urlLink Television Without Pity , which is less useful for academic things but really interesting for a look at the popular idea of Buffy + theory & debate.  So this is what I'm doing right now.  Interesting, huh?  And for those of you who think my whole "dissertation" thing is a scam and excuse for me to watch TV, I say "duh."     Anyhoo.  Back to the readage.  And maybe a nap.  I think well when I'm napping-- some of my best papers ever came to me while in the twilight zone between nap & awake-- where the academic muse can find us and we're not distracted by other things.  It's hard for her to get out of that Ivory Tower you know.

      I just got this email: "I just want to say I loved the review at amazon .com.  I have said for years that I am a drag queen trapped in a straight girl's body.  I am also a radical feminist who loves red lipstick.  I have just discovered your web site & plan to be a frequent visitor." Carla   Yay!  A fan who isn't required to be one by already being a friend of mine!  Hee hee.  Also, I secretly suspected that there were many drag queens in a woman's body out there.  Now I have proof that there are at least two of us. If you are a girl-drag-queen too, write, and we'll form a club or something.  Of course, I think a "club" might be entirely too organized a concept for a true drag queen.  Maybe form a loose alliance, with territories mapped off, like lion prides.

      Does owning four Barbies make me a freaky collector?  I have  urlLink Wonder Woman , the  urlLink Wicked Witch of the West ,  urlLink Aviator Barbie , and A "graduation" Barbie from 1998, so she's technically "Master's Degree" Barbie.  I really want I urlLink  Dream of Jeannie  and Samantha from  urlLink Bewitched Barbie  too.  They will all eventually make their way onto my bookshelves in the permanent office I hope to someday have on a college campus near you.... (or near me).  So I'll be weirdo Dr. Wells who has a thing for Barbies.  I'd love a Virgin of Guadalupe Barbie too-- maybe I have to get that custom made.  Ah, I can see strange heights of collectible mania spreading my way.  It's a like a rash, I think.

      Well, in case you're wondering, the writing has gone really really well the last two weeks.  I have a lot of work done on my introductory chapter, my proposal is ALMOST ready to send to my committee, and the Buffy chapter is up to the mid-twenties in page length and I haven't even talked about Willow yet.  So writing at Starbuck's has gone well, except for one day when this chatty guy wouldn't take a polite hint and kept talking and talking (and talking) to me.  I kept trying to "scratch my nose" with my wedding-ringed left hand, in the hopes that he would realize "hey, this chick is married and so my flirting is doing no good" but maybe he either didn't get such a subtle hint or didn't care.  He  was  definitely flirting, but maybe some guys don't realize that not every woman flirts back just because she isn't outright rude.  I dunno.  For a long time it wasn't an issue; when I was chubby, no guys really even noticed (a sad truth that women who are "older" or over a certain body weight are invisible in our culture!!)    Anyway, I'm going to the gym in a few minutes, and later next week will be going to Florida for my niece's wedding and then to Alabama to do a "just write it" week at my "retreat" in Birmingham.  :)  I have no idea if anyone other than the "retreat hostess" ever even reads this thing, but I thought I'd update just in case.

      So on another note, in the "private life, stop complaining about writing" world, Tituba went to the vet this morning.  She's been scratching her ears a lot lately, and holding them down like she's annoyed (makes her look a little like a black Yoda).  So I knew there was something.  She has an ear infection, poor little thing.  She really hated the whole process of people poking her & getting blood drawn and all.  But I feel a little better, although terribly guilty that I didn't do something about it sooner.  The gunk that came out of her ears when the vet stuck a q-tip (kids don't try this at home) in there!  Bleah!!!    I also finished up a series of "fun books" this morning.  I'm going to review them for the website's next update, I think.  Storm Constantine's Wraethuthu books are pretty fab.  I got them based in part on Neil Gaiman's blurb on the latest one (since I love his work, I figured I'd like the stuff he liked-- a generally good rule, and the principle behind those "other author" blurbs on books, I reckon).   If you can't wait till my rave review in the January issue of the zine, read for yourself:   urlLink the first series  and then there's the one out in hardback   urlLink  most recent addition to the series  which I liked even more than the first trilogy.  Probably because the fourth book deals much more with the feminine side of the "Har".  Good stuff!!  It's rich, in that way that makes you long for more when you're done reading it.

      So in the last week, I've gone from the previous "pit of despair" area on my dissertation to feeling pretty darn good.  Sunday (ish) I came up, in my sleep, with some ideas.  Monday & Tuesday I wrote a BUNCH, on both the proposal/intro chapter & the Buffy chapter.  I haven't revised that writing yet, but when I do, I expect it to give me something like 30 pages of writing.  Yesterday & today were/are lazy days, and then tomorrow & the weekend I plan to do a bunch of writing again.  It feels really good, and for the first time in a couple of weeks, I feel as though this is actually do-able again.    One of the things that helped a lot was going over to Keval's condo to write.  It's all empty, and very feng shui with a water fountain gushing in the courtyard & no distractions.  I also hung out at the Starbuck's down the street, which, unlike the one near my house, seemed quieter & more conducive to work.  I will try the closer one again this weekend, and if it is, as has been the case in the past, too noisy & distracting, I'll go to the 281 & Bitters one (like that makes sense  to ANYONE but me.!)  :)  I want to get a trickly fountain for my house, now, though.  It has to be big enough to make a good amount of noise.... the one my mom got me a few years ago didn't do much.    It's all good!!

      What I wish I knew is this:  Is it some kind of computer program/virus thing that generates the headings for all the stupid spam that one gets every day?  Because sometimes I get four or five of exactly the same email with totally different "re" lines.  "Glad to see you" and "that info you asked about" and "increase your penis size rdosrss33" and other vauge, but very (sometimes) creative things in/on them.  I, of course, delete them, diligently add them to the "spam filter" (and I'm quite sure most of those spammers never use the same email address again, so the step is somewhat pointless).  Maybe I don't really wish I knew it, maybe by asking the question here in a somewhat public place I'm asking for trouble.  Maybe someone will now explain in exruciating detail how spam works, and I will wish for the days when all I had to do was throw out complaints from high school students that I don't do enough to allow them to plagiarize my website.  ::sigh::  I keep getting rather intriguing emails about being able to get your university degree (including PhD's) with no coursework and very little hassle.  All strictly confidential.  And there's a phone number you have to call.  Is this some sort of ploy by academia, and if you call, you can promise to never get a tenure-track job?  They're monitoring us slackers who think about easy outs from writing dissertations and taking classes? (I have to say, in retrospect, that coursework is/was my favorite part of college-- I miss it terribly because there were deadlines, and constant talks about interesting topics that I had made myself read, in a timely fashion.  Now college is all one big giant guilt trip-- but I digress).  Or are there, as we speak/write, college professors out there we're calling Dr. So-in-so who have their degrees from this secret university, and perhaps they're even on our hiring committees chortling away at our endless collegiate fumbling towards eternity while they merely wrote a check and filled out some form?  It's a mystery of the universe, I think.

      Okay, for anyone keeping up..... I have reached a good spot after all my complaining about my dissertation the other day.  My friend who lurks this blog called & we made plans to do a "group work" session really soon.  But really, what helped even more than that was that I started talking about my frustration.  Isn't that always the way it goes?   You get depressed, keep it to yourself, and it just gets worse.  So I talked to Andrew about it, he got me to outline more what I was doing with the Buffy chapter (and the whole dissertation, really) and, since the other day, I've come to a "breakthrough" in thinking (at least) about that chapter.  I think I know now where I need to go with it.  Monday I'm going to sit down and try to really crank out some ideas-- Andrew will be gone all day and I won't touch anything other than dissertation writing, darn it!    But this is good-- I woke up this morning with it kind of worked out-- (I have to admit it felt better during the night when I thought it over-- sort of like a dream that fades a bit when you don't write it down right away.)  But I don't think I lost more than just a minor bit of "flow" that I can rework in there eventually.   In other news   So yesterday we had a nice fourth of July thing.  People came to our house for a while, ate, and then we caravanned over to Randolph AFB for a big fireworks show.  We had sort of "factioned" from another friend's party, who was just planning on setting off their own store-bought stuff.  I felt bad about that because it did cause a smaller group to go to their place-- but there wasn't any reason why they HAD to put off their own stuff last night-- they could have done their party tonight and we wouldn't have had to choose between the two events.  But it was fun.  Debbie of bellydance instruction came, and other "new friends" like Jamie & her husband Leonard, and Vicki brought a nice date (Carl).  Then it was just the regular gang (Aaron, Nissa, Steve, Keval, Jeffrey).  Some of the folks didn't go to fireworks with us.  I did get stuck in icky traffic on the way back, and everyone else managed to avoid it and get home 20 minutes sooner (considering we live only 15 minutes from base that tells you a lot of the traffic we were stuck in).    Anyway, that's the news... the weather is a little rainy.  :)

      I'm feeling depressed, cranky, etc today about my potential to finish my dissertation.  Up until recently, even though I hadn't been doing a ton of writing, I still felt that I  could  get it done, if I just sit down at the computer and apply myself.  This last couple of days, however, I've begun to entertain the idea of writer's block.  I KNOW that it is a pathetic term, and one that is cliched and overused to stand in for lazy, or uninspired, or something.  But I'm thinking that's maybe what's wrong with me.  I sit down to try to write, something that's always been very easy for me, and what I write sounds like such crap I write a few pages and quit.  Or I just stare at what I've already written, loathing it, contemplating life as an aerobics instructor or medical receptionist (it's a growing field, you know, according to all the TV commercials).    So what so what so what.  Maybe I should go back & get my teacher certification so I can teach high school.  Or ask Dr. B if I can have a full load of classes and if there is any way I can be hired as more than a temporary person.  Heavy disheartened sigh.

      I've changed my email address to try to stop the massive amounts of SPAM I was getting. But now I am not getting hardly anything, so it makes me paranoid that there's something wrong with my email.  Can I never be happy?  On another note, I'm teaching four classes this semester.  I'm very hectically busy-- about 100 students to remember and learn about and teach and yadda yadda.  I'm excited about them-- a couple of the classes have a really great vibe going already (even with minor amounts of interaction) so it should be a fun semester for those folks.    I should work-- I've been doing "teacherly" stuff all morning-- it's time to be student-girl.  I'm reading all about Foucault.  Ah, so I finally really understand what a darn epistemology is.  I have been, gasp, faking it for years.  :)

      Soon it will be time to go to someone else's house and suck the productivity out of them, too.  mwah ha ha ha.    I said suck. huh. huh.  huh.  Now I really really really will leave the computer, and go take a shower (since I never did work out today, I didn't get out of the workout clothes.  Usually that trick works-- put on the workout clothes and it will mean you will workout before you change. But not today).    But check out my new pictures on the  urlLink pictures  page, as well as a few new entries to the  urlLink about me  page.  You'll have to scroll down to the bottom of the pages.

      If I spend the entire day PLANNING to exercise, is that the same as actually doing it?    Or if I post yet another link to the many many ways in the world to waste time while waiting for your lunch (a Lean Cusine Dijon Beef Tips, thank you for asking) to digest, and then find that it's been too long and now I have to wait for dinner?  How about if I start my new leaf Tuesday (cause I have to work Monday?)     urlLink This is a useful and helpful addition to humanity's needs.   I found this addition to my definition of my webly-logy thing:  procrapstination: Procrastination while relocating--specifically, avoiding packing when you realize how much crap you have and try to figure out how much of it you can leave behind.  Example: After much procrapstination, Chris decided it would not be necessary to take along his entire scrap metal collection  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Procrastinitis: Condition in which employees or students are absent the day before an important project is due, inherently due to them putting the work off until the last possible minute.  Example: The student, stricken with Procrastinitis, remained home to finish the 4 page essay (the day before it was due).  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------  procrasturbater: someone who gets their kicks from putting things off  Example: I am a master at procrastibating, I'll tell you all about it later!

       My cat is a freak  Because I just spent several seconds torturing my neurotic cat with a hot neon pink mouse on a string.  She literally hid under the bed, and not in a "wow I want to play" way but in a "terrorists are invading, hide the children and Monex gold notes under the bed" way.  Poor little freak.  She wanted to play, and the mouse on a string looked like fun at Petsmart.  Apparently, it has all kinds of cat evil pheremones on it or something.  Maybe it's like the equivalent of a baby's head on a stick for me... who knows what kitty logic is in that furry little head of hers.  Nissa called-- apparently there may be a crisis in my home later as she might need to escape a family-related invasion of her home later.  As a good friend, I have told her that I a fully prepared to turn into a freak in need of therapy later so she has to say "oh, man, I'm sorry to leave you relatives I didn't want to hang out with anyway but my friend is having a nervous breakdown." Which we will then treat with vanilla vodka and a movie.   Ho-rah!!.   (that's Marine corps speak for yeah!)  Really, how many times can I use the modifier "later" in one short paragraph?

      Yes.  I have been editing my template again.  I think I finally have settled upon a color scheme that doesn't make me want to puke.  It's my favorite color (that garnet red) combined with a purpley shade that contrasts nicely.  Not so boring as white, but readable.  I will be editing the extra pages (the about me and pix) soon to reflect the color change.  I also I think fixed the link problem so that those links in the sidebar actually link to somewhere.  And I've spent several hours frolicking in other people's blogs having blog color & font envy.  But I will be me.  I will.  Just, later.  I did not, however, figure out how to make my archives pages the right colors.  This blog thing is sorta hard sometimes.  So now, to the gym, batgirl!

      I have been talking to people who read my blog, and it's clear to me that I should be doing more interesting and Mother Teresa sorts of things.  So this morning, after I went down to the orphanarium to feed the many orphans, I worked for a while on my cure for cancer.  It appears, on close study, that the side effect of the cure will be a cheap, renewalable, environmentally curing source of fuel.  Yes, it's been a productive morning.  :)  On the other hand, I got several whining emails from students this morning, who suddenly woke up and read their assignments and weren't listening in class when I told them to "mark off" the part about a section of the assignment I wasn't requiring them to do.  Is it just me, or is this semester the most annoyingest in recent  history?  I think it's me.  I think because I should be doing other things and I went ahead and convinced myself to teach anyway that I resent any second not spent either in something lazy & fun or something productive and leading to me finishing the dissertation. That includes teaching related activities.    Plan for the day:  Work out-- to try to get rid of the pint of Godiva Chocolate cheesecake ice cream I ate last night.   Do some paperwork:  work on grades for students.  You know, they ought to not annoy me on grading days.   Maybe a movie?  It IS Sunday after all.  A weekend.    Thank GOD it's almost the last week of school.

        Heavy Sigh    Andrew just left to go back to Shreveport.  We decided that I couldn't ride with him because tomorrow (Sunday) is going to be a really heavy air traffic day, and I'd likely get stuck in Dallas.  The next time we'll be together will be at Christmas break, I guess.  It's not too long, really!  So we've been making our holiday plans, or trying to, and deciding when to travel.  I think we'll probably go over to Florida around the 20th of December, then back here after Christmas and spend New Year's here, then he'll head back to S'port sometime a few days later (I'll go with him that time, and fly back here when he starts classes again.)  After January it'll be a little easier, cause I could go up there whenever it's convenient, since I won't be teaching.  As long as I'm working well on the dissertation.  Speaking of that, the dissertation fairies visited in my sleep last night-- I got some great ideas for how to work on the issue of feminism as choice (sort of) in the intro, and throughout.  It was an interesting dream, and I remember it very strongly.  I'll describe it another time, though, since I am feeling sad cause Andrew's leaving.  Please let the road trip be smooth and not trafficky for him, and let the Starbuck's all be open & the road angels be on point.  :)

      We're back home in post-Thanksgiving Andrew is here-ness.  It was a fun trip-- main anxiety was remembering WHICH exit the good Starbucks is at (exit 339) and whether it would be still open at 9 pm (yes, till 11).  :)    Today we're going to Nissa & Aaron's to watch some silly college football game.  I think it's some team like the Texas longeared cows, or something like that.  (Okay, if that doesn't get a comment I don't know what will).  Hey-- do I have any Aggie t-shirts?  I used to.  Where'd I put  'em?  Trouble.  With a capital T and that rhymes with P and that stands for p... um.  Something that starts with p.  :)  I made pie yesterday.  Homemade apple & pumpkin, and the pumpkin wasn't from a can, either.  Yummity yum yum.     One bad thing about today:  I have a damn cold sore.  I'm pretty sure one of my friends shared a marg with me at one point and passed their creepy cold sore virus to me.  I never used to have these stupid things!!!!!!!     One good thing about today:   Andrew is here.  :)

      Today I'm heading for Shreveport again, and no computer access.  Blee!  Maybe there is a computer cafe there somewhere that I'm not aware of yet-- I'll have to do some searching.  I hate being away for so long.  I am debating taking the laptop, but it's such a pain to carry on airplanes nowadays.    It's cold here today!  I know folks in other  areas of the country probably would say that 35 isn't so bad, but boy it's nipply!  I was going to say something intelligent, but now that I'm here, and haven't eaten breakfast yet, I can't think of anything remotely intelligent to say.  Ah well.  Not a big surprise.

Thanks to Daysleeper's query, I shouldered my trusty quest gear and headed out to find out how and why I couldn't find how to add comments to my blog.  I found the script, and as of just this five minutes ago, you, dear gentle reader, can comment on any of my blogs.  So comment away!  Procrastinate with me.

      okay, better.  I called & left an "I'm sorry" and a "just trust me" message on Andrew's voice mail before going to the gym.  So by the time I was done, he had dinner and I had worked out and we were fine and not cranky anymore.  It's never a bad bad argument, but I hate it when we do argue at all.  I think this blog, though, helped, cause I was able to articulate what I wanted to say before I said it, and emotions didn't really get in the way.  Yay blog!  I've also agreed to do some work on dissertation stuff tonight and later this week, even though I had sorta decided to put off work till the end of the semester.  But there's no real reason other than sheer greediness for "good books" to not work.

      I've been trying all day to avoid "crinkly forehead" syndrome because it's not attractive, and feels icky too.  I had managed to, today, in many ways-- mostly because I've made a plan to go visit Beth & her little baby, who I've never gotten to meet since Beth & hubby were out of the state when baby was born.  It seemed like a good idea to me!  I am socializing, yes, but I haven't seen her in years!    So I just told Andrew, and he got that "disapproving" voice people sometimes get and scolded me that I should be working on the dissertation in my "downtime."  Hmm.  I guess of all the people who bug me about the writing, Andrew is the only one truly & totally allowed to do so.  But I don't think he understands my feelings about this.  Having screwed up this whole Fall semester because of the teaching, my plans are to buckle down come the end of the month when school is totally out, and then get back to work.  Until then, I  could  do minor things-- BUT right now, I'm waiting to hear again from Dr. R about the changes I made last week to the proposal.  So until I hear from her, I'm not really ready to do any more writing.    I think part of what bugs me about this is the sensation that people don't trust me. Fine.  You get a phd and write your dissertation and you can tell me what my schedule ought to be.  (I know that sounds spiteful & bitter.  I'm feeling a little that way right this second.)  Gentle reader, I'm venting.    So to be scolded when I am perfectly honestly going to work my butt off come the middle of December, and my truest intention will be to be done with a draft by the end of this coming summer, and I really know it will happen, then I feel a little crinkly fore-head-y about the scolding.  a. I don't think I really deserve it and b. I forget what b was for.  I had something for "b" for a second there and now I've forgotten it.  So hence more vamp forehead action.  Was b maybe that I feel it's unfair to scold me on this?  I know he's got to be getting impatient-- but man oh man.  I think people don't really understand that nagging me about this ONLY serves to make me feel defensive and cranky and puts my back up and my tendency to resist what everyone else tells me to do gets activated.  Even when it's something I want and need to do.  I have to then fight my scorpio nature and get over it, but it ISN'T HELPFUL PEOPLE!!  While I'm still teaching too much, I really really need time on the weekend for myself!  Maybe Mr. Scoldypants is working and studying and being all good right now.  But he doesn't have anything else on the side-- his whole job right now is being a student.  Mine is being a teacher all friggin' week and I need some time to NOT do things, too.  Am I justifying?  Am I making excuses?  Maybe.  But I guess it's part of the difference between the way the two of us think about things.  He has to constantly plan and putter, whereas I just get it all done in these massively productive bursts of energy.  So just wait for the next burst, wouldja?  And don't hassle me till the burst doesn't happen.  Trust me when I promise it's coming.     Grrr. Argh.    Again.

I know it's early, but basically, I find that the Monday before the break I lose enough students that it's really pointless to have class, so I didn't schedule them on Monday.  So my first day off is tomorrow.  Yipeedee skippidee.  Really-- that's not sarcasm at all but sincere yippee ness.  After my day today, I really need a break.    I'm going with Nissa & Aaron to the Fox & the Hound (not the movie, the bar, thanks for asking) later to drink a bit.  Yum.  Maybe a Frangelicomartini.  MMMMM.    OOH.  I thought of a poem on the way home.  Like ta hear it here it go:            George Dubya George Dubya        where have you been?         I've been to London        to visit the queen.       George Dubya George Dubya       what'd you do there       watched protesters and pretended I didn't care.  Okay, I didn't say it was a good or even original poem.  I said it was a poem.  So.  You have to say it the Texas way "DUBya".  That way the rhyme scheme works.    So I'm listening to this new Bon Jovi CD that has "classic" Bon Jovi acoustically rendered.  "Livin' on a Prayer" has Olivia D'Abo on it, and at first I thought the womanly voice was John.  It was a little weird.  But I think I like it so far.   Finally, on "boob watch"-- yes, they're still irritatingly sore.  I wish I knew why! So that makes, what four, five days?  Cranky cranky.

      Also, why doesn't anyone to whom I write about how cool I think their blog is respond to me?  I always write back to people who tell me I'm cool.  I think they're less cool if they don't write back.  I take any nice things I said back if I don't hear from you within, oh, three days.  You have time to fill a blog with comments but not to write back to an admirer.  It's not like I'm asking you to write my frickin' dissertation for me.  I mean, if I asked you to do that and you didn't write back, I would understand.  But if I said "hey, you're cool" at least a THANK YOU would be nice.    Brownie countdown:  T-minus 1 h 30 min.

      After a few cranky cranky moments, and telling my early presentation students that under my smile I actually looked like the vamps in Buffy just before they eat you, I am feeling a lot better now. It may have had to do with food consumption-- I ate a good breakfast, but man was I cranky anyway!  One of my students cleverly bribed me with soy nut snack (her pres was on vegetarianism) and it started to boost my mood.  So here is the mental note:  apprently, when I am low on protein, I get vampire-y.  Good to know.  I wrote this in one of my notes while listening to presentations:  if I were to rip a student's head off and drink his/her blood, do you think that would affect my chances of one day getting tenure?  (Seriously.  I think it would actually help it).    Okay, hello, what part of not talking on your cell phone in the computer lab do 1. the student who is having a long conversation NOT understand and 2. the lab techs who are being PAID to monitor things like that NOT understand about their JOB!?!?!?!?!?  Apparently the vamping is not quite over.  ::she said, as she slowly pulled each hair out of said rude asshole's head.::

      Wow.  I can't believe how annoyed I am this morning at the littlest things.  I guess I may need to go open up those brownies NOW.  What, did the testosterone fairy visit me in the night?  Damn little pumped up thing.

       Grrr.  Arrgh.   This morning many people are giving me the crinkly forehead of doom.  I look like a vampire from  Buffy  (hence the grr argh).  Students who want to do last minute impossible things and who will get cranky WITH ME for not being able to miracle them up some internet access in the classroom, lab techs who arrive significantly LATE to their job thus making me WAIT many many minutes to get my own work done before slacking off and blogging, people who want me to give them FREE content for their PAID subscription website "in a few sentences".  Growl.  What's a line-reducing cream to do?  Good thing I have chocolate, frosting covered brownies in my office, and a pint of low-fat milk in the fridge upstairs.  Otherwise, I might be ready to rip someone's head off by the end of the day.  But other than all that, it's going well, thank you.

      Just finished King's new book,  Wolves of the Calla  and wrote a quick review for Amazon.com.  I really liked it!  It's a goodie-- a nice step on this long quest which creepily has taken me twenty years (or more!) to read.  I read the first Dark Tower book way way back when I lived in Abbeville, La.  Before my niece Sara was born, I think, which actually makes it more like 23 years.  Ugh!  I hate to admit that it's been that long!  I re-read them all a few years ago when Andrew bought them for me.  One of the things I mentioned in my amazon review was that I have not always loved every one of King's books.  A few I have actually stopped reading.  Nowadays, I tend to just not have the time to keep reading a book that I don't care for, that I can't get into after a few chapters.  But at the same time, it's such a pleasure to read a good one, and to then share it with Andrew (who will really like this, I think).  It ends a bit "cliffhanger" ish, but at least we won't have to wait too too long for the next installment.   I also bought a new cake pan, the Nordic ware sunflower pan, and a present for Nissa's Christmas party "white elephant" exchange.  I am happy about the present-- it's something I thought of getting last year but dawdled too long to buy in time for the party (it's a mail order thing.)  So yay!  I'm not sure Andrew will be here for the party but I will have to have some fun there.  Maybe even plan to spend the night if only to help with the cleanup since Aaron & Nissa usually help with our party clean ups.  That's the burden of the "reserved room."  :)    Anyway.  Now I have to decide if I should start on one of my new books or watch one of the movies I rented.  I'm thinking movie-- so I don't waste that money and turn them in unwatched.  I hate doing that!

      After some complanints about the teeny weeny eye-strain-o-vision font of my blog, I have taken steps to enlarge it slightly.  I think it is definitely more readable.  Something about it being so small was sort of cool, though.  But, the readers have spoken.

         Tituba likes the blog The cat is purring loudly on my lap.   Apparently, when I'm blogging, I don't wiggle in the cat-annoying way I do when I type  any thing else.  So she's a happy kitty.  I think she'll be happier when I put on my sexy new Victoria's Secret nightie (not because of the sexiness-- for god's sake she's a cat-- get your mind out of the gutter people!) but because it's time for bed and she'll lie on my feet and purrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr.  Kitties are cool.    Bedtime!

      Okay, so all is right with the world.  I managed to register my piddly little 1 research hour with only moderate cursing and yelling at the computer screen as I struggled to remember my password and username-- not the usuals, since I was required to use specific alpha numeric that don't fit my "norm."  EEEERP!  But eventually my brain sent me the proper combo.    Now, home, after having a successful pizza night (mmmmmm pizza).  And I've been told, the critics are in, and my blog is apparently funny (at least to people who know me.)  Ah.  I can rest.  All is right with the world.  I was going to make this snide comment about other really serious things comparing my happiness to REALLY SERIOUS (cue dramatic music) issues but then I thought it was a little too much.  So leave out issues, cue commercial for Organic Experience Shampoo.  And a Toys R We commercial.    Love love love.  All ya need is.    And the nips?  Yeah.  Still sore.

      Ugh.  I don't feel well again-- I think maybe I could be developing an ulcer from all that motrin use.  Thanks to modern chemistry I get to help myself with one problem and develop another.    Just adds to a lovely grey, rainy, making-me-cranky as hell day.

      I hate computers. I hate people who sit in computer labs dedicated to multiple users and chat loudly.  It all makes me cranky and I will take my wrath out on those who come into contact with me today.  For some reason unknown to all except the gods who hate me, I cannot log into the TAMU system to register, even though supposedly my account info is all activated and stuff.  Evil evil evil.  And the nice helpful message on the website is "to stop in to a lab and get your password fixed."  Oh yes.  Yes.  I am having a really really really annoying morning.  Already.    At least the irritating grad students who were TALKING have left the lab.  I send them jedi mind vibes that will cause them to register for undergraduate Spanish courses without their knowing why.  And they will sit next to two frat boys who say that adding "o" to the end of an English word makes it Spanish.  Coolo.  Righto.  Myo wratho iso complete o.   mwah ha ha o.

      I'm at school right now blogging while in my office hours.  I really should be grading student proposals & stuff but I don't feel like it.  The blogger admin posted an  Onion  story about a 30 year old whose mom found his blog, and he's freaked cause now she'll know details about his life (I never can figure out-- is the  Onion  sometimes serious or all satire?)  I don't really worry at all about the mother-unit finding this blog, but if the "Ivory Tower" saw how much I complain about teaching duties (heh heh, I said duties) then I could be in trouble.  I dunno-- maybe it's really better to cultivate this sort of attitude-- I mean, all the great writers who taught all pretended to hate it, right?    Ooh.  Must remember to register for research hours!  No repeat of last semester's nightmare.

           Get Drunk! by Charles Baudelaire  Get Drunk and stay drunk!       That's it!       The great imperative       In order not to feel       Time's horrid burden       bruise your shoulders,        grinding you into the earth,        Get drunk and stay that way.       On what?       On wine, poetry, virtue, whatever.       But get drunk.       And if you sometimes happen to wake up       on the porches of a palace,       in the green grass of a ditch,       in the dismal loneliness of your own room,       your drunkenness gone or disappearing,       ask the wind,       the wave,       the star,       the bird,       the clock,       ask everything that flees,       everything that groans       or rolls       or sings,       everything that speaks,       ask what time it is;       and the wind,       the wave,       the star,       the bird,       the clock       will answer you:   "Time to get drunk!"        Don't be martyred slaves of Time,       Get drunk!       Stay drunk!   On wine, virtue, poetry, whatever!"

       irritating children, basketball & revenge as a cold dish   I guess this will come back to haunt me someday, perhaps, especially if god is particularily interested in something like irony.  The children who live near me annoy me greatly.  They play basketball all friggin' night while I am trying to quietly read &/or get drunk. (Get drunk & stay drunk!)  Bounce.  Bounce.  Bounce.  Thud.  Bounce Bounce bounce.  Thud.  Whack.    For hours  Shouldn't they be doing homework or something INSIDE and QUIET?  I know.  I sound like a cranky old woman.  But when I'm trying to listen to birds chirp & watch the geese fly overhead in the twilight purple and honk ever so much like a volkwagon with a loose wiring thingy, the BOUNCE of basketballs is highly irritating.    I find myself trying the Jedi mind trick:  you want to go inside and watch The Simpsons one hour special.   And then: "your brain suddenly implodes and you lie writhing QUIETLY on the pavement, your basketball shrunken and pierced under your quietly breathing grand mal body".    I'm pretty sure I'm a cranky old woman.

       Song & Silence You know, in a book I liked (I loved the first in the series, liked the one I'm talking about) by Suzette Haden Elgin, she has this thing about song being for humans like light is for plants-- a way to literally get energy-- food.  I think in a much less literal way that's true.  I love music-- love to listen to the radio cranked up with music from rap to Hank Williams sr. to classical.  But sometimes, it's really important, I think, to turn the noise off.  If it becomes noise, just turn it off rather than trying to find something that doesn't suck as much as the rest.  This afternoon that's how I feel.  I've turned off all the noise boxes in the house, and there are birds singing and dogs whining.  I don't exactly love the dog whining, but it is important to realize, I guess, that there are somewhere creatures that are miserable in the lack of company, or food, or something.  Quiet is good.  I feel refreshed and strengthened by it.    On the drive home, there was another one of those nature moments that the Romantics loved-- awesome beauty.  Overwhelming and so breathtaking that if it were a painting, you would think it was just too much.  There was this really dark cloud, hanging very low on the horizon, but it was big-- just not the whole horizon.  And over it was the sun, in as much glory as the setting autumn sky can grant.  It was "squinty" bright-- hot white nuclear bright.  But just under it, soaking up that nuclear whiteness was this dark cloud.  It was a study in contrasts that made me think that we are often defined best by our opposite-- the light is only truly light when it is almost (but not quite) absent.    Now I've had a wonderful dinner & a good book and am about to go lie in the hammock while the light keeps and read with a glass of Merlot.  Happy sigh.

       Two good things and two bad ones about today:  Good things: 1.  I'm wearing a new t-shirt that really makes me happy.  It's black, with white "handwritten script" lettering that messily says "your lips keep moving but all I hear is " urlLink BLAH, BLAH, BLAH..."   Complete with proper punctuation.  Happy sigh.   2. I love Rhapsody's music service!  I'm listening to the new Sarah McLaclan album, and yes, it's kinda nice, but no, I don't wanna buy it.  What's cool about Rhapsody is that for 10 bucks a month (cheaper than the CD's I might buy wondering-- will I like it? but that radio never lets me in on) I can listen to most songs, then decide without buying a CD which will languish in the CD cabinet in the living room forever.  Happy.  And so it ultimately saves me money cause I only buy those songs and/or CDs I want.    Bad Things: (these sort of fall into the TMI category, so if you can't take it, skip) 1.  My boobs hurt, for some inexplicable reason.  It's not apparently hormonal, but they are sore and my nipps very sensitive, and not in a good way.  Most likely it IS hormonal, but in one of those "let's spring it on her after 20 years of thinking she's got this what it means to be female thing down" sort of way.  Pffffhhht.   2.  also sort of personal and TMI:  it's really annoying to have a pimple at the same time as I have crow's feet starting to show up in the corners of my eyes.  I know, I know.  "They're laugh lines."  Baugh!  I shake my age-defying moist cloth in defiance and irritation at the world.  I know pimples aren't really a sign of youth, especially those that show up around the lip line.  But it's just not fair to be old and young at the same time.  :- p'

        Hello from tangent-ville.    Okay, so on TRIO they also have this show in the "brilliant but cancelled" category called   urlLink God, the Devil and Bob  .  It's a cartoon where God is thinking about destroying the world (again) and decides to give us a second chance if he can find one righteous man. (I'm going to stick with the masculine pronoun here cause in the show, God is shown as male-- even though I think God has no need for biological gender).  He "lets the devil in on the bet" by letting him pick the man (which the devil clearly tries to win the bet by picking an imperfect man who the devil is sure will screw it all up).  The show got into all kinds of trouble, and eventually was cancelled, partly because Christians objected to it as blasphemous and evil.  I really wish that folks would concentrate on things in the world that I think are truly evil on TV-- a few jokes about religion are a bit less troublesome (IMHO) than the dozens of murders a day one can see on basic TV.    One problem people had with it was they claimed God would never do something like that.  Hello!  Can you say Book of Job?  In that book, God basically makes a bet with the devil around Job's faith.  It's in the bible, you know.  So it's not like this is much of a stretch to imagine being a possibility.  Of course, some Christians have always had difficulty with aspects of Job's story.  Anyway.    My point is-- I think the show was really funny, and always quite on target with the basic intelligent person's theology.  God gives us free will.  This is why we get in trouble-- we often know we shouldn't do something bad but do it anyway because we are imperfect. God could have literally (at least, an ominpowerful god) caused humanity to NOT have choices, and then that whole Garden of Eden thing would have not happened, right?  But God allows choice, and that includes the choice to do bad things.  Think of  A Clockwork Orange -- the "choice" to be evil is taken away from the protagonist, and so whe he is "Good" it is meaningless!  Only when that person is "good" because they WANT to be good does it mean anything!!  But ultimately, most people are pretty darn good.  Don't go around kicking puppies and stuff but really wanting to make the world a better place.  And I think God and the point of being here has a lot to do with that philosophy-- make the world better than it was when you woke up this morning, even if only in a small way.  So I'm digressing and getting into bad argument zone because I'm getting sidetracked.    But my point about this whole darn thing is this:  the show was cancelled, partly because religious folks objected to its message, thought it was blasphemous to show God chatting with (and making a bet with) the devil.  And that God is shown drinking beer (for pete's sake!) And that the graphical image of God is shown apparently to look like Jerry Garcia (I'm not sure this was deliberate on the part of the show's makers-- honestly, he has a white beard and mustache.  That's a traditional image of God!  Jerry Garcia was a lot heavier-- he wore certain kinds of clothes.... God basically looks like an older man with a mustache & beard who has liberal hippie tendencies).  Perhaps he does look and perhaps the creators meant him to look like Garcia.  It's not like he looks like Jeffrey Dahmer or something-- what did Garcia do that was so evil?  Oh yes, he was human & flawed and did stupid things that eventually caused his life to end.  That doesn't sound like ANYONE I know.  It was really upsetting to me to look around on the net and find only ridiculously illogical, non-specific arguments about how evil the show was.  Often these arguments were circular (the show is bad cause it shows God being blasphemous and that's blasphemous of the network and they're going to Hell.)   Another thing these "critiques" on the net show was arguments that completely forgot things like JOB.    One website went down the list of its objections to the show, including things like that Noah was perfect and didn't drink (did you forget that Genesis  urlLink 9:22-23  shows Noah drunk and naked lying about in his tent?  This is the whole thing that gets his son Ham in trouble, and ends up being used by bad theologians in the past as justification for slavery).  So the point is that even a "perfect" man, chosen by God to save a piece of humanity (that is otherwise seen as beyond salvation and drowned) has human imperfect moments.  The whole claim that the show is immoral merely because they show God drinking a beer is really a stretch.  They show God saying "how did we live without Starbucks" too.   Should we condemn the show for that reason cause coffee is a stimulant, too.  And Starbuck's is corporate, clearly evil, right?  Making the world all liberal and hippie minded like those Northwestern Washington types.  (yeah. right.)  Drinking is one of those places that people like to get up on a soapbox and say "the bible clearly says" it's bad.  Well that's not true.  There are other places that it "clearly" says  urlLink other things  about drinking.  I personally think the point is NOT TO DRINK IN EXCESS!!  All of the places people like to quote about alcohol being EVIL really to me are interpretable as statements against OVER indulging.  One does not get "red eyed" drunken-ness from a glass of wine, or even two.    Again, I'm getting off point.  What bugs me about narrow-minded bad arguments like this?  Really?  Is that technically I am a Christian, a believer in God.  (Granted, I think I have very liberal views and I doubt that many of the folks who wrote those websites would think I am anything other than bad).  What bugs me is that these folks succeed, all the time, in ruining shows like this one because they CLAIM to be a moral authority on what God would like.  What DOES God think about things like sin?  Well, even from a Christian standpoint, God allows a way out of it-- so yes, it's wrong, but it's not like there's no chance of redemption.  In theology, I think there is ALWAYS a chance to redeem oneself.  And we can never know, even if we think Jerry Garcia was bad and therefore the show is bad cause it shows God looking like him, that in his heart, Garcia wasn't "right with the Lord."  How, really, do you know that?  Are you claiming to be omniscient?    I don't think so bub.  The Bible also condemns hypocrisy.  If you're claiming to be so righteous that you can firmly and authoritatively say that YOU are the only right person, I think you're committing quite a sin yourself.  You might be surprised to find out that you are not an authority on what God thinks, and claiming to do so is a bit of a stretch on your part.    But then again, I could be wrong.  Maybe those folks really are right, and God really is so narrow-minded and caught in the 19th century Puritanical view of everything in the world that is "fun" is sinful.  If so, well, I reckon it's really only me who will suffer from my wrong-beliefs.  Those folks will be happily hanging out with that God in heaven.  In this, I believe in the Billy Joel song "I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints, the sinners are much more fun". Funny how Jesus hung out with a lot of sinners, huh.

      So here's where I get all theoretical on you.  The show I'm watching just did the bit on gender-- talking about how feminists will get offended by things like being called a chick or a bitch or whatever.  I remember I was on this feminist listserv a long time ago and I made a joke, off the list, to this woman about "sacraficing a virgin CD rom" to the computer gods for her computer to work.  She got TOTALLY offended, and said something about virgins usually being women, and that I was really inappropriate.  I mean, for god's sake-- I WAS TALKING ABOUT A COMPUTER!!!!  So I said something about it being a joke, and that I thought that was one of the problems with feminism-- that it didn't have a sense of humor.  And that even got me in trouble, labeled a "Bad feminist" because "that sort of thing is always used against women."  I love it, when I think about it.  All the things that hurt feminism are that so many of "us" fall victim to this mentality that allows others to have power over us even as we insist they shouldn't.  If I get offended you calling me a bitch or a 'ho, don't I admit to you that there is something true about those words, and something true to you being superior to me?  If I say "yes, ha, that's funny?" don't I potentially weaken your power over me, and take my own power over my own ability to define myself?    Last night, at the piano bar, when they were singing Margaritaville and the line "but I know, it's a woman's fault" or something like that, the piano player pointed at me.  Ha!  I'm sure he thought I'd get all uppity and/or deny it.  I shook my head, yes, yes, I did it.  Raised my hand like, "oh yeah, that was me."  I think he was a tiny bit thrown.  Because probably his "pat" response to that is to make fun of the woman who protests it wasn't her fault.  I didn't apologize either.  Yes, I did it.  Thanks!  Have a nice day.  Then he ended the bit with a "she's accepting responsibilty for it" sort of joke.  But it didn't really win HIM the points.  I got them.  I was the one who "stole that show" in a sense.  And if I were the type to take offense at a Virgin CD Rom computer joke, I would probably think Jimmy Buffet was being a misogynistic bastard for blaming women for his missing salt shaker.  Women are sometimes our own worst enemies.  And even as I type that, I worry that someone somewhere is going to complain that I'm a bad feminist for saying that.  Well I say bad feminists are the ones who say there are "proper" things we are allowed to say or not say.

      I'm in the middle of watching this show on TRIO called  urlLink Uncensored Comedy:  That's Not Funny.    It's really interesting; it deals with comedy that has pushed buttons over the years, from Amos & Andy to ?  It's not quite halfway through and very interesting.  I think they're about to move from talking so much about race & into gender, cause it's about to do Andrew Dice Clay.  I think it's interesting cause this is a show that's techinically "educational."  If I were in high school, I'd wanna nap.  But then, in high school, they either wouldn't show this or bleep everything offensive and therefore make it dull.

      Well yesterday was neat.  I hadn't really realized that the "Saturday night" stuff we were going to do was my birthday celebration.  We went to the new Pat O'Brian's on the Riverwalk.  It seems weird to have one of those places NOT in New Orleans.  But it was pretty cool-- they have this piano bar with dueling pianos and everyone sings sappy stupid songs.  It's totally corny & my teenage self would have thought it the lamest thing in the world.  But my inner drag queen likes to sing sappy lame songs loudly in public.  And a lot of other people have inner drag queens too.  You see them gesturing like they were Liza Minelli.  Mwah ha ha.    But I got some nice presents, and we had a cake to die for!  I missed my Andrew, but other than that, it was the best birfday in a long time.

      I am off to Starbuck's where I can write and work on my proposal corrections without distractions.  Like this blog. And the cat who is meowing annoyingly at my feet.  By the end of the day, I will have something done!!

      Morning shmorning. I got up early so I can go work out before my long hair appointment.  It's all vanity-- I don't want to work out after the hair appt. cause you always have good hair after a visit to the salon and I don't wanna mess it up with a later workout.  Ah the concessions I make to be buff & have great hair.  Whoda thunk it long ago when I barely even wore makeup and my favorite thing to do was lie around doing nothing?  ::thinks of pensive things::  Today my plan is to take my proposal to Starbucks & work there.  Since I've been blogging & posting to the Gaiman board too much at home, I feel that I need some non-Cable modem connected computer time.  I'm gonna try it.  I think it'll work, as long as that "I'm a guy talk to me" guy doesn't come to the shop and bug me.  There's this line in  To the Lighthouse  by Virginia Woolf that reminded me of, where the woman painter is painting and this guy walks up and she knows he'll want her to pay attention to him. I'll have to look up the exact words, but I remember thinking of that when mustache-feeling guy showed up the first time.  Anyway.

      Okay, so instead of doing dissertationly things, I was surfing blogs.  On  urlLink Mr. Furious'  blog, he had this " urlLink Belief O Matic " quiz, which I just took too.    This is me:  1.      Unitarian Universalism  (100%) 2.      Neo-Pagan (97%) 3.      Liberal Quakers  (84%) 4.      Mainline to Liberal Christian Protestants  (84%) 5.      Mahayana Buddhism  (83%) 6.      New Age  (81%) 7.      Secular Humanism  (75%) 8.      New Thought  (73%)  9.      Theravada Buddhism  (67%) 10.   Christian Science (Church of Christ, Scientist)  (66%) 11.   Scientology  (64%)  12.   Hinduism  (63%)  13.   Reform Judaism  (63%)  14.    Taoism  (60%)  15.   Jainism  (59%) 16.   Bah&aacute;'&iacute; Faith  (58%) 17.   Sikhism  (51%) 18.   Orthodox Quaker  (45%) 19.   Nontheist  (45%) 20.   Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormons)  (41%) 21.   Mainline to Conservative Christian/Protestant  (35%) 22.   Orthodox Judaism  (33%) 23.    Jehovah's Witness  (25%) 24.   Islam  (23%) 25.   Seventh Day Adventist  (18%) 26.   Eastern Orthodox  (16%) 27.   Roman Catholic  (16%)  And while I'm not at all surprised about the Neo-Pagan showing up so high, and a few of the others, I am surprised about Quakers and that Mormonism even shows up above the last one at all!  I think Roman Catholic is so low cause of my feelings on abortion & homosexuality.  But it's interesting.  I'm going off now to look up the #1 category.

        PLEASE GOD MAKE HIM STOP!!!   I went to lunch with Andrew's dad and some other folks.  We went to the Luby's at the mall (a cafeteria style place). There was this horrible horrible new edition to this Luby's-- this old man who played a portable electronic keyboard and sang.  He had dozens of hats, and would put on one of the hats as apparently appropriate to the song he was currently singing. I say apparently because the songs were SO bad and SO out of tune and SO TERRIBLE HERE COMES THE APOCALYPSE like that the only tune I could make out was the one that I think is about the war of 1812.. (fired our guns and they came a runnin')......   he wore this floppy "cowboy" hat for that-- although if it was the war I'm thinking about, a cowboy hat wouldn't fit.  Still.  So when apparently part of the song there would be gunshots, he banged loudly on the table.  Over and over again.  I began thinking wistfully of real gunshots, which would allow me to run screaming from the restaurant like I wanted to without embarassing the poor old guy, who clearly was trying to make a living in some way.  And he began to notice, after a while, that people were trying desperately to talk over him, so he got louder.    Honestly, I don't really even play the piano and by banging randomly on keys and howling out songs, I could have done better.    He had a large jar of "tips" with a lot of money in it.  I think people were paying him to stop, only they didn't have the heart to tell him "please stop."  It's like a terrible car crash-- you really just want to avoid talking or thinking about it, but it is there and horrible and you're stuck right next to it trying to eat your Salmon patty and corn and salad as fast as possible.    But at least it makes for a good blog entry.  I kept thinking:  I must record this.  But really, I can't possibly convey how awful it was.

      Now that I'm looking at it in the light of day, my email to my student looks sappy, over-wrought and something.  But really, I remember asking teachers who I liked to critique my poems, and they didn't really help any.  Now that I'm the teacher, I kind of know why (it's something you REALLY REALLY REALLY don't want to do because student poems are almost always not good).  Of course, mine were.  :)     So I sort of regret posting it here.  But I'm not gonna take it away. I feel sort of Rilke-esque.  So there.

        Snatch this poem from my hand    I just sent this email off as a response to a student who wanted me to critique his poem:   First.  Keep your passion. Don't ever let ANYONE convince you that you aren't right and they are wrong.  But at the same time, listen to the advice of people who have nothing to gain.  Sometimes, it tells you something about the world.  Most people won't speak honestly about poetry.  I try to, because I get so many people writing un-interesting stuff to my website.  Okay.  On the poem.  I assume you're asking me cause you want to improve. You want to learn.  You'll never learn if people are just nice to you.  It's a nice poem.  But do you want to be nice?   Love poetry is pretty well a popular format.  I would say, honestly, that what you've written doesn't offer something new that I haven't heard before. To be brutally honest (you asked me to, so don't feel too abused, please, as a poet, I know you'll say "she sucks.  Doesn't know what she's talking about."  But listen a little.) How is your poem different from a Hallmark card?  We don't want to aspire to be hallmark writers, generally.  yes, they might make a lot of money, and if that's what you're going for, GO FOR IT. But if you're going for art, something that makes a mark on the world beyond the card someone reads and tosses in the garbage with the rest of the wrapping paper:   How can YOU change my perspective of the world? Make me think:  Wow.  I've NEVER seen it that way before.  ???  The surrealist/modern painters imagined a view from multiple lenses.  Imagine if you were looking at a naked woman walking down a staircase from a fly's eye? From more than a 3 d perspective?  From maybe a 50 d perspective, where you could see every angle flat at once?  How would it look? urlLink  http://www.emory.edu/ENGLISH/Paintings&Poems/nude.jpg    Here's a poem about it:  urlLink http://www.cs.rice.edu/~ssiyer/minstrels/poems/1230.html  Look at art.  Look at other people's poetry.  Even if you hate their work, know it. Know how to change it. How can you express the new and unique perspective of *yours* in writing?  Learn the rules TODAY.  Then learn how to break them.  urlLink http://www.poets.org/index.cfm    What is it you have to say that is new, or different about love?  Most modern poets no longer try to force their poetry into a rhyme scheme, preferring instead to use the lines as a way of emphasizing specific thoughts.  You can "end" a line or begin one to start off a thought:  see:   urlLink http://cj.colliertech.org/?menu_item_id=71     a poem by ee cummings (which I suspect you'll like). See how he plays with line endings?  Read the poem out loud.  Experiment with actually ENDING your voice when the line ends.  See how it flows/and/or fails to FLOW?  This is also an answer to your query on "how sexual innuendo works in academe".  Only slyly.  How many folks do you think have imagined love as a game?  Is that a fairly common idea? Could you, instead of starting off with this basic idea, instead imagine a specific type of game? Or perhaps love as something ELSE?   Poetry is really hard.  I rarely write stuff I show to anyone else anymore, because I'm a bit of a cynic about my own work.  But mostly, what modern audiences are interested in is something that makes you see it from a new angle, something we hadn't thought of before on our own.   Read this:   urlLink http://projects.ups.edu/engl/203/cpfahl/padgett_nothing.htm  Then read this other interpretation of the same "poem."  urlLink http://projects.ups.edu/engl/sp2001/203a/scockett/March%201.htm   Then listen to it:     urlLink http://sofasamosa.tripod.com/   this is read by the poet.  Does something change for you in the REALLY bizarre, simplistic reading of a simple line by hearing it?  Finally, to write poetry, you MUST read lots of poetry.  Discover for yourself where your style fits.  What are you doing?  Who are you like? How are you different from them?   Poetry is the bouillon of the world.  It needs to be as POWERFUL as putting a literal chunk of chicken bouillon on your mouth.  (Do it if you've never. Try veggie if you need vegetarian).  That's poetry.  Do it.  But finally, realize that I might be totally wrong.  Do what you feel.  If you feel it, it doesn't matter who loves it or anything.  Write and you will learn.  Grasshopper.

       Maybe it's just the glass of Merlot talking   You know, now and then, you (me) think about things.  Stuff.  Like when Andrew met me, I was barely ready to start college, had just FINALLY dumped the big giant loser high school boyfriend.  I was living at home with mom and sister and her kids.  Pretty lame in many ways.  I mean, I had all these goals-- college, etc, but no real way to think about getting those goals done.  It isn't really Andrew, but after I met him, I was always too ashamed to be so lazy that I procrastinated the hell out of getting the college stuff started so I did it.  Now I'm procrastinating a PhD.  I mean, think of all the things I've actually accomplished in spit of the procrastination!!!!  He had done so much already, at a mere 27 (which seemed old then, god help me).  And now, I look around the little nest he's built for me, with my cute black kitty cat meowing at me, and  King of the Hill  seeming like it is saying something intense.    Okay.  I'm pretty sure it IS the Merlot.  But I love you guys.

      Why is it that when I'm in the car, I can think of so many witty and clever things to say but by the time I get home all I can come up with is a bad Andy Rooney impression?  I've decided I will speak for the rest of the day like the guy with the indeterminately foreign accent on the chiropratic commercial that was just on TV. It's too bad you can't hear me.  I'm very very funny sounding.  And I'm talking to myself, which is really frightening.  Don't tell Nissa; she might commit me to the "after five/before five" ward.    I watched the Simpsons-- the fabulous  Streecar Named Desire  episode.   Is it sad, weird, creepy, or cute that Homer reminds me in many ways of my sweet baboo?  All the good ways and a few of the bad ones.  :)

      Okay, new day, new dollar.  I'm teaching today, and I've spent the morning grading.  Back when I decided I wanted to be a teacher, I never knew how much grading papers suck.  I really like talking about books, and even teaching people how to write essays & learn stuff about grammar and style and formatting and stuff.  (note:  the overuse of the word "stuff" signifies my complete lack of brain power after grading all day.  Just live with it).  But I HATE assigning grades.  It's partly the whole laziness thing cause it takes forever to grade.  But another part is that I do know that a lot of students do tons of work and get poor grades just cause they're not good writers, and a lot of students take 20 minutes and get a good grade cause they're just naturally gifted at writing.  There are universities that assign only a "pass" and "fail" grade, and I kind of like that idea.  But how do they know how/what to improve?  I guess in that case I'd still be doing all the writing on their papers and making changes & suggestions, and revision would be important, but I wouldn't have to make the distinctions between an 89 B+ and a 79 C+.  They'd both be passes, just one would be better written.    ::le sigh::  Anyway.  I'm exhausted-- it's physically draining to sit at a desk and grade 50 essays.  Pffffhhhttt.  Piffle.  Blech.  Ick.  And other one-syllable words that denote tiredness and irritation.    Now I get to spend a day listening to oral presentations.  Joy.

       Oh make me over, I'm all I wanna be, a walking study, in demonology   On the way to the gym, I pass this beauty salon every day and often have to stop in traffic light traffic.  I am not sure whether they're being funny or not.  I think they're actually being serious-- the salon is called "God's Gift."    Now, do they think that it is a gift from God to be beautiful and therefore to fake it up nice with some beauty products? (hello vanity-- seven deadly sins).  Or, is it a joke on "you must think you're God's Gift"?    I can never decide.  But based on the way the shop is located, and the lack of any other indicators, I really think they think that they're somehow a Christian beauty salon.  It makes me laugh.  Not that Christians can or can't be beautiful and go to salons-- but that there is a bit of a contradiction there in calling it that.  Or am I just being a heathen again?

      Okay so now a new day and a new blog.  I'm afraid I have nothing really interesting to say here.  What do bloggers who do nothing during a day really talk about?  I guess some people can write about just anything and make it interesting.  Oh, I guess I could write about my student who thinks he's the next frickin' Larry Flynt, who wrote me a totally inappropriate essay and I told him to rewrite it and then I get this email from him "debating" it.  Harumph. I told him it was NOT open for debate.  I'm not against porn within a proper context, but that context is NOT my classroom, thank you very much.  These kids have seen  Clueless  too many times and think that they can negotiate their grades.  No way, no how.  Not only that, but I'm a much better negotiator than they are.  So don't get me started buddy boy.  I mean, if Larry Flynt was in my first year Comp course, I would tell him the same damn thing.  "Look Larry, love that publishing empire you got there.  Good work with the First Ammendment and all.  That story on Falwell-- funny.  But don't write it in here.  Give me something about your family's old home, or trees or something."  and then I'd say "Hey Larry, can I borrow 100 bucks?"  No, probably not that last part.   My boss probably wouldn't want me to borrow money from a student.     Angst!!  Terrible angst!  My blog is uncool and boring!!!!   (that last should be said in a Golem voice.  Precioussssss.)

      Okay. Because my tummy really is upset (I think it was the milk in the coffee at the coffee bar where the DN (dancing nerds) are I'm going to say one more quick thing before I forget it and then go take a nap.   This afternoon on the drive home   the song 867-5309 was playing.  Yay! then that song I don't like by Avril Levigne came on and I caught myself singing to it.  Boo!  In Texas at this time of year, you often get these really cool cloud moments.  The cloud cover is fairly thick, but it has these bumpy holes here and there.  And the sun blasts these spotlights of white sunbeam through the holes and you expect to look over and see the hand of god reaching through or something.  There were dozens of these white-hot sunbeams blasting the highway in front of me through mottley grey clouds on the way home.  I drove through one of the sunbeams that was strongest.  It was one of those nature-highs that I don't think a lot of people notice.  And if they do, it's only to put sunglasses on and complain of the glare.   But for me, I say "yay ::insert deity of choice::"!  Now.  To nap.  Pizza night is officially cancelled due to queasy tummy action.  Pfffhhhttt.  We will be serving after the nap a nice chicken soup from a can and maybe some sparkly water.

       Oh, yeah.  On procrastination and my Blogger-envy   Okay, I thought I was doing this procrastination thing pretty well.  I mean, I've really been putting off my dissertation, which means putting off a real job, putting off having kids, putting off being a serious adult.  Getting the big bucks and being able to shop at Ann Klein (and not the outlet) all the time and buy whatever shoes I want.  Having a honest-to-god shoe closet someday.  But apparently other people are better at this procrastination thing than I am. I can't believe it!  I have to   work harder at procrastinating!    Thus, I have posted numerous blogs today, and have walked around campus feeling smug and clever.

       Nerd Watch   This is probably going to get me landed in Hell one day.  But still, it's worth it.  Today's Nerd Report: TSN (or, Tall Skinny Nerd) wearing:  beigetones plaid overshirt, khaki shorts, tennis shoes SCN (or slightly chubby nerd) wearing:  navy blue t-shirt, jeans (faded), tennis shoes.  I think they're New Balance.  They're grey.    The two nerds were dancing away, all happy like.  Then as I was leaving, they did a TANDEM dance.  Wow.  I wonder, do they go out to clubs where all the "hotties" are and say "let's try that thing we learned on the karaoke game today"?    I got all excited about my nerd watch idea and wanted to take notes on what they were wearing but I didn't have a pen.  So I had to get down here to the lab as soon as my class ended and type this.  Sigh.  I feel so much better now.

       Dancing Nerds   I wanted to quickly mention the dancing nerds.  There is this spot on campus, the rec room sort of place (what do the kids call em nowadays anyway?).  They have one of those dance/karaoke machines where you pick a song then dance around on sensors to the music and win the game by doing it really well and dancing.  There are these two guys who are there every time I go there, and they dance away.  They are not at all graceful; they do not look like they'd pick up the hotties at a club dancing this way. In fact, dare I say it, they are nerds.  One is the skinny tall nerd and one is the slightly portly nerd.  (Since I myself am a nerd, I don't feel bad about calling them what they are.  So there.  Take it or leave it).  I watch them all the time, and they dance away, getting all the moves "technically" right and making the machine yell "way to go"  and "wow."  It's funny because most of the time they don't draw a crowd; no one seems to notice them, although I'm sure they think they are really cool and OUGHT to draw a crowd.  In their minds, they're wearing that white leisure suit and pointing at the ceiling and will one day make a fabulous comeback in  Pulp Fiction .  The other day, there  was  a cute girl sitting there watching them though.  And another time I saw a small crowd watching.  I'm not sure if the crowd thought they were cool or not.  There was some muttering, and I think I heard the phrase "burn em" once or twice.  So they might have been one of those sorts of crowds. (I just made that last part up, for effect, to make my blog more interesting.  Hee hee).      But the nerds, ah the nerds.  Ah.  nerds. You silly silly nerds.

       Kim and the Portrait of Dorian Grey (Gray?  How is that spelled anyway?)   It was my birthday last Saturday.  I turned 34, yes, I am not ashamed to say it.  I'm not at all ashamed of my age-- just the little tell-tale signs of aging that I really did not expect to turn up yet.  Like, for example, the white hair just at the top of my part that is currently sticking straight up waving its little flag of surrender to everyone who peers closely with a magnifying glass at my head, saying "Kim's gettin' old and needs to go to the hairdresser."  That darn hair.  I know that I am probably THE ONLY ONE who sees it.  But I cut it off, instead of pulling it out.  I'm on to that little thing my  mom used to say about "if you pull a gray hair out, 7 more come to its funeral."  So instead of killing the thing, I regularly amputate it very short and make it lie there suffering.  Mwahahahahahahahaaha ha.    Anyway, before I got distracted by my stupid gray hair, I was talking about my birthday.  I did not do anything really exciting.  Andrew & I got up, lay about his apartment aimlessly, (I think we watched the  Animatrix -- or was that some other lazy day?)  We ate breakfast, went to the gym (I am superwoman with big muscles.  Hear me roar.)  Then we went out and bought the ingredients for me to make a KICK ASS lasagna some cookies & some ben & jerry's.  Watched a movie ( Bend it like Beckam -- which is really sweet & funny & worth watching).    I did mention to Andrew several times how lucky he was.  I didn't even demand new sparklies.  Although the guy in the other movie we watched (Sunday morning) sent sparklies to his daughter.  You can read other posts to see what movie that was.  See, I'm building suspense and fabulous interest in my blog by not telling you.  (insert another evil laugh here).    Blog blog.  That sort of sounds like a dirty word, doesn't it? I'm sure that's not at all an original thought.  But that's me, not original, typing away here where it is time to go to lunch.   Today I'm having either a Lean Cuisine Oriental Pot Sticker meal or Lean Cuisine Santa Fe Rice.  And a sparkling lime water.  Yumm yummity yum.  Speaking of students (I know, I wasn't).  But there's one in the lab right now from a class that doesn't meet in here finishing up her paper which is officially due in two hours.  I suppose if she's coming in here to FINISH the work, it's not so bad.  But I'm all depressed that they wait so long and I constantly catch them at it.  They just better not try that "I worked all weekend on it" thing on me cause I'm onto 'em.

      Why oh why are other people's blogs so much cooler than mine?  I'm having a serious case of blog envy right now.  So in that spirit, I'm sitting in the lab where my students are type type typitying away on their manuals, and I am avoiding much important work by blogging my little heart out.    I should probably not talk about students in here.  Cause they might find it, and then decide that I'm a mean old witch for talking about them.  Well I am a  mean old witch (not old, really, just older than them) but it has nothing to do with this blog.  Mwah hahahahahahaha ha.  (that's my evil mad scientist laugh.  Cool, huh?)   Andrew is being anxious again about things like money, careers, job security.  I say screw it!  I've lived in trailer parks before and I know that given the worst case scenario, I would have the best-lookin' trailer in the park.  That's really something to shoot for, right?  Okay, now I'm feeling depressed about what I just wrote.  But I was just going for a sort of "glass is half full" approach that really isn't working out.    No matter how hard I try, I apparently cannot write the witty self-mocking yet terribly funny way that other people's blogs are written.  So I will go for my usual whineyness.  It's worked this long.

      Okay, so today I have graded all my students' papers, including their homework grades.  They will find out today how much NOT doing their homework affects their overall grade, and I'll have a dozen of them whining about it.  What gets to me is that they don't care enough during the regular course of the semester to keep up with their homework & the syllabus & come to class every day, but then suddenly, at the last minute, it's both all my fault because they don't have the points to get an "A" and they "want to know what they can do."  I'll tell you what you can do-- go back in time to the beginning of the semester and be an "A" student.  Grumble grumble, grouse grouse.    So Andrew is still out of town and I am doing okay-ish about it.  Sometimes it's not a big deal at all-- I'm busy, and just go through the day without having to worry about feeling sad or anything.  But then, for a few minutes, I just get to missing him and of course, as soon as you try to control that feeling, it gets all balloon-y and you're crying like a doofus.  That doesn't happen often, but weirdly enough, after seeing him this weekend and having a great time, it did.  Almost as though when I  don't  see him I feel better about it.  But that's happened before-- back when he was in the Navy full time when he'd go away it would be easier if he was just gone, and then came back.  It was harder when it was a few days or even weeks at a time.    So the "kids" are starting to trickle in to the lab now.  Maybe I'll need to pay attention-- but they are on their own for lab work for most of the class period.  I do need to give them their final and stuff.  So more later.

      Note to J:  better?  See?  I'm blogging away like a bloggin' fool.  But just not in any sort of intelligent and insightful way.    EWWWW the cat just pooted.  The words to Phoebe from Freinds' song:  Smelly cat, smelly cat, what are they feeding you?   Smelly cat, smelly cat, it's not your fault.     And Kim's addition:  but boy do you stink.  EW.  Get off my lap.    Hey, it makes as much sense as the Phoebe version.  Who, by the way, is also an INFP.  Hee.

      I wrote some good "pomes" today. (Yes, spelled wrongly on purpose).  This one I like:  boasting, green, orange-throated lizard-- bold on the wooden fence. doesn't see the mockingbird. who sees him.     There's more I wrote, but they are on this sheet of paper in my carry on airplane luggage, and I would need to go grab it and drag it in here.  Again, with the whole previously mentioned "lame ass" ness, I'm trying to avoid writing here.  But I am really not all that interested in the Italian Job again.  (as also previously mentioned.)  But the cat says mew.  And demands three days worth of pets.  Is mew cat for "hey lame ass"?    OOOOOH and guess what?  FINALLY after years of waiting, the new Steven King Dark Tower book is OUT OUT OUT and guess who owns it already? Mmmm hmmmm. And it was 30% off.  So you know what I'll be doing later (after The Eye-tal-ian Job is over.  Piffle.  Don't wanna wait.  ::pouts::)  Reminds self to be grateful that self has good friends who take self out to dinner and buy self birthday presents.  And cards.  And make the restaraunt waiters sing birthday songs and bring balloons.    Self really needs to stop talking about self in third person.    Self is annoyingly hiccuping.  Self goes back to Marky Mark's marky goodness.

      I'm feeling dreadfully inferior because I am not as witty and smart and frickin' funny as the following blog:  urlLink http://outofcharacter.blogspot.com/  that JEANNINE so kindly pointed out to me.  Phhhffft.  I don't have a dissertation to write, so I will just read this person's blog from now on.  Surely I can find a tenure-track job doing this.  God knows there are profs with WORSE specialties out there.  (thinks of a few.  gets annoyed.  resolves to find cooler specialty than annoying woman who I am thinking of).  And way hotter than.  :p   Okay, and my friends are in the other room watching the Italian Job (mmmmm marky marky goodness ::drool::) which I saw this very morning on Andrew's Shreveport couch.  And they very nicely sweetly and other adverb-ly came over to offer me human companionship so the cat did not murder me in my sleep after me being gone for three days and I'm in here being a lame-ass on the computer.    I'm sure there's some sort of obsessive compulsive disorder involved.  But really, I didn't want to see Italian Job again so soon.  I guess I shouldn't have asked them to come over, then, huh?  :)  EDIT: Just re-reading this and I realized I wrote it badly.  The annoying woman is NOT the blogger that I mention.  It is a professor at a university I once knew.... so that is cleared up.  And I don't think that analyzing blogs would actually be a bad specialty.  It would be sort of cool, but probably more a sociology sort of thing.  (dated December 16, 2003)

      Jeannine was saying that I should get rid of my blog cause I haven't written in it in a while.  Well, nah, I think I'll keep it, cause now and then I still feel like posting something here.  I'm working today on downloading photos from the digital camera for my Boston/Niagara Falls trip, and then the Halloween party the other day.  The digital camera is a bit picky on how it likes to do it, and I've tried a couple of times to do it all at once and it keeps crashing the browser.  So now I'm doing it something like five photos at a time.  Which is a pain in the neck, but working.  I've got most of the trip dowloaded and edited now, and I'm going to post the relevant ones to the domestic goddess website, then the rest to a private page for friends & family.  :)  Ah technology is wonderful.  What I think one problem with it is that it sucks the life out of the batteries to do this and the camera turns itself off, so then the computer freaks out.  Pffffhhhhttt!! I have to get more batteries now! But since I have to go to the gym soon, it's okay, I'll stop and pick some up.  With Andrew gone, I do have a lot more free time that usually I fill up lying about with him.  I do miss my sweet baboo an awful lot-- I'm going to see him this weekend for my birthday.  Once the fall semester is over, I will fill up much of this time with my dissertation writing, but I just don't think I can do it now since I have so much other stuff, I do need some downtime.

        Things I Sometimes Forget      Lying in sand so white it looks like snow, while the sun beats down in waves on my back, heart throbbing into the hollow just beneath my stomach, a grittly cool hole that cradles me.  Smelling the coconuty tinge of someone else's oil.  Feeling regret that it will not last forever as you look out at the water which is impossibly greenblue and just the warmness of cool bathwater and salty on your skin.  Eyelashes wet with drops of water, framing the white crashing surf .    A hammock in the shade, dappled green, and a small black cat wanting to lie on your stomach.  Birds circling on wind-currents above-- endlessly looping in their quest.  One green lizard breathing and bobbing on the dry wooden decking, tasting a white flower briefly before moving away so fast you doubt he was really there.    The quiet humming of an air conditioner while you lie on the softest cream-colored sheets you've ever seen, in a small hotel room in London, while around you a city out of history swirls busily with tourists and workers and bustling cars.  You and him alone, napping, and the feeling of endlessness that will end.      The smell of a horse who loves being brushed, as the sun goes down-- earth and dirt and sweat and grass and musk.      Standing at an airport to wait for a man I am in love with but not yet admitting to love, watching the crowd of blurry faces for him, not seeing him, not seeing him, then, suddenly, he is there but going in the wrong direction.  Chasing quietly after him, not really wanting to yell out his name in case you're wrong, but giggling slightly at the silliness of desperately chasing someone who is looking for you.      That winter, even one which someone else would think of as mild but still keeps my toes never quite warm or dry enough, will ever end.

        Ew ew and horribly horribly ew!    I just read about the  urlLink Swiss artist  who uses real dead animals in her artwork--cats & bunnies and stuff--on one of the  urlLink blogs I read .  It's horribly disturbing.  The pictures are not at all pretty, I don't think.  The gallery on which the pictures appear says "Most people who see Nathalia's pictures for the first time are impressed by how beautiful they are."   I don't think they are beautiful at all.  It's bad, obscure, stupid art, in my opinion.  I guess everyone has a right to their opinion, but still.    There's something that looks like a tear in the eye of the bunny that was on Mock Turtle.  So I think about this.... is the problem I have with it that the animals she's used "so far" are domesticated pet-types?  What is the difference between killing an animal for art and putting its head on a pedestal of some sort, and having a big, juicy hamburger?  Is there a real difference, or is it only degrees of difference?  What happens to cow heads that become McDonald's product?    I mean, I like meat.  I really wish and have done so many times that I could make myself commit to becoming vegetarian... I understand it's my choice, and that it's totally selfish of me to not make it.  But that doesn't mean I don't generally realize how horrible and hypocritical it is of me to claim to care that a bunny or cat is killed for art's sake but not mind because a less-cute animal dies for my lunch.  It's a very problematic conundrum-- one I'm not sure how to settle.  But I do have to say that there seems to be some degree of worse evil if the animal is merely being used to create art.  It's a lot like the deer on a wall-hanger "art" that one finds in Texas a lot (hunters, you know).  But at the very least, I can say that the meat was used and not just tossed away (most hunters consume their stuff.)    Anyway.  I feel this entry spinning out into a place I didn't really want it to go.  This is a disturbing kind of art.  I get it that art is supposed to make us uncomfortable-- but I don't think it's supposed to have other helpless victims too.  As Andrew very concisely put it, "it's the pointlessness of it that's disturbing."  The woman could use digital manipulation to do what she does.  That's part of the upsetting nature... it's like the " urlLink rabbit died" pregnancy  tests of the past.  As soon as they could do it otherwise, they did.  So why keep killing innocent animals just to take pictures of them?  Especially if your message is so obscure that the only political thing we get from it is the animal rights one?

       Weather Pixie Just Doesn't Understand    The cute weather pixie on my blog is intriguing.  It's currently 49degrees F in San Antonio, according to my "Weather bug" program.  The program "weather pixie," designed by a person in, I think, England, has her wearing a crop tank top and low rider pants, standing outside.  Really, in Texas, when the temp goes below 60ish F, Texans pull out heavy duty anoraks and parkas like they were starring in the Martin Scorsese version of   urlLink To Build a Fire  .    We don't handle cold well.  She should be bundled up.  Perhaps 49 degrees F is warmish, spring-like weather to folks above the  urlLink Mason-Dixon line .  But it's frickin' cold here.  Put on a sweater, for god's sake.

       Wherein We Discover That Chocolatinis are Spawn of the Devil and Should Never Ever Be Consumed Again     I think I won the Trivial Pursuit game.  I can't actually remember the final question, but we were tired of the unending-ness and boosted the end up.  But still, I just think there should never be that much vodka in the house.  One bonus is that for some strange reason, having a hangover reminded me that I still hadn't paid my tuition for Spring 04.  So instead of lying in bed worrying about it, I just paid it.  Now I'm going back to bed.  With my credit card properly stowed and yet another semester of graduate school assured.  Weeee.

       Leaf Blowers Make Great Household Cleaners    Yes.  That is a  urlLink picture of my husband , cleaning the living room with a leaf blower.  He's done it before-- I just never had the digital up and ready for him.  See, we have hardwood floors & a black cat.  And lots of black furry balls get in corners where the damn  urlLink swiffer  and/or broom takes FOREVER.  So, when we're about to have some sort of party (as in Christmas eve festivities which I will NOT give you details about, cause it's just too damn icky; trust me on this you don't wanna know)  he sometimes whips out the YARD TOOLS and blows the little catfur tumbleweeds right out into the back yard.  I really don't mind.  He believes I don't mind because the  urlLink Spark.com  thinks I'm a man... and that most women would freak out if they came home and found their own little version of  urlLink Tim Taylor  leaf blowing the living room.  Hey.  I think the corners look nice all shiny & clean and do not mind as long as he doesn't break anything.  Is that so wrong?

       Poor Velma?    Did you ever wonder if Velma got tired of being the smart girl, and just wanted to get lasik, or at least contact lenses?  Or, if she really liked hiding behind her big, black, unattractive eyeglass frames while Daphne snagged all the cute guys?  Because we all know what happens after the cute guys leave Daphne for some other girl and Daphne, Velma, Shaggy & Scooby have a long all-nighter with Haagen-Daz and brownies, talking about how they actually thought they might have seen Daphne's ex on  America's Most Wanted .      You know.  To make her feel better about him dumping her for that waitress at Dairy Queen.   Maybe Velma secretly was a sexpot.  I mean, you know what happens in the videos when the librarian in ugly glasses whips the glasses off, flops her hair around,  Charlie's Angel's   style, and goes after the cute young guy who's been in the library writing his Master's Thesis on, say,  urlLink Slime Molds .  Maybe Velma earned her way through college as a stripper at a tasteful "gentlemen's club".  Or, perhaps she was a brainy college student by day, porn queen by night.    But, let me tell you.  At night, after Velma took off her glasses, even after having to squint around desperately looking for those glasses after putting them down, cause she can't see to find the stupid things without them, and then settled down next to a good, thick book and a glass of Merlot, after a long day nabbing cleverly costumed criminals and having Fred take the credit for it all AGAIN, well.  Let's just say Shaggy wasn't the only one who understood the value of a Peanut Butter and Jelly pizza topped with Scooby Snacks.  But that still doesn't mean she wasn't a smoldering sexpot.  Behind those dark frames may have lurked a woman who was undressing you with her eyes.  I mean, how else did she know all those "ghosts" were really Mr. Jenkins from the real estate office?  She knew, cause she had memorized every inch of his ruggedly handsome face and strong, gently calloused hands.

       Today's Activities   Number One:  Breakfast-- eat that yummy banana bread you made yesterday.  Two: Start Cooking for Christmas Eve Family Event..... make Texas style beans, chili, tamales.  Do not spend all day baking.  HEB makes fine cookies.  Especially that pecan tart with shortbread (wow) crust.  Three:  stress over nothing.  Screw the holidays if they can't take a joke!    I've noticed in a couple of blogs a sense of frustration and anxiety over the holidays.  I'm sure part of that comes from working in retail-- it's the absolute worst time of the year to have to earn your living in the mall or any other place where frantic, glazed-eyed zombies search for an elusive "perfect gift".  Me, I just have to ignore students who didn't bother with their grade all semester but after it's totally too late to do anything about it, want to "meet with me."  Yeah, man.  I'll meet with you.  I hear that there's a cold front moving into Hell right now.  Just wait till it's there, and I'll arrange a quick little meeting for me to "justify" you lame-o grade to you.  But heck, that is easy!  I just have to happily delete emails I'm not required to answer and ignore any phone messages.  I remember when the first George Bush was out of office, and some reporters were clamoring for some kind of comment on something, and he said "I don't have to answer you people anymore."  That's how I feel.    So anyway, I got distracted.  What I really wanted to discuss was Christmas. This year, I'm fairly okay with it.  Yes, I felt cranky and scrooge-like when it started being "Christmas" at retail outlets shortly before frickin' Halloween.  And I don't like yard decorations.  And I have yet to try the gingerbread or eggnog lattes at Starbucks cause I don't want to be jonesin' for them the rest of the year when they're not available.  But all in all, I'm sort of looking forward to various aspects of the holiday season.  Andrew & I had a good time in Florida with the relatives there-- photos will be forthcoming eventually.  Some cool beach time was spent.  We traipsed around this very cool condo that's going up on the end of Pensacola beach pretending it was at all possible we were going to buy the million (yes, that's right) dollar penthouse condo.  Yes, it did have a really fabulous view.  It was cool!  But altogether, the condo felt a little "retirement village"ish.  Even if there was a snowball's chance we could afford a million dollar condo.  (With three smallish bedrooms).  Today, I'm hosting the Christmas eve traditional San Antonio tamale feast.  And tomorrow, we'll drive out to the lake house to spend some time with extended family there.  There are even (gasp) possibly board games in the future.  If I could get everyone to wear the same sweater (preferably red, with a flashing reindeer nose on it) I might have to try.  It's all part of my evil plan to be happy instead of miserable, and so far, it's actually working.  The whole "no-gifts-for-anyone-other-than-people-you-actually-know-something-about-buying-gifts-for" plan has worked admirably thus far.    Christmas doesn't have to be the commercial suck fest it often is.  It can be a time to hang out and eat good food, and hang out with those family members you don't want to throttle after ten minutes in the room.  But you do have to work at it.

       I Hate To Ruin a Good Ending But  I think the Corey Hart entry would've been a good way to end the year.  Really.  But now I'm back in old San Antonio, after a trip to Florida and a photo essay to follow soonish, and I thought I might as well ruin a good ending by adding a few things.  So.  Tonight-- a bottle of Perrier Jouet champagne, yummy steaks & sweet potatoes, and a movie.   urlLink  Holes  .  Pretty good.  I recommend it highly.

       Corey Hart Rocks The House Old School  So the last pre-Christmas craziness is done (other than the cross-country trek to spend two days with family who may not all be there-- and by that I don't only mean "not all there crazy"). I finished my shopping and my "personal assistant to Andrew's dad" shopping. I got the tree up with a nice little "timer" to turn the lights on. I decorated the fireplace and the rest of the house. We are officially a Christmas-zone. Not a crazy Griswoldian zone though. Target wasn't even that bad. But just for those faithful readers out there to be up on this, I won't be blogging again till after Christmas, since tomorrow starts the eternal family quest round of visits. Off to Florida. Then back here the 23rd for family stuff, till just after the first of the year. Anyway. Doesn't leave much room for thoughts to share with total strangers about my private life. :) While I'm gone, amuse yourself with the  urlLink Online Etch-a-sketch , courtesy of the movie Elf. (Which I haven't seen. Probably a video pick). So a good one to end your year with.   On the way to Target, I heard Corey Hart on the radio, singing "Sunglasses at Night." I thought, "whatever happened to good old Corey?" I had such a crush on him-- with his Elvis-like little crooked sneer-smile and his croony flipped hair and cute little fonzi-esque leather jacket. So dreamy. So now I've answered my own question by googling the man.  urlLink http://www.coreyhart.com/ . Apparently Corey is a dad; will have a new baby in, like, a month. Four kids. Figures such a cute boy would have lots of cute kids. You can listen to a new version of the song on this site, and the main page is sort of "bloggish." Funny.   I have to say I like the old version much, much more. There was something sort of "bad-boy who would break your heart and leave you with a collection of cheap silver jewelry, declaring his love for you while he dated your sister" creepy about that slow guitar riff in the background. The new one is a bit too DJ'd sounding, like something the tuxedo-clad DJ at  urlLink Seville Quarter  used to mix up for us back in the 90s. But boy, that song brought back memories of high school and crushes and cruising down  urlLink pristine white-sand Florida beaches  wearing your sister's coolest bikini, with a wine cooler in one hand and your best girlfriends next to you and a guy named Howard (who we called "the duck") scamming on you..... you know what I'm talking about. Awwwww yeah. Except for Howard, (who was old enough to be my, well, older uncle) it was allllll good.

       where the @#$%**!!  did I put the Christmas lights?   Okay.  I think I threw them away during the re-packing stage last year.  I remember they were hopelessly tangled and I decided that this year would be a good time to get new ones.  So now I have to head off to Target.  And maybe TJ Maxx.   Cause GOD KNOWS I didn't spend enough money on three complete seasons of  Buffy the Vampire Slayer    yesterday on DVD.     Hey.  It's for my dissertation, dammit!  There's no investment like an education!  (The DVDs.  Not the Christmas lights).    If you happen to see a woman laughing quietly but maniacally as she strolls around Target's Christmas decor section today, offer her a free latte at Starbuck's or something.  Make it one of those peppermint ones.  Cause she'll probably really really need one.

      Okay.  I'm worried.    It occured to me as I was brushing my teeth that my hair looks an awful lot like it did when I was about 13.  Back then, the "long straight unstyled" look was NOT cool.  I mean, this was the era of lots o hairspray and big big curly stuff.   urlLink Heather Locklear  TJ Hooker  hair .    Nowadays, it's cool to have long, sleek, unstyled hair (right?). (Although it's still not cool to say nowadays).  But is it wrong to notice that you resemble yourself from, oh, more years than I care to relate?    Or am I just making a  urlLink mountain out of a mole-hill  again?

      More news from the Christmas party....  I hate it when you get so drunk that people have to, for weeks, tell you the embarassing things you did at a party  cause you just don't frickin' remember !  Apparently, in between pestering the guy who looked like my dead college professor  urlLink Omar , and the other guy who I told, apparently many many many times that he looked like "a cute urlLink  Prince Charles " I did many other embarassing things.  Including an incident which left one friend commenting that I have very strong thigh muscles.    Why, oh muse of alcohol, do you make me so silly?  Why can't I be disturbingly poetic and write stunning verse that people, for generations, will say "Oh, yes.  That was a writer." why??  Instead, I hug guys who look like former dead teachers and tell them they need more "bling bling."   Must be the Irish genes.

And I've got:  0 out of 3 invited guests.  Sad face.    On another note:  when you accidentally spill water from the fridge water dispenser down your pants and it looks a little bit like you wet yourself, a good thing to do is go change pants before those late friends get here.  I'm going to do so now.  :)

      And now for a "medical things about Kim you really didn't want to know" update:  my achilles tendon area hurts.  Oweee.  Does this mean I'm vulnerable to arrow shot there?  Oh, also, if you were reading the "boob watch" earlier, my cousin K pointed out that I hadn't mentioned it in a while.  They're fine, thanks.  It's my contraceptive method, I believe.  Too many hormones.  But I'll be fine with a little chocolate.  And time.  And a fair freaking universe where women don't have to turn into the incredible hulk every single month.

Quit....no.....  I warned you.     And before you ask me why I did it:  It was a poetic experiment.  But I do say the word suck an awful lot in this blog.  Hmmm.

       Don't know the reason; I stayed here all season... but there's booze in the blender, and soon it'll render, that frozen concoction that helps me hang on....   The semester is officially O-V-E-R!!  I turned in my grade sheets today with only a few minor feelings of guilt and glee over handing out mostly Bs and As and a couple of Cs.  And a couple of Fs, but only people who never ever ever came to class.  What in the world happens to some students who pay their money, then never come, but never drop either?  Oh.  I know.  They show up two years later asking for me to change their grade (duh!  happened this year.  yup).  There's a blog here about it somewhere.   It is both pizza and margarita night.  Usually it's just the first, cause dude, it's like, Monday.  But not today!  Today is officiall FRI-Ha-Ha-HI-IIIIDAY!

      So we caught the bogeyman-- well, at least  urlLink Saddam Hussein .  I guess it will be a great day for politicos to either announce great victory or claim defeat (perhaps because it took so long) and/or point out that Ben Laden is still out there.  I saw a photo that I guess was supposed to be him-- with a very shaggy beard, looking pathetic and a little freaked out (they were looking in his mouth-- I guess to check his dental records?) It's a fascinating turn of events.  Does this mean some (at least) of the resistance we've encountered in Iraq will fade?  Or get worse?  Can the US declare great victory and pull out now, thus ending what is turning into a bit of a nightmare scenario but saving face?  I know that there has never been a real link to Hussein and the 9/11 attack.  But I do know that a man who had  urlLink hundreds of children  in prison for refusing to serve in the military deserved to be taken out of power.  I just am not sure we should be the police of the world.    I read somewhere that the supposedly Chinese curse "May you live in interesting times" is not actually a Chinese curse, but originates somewhere else-- probably some PR person like the supposed  urlLink Chief Seattle  speech.  But wherever the interesting times curse comes from, it certainly does work.  I think non-interesting times are generally much better for a majority of people.

       But Do You Recall, the Most ::insert synonym for sad here:: Reindeer of All?   I have to admit that I don't really get into Christmas yard decorations.  I put up my little Christmas tree, and a few decorations around the house.  Not a whole lot, though.  I do like the blinking lights of the tree, and I like the way it looks sort of "homey" when I drive up and can see the twinkling blue, red, green and white lights in the front room "garden window."  But I live in a suburban neighborhood where, for years, I have watched an obsession grow.   This obsession, you ask?  Yard reindeer.  Some houses have white wire sculpted reindeer with little white lights around the wire scupture.  I've noticed a number of them this year with little twinkly blue lights in front of them, like they were grazing on little blue flowers.  They look kinda cute at night, but in the day, against a backdrop of slightly green to brown dead grass & live oak trees, it just doesn't say "holly jolly Christmas" to me.  Today I drove past a house that had two reindeer strung on its roof-- I think they were supposed to evoke Santa having just landed, but really, they looked like victims of an unfortunate incident, left behind because Santa has a schedule to keep, dammit!    Down the street is a house with plywood reindeer, very flat, with "insert slot a into tab b" stylings.  They have a fairly large number of them-- but they are  always   getting blown over by the wind.  So they are in various states of lying flat on their sides with little plywood white hooves flailing about in the air.    People.  Please.  Reindeer are  urlLink majestic, beautiful creatures  when found in knee deep snow.  But in a slightly brown/yellow yard "deep in the heart of Texas," reduced to wire and plywood, and flopped over on their sides like a fish out of water?  Well.  It's just sad.

Okay, on this comment system-- it's new, and I JUST signed up for it a little bit ago, and it doesn't seem to be working quite perfectly yet.  Give it a couple of days (at least one) before worrying too much about it.  Hopefully it'll all be fine soon.  I even paid for this system, and it seems to work FINE on other blogs I've visited.  So we'll be patient and see.

I had to explain this in case when I pull open my sock drawer in a sec, I am buried under an avalanche of un-matched socks.  In all of my drawers, there is this huge pile of crap I never wear, don't remember buying, and that doesn't match.  And honestly, it really really seems like there is more every day.

      Does it take anyone else but me FOREVER for my blog to load?  I am wondering if it's something in the template coding, but am not sure what to remove and/or edit to fix it.  But maybe it's just my computer?    Okay. I took the style sheet/skin that was making the blog load SOOOOO SLOWWWWWLY out.  But I did basically keep the style that the blog was in, cause I liked that look.  It's not as cool, but I don't want the blog to take a year 1/2 to load!  Maybe if I find another version of the style sheet that doesn't have whatever was wrong with that one, then it'll be otay.  Also, comments do not seem to work.  Comment This may be down right now, but I'll try to put them back.  It's not like people were making very many of them-- not like the 100s you see on some other sites.    Holy Hand Grenade Batman!  I just realized how long I've been working on this issue!  I need to get ready soon and go to the gym and other stuff.  And the cat is yelling at me too.

       Why Ex-Cute Guys Become Creepy This morning I was thinking about, for some reason, guys I once dated. (I won't call them boyfriends cause they don't really deserve that title).  Not in a "miss them" sort of way, but in a "wow I'm glad that is an EX" sort of way.  Partly in relation to a good friend who keeps dating the same evil woman (not really, it just turns out they are all part of the same pod-group-collective of evil women).  Because the last one he dated thought the nice things he was doing for her were truly sinister-- that he was manipulating her by being kind and caring.  (Wow. She needs therapy.)  And I told him, yes, that sometimes something you might do that feels really really romantic if you're "the one,"  if done by the  "wrong guy"   can end up being  really creepy .     For example (you knew one was coming, right?):  I dated this guy that looked a little bit like  urlLink Dave Navarro  from  urlLink Jane's Addiction  for a very short couple of weeks.  He seemed pretty fun at first, and exactly like the kind of "won't take anything too seriously" guy I needed at the moment. You know, the one you can date a few times and move on to another guy without really breaking anyone's heart cause he wouldn't get too hooked on you right away cause he's a party guy?  After a few dates, I found out that the "casual" drugs he said when we first met that he had used (not used then, but told me about then) were anything BUT the minor ones I had no problem with.  He actually had a really serious problem that resulted in jail time.  So as I was trying to carefully ease my way out of a relationship (carefully cause he creeped me out so much I thought that if it wasn't careful, he might go crazy & do really really crazy things) with said crazyguy who I worked with, taking his jacket I had borrowed back to his house, he painted "I heart Kim" on his wall with a spraycan of red paint.  The creepy part?  The heart was pierced with a needle.  I kid you not.    So the painting on the wall  might   be sort of romantic, given a cool wonderful guy who I wasn't at that very moment dumping because of a drug problem.  But the needle thing just pushed it so over the "I will talk about this in therapy someday" edge.  Don'tchathink?    And right this second, I am freaking out cause my mom will read this blog and go-- "I knew I didn't like that guy."    Well me neither.  That's why I married the other one.  The non-creepy one.

       65 MILLION Girls Denied Education   Can you believe  urlLink these findings  by the UN?  Basically, the story says that part of the problem is fees-- when a poor family has to pay to send children to school, they are more likely to pay for the sons to go and not the daughters.  Sometimes, here in the US in academic circles where everyone is privileged enough to be able to go to school, I think we forget that there really are still people out there who are systematically discriminated against.  It's not a case of a perceived unfairness; it is truly a systemic ban on women learning.    And then the funny(?) part:  when I first posted this entry, I forgot to run spell-check and had spelled two easy words wrong.  I really suck.!

       Two groups of people that make me go "hmmmm."    Group One:     Okay, so today, I was roaming about like a Christmas zombie, trying to think of what to buy not only for the people on my list but for my father-in-law who always ropes me into doing his Christmas shopping for him.  I went to lunch with said father-in-law at Luby's, a cafeteria style place we have here in Texas.  It's not bad food-- not fabulous, but not bad.  They've gone recently to an "all you can eat buffet" concept-- sort of-- it's still where you go through the cafeteria style line and the servers give you your plate of stuff, but you can get anything and everything you want.  I got a little ground sirloin patty, some corn and some squash.  I was totally full on my three tiny little things. Most people, though, got three or four "meat" items, PLUS three or four veggie items (including fattening things like mac & cheese and mashed potatoes loaded with gravy).  Those trays places like that have, large ones, were totally full.  It was really disgusting.  I guess I didn't notice it as much before I went on my fitness kick, but it AMAZES me how much food people think is appropriate to eat in one sitting.  The amount of food people were having FOR LUNCH on a regular workday is enough to feed me at least for say, three meals.  Maybe more.  And I'm not saying this in a "see how conservative I am at eating" but in a "see here, folks, is why you can't lose that weight" and why Atkins diet is so frickin' popular.  Never eat more than you can carry yourself!   Group Two:   At the mall, I passed by one of those knife stores.  I peeked in, and there were some very elaborate, fancy daggers (what do people use those for? You don't cut your steak with them... but theoretically, there's not much call for stabbing and throat slitting in modern society).  There were about ten people milling about in the store, including:  a person who looked like the stereotypical teen computer nerd-- complete with a few bright spots of acne.  A young-ish couple-- he "typical redneck guy" and her "bleached blond" still-carrying-around-the-baby-weight.  And an older hippy type who looked a bit like Jerry Garcia.  In other words-- your basic, normal, typical folks.  I don't get it.  Is there really much call in today's society for a ceremonial 12 inch jewel encrusted dagger?  Maybe they need knives like that to fight off the competition for all that food at the buffet.     Just a couple of observations. I don't have any firm pronouncements on either group-- I just don't know what it is about them that makes me feel like commenting.  What do these small microcosms have to say about the world in which we live?

      Grrr.  Here's an annoying thing from student slacker (who had an annoying habit of surfing the Internet while I was lecturing-- and probably thinks I was too stupid to notice).  On his last document, he got a grade based partly on the fact that his last project wasn't quite the way I asked it to be from class discussion-- something I talked about in class lecture, and gave multiple samples of, dozens of times, and virtually every other student did properly.    He comes up to me and says "his sister was a tech writing major" and she was the one who took out all the personal stuff-- which is why he got a B.  Well too frickin' bad dude.  Just because your sister did fine in tech writing, doesn't mean that she has any idea what  I   was looking for!  She would understand the concept of audience-- and me as audience told you to do it one way. You're the one who was in my class, and should have heard my discussions of what to include.  I don't care that she is a tech writer for company XYZ.  This is not, exactly, a tech writing course.  It's technical communication, and the grade standards are BY ME.  If you have a problem with your grade, take it up with your sister, dude, not me.  She gave you bad advice.  And then, as I'm explaining this, he gets all huffy and says "I was just talking to you about it, asking for more explanation" like I'm being mean to him.  And said "I'm not challenging the grade or anything." Yes you are man.  Bringing up the "my sister is a tech writer" says "she's more of an expert than you are."  Tough toenails.  Tough toenails. Tough toenails.  (Repetition deliberately added for emphasis).    Here is a tip from me to you, if you're a student.  Don't get all up in your teacher's face about grades.  Consider exactly what you want to say before you do ask questions.  If you think your teacher is really unfair, then that is one thing, but if you just have some lame-ass excuse for why you didn't work very hard, and somehow think the teacher is too stupid to see what kind of work you put into a document, (and therefore deserved the grade it got) then suck it up.  You know what you really really deserved.  Never ever ever ask your teacher to justify your grade to you.  This is directly confrontational, and a way of you trying to weenie your way out of the grade you deserve.  If you want to point out an error in the numerical grading, or point out a thing the teacher missed, or ask a question like "how could I have made this better," then that is fine. But standing there with your paper in your hand and saying essentially "I think your grading sucks and you're wrong about what I deserved" doesn't get you anything.  I know people will think I'm being a jerk about it.  But the deal is this.  There are certain things that a teacher does to come by your grade.  If you have a certain grade, chances are really good that there are many reasons for it.  Especially in a writing course where there's not a 1::1 correalation between points deducted and your score.  It's not completely quantitative; sometimes it's a quality judgement.  Maybe that seems unfair, but again, DUDE,   who ever told you life was fair ?

       Morning has broken.... la ti da da ti da daaaaaaaa..... On the " urlLink "Which  Finding Nemo   character are you " " quiz, it says I'm Dory, the blue fish played by Ellen.  Hmm.  I tend to agree.  It would be funny to repeat myself several times here to re-emphasize my similarity with the little fishy blue, but I'll save you from that.    I am very sleepy, and my head still hurts.  Who knew dancing was so dangerous?  I think it's slightly possible I might have even given myself a mild concussion from that dancing escapade.  I wonder what Jeffrey's face looks like.  I know he bonked his face on the bar too.  At the time it was funny.  Now it really really is not.   Today's the last day other than final exams that students will be bargaining and negotiating for better grades.  (I hope.  I may not answer my cell phone for a while).  I feel kind and elf-like about the ones whose grade dipped unreasonably because of stupid mistakes and not really malicous naughty student behavior and they  may  get extra kindness on the final grading.  They're lucky I'm not in "Buffy Vamp Face" mode.

      Boy does my head hurt.  Last night was Nissa & Aaron's big Christmas party, and at some point, Jeffrey & I were being silly & dancing.  He "dipped" me, and banged my head on A&N's bar.  It was funny at the time, but right now, I have a giant sore goose egg on the back of my skull.  Can you say "stupid dancing stupid stupid?"  Cause I would, but it would hurt my head too much.    I watched  Down With Love   tonight.  Eh.  It was so-so.  I remember when it first came out there was all this talk about it, and it sounded sort of cute.  I think it was kind of over-rated.  I've been fairly disappointed with my movie watching choices lately.  The other night I watched  Charlie's Angel's 2 , which I don't recommend at all to anyone.  Anyone.  It was really bad.  I remember around the time IT came out there was all this complaining about how Demi Moore spoiled things because right around the time the movie came out the public heard about her & Ashton Kutcher (I'm not sure that's spelled right, but I really don't care.... it's close enough).  I am pretty certain now that were it not for Demi's boy-toy action with a man young enough to be her son, far fewer people would have gone to the movie.  Piffle.

       Hell Freezes Over:  Kim Becomes Exercise Freak    This just in from our Hell office, record low temperatures have been noticed in the outer rings of Hell because Kim has signed up to become an aerobics instructor.  She will take several workshops in early 2004 which will allow her to instruct people on how to aerobicize.  Spokespeople from Kim's office said that it will not be her only profession; just a sideline that keeps her busy while she also finishes her doctoral work.  Those who remember Kim saying at times in the past how much she hated working out were stunned at the news.  "She used to always say the only reason we would ever see her running was if someone was chasing her or if the ice cream truck was in the neighborhood" said one interviewee.      Yes, it's true.   I have officially signed up on the  urlLink afaa  website to become a certified aerobics instructor.  The classes are in January and early February.  I'm waiting for my "study guides" to come in the mail.  I'm fairly sure I can handle the content. (insert sarcastic look here).  But it's cool.  I was telling Andrew that I can handle two things from the 1. fitness 2. dissertation 3. teaching thing at once.  So since I'm not teaching, I can handle the other two.  This semester has seen me fall off a bit from the aerobics thing, as well, and I think it's more important at this point to keep healthy and write than teach students how to write a thesis statement (something others can do for me while I'm busy.)  You just wait till I'm all buff.  (Buff-er). (Buff-est).

       Temporarily Single Girl's Guide to Dining Out Alone   Here's a tip on what to do if you decide,  cause you're a liberated woman dammit, and can go out to a nice restaurant alone if you want , to treat yourself, and you find yourself seated next to a self-centered young woman and her remarkably tolerant male companion.  As she chatters incessantly about her relationships with men other than her companion (who must be a masochist of some sort, and who, amazingly, still pays for the entire meal without even an offer from her to chip in), thirty minutes of "so then I'm like... and he's like... and then she goes.... whatever"-- you, who still must insist on enjoying your glass of Chianti, and Italian herbal soup and blue cheese salad with walnuts, you must not appear to eavesdrop on their inane and tedious and largely one-sided conversation as fodder to place later in  your blog.  Do not appear in the least bit interested.  Heaven forbid your ears turn slightly towards the table as you write down the horrible conversation on your paper tablecloth.  You must not let on that you want, desperately, and at a loss for the blog entry and future writing of evil dining-conversations you once heard, for said couple to either leave or spontaneously-self-combust.  That, my gentle reader, would be unsociable, spinster-aunt-like thinking.    Instead, order that cappucino (which will come with a lovely froth and two entire biscottis just for you).  Revel in the taped Sinatra-singing "whiskers on kittens" after they leave, yes.  But do not throw your leftover crusty bread surreptiously at them in order to encourage said leaving any earlier.  Also, don't watch the obviously gay but terrifyingly unfashionable couple in the booth across from you.  They  are   cute, yes, and having a much more interesting conversation, but you mustn't stare at  either   couple.  They will notice you, a single (but not at all lonely) diner, if you do.    And remember to leave a fabulously generous tip.  You did just make the day of the tired waitress who commented to a fellow waiter that she hadn't eaten since breakfast at 6 am (dear reader, it's now 3:00, poor waitress) by boosting the hell out of her add-on sales at the end of the day.  But your over 20% tip will make her day's end even better and you can then go home and grade student papers with a good feeling in your heart, like the Grinch when he  finally   understood.    You.  Rock.  On.  My.  Friend.

        Follow your intuition?    One more thing before I go off and pretend to actually have a life today...  Does anyone but me find it supremely satisfyingly irritating that Jewel, who pretends to be being all ironic in her video for "Intuition" by commenting on how celebrities "sell themselves" but that if they just "follow their heart" they'll be all okay and stuff, but then, there's the little intuition razor, which uses Jewel's song, and seems to have come out with the little intuitionsong campaign before Jewel released her song? (Boy that is a long sentence.  Just read it twice).  It seems like maybe she wrote this song about selling out (making fun of it) while she was, in turn, selling out?  I mean, I get it.  You were homeless in your quest to become a big famous rock (not really) star.  And you're a deep poet.  Yeah. Sure.  Why do I like the honest celebrities who don't apologize for selling out much better?  Or don't try to pretend that being a sell out is not their actual JOB.  (That's the point, entertainers-- selling stuff.  Didn't you read the contract old Beelzebub asked you to sign?)    Okay.  Now I feel better.

      I woke up this morning with the cat poking me in the face to realize that I actually have almost no obligations as far as anyone but me today.  Yay!  I plan to grade the manuals tomorrow, and the other papers I will get early next week.  But for today, I can go work on things of MINE without feeling guilty that I really ought to be doing something else.  This is nice.  Now if I can just figure out what I want to say about the witch books, exactly.

       Happy Happy Joy Joy Yes!  As of now, all I have left to do for the semester is grade essays/final exams and turn in grades!  WOOOOO!  It's been a long stretch these last few weeks.  I like a lot of my students a lot, but the semester itself has sucked!  Now I can  1. clean this messy house 2. get started on thinkin' about and writin' about my witches more 3. relax & work out on a regular schedule 4 eat chocolate  Okay.  I could have done (and have done) step four already.  But I thought it made the list seem better.  More important.  Chocolatey.     Tangent Time On the way home from work, I was behind this pickup truck that must park under a tree.  In its truck bed were lots of leaves.  They would randomly fly out and pelt my wind-shield.  Now, after the first pelting of the foliage menace, you would think it wouldn't freak me out again.  But no.  Every. single. time. the leaves flew out, it startled the heck out of me.  Woke my inner reptilian brain which said "run scream danger danger".  And when that reptilian brain o' mine gets going, I get a reptilian brain-ache.  Right there at the base of my skull, where that little lizardbrain resides.  Like a brainfreeze, only worse, cause you also get this unpleasant adrenaline rush, which makes your skin hurt after it's gone.  Curse your leafy-danger truck!  Normally, leaves scurrying about on the ground is a pleasant thing in my life, seeing as how autumn is officially my FAVORITE season.  But no.  These were dangerous leaves.  Leaves that cause panic.

      I may be getting a complex. No one ever ever replies when I email them or comment in their blogs.  If anyone ever commented on mine, and when people write to me about  urlLink womenwriters , I always write back (unless they're asking for something really really annoying-- like me to do major amounts of research for them cause they're too lazy to go to the library).  But nice notes, yeah, I always write back, almost immediately!    So, me feels very sad.  Like the last kid picked for the blogger team.     "Uh, yeah, you take the kid who can't type cause she's got no thumbs to hit the space bar with, and, darn, that leaves Kim.  Yeah.  Allright.  We'll take her.  ::heavy sigh:: but we get to pick first next time!"     Also, women writers is DOWN right now.  Pisses me off, that.  They better friggin fix it soon.  Man.  I. Mean. It.  GRR!  But on the good news side-- this last day of classes is HALF OVER!!! Party party!  I'm thinking about margaritas.  :)

       I'm a nervous wreck.    I hate winter. (Such as it is here in Texas, where it's something like 70ish today--except in buildings where they still have the air conditioner on, and there it's in the low 50s).    Yes I do.  I keep getting tiny little electric shocks when I touch things.  Does this happen to other people, or am I just extra specially electrically charged?  The worst thing is that it's mostly random.  Sometimes I don't get a shock, so those times when I'm touching something, I'm never sure if it will happen or not.  Isn't that the definition of torture?    And now, happy people, because of that EVIL EVIL class next door, I have the song "Greased Lightning" fully stuck in my head.

      I am in the computer lab, and all semester, the class that meets next door has been odd.  Today, they are yelling/grunting very loudly.  I wonder what content that course is covering?  I mean, some courses get a little loud & excited sometimes, but this is a little weird.  Is it wrestling?  Or what?  Okay, just now there was a very very loud bang.  Like, um, a loud inappropriate banging noise.  Not "explosives" like, but still a bit creepy.  Whatthahell?  On another note: yay!  Today is the last day of "real" class!  Monday is just a "turn in your final exam" day.  It was going to be evals day, but I am not passing them out this semester.  I haven't decided yet if I feel up to baking cookies for four classes of students for Monday.  I'll think about it. I did promise them, and all, but man, I am out of steam!  Also, I just had a student from 2001, who stopped coming but never dropped the class, come by and ask me to change his grade from an "F" to a "W."  Hmm.  I feel all suspicious, but then I also just don't care. ::insert apathy here:: I'll ask department Secretary "K" how that works. (Cool. That sort of makes her sound like a  Men in Black  character.) If it's allowed and all.  He said he had spoken to her about it, but I dunno.  I never heard it before.

      Here's something you'll undoubtedly find friggin fascinating:  Every last blog I have read (and believe me, man, I've been DOING SOME RESEARCH in my insane attempts to avoid being a responsible adult) that talks about their Thanksgiving experience basically had a negative one.  Of some sort.  Granted, no one killed anyone else (that they've admitted) other than a few poor turkeys.  Turduckens.  (I like that word).  No one stuffed a ::insert name of cool toy of the year here:: into another frantic mother's throat at a crazed Malwart shopping frenzy.  But Thanksgiving seems, upon completely unreliable and anecdotal samples of the dozens of people who wrote blogs about it, to be the worst holiday ever.  Mine, actually, was sort of nice.  Does that make me a freak?

      Okay, so I was productive today.  Worked for a while on the proposal-- I think it is ALMOST perfect.  I'll send it off to Dr. R tomorrow.  I also worked a bit on the Practical Magic chapter, although I'm still having a hard time thinking of what I want to say about it, actually.  Deep thoughts are not yet forthcoming.    My cold sore is throbbing.  Why oh why did I have to get these evil things?  I am pretty sure it came from a kiss on New Years' 2000.  Bleah bleah bleah.    Back to the Gaiman board.

      Today I plan to go to Starbuck's and do some work on the dissertation proposal, and maybe do something with  Practical Magic .  I need to write the paper for the conference, although I'm still not exactly sure what I want to say.  But the magic of coffee will, I have no doubt, help.  I think the dissertation fairies really like coffee shops-- they hang out there and sprinkle little tiny bits of help on my head when I order a latte.    But first, I AM going to the gym.  (fanfare).    Every time I look at my new "blogskin" I am happy.  It's really spiffy.  Yay May! (the designer).  She rocks!  I think some of what the style sheet does I could eventually figure out on my own, but I don't mind letting someone else use their cleverness to make me look good.  :)

      I've just found this cool "Skin" for my blog.  I like it!  I'm updating it a tiny bit so the chick looks like a red head (that isn't quite right, the hair-- I'm going to make it look less blotchy later).  And my favorite color garnet red is in there too.  But it's very spiffy, done by a  urlLink young woman  who does this for fun (?) I guess? I also need to add links to the link area, and other stuff.  But hey, it's much more creative & original looking than the one I had before.  So it's staying.  I like the pin up thing and the martini thing.  As anyone who knows me will realize.  Fun fun fun!  I will put the comment thing back in.  Oh.  I guess I probably lost all my comments with the code.... ah well.  Most of them were from me anyway.  Self-commenting.  Pfffhtt!  I am going out.  Out out.  OUt.  OuT.  Silly typo.

      I am less grumpy now.  I think part of why I've been that way lately around teaching time is I get hungry during the morning, and if I haven't eaten a proper breakfast, man, just stay the hell away from me!     I'm going shopping!  La la la!   I'm looking for something to wear to Nissa's Christmas bash.  At the outlet mall.  Fun and excitement in a convenient single-serving disposable package.

      okay, so.  I have this student-- the one who wrote the "porn" essay earlier this semester. Every time there is something that he could remotely "challenge" me on, he does, and very aggressively.  Maybe it's because of the porn thing, maybe it's no longer easy for me to be completely objective because that particular incident made me very uncomfortable with him.  But man, I think he doesn't like it that I am a female in charge of his success.  I think he has major issues with authority figures that are women.  I mean, he could have issues with all authority, but somehow, I doubt that he's writing challenging email to his male professors.  So I get one today, and I am a bit mad.  I've tried to be nice about this attitude he has before, and in person, he's pretty nice.  I think it's possible he just doesn't realize how badly he comes off in email.  So I told him.  It's important to know this, don't you think-- that you come across as a totally agressive jerk in email?  I mean, I've been told that before and thus modified my behavior when appropriate.    Did I mention that I am going to be really, really glad when this semester is over?

      Forget Bennifer, forget Demi & Ashton, forget any other couple out there.  Carmen & Dave are my new guilty secret.

      Okay, it's truly starting to creep me out how many people get to my blog by putting in search phrases that would normally land them on a vile & disturbing p@rn page.  I really don't want to put the phrases in this blog entry because it'll end up sending more of the hapless pervs here.  While I appreciate and applaud the right for anyone to want to look at consensual adults doing things they wanna do, (no kids or animals, please! and consenting is an important word) I DON'T want to 1. look at it myself 2. have it pop up on google every time I put what I think is an innocuous search term into the thing.  I put the "counter" on the page cause I wanted to see how many people were visiting, where they came from.  I saw wonderful "google fiction" on  urlLink estella's  blog, and thought, wow, I wonder what people will get to my blog with?    Granted, they don't appear to spend much time on my site-- there are no nasty videos here, thank you very much.  Aside from some search phrases that make me laugh--  "weight watchers stuff" and "luby's" and a really weird one about "TJ Maxx," and "Flannery O'Connor and a stoat" (what were they looking for?!)-- there are people trolling about for p@rn who think a website with a title "kim procrastinates" is a likely place to shop.  It's really begun to make me very self-conscious about the words I use.  Google is a "whole word" index-- it lists every word on your website and people with very loose search strings will see a match when there isn't one.  But what words will get the deviants here?  I shudder to think.  The funny thing about it is that I can put phrases like "Little Women" into google and get p@rn.  I don't understand why they're having so much trouble finding it that they have to search the ninth hit on the list.  It's really easy.  Just put the word P@RN into your search engine and you'll find it, dudes & dudettes!!  (And I'm really wishing I hadn't written the word p@rn so many times here, and am thinking about adding a subterfuge to get it out of google.)   Look at the definition of procrastinate, please.  It's not PROCREATE.   Go elsewhere for your jollies, thank you.

      I'm going out of town early tomorrow morning, to the land of the computerless.  (My family isn't exactly computer-ish and unless I find a cybercafe, well, it's hopeless).  So I'll be back Sunday (hopefully AM).  Maybe I'll have interesting things to say based on my aerobics workshop and/or flights.  We'll see.  Surely something in Mississippi will be blogworthy.  The odds are with us.    In the meantime, try these healthy diversions:   urlLink Boarding Bunny   urlLink senses test   this one's kinda hard!  test your senses.  Although I totally disagree with them about the pineapple question.  urlLink Java Pac Man!  Take a  urlLink meaningless test  you can brag about.  I like the gender one cause it says I'm a man, baby. It's not  urlLink addicting , it's  addictive   urlLink Go to the Library   While you're wasting time, why doesn't someone go feed my cat?   You know who you are.  :)   UPDATE   Oops.  Have you SEEN the weather?  Apparently, it is a terrible weekend for me to fly to Mississippi cause I go "standby" and it's just NOT GONNA HAPPEN.  Which is actually quite a good thing cause on the way in to check the flight availabilities, I discovered-- drum roll please--  A LEAK IN MY PLUMBING!!!!! there is water in the floor (formica is ruined) and it's a fun filled day with a man with butt-crack tomorrow (aka the plumber).  The water is currently off, which sucks when I want to wash my hands.  Sigh.  HEAVY sigh. I'm glad I took a shower after my workout.    So thankfully AFAA offers "credit" for missed classes.  I must to the batcave to see how that works so I don't lose my money.  Damnfire and hellnation.

      When I began this blog entry, it was to joke about how bad I am at math.  On the GRE, years ago, even after intensive studying, I managed to score a 13% on the math section.  That means that fully 93% of the population did better than me.  (Yes.  I know the math is wrong there.  It's a joke.)  This is the same exam on which I scored in the 90% on verbal and somewhere in the 60's on logic.  I took an IQ test sponsored by the  urlLink BBC  a month or so ago and did  embarrassingly  bad on it-- primarily because of the two math sections on which I freaked out and, under the anxiety of doing word problems (I know, they are easy for apparently everyone else in the world but me) I did stupid things like accidentally answer two questions at once, and generally just panic.  I totally must have missed something like all of the math related questions, because I felt I was doing okay on the other sections of the test.  According to that IQ test, I should have never made it past 6th grade.  So then what the hell am I struggling with my dissertation for?  I should be happily finger painting or something.  (Sounds good to me!)   I have generally made okay grades in math courses-- given time, and a calm environment, I understand theory of math quite well.  Better, in fact, than my husband did when he tried to help me with the problems I was working during my college Algebra course.  Long ago when I was studying math all the time and took the ACT to get into college, I scored an above average score for the math section (I don't remember the actual numbers.  See.  Numbers are bad).  So, when it's something that I don't get anxious about, I can do math just as well as the next person.     But  it really does seem weird that someone who is as advanced in education and pretty smart about a lot of other things can just be as bad at math testing as I am.  Supposedly, the average grad student has an IQ of about 120.  My BBC IQ "test" put me WAAAAAAY under that.  But I did fine in grad school, aside from the normal lame freakouts that everyone has now and then, and a few "issues" with tests/essays/bosses.  I made all A's with the exception of one independent study where my professor thought my paper was "eh."  So-- one paper "eh."  Surely that puts me above average, huh?  I mean, I am apparently really, really bad at certain math scenarios.  Clearly, my math problem must not be my fault.  There has to be some sort of psychological disorder-- maybe a drug I could take to fix my math phobia.  Well.  In planning this blog, I looked up " urlLink MDD " and found an entry for it.  I found a similar one  urlLink here  (these authors are remarkably similar-- perhaps they plagiarism a bit?  hmmm?  Is that better than my math problems I ask you?)  The first website says:  "It is possible that some people have problems in math because of their genetic makeup. In contrast to some families whose members have great difficulty solving math problems, there are other families who tend to have members that consistently have a very high-level of math functioning."     "See"  she said defiantly.  "My genetics have cursed me to do badly in math.  I'm not, contrary to what the IQ test said, just smarter than Forrest Gump.  I have a mental sensitivity, dammit.  Me and  urlLink Barbie  understand that math is hard.  I demand that you refigure your tests to not be biased against me.  I deserve a good IQ score, too.  I want to be able to lord over everyone how well I do on standardized tests!  I want to be asked to join groups like  urlLink MENSA  and scorn them because they don't know the word means "stupid" in Spanish." (Yeah, sure.  They're being ironic.)      It's just not fair for me to suck at things like that.  I want someone to design an IQ test that appreciates my special form of genius.  So. You psychologist types.  Get busy.  Write me a test that proves I am the genius I am.  I'm going to go fingerpaint till you get it done.

      The three banditas were lovely beyond words.  Known only as La Vampira, Senora Rica, and Manda la Hermosa, they rode into San Antonio one Sunday we will never forget.  La Vampira was a dark, exotic beauty with luscious red lips-- rumor has it she cannot live during the day without her magic golden "ear bobs," given to her by a famous Transylvanian Prince on their wedding night.  She rides ceaselessly to avenge his brutal slaying at the hands of  the deadly Jesuit vampire hunter, El Perskio.  She believes if she avenges her Prince's death, his spirit will rise to take perfect human form again, and their love will last forever.  Senorita Rica, with her blond curls and sparkling blue eyes, loves the taste of tequila and will shoot you on sight if you break her rule of talking business "after five."  She only has eyes for her lover, the dashing Senor Broculi from New Mexico, but her sharp temper is legendary-- and she might just crack that bullwhip if you step out of line.  Manda la Hermosa is the group's business-leader--she may not have a head for math, but she can add up the gold the trio has stolen from the banks of every unfair jefe malvado west of the Mississippi with no trouble.    The word on the street had it that it was Manda's idea to visit fair San Antonio on the springlike day in January.  With its clear blue sky and warm temperatures, it was no wonder the three former saloon girls turned bandita would seek to have some refreshing lemonade at the new saloon run by the recent Irish immigrant, Mr. Pat O'Brian, after shopping for new blankets for their faithful horses, and some face creams from the local curanderas.  Just outside the Alamo, they had a brush with a lawman who failed to recognize them; dazzled as he was by their beauty, all he said was "ladies."  I saw them myself as they posed for newfangled pictures, holding their weapons of choice and displaying some of their cash.  The rumor that they cheat at cards is surely an unfounded lie spread by detractors jealous of their beauty.  They ride shoeless in honor of the legendary Amazons, who are said to have fought their many enemies while barefooted.    It was truly a shame that just after  urlLink they took these lovely photos , the sheriff of our fair River City came and trapped them in a horse corral.   For forty minutes they fought to escape, mingling in a small stampede of various other riders drawn out by lovely weather.  La Vampira bolted first-- escaping into a yellow buggy as she vowed to see her partners in crime later.  The other two hid out for a while somewhere on the river before throwing the sheriff off their trail and escaping on Rica's gold-toned horse, named Saturn, after the Roman god of war.  They rode out, singing "Yellow Rose of Texas" and dreaming of the day when their independent spirit and beauty would no longer label them outlaws.  Surely no one would claim the $25,000 dollars in gold coin which is the reward for their capture-- but it would be a lucky man indeed who spotted them and lived to tell the tale.

      I use "quotes" around my title cause I'm really feeling a little critical of this ad campaign and article about " urlLink coaching boys to not abuse women ."  Yes, one definitely must start when people are children to keep violence out of the home.  The article implies that "kids are exposed to violence outside the home" that will make them violent.  I say, hooey!  In my experience (and unfortunately, in my childhood I had a lot of this kind of experience) the best way to keep someone from being an abuser is to not abuse them.  Abusers are not usually outsiders-- they are usually insiders-- it doesn't happen in some random strange place, it happens in your own living room.   The only way to stop it?  To not have a man in the house who abuses his wife/the child's mom.  To not have a mom hurt you.   Most abusers learn it from their parents .  Do you really think that the people who are out there hurting their kids and spouses are going to read this lovely little internet article and think "wow, yes, that's certainly the answer.  I've seen the error of my ways?"  If you do, you're a lot more optimistic than I am about this.  I do realize that MAYBE coaches, and teachers, and outsiders can possibly have some minor influence on a kid if they follow the advice in here.  But I think it'll be minimal.    I think their heart is in the right place.  People (and I don't just say men here cause I don't think men are the only culprits in a very violent culture) need to learn to be kind to each other, to not be violent.  But I think these little suggestions are basically using a thimble to bail the ocean.  The violent culture in which we live, where TV execs take out scenes of "sexual content" (which is a normal and good part of human life) and leave in "violence" of a level that makes me nauseous, needs significant changes.  And I'm cynically afraid that it'll take a shift in human nature-- and that, my friends, will take a frickin' miracle.    Okay.  Today's entry is cynical to the extreme-- I'll write a more positive one tomorrow, wherein I talk about our "tourist in your own home town" day.  With pictures.  :)

      Yesterday, at the Forum shopping center, there was this (presumably) security guard driving around in a golf cart, wearing a red-bandana over his face "bandit" style.  His long, wavy black hair whipped out behind him as he cruised around the lot.  I saw him several times, each time wearing the bandana.  Ah, the freedom of the open parking lot with your trusty golf cart beneath you. YEEEEE HAAAAH!  What the heck is the point?  It was not particularly cold yesterday, nor dusty.  Nor have there been any major reports of SARS or Mad Parking Lot walker disease in the San Antonio area (that I know of).  I kept thinking we should "circle the wagons" cause  los banditos   were coming.     Randomly Connecting Tangent in 3, 2, 1.......  When I was first in college, I heard a letter written by  urlLink Flannery O'Connor  to a friend of hers where she described a bizarre incident that happened in her home town where the local "clan" dressed up in their robes, drove around in convertible cars, which were decorated with Christmas lights, giving out baskets to the poor.  She said something like "I don't make this stuff up."  Seeing El Bandito Del Parking Lot made me think of that letter.  Maybe it was a gesture of solidarity to Michael Jackson or something.  Who the heck knows.   Alls I know is -- it was kinda weird.    But what is weirder is this mask I found searching for a picture to describe the above event for you, visually.  Check  urlLink this  out.    Do you think the model puts that photo in his portfolio of "jobs" in order to go out and get more?  All I kept thinking was  urlLink Zed's Dead, Baby.  Zed's Dead.

      Tituba (my kitty) is at the vet preparing to get her dental surgery today.  She had a cranky night cause I couldn't feed her after 8 last night, and then I had to drag her out in the car and put her in an uncomfortable metal cage at the vet's.  Then, while I was filling out the paperwork, she let out this heartbroken meowl.  I feel terrible; I know the dental scaling is good for her, and it should help the tummy aches and stuff.  But I still feel like a big, bawling, nervous baby.  I know that the "risks" associated with anesthesia are low, but I still am freaked out by the fact that there are any risks at all.  I know now why I put it off last year when the vet recommended she get this procedure.  Cause I'm scared something will happen to her.  I actually am more worried right now about her than I was about myself back a few years ago when I had to have anesthesia.  ::sigh::      Yes.  That would be bad.  Now, I'm going to be a big doofus all day till she's okay.  So if you have any good kitty karma to spare, think happy thoughts about my little black kitten and say a "blessing" to  urlLink Bast  for her.     UPDATE:   I just heard from the vet and Tituba is "in recovery" waking up and apparently fine.  Her teeth are all clean and she didn't have to have a tooth removed after all.  BUT there still is the question of the upset tummies, and why.  So we have to keep an eye for a little longer, since she has just recently gotten a new kind of food; that could be it.  It could be some liver issues (cause she keeps hittin' the sauce-- I tell her, "no more than ten Margaritas, Tituba," but does she listen?)   So, I'm feeling a little better.  Still anxious about what's wrong.  I know it's totally lame to talk about your pet too much in a blog, but I promise to post something cool and non-kitty related tomorrow.  :)

       urlLink Eshu -Elegbara is the African figure of creativity, guardian of the crossroads, and part of the " urlLink signifying monkey " of African folkloric tradition.  Considering this is the first day of the  urlLink Chinese New Year , singified by monkeys, I'm feeling very good-omen-ish.  Since I've been studying voodoo as part of the dissertation work on   urlLink Brown Girl in the Ring  , I know he's also one of the voodoo loa who help the initiate participate in religious ceremonies.  I put a  urlLink veve  to Eshu on my laptop the other day, to try to help beg for some help in the dissertation inspiration department.  Today, I wrote four or five pages of the best work I've done in a long time, as intro to Chapter three, which will be the chapter that features Brown Girl in it.  I'm very excited.  Maybe, instead of invoking the dissertation fairies, I've been talking to the wrong cultural mythological tradition.  If so, then so be it-- I'll get out the cigars and rum and candy and promise more to the loa if they just help me unleash the creativity of scholarship that I need before I can get on with my life.  Really, now that I think of it, guardian of the crossroads is exactly the spirit to invoke for a dissertation-- which is a sort of crossroad between "student" life and "professor" life-- a key to the Ivory Tower.  So, thank you Eshu.  Keep my tongue signifying, please please!  There's a huge bag full of chocolate candies and some Pina Coladas in it for you.

       And it's a good thing!   So I'm at Borders, browsing in the "metaphysics witchcraft magic" section looking for useful books for my dissertation work, particularly annoyed that the alphabet seems a bit "off" in this section and I can't find the author I want, and I hear two teenaged girls giggling and whispering in the book row behind me.  I keep hearing the noises that truly mean that they are being secretive and weird-- those "unforgettable from the teen years" spider sense feelings that I am the butt of a joke.  I'm thinking they're making fun of me cause here I am in the witch section, browsing through books like  urlLink Hex in the City  and  urlLink Voodoo in Haiti .  I'm debating whether or not to turn around and give them an "evil eye"-- heck, since I'm in the witch section, they OUGHT to fear me, right?    Then, after they leave and I have made my final selections (including a cool book called The Pagan's Muse, with " urlLink pagan prayers " and poems) I glance at the row the girls were uncontrollably giggling in.    Oh.  The label on the row reads "Erotica" ::blush::  No wonder they were all teen-ager-y. Clearly, it wasn't  my  butt they were concerned with (well maybe, but probably not).   :)  Still, it's sad/funny that I felt a bit paranoid in the witch section.  I happily recognize that the world of witches is NOT what many people think it is-- witches  aren't  Satanists-- in fact, most witches, being pagan, don't even believe in Satan at all (you have to be Christian to be a Satanist, in a way-- he is the devil of the Christian pantheon, after all).  And I don't live anymore in the heart of the Bible belt where some fundamentalist fellow might yell at me through a bullhorn cause I'm at an Irish Pub having dinner.  But it's really a bit disconcerting to browse that row and see the looks on people's faces as you go by.  If you don't believe me, try it sometime.  Oh, not if you live somewhere like NYC.  But anyplace that's a little "small" that might have obnoxious teens.   Just make sure the magic row is not right next to the Erotica one before you get your hackles up.    Of course, I'd rather be the one browsing the witchcraft stacks than the young man and woman who were snuggled up very cozily with her on his lap being all "Jack and Diane" on a chair in the middle of the "Religion and Spirituality" section who looked at ME funny.  I guess you can get yourself dropped off by your parents at the book store and the clueless parent figures there's no place for canoodling.  (There was a plague of teens there this afternoon apparently).  They're the ones who should have been in the Erotica section.  Maybe next time I'll point that out to them.

      I hate to do so many entries on my cat lately, but she is my current main companion.  And so.  The in case you didn't know:            it does no damn good to yell at a     cat because they are driving you crazy while you're trying to     work. They just meow at you and claw your chair.      Also.   urlLink Women Writers , my "online academic feminist geek fest" is new. There's tons of book reviews.  Soon there will be new poetry & fiction.  And MAYBE some scholarly articles, although I'm not sure.  So.  If you want to know what you ought to read, check it out.  While I go pummel the cat.

      It is a widely held belief that Joseph Pilates invented Pilates, a stretching and toning techinique, in the early 20th century.  In reality, he ripped off the exercise from his cat, Pickles.  Cats have been doing "pilates" for hundreds of thousands of years.    During some Pilates moves, cats will often meow loudly and run under your body while you try to do the rapid motions of "rolling like a ball."   Do not be confused or upset-- the meowing is actually encouragement as the kitty says, "get your fat butt moving-- it's about time you started working out."  Kitty yoga, of which all cats are natural masters, is very similar to Pilates and cats instinctively understand what you are doing; their apparent distress is actually an attempt to push you to your peak Pilates and/or Yoga technique.    Your yoga/pilates master cat's darting under your body is not designed to throw off your workout, as kitties understand that good workouts actually push you into physical "overload" and you boost your metabolism by adding complex motions like the advanced move titled "avoiding-crushing-10-pounds-of-cat-under-the-rapidly descending body"  (it's actually very hard to translate into English; you should hear the name in felineglais).  As you attempt to avoid squishing the kitty under your rapidly rolling body, remember that bleeding from multiple kitty scratch wounds burns calories-- so if you come a little "too close" for the kitty's comfort, they might swat you.  This swat is to be taken as a compliment.   An added bonus to kitty Pilates is that by properly positioning kitty, you can pet them while doing your "hundreds."  However, be sure to keep your powerhouse engaged while removing kitty from your tummy, where she will have settled during your brief rest period between sets.  Again, this is not an attempt to distract you but to remind you to keep your abs flat and comfortable for kitty rest.  The longer you can stay with kitty on abs and abs engaged, the better your physical conditioning.  Kitty Pilates and Kitty Yoga are advanced, very spiritual practices which I'm sure you will come to love as much as I have.  My kitty yoga master, Tituba, (which means well-stretched-one in felineglais) leaves you with a calming "namaste" as she enjoys her catnip tea and contemplates the Nirvana of the couch.

      Watched  Friends .  Played on the computer while that horrible Donald Trump show was on (soooooo borrrrring.  the worst reality show ever!)  Then, sat on couch to watch  Will & Grace  & drank Sleepytime tea.   urlLink This  is what it looked like.  Those books are the ones I'm using right now for dissertation work.  This is officially "my view from the couch."   The piles of papers?  Photos I took for the dissertation.   See how busy I am?    Digital cameras are fun.    Hey, give me a break.  My husband has been out of town for months and will be out till May and my cat pukes in the middle of the night.  I am allowed to be annoyingly blog-camera-irrelevant fact-y.

      If you do a search of images of witches on certain internet graphics websites, you find a really fascinating juxtaposition of scary evil witch images from, say, the 1500s (around the time our modern concept of the witch develops) and  urlLink Sabrina, the Teenage Witch  looking cute and perky at various functions.  Oh, and various "witch doctors" from third world countries in full costume.  And, inexplicably:   urlLink Vladimir Putin .  ??  One of the things that is most fascinating to me is that in old woodcuts of witch trials, almost ALWAYS the witches are female and the entire crowd of people surrounding/executing them is male.  And if there are women, they are there either as other witches or horrified onlookers.  Women don't appear, in most of the art, to be enjoying the spectacle the way the men are.

      when you talk to a friend you haven't spoken to in a while, but who regularly reads your blog, all your "new" stories are "old" to them.  Things to do today: 1.  get "sample" dissertation bound so I can read it.  Gaze longingly at it and wish it were mine.   Think  about putting white out on the name and seeing if the committee will fall for that trick.   2.  nap-- the cat puking kept me up for three hours.  But I did read dissertation work during that time, so it counts as work.  Can it count as work today, or is it yesterday if it was still dark out?  3.  Exercise.   I bailed on exercise Tuesday, so need to workout today or else both weekend days will be workout days.  Because of the rainy wet weather, I begin to feel the urge to bail today, too. 3.a.  Have you ever noticed how long it takes for the microwave to cook for 8 minutes when you're starving?  You go in there, and there's still 4 minutes, after what seems like HOURS of waiting.  Lean Cusine Vegetable Eggroll, HURRY UP!! 4.  stop blogging. 5.  but there was this interesting article on NPR yesterday, on the  urlLink Diane Rehm Show    about writer's block (which I don't have, but a little bit of dissertation anxiety) and hypergraphia.  I thought the woman (Alice Weaver Flaherty) on the show had been spying on me.  Maybe she is.  Maybe secretly I'm being recorded RIGHT NOW.  In that case, I better take a shower.  Go to the NPR link and listen to the article on "The Midnight Disease."  Totally.  She's watching me now.

      That sounds like a cool grrrrrl band, doesn't it?  If you have a grrrrrl band, you're welcome to use it.  But in reality, it's a sad (mostly true) story.  My cat  urlLink Tituba , who is my baby, my angel, is having a "digestive issue."  I first noticed it when she lost a bunch of weight in December.  She'd always been a cat that people said "boy, that cat is fat"-- insulting her and making her very sad as she read through Cosmopolikitty.  She would ask me if her collar made her butt look fat and push her salad away before finishing it, ordering it always without dressing of course.  So I was happy at first, thinking the "weight control" cat food had finally done its trick getting her down to a normal, not-fat kitty weight.  Slim, trim, doing kitty yoga and all.    But lately, she's been puking up all the "dry food" at approximately 3 am.  Then, after begging for more "moist food," she eats for a few minutes, then runs to the litterbox where she has, er,  other issues .     Other than the puking, and litter box issues, she's fine-- seems pretty much normal.  Happy and playing and all that.  But I'm definitely worried about that binge-purge stuff.  I'm taking her to the vet at 10:30 today, to see if there's something we can do.  She's 10 years old, which in cat years is an old lady.  I can't help but wonder if her exposure to the  urlLink Victoria's Secret  models and all those mean (dare I say, catty?) comments from people over the years is affecting her as she tries for supermodel thinness.  Maybe she needs some therapy.  And  urlLink twinkies .  I wonder if she can keep those down.    UPDATE: Well, we're back from a harrowing experience.  Poor kitty had to be poked with needles a BUNCH cause she needs blood work to make sure she can "go under" next week.  Why?  She has a bad tooth, and needs the rest of the teeth scraped for tartar.  Basically, that, and the stress from Andrew being gone, is probably what is causing her puking and smelly poop.  Because of the sore tooth, she doesn't want to eat the dry food, and the moist food is stinkier.  So, mostly, everything is okay.    Except for the "you better watch your back" looks she's giving me now after her visit to the V-E-T.   So if I don't post again for a long, long time, and you hear something bad has happened to me, tell the police it was the cat.  She's definitely got it out for me now.  I hope she doesn't hire a "hit snake" like she did on that mouse problem we had a while back.

         As Long as You Get it in by April 15   Yesterday, I was driving along and there was this young woman in a  urlLink Statue Of Liberty Costume  standing in the parking lot of a fairly empty former-grocery-store strip mall (since the store relocated, it's a bit Mad-Max-ish).  She was waving a sign about coming in to do your taxes at the tax-refund store in the strip mall.  Waving her little "faux" torch and holding her little "do your taxes" sign.    She was a study in fabulous contradictions.  Oh, Lady Liberty, ah, since when are you a tax-whore?    LIBERTY:  "Give me your tired, your poor, your starving masses yearning to breathe free"---- "and bring your W2 forms and your I-9s while you're at it.  Don't forget photo ID cause if you want to file this baby electronically and get all your deductions, I'm gonna need that ID on file."   A much, much better mascot, metaphorically speaking, would have been  urlLink Uncle Sam .  Or even some tea.  (wait for it; it's revolutionary war humor)

      I've been faking it.  I saw other blogs with titles and have been making them up with a "heading" html script.  I just realized, after joining a blog group called  urlLink blogsisters , that the button on the "settings" section about a title field allows me to automatically insert a title.  With no fake HTML on my part.  Finally.  A title feature that can really satisfy my urge to label.  So, now, I am a sistah, and capable of inserting witty monikers for all my entries.  If I could just get my frickin' archives to work, I'd be all good.    Now, for my nightly date with  urlLink Sleepytime  tea.

       Reading The Third Wave    So third wave feminism is important to me, to my dissertation, and I've been trying to figure out what it is so that I can write about it in said dissertation.  Basically, the idea is that there have been three distinct "waves" of feminism.  The first wave is considered to be early feminists-- a big long historical group starting roughly with women like  urlLink Mary Wollstonecraft  and moving into the 1900s with  urlLink suffragettes  and  urlLink suffragists  (yes, there is a difference.)   urlLink Second wave feminists  are the ones we are most familiar with-- women and yes, men, of the 1960s to the present who fought for equal pay rights, equality in the workplace, an end to domestic violence as a "to the moon Alice" joke, sexual freedoms, such as birth control rights, and increased representation of women in ALL walks of life.  These second wavers are still actively engaged in feminism-- many of them are my mentors.  Third wave, then, is defined as women and men who have come to feminist thinking with it always there-- those of us born since, say, 1964ish.  But what, you say, beyond this rather simplistic concept of "waves" is the third wave of feminism?    We correspond roughly with Gen-X (although we don't often like to admit that.)  A while back, on my other website, we did a collaborative review of a book that helps define third wave feminism better than I can do in a brief blog entry.  urlLink Check it out . Also check out a couple of websites with some good definitions and arguments:   urlLink here   and  urlLink here .  Third wavers have been called post-feminist, and disparaged as creating division within feminism where  urlLink there should be none .  Second Wavers have said that third wavers are selfish, that  urlLink we feel a sense of entitlement .  "Well, geez" says I.  "Wasn't us being entitled to freedoms and choice part of what you fought for?"  The Onion wrote a bit a while back titled " urlLink Women Now Empowered By Everything a Woman Does ."  They mean it as a joke-- a way of poking fun at the way feminism has been co-opted by things such as the  urlLink Luna  bar and  urlLink cereal .      But the thing is-- the Onion is partially right!  Women today can be and are feminists without having to march on Washington in big groups waving signs.  It's not just about big political movements; it's also about being free to choose to not think about it!  The freedom for women to just live their lives today IS a feminist act-- because of feminists, women can choose to live their lives without being forced into things they don't want to do, or given no voice.  Even the choice to NOT be a feminist can be seen as a feminist act. You are allowed to not think about it, to stay home and be conservative, and still enjoy certain freedoms as a woman that women of the past, women of other countries, do not have.  Think about the women being beaten with a stick by the  urlLink Taliban  for going out in public without a man to accompany them, and women who have to ask for political asylum to avoid having parts of their  urlLink sexual organs cut off , and you will realize that ALL women in the US and other "first world" countries have a lot to thank feminism for.    Just in the daily clothing choices we make, and our choices of whether or not to be stay at home moms or high-powered attorneys, of whether to teach our toddler sign language or dress them in pink and blue, we can define ourselves as feminists.  Like to wear short, short leather skirts and spike heels?   Like to wear  urlLink PANTS ?  Like to cut your hair?  Like to use a  urlLink condom  to prevent pregnancy and/or disease?  Like to READ?  You have a feminist to thank for that.     urlLink As a blog I recently discovered  put it, feminism doesn't exist-- feminismS do.  There is no monolithic theory upon which we all agree.  I can't define it very well right here.  I'll have to do some work and really write a clear, coherent description of feminism, including third wave sorts of it.  But that, of course, would mean I'd be working on my dissertation.  So.  For now, know that third wave feminism is a fact and will be around for a while.  That doesn't mean we're trying to destroy those who have come before us-- nor that we don't realize we, too, will eventually be last year's news.

       I need to get out more.     Yes, today, on the way back from the 11:00 hot aerobic workout, I found myself laughing and talking to myself because of a sign at the plant nursery down the street.  It said "Fruit and Pecan Tree are here."  So I was debating-- was it one pecan and one fruit tree?  Or a tree that is a miraculous new mix of fruit AND pecan?  As I was talking to myself, I realized that this is not exactly normal behavior.  I think I need to get out of the house for a while and actually talk to other people.  Maybe the cat doesn't count.  So today is officially "errand running day."  There are eyebrows that need waxing and checks that need depositing.  And maybe a trip to  urlLink Red Robin .  mmmmm  Red Robin.  :: urlLink gurgle like Homer Simpson .::

       Electronic Databases Rock!    I spent today downloading a ton of articles that I had been "meaning to get" ever since one of my committee members mentioned them, ages ago.  I just hadn't made it to the library to get them.  But, today, I figured out that the ones I really needed are available through some online databases that I can get access to through the library on campus.  Score!  So I have a TON, an absolute TON of reading material that would make people on planes wrinkle their foreheads when they said "what are you reading" and I showed them.  They would say "What's the point of reading "Anti Essentialism in Practice:  Carol Gilligan and Feminist Philosophy"?  And I would smile wisely and say "ah, it's work stuff."    I worked hard today and now am on my way to the gym, and then later I will watch  Friends  and eat some rotisserie chicken & salad & veggies.  I feel very virtuous, so don't get too close, cause my halo might poke you in the eye.

       January (not  urlLink April ) is the Cruelest Month   For most Americans, it's not  urlLink Lent  that is the time for  urlLink penitence  and virtuous redemption, it is the first few weeks of January.  We try to quit things: smoking, eating too much, drinking, cursing.  We go to the gym, that  urlLink Foucauldian        urlLink Panopticon  whose mirrored walls mercilessly show every bulge, every flaw, that was gained over the months of "holidays" from Thanksgiving to New Year's Eve.  The machines in the gym are medieval torture devices of which deSade would approve-- they bend us, move us like hamsters on a wheel spinning every so often upside down.  We vow to get that project we've been neglecting done at last.  To spend more time with our loved ones.  We say "while in our cars, we won't speed anymore; we won't flip people off and cut them off in traffic; we will drive like mature adults."  We'll save money, pay down that credit card debt.    If you're in a "public place," now, or the next time you find yourself in some line at the coffee shop, look around the room-- chances are good that a few of the people who you see are suffering from secret aches and muscle pains-- too much weight lifting or step aerobic-ing.  They're craving a cookie, or a cigarette, or a damned drink of wine.  Their cravings cannot be expressed well because they've given up cursing, #%&@!!.  They are neck-deep in guilt over something they've been putting off for so long it's almost an insurmountable task.  They're trying to juggle their schedule to include new yoga classes, or weight watchers, or that second job to save more money.  They have made  resolutions , dammit, and they're going to do it  this  year!  So.  In the light of this national season of purging and fasting and stubborn attempts to mold ourselves into the people we want to be, I vote you who are reading this today be kind to someone.  Smile at them.  Don't sabotage their diets by bringing in  urlLink Krispy Kremes .  Don't disparage that project they've been writing for years and have yet to get done.  Don't ask them when they're going to settle down, find the right woman/man, have kids.    Instead, offer them help with some difficult task-- open the door, say thank you, give those of them you know well enough to do this for a massage.  They might not notice it, might not even say thank you in return, but you will be doing something kind and small and local and helpful to your own cosmic karma.    Me, I'm too busy writing my dissertation and entering the food I eat into my online diet journal and going to the gym and studying to be an aerobics instructor.  It's definitely up to you guys to keep the season of resolve going.  I resolve to get back to work on my real job.

       Dissertation Work is Cool    Today I worked (for enough hours to now have a sore back) on the dissertation.  I worked on analyzing the movie version of  Practical Magic , * got some screen shots for the essay which I will eventually have to redo with a DVD version (they come out much clearer & cleaner than the video screen shots).  I also wrote a bit in the chapter, which will turn into a conference paper for the conference I'm going to in April.  I got the shooting scripts for the two movies ( urlLink  Practical Magic   &  urlLink  Witches of Eastwick  ).  They'll come in handy when I'm trying to quote the films.  It's amazing what the Internet can provide us nowadays.  You think-- surely, somewhere, someone has done this work for me-- and yup. There it is.  So far, I've noticed a couple of minor errors in the transcription of PM, but I don't mind too much.  It'll save me some major major typing.   I is a good good girl.  :)  *from now on, I'm doing movie & book titles in bold instead of italics.  I don't like the way italics looks on the page-- it scrunches them together too much.  However, in true academic nerd fashion, I have to say this cause it IS a departure from MLA format.  I know.  No one but me cares.  Just FYI.

      Just in case you were wondering about why I think the characters in the  Lord of the Rings  are gay.  Read their  urlLink Very Secret Diaries  and the continuing  urlLink Journals .    Then, when you're done playing around with silly journaly things, check out  urlLink Mr. Picassohead .  So far, I am not thrilled with my creation.  But I will, if I ever really like it, post it.

       Elderly Father-in-Law Pummeled to Death With Carry-On-Luggage   In case you were wondering, it is NOT okay to be a complete hour late picking up someone who has been sitting around all morning in airports and on uncomfortable airline seats.  Especially because you just didn't bother to leave to pick them up until you heard from them that the plane had landed, and then you ran out of gas.  (Fill the tank up BEFORE you leave, please).  Unless of course it's a clever ruse to get them to never ask you for a favor, the old avoiding the "please pick me up at the airport" bit.  It's really much nicer to say "no, I can't pick you up" than to just make it a huge pain in the ass for you to be relied upon.    Crazy Irate Airline Passenger Gets His Butt (and Presumably Other Body Parts Too) Arrested   In case you were wondering, if a plane you're supposed to be flying on has a "minor mechanical issue" that keeps it from taking off for hours (really, we'd rather it break on the ground thank you very much Mr. Maintenance-- and that's not sarcasm), it's totally NOT okay to turn into Mr. Hyde and try to rip a flight-attendant and a gate-ticket guy's head off.  What will happen when we finally leave the broken airplane to be "Re-routed" is that you, Mr. Mild-appearing Crazy-man will be "Re-routed" to the police station, and get some lovely photos you may or may not choose to share with the grandkids.  And maybe some fingerprints.  This also goes for the road-rage bristley pitt-bull of a man who did the "sarcastic guy applause" when they announced the first delay.  Just because you buy tickets on an airplane does not entitle you to be qualified to demand the plane leave ON TIME when the thing breaks.  Things break, Mr. Angrypants.  It has happened to me a total of ONCE in many  many years of airplane flying, so I figure, they really do have a pretty good record.     And yes.  I did have an okay time driving Andrew back to Shreveport & then coming home again.  Mostly.  You do meet the most interesting  blog characters,  people, when traveling.

       Math Is Hard Barbie     Sweet .  For years I have been trying to figure out which Barbie was the one who pissed off feminists (of which I freely admit I am one, although mathematically challenged).  Merely mentioning it in conversation tonight led Uncle Bob to find it online.   urlLink Teen Talk Barbie .  I have a "high bid" on ebay right now to get her.  I believe too that math is hard, and that shopping is fun.  I want her.  Desperately.  I know it sells out all the feminist principles on which my life is supposedly based.  Screw it.  I am an enigma wrapped in a mystery.

        Happy New Year!    Well we had a very nice party at a friend's house-- photos are  urlLink here  if you wanna see.  I've started using the online ofoto service cause it's easier than doing a whole spread myself in HTML and my server for womenwriters is a little full.  So if you want to see lots of photos where I carefully positioned the camera for my best angles, check em out.    Andrew goes back to Shreveport tomorrow, and then I start my "new job" Monday-- writing full time to get the damned dissertation done.  Andrew's dad said "you ain't doin' that... you aint finished it in a year".  GRRRR.  I do not like it when people assume because I'm not done with it I haven't worked on it.  I have. Dammit.  It just takes a lot of work and is hard.  What have you done lately?    Anyway.  I may cut back on blogging a bit, so that the computer doesn't suck me into that vortex known as the online community, where the writing I do doesn't get me a job.  But I'll try to do something every day-- it just might be more of a "quickie."

      Ugh.  I just wrote checks for a bunch of bills, and officially have very tiny amount left in my account.  Andrew usually pays the bills; I give him a check now and then but he does all the writing of the bills and stuff.  Man, that sucks!  In a space of several minutes, I went from a respectable account balance to one that wouldn't get me a good shopping spree.  BLEAH!!  And I only have one more stamp left too.  It just gets worse & worse.  I mean, what do we really need house and car insurance for, right?  I say, screw them!  Let's go buy a leather bustier!  As someone wise once said, "it lifts AND separates!"   I also cleaned my office.  Yes.  Miracle of miracles; there are empty desktops in here.  And I've thrown away lots of crap.  The sad part is by the time Andrew gets back in May, I'm sure it'll be a mess again.  I know my tendencies to make a mess in here.  Now I need a shower (cause paying all those bills made me need to go to a happy place.)    How is your day going?

      Went to an "aerobathon"-- which was, for me 2.5 hours of working out.  Fun & sweaty.  Not the sort of sweaty fun I usually prefer, but then, with the husband out of town, it's all I got.  :)    But that and a few other cool thingys made for a very short day.  I can't even think of anything at all cool to write in this blog; hence the rambling personal info.  Watch this spot for interesting facts, coming soon.

      Last night, about 3 am (so really, this morning) there was an owl in my back yard (or close enough to my backyard to be heard by me, in my bed).  Tituba (my cat) was totally unconcerned.  Eventually, neighbor dogs "kicked up a ruckus" and the owl quieted down.  I lay there and seethed about neighbors with noisy dogs for a while and went back to sleep.    However, some big owls do scoop up "small mammals."  So we'll be keeping an eye on the back yard for a while.  I doubt it was one of the big ones.  The web says we get Western & Eastern Screech owls around these parts.  It sounded a bit like the  urlLink Western one's  call.    Kind of neat though.  Whodathunk that you could get an owl in the middle of suburbia?  I mean, we're not exactly Texas Hill Country here-- I'm walking (yes a long walk but still) distance from a Starbuck's-- this aint no wilderness!  But these kinds of owls do turn up in suburbs.  A lovely photo of them on the Internet says a small Eastern Screech owl family  urlLink was found in a trailer park's tree .   (Scroll down to the one with several grey owls.)

      Should I be alarmed that after far too long reading blogs this morning, my  urlLink Kuan Yin  statue*, which is normally perched on top of my monitor to encourage me to be compassionate when responding to irritating emails (sometimes she really keeps me in check), fell off and clunked the back of the computer, almost the window?  Or that, when I was trying to replace her in her normal spot on top, with mauve silk scarf nestled about her, that she fell, again, almost clunking the keyboard and/or my fingers?  Kuan Yin, what are you trying to tell me?  ::listens:: "work on your dissertation you idiot"  Hmm.  I suppose she's right.     UPDATE   On leaving the computer room, I realized that I had left the cat outside for a long time. She was at the door, meowing pitifully.  I'm fairly sure that somehow, she is responsible for Kuan Yin's actions earlier.  Because getting me off the computer is usually Tituba's job-- she comes in (as she's doing RIGHT NOW) and yells at me with sad little meows.  So.  With her outside, Kuan Yin HAD to step in.   *she looks a lot like this one, except for an inspiring flame flaring up behind her....

      Find out who your  urlLink Senator  is and write to them about the ridiculousness of the "Marriage Amendement" and urge them to focus on issues that really matter, like the War in Iraq and the economy.  I just wrote to my US Senators as well as my state Senators, and my  urlLink Representative .  Write one letter, and then copy & paste the same thing to each one, changing, of course, the names.  Most of them have email links and it's quite easy to do this.  Carefully compose your letter, and spell check it, and paste it into the form they have on their websites.  You can also write to the  urlLink White House .  I was going to put mine in here for you to see, but I inadvertantly deleted the damn thing before I got here.  But it basically reminded them that I am a registered voter (always good to point out) and that I lived in the district they represent.  And plan on voting, and remembering the behavior of the lawmakers I send to office at the polling place.  So don't threaten, but remind them gently that this is not acceptable-- to distract the public with a "hot topic" social issue, to "wag the dog" and not talk about real issues.   I'm sure you know how I feel about gay marriage (or you do if you've read my blog) but it's more than that.  It's a seriously frivolous issue-distracting election year tactic to talk about Amending the Constitution to define marriage as between a man and woman.  Even if I didn't support gay marriage, I would think this.  As I've said before, how about an Amendement saying marriage should be between two members of the same race only?  It would have been something a majority agreed with about 50 years ago.  So.  Now I really should do some work.  But I'm so insanely irritated that this is going on right now I just HAD to say something to my elected officials.  (Who I am really mad at anyway right now.  There's just no pleasing me anyway.)

      Last night I dreamt that the witches from the TV show  urlLink Charmed  (not the actresses, the actual characters in the show) had this wonderful blog, and I met them because I read the blog.  They were wondeful, and very nice, and we hung out and they asked me to become part of their blog circle.  I guess, in analyzing the dream, I'd have to say it relates to several things.  The first is that I'm thinking all the time about the witch issue, trying really hard to focus on writing my intro to my dissertation (which, right now, is grappling with how to define my theoretical feminism).  The second is that I'm clearly spending a lot of time on blogs.  So the subconscious says "hmm.  okay.  let's put this there, and that here, and voila!  a dream!)  But I woke up with a clear sense of loss, wishing that I COULD hang out with the witches from Charmed.  Again, not the actresses (although I'm sure they're lovely women.)  I hate it when I have dreams like that; the ones that seem so real it's hard fo face the humdrum, cold & windy day, with an annoying, smelly cat on your lap (who is now actually being cute and has popped herself into a drawer) and too much work to do.

       Check out  urlLink this wonderful idea .... I just donated some money, since it's way too late to actually call a florist, plus, this way, there's some community involvement, and if the marriages "stop" then there's a fund somewhere that someone can use to maybe donate to charity that will keep this going.  Anyway.  This animation is from a webblog by  urlLink sunnedaae .

      Amazingly, while I find it, sometimes, difficult to find time to write my dissertation, exercise, or read research towards said dissertation, I can spend hours on a  urlLink free polyphonic phone ringtones  website downloading yours and my favorites, like "Red Red Wine" and "Copacabana."  WHOOO!    UPDATE:   Oh, and if you go there and see that your phone is not listed as compatible, try it anyway.  Mine was not listed, and my phone worked fine.  I actually wrote to the guy who hosts the site and told him about my phone, so it may end up there eventually.  But this is just so you know-- try one.    Actually, I exaggerate.  I did a lot of work today, albeit mostly reading a book on anti-feminism that's made me quite confused.  So.  And I did work out.  But the story is better the other way, no?  Also: I have this theory that when we get old, and a bit senile, we're a lot like we are when we're young and very drunk. So (based on recent behavior of me while drunk) one day, I'm going to be "crazy old running down the street while tearing her clothes off lady."  Wanna move into a home with me when we're 90?  You'll probably get to see me naked.  :)

      Okay, I've noticed that a bunch of people hit my site yesterday, looking for what the song is that Carmen & Dave are using for their wedding.  Folks, a little careful research can find ANYTHING on the Internet.  It's a lovely song, by Sade, called " urlLink By Your Side ."  You can hear the couple talking about it on the MTV website,  urlLink see a video of them talking about it .    You can get the song on the  urlLink Lover's Rock  album.   You can also get it on Rhapsody.  Anyway. Just a service from me to you.    And that's officially the LAST time I think I'll mention the reality show.  Apparently I have been a bit obsessed.  I know how to get that "internet fame" that's so elusive-- mention some hot topic of the moment in your blog.  I wish it'd been this easy to get myself listed in search engines way back when I first made my  urlLink www.womenwriters.net  website!  That took ages of hand submission.

      Last night's blog post makes really no sense to me either.  Mostly it was put there to remember what I was looking at (the video that I've been told I would enjoy) for later, but the post just looks very silly in the light of day.  That kind of thing you think is quite funny when you're a bit tipsy, but sober just looks like ranting.   No more of that, then!  I'm recovering today from a night of too many "absolut hunks."  They were quite tasty, but lethal, as hunks tend to be.  They technically weren't Absolut hunks since I was using Smirnoff, but same old same old.  I can't generally tell much difference between brand names, and they all do the same thing (things you regret later and tell yourself you'll never do again).  I hope I didn't do anything too embarrassing, but I know when Nissa and I went to the airport to pick up Aaron, we were very, very silly.  People looked at us quite funny.  And Aaron was amused, in that way that a poor sober person who's had a long day can only be when confronted with two totally liquored up people.  May I just extend a group apology to everyone?  There.  That's over with.    Today, as part of my recovery, I watched the movie  urlLink Underworld .  One of my favorite film critics, Mary Ann Johanson, the "Flick Philosopher" did  urlLink a review  of the movie that I read a while back that starts with the query of whether, when you become a vampire, you're issued the "proper" vampire wardrobe.  I had been told the movie was bad, but good, in a way, by others who like vampire stuff.  Kind of "you have to see it just cause."  So, feeling kind of crappy anyway, and not at all good to do anything productive today, I figured what the hell.  Mary Ann's not right every single time, and while I like reading her reviews for sheer fun writing and often agree with her, there have been notable exceptions (the Hulk, for one).  I thought the movie was okay.  It was a bit over the top on "dark creepy places" and deep, vibrating guitar chords that are supposed to evoke GOTH sensibilities.  It also has this voice over thing that is supposed to lend itself to thinking "wow, there's going to be a sequel" and getting you all excited about the idea of all out vampire/lycan hybrids and stuff. I like vampire stuff, but am not obsessed with it.  I would say watch the movie if you are at all into the genre, but if you can take it or leave it, don't go out of your way.  It's okay, and I don't regret the purchase (got it on pay per view) but there are better things to do with one's time.  Like take a nap.  Which I'm going to do right now.

       Tidbits Last night I had several dreams (I can dream serially-- you know, you wake up, and then when you go back to sleep you can start the same dream over again?) about  urlLink Dave Navarro & Carmen Electra's  wedding.  Probably cause I had just watched the show on MTV.  I dreamt they were going to have their wedding here at my house, and I was scurrying around trying to get it all ready for the wedding guests to arrive.  It was an odd dream.  Neither Dave nor Carmen were actually in the dream-- but presumably, they would have eventually shown up.  You know. In case that fabulously expensive Hollywood thing didn't work out, they'd be up for a small house in a suburb of Texas.    Also, today we're doing a "last episode of  urlLink Sex in the City " party at my place.  I'm serving good food, lots of martini type drinks.  Wanna come?  I even got these cute napkins with a Carrie-esque dress on them.    For the continuing adventures of Kim @ Starbuck's, overheard from one of the young employees the other day while waiting for my latte:  Why don't they, instead of experimenting on animals, use prisoners?  This was said with no sense of irony.  Cause, you know, once someone has committed a crime, they are not only no longer human, they are sub-animal, too.  She didn't even specify "really bad evil mean criminals."  So be careful, if said Starbuck's employee becomes queen of the world one day.  Don't cheat on your taxes or write a bad check.  Cause then you could go to jail and become a human sub-guinea pig.  It's not that I'm all for poking animals in the eye with toxic chemicals, but this is a bit on the absurd side.    Finally, for those of you who have been following the Bulimia Kitty episodes-- I think I may have discovered the bizarre thing that is causing her to be sick sometimes.  Chicken flavored cat food.  She hadn't had any for a while, and yesterday she did, and yesterday she threw up again.  So.  That only makes a weird sort of sense.  But whoever heard of a cat allergic to chicken?  Apparently, mine is.  We'll see-- no more chicken flavored food, and if she doesn't puke, then that's it!  Yay!  It would be very nice if she would get back to normal.

        I just watched the HBO movie about the Suffrage movement of the 1900s, the "First Wave" feminist  urlLink Alice Paul  and her struggle, along with the  urlLink National Women's Party , to gain the right to vote for women.  The  urlLink 19th Amendment  seems like "old hat" I think to most of us today.    But how old is the issue, really?  I remember once when I was teaching, my first class as a Graduate Student, and we were describing Feminist critical theory to the classroom of college students, and one young black woman asked "what's the point?"  The three of us grad students were a bit surprised.  It seemed like the point of something like a feminist interpretation of the world ought to be obvious, and that any woman would understand that the fight for women's equality is still not over.  The 19th amendment was an early step.  But there are so many more steps to be taken even 80 years later.    The movie was excellent.  Yes, it was a bit melodramatic, showing the forced feeding of the women who went on a hunger strike to force public opinion to recognize the issue.  The open hostility of some men (and women) to the women who were asking merely for the right to vote, which I know most of us take for granted, chilled me to the bone because I see that open hostility in a very slightly lesser degree when men say "ah, feminists are all lesbian agitators who hate men and want to kill babies."  How easy is it to go from words like that to the open violence that has been done, to chains and prison bars?  I'm not really sure it's as far away as I've liked to believe.  In that same class I mentioned earlier, when the professor asked students to critique our performance so far about halfway through the semester, a whole lot of students wrote "tell the grad students to shut up".  They also wrote disparagements of us being women.  They were anonymous, and the hostility of some of those little notes shows the hidden hostility of a lot of people to anyone who refuses to say that what has happened so far is enough.    I know a lot of people, and definitely men, support equality for everyone.  Including women.  But there are still an awful lot of people who think that what we have today, where women still make a percentage of the money that men make, and women are not fully represented in political power, is enough.  I say it is not.    The movie made me cry, and think about how much I myself take for granted as a woman who has the right to an education, the right to vote (even if I have no frickin' idea who to vote for), the right to control my own life.  Just a couple of days ago I wondered, as that young black woman whose words struck me to the heart years ago, "what's the point" in this very blog.  What's the point of my dissertation, which argues about feminism in popular media, and the image of the witch as feminist/feminist as witch?    This movie reminds me quite powerfully of the point.  The public opinion of feminism has been slipping for a long time, what with Rush Limbaugh's smear campaign and the repeated declarations by different media outlets of feminism's death, or irrelevancy.  But in a world where women are still 50% of the population but not represented fully in our own government, where even in this First World country where we have incredible privilege, we still are told, as children, we can't do that cause we're a girl, there's nothing irrelevant about feminism.  If that makes me strident, or antagonistic to those who would keep me from speaking out and saying it's still unfair, unequal, and wrong, and pointing out that feminism is NOT dead, and we don't have to apologize for our belief that equality matters, then so be it.    The website at HBO has a page on  urlLink Suffrage history .  It also has pictures and interviews.  But check out other places too, and learn more about The First Wave, even as we, and I, declare ourselves part of a third wave.  It's still the same ocean.

      Boy was I ever cranky yesterday and this morning.  I swear, when I was young (back in the day) I was not such a slave to hormones, but now.  I am going to be the biggest bitch on wheels one day when I hit menopause (in a very long time; I'm still just a baby).     So in honor of better moods, let's see, what should we do?  I'm thinking of composing my own feminist manifesta-- partly inspired by a couple of them I saw on other websites.  I thought about it last night while trying to coax myself into sleep, and I have some ideas.  It also fits nicely with the research I'm doing right now for the dissertation.  So coming soon:  Kim's Brand O' Feminism.  Under New Management!  Remodeled!  With Extra Zing and Brand M special sauce!  But today, I think I might go get my hair cut.  It's a big dangerous activity when your hair is as long as mine, so if Rhonda my favorite hair dresser isn't available, I might chicken out.

       urlLink Ben, of Ben & Jerry's , explains the Federal Budget using Oreos.  Check it out.  And, while a pretty good sized part of my family's budget comes from that military pile of cookies, and a lot of other people's, I still can get behind most of the principles.  Those military budget cookies paid for my college (still are) my teeth being fixed (no thanks to my dad, I needed LOTS of work) and the house I live in.  Remember, the military budget also pays a lot of salaries-- not just expensive bombs and stuff.  It sends a lot of people to college (GI Bill) and those folks sacrafice a lot for their money (for example, why is my husband gone for six months and I'm lonely temporarily single woman?)  That same hubby says that we probably could do with about half the military budget-- but a lot of that money goes to "research" and "boondoggles" like the old Bloom County cartoon alleged (with the basset hound bit-- SDI initiative... remember it?)    Anyway.  I still like the video from Ben.

       To:  The two women at Starbuck's who chatted loudly while I was CLEARLY trying to work (and there first), and trying desperately to ignore your inane conversation while I tried to read about feminist reader response theory and how it could change the world.     When you loudly (despite that you clearly thought you were being covert) read your Visa number over the cell phone to someone, all the while peeking suspiciously over your shoulder at me, while your friend giggled, and I again  tried my best  to ignore your blatant rudeness, IF I had wanted to, I would  so  have gotten your credit card number.  Yes, I was sitting with my five dollar coffee and chocolate chip cookie, with my laptop, several books, and pad of paper and pen. Yes, I was in a suburban mall's Starbucks, normal-looking and tricked out in my sterling silver, platinum earrings, and other various trappings of middle-class respectability.  But I could have gotten your damn number cause you were sitting, like, two feet away from me!  I simply didn't need or want your damned credit card number, so what was the point of acting as though I was just sitting there, lying in wait to write it down and go on a spending spree on E-bay?    If you're soooo worried about a woman hearing your conversation, here's a little tip.   Take. Your.  Damned. Phone. Conversation.  Elsewhere.     If you're having a "private" phone conversation in the middle of a public place, you have no right to glare at me because I might overhear you.  Public cell phone conversation does not equal right to privacy.  And don't think I was too stupid to notice your little surreptitious glances, and the glee of your friend as you made me the butt of your blockheaded jokes.  As I said earlier-- we were like two feet away from each other.   Please don't anyone else make my current misanthropic mood any worse.  Why am I trying to bother to read about feminist theoretical world-shattering rhetoric to write my "change the world" dissertation when ungrateful bimbos in medical scrubs while NOT at work are being rude in Starbuck's?  What's the fucking point?!  At least the guy in the work t-shirt, smoking furiously and gesturing wildly while on his phone conversation, had the grace to take it outside.

      Just to make up for two serious, intellectual, floobety (that's a word I made up) entries, here's a silly one.  I want this  urlLink cake pan .    And see,  urlLink this  is my poetic license.  It's laminated, and I carry it in my wallet so that when someone says "is floobety a word?" I can say it is, and I have a right to make up words cause I have a poetic license.    Want one of your own?   urlLink email me .  You'll need Microsoft Publisher to edit it easily.  But I can do Photoshop too-- it'll be up to you to edit it.

      I am happily married to my hubby for almost 11 years now.  It was so easy for us to get married-- we planned for about six months, had the religious ceremony, and then popped in to City Hall for the "official" paperwork and presto chango, we were "official."  I think that the law has nothing to do with what you feel in your heart, but I also think that the legal paperwork and a simple one ceremony deal binding two lives, the declaring of your intent in front of everyone, is an important part of the marriage deal.  I do not think that marriage is only okay "between a man and a woman" as many of the lawmakers are trying to make it.  So I'm thinking a lot about this stuff in San Francisco with  urlLink gay marriage .  I have to say that it does not hurt my marriage at all if two people of the same sex want to also get married.  All those pundits who talk about how gays are immoral and have a promiscuous lifestyle are also the same folks who don't want them to take the conservative route towards marriage and monogamy.  Talk about ridiculous.  I feel so bad for people who really want to get married, and the law says "you're not allowed" because it is SO easy for heterosexuals-- maybe too easy-- and marriage is important.  Men & women screw marriage up all the time-- they pervert the love and so-called morals of marriage for many reasons, from marrying for money, to marrying to piss people off, to marrying for immigration issues, or even because they are alone & scared that they won't ever really find love so why not this person?  Gays marrying are trying to say to the world that they are serious about this relationship.  It's ridiculous to say they can't legally bind their lives together.  Think about the idea of your loved one dying, and you not being able to be in the hospital with them because you're not "family."  This is a biggie and it's something many gays have to deal with all the time.    And I think I've ranted about this before here-- I know I have in "real life" talked this over with others.  Gays have every right to marriage-- marriage is not a holy writ from God. (Did we get the invitation from Adam & Eve?  Nope. They weren't "legally" married cause there was no law!  They were shacking up!)    The Christian church of the middle ages didn't even sanction marriage AT ALL between a man and woman, preferring instead celibacy as a path to purity and godliness.  So while we talk about the tradition of marriage as "between man and woman" we have to realize that even that so-called "standard" can be called into question, and when politics and times changed, so did the practice of marriage.  Barbara Walker's   urlLink Women's Encyclopedia of Myths and Secrets   has a great entry on this which is where I get my ideas about it.  The church wouldn't allow marriages past the church door for a long time; it was NOT a sacrament, and pagan religions took care of it.   I couldn't for the life of me find the book today to quote from it.  (Damned messy office).  My point is that those saying marriage is a sacred union between a man and woman don't know the history of marriage very well.    But a little bit of Internet search has found a bit of what I wanted to say:   urlLink Bartleby.com  explains:    The Latin Fathers debated matters of sexuality and marriage. In the ancient world, many thinkers, both Gentile and Jewish, held that sexual relations between man and woman hindered the soul's rise to higher things.      Bartleby also tells us:  With this benign attitude, however, there gradually emerged a strong current of negativism toward the body, of hostility toward sexuality. The Fathers took for granted the superiority of celibacy (total abstinence from all sexual activity) over marriage. Thus, Jerome denigrated marriage; Augustine held marriage to be &#147;a cure forconspicuouse,&#148; with procreation the only truly moral use of, or justification for, sexuality. As in the ancient world, marriage remained a private arrangement,  not the concern of civil authorities . Recent historians have disputed the early Christian attitude toward homosexuality. Some scholars argue that early Christian thinkers had a tolerant and positive position on male love and eroticism as being natural; other modern writers claim the Fathers condemned same-sex love and activity.     So what I think here is that we can argue till we turn blue in the face about what God wants (as if we know what  she  thinks) and we can argue about the intent of early society but we change rules ALL THE TIME when it suits us. People used to think it was perfectly legitimate/legal/moral to  own another human being .  We changed that, rightfully so.  So even if people used to think that marriage should only be between a man and a woman (or not at all, as my quotes above show) we change these laws all the time.  Law used to say it was perfectly fine to beat your wife as long  as the stick wasn't bigger than your thumb .  We changed that (again, rightfully so).    Law is alive-- it shifts and grows and changes with our beliefs.  If you look at  urlLink polls  it does seem that an awful lot of people oppose the idea of gay marriage.  But I don't know why this is-- and what the questions were, and the polling sample, etc.  What do people who oppose gay marriage really oppose?  My guess is that they oppose homosexuality in general-- and would prefer gays just not be gay.    If you took away the heterosexism, and asked if two people who love each other and want to devote their lives to each other and have legal rights should have that right, I suspect those people would say "of course the state has no right to intrude" and that it is ridiculous to say a Constitutional ammendment should be written forbidding it.  Look at it this way.  Change "should gays be allowed to get married" to "should black people" or "should Latinos" or "should Catholics and Protestants" be allowed to get married-- and you'll see the terrible bias built in to the question.  If it isn't okay for one minority group to be excluded, it isn't okay for ANY.    I think, (here comes the conspiracy theory) that it has a lot more to do with the fact that if we allow gay marriage, insurance companies, and other monetarily powerful businesses will have to fork over a lot of cash.  Any big resistance to change has almost always been about money.  So get off the high moral horse, lawmakers, and allow gay marriage.  They have every right to screw it up or make it work as the rest of us.  Heterosexism is just as bad as any ISM.

      Yes.  That's what we had for dinner on V-Day.  It was nice (home made, in his tiny little BOQ room).  We also had wine, and Frangelico-tinis, and some Godiva chocolate.  MMMMM.  Godiva.  Oh, the next day we had some strawberries that smelled intensely like summer & champagne.  We watched a movie (umm, I think that night it was Under the Tuscan Sun-- good chick flick, surprising that his crew member-- a guy-- owned it.)  Just in case you wanted to get the dirt on Valentine's Day for the Wellses.  It was rainy, very cold, and icky in S'port.  Nicer the next day, but mostly, we just "hung out."    But Godiva chocolate.  I like the ones with the chocolate.  (in other words, all of them).

      When I was in Shreveport with the husband the last time, we strolled through the collection of airplanes at the small museum on base. The base has what seems to me a fairly good sized (considering the smallness of the museum) collection of airplanes, including big ones like B52s and other big bombers.  What struck me while I was looking at these planes up close was that most of them have been stripped, sanded, of any of the old nose art they used to have.  You could see the pattern on one silver plane where the painting had been-- it had been a bomb with shapely women's legs coming out of it-- but the paint had been sanded off the plane very carefully.  The fact that you could still make out the picture also reminded me of the subversive practice of pagans carving their own gods into the robes of Christian statues in cathedrals-- it was still sort of there, if you looked closely enough and "between the lines."  But I'm not sure that was intentional.    I asked the hubby about it and he said that in his air group, they have one plane left that has the air nose art of a woman on it.  You know what I'm talking about-- those cool, pinup style pictures that used to grace the fronts of airplanes.  One of the most famous is probably  the  Memphis Belle art, but there are lots of vintage style women on planes; I'm sure the artists' inspiration and airplane's name gave lots of room for variation.  Some of them  were  a little risque-- some of the replications I've seen on the Internet do not leave a lot of room for the imagination.  But the art, to me, has always been a beautiful part of vintage airplanes-- and the reason why I figured it's not on modern air craft was just lack of time and/or inclination for other reasons.  Virgin Airlines' logo harkens back to the practice, and I love it for that reason.    But I begin to wonder if there's not some sort of policital correctness gone wrong here.  Perhaps it's a problem that people think now that there are women involved more readily in aviation, they'll be offended or feel objectified by the women on the planes so they'd better scour any trace of them off the plane before it's too late, and our delicate sensibilities are wounded.  Or that perhaps there were actual women who complained, for those same sorts of reasons, and the military, smarting from past problems (cough Tailhook scandal cough) and really overly sensitive and quite eager to avoid anything that could get them into trouble again, removed anything left over for fear of offense.  Trust me when I say, from an insider's perspective, that the military is quite worried about its public image, and doesn't want people to think that it's all boobs, beer, and bombs (anymore).  (How do you like that clever alliteration? Hmmm?)  To the point where military gatherings are realllllly boring most of the time, and everyone leaves as soon as possible, because everyone is way worried about doing something inappropriate.  (And the few occasions where something remotely inappropriate did happen, it was swiftly dealt with).     But this removal of the art, the careful sanding to eradicate any piece of something that someone might or might not be disturbed by is horrible to me.  The idea that the mere picture of a sexy woman on an airplane from the 1940s would cause me to feel all "dirty-need-a-shower" bothers me a whole lot.  It reminds me, in fact, of the idea that women must be veiled from head to toe, with only her eyes peeking out, or else perhaps she might inflame the lust of males by her mere ankle showing, and, because of women's inherent lust and vile corruptiblity, it is for her protection that she be covered up. To protect her from herself.  The assumption that sexy pinup women would offend me is a worse sort of offense, in that way, than seeing the suggestion of nipples under the painted-on shirt of a vintage pinup girl on a B52.    I think, and I'm fairly sure that any historian would back this up, that the art on airplanes served two purposes.  One:  it reminded men (often terribly young ones) who were alone and very far from home, being shot at and perhaps dying, of what they were fighting for (the home front, love, family, and yes, sex).  Two:  it was very like the old fashioned  urlLink figureheads  on the fronts of ships from "days of yore."  Those figureheads were there for a lot of reasons, too-- including protection from evil, as well as representations of the "soul" of the ship.  So no, it's not that aviators are dirty minded lechers out to corrupt the hearts and minds of the world.  It's not that they want to do some vile damage to the purity of womanhood.  It's sort of a long-standing tradition, and the loss of it pains me greatly if it is political correctness, and I'm sad that something related partly to women's insistence that we not be treated as inferior, might have something to do with.  If so, it's truly a misrepresentation of the concept of objectification.    It's truly a sign that women are not equal that we still have to worry about whether someone looking at our boobs means they are not respecting us as equal.  (Does that make sense?)  If we really were equal, it wouldn't matter at all.     To see more air nose art, check out the following webpages:   urlLink http://www.airpowermuseum.org/trartgal.html#exhibitlist    urlLink http://www.nose-art.net/index.html    There's also a couple of calendars and book collections, if you feel really strongly about it.

      I remembered that "funny" story my friend said I should put in the blog.   It takes a while to get funny, and it's probably better "orally" but I'll give it a shot.  If nothing else, it's a good record of a wonderful trip.    In Summer 2002, my husband had business in London for three weeks.  It was a wonderful opportunity for me to go with and see a place that, as an English major, is quite important to me.  And one of the coolest cities on the planet.  So we arranged for me to go: London or Bust!    Somewhere along the way, we also arranged to have my husband's parents go with too.  Jim is Andrew's dad, and is a huge, extremely loud, tall, 70 year old rednecky Texan (he really does define the word " urlLink cracker ").  Often, even in a crowd of hundreds of people, you can pick out Jim towering over everyone else.  People come to call him "Big Jim" after a while.  Joanne, my mother in law, also went, but she wasn't the part of the trip that was maddening.  Jim was.  He was the one who had me, after a few days, pointing out that England doesn't have the death penalty so the worst punishment I would face if I strangled Jim in his sleep and dumped him at the pig farm we passed just outside of  urlLink Stonehenge  was that I would end up in prison. I tell you, there were days when that seemed like an option I could live with.  One of those days was our trip to  urlLink Canterbury  and the exquisite  urlLink Leeds Castle .  Canterbury cathedral is famous, and probably most famous as the site where the pilgrims in Chaucer's  urlLink Canterbury Tales  are traveling towards.  It's also famous for the  urlLink martyring  of the Bishop of Canterbury, Thomas Becket, in the cathedral on  December 29, 1170.  Henry II said, offhandedly, something like "I wish someone would get rid of that irritating Bishop for me" and four knights did so, somewhat gruesomely.  It's not really the sort of place where people go to try to cure their leprosy, or some other terrible affliction.  That's more  urlLink Lourdes  cathedral in France.    We took a day trip to the two places, which aren't really far from London, and if you are ever there, I  highly  recommend the  urlLink London Walks  company for this and other trips.  But, knowing it was a long day, and that we would not have much time for lunch, and pubs that cater to tourists are notoriously SLOW, I packed these delicious little take-away sandwiches from the grocery next to our incredible  urlLink hotel .  (This section is very gushy-- but I did love these elements of the trip).  I brought these great sandwiches, which included one that was Thai Chicken with bits of cilantro and spicy ginger, and some great Scottish shortbread cookies, and bottles of water, and cheese.  It was a long day and I carried these sandwiches and snacks, weighing in at least 10 pounds, in a backpack all day.  (This background explains why it was soooo irritating when Jim did what he did later).    When we got to Canterbury cathedral, we toured the site.  I walked alone down the marble steps in one section, which were slightly worn down, bowed in the center from centuries of pilgrim feet, touching the handrail, thinking of all the people who have been where I had been.  It was cool and dark inside, except where sunlight was streaming gloriously through the stained glass windows on one side of the cathedral.  It was, if not spiritual, one of the most peaceful, zenlike experiences I've ever had as a tourist.  (I also got a quirky little silver charm for my trip charm bracelet of the Wife of Bath on her donkey.  But that's a  different  sort of tourist experience).    We found a bench outside, under the trees, and I passed out the sandwiches I had so thoughtfully packed.  I looked over, after a while, and my father in law, Jim, had squished down the bread corners of his sandwich and wadded them into unkempt little balls of pathetic white dough, squished into the flimsy plastic triangle package.  Puzzled, I asked if he just didn't like that flavor or what?  He replied that it bothered him to not have washed his hands first, you know, after being someplace where there were centuries of people like lepers and stuff walking around.  The funny part about this, and the part you get when I am telling this story to you in person, is Jim's loud Texas accent-- he's half deaf, so nothing is said quietly. People looked at us with puzzled eyes as he was "hollering" about lepers and stuff.  Honestly.  It was the first time I truly understood the Knights chasing the Bishop through Canterbury with intense blood lust.  Perhaps I was temporarily possessed by one of them.  Luckily for Jim, Henry II was not paying me to "take out" any loud Texans that day and I didn't have a sword handy at that moment.    Herein lies the famous "lepers of Canterbury" we've all heard so much about, then.    (I had brought along bottles of the anti-bacterial stuff you can get at Bath & Body Works-- which honestly, will kill pretty much anything you need to worry about, being almost all alcohol.... but that just didn't convince Jim, for whom this pattern was repeated the day we went to  urlLink Oxford  & the Cotswolds.)  Yes.  Oxford worried him too.  I know that Oxford was one of the earliest recorded places of the Black  urlLink plague  in the middle ages, but I'm fairly certain they have that under control nowadays.    So this is the story I told the other night that had people gasping for breath.  Perhaps it has to do with my skill as an actor (LINE!) or that they'd had a few margaritas, or that they know Jim, and could picture it well.  Who knows.  It doesn't, to me, read all that funny right now.  But I'm sure you'll find it a good "travel story."    Just be careful if you ever go to Canterbury. Watch out for the lepers hiding in the corners.  They'll jump out and contaminate your sandwich, you know.

      A good friend is in town visiting and last night several members of "the gang" all went out to Flats & the Candlelight.  While there, I drank two big pots of Earl Grey (hot) tea and got wired and goofy.  Vickie worried that I was drunk, but nope, it's just the natural wackiness of Kim brought on by too much bergamot and faux sugar.  I told some silly story that had people laughing a whole lot, and Vickie said "you should put that in your blog."  But dammit, I cannot, now that the Earl Grey is out of the system, remember what story it was I was supposed to tell you all.  And that, my friends, sucks big ones.  Perhaps V. will remind me in a comment.  :)    What was a moment I remember is that the Candlelight had a very large crowd of very pretty young men there, with their long curly eyelashes and cute bottoms, they were better than the dessert counter.  I looked around and said, with a sigh, "it's hard being a girl here tonight."  (What with two "dessert counters," neither of which I was going to partake).  There were not very many girls there, so one might think we girls would have been the center of attention.  No, dear reader.  These cute bottoms were not at all interested in MY bottom as they "play for the other team."  But that doesn't mean a girl can't look, sistah!  Cute bottoms in tight jeans and warm flannel shirts and fuzzy sweaters galore, and no guilt!  Why, it was like a big giant fat free salad with extra radicchio and tomatoes and a sparkling water with a lime!  No commitment, and all the fun of eye-candy!  On other news, I'm trying to decide if I should take the weekend trip to Shreveport again to spend the commercial romance holiday with the spousal unit.  I was there last weekend, and while I would like to see him every single day, I just hate being out of town every single weekend.  I like being home!  And the cat hates being left by herself so much and makes me feel like a bad mom when I leave her.  So if I don't go, I'm going to help out A&D at their Greek restaurant on Saturday night.  They're having a raucous wine tasting party.  Woo yeah, and, OPA!  And, with kind regards to single folks, Valentine's Day just doesn't mean as much when your heart is given to someone every single day of the year.  And he buys you chocolate whenever you want it, and you buy  yourself      flowers  whenever you want them.  It's just another Saturday, really.  But it IS a three day weekend for "government types."  So I'm thinkin' about it.  We'll see what happens.  Luckily, with my special flight privileges, I don't have to buy a ticket till I get to the airport (i.e., no advance planning needed.)

      When I was a kid, we were incredibly poor for a while.  My mom & dad had split, and my mom, as a single mom, had to quit her nursing training (which at the stage she was at didn't pay the bills) to become a bartender.  I'm sure I don't have to tell a lot of folks how little cash comes in when you're a bartender, and how hard it is if you have three kids to take care of, without the help of their dad.  (I don't mean this to sound too negative on my dad-- he's a human, and made mistakes like everyone else.  His mistakes did cost us, but I've forgiven him a long time ago).    For a very brief time, my mother & I were what one would call homeless.  They didn't have that word back then, though.  This was in Louisiana, and on the kindness of a woman my mother met, we got some shelter.  We were in a tiny shrimping town where there was a long main street with more bars than anything else, a few churches, and a school.  I've seen pictures online of the city, and it still looks just about the same, many years later.    The place we ended up living was a gay bar, really a disco.  It was a big wooden building painted a hideous shade of lime green with a big shell gravel parking lot in front. Let me tell you, it was not easy being picked up by the school bus in that place, that all the kids knew about.  It was kind of on the edge of town-- they would play  urlLink booray  in the day time (a sort of card game big in La) and at night the place was packed with drag queens and party-people.  But honestly, it was a pretty normal bar-- I know, cause I got to see a couple of times when we peeked at night.  I think, despite what the kids on the school bus thought, it was probably the hippest place in town, and I suspect a lot more than gay folks came there to get their party on.    In the back of the bar there were these living quarters-- it had a living room, kitchen, bathroom and a small bedroom area.  It was all closed up, but we could open these two big doors to see the dance floor of the bar.  I sometimes tell people of my age that I learned the  urlLink YMCA  before any of you because I learned it the first time around, in the " urlLink Studio 54 " days of the late 70s early 80s.  Yup.  I'm cool like that.*   I have a short fiction story based on my life there, that you can read  urlLink here .  It's not  urlLink War & Peace,  but it's kind of fun. My mom used to bring me Coca-Colas with lots of  urlLink maraschino cherries  in them.    I think this is partly where my sense of people just being people comes from.  One of my mother's friends, Donny, was a bisexual man who liked to dress up as a woman (a drag queen).  He was gorgeous, in a tight black velvet pant suit and puffy Dolly Parton-esque blonde wig, long red fingernails, silver jewelry and high heels.  Donny used to go sit in truck driver bars in the middle of hicksville La and get truckers to buy him drinks all day.  Now that I'm older and know how incredibly dangerous that was for him I'm even more amazed, but he never, as far as I know, was beat up or anything.  I don't know if this is a testament to his skill at convincing those truckers he was a woman, or that perhaps more of them were amenable to "difference" than one would think.    They used to let kids into these places as long as you were with a parent.  I liked to play pinball and the jukebox and I remember being in one of those bars playing pinball for hours and listening to Tanya Tucker's " urlLink Texas "** and  urlLink New Orleans Ladies  on the Jukebox.  People used to give me quarters to play songs (back then, you could get a bunch of them from just a quarter).  I think cause they felt some sort of strange pity for this little stringy haired kid in a bar and thought somehow a few songs or pinball games would make it better.  But really, that was one of the fun parts of my childhood.  It's not nearly as weird as you might think.  Those bars used to be dark, and smoky, and there were always these jars of translucent, somehow eerily green-glowing  urlLink pickled quails' eggs  on them.  Now that I think about it, I'm not sure why all the bars had to have these-- I think it goes back to pub food, and a historical sense that places like that ought to have something like this kind of food.    Donny married a bi woman, and once, when my sister came to town, both of them hit on her.  So that's sort of funny, but it's just one of those things.  My mother used to call bisexuals " urlLink AC/DC " like "alternating and direct current."  (Not the  urlLink band , man.  The electrical stuff).  I like that idea, actually.  Because it's a wiring thing-- it doesn't say one particular kind of electric wiring is superior or inferior; it's just different.  Because I think our sexuality is something we're born with, the idea of "wiring" makes sense in a way that a lot of people just don't get.  Your walls don't choose to be either/or-- they are wired that way.  And you can't convert your AC wiring to DC by telling it to just be different.    The moral of this story is that people, no matter where they live or who they are, mostly just want to live their lives as best as they can.  It may not be the same way that you yourself live, but that doesn't mean it's evil, or will corrupt children.  I grew up as normal as anyone else-- have a stable marriage and lots of ambition-- living in what pundits call an alternative culture did not change me for the worse.  And unlike a lot of people might think, I was a very conservative kid (waited till very late in the game for my first boyfriend, and married the second "serious" boyfriend I ever had).    But man, does it make for some interesting stories.  While folks from middle-class suburban upbringing were growing up with birthday parties, clowns, trips to Chuck-e-cheese and stuff, my life was a bit of a soap opera.  I'll tell you more about it sometime, if you wanna hear some other good stories.  But that's probably enough about me for today.    ----------- *I have a "list" on amazon.com that talks about this a bit more from a funny perspective, called " urlLink So You Want to be a Drag Queen Trapped in a Woman's Body ."  If you go there to see it, vote for me and get me on the top 100 listmania listers.   ----------- **It's sort of funny that I ended up in Texas, and I agree with the lyrics of that song in many ways.  When I first met my Texan husband, I always told him he looked like a cowboy (he kinda does.)

      Okay, I know she's not actually IN prison.  Despite all those stupid pictures that were going around about how she would decorate her cell (which were designed by someone with NO IDEA about  urlLink Martha , because they were WAAAAY too tacky for her cell decor.  It would be something tasteful, perhaps with some Shaker furniture, with a lot of sea foam green, thank you very much).  But I think she is innocent of the charges against her, and it is ridiculous that her career is in jeopardy because she took her broker's advice.  People say "it's the cover up that gets you."  What, exactly, did she cover up?  A murder?  An invasion on shaky evidence?  Or perhaps illicit adulterous sex while on the job?  Who was seriously harmed by Martha's actions?  Yeah.  That's what I thought you'd say.  I've thought all along that the case against Martha Stewart was being driven   1. by a desire to make an example of a famous person  2. because people dislike her for no really good reason  3. because she's a powerful woman (dare I say it, even, at times, a bitch?)    I heard on the news that courtroom sketch artists were having a hard time drawing her because she has no "distinguishing features."  How about that hair, man?  That's good.  And the self-assured tilt of her eyebrows.  The pictures I've seen are definitely unattractive, and unflattering.  These people are supposed to be artists, yet they can't even get a woman who has been a public icon for years face right?  Puh-leeze.  The lack of good courtroom sketches is, in my humble opinion, just another low blow against a woman who has really done no one any real harm, and a lot of people some real good.    So to get your news fix on this issue, here are some web links:  There's a  urlLink nice blog  dedicated to her courtoom proceedings that I checked out.  Then there's  urlLink Slate's guide to the trial,  with fabulous headlines like:  "Back-Room Deals and Heads on Platters."  Martha herself keeps you posted with her official stand at  urlLink Marthatalks.com   What I think is going on is that people who haven't ever liked Martha and all that they think she stands for (an upper middle class sort of WASP-ish ness) want to punish her for her status as a woman who deals in the domestic.  Even though in reality, her style is NOT about demanding perfection, but demanding, instead, that one simply take pleasure in things like a home-made whipped cream (which I tell you, really is better than the stuff in the plastic tub).  To take some time to bake a cake from scratch, when you can.  To try to make your home a pleasant place.  It ISN'T about keeping women stuck in the 1950s, as I've heard some people say.  It's not about a return to the Home Ec sheet on what a  urlLink good wife should do for her hubby .    If you can't do it, or don't want to-- hey.  That's fine with her, and with me, and any other domestic goddess type.  But I don't hate people who DON'T want to cook and throw dinner parties-- why do you hate folks like me because we enjoy it?  It's not anti-feminist, to be a domestic diva.  No one is saying that you're bad if you don't do domestic stuff, or that it should be your only choice as a woman-- being in the home.  But it ought to be one of your choices-- and the belief that someone is "just a housewife" is inaccurate and spiteful.  ALL women's roles should be respected and validated.  Not just the ones the media recommends, but the ones you personally wish to play.  The attitude of "burn Martha" is terribly scary and part of an anti-powerful woman backlash that has been going on in this country for a long time.  I've heard non-domestic types say they "hate her".  Why?  Because you can't live up to your own personal standards? Well neither can I-- but she doesn't expect you to.  It's about trying what you can-- not doing everything.  I can NOT do all of the things Martha does-- I do not have my own staff, thank you.  But some of her  urlLink recipes  and tips are wonderful, and her type of influence is exactly one of the reasons why people who once rejected everything domestic as oppressive and retrograde are instead thinking of how to make easy home-made meals, instead of popping off to the dreaded McD's again.  No one who is a Martha Stewart fan thinks less of you if you can't do a quiche, or get your souffles to rise.  But her skills are in things that HAVE been traditionally thought of as women's domain-- and people hate her because she says it's important to pay attention to these little things again.  It's not about NOT working outside the home-- but about making your home a home.    It is precisely a double standard, and as  urlLink one website  put it, "I get e-mails all the time from men who want to turn the clock back to colonial times. ... They call her a witch, they seem to say she's guilty before a trial. ... They seem to be very angry at her and at us for defending her."  Yes.  Martha's trial is definitely a witch hunt, of the worst sort.  People want to see her "burn" for all the same reasons they like to see powerful women kept in their place.   In a country where wife-murderers play golf, and the Enron execs are out sailing yachts and drinking Cristal, Martha risks jail time for a monetary exchange that was, for her, the equivalent of me giving you ten bucks.  It's a vicious sort of petty spite against a woman for reasons unclear to me.  It's not about seeing justice done, because frankly, if justice really were a consideration in this, there wouldn't have been a trial at all.    If Martha Stewart serves jail time for this, I would have to say that we have lost our way and that the world is really screwed up beyond repair.

      My office is on the "outside wall" next to the front porch.  So whenever I get a delivery (which is fairly often, since I order  urlLink special snob coffee  almost every three weeks or so) the UPS guy sort of stomps on the porch, (which is my first clue that something is  about to happen ) then rings the doorbell rapidly twice,* drops my package like a hot potato, and sprints back to his truck with a speed that would make  urlLink Donovan Bailey  (fastest man in the world) go "Wow.  Dude.  Slow it Down Some." (I'm assuming.  I didn't actually ask Mr. Bailey what he thought).    By the time I get over the sudden adrenaline rush from an unexpected doorbell at almost 6 pm on a dark and rainy night, rush to the front room, and open the door, the UPS guy is a butt in brown pants leaping into the truck like some sort of brown  urlLink leaping  thing.  (I couldn't think of a good simile.  Sue me.  And I know the link is to a green jumping thing.  We can't all be perfect.)  The funny (ha ha)  thing is that the last package had a "signature required" label on it.  Did he get my signature? No.  Not unless someone's been giving me memory wipes again.  (Damn  urlLink CIA ).    So offically, I am  not  in crush/love/lust with the  urlLink UPS  guy.  He gives me the willies cause he just sprints away like that.  He also makes me feel bad, like the unattractive old  urlLink landlady  in  Kingpin  that Woody Harrleson's character had to sleep with for his rent money. (who is actually pretty attractive in her publicity photo).  Am I so hideous that the UPS man has to race away from my door before I can even make it the 12 feet down the hall and back to answer his doorbell?  I realize he's in a hurry, but man, I'm not an ogre!    Why, oh why, am I so frightening to the UPS man?   I just wanna be loved, is that so wrong?!  *causing me to yell "darn you kids: stop ringing that bell!!"  while shaking my fist at them, even though there actually are no kids and I'm hallucinating again....

      Well, I went to the AAFA exam on Friday. It was a very long day-- I got up at 3 AM and was going, including exercising a bit, till about 11 pm. I think I passed the written portion of the exam with flying colors (pink & black, if you must know) but some of the things on the "practical" where you have to demonstrate a class & several types of exercise, well, I dunno. We'll see. It depends on how strict the judges were. What was hard is that you had to have good form on the exercises but there were no mirrors to check yourself with. So it beats the heck outa me.  In the meantime, the weekend was swell-- visited Andrew in Shreveport and had several nice meals with him & his parents. Discovered again that I don't care at all for Casinos. The cat was fine when I got home, and she's spent a while meowing earnestly at me-- she had a lot to tell me, apparently.    In further news-- I read a really good book on the plane. It's called   urlLink Solitaire   by Kelley Eskridge.  I have read work by Eskridge's partner,  urlLink Nicola Griffith , and really loved it-- I recommend her too. They both deal with lesbian relationships really well; I know Griffith has won at least one  urlLink Lambda  award. Basically, it's not "extra" that often the protagonists are women who love women-- it's treated as a normal part of the narrative, as it should be, as it would be if it was a hetero relationship. But it's not really the focus of the text-- it's just a part of the person's life in the story. They're both sort of sci-fi. I say sort of because it's the type of sci fi that's thoughtful (a lot of it is!) but not really about deep space exploration or robots or something. It's basically speculative reality. So, if you're into books that explore the nature of social relationships at the same time as they sort of make you think about people, but also have an edge, try both writers. Solitiare put me in a very contemplative, sort of sad mood for a while, in a good way, but it's strong, vibrant prose and I really cannot praise her work (or Griffith's to that matter) enough. I just noticed when I looked up the amazon link that Griffith has a book I haven't read-- so I'm going to have to get that one. With my limited time for "fun reading" it's really great to find writers who I know I'll like, who I know will make me think.  If you go to the link on the Lambdas, I've also read  urlLink The Gumshoe, The Witch and the Virtual Corpse  by Keith Hartman.  That one's fabulous too-- it's got this really cool bit on witches.  :)

      Okay, so THIS weekend I'm going out of town for sure. Tomorrow is the big AAFA aerobics certification day.  I will have a verrrrry lonnnnng day, getting to the airport at 5 am, then to Dallas for Aerobic workshop/test.  Then tomorrow night to Shreveport till Monday.  A little canoodling with the hubby.  So wish me luck on my test tomorrow.  Just remember "purpose, effectiveness, alignment/form, for whom is this exercise"?  That's my mnemonic of the night.  I'm singing it.    And I have many, many personalities.  This weekend, as you see, I'm "sporty."  :)

      She comes into the room, disapproval radiating from every inch.    "Are you on blogs again?  You should be working out/cleaning the house/working on your dissertation!"    I quickly attempt to minimize the screen to hide my illicit "keeping-up-with-complete-strangers" from her eagle-sharp eyes, but I am not quick enough.  My lame attempts at defense fall on deaf ears and she demands that I move along and do something productive, something that will forward my career, and/or make me a healthier individual in a clean house.  It doesn't matter that I point out that most people read blogs while at work, earning real money and having signed a contract to do a certain JOB.  She says, "Um, yeah, I'm gonna have to ask you to remember that you are not, after all, a character in the movie  urlLink Office Space ," and then says that admitting that I do a good 2 hours of work a week is not at all okay because it's only my own future I'm railroading.  (I hate that "I'm not mad at you; I'm disappointed in you" crap).    All of my arguments are really for nothing because everything I say she counters with a truly good point.  She's really hard to argue with.  Even pointing out that a minimum of 69 people found my webblog story on the superbowl, and that they truly were pointed in the direction of a thought-provoking gender-awakening style argument rather than just the salacious pictures they were looking for doesn't hold any weight with her.  She's not having any of it. Instead, she points out that others were looking for photos of Posh Spice in formal wear (and no, I don't know why they made it here, either.  But wouldn't pictures of Posh Spice in formal wear be nifty?  Go ahead.  Go  urlLink search for them ).  So I reluctantly shut the computer down to go to my office (otherwise known as Starbucks @ the Forum) to get some real writing done, away from the computer's siren call of the Internet.  I also promise to not chat with nice single guys who I would like to set up with my single friends.    I deeply regret the day I took  urlLink that cat  to debate classes.  She took to argument like you wouldn't believe, and now she's just impossible to reason and/or live with.  I really liked her better when she just brought me lizards.

      Why did it take me three tries to spell sphere?    Okay.  Anyway.  Those of you who know me outside of bloggerland know that a while back I changed my email address because, what with the online presence at  urlLink womenwriters , I was getting SO much spam.  I downloaded email one day (and it hadn't been that long since the last download) and got something like 150 emails-- 2 of which I actually wanted to get.  So the addy changed.  It's a big step, changing the email address.  It's worse, really, than changing your phone number because in this modern email based world we live, there are folks who we don't talk to all that often who are "email correspondents" who will not get the message, and somehow be lost in the world of email bounce.  They may not be the closest friends, but I like keeping up with them.    Not to mention the email I accidentally lost when I deleted the "kim" address-- I didn't mean to delete them all, but there were about 500 messages in the folder and in trying to get rid, quickly, of the bulk of junk, I deleted everything.  Probably most of that was junk.  But there were most likely a few letters in there from people who now think I'm a total tool for not writing back, and are as we speak undoubtedly creating little voodoo dolls of me with a crashing computer and/or nasty rash on my arms.  Just for that oh-so-important internet revenge.  I would beg for mercy, but in deleting all those emails, I probably don't deserve it.  It's karma, I know.   But ultimately, the loss was worth it for the almost year long (maybe that long?) respite I had from spam.  It was really, really nice to open up my "inbox" and find that I didn't have dozens of letters about Viagra, or one of those Hilton chicks, or from that guy who really wants me to help him transfer some money, and will reward me handsomely for my bank account number.    But alas, there is much gnashing of teeth and rending of clothes.  Today will go down as a red-letter email day.    Today, my friends, I realized that once again, my new address is in the "spam-o-sphere."  I got one of those "bounces" from the virus protector of someone I don't even know, with my "cloned" email address as the source.  That means that I'm in the virus list now-- no more freedom from the evil spam empire.  It won't be long till I'm on on those damn lists again.  And the meager protections of spam lists in our email programs are not worth really even mentioning.  ::sigh::  I re-iterate a wish I have made before, wholeheartedly.  I wish that deliberate spammers & virus creators be consigned to a special version of Hell, where they sit (in a non-ergonomically kind chair) at a computer (preferably installed with an OS that crashes every three seconds) and have to weed through millions upon millions of spam emails to find the ONE email that, if they found it, would entitle them to a second chance.  And every time they open an email, they get, oh, let's say 7 more which pop up, messing up the list and making them start back at the top again.  AND their "cupholder" will be broken, too.    That sort of punishment, my friends, would indeed prove that there is a God, and she is wise.

      I am beginning to be suspicious that people put weird search strings into google and then click every site that comes up just to make people like me wonder WTF!? about the terms people are looking for.  How else do you explain that someone found my site yesterday using the search phrase:  "cat home hulk love butt zoo love butt"?!!  What in GOD's NAME was that person looking for unless they're doing the "conspiracy theory" above?    I really don't want to know.  Plus, I know for a fact that until just this moment, the word Hulk could not have appeared in this blog because I HATED that movie.  (I know, you gotta be one of those film geeks to get it-- well, I'm not).    I think it's something people must do for fun.  Sort of like when I signed up for my access to a graphics site, I listed my profession as astrophysicist, cause it was an option, and I figured "hey, man, that'll screw with their stats."  So, that's gotta be it.  (I really don't want to imagine the world where someone wants to find a webpage devoted to  urlLink cat home hulk love butt zoo love butt ).

      I really don't have any particular thing to say this morning except that I'm feeling crabby, as my unkymood shows.  I think it's sad that my cat can have such a radical effect on my mood, but after waking me up too early, she's very smelly, her litter box is "broken" (I have one of those "automated" rake-things) and she won't eat the food I gave her and is whining at me about it.  With Andrew gone, she's the only "contact" I get unless I go somewhere, so imagine if the other person you lived with woke up this morning giving you MAJOR attitude.  It's really cute when cats are annoying in those cat comic strips like, say,  urlLink Get Fuzzy .  But it's totally different when she's your housemate.    Piffle.    I hope my kick-ass workout will help.  It's at 11:00, and my instructor is this really wild and energetic flight-attendant chick.  Normally, I leave the class really well exercised and feeling much better.  The universe better hope I do that today, or else I can't be sure of the consequences of my crankiness.

      I'm going to weigh in here with my humble, nobody asked for it opinion on the Janet & Justin boobygate Superbowl scandal.  Based on photos I saw on Fox urlLink  Sports  it really looks to me like yes, they did mean to pull off the top layer of Janet's bustier/leather thing and expose the red bra underneath.  But I think Justin gripped a bit too much fabric & we got the "whole enchilada" -- so to speak.  The look on Justin's face in one of the still photos I saw says "Holy Crap!"   (See picture number 10 in the sequence there).  And Janet doesn't look pleased at all, either.  So, I do think they intended a bit of "drama" there at the end, but not quite as much as they got.  Picture 5 is that looking-down, realizing you're "out" moment that all women have probably had at some point (at the beach with me, with waves a little more wavey than I thought).    OOOH there's gonna be some scandal, and some red-faced embarrassment.  As CBS said:  MTV won't be doing another halftime show.  Well, there were parts of this one that were the best I've seen in a while, but the entire Jackson bit was a bit odd-- sort of like a cross between  urlLink Les Mis  and  urlLink A Clockwork Orange  with a little  urlLink Cirque du Soleil  thrown in there in the costume department.  I guess the thing they forgot is that the Superbowl is not quite the MTV movie awards and/or even the Grammies.  A little more conservative there fellas.    But still.  I gotta give my man Justin props-- I don't think he meant to do it, and he's the only person I've seen statements from other than the official "CBS" statement.  (How do you like the "street cred" I get there with my oh so cool lingo?)  I know.  I'm so cool.  Everyone seems to assume it was not an accident.  I don't think the main part with the bare booby was on purpose.  Yes, she had something that looked like a pasty there-- I think it was the normal earrings she has in her breasts.  Janet IS a bit of a strange one, in some ways, but it doesn't look like a pasty so much as metal-- jewelry that stays put.    Finally, what I want to say about this is that I think it's actually sort of funny (in a not funny way) that we get offended by the sight of a woman's breast on TV.  Yes, if it was on purpose and using sex to sell and objectification and all that, fine, that's wrong.    But I personally am much more offended when I see some bigshot action hero blow someone's head off on TV, and there's no public outcry and no quick cutaway.  Why isn't anyone talking about the guys grabbing crotch every three seconds like they were afraid it would disappear if they didn't check on it?    One of the things I discovered in New Orleans when people were "flashing for beads" is that bared breasts are much less threatening feeling than bared male anatomy.  Some guys, in trying to get our beads, would offer to unzip.  And that was just creepy, where the breast flashing was different, and less weird, and after a while, it wasn't even all that shocking.  But there's a power differential there, where a guy bares the "package" it feels more like a threat than a peep show.  Why is it that CBS has to apologize for an accidental breast peek and the news says about the nearly naked streaker "a streaker running onto the field just before the start of the third quarter certainly was entertaining."?  So what  was  with all that crotch grabbing?       UPDATE :  You know, the more I think about it, the more disturbed I am by this whole incident.   urlLink Feministe  has a good take on the incident that brings up some points I hadn't thought of.  In reading her post, I have changed my mind about how I feel.  I was just basically thinking of it as a "freedoms" issue-- but even IF there hadn't been the "wardrobe malfunction," even giving them the benefit of the doubt that they didn't MEAN to expose her whole breast, it was a violent display of a woman being exposed for "titillation" of an unsuspecting audience.  Bleah.  I'm just mad at everyone today, and now I realize why that whole halftime show got under my skin.     Update 2   There's now an official " urlLink apology " from Janet's side of the camp, and I am right that they didn't mean it to go so far.  But I do still think that the fact they thought it would be "cute" to simulate a sexual assault of sorts shows how toxic our culture's attitude about sex is.

      Well, part of my incentive for getting a good-sized draft of the dissertation done is that Andrew (AKA wonderhusband) has promised that we can take a cool cruise in the early summer IF I get a draft (at least) done. (And it is looking pretty good so far).   One of the cruises that we are seriously considering are a couple of different "Clipper Ships Tours" of the Mediterranean.  So since I can already mangle my way through French & Spanish, I'm seriously thinking of getting the "Italian in your car" series so I can speak little bits of Italian.  Some of them have overnights in, say, Monte Carlo.  Cool, huh?  And I could wander about, amazing the natives with my fabulous grasp of, "excuse me, where are the bathrooms?" and "I have a pencil" or "where do I purchase a train ticket?"  And, of course, the best part of all is I can ask those wonderful three phrases (and much, much more) in FOUR languages, instead of my mere three now (I'm including my native English.  Cause clearly I have mastered that one.  AND I do have a pencil.)    So if anyone reading this blog has had experience on the Clipper Ships, (WindStar or "Star Clippers") I'd love to hear your review.  They're really not much more expensive than the "Big Giant CRUISE SHIPS" that I've looked at, yet it looks much more intimate & luxurious.  And it's got the added appeal that we might end up swabbing the decks, matey, and/or press-ganged into the Privateer business.  I like it that the Frommer's guide emphasizes that there's a cool library on board, and several times within the description mentioned "reading" and/or "curling up with a good book."  It sounds heavenly-- much better than the idea of playing bingo with the "cruise" version of our parents.  (No Bingo For ME!!)

      *What Would Buffy Do?  I just did a kickboxing workout that made me feel like Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  Yeah!  It was sort of short, and I didn't get too sweaty-- next time I'll add some jogging too.  But I put it off too long today, so I don't have time for the jog.  (Well.  I would if I weren't going out to socialize..... but still.)    But this workout was a fun kickbox-- and there was something about it.  Maybe because the leader of the class looks a tiny bit like Sarah Jessica Parker-- petite, blonde.  I am actually still sore from my Monday kickboxing class, so I know tomorrow I'm going to be complaining.  I can feel it already in my right arm, and my left leg's hamstrings.  (Not too bad, but just a little fatigued).  OOOOH Rah! (As the Marines would say).    If you decide you need to get this workout, do the SECOND one.   urlLink Kick Butt 2 .  The first one is sort of lame-- with bad cues, and while the boxer who led the class is certainly in good shape, it was a weird workout.  But the second was cool.

      Okay.  Again with the comment thing.  My old comment system seemed really slow, and I wonder if that's why YA'LL NEVER COMMENT!!!!!!!  Any comment made since the last day on this main page are gone, cause the code thingy wiped them when I changed systems.  But it's not like there were a bunch of them.  Noone loves me, obviously.    Sorry for that outburst.  But now, with the new and improved comment system, you can also comment & I can get "trackbacks" if people comment on my blog.    So get out there and say something about me.  Other blogs have, like,  urlLink hundreds of comments .  Do I need to ply you all with liquor or something to get you moving?    (This rant does not, by the way, apply to " urlLink the other Kim " who comments faithfully and is my only true friend.  Apparently.)

      Yesterday, when I got home after being gone since last Thursday, and more importantly, after the house had been closed up since my friend K. left on Friday night, I was walking around and noticed a little bird flying panicky-like in the living room.  It was smacking up against the windows in there with beak open in fear, panting and wide-eyed, trying, I imagine, to get out.  (Either that or he hated the curtain treatment and was trying to offer some not-so-subtle hints that I need a new decorator).    I thought maybe I had let it in when I opened the back door to let the cat out for her after-drive stretch.  I opened other doors, and coaxed said little bird out the front door where he escaped with a flick of the tail and a "later loser" before heading off into the wild blue yonder.  But then, I looked around and saw bird poo and a  few feathers scattered about the floor where the cat's dish is.  And then a few bits of bird poo on the dining room table (an antique-- although it's finish is already a bit toasted so it's not too bad of a deal-- anyone know how to re-finish tables?)  And then, as the evening wound on, I found smatterings of little birdy poo on my shower curtain, too.  I imagine I'll find a few other little splats here and there.  Does bird poo carry any major, blood-spurting-out-of-my-eyes-in-a-horrible-death-diseases?  I'm cleaning it with 409-- should I get a biohazard suit?    Apparently, little birdy had been trapped alone in the house while I was gone for at least four days.  Poor little thing!  I just hope it didn't order any pay-per-view porn while it was here.  It would be really embarassing for that to show up on the bill next month.     *I'm not sure if this was the "fabulous" blog entry I had planned.  But it'll do for now.  Now, after having performed the Yoga Sun Salute, and updating you folks on your "need to know stuff about me" fix, I need to go to Starbuck's and get coffee since there's NO MILK in the fridge.  Damn that butler.  It's really hard getting good help these days.  They keep pissing off to do their own things and not anticipating my every whim.  (No.  I don't really have a butler. That's a stupid joke).

      Er, yes, camels.  Outside of Waco there was this ranch on the side of the road, with grazing black-and-white cows and at least three camels roaming about the fenced-in enclosure.  Camels.  What would they be doing round these parts?  Other than novelty value?  Of course, I may have already mentioned, there's also a museum to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre just outside of Waco.  So.  The highway is full of interesting sites OTHER THAN Starbuck's (of which there are quite a few on the Texas side of the border).    Bulimia kitty did great on her road trip.  She has a new kitty carrying gadget that keeps her safe, and she stayed in it most of the time.  I guess the last time she got sick in the car had something to do with the old Nissan.  She seems to like the purry new Mitsubishi just fine. Maybe she's a sports car fan, and just doesn't get into four door family mobiles.    I'm home, and going to spend tonight with one more day of lollygagging and then back to work tomorrow.  I have written on the dissertation (at least 7 more pages added) but will not update the witchy counter yet.  Tomorrow is another day. And this is ALMOST the last of the disappearing acts, since soon Andrew will be gloriously home (late April). It both feels like some kind of withdrawal and kind of nice to go without computer/Internet access while away.

      Well, we'll see later today if I'm a complete idiot or not.  (Hush.  I don't need any giggles from some of you!)  I'm taking Tituba on a 7 hour road trip to Shreveport, so Andrew can see our new car & we can spend the weekend together without me feeling guilty about leaving the cat alone AGAIN.  We did a "test run" yesterday and she was fine.  In the old car, she got carsick, but it was ALMOST as soon as the car started moving.  In the distant past, she was fine driving (we drove all the way from Seattle to Texas with her and no problems-- well, aside from major whining on her part about being in the car, at 2 am, while we were driving.... but that's not car sick, just typical Tituba).    I also have a good book on tape-- the new Margaret Atwood.  Fun and games for everyone kids!    I'm going to try to keep up with the blog while there, because there is one computer I might be able to use.  We'll see.  I wish you could write blogs and have them automatically load-- then you guys'd never know I left.  Sort of like in LA Story where he films the weather for the weekend early, and gets fired cause it rains.  (But then, gets the girl cause of it).    Later dudes.  Just keep swimming.

      I needed a new garbage can for my kitchen today since my father-in-law, while feeding the cat, did something weird to the old one and succeeded in breaking it.  So I went out to the local "bed & bath" store & a couple of other places.  Did you know that you can buy a garbage can, one that looks just about like the one I bought for 40 bucks* (which was my top limit on garbage cans-- it's fancy & stainless steel) for 187 dollars!?!  Seriously.  Almost 200 dollars for a can in which you put your leftover banana peels, dirty paper towels, cat food cans & coffee grinds.    Tell me-- who is it in the world who can pay 200 bucks for a garbage can, and more importantly, will they adopt me?     *which I realize is actually a pretty extravagant price for a can, in itself, but it sits prominently in my kitchen & people come over all the time & see it, and I don't want a dirty stained plastic one, and I'm not good at keeping the plastic ones from NOT getting stained.  So about that much was what I intended to spend, since the last one I bought lasted several years at around that price.

      I also have edited several pages of the intro to the dissertation, so I would probably, were photoshop available to me, have to add three or four pages to the dissertation count.  I know that's not much, but hey, I gotta socialize, don't I?      **UPDATE** and I totally forgot to mention that, while at Einstein Bros, I saw AZ Barbie in the flesh!  A very pretty, blond, tan girl with straight hair (no frizzies!), a cute outfit along with high heeled (platform) sandles, and a spotted hair scarf.  I really wanted to tell her she looked JUST LIKE BARBIE but wasn't sure how that would go over.  Unlike Barbie, she did not have a permanent smile, and I was afraid that without the smile, she might just not like my comment.  But oh, Barbie.  I wanted to braid your hair and maybe even have you drive your pink corvette over to Ken's house for pizza.

      This morning, I rode a spiffy RED bike, with those old fashioned handlebars (complete with a little bell & horn) down the road to Einstein Brothers' bagels.  I had a helmet on, and a purple backpack full of my "homework."  So instead of the fourteen I was in buying condoms a week or two ago, I am  now approximately eleven.  But all the grown ups were at work, and I didn't have a car (nor actually want one) available, and was jonesing for sugar and caffeine.  It was fun.  My back, however, is still a bit sweaty.  I wonder if, like small boys who are out playing in the yard, I smell like a wet dog.  That would be unfortunate, really.  Tomorrow, I go home.  As long as the airline cooperates and lets me get on a plane (I fly Space Available-- and this weekend, there was negative Space A).  I am anxious to do so, since my poor kitty has been lonely.  Poor thing.    And today-- bellydancing costume playing! WOOOOOOH!    Oh, and I forgot to mention yesterday's mountain climbing and swimming pool visit.  Altogether, an active weekend.  Phoenix, despite its  heat, has a lot more outdoor activities than San Antonio.  No wonder SA gets "most unfit" city all the time.  There's nothing to do outside there, other than walk on the river, and no one but tourists and those locals dragging the tourists around to the Alamo & stuff go there.   Anyhoo.  Maybe more later.  But as you can see, I'm quite busy.  I may have to, in the spirit of my eleven year old self, go chew some really smelly bubble gum later.

      I've been trying to learn to sew since I started bellydancing.  I can sew harem pants-- they're really easy-- you just sew two tubes of cloth together & put elastic in three places (legs, waist).  But the other stuff, like cute little choli tops & tank, have eluded me.  Today, I remembered that friend JJ who I'm visiting (till Tuesday, it turns out, since all the flights are booked out of Phoenix.  Spring Break-- who knew?)  is a great seamstress-type.  So we went and got this cool pattern, and we're going to make it for me in black & gold.   I was trying to find it online to show it to you but couldn't.  Anyway.  Trust me-- it's cool.  And so is JJ.  Yay!    More later.  Now I have to go do sewing domestic stuff.

      Did you know that keeping up with a two year old is exhausting?  I didn't till my visit here to Phoenix.  We've done lots of stuff-- park playing, which included me holding said two year old over my head so she could "do the monkey bars" for much longer than I initially intended.  Good thing I've been doing my military presses.    While at the park, there was this guy who is running for office looking for people to sign his petition to get himself on the ballot.  Not being from AZ, I wasn't qualified to participate.  The man was quite nice, looking around and all he wanted was people to let him on the ballot.  A signature wasn't going to get him elected.  There was this one chick who asked (as I did too) what party he was with.  When he wasn't with the party she apparently supported, she refused to sign his petition.  I thought that was just lame.  We all need diversity on the ballot-- the more candidates, the better.   And the thing is, just because someone is not in your party does NOT mean they don't share your views.  For me, for example, I registered my party when I was 18 and didn't actually know the difference between them.  Now that I do know the difference, and don't really fit in either party, I stay registered the way I am, although I frequently disagree with some of the things my party does, because I feel there's a certain amount of power I have over the things I don't like this way.  I can say "I am a member of X party and I don't like what you did."  (No, I'm not telling you which party I'm in.  It would spoil the surprise.)    Anyway.  Thus the world traveler me learns new things.  Parks are hard work.  Mommies are sometimes mean to politicians.  And the coffee making guy at the Coffee Plantation somewhere in Phoenix looks just like Jordan Catalano.  (Extra brownie points for those who know who the heck I mean by that obscure reference.)    More later.  Now my slave-driving friend wants me to teach her how to save photos to a CD.  Work, work, work.

      I'm in Phoenix, at my friend JJ's house visiting.  The airplane ride was icky.  I got up this morning at 3:30 AM (yes, I said AM).  Funnily enough, I didn't go to sleep till, like, midnight at the earliest, and then the cat started puking.  Gotta love those pets, right?  I have some stuff I wrote while at the airport, but I'm sneaking into writing this while JJ is out of the room, so I'll have to do that later.  She wants me to help her with some tech writing projects.  Pfffhht.  But then, there will be much rejoicing.  (Maybe).    But I never really thought I'd complain that someplace was hotter than Texas.  So I won't do it here.  But it's so hot (how hot is it?) that ::insert funny joke here::.  Hey.  Don't complain that I made you come up with your own joke.  I got up at 3:30 am this morning.  My wit has left the building.  (Maybe I left it in Dallas.)

      So I danced at the restaurant-- it was fun, but most of the class of students who were supposed to also dance didn't do it.  One lady was very brave and did a good job; she even had a fun basic beginner costume with scarves & fun colors (go figure, the lady with lots of cool dragon tattoos would be brave).  Everyone else, for the most part, did not dance (a few did for a very short time but ran off the second the instructor left to talk to someone).  I was left all alone.  But I think I did really well-- apparently, according to some ladies who were there and were at my bellydance class tonight, too well.  Why?  Someone's husband was "asking about me" they said.  And they said this right after this other lady randomly was talking about strippers.  So, what was it about the one lady's comment on strippers that made them think "oh yes, and this guy was asking about YOU?"  No biggie.  Early strippers stole a lot of their moves from bellydance-- the "hoochie coochie" is largely a rip off of middle eastern dance.    That's why a lot of aficionados of bellydance call it "middle eastern dance" cause people have in their minds the perception that the two are closely linked.  No.  No.  No.  They really are not.  Those dancers who make it so (by dancing a little too raunchily) are the exception.  Most bellydancers are in to it because of the heritage of a woman's dance-- it's a pagan, hippie sort of thing.  Fat Chance Belly dance of San Francisco evokes a woman's power ideal with their dance.    Anyway.  I love it.  It works the abs really well, and it's more akin to yoga than aerobics, but you do work up a sweat when performing.  And it has definitely made me more graceful in the two years since I've been doing it.  And, being a drag queen trapped in a woman's body as I am, I truly enjoy the costume elements.    Tomorrow, I'm flying to visit an old friend in Phoenix.   I get to meet her hubby who I've not met since he's been a hubby & not just a cute neighbor, and her baby.  (It's been a while since I've seen her).  But I should have internet access while there so don't fret-- I'll write while in the 90 something temps.  ::shudder::  90s!  In March!  EEEK!  We get that high in Texas, of course, but not till late May, early June.  Tonight it's 66, and today it probably got up to the low 80s, with a cool breeze making it seem much lower.  But enough about the weather.  Wave to me if I'm flying over your home between Dallas & Phoenix.  I'm sure I'll see and wave back.

      I'm not a big gambler.  When I went to Las Vegas, the thing I liked about it was the "shows"-- I didn't really have fun throwing quarters into slot machines for no real reason and/or reward.  So this is probably the reason why I noticed, when there was this show on casinos on TV, that in the discussion of the  urlLink Atlantis  resort casino*, there was a short moment where you saw this big, golden calf standing in the casino.  Yes that's right.   urlLink A golden calf .

      I'm a genius.  I've figured it out for sure.  Millions of folks are hoping and wishing that they could lose weight, and are struggling with the  urlLink Atkins  Diet, the  urlLink Zone ,  urlLink Sugar Busters -- etc.  What could really help us as a nation lose weight?  Well.  I have the answer to several social problems, all in one!  It costs the American taxpayer millions of dollars to house  urlLink violent criminals  in our prison system.  Perhaps we could set up a plan where your basic ax murderer would be paid a small fee to come over and chase people around for a minimum of thirty minutes a day, people who want to burn more calories and thus lose weight (thirty minutes is the recommendation for daily aerobic activity).  They could start off being the fairly out of shape ax murderers that you could easily outrun, and as your aerobic conditioning got better, you would graduate to a more fit ax murderer, giving you the intensity of workout that grows with you.  They could also hang around and watch us during those weak moments when we are tempted to eat the entire gallon of ice cream in the fridge; if you eat the ice cream, they pull out the ax and chase you around.  Weakened by too much cream and sugar and sweet tasty vanilla or chocolate, you would learn that too much ice cream IS hazardous to your health.  No more cheating on diets!    The fear of immediate and terrible death would be a much more powerful motivator than the wishy-washy death "Someday" from preventable obesity-caused conditions.  Sure, we all know that we ought to be more healthy.  But what if being more fit was an actual way of surviving the crazed maniac carrying a sharpened machete, right here, right now?  And those criminals that cost us so much money to house and feed and reform would be getting the fees that the diet industry is now raking in.  They'd also have a new lease on life as a trained fitness professional.    What do you think-- can I get a diet book deal on this plan? Will the new  urlLink combo of fitness  and  urlLink prison reform  appeal to the government types that would implement such a plan?  Getting tough on obesity at the same time we're decreasing taxpayer burden and reforming life-long criminals.  I think my new plan should at least get me a few million dollars of advance sales.

      Last week, after a majorly irritating screw up with my normal prescription birth control, and since I'm not quite ready to be a parent (even though I am getting a bit long in the tooth) I had to purchase "alternate forms of contraception."  So I went to Big Pharmacy Chain Store to get said alternate form.  Since I have been married for, like, ever, and since before then I wasn't exactly a swinging kinda gal, I am not an expert on brands and types of condoms.  So while I was trying to shop around, this hairy big guy was standing RIGHT in FREAKIN' FRONT of the rack-o-rubbers, which they have to keep out in front of the pharmacist counter cause people steal them.  (I guess it's better to risk a shoplifting conviction than the embarrassment of purchasing said products for some folks.  Although imagine the "rap sheet" on that one-- a felony condom theft conviction.)  Since they have to keep them out in the open, there were like, a million people standing around waiting to talk to the gal in the white coat.  And you know, it's important to think about this purchase.  I mean, did I want "extra sensitive with spermicide" or "ribbed for her pleasure?"  I finally decided, after hairy guy grokked why I was swerving around him trying to look nonchalant, and moved outa my way.  So here's the point.  I am a fair skinned, with freckles, red head.  Back when I was a kid, I used to blush terribly.  As I got older and more jaded, few things really got to me.  But lately, I've been troubled with it again.  So here I was, a thirtysomething married chick, and my cheeks (not those cheeks, really, get your mind out of the gutter) were flaming red, prickly hot, and I was hysterically suppressing that giggle you get when Mr. Brown is yelling at you in French class cause you weren't paying attention and you know if you laugh it'll just make it worse but that makes you want to laugh all the more.  And even more embarrassed that I was embarrassed.  I mean, I am, after all, a modern woman.  Why am I blushing here?!    And it gets better.  When I finally randomly grabbed my box, (sort of like I imagine guys must when sent out for tampons-- blindly grabbing the first thing in sight) and went to the front counter to pay, the guy pointed out this "buy one get one free" coupon for two brands NOT of the brand I was currently holding.  So I either had to admit that I was too embarrassed to go get the bargain rubbers (which I'll probably never use-- unless I do some sort of crazy art project) or face said crowd of pharmacy extras again.  So I had to face the crowd of people who I'm quite sure were staring at me with a "you're going straight to Hell missy" look* and pick out TWO boxes-- carefully picking the correct brand this time.  So then, jauntily swinging my bag and still blushing furiously, I left the Chain Pharmacy with my illicit goods.  I wish they'd have had some illegal fireworks to buy, too.    *after all, we were in very Catholic Louisiana, where  The Passion  was on THREE screens at the theater and  Starsky & Hutch  on TWO.  (We went, heathens that we are, to see the cop flick).  Yup.  STRAIGHT to Hell.  :)

       Today:   I added my dissertation counter over there on the right---->  it's the witch/moon.  The number on the graphic reflects how many pages I have written so far on the dissertation.  I plan to update it as frequently as possible.  The number currently reflects "rough draft" pages-- and it always tends to get longer as I go.

      This afternoon, lying in my hammock in the backyard.  Spring has begun to feel permanent; 77 degrees F and the sky is an impossible shade of blue-- a blue that, if you saw it in someone's painting of the sky you would say looks fake.  The trees from the neighbor's yard have begun to bud chartreuse-green leaves that poke from the tips of skinny bare brown branches that have sheltered doves and squirrels all winter.  There is a slight breeze, and the same doves mournfully call to each other, as though they're saddened by the coming warmth. Grackles buzz warning clicks and swoop down on green lizards.  The windchimes on the back grapevine trellis sing out irregular, gentle high notes.  Up above my head, the branches of the neighbor's tree merge with those of my oaks-- the moss covered wooden arms twist and bend, and a canopy of greens and dark browns, shadows and hot white sunlight breaks up that impossible blue sky.    A black butterfly flits across, darting towards and away, driven, perhaps, on those same slight breezes which give the wind chimes their music.    I look at the way the light and shadows play on the leaves of the Japanese plum tree in the corner; in some places, the green is so dark it looks black, and others are softly white, as though you would touch velvet.   urlLink Monet  was supposed to have been obsessed with capturing a certain quality of light on a pool of water lilies, painting the same greens and purples and blues over and over again.  I can understand his obsession as I lie in the hammock, holding it still from a sway that makes me slightly nauseous.  My cat meows; she sounds as though her heart has been broken by some deeply wounding loss; the end of the meow is slightly breathy and sounds like a baby crying.    Spring in Texas, with oak trees and mockingbirds whirling above, is glorious.  It makes up, a little, for the Hell of summer that is ahead of us.

      Oh the pressure is intense when you drive a fancy car.  I never realized it before.  I actually caught myself yesterday contemplating the need to put on makeup before I went out to run errands, cause I wanted to look all hot in my new Green Fancy Car (did I mention before?  It's a Mitsubishi Eclipse).  It has a sun roof, and yesterday I was stopped behind a truck at a redlight listening to Marilyn Manson's cover of "Tainted Love" (which is way way cool, by the way, and only available on the  urlLink Not Another Teen Movie  soundtrack) and I noticed the guy in front of me "checkin' me out."  When you're as ancient as I am (I'm not really that old, it's hyperbole) and as married to a big guy whose presence usually discourages too much active flirtation from other guys, it's really fun to be eyeballed in traffic.  So I was feeling very cool.  Then the CD changed into playing Rick James' " urlLink Superfreak ". I really like that mix someone (mmmm could it be me?) made for my driving pleasure.  I find myself thinking up reasons to go out and run errands or something.    Hopefully this vanity will pass.  It IS after all, just a car.  But I never knew that it was so fun to have a cool car!  I mean, J, my best friend, has one of the all time coolest cars in the world (a ruby red new  urlLink Mini Cooper ) and riding in it was fun, but with it not being mine, I just didn't get that same vibe.  Now I get it.  I added a leopard skin (faux, thank you) seat cover to my side yesterday (leather seats are sweaty, man!).  So it's pimpin.  Now I just need a forty and a beeyatch.  (I guess I don't really need the beeyatch, but maybe every now and then I'll call someone my beeyatch.  Maybe I'll call Keval that later today.  That'll be funizzle.)  Okay.  I'm really sorry about the lame attempts to use ghetto language in the last paragraph.  I know it's not at all natural coming from me.  But my native faux accents don't translate well to text (I can do a great Irish, and southern bell.)    So, since I can't think of a catchy way to end this entry, I'll just do it abruptly.   *p.s.  Spellcheck is so funny. It wanted to replace beeyatch with bewitch and funizzle with fungal.  And Mistubishi?  It's mitzvah.  Mazel Tov to you, too!

      When I first met my  urlLink hubbie , he was in flight school for the military.  Not what you would think of, especially from looking at him, as a hippie type.  But while we were dating, he told me that one of his fantasies was to put his possessions into a backpack and walk/travel/hitchhike around the country, Beatnik/ urlLink Kerouac  style.  I was impressed, because one expects guys in his line of work to be ultra conservative, and the hippie beatnik lifestyle isn't exactly that.  But since I've gotten to know him (over 13 years in May!) I know that he is even more deviant than most people might think.  Why?  Because he looks all normal, but his heart is the heart of a radical wack-o.  Really.  (Not in a way you'd expect-- totally a surprising way.)    I thought of this yesterday because, as I was driving back the 7.5 hours from Shreveport to San Antonio, there were at least four guys hitch-hiking on the side of the highway. All of them, from the quick glance I got (driving at 70 mph you don't have much time for leisurely inspection of walkers) they looked like the typical hitch-hikey guy-- if not long long hair and unshaven dishabille, they were scruffy in other ways.  But lots of them!  I know for a fact I haven't seen that many hitchers in recent days-- it's not exactly the preferred mode of travel nowadays-- too risky for both hitcher and potential person picking them up.  So my conservative guy would definitely look different from those fellas.    Andrew likes to say "It's warm weather and the hippies are on the move...." when he sees one of the guys on the road.  Not completely enviously, but a little.  You never know within whom beats the heart of a  urlLink libertarian , tree-hugging guy.  Especially deviantly because some of his other opinions are so different from the typical so-called "liberal" ones.    But if you know anything about Kerouac, he was not exactly the same type of more liberal, more stereotypically "hippy-esque" guy in some ways as  urlLink Ginsberg  and his buddies-- Kerouac was a little more on the "football playing, lumberjack shirt wearing" type of working class guy.  That's more like my boy.  And I like him thataway.

      I know it sucks when someone you read everyday leaves.  I really wish I could get access to a computer when I'm in Shreveport, but it's impossible since there aren't any Internet cafes, and Andrew doesn't have access in his room.  Anyway.  I'll post an interesting blog later today, but for now, just to say I'm here.  I need to do a bunch of things today-- mow the lawn, tackle the 5 foot weeds in the back yard (I'm not kidding-- they're plotting revolution RIGHT NOW.)  Eventually, I want to write some more, and I'm reading a new theory book.  Tell me, when did a 24 hour day get so short?!    Anyway.  More later.

It's going to be rainy, too.  But I have two books on tape-- Gregory MacGuire's Mirror, Mirror, and The Dante Club.  Fun & thrills!  (Seriously.)  I'm looking forward to Mirror Mirror.    See you all on the downside.  Or rather, Sunday.

      In certain areas of my life, I am a bit of a slob.  I can't, for the life of me, keep my closet clean.  My office usually looks a bit like a tornado hit it, and we aren't in Kansas anymore, Toto.  My husband, on the other hand, is a neat person.  Every night before bed he usually putters around the kitchen, cleaning, loading the dishwasher, making sure the mess I made while cooking is taken care of.  He does one load of laundry when his laundry basket gets full, whereas I pile the clothes on top of the wicker basket in my closet till they are overflowing, then leave things that can't be dried in the dryer hanging around the house for days.  When I write, I put piles of paper everywhere; articles that I plan to quote from pile up, the edits of whatever chapter I'm working on lie partially in use, partially discarded on the floor.  And even when I'm done with them I usually leave them there till some day when I get an urge to have a clean workspace (usually followed by grumbling from the spouse) and throw everything away, amazed that here is that article from last Fall I used to teach that class on introductory paragraphs, and here is the essay by that student two semesters ago.....    So, in the light that I do love my hubby and would like to NOT drive him crazy, I've been trying very hard to be better about this kind of thing.  To be aware of my space more, less like a "distracted absent-minded professor" who is so focused on ideas that s/he wanders around like Einstein losing his train ticket*.  I'm trying to be a more gracious guest in the world, trying to not take up more space that I deserve and intrude upon others' space.  So I've cleaned my office, donated four bags of clothes I never wear but was pack-ratting away in the closet (in case someday I wanted to wear a size 14 wool green jacket or the skirt someone gave me and I never once wore and wasn't my style but still was kind of cute.....)    And I have to admit, while I sit here in my  nice and clean office with my  urlLink Virgin of Guadalupe rose candle   (second from left) burning away for inspiration (and to mask smelly cat activities) I like it.  I like feeling sort of clean.  I like my closet being laid out like a buffet of cute tops and pants, easy to locate and decide what to wear today.  I like it that my new car (complete with new car smell!) has no discarded piles of books or old empty water bottles and Starbuck's cups under the seat.    So, is this a new leaf turned over or a temporary ripple where the leaf will go right back where it was before?  We'll see.  Time will tell.  I hope I can do both be the distracted literary professor AND the neat, pleasant to be around companion.  Is there a patron saint for messy people?  I'll bet there is.   urlLink St Anne  is the patron saint of Housekeepers.  So I guess she works; combine her with  urlLink St. Jude , patron saint of impossible situations and I'm halfway there.  Then, just to keep it in perspective, a prayer to  urlLink St. Teresa of Avila , patron saint of writers.  Since I'm trying, after all, to write, and that's why it's so messy; perhaps if she lends a little help I can finish the writing & have more time for cleaning.  Since I'm not Catholic, and not really even very traditionally Christian, I'll appeal to these saints from a hippie neo pagan sort of recognition that any local deity can help out a bit, if you ask with reverence & respect, and say thank you.  So.  Thus far, I'm asking for help from:  several Catholic Saints, a voodoo loa, a Buddhist goddess.  With all that clout on my side, surely I'll get it right eventually.     *this is based on an old story that a train conductor once spotted Einstein on a train, and while the famous physicist was patting his pockets frantically for a ticket, the conductor said "oh, that's okay, Professor, I know you bought a ticket" and Einstein replied "no, I have to find the ticket, otherwise, I don't know where I'm going".

      I'm getting a new (used) car today!  Whee! We weren't totally in the market, and it's a little unexpected, but my neighbor sells cars part time and came into this really cool Mitsubishi that has low low miles, driven only by this "little old man" from Pasadena (sort of) and it's too good a deal to pass up.  So I'm waiting for the neighbor to get off work and we're going to transfer the title today.  To me!  A sporty car that has all kinds of cool features.  I am so excited.  It's a long long way from the pieces of crap cars I grew up with, and it's the nicest car I've ever owned.  We borrowed from "Bank of Dad" and will be able to repay most of it when we sell Andrew's old car.    But no (real) work got done today because in honor of the new car's 4 CD disc changer, I had to play around and burn new car music mixes.  I'm on the "mellow mix" right now. It's cool; with lots of fun music.  And I realized I really like the I Am Sam soundtrack, and am going to pop by Sam's Wholesale to see if they've got it there (I'm sure they do-- it's one of those movie soundtracks & they usually have them).  So today has been a total wash.    But still.  Vroom Vroom.

      So the Prince concert.   Yeah!  When you've been around as long as Prince has, I think you run the risk of sounding like a human juke-box, coverband, of yourself.  Sure, you can do new music, but your fans want to hear those hits you did 20 years ago over & over again.  When the new stuff comes up, they might like it, but then they want you to sing "Little Red Corvette" for the five bizillionth time again.    Prince, at the concert, played some of his new stuff.  But even when he played his old stuff he made it sound new-- playing a sort of acoustic version of said "Little Red Corvette" where the audience sang much of it, while he looked on with expressions that, as my friend J said, would make even a committed heterosexual man say "Damn, I'd do him." (To which our committed heterosexual friend G said "that is not true; but I woulda done that sax player, cause that girl knew how to blow.")  Yes.  These are the conversations I have with friends.    Anyhoo.  Prince was the fabulousest-- but don't go there expecting the human jukebox syndrome.  He was really great really really really.  And the concert rocked-- I was actually exhausted from dancing by the end.  And even in the cheap seats, we had a great view of the stage (which was "in the round") and a great extra view of the giant TV screen which caught every expression and every eyebrow quirk (and a few eyebrow raisings when we sang off key).  But he loved us anyway.    As the man said:  "My name is Prince, and I am funky."    Oh yeah.    *I usually don't blog with other people helping, but the co-suggestions for titles included:  Starstruck  &  Night With An Icon  but I like my own title bestest. So in the interest of good relations, I post said title suggestions here.

      So, there's not much to say other than that we're getting all set for the Purple Royal One this evening.  Fun & music & dancing and perhaps drinking before five o'clock.  We've got vodka & various juices.    I heard this cool cover of Snoop's  urlLink Gin & Juice , performed by this country-blue grass style group.  The Gourds....  then, when I went to their website it turns out they're from locally-- near Austin.  I'll totally have to see if they're playing anywhere near. Looks like fun.  You should hear them say beyatch.    Stay tuned for details of the concert.

      I have this habit-- I don't know if it's a good one or bad one-- of associating people whose blogs I read regularly with people I know in "RL*".  So those bloggers who somehow remind me of someone I like in RL get the added bonus of me thinking of them with the "pre-approved credit" of the friend that they remind me of.  (And the interest rates are very competitive, too.)    For example,  urlLink Boy Vs Computer,  for some reason, reminds me of a long time friend George.  I don't think there's a good reason to think of George, other than a very slight resemblance in appearance, and a wry sense of humor.  But it doesn't matter.  I read BVC with the fondness I would if George had a blog (which, as far as I know, he doesn't.  Pooey.)  Even the fact that he's apparently "taking a break" from writing cause he doesn't have anything new to say sort of makes me think, "ah, that George with his break-y ways."    And  urlLink Steve  reminds me of my friend Steve.  There's a fairly obvious reason for that reminder, but there's also a quirkiness to both Steves' sense of humor that is similar.  Plus he reads my blog and procrastinates, which I have to admire in a person.   I really like his idea of posting a chart with frequent search terms and the answers to those terms, but most of my search terms are not nearly as quirky as the ones he gets.  It makes me want to make some up.  Most of my random google searchers seem to be people looking for porn, and I don't really feel like answering those search strings.     urlLink Feministe  kinda reminds me of myself when I was a younger feminist, a little more radical (the time that got me labeled a man-hater in this one English class.)  I like seeing what my younger self is thinking, cause old worn out dissertation writing Kim sometimes doubts her feminism.  Plus, Feministe is just so good at putting her finger on the current issue for anyone concerned with gender-- and she really works hard on her blog-- finding great quotes, making almost every entry relevant and timely.  (And the ones that aren't are fun cause we get a glimpse into her life that makes her seem more like the girl in the next apartment).  Which is what all of us are, really.     urlLink Glovefox  makes me happy because she's a domestic goddess, too, and she lives in Oxford, where I visited a few years ago (Oxford-- I didn't yet know GF, although I think she was there at the time and I might have walked past her, unknowing the later Internet connection we would make.)  I know it's sort of pointless to put a link to her for most of you cause she currently has her blog on password mode but I'm putting the link there anyway.    Then the  urlLink Fish  just makes me think of the single Kim that never happened-- my single-girl life was very short, and, being in small-town Florida, not nearly as interesting.  Plus, she's got that "Sex in the City" feel to her (which I'm sure she has heard millions of times.)  I find myself looking forward most to her posts, and she's a fairly prolific writer, so I can get my fun-loving single girl fix pretty regularly.  I always wish her luck finding her bicycle because my bicycle sits on the couch in his baggy workout shorts and tank top, paying bills with a grumpy look on his face, and I hope everyone who wants to can find whatever bicycle they really need.     urlLink Other Kim  is where I go when I want to read someone who is pushing herself to write, and who sometimes makes the Victorian Kim blush a bit with her well-written but "heated" short stories.  (If she ever wanted to, Other Kim could give Ann Rice a run for her money on the erotica front).  I do like it best, though, when I hear something about her life, too.  I guess it's the nature of blogs that we are trying to learn about other people out there on the "commercial highway" the Internet has become.  We try to make it a community of sorts, and I like getting those updates on things like how NOT to make Rice Krispie Treats.    Oh, and  urlLink Estella  just makes me laugh so hard I spray coffee on the computer screen.  She makes me jealous, and I wish I wrote so well and had such constantly funny ideas.  And she has this loyal bunch of commenters who all have really funny blogs, too, and I always end up wasting so much time if I follow those links to the other blogs.    So there's really no point, no pithy moral to add to the end of this post.  It's just something I was thinking about.   And you know that if you read this blog, there's often no real point, but lotsa words.  And paragraphs, neatly separated and grammatically correct.  So that maybe reminds YOU of your high school English teacher who waxed poetically about Joseph Heller and read your class some of her poetry now and then.  And was frequently sort of screwy.    *Real Life

      We're switching our cellular service from one phone company to the other, and want to "bring our numbers" with us.  This requires paperwork, and the company we're dumping is being a pain in the butt, apparently.  But what's funny is that the company we're "hiring" had this computer autodial call me this morning cause of the glitch in the switch and so I got this phone call where a computer called me, told me that it was "Insert Phone Company Name Here" and to "please hold for a representative" because all of them were busy.    It's not like we don't spend enough of our time on hold in this mechanized world without being called up by a bored computer and put on hold.  The lady who I finally got to talk to apologized profusely-- and while I said it was really okay, and sort of funny, it is actually a little creepy to think of the phone company's computer just kicking out an autodialer when it wants to talk to someone.    "Hi, this is me, phone company computer.  Whatchadoin?" "Um.  How did you get this number?" "I  am  a computer database. DUH! How do you think I got it?  Anyway.  I was bored and I've enjoyed our time on hold.  Remember the time I played some of your favorite music selections while you walked around the house? So I was thinking we should get together more often.  Wanna see a movie later today?  I hear  2001:  A Space Odyssey  is playing at that old "rerunning classic films" theater in New York City. I've booked you tickets to come to fly up, and paid with your Mastercard.  Your taxi should be there in a minute.  Don't bother packing; I've ordered you some clothes from Barney's which will be delivered when your flight arrives at LaGuardia."   ::honk:: taxi sounds in driveway. "You didn't expect me, the computer, to come to you, did you?"

       1. On Sunday afternoon, I like to just... Relax with my husband-- that might mean sleeping late, drinking lattes, watching movies, doing yard work, shopping for home-improvement stuff.  2. I'm behind someone at a traffic light, the light turns green and they just sit there, I... will wait a few seconds, but if they don't move, will tap the horn gently.  3. My immediate reaction to someone making a nasty remark to me is... To wonder why they did that-- but usually, this only happens with strangers and I just blow them off.  But I am hurt if it's someone I know.   4. If I had to live in a state/country where it was cold most of the year, I would... not like it.  I grew up in the south and need to be warm.  When I did live in a cold state, it drove me nuts!  5. When the weather outside is hot and humid, I prefer to... Ah, this is almost all the time in Texas-- I do anything I feel like doing.    6. My favorite 'comfy' clothes to wear around the house is... a long, loose sundress, (it's usually not something I would go out in public wearing.)    7. If given a deadline at work/school to finish a project, I usually... work slowly on it for a while, doing research, then finish it up near the deadline.  I procrastinate (duh) but generally it's not LAST last minute.  8. If someone gave me a pet for my birthday, I would... Be happy!  I love pets.  But I don't encourage this-- I think buying a pet is a very personal decision and unless you know me very well, you might get it wrong.   9. As far as watching the clock on weekends, I... Only do it if there's something to do-- like go to a movie or something.  10. I usually wash my car about every... time it's dirty.  I like my shiny new green car, and like it to stay that way.  But it's usually when I fill up my tank of gas, since that way I get the carwash discounted.

      There's a good reason why this is not a political blog-- I hate it when I can't express the frustrations and many shades of gray of my political opinions without more work and time and energy than I'm willing or able to devote to researching good political arguments.  It's fairly easy to spend some time thinking about how to express a quirky story or anecdote, it takes a little while to polish it but it's not like I need to do some major reading to make sure that my political argument is well-researched and documented-- which I think is the responsibility of anyone who does that kind of blog.    But what else do I leave out?  Frustrations with the hubby?  The little argument with some sibling?  The bad day I had because of ???  These are all hypothetical-- I haven't really had a bad day-- other than a brief moment where I was trying to "be good" and ended up being a jerk ANYfrickinWay.  Sigh.  There are other things I could and don't write about, but to mention them would be writing about them, right?    But.  I am a competitive sort by nature.  I read other good political blogs, or other funnier than mine blogs and I want to compete.  I wish I lead a fun and interesting single-girl life that read like Sex in the City, or that my marriage was quirky enough to compete with that sort of blog (it is, but I still want to keep some things private).    It doesn't matter that I don't compete, (by my choice) that my readership (Hi Mom) is so much smaller and more personal than those blogs I'm feeling competitive with.  So I get all angst-y about it.  Maybe whining and feeling anxious is more my style, then.  Feeling paranoid and a bit like people are talking about me behind my back has always worked for me in the past.    But I'm up much earlier than normal today (the cat is back in bed already-- you know it's early when you've worn out the cat who likes to wake people up).  So I ought to get a lot of work done today.  And I had scheduled in feeling sorry for myself at approximately 8:30 today, so I can check that off my to-do list.*    See how much I'm already getting done by getting up earlier?    *and a bit earlier than sheduled, too.  See how efficient I am?

      Sitting for an ungoddessly amount of time (last Wednesday) in the DFW airport, to amuse myself, I:     Pretended to be doing the  urlLink yoga sun salute  in my head. Breathed deeply and imagined the poses flowing, tree through downward facing dog through cobra and back again. It actually made me feel almost as relaxed as if I had really done it.    Stretched my calves and wiggled my neck back and forth on the plastic airport seat and caught cute college guy staring at me.    Sat & contemplated why other passengers were at the airport. Business. Business. Visting grandkids. College break.    Played surreptiously with my bellybutton. I  really  like my bellybutton. But then, because I felt sort of naughty with my bellybutton-y antics, I started to imagine the other passengers differently.    WHAT IF  The guy in the 6:30 pm (CST) dappled sunlight, with his Ollie North haircut and green and blue leaf pattern golf shirt and white tennis shoes-- maybe he secretly likes to watch ladies' volleyball while wearing his very own pink spandex bikini with push up bra top, complete with those little gel falsies in the top. Maybe, he's even thinking about it. RIGHT. NOW.  The skinny college kid I caught earlier looking at me, with long hair parted in the middle, unabashedly chomping on a huge bag of those cone shaped  urlLink Doritos , inhaling them one by one into his mouth with all the pleasure of an oral fixation junkie on a major bender. Maybe he, every weekend, likes to clean his shower with lavender scented products until the white grout would make that  urlLink drill sergeant guy  in  urlLink Full Metal Jacket  (you know, the one that made  urlLink Private Pyle  go ape shit "I am in a world of shit" crazy?)-- made him say "Damn boy-ah, that IS clean.  (Okay, so that one isn't as interesting, but stick with me.)   And the grandmotherly lady in the half reading glasses, speaking into her cell phone and then abandoning the conversation for a book with a floral pattern on the front, probably one of those romances with the plucky Irish girl who, after her husband leaves her, beats the odds and opens her own baked-goods catering business, only to find true-love with her partner. Maybe that sedate, Irish-romance reading old lady, after chuckling over her cell phone while she wiggles her French manicured toes in her cute black snake-skin sandals---- Maybe she secretly logs onto p@rn message boards, after creating a persona of a 300 pound man (maybe his name is Tiny-- oooo the irony) and maybe her secret guy persona likes to eat Twinkie after Twinkie (deep fried) while being spanked by biker chicks.   Maybe. It could happen.    Well. That little exercise killed 20 minutes of airport time. But then I felt guilty cause college guy was on the same plane as me and was smiling when I told this joke to the old guy in the seat next to me (about how Dollie Parton once said she didn't mind dumb blonde jokes cause she wasn't dumb or blonde).  The old guy was a low-talker who told me all about how back in the old days "the colored folk" had to sit in the back. He said-- (the old guy not college-cutie) "I'm sure you don't remember those days" making me uncomfortable and afraid sweet little old man was going to turn into crazy racist old man (He didn't really. But there were a few minutes I was worried there).  So.  Anyway.  I scribbled most of this stuff into my handy dandy little spiral notebook, and then we had a little excitement when we discovered A BAG that had been sitting unattended for a LONG TIME and security had to come pick it up.  They stood there looking at it without touching it (it was about the size of a shaving gear bag) and then I told them that the lady over next to me had moved it recently. So it wasn't going to blow up if they touched it.   So they picked it up and took it away.    Maybe I shouldn't have said anything-- they might have brought out the dogs to sniff it suspiciously.  That would have been even more entertaining.    See.  I'm always thinking of you guys.

      Tituba caught a mouse last night-- at about 5 am, I heard her mewing excitedly.  This was not the "I've got a bug" or "I've got a lizard" meow.  It was much more emphatic.  She had already killed it, luckily for me, cause in my sleepy haze I tried to grab it. If it had been alive, I'm quite certain it would have bitten me and I'd be happily having rabies shots or something today.  Bleah!  I dropped it in the outside garbage, and she brought it back to us again this morning, a little worse for its few hours in the trash.    Now, I realize you're saying "she's a cat; that's what cats do".  But for Tituba, this is a banner event.  She's almost 11 years old and she's never bagged a mouse before.  She wants us to put its little head up on a plank of wood, get it stuffed, put the date on a little label underneath.  Take a picture of her smiling next to it, holding it up for the camera.   I told her, maybe next time.

      Last night when we were driving back from Louisiana, we went through a massive lightning storm outside of Waco.  There wasn't all that much rain, really-- in a few areas, it was fairly strong, but mostly we got drizzles.  But the lightning was really cool.  It flashed all around us, with huge massive, gold bolts.  A few times it really seemed close.  I wish I could do a better job of describing how massive and awesome it was-- in the way that the word is supposed to mean-- of "inspiring awe".    We got home at around one AM.  Long day!  Then, around six-ish, Tituba had "a spell" of acting really weird.  I think my father-in-law, who was feeding her, didn't get her bowl cleaned out and she got some bad food.  She was meowing like she was hurt, or scared, or something.   Her eyes were a little glassy, and she was just so upset!  I finally just figured it was too early to call the vet, and if she wasn't okay by the time it was late enough, I would call.  But she's fine now.  I swear-- in some ways, it's worse than having a baby cause at least at some point a baby would be able to tell me what was wrong!  :)   Anyway.  That's the news.  Andrew's home, and we're having some folks over for fajitas & margaritas.  And new Skinny Cow ice cream.  (mmmmm).

       That Book Meme: Why 23? Grab the nearest book.  Open the book to page 23.  Find the fifth sentence.  Post the text of the sentence in your journal along with these instructions.   From  Practical Magic , by Alice Hoffman: There had been a whole pen of scrawny brown-and-white specimens, but by the time the aunts got through with them they never screeched again; in fact, it was their silence that allowed for them to be carried off by stray dogs in the middle of the night.  I'll have to admit it took a couple of books to get a real result-- the two I picked up first were very short, unhelpful sentences.   I needed something juicy to think about.    This is a sentence in the midst of describing the Aunts' magic abilities in this wonderful magical feminist book.  But out of context like this, it sounds horribly like some sort of rape imagery, or statement on women's vulnerability.  Not that women are necessarily supposed to be represented by chickens, but perhaps it's because I just read on Feministe  urlLink a story about the producer  from Girls Gone Wild being accused of date rape.  So it seemed to fit with that idea.  That's, of course, part of the power of a  urlLink meme .

      Um.  If you ever wondered if you could do a great job highlighting your very long hair with one of those home hair coloring/highlighting "expert" kits for about 20 bucks then I have an answer for you.   The. answer. is. no. fucking. way.  I tried to do it today, and not only was the color totally different from what the box color looked like BUT the highlights didn't really work.  My hair looked weird weirder weirdest.  I called the 1-800 number on the hair color box & their helpful suggestion of putting EVEN MORE home hair color on my already weird hair did not sound like a good idea.  So I went to the mall, to my normal "I will never cheat on you again" hairdresser, Ann, and she fixed my freakish hair.  Now it looks definitely different from my normal subtle highlights to my natural redness.  I have bleached blond bits (they're kind of honey colored).  It looks pretty hip, to tell you the truth, but is very new for me.  So much so that now, despite my previous plans to just hang out at home and work on the responsibilities, I want to do something!!!  And all my loyal normal "do-something with" friends are already doin' stuff, and not really meet-able at this point.  So I'm all dolled up and nowhere to go tonight.  But Tomorrow-- I'm going to Shreveport to pick up Andrew!!  So he'll see a dolled up wife get off the plane.    I'll be back on Friday, late.  So in the meantime, I want you to contemplate  urlLink this hair,  and know that mine is not that bad.  It's actually kinda cool now.  Photos later.....

      The worst thing about the fact that I get several hits a day from people looking for Kim Possible p@rn is the fact that there are websites out there where you can actually, apparently, get it.  As well as Simpsons p@rn.  I didn't go to the sites, in order to avoid getting trapped in pop up Hell.  But I did look in google to see how many hits there were.  Lots.  Look for yourself, if you've got the stomach for it.    Otherwise, there is NO KIM POSSIBLE P@RN HERE!    There is a hot Kim.  But no naked pictures will ever be posted.    Did you folks know it's easy to get p@rn?  All you have to do is go to the 7-11 or local convenience store and pick up a magazine.  You don't have to search the Internet fruitlessly for hours.    Just a public service from me to you.  I mean, with the  urlLink  p@rn industry on hold cause of the AIDS thing , it's a bit of a crisis point for fans.

      Here's the deal.  Today I am cleaning house. Spring cleaning of sorts.  Because Andrew comes home this week.  (As has made it into the blog a few times already.  So sue me.  I'm excited.)    I'm waving the swiffer wet jet around, dusting, washing rugs and sheets,* re-cleaning the office which had managed to stay clean after my last overhaul a few months ago for a lonnnnnng time, until my printer issues last weekend.  I cleaned the bar shelves, and wiped the dust off of all the liquor (and we have a lot.  Really.  Dean Martin and the Rat Pack aint got nothin' on us martini-wise).  Of liquor.  Not dust.  At least,  not anymore.   And I'm actually really having, dare I say it, FUN.  I'm beginning to worry about myself.  Really.  Did I, overnight, become an obsessive compulsive pod-Kim?  Do you think you'd know if aliens snuck in, made a pod clone of yourself, and whisked the other you away to live in an alien zoo?  Cause those of you who actually know me would know that I am NOT a housekeeper.  NOT a cleaner upper in any big way.  I mean, I don't live in a pig pen-- I keep the house pretty clean most of the time.  But I don't get those pesky corners, and the ceiling fans pretty much have to clean themselves off.  (And since I have a black cat, you can imagine what gets stuck in the corners and on the ceiling fan).    So in honor of my transformation, I am announcing this to be Housekleen day of the year.  It may be a one time only event.  One never knows with me.    I also heard from Andrew recently about future fun trips we'll maybe be making, including one to somewhere on the west coast of England, Alaska, and Boston.  (They're all maybes.  But cool maybes).  I think he mentioned a couple of other places, but they slipped my windex-addled mind.    *I even bought a drawer organizer for my bathroom drawer-- which is usually a nightmare to find anything in.  All my little colors of nail polish are neatly in rows in the drawer, waiting for my little fingers to find easily.   Oh yeah.  And did you know they're remaking the movie?  With Nicole Kidman?  It's supposed to be out soon.  What does that say about women's issues, dya think?  I am interested to see what they do with it, cause the first one was good but under-rated.

      This morning as I was stretching into being awake, with the cat purring loudly in my ear (she does that cause, since she's just PURRING, there's no way I can be mad, right?) I for some reason thought of this apartment complex I lived in when I first met my husband.    My mom & I lived in one apartment, and my sister and her two young kids in another.  The landlord, who we all thought was cool at first cause he bought new air conditioners (a big deal in Florida) and seemed nice, was an amazing psycho who (among other things) used to barge in to the apartment without knocking.  This was awkward in that once when he did it I was totally naked (well, except for a luckily placed towel) just about to get into the shower but having forgotten something in my bedroom (which was where he barged into-- it was sort of supposed to be a living room, hence, had a front door, but had been converted to my bedroom).  Back in those days, for a reason that seems inexplicable to me now, we didn't usually lock the doors (it probably had something to do with the kids running in and out of the two apartments).    This landlord took a real dislike to my sister (who can, I'll admit, be hard to like sometimes).  He was really a jerk, though.    Anyway, the fond memories are of the time I met my hubby-to-be.  Neither of us knew it then, of course.  For our first date, he met me* at the apartment.  I was cleverly perched on a comfy chair doing EMBROIDERY (yes to all you  urlLink Laura Ingalls Wilder  fans-- to make him know what a great little catch I would be)..... he had wandered to the wrong apartment and knocked on the door of one of the front ones, and found one of our neighbors, a big guy, in a swanky silky nightie.  I imagine this guy looked a bit like the crazy guy in  urlLink Silence of the Lambs .    But my poor hubby to be found me anyway, despite scary front-apartment guy not knowing which apartment I was in.    And the embroidery is in the guest bedroom.  It's cats.  And officially the LAST embroidery project I have done in more than ten years.  Mwah hah haha.  My evil plan to snag a man with my wifely arts worked!**    *He "MET" me at a bar.  There was dancing and a number on a bar napkin.  This discussion, dear readers, is of the FIRST DATE.  Not the bar meeting.   **I am, of course, a fabulous cook, still.  But I'm not very good at some other things.  Like organizing.  Which I must go and do NOW.

      Today we did a "Fiesta" activity-- an "arts & crafts" fair.  I was doing really well on not spending too much money on overpriced arts & crafts till just before the fair closed down.  Then I bought this ring I shouldn't have bought.  I have buyers' remorse. Ah well.    But it WAS a lovely day, and we heard Terri Hendrix play live for like, an hour and a half.  It was also fun watching her "roadies" stumble around and yell "rock & roll" between songs.  (Did I say fun?  I meant funny).    Tomorrow, I need to get SERIOUS dissertation writing done.  Andrew comes home this week, and I need to spend Tuesday cleaning house.  Then Wednesday, I'm flying to La, where I will be till we drive home Friday!!  Yay!  My six months alone is almost over!   And I can tell you, it's not a moment too soon.  Even my "sexy dreams" are starting to feature only me.  (It's sad, I know.)

      I went this morning to the old folks' home to dance, belly style, with my teacher & another student.  I got all dressed up in my new costume, did the whole "drag queen" make up, and it was fun.  The ladies liked it, and my teacher even danced with this one older man.  There was a little 2 1/2 year old boy there visiting his grandma and he really liked me-- he wanted to talk to me afterward forever.  He was very cute-- shy, but excited about us dancing.    I liked it.  At first I thought it was going to be scary cause it was one of those homes for slightly infirm older folks-- less the "retirement" home and more a nursing home.  Those places can be pretty depressing.  But this one seemed fairly nice, and the people there seemed happy enough.  Anyway.  I'll post pictures as soon as I can take up this whole roll on my little disposable camera.  It should be sometime in the next year or so.  : )    Now we're off to a fabric store to buy stuff for more harem pants & maybe to see Kill Bill 2.

      Did you know that the place to be on Friday night is apparently the 24 hour Wal Mart?  I had to pop in to get a couple of things for my "bellydancing for old folks" trip tomorrow.  I never thought at 10:30 pm on a Friday night there would be lots of kids, old folks, and shoppers galore at Wal Mart.  Lots of them were of the "older teen" variety.  Perhaps they get their parents to drop them off there?  And parental-units think it's safe cause, after all, it is Wal Mart.    It's almost as good as the older slightly portly guy I saw yesterday at Ross Discount store fondling the thong underwear.  I kid you not.  I was torn between thinking he was sweet cause he was looking to buy his wife some sort of sexy undies and that he was creepy cause he had some sort of fetish.  It was probably a cross between the two.    I don't make this stuff up, man.  :)

      That was  urlLink my fortune  this morning.  So I'm pretty sure that the universe is ganging up on me about getting some FRICKIN' writing done on my dissertation.  So go play with this fortune cookie thing, designed by previously mentioned in this blog  urlLink Steve  (not the Kluck-one you locals know, another Steve).    But just so's you know, things I did so far today:  bellydance practice-- 1.5 hours yoga, sun salutations-- 2 full ones "practiced"  (probably what, 20 minutes?) lots of blogs read comics read breakfast eaten (don't ask me what it was.  You'd probably think I'm weird). Cat petted. Husband talked to on cell phone. Stretched wrote to person who I bought bellydance costume from to find out why it's not here yet. lamented lack of costume already shivered (it's a little cold in here) read message boards on Fox's The Swan & was appalled.  Truly.  Why, oh why?  plan to do more work on dissertation write in blog  See?  When you put it that way, I've done tons today.  I should qualify for a nap from all that vigorous activity.   Plans for rest of day (in order)  Shower.  (Yes.  It IS about time) Drink latte. write on dissertation go to party hope to get costume in time for tomorrow's "performance" at old folks' home be witty amaze people with my beauty  So.  That's pretty much ALLs I got.

      I am not feeling well today.  I was fine up until lunchtime-- then I went with my father-in-law to the Greek place down the street.  I don't think it was the Greek food-- other than as spicy stuff it may have upset my tummy & I feel oh-so-vaguely nauseated.  Not enough to be sure I'm sick, but just enough to make me uncomfortable.  I really just want to lie around and take naps and whine.  So that's what I'm doing now.  Whining.    But I'm also working. I found a dissertation that has great research/quotes for my own work.  Now I just need to wrap my head around my ideas again and dig in to more writing.  I've sort of fallen out of the writing mode in the last two weeks or so, and have to get back in that frame of mind again.    But then, feeling woozy doesn't help.  Pout.

      I never used to notice the lack.  Recently, however, as many blog regulars have noted, I have a new "sexy" car.  And I have realized that, despite sexy music blasting, no one around these parts does the "car flirt."  When I was in Florida last summer with my sexy car, it happened, dude.  Car flirting. The "I notice you, do you notice me" sort of head nod to the music.  Not getting TOO interested, but noticing the sexy car and sexy red headed babe driving it.  Here in Texas, everyone seems to keep their eyes "STRAIGHT FORWARD".  As if their lives depended upon it.  I miss the car flirt.  It's harmless cruising behavior.  There is the Latino man-- and granted, they know the car flirt, but I usually don't have enough red light time with them... it just can't make up for all the red lights where cowboys just ignore me.  I'm feeling underappreciated.  Will you car flirt with me?  I'm listening to sexy music and my sun roof is down, as well as my windows.  I don't care what gender you are.  Just give me "THE EYE."  I promise to look back.  There may be some winking or even a hair flip.  Can you handle it?

      Now that the costume monkey is off my back, I thought I'd try to GET SOME REAL WORK done.  So I went into the trusty "work" file and found two dissertations I've been meaning to read for source material, quotes, etc.    And I'm trying to print them out now.  But my trusty printer, which has NEVER done this before now, is making this HORRIBLE grindy pain just kill me now noise.  It's really bad!!  This is punishment from the money gods for buying something.  I know it. The printer, which has always been reliable, is moments away from a blood spewing, makes-ebola-look-like-the-sniffles death.    Why did I bother trying to work at all then?  Oh.  Wait.  As I write this, it suddenly got better.  What the hell?   UPDATE  YAY!  Al from HP Tech Support is the coolest guy in the universe. And nameless guy who passed me on to Al is also way way way cool.  I won't say why he's cool-- if he ever read this, he would know.  And I don't want to get him in trouble if the HP Spies found this blog.  But he rocks the house way way old school.  My printer is all better now.  Apparently a sneaky piece of paper had wiggled its way down into a strange place behind the "fuser" where the sensors didn't see that it was there, and it took taking the fuser OUT to find it.  Sneaky bastards.  Those pieces of paper are evil, evil I tell you!  But now my printer is happy.  There were a few moments of spewing-- hot pink and blue and green toner powder did get a little wild there for a few minutes.  But Al handled it all with a calm voice, and I dedicate my first new print job to him.  (It's the rest of that dissertation I want to read today).  Which may or may not happen since I need to leave to go drinking in, oh, 45 minutes.  Hee hee.  Way to blow an ENTIRE DAY!!!!!

      Okay. On the strength of my decision to sell off about 100 bucks worth of books on Amazon to PAY FOR my new costume, and because Nissa said she knew I was going to do it,   I JUST BOUGHT MY NEW COSTUME.  Now if I could just have it instantly in my hands.    I wonder if it'll be here by Saturday?  That's when there's a "performance opportunity" a-waiting.    Mwah hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha  ha.

      You are all party to my complete moral breakdown today as I debate whether to spend the money on the new costume.  Hopefully you're not sick of it by now.   But see,  urlLink this is me in my old costume  (a whole year old!! and I've worn it several times now!)  Don't I need another one?    And here is the one I'm totally lusting over  urlLink IN MUCH LARGER VIEW .  Convince me that 150 bucks is a small price to pay for my continued happiness.

      If I promised to post a photo of myself wearing it, I could get someone who randomly surfed in here to buy  urlLink my bellydance outfit*  for me?  I mean, 150 bucks is chump change to porn addicts.  And I really would post a picture of myself wearing the costume.    Just a thought.  I just keep coming back to the computer and gazing longingly at the ebay file.  Sigh.  And getting nothing else accomplished.  (Other than watching the " urlLink REVEALED " of Kim Cattral.    Oh yes.  I reaaaaaaally deserve a PhD.     *see how, in a matter of hours, it has changed from "an outfit I really want" to already being called "mine"?  I think I need help.

      In case you don't cruise all my links on blogroll over there, I must must must share with you this gem I found linked on  urlLink Neil Gaiman's  web blog today.    urlLink The Exorcist, in 30 seconds, performed by bunnies .  Yes.  And they left the really dirty parts out so you CAN show it to young Jr.    Ah technology's sweet sweet gifts for the universe.    I like the song at the end.  But now it's going to be stuck in my head ALL FRICKIN' DAY.  That and the image of  urlLink Steve  in my desired bellydance outfit.

      Last year about this time I bought my current cool bellydance costume off ebay.  I like it alot.  But I'm beginning to get itchy palms for  urlLink this gorgeous number .  Is that so wrong???  Actually, I really want the maker of this costume's entire inventory.  But I must win the lottery first.   But I feel I cannot buy it since I have to pay for my car to be fixed.  Damn you car wreck fairies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Maybe I should hold a "Kim's New Costume" telethon.  Would anyone donate?  Probably not.  Sigh.

      There's this machine at the gym that is for leg presses.  It makes this noise as you go up and down that sounds like "WOW."  wow.  Wow.  Depending on how hard/soft you push, it sounds louder and/or more emphatic.    I was thinking that this would be a good innovation for many kinds of workout equipment.  Encouragement.  Cheering crowds when you run on the treadmill.  Gasps of wonder as you do thirty minutes on the elliptical or stair stepper.  Weight machines with built in "oooh... you're a stud" noises.  Motivation would increase, the country would scoot back from the levels of obesity we're at now.  WOOOOWWW.

      When I was an undergraduate in this Renassiance Revenge Tragedy course, this guy once asked me if he could borrow my notes for a class cause he was going to miss and, as he said "you always take such extensive notes."  Sheepishly, I didn't want to admit what I usually do in class is doodle.  I am listening, too, really, but I'm also doodling.  Often, the doodles have something to do with the conversation-- like, for example, if we're talking about Yeats I draw lots of Irish stuff.  When discussing  urlLink Alice in Wonderland , I drew Alice (she's not making it into this record since it wasn't a very good Alice.)    I'm  not  claiming to be an artist.  But I am quite the doodler.  I sometimes really like my doodles!   So on that note, here are the doodles from my conference attendance last week, with the relevant commentary.   First, we have my typical doodle-- swirly lines & knots.  I like these, cause they are easy & usually look pretty cool.  This one was during the discussion of Feminist Utopias & Dystopias.          See how I was thinking about witches?  And I think the "Lily" thing is a character from one of the books being discussed.  That or Lilith.  Who the heck knows now?     The second set of doodles is my " urlLink Hello Kitty " sequence.  You see several tried and rejected options in doodle 1, then the finished Kitty in two. There are also some later scribbles where I was apparently trying to do math.  At first I thought it was when I was figuring out my tip at the Italian place.  But now I realize it's when I was keeping track of the time allowed one of my panelists.  They get 20 minutes, so I write down when they ought to stop.  Cause I forget otherwise.  Oh yeah. And the whale is because Geoff (mentioned later) just HAD to bring up  urlLink Moby Dick .                  Now, when I was listening to this one panel on children's literature, I sketched several of the participants:        The lady who was reading about Susan Cooper's  urlLink Dark is Rising series , and the main character as a Campellian Hero:         The lady reading about  urlLink The Giver , and the racism dealt with in the text:      And Geoff, author of  urlLink How To Read Superhero Comics and Why You Should  (and a good friend of mine).  Note:  His mouth is not that big.  That is the artists' error.  But doesn't he look thoughtful?               Finally, my friend Ximena, who was sitting next to me: (and author of  urlLink Alien Woman ).     Then we have my last, and both favorite and most appalling doodle.  I have these nifty ostrich cowboy boots, which I was wearing that day.  This is my boot/foot.  It looks like I have some sort of wart or boil all over.  It is not at all attractive (although the boots really are cute).  But there's just something about the doodle that I really like.  So you're subjected to it here.

      This morning, on the Riverwalk, temperatures in the mid 70s, with a nice breeze and the green and reds and fuchsias of the flowers and water and music playing.  Enjoying a blueberry muffin and a latte (with two Splendas).  I saw this man who was all of the following things:  creepy, funny, and sort of intriguing.  I had seen him earlier on the escalator, talking softly to himself and chuckling.  And the cute teen girl next to him on the escalator, with raspberry pink hair pulled up in Bjork buns, wearing her ice cream shop uniform, when she realized he was talking to no one, moved uncomfortably and unobtrusively away from him and smiled at me as if to say "I'm not with him."  It wasn't a mean smile-- in fact, it was very sweet.   But later, I saw the same man from the escalator walking about the Riverwalk, near the outside wrought aluminum tables.  He was tall, actually very well-groomed.  He was wearing sandals and loose, comfy clothes-- and really looked like the typical Riverwalk tourist out for some souvenir shopping.  Until you realized he was having an animated conversation with no one you could see.  He wasn't harassing anyone, or yelling-- nothing at all aggressive.  But that, my friends, is where I'm going with this.  I read lots of sci-fi and fantasy, where you find people who communicate with ghosts (that most people can't see but which are real in the story) or fairies, or a hologram from the future tuned to the brain waves of the person you  can  see.    This guy even waved his hands about in an emphatic gesture now and then.  Perhaps he was talking to someone I couldn't see-- and not in a "schizophrenia" sort of way but a real, magically there but invisible to  my    mundane eyes way.    Because, in so many ways, escalator-talking-guy didn't have those tell tale signs of crazy-homeless-guy.  You know, he wasn't smelly, he was wearing clean, well kept clothes, well-shaven, hair cut.   He seemed almost normal.  It's something to think about.  Next time you see someone who is talking to themselves (but not apparently on a "hands free cell phone" which has led to new kinds of crazy-talking-people, and is another story), maybe he's really a visitor from the future, with a communication device implanted in his head.  Or he's talking to a very real fairy, that, if I could see her, would be blue, and sparkly, with long silver hair and a bad attitude.    Or maybe the guy is just off his meds.

      Wow, I just realized I hadn't written in forever....sorry for that!  I've been at a conference that is here in San Antonio for once... I didn't have to travel (except through commuter traffic, which sucks).  It's a popular culture conference, which means papers on things like Harley Davidsons and the Grateful Dead.  I've spent most of my time at the Sci Fi & Fantasy papers.  I met  urlLink Suzy Charnas  yesterday (if you're a sci fi buff, you don't need me to tell you who that is.)  She was very nice, funny, and interesting.  It's always neat to meet authors where you get to talk to them more than "will you sign my book?"    Anyway, more today-- I'm heading out soon.  But I thought- wait, I haven't written in the blog in days.  So I'm saving up observations and stuff, and they will make it in here eventually.

      Last night, I had this dream that was bizarre and sort of scary.  I dreamt I found, washed up on a beach where I was swimming, dozens of plastic tourist-like items with a cityscape etched into it.  Along with the cityscape was a description, in broken English, of the various sites on the "map" of the city.  So far, this sounds like a standard weird dream, right?  The creepy part was that the skyline of this "city" was made up of the Twin Towers, prominently in the middle.  All around were tall buildings FROM OTHER CITIES in the U.S.  The Space Needle was there, and the Sears Building.  I don't remember and/or recognize others, but in the dream, I knew it was bad.  I tried to show these tourist things to other people to warn them that there was something weird, and threatening, about it.  The wording on the gadgets was suggestive-- it said things that seemed to imply that it was a tool for people planning further attacks on U.S. buildings.  I can't exactly remember what the words were, but to me, in the dream, it was obvious that these plastic tourist things were essentially training devices to teach people what buildings in the U.S. to attack.    I guess it mostly shows that etched into my subconscious around the 9/11 tragedies was a fear of other cities and tall buildings being targeted the way the World Trade Center was.  And with the war in Iraq, and world-wide opinion feeling that we're tying the war on terror into 9/11 somewhat wrongly, these fears are something that will not rest totally.  What was worse about it was that no one in the dream took my warnings seriously; they all dismissed me and said that the nick-nacks were not significant.    And even as I write this, in the climate of mistrust and finger pointing, I worry that someone would see what I've written and think that I was somehow saying something bad.  In fact, the urge is there to delete what I've just written so that no one reads it and thinks the wrong thing.  And that scares me even more than the dream-- that a silly little insignificant thing like a blog entry about a dream that horrifies me could get me "on a list" or something.

       urlLink Those commercials  on TV (usually I see them on CNN headline news) for gold investments are bizarre.  Whoever does their ads must be targeting some other demographic than me-- a very strange one, at that.  There's one that shows, while classical music plays in the background, a hand rifling through a big pile of gold coins like Scrooge.  It's a greedy image; one might even go so far as to say suggesting covetousness or even avarice (word of the day calendar, eat your heart out).  Not exactly the image I like to think of for myself, ever, and my hubby & I have a few nice little stock investments, so we could be the type that these advertisers would want to appeal to.  But these commercials don't say to me "good investment potential" they say "Hi, I'm a greedy old bastard who counts my gold coins every single day."  I even used to think, "man, even if you buy gold, you don't really get a big bag of doubloons anymore-- you get paper, still!"  but then I looked at the website.  Apparently they do send you gold coins.  If you like the image from way back & always wanted to be like those  urlLink Lethal Weapon 2  villains, you can even get Krugerrands!

      Have you ever seen   urlLink Henry & June  ?     I just finished watching the movie for the first time; I'd been interested before, but never had an opportunity to see it.  It's based on the love affair of  urlLink Henry Miller  &  urlLink Anais Nin  in the 1930s.    I have to say that this was probably the most erotic movie I've ever seen.  I don't mean cheap eroticism-- sex & naked bodies writhing around sweaty & artlessly.  There was this one scene where Anais is dancing with her husband, during the time when she's experiencing her sexual awakening, and she looks into the eyes of every man in the room and they literally seem to make love merely through their eyes.  The man may have been bored, dancing with a slow partner, but as soon as he looks into her eyes (which were gorgeous, lined like a cat and deeply innocent yet sexual) his face changes.  I think it also dealt with the many faces of eroticism so well-- Anais is sort of like a cat-- she pretty much rubs up sensuously against anyone-- male or female.  And the sex scenes weren't all muscle and wet sculpted body-- there was imperfection, and in that imperfection, incredible beauty.    Anyway.  If you've never seen this movie, I would say watch it.  But only if you're prepared to think naughty thoughts, and then feel redeemed by a sense of love and friendship in the end.

      Yes, I know, a couple of days and all of a sudden the place looks totally different.  I've been trying to fix a couple of CSS "issues" and in the process, decided to change the artwork.  So now I've gone all "Pre Raphaelite" on ya'll.  I like it!  They're all women from mythology.  If one strikes your fancy and you need to know what it is called so you can order it from an art warehouse, lemme know and I'll give you a name.    I'm thinking this could be a trend.  I was just about to spend a bunch of cash to get a professional to update the look, but I'm thinking now maybe I'll just keep doing it myself.  I like this new stuff.  Let me know if it makes the blog load terribly long.  I don't think so, but maybe....   Now I am tired.  It's been a traumatic day.

       Bad Day Alert!   I went down to order my new business cards to have for my conference attendance next week to the shopping center near my house.  While in there, for about thirty minutes or so, my car rolled out of its parking space & hit another person's truck, damaging both our bumpers a bit.  It looks really suspicious-- my car was STILL IN GEAR-- there as a tiny very mild slope.  It was in its spot when the guy whose car mine hit parked (he remembered seeing my car).  On the front drivers' bumper of my car, there is a white scuff mark paint splotch that was NOT there before.  So what really it looks like happened is someone else whacked my car a little bit and pushed it into rolling.  And THAT someone did not have the decency to sit there and wait-- which is what I did.  So now my insurance is going to have to pay for the damages.  MAYBE if the police officer who we pointed out the weird skid mark on the ground & the scuff on my bumper puts in his report that he thinks someone else hit me, I can get some payment because of the "hit and run" nature of the incident.  But it's up to him whether he puts that in there... whether he thinks that sounds like what happens.  Man oh man oh man does this SUCK!!!!!!!!    I've never in my life had anything nicer than a "college student's" starter car.  The Mistubishi is the nicest car I think I've ever even frickin' driven, and now someone comes in and bumps me and makes my car bump another and screw up both our days.    At least the guy in the truck was really nice about it.  His wife & young son had to sit in the heat and wait while the police took there time getting there.  So I feel really bad about it but it's not like I really did anything other than park my frickin' car in a reasonable place, and assured myself it was reasonably safe!!  When I was first walking out of the store with my cute little navy blue outfit I am going to wear to the conference (which was a bargain-- but has apparently cost A LOT more than the 20 bucks it initially cost-- cause if I'd have gone to my car right away and left, rather than go to the clothes store for 20 minutes, this probably wouldn't have happened) I was happy.   I saw the green car whacked into the white truck and I thought for a sec-- wow, that sucks for someone.  Then I realized, "wait.  that's MY car."  I haven't even had the damn thing long enough to recognize it as the rolling culprit!!!  Crap Crapitty Crap!!!!  So now I just don't feel like doing anything else other than lying on the couch feeling sorry for myself.  Sigh. The damage isn't really THAT bad.  But it's bad enough. It's my sweet pretty little new car!!!!!

      I worked all day (today & yesterday) on my paper & Power Point for the Popular Culture association conference next week.  I thought I'd have time for a workout, but I even forgot to eat lunch, and am now too tired to actually do anything else anyway.  But I did, in the course of my work, find two interestingly opposed websites that seem to deserve being linked together.    The first, an  urlLink anti-feminist webpage  which declares out-of-date diatribes against feminist stereotypes, which has no idea that not at all ALL feminists are these stereotypes.  And even if they were, the point would be to refute the arguments of feminism-- not to attack the people for things OTHER than logic & argument.  If I said your argument was stupid cause you were smell, hairy, and had bad breath, then that would not disprove your claim, but rather, make me look like a bigoted idiot.    Dude.  I (and many other feminists) shave, I wear a bra, and I am a feminist.  I also don't care if someone calls me a chick, or a broad.  I have long hair, unlike your claim to be able to "pick out a feminist in a crowd" because she has short hair. The absurdity of the argument that feminists are "unbathed" is also so ridiculous an  urlLink ad hominem  attack as to be funny.  I get the point that he's trying to be sort of "Shock jock" ish, and insulting people is part of that image.  Good for you.  Hate mail is fun, isn't it?  But if you're going to be anti-feminist, at least know what feminism ACTUALLY is.  You're talking about things that are SOOOO out of date and SOOOO pointless.  Feminism is the attempt to end sexism, and unfair treatment  based on gender alone .  This includes discrimination against men.  If you're being treated unfairly for reasons other than gender, then that's a different issue altogether.  And what clothes we wear or what we shave doesn't really have anything at all to do with it.  He says "It's just the way things have always been" and  "just deal with it and move on."  That's the same argument people have used to justify slavery, (it's always been that way) and poverty (just get a job and quit bitching) and any injustice out there.  Stupid people have always been paid less money than their telemarketing bosses.  Just get over it and stop bitching about it.    However, the  urlLink second   website almost proves the joker above right by living up to those feminist stereotypes of irrational silly arguments with no real leg to stand on in declaring that a long list of movies & films are misogynistic, with no really good rationale other than the idea that if a movie depicts a woman as sexy it is anti-female.  There's an absurd dis on Kim Possible explained as only "because she's a spy." Why is spying anti-female?  Females aren't all good and altruistic-- equality means equal chance to be "bad" too.     Most of the movies and TV shows are not given any real reason for being considered misogynistic, and when they are, the arguments are silly & insulting.  It makes me wonder if this isn't written by someone who ISN'T a feminist to try to parody feminist ideas to discredit feminism.  It's so over the top.    Anyway.  I got a good laugh out of each one.  I certainly am fine with both party's right to speak-- but it just goes to show a bad argument, bad rhetoric, and bad writing just aren't convincing. What did they used to say-- "Opinions are like a@@holes, everybody's got em"?  Yep. Couple of opinions on each side here.

      This morning, I was lying lazily in bed and heard a strange scuffling, whacking sound coming from the living room area.  Since the cat was on the bed at my feet, I knew it wasn't her, but ignored the noise for a little while anyway, figuring it was something on the roof (we get noisy squirrels a lot).  Finally, it was obvious that it was INSIDE (and it was also time to get up).  When I made my way to the living room, inside the skylight (we have about four of them scattered throughout the house) there was a little brown sparrow-type bird.  Again in the house.  I'm quite sure she was not in there yesterday.  So I appear to have defamed my friend K for leaving a bird in the house while I was gone unfairly.  Apparently, we are now a stop on the birdy underground railroad, hidden tunnels of access into our house SOMEWHERE.  I don't know how the heck they're getting in here.  They're pretty easy to get out-- you just open a door and make noise and wiggle around in the opposite direction to where you want them to fly-- and they smell the fresh air from the open door, or something, and head for the hills.    There are no holes I can see in any of the skylights (which would be my first guess, since the bird this morning seemed quite convinced she could get out that way). What's interesting to me about this is that mythology has birds as  urlLink messengers -- sometimes, depending on your interpretation, of good messages or bad (even to a death in the family).  In society's historical past, it wouldn't be unusual for a death to occur somewhere in one's extended family-- life is pretty hazardous, even today, and boy was it worse in the world without antibiotics (and other stuff too innumerable to list).  I remember in the movie the Seventh Seal they said something about a myth that a bird in the house was delivering a soul (so if you were looking for a new baby, it should be a good sign).  So now two birds in about three days in my house.  Message, anyone?  I just hope it's a good one.

      Did you know that if you have the "Weather Bug" program on your computer, if the temp goes above 100 degrees, the temp indicator in your little toolbar goes RED?    Well it does.  And it is DAMN HOT out here.  Summer sort of snuck up on us in Texas this year, with it staying really cool & rainy & nice for a long time.  But this weekend, it is here with a true vengeance.  And the temp is sitting in the corner of the computer glaring red at us.  So feel sorry for me, unless of course, wherever you are is worse.  Then I truly have sympathy for you.

      Three day weekends just screw up my equilibrium.  It feels like Sunday, yet it's Monday, and then the rest of the week is weird too.  Even with me not "working" outside the house, tomorrow will feel like Monday and so forth.  Pooey.              Today is another BBQ day-- this time @ a friend's house instead of over here at our place.  So aside from reading some of my new book (Bitten, which so far is pretty good-- if a little too heavy on the "oh, please, I don't want to be a werewolf" angst) I will work out, make a pasta salad of some sort to take to D&J's house, and then just socialize.  I have work to do, you know, but as I get older, it becomes less easy to get things done.  There's just too much loafing possibility in a day, you know?  And if I do too much, my newly painted fingernails will smudge.  And that, dear friends, really chafes my arse.

      I wonder-- if my husband is trying to install the cool new halogen track lighting system, and wants me to help him figure out which is wire "L" and which is wire "N", and I call my neighbor and ask him to come over an help, in exchange for a beer or two, does that mean that I've done the wifely duty?  Cause I know enough to know I am  not   a qualified electrician (nor is my spouse-- but he is a male, so figures that is qualification enough).  But NOT having a Y chromosome guarantees that I know when to call someone else to help.    However, perhaps having two males who know less about it than they think they do will be a bad idea.  We'll see.  I do have the speed dial all set for "911."    On another note, we watched  urlLink  Bubba Ho-Tep   last night.  It is definitely a "must watch" if you like "quirky" movies.  I liked it a lot, and pat myself on the back for movie night choices.  (They were all out of  Pitch Black .)

      I recently had someone send me this email, which I won't reproduce in its entirety, but it's got some funny "new words" which I think are sort of cool.  The ones I really like are:   MOUSE POTATO:  The on-line, wired generation's answer to the couch potato.  404:  Someone who's clueless. (From the World Wide Web error message "404 Not Found," meaning that the requested document could not be located.)  I can really relate to the "mouse potato" one-- sometimes, it seems that you can just kill sooooo much time mousing around the internet, looking at say, cute  urlLink Hallmark card characters , or reading hours and hours of  urlLink Get Fuzzy  cartoon strips.  (I really love Bucky the cat, who sort of reminds me of a friend's cat, Hao Tze).    Anyway.  I read on  urlLink Debra Gallant's blog  that a good way to get shameless traffic directed to your blog is to post cat pictures.  So here is my shameless attempt to sucker people in:  Tituba, eating dinner and looking slightly annoyed that I'm disturbing her.  I feel like such paparazzi!         Then, there's a picture that I took at my LakeFest party (about two weeks ago) that I really like.  In it, everyone is doing something slightly "odd."  See what I mean?      You sort of have to examine the picture closely to pick out the oddness.  I didn't announce the photo op, so it's not posed.  And the only really "odd" thing about the hug in the center is that it was sort of in the middle of a fast dance song, and they apparently spontaneously hugged.  So.  And the blonde girl's knee position is the odd part of hers-- and then, despite the look on his face, the guy in the front is NOT mentally challenged.  (Well.  Not in any "official" way.)  Maybe I'll post more party pictures eventually.  (See.  Now I even go with a cliffhanger.  I'm just smokin' today).    After a good hard-core bike ride with my cool workout mix CD (mentioned earlier as the  urlLink lawn mowing mix ), there is a lasagna in the future, and some bruschetta, and wine, and maybe a big giant yummy salad.  I think we're also going to watch the movie  urlLink  Pitch Black  --since I never got around to seeing it, and it looks okay, and its sequel, coming out soon ( urlLink  Riddick  ) looks sort of potetial-ish.  So that's Saturday in my world.  It's no party-girl  Sex in the City  esque romp.  But it'll do for me.

       OH WOW!  IF you have Rhapsody, totally do a search for the  urlLink Arnold Schwarzenegger Total Body Workout  album.  It includes Arnold talking through the music taking you through a workout to songs such as:  1.  Save The Overtime For Me    2. Don't Stop Believin'    3. 867-5309/Jenny    4. Let Your Body Rock   5. Love Not War    6. Think I'm In Love    7. I'm So Proud    8. Save The Overtime For Me    9. It's Raining Men    10. Let Your Body Rock    11. Love Not War    12. Burning For You    13. I'm So Proud     Amazon's version has a few short clips.  But you totally have to hear this.

      I don't know why it is.  It must be the Irish DNA or something-- but I really think Conan is cute!  Even though logically, there is no reason to think so.  He's not Brad Pitt, or anything one could traditionally call cute.  He also looks just like all the red-headed boys who used to make fun of me as I was a little girl. (For some reason, there are a lot of them in my past-- tormenting me for one reason or another.  Ironically, I ended up married to one of them but that's another story).  So I just got done watching the early morning "Late Night" that is on Comedy Central.  Now it's time to clean my messy house.     Bellydance?  Anyone?   But, in the meantime, I had  urlLink promised a long time ago  to post a picture of myself in my new bellydance costume.  I finally got the pix from Sam's yesterday, and will post a picture.  It's the only one I got, and it was stupidly AFTER I danced for an hour so my hair is all messed up.  So it's not the best photo at all, but it's alls I got right now.  When my bellydance teacher gets back from her summer vacation, I hope to get her to take some studio photos-- she's a great photographer.  But here I am.   The top is a little off-kilter-- when I tried for the "s curve" body pose, it wiggled over, and you get that big black underneath top part.  I've figured out how to fix that since then.   :)  urlLink  Click  for a larger version.     *hee hee.  spellcheck wants to change Conan to "cowman."  Oh spellcheck, you silly kidder.

      Okay.  For two weeks (till June 9th-ish) there will be  urlLink this talking animated Kim  at the Bud Light "Making Faces" site.  I have to say I find it both really cool and a bit creepy. Make some of yourself and you'll see what I mean.  Look at that gleam in my eye!  Hear me sounding like a computer!  Wonder why I spent so much time perfecting it!  And why my lips are a little squeezed....  Who thought this thing up?

      At some point, I will have to make it to the gym for exercise today.  Andrew is definitely going to force me into a joint bike ride/jog this afternoon, and I ought to go to the 11:00 aerobics class.  But my main plan for today is to get my women writers site finished and posted.  One project, a joint interview between three blogs and myself, will probably not be done today, but the rest can be almost ready. I just really dread reading the poetry that has been submitted because so much of it is terrible and I hate rejecting the sensitive types who send it in, but no frickin' way am I posting some of that poetry.  ::Shivers at thought of bad poetry::  Look around; I've added a few new features to the blog-- a list of my favorite "archived" blogs, as well as a new set of daily rotating banner graphics.  When I say I procrastinate, I mean it, dammit.

       Landing in Dallas: Looking out as the plane hovers closer and closer to the ground at the layers of spotty clouds around us.  There is a sheet of rain just to the left of the plane that literally falls in a wedge to the ground, plastering one area of town while the rest seems clear.  Once we get there, the runway and parking lots near the airport are slick with rainwater, but no drops are falling.  As we pass over a lake, we can see tiny white specks of birds against the blue green of the water and whitecaps appearing briefly and then gone.  You wouldn't think you could see the birds from so far up, but there they are, and you can make out the pattern of flight as they swoop and fall on wind currents, using the same principals of flight that keep your small airplane afloat.    A perfect circle of a little neighborhood, white streets etched into the green grass around, and a "t" of a cross street dissecting the circle.  Matchbox cars, trucks, a big trailer park-- they are so tiny as to not look real, but you imagine the people still sleeping (it is very early in the morning, still, and you've been up for hours) or moving about their morning routine groggily.    For just a second, a single spear of lightning pierces the layer of rain to the left of the plane.  It is far enough away to be unthreatening to your tiny plane, but startling in its vivid white line.    As I looked out the window as we began to come nearer to the ground, gravity starting to feel stronger and pull the engines into a higher pitch, I spotted a marquee digital sign, seemingly far away from the huge parking lot where it sat, and it flashed a message, readable from the air, saying "Welcome Back."  It almost was speaking to me, I felt-- like that magic traffic advisory sign in the movie  urlLink L.A. Story  and I couldn't help but smile and feel personally welcomed.  After four days with my very "smoker" oriented family, and me a very "non-smoker", I am happy to be "almost back" because the cigarette smoke still clings to my hair, and clothes, and I can't wait to be smoke free again.  They are considerate, and try to limit the cigarettes when I am in an enclosed spaces with them, but it still makes my head pound to be there.   There were guys on the early morning plane, a small one with probably about 20 seats, tops, who were snotty and thought it was very funny to mock the flight attendant's safety briefing.  They had tons of luggage clustered around their feet and she told them they had to move these bags because the row must be clear.  They acted like they couldn't wait the five minutes (tops) it takes to get one's bags at the planeside and it was such an inconvenience to put their bags somewhere other than at their feet.  To me, it is much more uncomfortable to sit for an hour and a half with one's feet on one's luggage, and I hate trying to wrestle my carry on in and out of the overhead bins.  But these guys thought they were the cleverest fellas in history-- mocking the info about how to fasten the seatbelts and how the drop down oxygen system would work.  Of course we all know how to use a seatbelt, idiots.  But the briefing is there because in a survivable emergency, the only things you're going to remember are those things that are so drilled into your head that it is rote memory that you perform the actions that save your life.  It's like people who crash into bodies of water (like a lake) in their car and die because they can't get out-- only because they forget to remove their seatbelts in their panic.    But then there was the friendly older gentleman, leaning against a short wall, and when I got to the gate, a little rushed and needing breakfast, to find that I had plenty of time cause the plane was not loading yet after all, who smiled and said in his gruff voice "It's like the Army; hurry up and wait."    And the simple joy of getting a strawberry yogurt layered with granola and fresh fruit to take with me on the flight.  And a cup of fresh morning coffee with two Splendas and two half n halfs.    Watching the hopping brown sparrows with nests in the eaves of the airport who swoop at the windows and peck the ground near the planes, to be chased off by harried baggage handlers.  Original aviators who like the airport as home instead of the green of a suburban tree bank.    The pretty, constantly smiling flight attendant, with short curly hair and chocolate smooth skin, who could have been a model and seemed genuinely happy to be there and whose eyes crinkled each time she spoke-- true joy in life that is so much more genuine than the sarcastic mocking of the (earlier mentioned) passengers from the seat behind.    The crankiness and constantly loud phone conversation of a pair of businessmen near the back of the plane who can't even take 35 minutes of flight between Dallas and San Antonio to rest and think of things other than the meeting ahead.    Most of all, the pleasure in Andrew's voice that I was already almost home when I called him from my seat (2C).     Glad to be home, and having traveled too much lately-- the novelty of constant flight is worn a little thin, and the same time that I can still find something new and interesting each time.

      We went to New Orleans for a while today-- my sister had a job interview & I went along for road trip company.  It's sort of funny to go to New Orleans and not do anything wild.  Our big wildest moment was having cajun food at the Riverwalk Mall. Wooooh!!!  Lots of walking back and forth between the two nice hotels she might work at eventually.  It was really hot & muggy, and it's very different when you can't retire to your hotel room & a comfy bed for the afternoon lull.  Or you can't carry around a gallon of frozen beverage while walking around.    So tomorrow, I'm on my way home.  I shouldn't have too much trouble getting a flight-- and I'll be home by 1-ish.  That, however, means I have to be at the airport at about 5:45.  Blech.  So while you're nestled in your own comfy beds in the morning, perhaps getting up temporarily for a visit to the porcelain fairies, think kindly of me sitting on a cramped airplane on my way home.  I'll wave as I go over your houses....

      What did Kim do today in sunny sunny Florida?   Went to the beach with my sister. Rented one of those "beach chairs" with the comfy cushions & an umbrella stand from two cute pre-cabana boys (remind me to tell you one day about my cabana boy plan) drank 2 Bushwackers (remind me to tell you about Bushwackers-- the frozen tasty beverage) bought a cute sarong thingy to wear around my bikini biker shorts ate at this cool seafood place; fed some crab claws to this cute cute raccoon who came begging got a nice bit of freckly sun on my nose and shoulders am about to take an after sun nap   That's about it.  Headed to New Orleans tomorrow.  Yes.  We'll see if it means "getting home" or "another day of shenanigans."

      I'm in Florida. What What What?  "How did that happen?," you say.  Well, the plan was to go to Mississippi for my niece's high school graduation, then blast out of there this morning back home to Texas.  Well, the airline decided not to cooperate with my fabulous plans.  Actually, it's not so much the airline as all the inexplicably flying around on the airline on a weekday people who are sitting in seats that ought to be reserved for my lazy butt.  Why are all you folks in the cities I want to get out of?!?  So, not being able to get on any of the flights I wanted to get on, I went with my sister to Florida, where I am now tippity typing away, needing a coffee & some breakfast (she's not a big cook and is on a grocery shopping strike and a cleaning strike too.....).  She does, however, have the generosity to loan me her car to go GET said coffee and breakfast but I am apparently on a "I'm too damn lazy to move" strike.    So.  It's a quandary.  A quagmire, shall we say.    I predict being home maybe tomorrow.  Andrew wants me home, and I really have stuff to do, but there is the beach.  "That   is   an existential dilemma," you say?  Yes.  Yes it is.

      My poor little sportycar is fixed-- her boo boo on the back driver's side from the accident is painted & buffed & you can barely tell that there was an  urlLink accident of bizarre proportions .  The tail light still has a tiny nick in the corner-- and she's wiser about who she hangs out with now and puts on "the break" in relationships with big white pickup trucks now.  :)  (Sorry. The metaphor just kept going).  Whodathunkit that my cute navy blue suit that cost 20 bucks, that was the reason I was at the shopping center in the first place would end up costing me about 700 bucks?  Sigh.    On another note-- I'm headed to pick up photos from the past month-ish.  I really need to take my digital camera into the shop.  Oneathesedays.  But maybe later you'll get a photo essay "what Kim's been up to lately-- a picture is worth a thousand blogs".    For yet another-- I'm working on a project for my women writers zine interviewing a couple of bloggers.  I haven't decided who all I want to work on, or what questions I'm going to ask.  I want to talk to a couple of bloggers I read regularly who specifically center their blogs on feminism in some way.  It's a project that could be very big-- really, one could probably do a whole dissertation on it-- but this will just be a short (ish) article.  It ought to be interesting.    But off to work and cruise around in my green sportscar and blast music too loud.  I think maybe some "Lil' Kim" would be great.  (Man, putting her name in the blog is going to get me some more weird search hits....)

      Two of my best friends are heading for New York City today.  They are "in flight" right now.  This morning (at a gaspingly early 5:30 AM!) I took them to the airport.  Aaron looked all "meterosexual" in his nice black silk shirt & khaki pants, and  of course , Nissa always looks  loverly .  So if you see them, and you're a New Yorker, say "Hi from Kim."  I got them doughnuts from Krispy Kreme-- they have a New York Cheesecake flavor-- on the way to take them to the airport, in a vain attempt to boost the cool factor of my souvenir.  They'll think "wow, this ::insert coolest souvenir ever:: is a little more than I was going to pay, but then, she DID bring us those doughnuts."  Mwah ha ha ha ha.  My evil plan is in play.  And, like a true evil genius, I have revealed it way too soon and now will probably get a snow globe of Donald Trump's haircut.  (But then, what if that's what I want?  Hmmmmm?)  One thing I'm secretly hoping for is the   urlLink Tiffany's Guide to Table Manners for Teens   (in a blue Tiffany's bag, of course!!) But then, I'm not sure they're going to the holy of holies while there.  I know I'm not a teen, but I love this book.    Back to the old grind on the  urlLink Women Writers Summer Issue .  It's about halfway done now.  Yay!  I rock the house man.  I'll obviously tell you when all the new book reviews & stuff are posted.  But you can look at it now, too.  It's cool.  Yeah.  But then, maybe you're not ready for it... (more reverse psychology.... how I love my evil ways.... don't let the mere 29% evil score in the sidebar fool you).

      Okay.  I believe I now have Haloscan's comments fixed and added to my blog again.  I left the "blogger enabled" comments on those entries that had them (last week-ish till today) so there might be some temporary confusion on how to comment.  But from this post on, it should be clear where to do it.  (I said do it.  HuhHuh.  Huh. Huh.)

      Wanna know the ultimate, cardio fabulous mix for lawn mowing and getting a cardio vascular heart-pumped workout?  As a trained fitness professional, I am here to give you the "skinny".  :)   This mix works you out great if you: Don't give a crap what your neighbors think and dance while mowing whenever the mood strikes.  Seriously.  Dance.  Wiggle your butt while lawn mowing. Push the mower as fast as you possibly can, with as few stops as possible. Sing along (or at least quietly lip sinc the words as they go).  This last step increases your cardio vascular impact significantly, so if you don't know the songs, learn them.     Here is the Mix, direct from me to you.        Come Baby Come-- K7  White Wedding-- Billy Idol  Superfreak-- Rick James  Push It-- Salt N Pepa  Bitch-- Meredith Brooks  Housequake-- Prince (from the Sign O' the Times album)*  Blister in the Sun-- Violent Femmes  Celebrity Skin-- Hole  Wild Horses-- The Sundays  99 Red Balloons-- Goldfinger (important to get this version, not Nena's-- Goldfinger rocks it more)  Banditos-- The Refreshments  You Dropped a Bomb on Me-- The Gap Band  My Adidas-- Run DMC  In Da Club-- 50 Cent  Goin Back to Cali-- LL Cool J (Ladies Love Cool J!)  Musicology-- Prince  Brick House-- The Commodores  Volcano Girl-- Veruca Salt  My Sharona--The Knack   The only bad things are when your "earbud" headphones fall out of your ears.  Or you can't figure out how to use your husband's damn gas powered edger.  Or when a big giant spider, fleeing the mower, freaks and almost jumps on you, causing you to choke the lawnmower and lose your grove.  The good things:  you will be majorly sweaty if your lawn is as big as mine is (not really all that big).  I was "done" with the lawn part by My Adidas-- and the rest is the "edger mix".    This mix could, of course, be applied to other tasks.  It's a really groovin' list, right here for you in our studios tonight.    *Amazing spellchecker adventures here:  how does blogger spell check NOT have the word Blog in it, but does have "hoosegow"-- which it suggested instead of Housequake?  Hmmm?

      Do you think I can convince my husband that the cat was the culprit, if I go out to Sam's, buy a brand new cool ass laptop for myself, and then say "I dunno where it came from, but  urlLink you think you can trust your cat ...."  (play track 7)  A new laptop would be so wonderful.  Since my old one will no longer charge its battery back up and so is not really a "laptop" in the portable sense.  I have to be near a plug to let it work.    Just a thought.  If you have ideas of how to convince the hubby IT'S TIME, let me know.  I think if I tie it into the dissertation getting done, he'll definitely go for it.

      The International Olympic Committee ruled that  urlLink post-operative transsexuals  can compete in the Olympics, provided a long set of criteria have been met.  This is a really interesting issue-- and transsexuals have been trying to get people to recognize them as a group  urlLink deserving of equal rights , instead of the butt of jokes, for many years.  In grad school, one of my favorite books was  urlLink Gender Outlaw  by Kate Bornstein.  One of the issues brought up by the news story above was that women who were formerly men might have an advantage in a sports competition over "natural born" women.  I hadn't thought of that one, and I wonder if it would be really a consideration at all.  Do the hormones that transsexuals take to become female change their body chemistry enough that they would have corresponding changes in physical strength?  Transsexuals are not men in drag-- they have significant changes in their bodies, and many of them looked very slight and petite for men in the first place (part of their reasons for changing is often that they feel they were born in the wrong body.)  This isn't intended as a jokey entry-- I'm actually sort of interested in how this will play out.  Would team members know a woman used to be a man?  Are there a bunch of transsexual athletes out there?  Obviously, if the committee had to make a rule on it, there's at least one who has been agitating to compete.  Do people with more expertise on the human body out there than me have opinions on this?  Biology, folks?  Seriously.  Tell me what you think.    On a less serious note, later today I'm going to drop off all the film for events in the last month that I've promised to post pictures for.  I'm going to get a "photo disc" for them since my scanner is also currently out of commission.  So any good ones I'll post here soon.  But I do have a ton of work to do this week-- I need to publish my  urlLink women writers zine  (my goddess of a  urlLink Co-editor  has been working an amazing amount to get us 30-something book reviews for this issue.)  And this weekend I'm going to my niece's high school graduation in Mississippi.  And at some point today, I need to figure out the code to put up the old comments system.  I hate getting "anonymous" posts-- I want to KNOW my fans.  :)    So I'm going to be busier than a one-legged man in a butt kicking contest today.    Let the butt kicking begin!!

      Riding off into the sunset sucks.  Seriously.  Today, we left Shreveport at about 3:30 pm, driving almost due West for many hours.  The sun beat down mercilessly (thank you cliche-fairy) and the puffs of cloud did not offer any respite from the bright light.  And, driving into the sunset means that it lasts forever.  I felt like I must be getting a sunburn through the safety glass-- and I know my "botox area" (the squinty wrinkles above my forehead) was etched ever more deeply (since I forgot my sunglasses-- situation normal for me).    Events of the weekend:  * saw a cute, "nutbrown bunny rabbit" eating clover happily, stretching in a way that I thought only cats did * heard more news on the family "scandal front"-- both good & bad (the bad for one member being good for the rest of us in the long run) * found that I can now do 70 pounds on the low row machine at the gym, without straining.  Hello Big German Genes. * wrote a few more pages on the dissertation-- probably crap, but then.... * found a really cool "pig lighter" whose "flames" shoot out the nostrils of its little pink face when you push on his red hat.  You refill said pig lighter with his big  urlLink petard  area.  It was too priceless to NOT buy. * gasped "Holy Crap" as Andrew avoided what would have been a really bad icky poo accident just outside of Austin involving an 18 wheeler.  Looked up from my reading (I read aloud to him as he drives-- we're halfway through bestseller brain candy ( urlLink Angels & Demons ) to see us pop deftly into the lane wherein the 18 wheeler was NOT skidding to a complete frucking stop right in front of us.  Gosh I love that man o' mine.  Q1  *Tituba was not completely thrilled, nor completely bummed out with the trip. She is now sniffing everything in the house to verify that noone touched it while she was gone.  "Lighten up Francis."  Q2   I'm sure I'll think of more things to add, eventually, but for now, that'll do, donkey. Q3    So for now...to bed.  And more reading aloud till we're done with the book.  It makes my voice sound like I've been drinking whisky and/or smoking.     Extra bonus points for the person who correctly identifies the three movie quotes (Q1 and Q2 and Q3) in previous post.

      Oh, and we're going to Shreveport for Andrew's drill weekend this afternoon, so there will be several days of no posts (unless I can find a way to do so up there, but so far I haven't.)  Tituba is coming with, so no worries there.    Also, when I get back, I plan to figure out how to make the old comment system work on the new template, again.  It wasn't working, so I have been using the blogger-supplied one, but apparently it won't let you post except as anonymous if you aren't a blogger member-- which is super-mondo irritating.  So I'm going back to Haloscan, but need time to fiddle with it.    Have a great weekend, beeyatches.  (Disclaimer:  Last sentence inspired by Snoop Dogg-- not meant as insult).

       Two points today:   Point 1.   Last night I had a dream that I was searching the mall I frequently dream about (it's a mythic mall-- with lots of floors, escalators and a giant food court-- I've dreamt about it in various ways since I was about 13) for a special blank journal book to write in.  Generally when I dream about "the mall" it's a signal that I'm searching for something (duh) and usually it's something vague-- I'm shopping for a special outfit (formal) often, or sexy undergarments*.  But this time I was looking for a pretty journal blank book because I wanted to write a journal.    I knew in the dream that I had this blog, but apparently in my dream I was also aware that I don't want to write everything in this public forum, and wanted to write about the things that I won't write about here.  Of course, I wasn't finding the book that I wanted.  I found one with a pretty cover but it had very small spaces for writing-- and I'm way too long winded for that.  As soon as I woke up, I knew that if I really wanted this kind of thing I had to go to one of the big chain bookstores-- they have gorgeous blank books at those stores.  But in real life, I've bought those kinds of books several times & hardly ever end up writing in them.  I kept a journal pretty religiously back when I was a young college student/senior in high school.  But since then, most of my writing has been formal academic stuff.  Anyway.    The whole point is to think about my writing desires, my "flow" and purpose in writing down these comments for a slightly larger audience every day.  Apparently, what I write does attract some folks who think I'm funny, or interesting, or whatever.  I've had commenters say things like "Surely you already have a book published that I could read."  Aside from the obvious support of Mom (hi Mom) and family & friends, there are complete strangers who tune in to see how I "turn a phrase" and/or what's happening in my life most days.  Maybe many of them are still just wondering if I'll ever get my dissertation written (hey, that could be my superhero quest-- I'm  ABD GIRL  whose superpower is AVOIDANCE!!! And I can't wait to get the tights and go-go boots for my costume).  But clearly, my subconscious has something to say about my writing.  The stuff I really love is this semi-autobiographical, sometimes a bit confessional stuff here in the "blog."  Why didn't I do my dissertation on that, dammit?!  (Short answer: blogs weren't very popular yet back when I had to decide on the topic.)     Point 2:   and more fun.  A week or so ago, I noticed this new song being promoted on Rhapsody.  It was called "Redneck Woman" by  urlLink Gretchen Wilson .  I listened and thought-- "Yes.  This is the next Shania Twain style "country girl power" anthem.  Apparently I was right.  Wilson is on CNN Headline news this morning; her song is "racing up the charts"; and yet, as far as I can tell, she still doesn't even have an album out yet.  (You can hear the song if it's not playing on the website by forwarding the "CD Control at the top of the screen.  You can also watch the video if you just log in.  It's pretty cool; has Kid Rock & Tanya Tucker & Hank Williams Jr. in it).    Now, I am not exactly a "Redneck woman"*# but I grew up primarily in the South and I like the song a lot.  It's fun, and it sings a positive empowering message about what is essentially the "low maintenance regular woman."  I can get with that.  And I say "Ya'll" all the time, and "I'm fixin' to eat breakfast."  (The first you probably know, but if you're not from the South you may not understand what "I'm fixin'" means.  It means "I'm preparing to" or "I'm getting ready to" or "I'm about to").    These two posts relate to each other in  no way at all.   If I were a better writer, I could think of some sort of clever tie-in between them, and you'd end this (rather long-winded) post-reading session with a smile at my wry clever humor in comparing two disparate things.  But instead of that, I'm left here with my pajamas on, my reading glasses smudged, and my latte getting cold, at a loss for how to end this.  So, then I'll just stop writing.  After all, I'm fixin' to get some writing done on my dissertation.      *I use this old-fashioned way of describing it to try to head off creepy search term phrases.... we'll see if that works.    **Means "All But Dissertation"-- that and a phone card will get you a phone call.  It sort of sounds like ADD, though.  To which, in a way, it is quite similar.   *#I was born in Illinois, after all, and am not Southern by birth. I'm also not the "plain old country girl" who doesn't "sip champagne" that the song exalts. And, as an academic "ivory tower" dwelling intellectual, I've quite clearly attempted to move out of the trailer park.  (but I did  urlLink live in them  most of my youth).  But I married a Texan, and I can cook up real southern food and I think cowboys are sexy even when they're dirty & smelly.  And I like grits.  So-- an enigma wrapped in a mystery.  And I think it's hilarious that spellchecker wants to change "Ya'll" to Yale.  Snort.  Chuckle.  Bellylaugh.

      No doubt this entry is going to get me a bunch of strange hits on my statistics for search phrases that get to the site, but I just don't care.  There's this commercial I saw this morning on TV where you see these men dancing around, doing little "victory dances" while Queen's " urlLink We are the Champions " plays.  At first, you think, what, another Geico commercial?  And then, it comes.  (Sorry for the bad pun).  It's a commercial about how if you buy a certain amount of prescriptions of Viagra, you get the next one free.  They show the sort of rejoicing usually reserved for the ends of Great Wars or even a Dr. Pepper commercial.  At the very end, there is a woman spinning happily with (presumably) her husband. (I don't know why I presume that; it could as easily be her next door neighbor-- I mean, there's even a Commandment about that one, therefore, precedent.)     Vive la phallogocentric media!   (Yes.  Very few people will get that joke.  But whoa, it's really, really, really funny.)

      I just added a guestmap!  You know, one of those little things you can poke a "pin" into and say where you're from?  It's way down on the bottom right in that little column, which I hope is showing up on everyone's browser.  Sign in!  Make me feel lurved.    Also, I just got a nasty chill down my spine (an icky, ew, scary, one).  I was looking at the profile things that blogger folks have kindly installed and saw this picture of a guy that looks terribly like an ex-boyfriend.  The name on the profile is  not  his.  But it's sort of creepy.  I never actually worried about that in the past, but what if he found my blog and posted something here?  I have all these pictures of myself, and I don't look that different from when evil ex and I dated.  It's not like someone could find where I am based on the info here, for a number of reasons.  It would be difficult to find my phone number even; even with the full name which is readily available.  But eep eek eepity!  I have a big wonderful husband who would gladly bury ex-boyfriend in a large pit (and a friend with a house in the country and a shovel.)    But still.  Maybe I will stop looking at profiles.  But I find it fun to look at people who like the same books/movies/music that I do!

      I wonder how many blog entries I've titled bleah?  I could look, but maybe I'll do it later.  (procrastination being the key here.)    But it is the most appropriate title I can think of because today  is  a bleah day if ever there was one.  It's rainy, and "weather bug" keeps flashing at me warning me of possible flooding.  I worked out this morning, and had a good lunch.  I haven't fixed the glitch that yesterday made my cute little "witchy women" border that used to be on the left not overlap text, so for now, we're plain vanilla.  But now I need to get a little work done on the dissertation before Andrew's head pops off.   On other news, I have two (count them ladies and gents, two) relatives by marriage (in other words, they aren't blood relations, which makes me feel slightly better about it, but sad that blood relations married the wankers) who have very recently gotten into trouble with the law.  One of them is in serious your-ass-is-going-to-be-growng-mushrooms-cause-they're-going-to-lock-it-away-in-a-dark-room-trouble, and the other is less serious but serious enough--he isn't in jail, but definitely needs (and has) an attorney.    I heard about the one who is in jail's issue when I called home on Mother's Day.  What a fun conversation that was!  Other things came up in the discussion which, on another day, would have make my blood pressure go up, but with the whole criminal activity thing, the things that would have bugged me about the rest of the conversation went fairly un-noticed (I didn't even remember to tell Andrew about the "smaller" things till today, in fact.)     It's all so very "Jerry Springer."   Then, this weekend, while at the lakehouse, I found this board game called Ghetto.  No, it's NOT the  urlLink Monopoly -based game causing all the  urlLink controversy , although I think that based on what I saw with the game info, another company (if the one that created the 1969 version of the game) has a case for suing the guy in charge of Ghettopoly.  As I said, it was put out in 1969, by a company called "Educational Games" or something like that.  It's got a lot of interesting elements for a serious study on race relations-- I mean, it's got these profiles of people you "play" and cards like "hustler" and "work opportunity".  The people in the game have various "rap sheets" and the scoring has something to do with 1. making money (any old way you can) and 2. staying out of jail.  I was amazed that someone had bought the game, and I wonder if it was bought cause they thought it would be funny, or were aware of how bizarre the game was.  But it really made me want to steal it, because one of the things I do is teach on race relations and minority literatures.  And it would be an incredible find, research wise, to write about.  So I may have to steal it.  At least it fits the spirit of the game, right?  Somehow, this keeps running through my head:  "There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,Than are dreamt of in your philosophy." --From  urlLink Hamlet  (I, v, 166-167)

      So I should have a nap.  Later tonight I'm taking a CPR recertification course.  So if you're planning to have a heart attack, wait till tomorrow.    I am obsessed with the new blogger profiles.  I keep adding interests, and then looking at other people who share similar interests.  I envision whole new worlds and communities forming here.  And some of them are going to be creepy communities.  But none of mine are.  :)

      Okay, the blogger folks have provided new templates that don't require nearly the amount of editing that I previously did to get the fine look we had before.  But there do still seem to be a few little glitches-- some paragraph line spacing issues, and I think I may have lost my old comments system.  But that's allright, since there weren't many days with lots of comments.  Now I have the blogger comment system set up, so I won't have to pay someone else for it, which is all good.  :)    So.

      Hey, this is groovy.  Blogger has put together a new bunch of options.  My "profile" is located  urlLink here .    And I think, inspired by Estella's new design frenzy & my desire to not have my tables on the right all disappear into nothingness if you're not using the correct browser (if you're saying, what table, what links, then you're not using the browser that lets you see them.  Scroll waaaaaaaay down).  I might change my template a bit too.  We'll see.

      The trouble with a big giant party is that when it's over you have to clean up after it.*  And at the lakehouse, one must be very particular in a way you don't have to be at home cause it's not your own place-- and one of the owners/Andrew's relatives will have a fit if it's not perfect.  So I spent a bunch of yesterday cleaning up, changing sheets, scrubbing the three toilets, and then when we got home, Andrew invited his parents & Uncle to our place for dinner (which meant I had to clean up a bit here, too).  It was a lovely grilled salmon, some really tasty asparagus and a pasta salad.  AND TOO MANY glasses of wine for me, since I didn't really drink at the party --I had a raging headache so despite the presence of a margarita machine & therefore easy access to a favorite tasty beverage, I drank mostly water.  So thanks to the inept logic of "if I didn't drink at the party, I ought to help hubby finish this entire giant bottle of red-wine"--this morning I have a hangover.  It reminds me of that scene in School of Rock where it goes:  Jack Black's character: "I have a hangover, do you know what that means?" Cute Kid: "It means you're drunk!" JB's Character: (sarcastically) "NO.  It means I was drunk YESTERDAY."   So I don't feel so good.  And the cat is having fits cause I'm typing and not feeding her.  So.  That's about it for now.  I am now going to stumble into the kitchen, make myself a latte with our new fancy shmancy espresso machine & feed the cat.  Then I will sit on the couch and contemplate stupidity.  (My own).    Maybe watch some "E" since they often have stupidity on there.     And, since this (liquor) is the theme of this post, I am putting in writing that this is the first day of my 6 weeks of  detox diet plan .  Which means NO liquor AT ALL for six weeks.  Which I did last year, and first heard about Oprah Winfrey doing as a sort of workout bootcamp (I think for the Emmys or Oscars or something).  Oprah apparently lost 30 pounds doing it.  I lost about 15ish or maybe 20 doing it last year (it doesn't mean the alcohol is the only thing-- but it helps boost the metabolism a  bit, and then you don't also do stupid things like eat an entire cheesecake while drinking).  And exercising every day is the biggest reason for losing weight.  So I'll hopefully get down to the fighting weight I was at earlier this year.  Bleah.  And by overdoing it yesterday, it is TOTALLY a relief to contemplate not having anything to drink for that long.  I don't, clearly, deserve the privilege if I'm such a doofus in drinking.      *And yes, big giant party was a blast...I'll post about it when I'm feeling less like a stupid hungover jerk.

      Today we're going out to the house at Canyon Lake for a blow-out, no-holds-barred (what the hell does that mean?) anniversary/Andrew's birthday/Andrew's coming home/Ocho de Mayo/summer rocks before it goes to 100 degrees in the shade in Texas party.  (I should say Par-tay).  Many people will be coming.  You're all invited.  (If you're wise enough to the ways of google that you figure it out, you're welcome to come.  But remember-- we do have firearms-- it's part of the party plan).*  What does this mean to you, my dear blogger fan public?  Yes. Another two day absence from my witty witty ways.  I know.  Just give yourself a moment.  You'll be okay.  Maybe take a valium or something.   What does this mean for me?  Well.  Considering that:      we hired a band    we hired a margarita machine    we will have two (count them-- two) kegs of beer    we will feed the &quot;tame&quot; deer till they burst    the tame deer will probably be either vaguely disturbed by the lamb roasting on a spit (yes, the Greeks are coming) or line  up with plates saying &quot;hey-- is that Charlie? lemme have a little leg, please).  It means a wild, wild weekend.  Possibly with singing and marshmallows around the campfire later.    I got up early this morning so that I could read all my favorite blogs, comment profusely in a couple of them, and then go shopping for "supplies."  Un-named girl-friend is bringing condoms, so I guess I don't need to get any of those.  (Whoa.  That just made it sound like an entirely different type of party.  No.  I'm leaving it in there.  But it's not actually "that kind of party."  Especially since I assume the condoms are for her personal use and not mine.  Well. This is just getting worse.  I should really consider deleting this part.  But no.  Leaving it in there).    So now, I leave to put in contacts and head to the grocery store.  Should I wake up surprise one-day-only houseguest Keval and make him shop with me?   And then, to give you something to think about, inspired by  urlLink this post ( sort of) (since blogger doesn't allow trackbacks, scroll down till you find the post called your ass is not a hovercraft).  QUERY:  If you have more than one bathroom in your house, is there one particular one where you "prefer to do your business?"  Or do you use either indiscriminately, whichever is closer?    Enquiring minds wanna know.     *not really.  but it has been part of previous parties.   Liquor and ammo.  What a way to say "I love you."

      So much of writing is "I want."  I want to convince you of the political injustice of the world, and my way to fix it.  People always say "I want you"-- for sex, love, lust, life.  We are like birds, singing in the trees-- the songs so mysterious to us but which bird watchers hear as "I want" or violent warning to others.  In  urlLink Dead Poet's Society , the teacher said the point of poetry was to "woo women."  To be wooed.  The women in that movie were very much objects to be won, to watch as the romantic poets beat their drums and posed like bright birds.  But even with this "object" role, I wanted to be the teacher-- not the wooed, not the students.  But that, my dears, is another kind of wooing.  To teach, to woo.    Again-- "I want."  As I write my dissertation, academic, sometimes dry jargon and posing and lots of chest beating, it is another kind of "I want."  And all the time, others are, like those birds being challenged in the nearby trees, beating out their wants, singing out their needs and desires.  And my ear does not always do a great job of tuning OUT those insistent songs, those cries to be seen, heard.  I too am attracted by bright red or azure feathers and lovely songs.   But then again, maybe I just came down with a bad case of poetry.  I hear it's going around.

      So if you were listing the songs that should make it on your "all time" soundtrack, what would they be, and why?  Not just the songs you currently like/love/hate, but the ones that have meant something to you for a long time?  Mine follow.  In no particular order.    urlLink Don't You Forget About Me :  Simple Minds  This song is important to me for so many reasons.  Any time it comes on the radio, I must turn it up very loudly and sing it equally loudly.  Funnily enough, I don't own a copy of it (something I ought to rectify).  The reason I love this song is simple-- when I was a teen, for some reason, many people always said I looked like Molly Ringwald.  (I don't think I did-- it was just that I had red hair and freckles).  The first couple of times, it was sort of cool.  But then when I got it for the millionth time, it was old.  But it sort of led to a lifelong obsession I have with identifying "what celebrity the person I just met looks like".  Which I once saw on Oprah as a good way to be a better eyewitness to a crime (what celebrity did the guy jacking your purse look most like?)  But aside from the celebrity fixation, which is a sort of lame reason for liking a song, really, I just like the words.  "I'll be along, dancing, you know it baby.  Tell me your troubles and doubts".... etc.  etc.      urlLink The Ballad of Dorothy Parker:   Prince  I think I love this song for two reasons.  One, it's a Prince song very few people know about and it's got a cool drum line.  Two, it's about  urlLink Dorothy Parker,  who I think is one of the wittiest, funniest, most amazingly strong yet full of pain person I've ever read about.  I did an interpretation of her short story "The Waltz" in high school dramatic interpretation.  It (my performance) wasn't very good.  But I still love the woman who wrote "one more drink and I'll be under the host" and this lovely poem:   Razors pain you;  Rivers are damp;  Acids stain you;  And drugs cause cramp.  Guns aren't lawful;  Nooses give;  Gas smells awful;  You might as well live.    I have no idea if the song really refers to the real life Dorothy or someone else.  But the Dorothy in Prince's song is very witty.  So I choose to think there is a connection.  And I love the line "whoever's calling, can't be as cute as you".      urlLink Killer Queen :   urlLink Que en  I adore Queen.  I really love it in Neil Gaiman & Terry Pratchett's book  urlLink Good Omens  when he says something like "all CD's, if left alone long enough, eventually turn into the Greatest Hits of Queen" and then hears things like Queen's Symphony Number Five & Mozart's "Another One Bites the Dust"... a hybrid of Beethoven & Freddie Mercury.  This song has all the elements I adore-- the line about champagne, the drag queen inspired hand gestures I feel compelled to give while listening to it.  How did anyone ever doubt Freddie Mercury's sexuality, back in the day?  I don't get it.  (My quoting of Gaiman is probably totally off.  Read his book and you'll get it right).    urlLink Wonderful Tonight:   Eric Clapton  This has got to be the all-time best romantic song in the world.  And it is my hubby's & my "song".  Mostly because he's always drinking more than me and needing to be taken home and put to bed.  And he thinks I'm gorgeous at eight in the morning with sleep goo in the corners of my eyes and bad breath.  He's a crazy, misguided man, but I love him.      urlLink In Your Eyes :  Peter Gabriel  Duh! Cause in  urlLink Say Anything , John Cusack holds up that boom box outside her window!  I don't think it needs any more explanation than that, do you?    urlLink Hot For Teacher : Van Halen  When I was young, I used to tell men I was picking up that I wanted to be the teacher that students thought was hot.  That they had fantasies about.  When it actually seemed to happen (when a cute student, last semester I taught, gave me cow eyes all the time) it was actually sort of creepy & scary.  But it was a good line back in the day.      urlLink Add it Up  &  urlLink Kiss Off :  Violent Femmes  Lara Lowry & I, in high school, spent a lot of time in her cool car (a black Nissan 286 or something like that, which she wrecked during her senior and my junior year, with me in it, leaving me with lasting back pain).... memorizing these songs.  And to this day, when either comes on played by a cover band at a bar I'm in, I cannot help but dance with that head banging motion that makes an old woman like me need a visit to the chiropractor the next day.  And if you don't like it, you know what you can do.  (Just kiss off into the air).  Once, some teens who had invaded the bar/restaurant that we frequented and sang one of these (I think it was Kiss Off) really well, back when the neo-punk thing first started raising its ugly head, and they did a good job.  Afterwards I told them they did well-- and the lead one said "Yeah, my mom really likes this kind of music."  Little brat.  I should have punched him. Now THAT'S punk.      urlLink Superfreak :  Rick James  When I was a pre-teen, me and my friend who lived near the trailer park where I lived (I forget her name-- Michelle?  Heather? Ashley?  I can see her face, but her name escapes me) used to go up to the store to get snacks (for me, Dr. Pepper and those red Dolly Madison cake things) while carrying her big giant boom box (usually perched on her shoulder) listening to this song.  We also liked 1984 by Van Halen, but Superfreak sticks better.  I'm fairly certain the ideas in the song warped me forever, because I'd much rather be a Superfreak than a nice girl.    And after looking up the link, I'm really embarrassed that I've been singing a lyric all wrong for many years.  But I'm not telling you which one it is, nor what I sang wrong.    I mean.  Back in my day we didn't have the internet to look up song lyrics with.  We had to play the song over and over and over again.  And those singers really need to learn to enunciate.    There are a lot more songs that could go on this list.  But I think I'll make this a continuing thing and this'll just be a start.    *idea via  urlLink Feministe , and  urlLink The Green Fairy

      The phone rings.  I answer "hello?" woman, sounding tentative:  "um, how much is it for an infant?" "I think you have the wrong number."  "this isn't treehouse learning center?" (thinking, if it were, wouldn't I have said that instead of hello?)  nope.   But what I really wanted to say was:   The phone rings.  I answer "hello?" woman, sounding tentative:  "um, how much is it for an infant?" "how much are you willing to pay?    Really.  The answers are unlimited to that one.  I keep thinking of more, and it just keeps gettin' funnier.

      I have to get myself back into the better shape I was in around December-ish.  I've been travelling so much lately that my gym attendance has fallen off a bit.  Then, when I go to visit various former bridesmaids of mine, they are all tiny and I'm a big old horse.  So today, aerobics with Claudia.  Pretty good, although Monday for some reason (even if I work out, as I did, on Sunday) is the stiff, awkward, can't get this party started day.  Bleah.  And tomorrow is Andrew's birthday.  It's a big one.  We're having a big party this coming weekend, but I've got to think of something to give him tomorrow so that he doesn't get forgotten.  (Besides that.  You all and your naughtiness.)    Otherwise, that's all I got.  Oh. Except for  urlLink the Shining , acted by bunnies and in 30 seconds.  I'm not sure it's as good as the Exorcist.  But it is BUNNIES!!!!!

      Today I checked my phone mail and had this obnoxious "song" sang "to Kim" by some guy with a guitar.  It was about "fetish-y" insulting, disgusting sorts of behavior.  I listened and thought, "who the heck would have sent this to me?"  Then I noticed an unfamiliar number on my caller ID.   So I called it, and there was the voice of the person who had sang the song.  I didn't leave a message, but thought "hmmm."    Then, later in the day, the same  not so smart guy  called my house again, demanding "did someone from this number call my number?!"    I said, "well, actually, you called me first and sang a stupid song...."   but that's as far as I got before he hung up.  I can't figure it out completely.  I suspect it was a "drunk prank" sort of thing where he just dialed random numbers and if he got a girl's voice on a voice mail, sang his stupid song with her name.  This would explain why he didn't recognize my number on the call back.    It's possible (but unlikely) that some disgruntled student who I gave a grade they thought they didn't deserve put a friend up to it.  I do give students my home number.  This person was not a name I recognized, nor a voice, but he did sound about college-age.  And if someone got a bad grade in my class, it would explain the  lack  of logical ability to think through the whole "let's prank call this chick with a call from our own phone number, and totally blow off the idea of caller ID."  (Cause, it's actually pretty easy to get a good grade in my class if you aren't a total idiot).    But this was definitely not too bright.    Dude. If I can get your number on my caller ID, guess what else I can get?  It'll be really hard for you to commit said disgusting act from the song if my large husband comes over to your house and puts his foot in your ass.    But it does make me realize that I guess the age of the prank call is over with caller ID.  I'm not exactly sure that's a loss or a gain.

      It's been raining in San Antonio a lot in the last couple of weeks.  Today, Judy & I went downtown to show her the Alamo and some other things... and it was POURing.  It usually doesn't rain like that in Texas for this long.  It's kind of nice, cause the lawn is nice & green with no effort, but everything gets old after a while.    One of the nice things my sister did for me while I was in Alaska was clean my house-- mop my floors, etc.  She found a book I had lost of old poetry & stuff.  I am really glad she found it-- I had forgotten all about the works in the book.  One of the ones was that poem (haiku-ish) about Supergirl from yesterday.  Then there's this:   Just a small brown moth. Just a warm plant,      and summer ending.     This was written in September '01.  It's a short little nature sketch-- I was kind of in to them right then.   There are others, including some on Sept 11th.  I may post them here eventually.  :)

      Yes, Alaska is huger than Texas.  But I think we in Texas have more attitude.  Funnily enough, on the way home, I heard the song " urlLink Anchorage " by Michelle Shocked.  I'm planning a series of blog entries on the trip, featuring:  Salmon on parade! Brianna, the fabulous tour guide! Sea Lion  Cops ! My "infinity plus one" necklace (with pix, for Kim!) And More!  Here's a little sneak preview:   This is us on our "wildlife cruise."  See that mountain in the back?  It's not even the coolest one we saw.

      this MIGHT be my last post from here, since I don't know if my next place to stay will have a nifty little room for computer access like this Ramada does... but I'll try to find a wireless network somewhere, or you'll just have to pine away without me till I do.  But it's been fun posting here in the hotel lobby computer room.  I got "pinged" last night cause apparently some other guest had left their AOL Instant Messanger thing live-- and someone named Karl who was looking for Bob said HI.  So if you see Bob, tell him Karl said hi.  (I'm sure it wasn't OUR Bob, but any old Bob'll do).

      Well I just did my part.  I found a really nifty little pendant called a "triple infinity" made out of mammoth bone (probably) but it's essentially "infinity plus one".  I liked that, cause that's how much I love my honey bunny.  :)    I also found that I was entirely too embarassed to ask anyone where to find a walrus penis bone.  So I did not end up getting one for anyone.  But I read about it in a guide book and so apparently they do have a bone.  Bulls have them too, so it's not that unusual, by the way.    Anyhoo.  Andrew is officially here-- he's coming to get me soon.  We are subject to the whims of his aircrew, so I'm going to wait till they're all showered and ready to come pick me up.  But I am tired, and have touristed enough for today.  We may go to the glaciers later, but I'm thinking that'll happen tomorrow.    The Alaskans are very friendly-- and it's been a fun morning so far.  I like it here and am having a great time.  Wish you were here.  :)

      So I am out to breakfast, somewhere.  I truly need good coffee too.  I slept well, even though it never did get really dark (the rumors are true.)  :)  I think Andrew is on his way-- I can't get in touch with his cell, which ought to mean he's on a plane flying this way.  He's supposed to be here, if the plans they had last night work out, in about three hours.  Let's hope, cause otherwise, I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do.  Probably head to the airport and get the late flight out.  So.  Here in Alaska, and there are no igloos.  I'm so disappointed.  :)  Oh.  And in a comment, Nissa asked "what is a walrus penis bone?"  It's exactly what it sounds like, dear.

      Cause I am.  I am in Alaska, dear readers. However, the funny part is Andrew is NOT.  His plane broke, and he won't be here till tomorrow.  So.  I am off to explore "downtown" Anchorage to get some food, batteries for my camera because I, like a doofus, left the rechargables recharging AT HOME.  I will also perhaps pick up one of those tacky souvenir walrus penis bones.  Who wants one?!?  I wrote a long blog entry while on the plane ride (the lonnnnnng five hours between Salt Lake & here) but I have to figure out how to transfer it from the laptop to this little computer in the Ramada lobby.  Maybe you'll just have to wait for it.  I also have some cybercafes on the agenda, but we'll see what happens there.    For now, if you see a moose running really fast as though in fear of the Texans invading, then you'll know why.

      I was never really a big traveler in the distant past; we didn't really have the money to go many places.  I never had vacations as a kid (but then, I did live in Florida, so what's the point?)   Recently, with Andrew in the Reserves & me with a special deal on airline tickets, we've been going more places.  This week (Thursday) I'm going to Anchorage Alaska for the weekend.    One of the things I've found on past trips is that you really do need to know something about the place to which you're going.  So I started buying guidebooks (you could probably get them from the library, too, but I like to tear pages out and the librarians really frown on that sort of thing).  Reading the guidebooks gives you that "friend in the area" who knows where the cool places to eat are, and what to avoid.  My favorites are these maps you can get of several cities in the U.S.; they even tell you where the closest, say, Starbucks or Duncan Donuts are, as well as the cool historical & artistic places.  I also like the  urlLink irreverent  guides-- the places recommended were slightly off the beaten track, and it's definitely for younger folks.    But the final things about buying guidebooks, and why I recommend you get them even if you're not planning on going anywhere right away:  1.  you get to dream & plan and imagine a place you've never been before.  After you get to go there, you can look back at the book and remember where you were.   2. the clerks at the bookstore like to see you going somewhere--when I bought my Alaska one last night, the girl behind the counter smiled and asked if I was moving there... when I said "just visiting," she smiled and told me she had lived there.  She had a wistful look on her face and it was a nice human connection.   So in this world where often people can feel really alone, buying guidebooks is a moment of being in this world-- thinking about more than the prescription you have to pick up down the block or the soccer game you're going to later today.

      I put this in comments, then thought maybe I ought to update.  I'm feeling okay-- my toe is stiff and a little sore, but not that bad.  My arms aren't nearly as painful as I was afraid they would be.  In short, I think I will live.    The trip downtown for my sister to see the sights of San Antonio is probably going to be put off a little longer, but that's all right.

      Happy Summer Solstice!!  We went to the lakehouse for Father's Day today.  It was actually really really nice-- the wind was cool and blowing off the lake and it was not too hot.  Andrew bought us a kayak (it's orange) and he and I went kayaking across the lake, quite a distance.  It was fun once he stopped telling me I was doing it all wrong.  :)  My arms were/are quite sore!  If we do this all the time (which is part of the plan) my arms are going to be really buff.  Tonight as we were cleaning up the lake house to leave Nissa accidentally dropped a lid from a Corning wear on my right foot.  Now if you'll recall, last week sometime I  urlLink complained  about my left second toe starting to look like my mom's.  Well.  Now my right foot has gotten sort of squished (it hurts, but I'll live).  And my second toe looks to me a little longer than it was.  Really weird how events are conspiring to make me have my mom's feet.  I'm cursed!  Augh!  (I guess there are worse things I could have).  :)  Right now, after having ice on the toe for the last hour, it is elevated & I'm about to head for bed.  We'll just have to see. I may be very sore tomorrow and need to whine about it more.  Maybe I should change the blog name to Kim Whines.  Nah.  Not nearly as good-sounding.

      I have nothing at all sarcastic or interesting to say about today.  Which in itself is probably both.    We've spent a lovely day, and are watching Love Actually, which has Billy Bob Thornton as the US President & Hugh Grant as English Prime Minister.  Funny. Thornton is playing the pres as a cross between "Clintonian" and Bush "W".  I'm just not sure about it.  We'll see.  It's about halfway done, and sweet, mostly.  Hugh Grant is giving Billy Bob a "look" right now cause Billy has done something awful.    Back to my martini.

      So tonight we're going to hang out with friends at our local place, Chili Pepe's, drink margaritas and veg.  A good time should be had by all.  I am kind of headache-y right now, so I'm planning a nap before the festivities begin.  Perhaps I will read one of my scholarly articles in order to bring on said nap. :)  That way, I can say I  have  worked on the dissertation today, too!  Last night we went to a Missions baseball game.  It was fun-- I made up a margarita for myself, sort of-- they only had beer & nasty wine and since I don't like beer, it looked grim for any refreshing beverage choices.  But they DID have a "do it yourself" flavoring sno cone stand.  They put the ice all cone-y for you and you added flavor.  They had a bottled "faux" margarita-- you know, like the wine coolers (Seagrams & stuff).  So I got "sno cone" ice, and the poured my margarita in it.  Very nice.  Especially with a splash of strawberry sno-cone flavoring.    The game was about half over by the time we got there (and we actually weren't even that late) but we had excellent seats just behind home plate and down by the action.  Missions eventually won-- yay home team!  There was this one guy who was yelling very loudly at both teams.  We really thought he should have volunteered himself as coach cause he knew sooooo much about what the players ought to do.  I was pretty sure from the expression on her face that the woman who was unfortunately seated next to said loud guy with too many 1.00 beers under his belt felt that he ought to offer his services to someone else-- far, far away.    There was also an event where a pop up fly came zipping over and, for a few minutes, looked suspiciously like it was going to conk either me or my sister right on the head.   We stared at it (surely like a couple of....girls) and it bounced just behind us and went flying away.  I felt like that scene in Daria where she stares at the volleyball with all the interest of a cat looking at a broom & mop (as in: none, or pretending that the cat doesn't even actually see the cleaning appliances) and then halfheartedly reaches for the ball.  Try to catch the foul ball?  Are you kidding me?  Nope.  I am not really that sort of athlete.  If you want me to lead the team in a stretch  beforehand, maybe get them doing some aerobics or ab work-- fine.  I can handle that.  But don't count on me to catch those baseballs for you.    Besides, isn't that what those fellas with the cute butts and little baseball hats that chew all that gum and/or tobacco are paid to do?  I mean, they can't be just paid to sit in the hole in the ground and run around a big diamond sketched in the dirt all night, can they?  Okay then.  Off to the napping.

      This weekend is a family holiday-- duh.  Father's Day was never really a big deal to me since my dad left when I was five-ish.  Andrew's family tends to do things on holidays like this, though.  We're going to the house the family owns out at the lake (Canyon).  It can be lots of fun there; it's a very nice lake house and it's right on the lake, so there's swimming & stuff.  We may get a kayak.    But it's also a source of stress-- some family members feel that they do everything, and then feelings get hurt and people get mad.  I wish it could be as easy as it really ought to be... just people hanging out together.    Also, my sister is coming to town, too.  She'll be here in a couple of hours.  She's fun, though, since she radically decided to change her life recently...  it'll be fun to see her.  We're also going to a Missions game tonight.    Anyway.  No real conclusions to offer right now.  But the kayaking will be fun......

      Last night, my friend Aaron had us all over to his company's offices where they have a big screen TV and stuff to watch the NBA finals.  They had a marg machine, and I had several margs.  Partly because I have a really sore neck ever since yesterday morning, and I was anesthetizing myself.  (Excuses!)  Anyway.    Near the end of the night, I don't exactly know what set us off, but Aaron & I ended up "wrassling".  I sort of fight dirty, and I truly hope I didn't hurt him, since (nice) boys can't actually fight dirty back.  Not fair of me, I know, but I was several margaritas past caring.  :)  Anyway.  Andrew got in on it too, and I apparently popped him on the tooth.  I'm just a little hellcat.  Bad Old Me.    That'll learn 'em to sneak up on a drunken "tigger" like that.

      This post is being typed on my new little laptop.  She's very light, cute, and happy to be here.  I had to dump the old wireless router that we had previously in the house-- it never really worked, and was NOT working this AM.  But a quick trip to Best Buy & I have wireless IN THE HOUSE.  Now I'm getting used to the new laptop.  The only thing that is currently a "minus" is that the keyboard rubs funny on my fingernails.  I don't know if I can get used to that-- I may have to (gasp) clip my nails.  It's a little "chalkboard-nail-scrapey".    But see how special I am?  I have a red lava laptop named Pele. She's currently getting all her links set up and I'm going to install new stuff that is completely necessary.  Ugh.  yes.  the fingernail thing is quite irritating.  phooey.  The other laptop has a slightly different feel to the keyboard, making it not so annoying to type on.  We'll see what happens here.

      This "Star Face"  urlLink Analogia  comparison software meme that's going around the internet is quite interesting.  You load a photo of yourself, and click on the eyes, and the software analyzes your face and tells you what celebrities you look like.  It's supposed to work best when the face is straight ahead.  In trying to do this for myself, I realized a couple of things.    The first is that I rarely take pictures with my face straight ahead.  Most of the time, I'm sideways.  I quirk my head a bit to the left almost every time.  I did not realize I do this.  I don't actually know why-- it's not a conscious attempt to, say, get my good side (I don't think I have a good or bad side).  So it was really hard to find a good photo to use for this project.  The one I did use, there on the far left of my screen, is a rather old but cute photo.  I like my hair like that.    The second thing I realized is the sinister part. If you go to  urlLink the main page  and not the celebrity face page, you find that this software is being developed as part of "person identification in criminal investigations performing the recognition of the unknown human portrait in large database"  (to quote the website, which has slightly off English grammar, so I suspect is being developed in another country).  So what I think is that all the people submitting their photos and laughing over who they look like are actually helping them test the software.  How else could they get millions of totally random people to post their photos to their database?  It's clear that they have lots of celebrity photos, gotten off of the internet.  So my sinister suspicious Scully self said "this is really funny.  Now my photo is in their database. I'd better not commit any crimes."    But I'm not too worried, because, based on my little experiments,  the software still has a long way to go .  The first photo got me matched up with the following fun results:   Another photo got these:   So clearly, hairstyle, lipstick/smile, and other effects do change the results slightly.  My vanity wants to believe I somehow resemble Audrey Hepburn, but I know I do not.  Most of my life, if I get a "hey, you look like" it's been:   urlLink Molly Ringwald  (cause of my hair)  urlLink Ally Sheedy  (which I think is much closer)  urlLink Frances McDormand  (you know, the chick from Fargo).  My sister used to get Jamie Lee Curtis all the time, so that one is a maybe.  It seems the software goes on eye distance, and maybe chin shape.   If I post the first picture and say I'm a male, I get the following:    I even saw an example someone else put up where they posted their cat's photo, so I tried this myself.  Tituba, of course, is psyched that she looks like Nikki Taylor and Giselle.  She is a little bummed about the Mariah Carey thing though. She watched Glitter one night when she couldn't sleep and has never been able to listen to Mariah since.  I think I got Giselle on one of the attempts to get a good results list, so maybe it's true that you start to resemble your pets over time.  How the heck do they analyze cat face and get these results?    via  urlLink Feministe

      Usually, I let my front flower beds grow pretty wild & a little weedy.  They're filled with ornamental grasses and Lantana bushes, which means that for the most part, the weedy overgrown look is good--looks nice & natural and "Romantic".  But a Queen Anne's Lace style weed had died out there, and needed to have all the dead straggly bits pulled up before the neighborhood association came after me with one of their little "letters".    So I gardened today. The yard looks pretty good now; and I should be out standing in the front, gloating at my nice, neat yard.     BUT I was stung by an angry wasp, who was not at all thrilled with my remodeling plans for the weed where his nest was located.  And no, I don't mean a "white-guy-named-Biff-from-Cape-Cod-who-went-to-Harvard-and-lettered-in-rowing-WASP."  I mean a red, flying, buzzing, sting-like-fire and instantly making your hand swell up sort of wasp.    I shrieked and ran into the house; Andrew helped me put baking soda/vinegar, and now, toothpaste (all three worked wonders, by the way.  Although the toothpaste is a bit messy & keeps getting licked off).  The bad news here is that now there's a wasp flying around in my front yard with the taste of Kim in his little mouth.  And I think he kind of likes it.    I just wish he'd take that little boating hat off, and put down the martini.  He looks like a sort of  urlLink James Spader  bad boy.  He keeps inviting me over for "cocktails" but I'm sure he'd only hurt me again.

      Yesterday, I REAAAAALLLLLLY cleaned my office.  This was something done to make my wonnerful hubby happy.  (Surprisingly, I really like the clean office too.  But that's beside the point).    In the midst of the cleaning, I found a paper written while in grad school, which I gave a presentation on during said class.  The paper had some issues the teacher didn't like, which I remembered.  What I didn't remember is a comment scrawled on the last page of my essay about my performance during the oral presentation.  He said that "sometimes my voice sounded sharp and loud.  Maybe from nervousness."  No.  Really.  Actually, sometimes just for fun I really like to make myself as unpleasant as possible.  It had nothing to do with nerves; I'd really rather just weaken my claims/arguments by irritating my audience.    I mean.  What kind of comment is that to make on someone's paper?  I have written comments on oral presentations many many times, and yes, I will comment on someone's voice if they cannot be heard (saying something from the Thumper school of saying it nicely or not saying it at all) like-- sometimes your voice was hard to hear-- try speaking up. But the sharp and loud, that really kind of hurts my feelings because I have no freakin' idea what he meant, and while maybe I was nervous, maybe he was just hating my normal presentation voice.  You would think someone with a PhD and years of experience would be able to figure out a better way of telling me what was happening.  But then again.  Perhaps I should go for sharp and loud as my normal style. A la The Nanny. Whaddaya Think?! (read last two words sharply.  and loudly).

      Helping the hubby research stuff for his stock venture* I was in a neck of the woods that I don't normally visit-- CNN Money.  It was scary there-- news about  urlLink Bull and Bear  markets, investment profiles with  urlLink charts  that went up and down with math-like lines and numbers and stuff.  For this English major, and girl who can easily figure out at least three languages, there just seemed to be a lot of language that was hard for me to get.  Doublespeak and stuff.    But then I spotted her, that familiar glint in her wide blue eyes, the pink accessories, the oh so blond hair.  Barbie.   urlLink Barbie is launching a new clothing line   for real women . For this girl who remembers well when Barbie mentioned math being hard, in my math-induced phobic reaction to the Money pages, she held out a well-manicured hand and said " urlLink succor "!     Remember dressing Barbie in those cute vintage-like Jackie-O clothes?  Well, apparently, soon, you can pop into the Barbie store, right next door to, say Banana Republic, and pick up some kicky shoes and a matching belt.  And lots of pink.  The story says that Mattell (parent company to Barbie) opened several stores in Japan and they did very well.    I can see that.  Many Japanese just love what is perceived as "American" culture.  Andrew tells me in other places, there are "Lipton" stores that are like Starbucks here-- people think Lipton is soooo American, it's kind of cool to pop into these stores.  I'm not sure Americans would think so-- I mean, Lipton?  Bad, always tastes a bit instant to me tea? Too-salty soup?    So success in Japan doesn't mean that the Hilton sisters next-big-thing is to sport Barbie clothes on the red carpet.    But I wonder.  I can see Barbie clothing doing well in a certain niche market.  Maybe just BECAUSE of the camp value.  Going clubbing?  Want to pick up Ken?  Perhaps you like GI Joe?  Maybe the ultimate Barbie outfit is just the thing.  But then, alas, you find that Ken & GI Joe in the real world are just as "anatomically correct" as our Barbie found when she finally kicked off those pink stillettos and pulled Ken/GI Joe into her "not so bendy" arms.  Disappointing?  Yes.   I'm pretty sure that is how the Barbie Mattel folks are going to feel eventually.       *He says he is "looking to diversify our investments to outperform the Dow Jones for money to put our future kids through college and for our eventual retirement."  Yes.  That is a noble quest, and worthy.  However, I suspect he really just wants to make enough on stocks to wander about the house dressed like  urlLink Mr. Moneybags  wearing a monocle and saying things like "OOh Muffy.  Let's go to the coast" in an affected accent. Since his best accent is a Texan whose been drinking too much beer, I'm pretty sure that he can't do East Coast boat-club very well.  I'm pretty sure he'll sound a lot more like Rodney Dangerfield in  urlLink Back to School .

      Okay. I talked about Gretchen's "Redneck Woman" song once before in this blog.  I have to say, now that her album is out, I like her even more.  I dunno if it's living in Texas, if the water just eventually makes you like country music and women who know the difference between a 15 round clip and a rifle, or whatever, but I like girl country.  I just burned a CD from Rhapsody which included Gretchen's entire new album, plus such cool country diva songs as:   Tanya Tucker's "Texas" Dolly Parton's "Romeo" as well as artists whose name currently (in my martini drinking state) ex-cape me.    And I'm totally and completely thrilled.  I got a hit to my blog search terms looking for info on how "Gretchen Wilson is not southern."  Well.  Apparently, as is no secret (it's posted on her website for christussake) she was born in Illinois.  And lived there till at least 15.  But then lived at least for awhile in Missouri.    I'm here to tell ya.  Now, being born north of the Mason-Dixon may preclude me from ever being a native Southerner. But I know how to use "fixin'" and "all yall" in a sentence correctly.  And I married a Texan.  And I plan to birth me some babies here in the South one day.  AND I lived in a trailer park for entirely more time than I care to recall.  And I can make a mean batch of beef enchiladas with Chili, as well as "Chicken Bog" and "Beignets" and other various southern food.  So Southern doesn't mean born there. And as I discovered when I lived in Washington state, there are bars way up north that you could lift up, pop down to the deepest part of Mississippi and it would not be out of place.  Redneck is a state of mind.  And while I don't always qualify (I do, after all, appreciate Tiffany's and Moet Chandon, as well as Sushi and Brie) I always love where I grew up.  And when I go up north, they always say "You talk funny.  Where are you from.?"    To which I reply:  "That, my friend, is a long story."    And a reason why I have a certain affinity for Ms. Wilson. More power to her, and I hope she makes enough money to swim in diamond jacuzzis (although that would be impractical).  If I weren't going to Alaska when she comes to my hometown I would SO be at the concert.  Two-steppin.  And wearing my ostrich skin boots.  And some tight jeans.  And yellin' yyyeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee haw.    Just so's you know.

      When I was a little girl, my mother dated a man from Alabama who was a mean man.  And I mean "mean" in almost all the ways the word can denote.    Selfish in a petty way; unkind.  Cruel, spiteful, or malicious.  Ignoble; base: a mean motive.  Miserly; stingy.  Low in quality or grade; inferior.  Low in value or amount; paltry: paid no mean amount for the new shoes.  Common or poor in appearance; shabby: "The rowhouses had been darkened by the rain and looked meaner and grimmer than ever" (Anne Tyler).  Low in social status; of humble origins.  Humiliated or ashamed.  In poor physical condition; sick or debilitated.  Extremely unpleasant or disagreeable: The meanest storm in years.  Informal. Ill-tempered.  from  urlLink dictionary.com    What he liked best of all was to keep my mother (and therefore, me) in his control.  He would get petulantly angry and throw a mean assed fit which often included things being thrown down the stairs (a Thanksgiving turkey once, my sister's wedding cake another time).  Things that especially made him mad were when my mother had control over herSELF-- if she got a job, for instance, he would start tons of fights until she quit from the sheer weariness over the battle.  In fact, he is part of the reason I am a staunch feminist in life-- I know how vitally important it is for women to have control of their own destinies, because nasty little men like him exist in droves, and if women cannot choose their own way in life, their own education, their own jobs, their reproductive freedoms, they will be stuck with mean men like him.    But wait, what does this have to do with red?  I'm glad you asked.  B. (I'll call him that just to be nice, which I am) used to say that women who wore "whore red" nail polish were, well, whores.  And that, my friend, was the worst thing you could be in B's book.  A woman who had the audacity to like red fingernails clearly must have been sexually promiscuous and nasty.  No matter what other traits she might have.  Heck, she might be saving orphans from a fire but if she had red fingernails while doing it, she was a whore and deserved to be smacked around.    Well.  I love red.  I have whore red fingernails RIGHT NOW and I adore the way my nails look, with slightly squared tips and this deep  urlLink OPI "I'm Not Really a Waitress - NLH08 red" richness that screams "I AM IN CONTROL OF MY OWN DESTINY.  MY OWN BODY.  AND YOU, MEAN LITTLE MAN, ARE POINTLESS."

      Maybe I shouldn't say evil.  Happy?  Bubbly?  Thrilled?  Cause last night, I ordered my new laptop!  It'll be "ready to ship" on June 16.  I should get it three or four days later.  WOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Now I'm trying to decide what to name her.  I'm leaning towards  urlLink Pele  cause she's got that lava red cover.  What other volcanic types are there?   urlLink Kali , maybe.  Keeping it "in" my culture, there's  urlLink Brigid -- but I named another laptop a similar name, (before Uncle Bob went and changed it to Angelina, after the actress-- which so steamed me.....)so that probably won't work.  I think  urlLink Durga  might qualify as "volcanic" of sorts, depending on how you define it (fiery temper-- boy, that opens it to lots of goddesses).  Incidentally, the links to the really cool goddess pix is my "cousin-in-law."  She's a really sweet lady who is a great artist, and I got a deck of those  urlLink Goddess Oracle  cards for Christmas one year.  Anyway.  I'm excited.  I can't wait to get my new toy, but it requires me to set the self-goal of writing EVERY SINGLE DAY on the dissertation.  Otherwise, Andrew will get awfully cranky.

      There's this fun page where you can go to make your own version of yourself as you would appear on South Park.   urlLink Go get your own !  Here are Andrew & Me.  It's funny how it really works.  That we don't have such obvious freckles as grown ups is irrelevant cause as little kids we both totally did.  And Andrew would totally wear that T-shirt.  (In fact, I ought to get him one).  You can see much bigger versions of these pix on the " urlLink pix " page.       Stolen from  urlLink Sue

      I have convinced the hubby that I need a new laptop.  Huzzah!  This weekend, I actually FOUND an internet cafe in Shreveport (it's new! and fun!  I like it alot).  But my OLD decrepit laptop would not work there-- the wireless access card just couldn't be configured, and the tech support I TRIED to call pissed me off so that I returned the product bright and early the next day.    Here's a tip to tech support companies:  if a person is using a product that is the way they get online, and you do not have a backup plan other than "you can't get tech support till you register your product" and so that if the product is NOT FREAKIN' working (the reason one would be calling tech support in the first place) and said customer can't get online to "register online," then what you're saying is that you don't want MY business at least.  (Rant finished.  Thank you.  I'll be here all week!)    Anyway.  I'm looking at a sweeeeeeeeet little Dell laptop that weighs in at about 5 pounds, has integrated wireless internet, a FREE DVD player/CD Burner upgrade, bunches of memory & hard drive & stuff.  It also, and this is the coolest part, has the ability to put pretty color plastic thingys on it so that your laptop is CUSTOMIZED(as seen there to the left).  Mine will be lava red, cause red is my FAVORITE color.  I do think all those technical details are important-- RAM, and graphics card, and what OS the computer have. Yadda Yadda.  But it's RED!!! That's much more important.  Like Fernando on SNL (played by Billy Crystal) once said, "It is better to look good than feel good.  And my darling.  You. Look.  Marvelous."    Finally, I am currently working on my   urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer   chapter of the dissertation.  It's slow going, in some ways, cause I decided over the weekend that I really needed to expand the discussion to all the major, recurring female characters (at least a little bit) because they all display a form of popular feminism.  This includes the vampires, and Glory, the evil god of season five.  Re-watching the episodes makes me miss the show a whole, whole bunch.  There's just nothing that can possibly compare to the witty, smartness of Buffy.  If you weren't a fan while it was on, you should  urlLink catch it on FX  sometime.  I had thought at one time that it was a silly "teen" show-- which it definitely was not.  (Silly, nor just "teen" oriented).  Sigh.  But at least I have the DVDs.  I need to go get the sixth season which just came out.  I Heart Buffy!!        But I am working, and working hard.  So, in the truest spirit of procrastinating, "official" procrastination is being put off for now.  :)  It's a novel concept-- once you turn procrastination into work, you can only escape it and procrastinate by actually working.  (Yes.  The logic is astounding.  Think about it for a sec.)

      To begin, some background.    I have Fred Flintstone fat stubby feet.  At 5.7 feet 1/2 high, I have feet that are approximately 7s, or 6.5s depending on the brand.  But they are WIDE and square.  My mom (Sorry mom. you'll just have to live with your internet infamy) has long, monkey feet.  Long, narrow toes, with a slender, not at all fat-like-mine appearance.  So imagine my surprise this evening when I looked down and noticed that, on my left foot, my second toe suddenly looks like my mom's foot.  She can grip things (like, say, a roll of quarters) with her toes.    Yes.  My  mother's feet are long.  And narrow.  And slightly--  Well.  Simian.    WTF?!!      Do our feet grow after 30?  How the hell can my feet suddenly look like my mother's feet?  Where the Hell did this long narrow toe come from?    Is there someone I can discuss this issue with, perhaps someone in management, who can give me a refund, or a gift card with store credit or something?  I feel so.....       defeeted.

      In Shreveport, one of the things I noticed was an abundance of Magnolia trees, in bloom with the gorgeous, waxy white flower and deep green leaves.  We don't have many Magnolias in Texas-- I'm sure because it doesn't rain enough to keep them happy.  But I love these trees-- they are so big, and their canopy spreads so greenly with the punctuating white flowers that smell sweet as you lie beneath the tree.  Willow trees are probably my second favorite-- and we don't have them in Texas either.  Their drooping softly green branches sway in any breeze, and they are just so pretty.    Several large trees had been uprooted by what was apparently a pretty good wind storm a few days before we got to Shreveport-- their roots upended, the large, once formidable tree lying pathetically on its side.  You wonder if the trees surrounding them are in mourning for the loss.    But, aside from the sadness of tree untimely death, there was a happy silver lining, at least for squirrels.  There were so many scampering about that I joked it must be some sort of squirrel revolucion-- "Vive La Fuzzy Tailed!!"  Andrew guessed that the storm that uprooted the trees & knocked down thick branches must have also shaken loose lots of acorns. AAHH!  So the little black and grey squirrels had their work cut out for them in harvesting the unexpected bounty of acorns strewn about haphazardly.    But I still like the idea of the squirrel uprising.  "Your anti-squirrel tyranny is at an end, humans!  Today, we rise up and overpower your..... ooooooh!  look!! acorns!!!!"

      I love it when studies show I'm right cause then I can argue with my "constantly reads the news media" husband who says "prove it"....     urlLink This article  reports on a study that shows that women still make less money than men in the same job in MOST fields.  That there are very few positions where a man & woman with the same qualifications make the same amount or the woman makes more.    To do the responsible blogger thing and quote: Nationally, the median income for a woman working full-time, year-round was about $28,000, compared with $38,000 for a man. That means a woman earned less than 74 cents for every dollar earned by a man.   STILL!!  And my wonderful hubby has been debating this with me forever, so now I get to argue with him!  Yay!   And, in the meantime, another interesting article caught my eye while I was browsing for the stats on the "jobs & women" blurb I had heard on CNN this AM.  (I never actually found it-- it said something about only five jobs where women make the same amounts-- but even on their website, I didn't find that particular info.  Feel free to post if you see it.     OOps-- sorry about the tangent .  The "eye catcher" mentioned before my aside was  urlLink this article , tongue in cheek though it may be, on marriage and women today.  One of the quotes that sprung out at me: I'd rather turn tricks than marry for money. At least you get variety. And no pretense of happiness. I think pretense is the most exhausting thing in the world. Don't wear me out by making me pretend to be happy.    Somehow, this reminds me very much of an argument that I (from the wrong side of the tracks and with a mom who was a working-poor single-mom) got into once with a very wealthy college roommate on whether it's more degrading to clean toilets for a living or to be a stripper/hooker/etc. I argue that if you're a good stripper/hooker who's makin' the big bucks that some of those high priced ladies can get, you may actually be happier and less degraded than a maid that makes no freakin' money at all to do things that aren't exactly my favorite activities.  Money can certainly smooth a lot of frustrations on the job.  And as the article above points out, at least it's honest about the exchange.  And I remember that roommate being really sweet, but really condescending like I just didn't understand that hookers are all miserably unhappy cause who would like sex anyway?   (which was generally the feeling I got from our discussion, and I got sorta mad).    So is it better, then, darlings, to be the "Pretty Woman" and turn tricks than to marry for money?  Oh, but didn't America's Sweetheart with the horsey smile do both in that movie?   Tell me.  Hooker?  Trophy Wife?  Neither?  Both? Or would you rather be desperately poor but strong in your moral convictions?  For me, I'll take..... (cliffhanger, to be answered only if you are all good and make many many comments on this blog entry over the weekend.)   Okay. Two fairly unrelated posts, and I'm dangerously close to breaking my own rule on no more than one political post a week (which is unwritten, till now).  But still.  It'll give you something to think on while I'm in Louisiana.  (AKA, for me at least, the Internet-less hinterlands).

      I had to go downtown this morning to protest the above-market-value tax assessment of our little house.  The good news is that our property value has gone up a bit lately.  That means, of course, we have to pay the Taxman more for it.  The other good news is it hasn't gone up the 20,000 dollars they SAID it had (which would have been a MUCH bigger chunk of money to pay).  It's sort of a game-- they assume most people don't have the advance knowledge to protest something that big of a hike, and they make some money off of those who don't bother to protest.  So it was adjusted a bit down from what they thought we ought to pay (about 10,000 dollars worth, which adds up to a lot less we have to pay for it).    But it meant I had to drive in downtown San Antonio-- which, like all downtowns of a city older than 50 years, was a pain in the butt.  One way streets here, streets that Mapquest doesn't know end there.  I left so that I would have gotten there more than an hour early and it took me so long to navigate the streets that I actually was only 30 minutes early in the long run.  But they were surprisingly efficient at the assessment offices, and quick, too.    So in reward, I went and got myself a french manicure.  :)  Girl's gotta have her little rewards here and there.   Later today, we're driving to Shreveport for Andrew's Reserve duty weekend.  So that means no posts from me till probably Tuesday.  If I could find an Internet cafe in Shreveport, well....  I don't think that's going to happen, but there's always a chance, I guess.  (I haven't seen one yet, though).    And I'm very sleepy cause I had several hours of insomnia last night (this morning.)  It caught, too, and Andrew ended up being awake for a couple of hours too.  The cat protested loudly-- we messed up her sleeping schedule.  I thought cats were supposed to be nocturnal!  So I need a nap or else there will be one drowsy driver later today.  At least, with all the work I got done on the dissertation yesterday, I don't have to feel ragingly guilty about resting & not working today (at least).    So that's the news.  The weather?  Surprisingly, only 79 degrees right this sec, and scattered clouds.  Picture me, then, in a nice weather girl sweater and a cute, perky smile, pointing at the national map.  That's pretty much accurate (except, of course, for the sleepy bags under my eyes.)

      I just sent my introductory chapter of my dissertation to my committee chair FOR THE FIRST TIME SHE'S SEEN IT!!!!!!  It's 72 pages long.  It's blood, sweat, tears, and a few curse words here and there.  I am terrified she will hate it.  And thrilled that I finally have SOMETHING to show her.  My heart is actually racing right now, minutes after I've sent it to her in an email.    I know she won't get it tonight probably, since the school day is over, and I'm quite sure she won't get around to reading and commenting on it for a while.  I am, after all, not her only game in town.   I may explode waiting for her to write back, however.    Deep, cleansing breaths.

      Once, a while back, I took the spark.com's  urlLink gender test  and it told me I was a man.  Well.  That was a surprise to my breasts, and they really took it hard.  (Ew.  That sounds sort of dirty.)  So today, after noticing this "Name Anacronym" quiz thing on  urlLink Vadge Zaavice , I tried it out.  And damned if it didn't happen again:      K     Kind       I     Intelligent       M     Masculine       Name / Username:       urlLink Name Acronym Generator  From  urlLink Go-Quiz.com   If I try Kimberly, it's not so bad.  But I go by Kim.  So.       K     Kind       I     Innocent       M     Mischievous       B     Boisterous       E     Entertaining       R     Rounded       L     Lazy       Y     Young       Name / Username:       urlLink Name Acronym Generator  From  urlLink Go-Quiz.com   Now stop bugging me.  I need to go write on my intro chapter for a while so I can stop feeling so damned lazy & guilty.  (notice how Kimberly includes Lazy).  Hmmmmm.

      Yesterday, as part of my ongoing project of publishing the new issue of  urlLink Women Writers  (did I mention you should go look over there?)  I was talking with  urlLink Feministe's  "owner" about feminism.  Part of the questions I asked her was how often she gets backlash from her very vocal feminism on her site.  She said, "you want examples?  Go look at the  urlLink comments on this guy's blog " (I'm paraphrasing-- she was a little more upset than that).  The guy who owns the blog is perfectly logical in his defense of his position-- and that's the point of debate, dear reader.  If everyone shared the same opinions, then the world would be a boring old place.    But, as I went to look at the comments, I found what scares me over and over about creepy anti-feminists.  It all stemmed from an article written about an article about where the women who were interested in politics were, as far as bloggers go.  It was absolutely bone-chilling the way one particular commenter (by the name of Stephen) was nasty, insulting, and just plain rude.  And I was sort of sad that while other commenters tried to put Stephen in his place, (to which he just lobbed more irrational, histrionic & petty comments back) the owner of the blog never stopped good Old Stephen.  It was all personal attack, no logic, no reasons, no facts.  In claiming that feminism equals Naziism, he didn't give a particular example of anything feminism has done which is similar to the Nazis. But it's a favorite trick for people to pull out because it's a hard one to defend oneself against even if you care to try.  Yes, there are some very radical feminists who have some, shall we say, extreme views on their own superiority.  But feminism is NOT about women proving they are superior, and many in the feminist movement have, in the past, present, and future, fought over a certain hijacking of the word/term "feminist" for views which are not so much about equality and fairness and a perspective of the world based on gender awareness but which are just petty, mean excuses to lord oneself over others.    So anyway.  The point.  There is a reason, which I've discussed before, why this blog is not usually political.  I do most of my politics over there at women writers; and it's mostly polite, nicey nicey feminism with an occasional fracas about, say abortion rights.  (Wherein I have to delete spammers from my bulletin board who have completely missed the point that it is MY space, and I don't have to actually listen to their opinions there).  But this blog is mostly my daily thoughts.  Yes, I am more of a journaler, and I am frankly uninterested in most political blogs.  (Feministe is an exception because I appreciate Lauren's take on issues).  Many political blogs are exactly what good Old Stephen, with his nasty remarks and superiority complex (perhaps making up for some deficiency in his, shall we say, phallogocentrism?) represents.  And they're often just collections of "hey, look at this article" and "let's make a brief comment on this link."  It bores me.  Andrew, on the other hand, would, if he were a blogger, probably do a political blog.  But he would not tolerate rudeness, cause I'd smack him over the head for it. :)    Finally.  Again, my point (took me long enough, right?)  I am a feminist.  A raging one.  I don't believe I am superior to anyone else because of my gender, however.  I do believe I am superior to assholes like Stephen because of my intellect, and my great hooters.  :)  And if someone like him wants to tangle with me, and/or "take back the world from my Nazi tactics" they better realize this.  I am the woman who once wrote a paper titled "Feminists for the NRA."  And I keep it loaded and am a damn good shot.  Come and force me into a burka muthafucka.  Just try it.

       urlLink This  is my favorite picture of Marilyn Monroe, who we usually think of as soft, and who would have thought she'd be working out with weights back in 1952?    Just sharing.

      Okay.  I made myself a latte with our shiny espresso machine.  (I should post a photo.   urlLink There ).*  It's a little splotchy with some milk that had foamed out on it.  But that just shows how much we lurve it.    Then I sat here at the computer for about an hour, reading other people's blogs.  I went down my entire list of blogs on my blogroll, even Aaron's, although he NEVER posts.  (Which is good, cause then it's a quick peek and a move on to the next blog).  A few I had to catch up on-- I hadn't read in a while.  Others make me envious and wish they had links to my blog on them, cause then I would be cooler.  I may procrastinate, but I can get a job done when it's really really important (like seeing what other people did yesterday.  THAT is important).  I answered a few emails, read my morning  urlLink Get Fuzzy .  (Yes-- one can make fun of the Amish and get away with it.)   Today I must type up the five book reviews I wrote last night for my women writers site.  Then I really really really need to write on my dissertation.  I've almost forgotten what that first chapter is about, and where I stood on the editing process.  I realize that part of dissertation writing is sort of like death-- the five stages-- grief, denial, acceptance, bargaining.  What is the other one?  I'm too lazy to look it up.  I think I'm currently in "bargaining."  If I write five words a week till I die, then maybe, just maybe, I'll have it done by then.  (Provided I have the nice long life I'm hoping for.)    In the meantime, I'm going to eat some of the wonderful leftover lasagna I made this weekend as a bribe for the guy who is going to build our bar (and his wife.  nice people).  And have another cofee.  And complain that it's hot in here.  So for the rest of the day, that is my official plan.  Oh, and eventually I'll exercise.  (Don't I complain enough about that?  No.  I don't actually want any replies to that).        *Yes, I photographed my espresso machine for no really good reason.  It was because I know I'm always talking about it and wanted to share with my "thirties" of blog readers.  I'm always here for you guys.

      When I was a little kid, and I would say "I hate Susie, she's mean" my mom would always say "you don't hate anyone...you strongly dislike her".  For some reason, the word "hate" was something my mom didn't want me to use.  I don't really know what the main difference between "strongly dislike" and "hate" is other than PC-ness (really, you were ahead of your time, ma) but still.    So on that end, I have to say I'm rebelling.  I totally HATE people who intentionally spam, who intentionally create email programs that create SPAM, who create viruses who also create spam.    You may be asking yourself:  "Self, why is it that Kim is so adamant about her hatred for these misguided people?" And I would answer  Because I just spent SEVERAL HOURS of my precious life trying to  1. delete the 1000s of pieces of spam I had in an email account for my  urlLink women writers  website (which has finally gone "live" with the new summer version, by the way) 2. revise said site, which has over 600 pages, with a javascript email contact thingy so that those damn spammers can't find the new non-spam-friendly address, but which real people can use to contact me, which I am about to change to avoid future downloads of 1000s ( literally !!!) of spam about my penis size, or diet pills, or "URGENT" or "IMPORTANT".     Hate is not strong enough of a word, really.  Sorry Mom.

      There's this website called  urlLink Fitday.com  which will tell you how many calories you can burn by, say, walking  up  stairs for ten minutes straight (72 calories burned) or toweling off while standing, for ten minutes (31 calories).  But I haven't been able to find how many calories sitting at your computer WHILE WEARING workout clothes burns.  Surely the fact that I am wearing workout clothes counts for something, right?

      I was a bad girl last night and stayed up till something like 2 in the morning reading my book ( Bitten -- mentioned this weekend).  It was one of those books that start slow but once you get to a certain point, you really just want to finish.  I may, in fact, have some sort of  urlLink book addiction .  But because I didn't get to sleep till so late, I tried desperately to sleep later today; I'm over 21, you know, and need my beauty rest.  However, I only managed about an hour more than my usual time to wake up (despite the not-going-to-bed-at-a reasonable hour differential)-- for two reasons.    Reason number one :  the cat.  She was ready for me to get up at 9:30, and I must have wiggled in my attempt to sleep longer and it encouraged her to sit, purring very loudly, next to my head.  See, she figures if she's purring, I can't get mad at her.     Reason number two , and the most irritating one:  the next-door-neighbor-kids are on summer break and picked this morning to start their frickin' basketball bouncing.  I hate to be such a grumpy old "you kids better watch it" neighbor, but I really hate the sound of those damn basketballs bouncing.  If the kids had any chance of some sort of NBA career or  any  sort of talent, it might be different.  But they also like to scream while playing, so it's a truly annoying practice.    So I'm up, and a bit grumpy, and now I am seriously going to finish women writers summer issue today.  Thank God for coffee, or else there might be nuclear detonation over here.

       Okay. I know. It's a sickness. But it IS Saturday, and after I went to my bellydance class (which rocked, by the way!!) I came home and played some more with the Pixel Kims. I found some clothes that look a little bit like basic bellydance outfits.  I also found my  urlLink sexy librarian glasses  and I found a kitty cat that looks a bit like Tituba.  Note that she's opening her mouth to complain that she hasn't been fed yet. That is very, very realistic. The bellydance costumes are more the "Egyptian Cabaret style" of costumes than the one that I listed on the site earlier this week.  The one I made borders on a mixture between Cabaret & Tribal.  Sort of.  But it's mostly just cool.   This last one includes "fun with filters."  Speaking of bellydance, I made the decision to try out the local studio today.  The class was an "Intermediate/Advanced Drillz" class.  I learned a basic choreography, and got a great sweaty workout also.  The choreography that I learned was sort of "Bollywood" ish, and very fun.  I was practicing it in the living room and the guy who is making our new coffee bar (a cool friend of ours who is also a shop teacher) busted me practicing.  I think he'll live.  But I'm sure that out of context it was a little weird. Ah well.  I'm weird.  That's the truth.  I may have to waste some time building Nissa pixel dolls too.  We'll see.  The hubby will be home soon and I have to act like a grown up and cook dinner.  (Spagetti.)

      Okay, if you have seen it here just moments ago and it's now gone, you're wondering why I have just done my first ever self-censoring.  Well, I've taken that post off for at least the time being cause I don't want the person to whom it was referring to find this blog and use the post as fodder for some sort of weird obsession.  I just got another sad email, and I'm now worried that I really really should have ignored the person.    Sheesh.  You try to be nice.

       Hah!  Because she's a fabulous person and web surfer looking at things I hadn't seen,  urlLink Liz  sent me to  urlLink this website  yesterday in a comment.  Oh Glorious glory!  While I still think a pixel-person created by  urlLink Chris D . would be cool, I have a few pixel Kims that I made on the website.  The first is just a plain old Kim, standing around, perhaps waiting for the husband to finish making her a latte. She's wearing her favorite red shirt and her loose fitting (not the skinny) jeans.  Too many lattes have made her have to keep the skinny jeans in the closet for now.     The next Kim has been watching a lot of MTV and just got back from Hot Topic where she felt sort of old around the other shoppers, but still loved the cool t-shirts and funky "punk rock" pants that she's wanted since punk was cool the first time (and a lot more hard core).  At Hot Topic, she did see this t-shirt she totally wanted to get for the future Wells Jr.  (Not that the Wells Jr. will be around to wear it for a long while, as far as she knows, but it's still so damned cute.)   Then we have "going out to P.F. Chang's for dinner" pixel Kim.   Again in red, she has a loose fit so she can eat all of her rice-noodles with ginger & chicken and basil, as well as share on of those "Great Wall" chocolate desserts.      Then we have Pixel Kim's true (wickedly naughty but still sweet) nature.  You realize, of course, that I do own my very own angel wings?  Why, there's a picture of me wearing them right over there in my "profile" link.  These wings are in their real color, when I don't magically turn them white because it freaks people out for me to have fairy wings instead of angel ones.  Cause thinking I'm a naughty fairy worries them.     Then finally, we have what is undoubtedly my favorite pixel Kim, although I have to admit I don't own my own pair of handcuffs in real-life.  I really like the leather cat suit. (Which I have seen AND TRIED ON at Hot Topic in the past.  Granted, it was a Halloween costume, but maybe someday I'll deserve to wear a skin tight pleather cat suit like this one.)    Now this doesn't mean that if you're trying to create a pixel version of me on your own, you talented fabulous people you, that you should stop.  I mean, what I really want is a pixel Kim in a bellydance outfit.  Maybe my red one, that you see pictured in the post below.  (Hint.  Hint).  But these will do for now.    I tried to make a Pixel Hubby but the guys on the website were all hopelessly NOT my husband.  The girl who created this comic has a fairly normal image of what a girl can look like with the proper workouts and sensible eating.  But the boy bodies were all ridiculously buff with World Power Lifter Abs.  I am afraid the poor thing has some real disappointment ahead of her with the reality of husband-ly-ness.  But that's another blog.

        And the thing it's supposed to mean is: Indicates the outcome of the matter.Victory. A triumphant attitude that inspires. Success as a result of hard work. A blessed result. Advancement. High energy. &nbsp; With my question, it's a little weird to get this answer.&nbsp; But I'm not telling what the question was.&nbsp;&nbsp;I know.&nbsp; That's mean of me.&nbsp; But it's interesting, nevertheless.&nbsp;

      The hubby & I tend to wake each other up in the middle of the night if one of us needs to go to the bathroom.&nbsp; Since we both have tiny little bladders and drink a lot of water, it is a rare night when we sleep through the whole thing.&nbsp;   This morning, about 4 am, he got up.&nbsp; It woke me, so I figured "what the heck" and went too. (Two bathrooms.&nbsp; Wonderful invention).&nbsp; Then, back in bed, cool under ceiling fan and soft white sheets, we both lay there for a long time, sleepless.&nbsp; He would flop to one side, I would move my legs.&nbsp; He would sling his long leg over mine and then do this annoying twitchy-spasm thing he sometimes does, so I would move.&nbsp; We were trying hard to fall asleep again, very tired still.&nbsp; But I lay there with those thoughts you get at 4 am, thinking thinking, and knowing that I would never be able to re-capture them properly when awake.&nbsp;    The plot for my "fan fiction" of Evil Vampire Willow in  Buffy the Vampire Slayer .  My dissertation. Feel guilty.  Worrying about the step aerobic routine I need to write for my new class I'll teach Wednesdays & Fridays.&nbsp; Plan music to go with it.  Thinking about evil ex-boyfriend and maybe writing a tell-all blog entry on how bad he was; deciding that gives him way more energy on my part than he deserves.  Thinking about hammocks.  Hear&nbsp;the cat's litter box (an automated one) going off and making its scraping happy noise, hoping it doesn't get clogged.  Trying to sleep.&nbsp; Thinking over and over again the word "sleep sleep sleep sleep."  When that doesn't work, try the chant:&nbsp; "Om Mani Padme Hum" (The  urlLink Jewel in the Lotus ).  Bellydance outfits I want to make.&nbsp; Silk Painting.&nbsp;   Thinking about blogging.&nbsp; Wishing I wrote like blogger A or blogger B.&nbsp; Figuring if I start doing it now, they'll totally know I ripped off their style.&nbsp; Thinking about my favorite blog entries of the past, what they had going for them.  Wondering about general health and well-being (doesn't everyone get this?)  Thinking of Friday plans.&nbsp; What kind of going-away present to get for a guy I sort of know, like as an aquaintance, but who once seemed to have a crush on me, so you don't wanna get something too personal?&nbsp; Also, what appetizer should I make to bring?  Think about junior high kids who were mean to me. Resolve to not think about that anymore.  Hear cat meow;&nbsp; listen to see if she actually has caught a bug who needs to be scooped up and rescued from her claws of torture.  Flip over on tummy.&nbsp; Feel hubby flip over on his tummy.  Wonder what hubby is thinking about.&nbsp;   Think about  urlLink Tarot  cards.*&nbsp; Want to get better at reading the whole deck, and not just the major arcana.  Think about bellydance class/troupe I want to join.&nbsp; Does the leader of the troupe remind me too much of a grad school teacher I hated?  Finally, finally, fall asleep.  Alarm clock goes off seconds later.&nbsp; (It seems that way).  Hubby says to reset it for an hour later.&nbsp; (The re-rack).  Lie there, tired.&nbsp; Plan blog entry.&nbsp; Fall asleep.&nbsp; Wake up more than an hour later cause, in resetting clock, accidentally turned volume down.   *After going to the link on Tarot cards and getting a "free reading" to a question, I am a little weirded out at what the reading seemed to imply.&nbsp; It's very interesting, the Tarot.&nbsp; If you go there, use the Celtic Cross Spread.&nbsp; :)

      Inspired by a new blogger I just discovered who writes long lists of " urlLink things she learned " from her mother & father, I was thinking of a list of things I learned from my husband.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; I know. It's entirely too romantically mushy for print.&nbsp; Maybe I won't even post it.&nbsp; But here I go on a quest for enlightenment.           I can be gorgeous and so sexy he can't keep his hands off me at 7 in the morning, even if I have kitten breath and knotted hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;  It is okay, sometimes, to be-- not rude-- but slightly short with salespeople who do not know anything and are not at all helping you.  Flying in an airplane while sudden "turbulence" bumps and jolts wiggle you back and forth is a nap-worthy event.  Freckles on a man's lips are cute as hell.  If I don't finish the ultimately soul-rending project of getting my dissertation done and my PhD in hand, I will always be mad at me.   (this when I was 21) The slightly older college professor who taught my business section of my honors class was hot.&nbsp; (And about the same age as the future-hubby).&nbsp;   I am a genius with computers.&nbsp; (comparatively speaking)  I am a genius with food.&nbsp; (with no equivocation).  I actually  can  gain weight!&nbsp; I  don't  have a "lucky" metabolism like I used to always exclaim back when I was a skinny-minnie.  The power of stubbornness.  How you never actually can say "I love you" too many times in one day.&nbsp;   That I like a man taller than me.&nbsp; Especially when doing the waltz.&nbsp; (And yes, I mean the dance.&nbsp; Not a metaphor for anything else!)   That it is totally okay to buy cut flowers for yourself.&nbsp; That guys kind of like flowers in the house too.    urlLink Casablanca  !  That farts can sometimes be totally odorless, but really, really loud.  How to box.  How to jog.&nbsp; (Still learning this one.&nbsp; Not really convinced).  That lying in a two-person hammock in the back yard, drinking frozen margaritas while our black cat sniffs grass suspiciously is better than virtually any vacation in the world.  That I could survive on my own in a big city like London, if necessary.   This one is "because" of him:&nbsp; that I am good at navigating London's "Tube."&nbsp; Like I was born to it, despite previous public transportation experience being limited mostly to Pensacola's lame bus system.  How to enjoy red wines.&nbsp; That White Granache is toilet swill.&nbsp; (It's the only wine I drank when I met him.)  That I don't like Dom Perignon, but am pretty fond of Veuve Cliquot.&nbsp; And that if you buy a bottle of Veuve and some Godiva chocolates in the duty free shop in Paris before boarding the Chunnel train, everyone else on board in your cheaper coach seats will be envious of your foresight.&nbsp; And it will be the best champagne and chocolates you've ever ever had.   That I can speak French to shopkeepers on the Left Bank, and they will gush "you would learn it in two weeks!"  That you don't actually need to speak French if you speak Texan loud enough.&nbsp; (Or else, used to be.&nbsp; Maybe nowadays it's a little different.)  That cats in different countries follow him around, and he takes cool pictures of them.  To ask to speak to the manager, without getting mad.  That I don't like men to wear cologne.&nbsp; That I prefer the way clean husband smells oh so much more.&nbsp; And yet, sometimes, I have to tell him to take a freakin' shower.   That the idea of small versions of him running around calling me "mom" is really appealing.   That even after 13 years, I can sometimes get that "first kiss" buzz when he comes in the room.  That flightsuits smell funny.&nbsp;   That most people who sell real estate are insane.  How to be a landlord.  That I really ought to want to balance my checkbook.  That I can bench press 60 pounds, five or six times.   That I love to cook for hours, just to see someone's face light up when it's really really tasty.  That he's a terrible liar.&nbsp; But which is good, cause he just doesn't do it often.  To love Willie Nelson as a God.  That a man can love peace, and want kindness always, but still be prepared to rip someone's head off if necessary to protect the ones he loves.   (Warning:&nbsp; NC 17!) That my favorite position really is missionary.&nbsp; Other variations seem like too much showing off.   How to roast one's own coffee from green coffee beans.&nbsp; That espresso is nectar of the gods.&nbsp; And 1000 dollars is not too much to pay for an  urlLink espresso machine  if you get a really good crema.   That I cannot watch the movie   urlLink Forbidden Planet   cause Leslie Neilsen in a straight roll is impossible.  It might be really cool to retire by opening a B&B in some tourist city, like maybe New Orleans.  That one can and should shave a man's back if necessary.  That everyone in the world's personality is comparable to a character from urlLink  Winnie the Pooh :&nbsp; I, myself, am a  urlLink Tigger  with  urlLink Owl  on the cusp.&nbsp; He is a  urlLink Bear , with  urlLink Rabbity  tendencies.&nbsp; My cat is a  urlLink Piglet .&nbsp; It works better than astrology.  That I love the sound of the phone ringing when it's him, calling to say he's coming home.

      How's that for an attention getter?&nbsp; :) *  I just finished finding new art for my rotating banner thing and Photoshopping them up right nice, I think.&nbsp; It's all fun clipart from the good old standby "Click Art".&nbsp; Yes, you too can find stereotyped pictures of your gender among a low cost clipart program that you can then exploit for fun and no-profit!!   There is one that I remember finding amongst a weird place in the database that I will eventually load up there.&nbsp; But I have procrastinated enough for now.&nbsp; It's time for lunch, then several hours of dissertation editing.&nbsp;   *Oh, but it's going to get me some strange hits from google!

      Oh My GOD I  urlLink wanna be pixelated .&nbsp; I really really really do.&nbsp; But I don't want to be a lame ass and write to the guy who makes this totally cool blog and say (in whiney Cartman voice)    "Chris, will you please make a pixel-picture of me?&nbsp; I mean, you totally don't know me, and you surely have important things to do, and you're cool and living in NYC and all and you probably hear this about a million times a day with lameos who can't draw asking you for free stuff but I'm totally different.&nbsp; I swear. I feed the hungry and do other charity work (like rescuing spiders from the sink on a little paper towel spidey ladder).&nbsp; I sew pants for the poor (well, Nissa, and she's not really poor, but she is broke after buying all the fabric for new pants).&nbsp; I make the world a better place by sharing my ridiculous musings with&nbsp;literally the whopping number of&nbsp;'50s' of people daily, allowing them to think, 'well, Jeez, my life sucks, but at least I'm not Kim!'&nbsp; I'm saddened by all the Democrats on TV who not only cannot dance but can't even seem to keep a beat.&nbsp; Come on people!&nbsp; You're supposed to be the hip, young party!&nbsp; What do you think, the Republicans are going to turn this mutha out?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Not happening.&nbsp; Take a dance lesson or something!&nbsp; Surely with all that voter money you folks get from us checking that little $1 donation box on our Income Tax returns you can afford to hire some dance teacher for a little afternoon class in actually clapping ON THE BEAT when the camera from CNN is on you.&nbsp; I mean, I would teach them if I were in Boston.&nbsp; Maybe they'll fly me up there for an afternoon 'breakout' session if I write them the suggestion.&nbsp; Nah.&nbsp; After all, I am registered Republican (don't ask) and I live in Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;And why the hell do presidents always carry their pets around like some sort of old lady with a poodle in a purse?&nbsp; What exactly is the pet-factor? What demographic are you trying to reach when you drag a furry little animal around getting hair all over your suits?&nbsp; Maybe my hope&nbsp;for a party with rhythm&nbsp;is with the Green party.&nbsp; Surely those hippies know how to dance.&nbsp; Who the hell are they running for president this year?&nbsp; Oscar the Grouch?&nbsp; That would be totally cool!" &nbsp; (Note that this entire paragraph was what I would write to Chris.&nbsp; See the end quotes?)    urlLink   Oh.&nbsp; I forgot the point of this blog entry in my Ulyssean rambles.&nbsp; (But note, that like the good English major I am, even with stream of consciousness typing I am using proper punctuation and capitalization and generally good spelling.&nbsp; In your face Joyce!!!!!)&nbsp; Wait. I digress again.&nbsp; Anyway.&nbsp;   I want a pixel Kim!!!!  &nbsp; What do you think it would REALLY take to get this guy  urlLink Chris DiClerico  to draw a pixelated version of me?&nbsp; Sex?&nbsp; Money?&nbsp;  urlLink All the kingdoms of the world at his command ?&nbsp; Because I'm totally prepared to make some sort of offer.&nbsp; (Oh yeah.&nbsp; And his blog is really funny, too.&nbsp; And I'm really not at all ripping off this  urlLink SOC  blog thing from  urlLink a recent blog entry .&nbsp; Really.&nbsp; I swear.).&nbsp;

      So I figured you'd be kept up all night if you didn't know how my very first aerobics teaching gig went.&nbsp; I mean, I have only taught college Engloish classes for something like 10 years, but how did I do teaching a bunch of folks how to do silly choreographed dance in order to get a sweat worked up?&nbsp;   Pretty well, I think.&nbsp; Out of the seven-ish who showed up, only one left.&nbsp; She seemed a bit on the skeptical side from the start of the class, though.&nbsp; When she realized how the warmup was going, she went and got some hand weights, like she just knew I wasn't going to work her out well enough.&nbsp; Well, she left before the warmup was done.&nbsp; Maybe she just wasn't very coordinated, and I'm too hip for her.&nbsp;   I used a fun but not too hard choreography, and aside from a couple of issues, I think all in all it was pretty okay.&nbsp; The only issues were that I got a little out of breath and with the microphone on my head, I was a bit "heavy breath-y"&nbsp; and had to take off the headset eventually.&nbsp; Then, for some weird reason my mix CD was too short!&nbsp; I had fixed up some cool music, and somewhere in the burning process, I lost two songs.&nbsp; So the class was over a little early cause I didn't have any other music.&nbsp; Not a huge loss, though.&nbsp; They were probably tired of me by then anyway.   So there you have it.&nbsp; I did it!&nbsp; :)&nbsp; From a girl who weighed almost 200 pounds about four years ago to someone who is 50 pounds lighter and teaching an aerobics class.&nbsp; In four short years.&nbsp; (It took less time than that for me to lose the weight, but it took longer for me to come to the dark side.)

      I found a repulsive website yesterday with hugely nasty hate-speech towards women on it.&nbsp; It included things like comments about women deserving to be killed (literally) for using the court system to get custody of their children.&nbsp; There was no real discussion of what the particular man was complaining about--and believe me, I am all for Father's Rights here!&nbsp; My own father was not active in my life as a child, and I firmly believe that unless there are cases of abuse, or serious criminal activity, both parents should be a part of their child's life.&nbsp; The website was just a hate-filled, nasty festival of vitriol and negativity.&nbsp;   When I signed up for my own website, oh so long ago, I signed an agreement that guaranteed that I would not put up certain content.&nbsp; This includes hate-speech.&nbsp; If I am found to have such things on my site, the company can terminate service at its discretion.&nbsp; Indeed, it is my understanding that since I agree to it in front, by signing up, they don't really even have to tell me the particulars.   Knowing this, I thought I would report said hate-speech filled website to the webserver where it was hosted.&nbsp; (And no, I will not link to this site on the blog, nor tell you its name. I will not be party to it finding more hits.)&nbsp; Generally, web servers do not know the content on their customer's websites, so a report, in my opinion, should be enough for them to take a moment, send someone out to see what's on the page, and then shut it down for being disgusting.&nbsp; It's pretty clear to me that the blatant nastiness on the website would not be considered "good" by anyone.&nbsp; Even the people who like the site have to know it's hurtful and offensive.&nbsp; That's the point of the site, in fact.&nbsp;   So today I got a legal lawyerspeak email that basically said I would have to go way out of my way by providing specific "incidents" (I had provided three direct quotes&nbsp;of the website already-- I don't know how many more they would need because it said "each incident."&nbsp; I suppose I am supposed to quote each and every page of the hateful website).&nbsp; It also basically implied that I would have to be party to even going to court for this sort of thing.   Now this just disgusts me.&nbsp; This website server host surely knows it can, and should, stop service for this a-hole's website.&nbsp; It is so beyond the pale of decent behavior that any decent person in charge would cancel it, and the general user agreements we all sign when we sign up for this sort of thing would cover the server's legal butt quite effectively, and the a-hole who owns the site would have nothing he could do about it.&nbsp; But clearly, the bragging that web servers do not tolerate hate-speech, which is illegal, is all a bunch of hot air.&nbsp;   These are probably the same kind of folks who allow spammers to fill up our mailboxes with hundreds of junk emails a day, costing businesses lots of time & energy and annoying the crap out of the world.&nbsp;   It's just not worth it to me to pursue this butthead for his nasty woman hating.&nbsp; The amount of energy it would suck from my life to go through the process this lawyer letter is demanding of me is just too big, and too much.&nbsp; It's that way on purpose, I'm sure.&nbsp;   The Wiccan rule of threefold says that anything you send out into the universe comes back to you three times.&nbsp; So you're only supposed to send out positive things, and not do any kind of harm to someone because it'll come back on you.&nbsp; I sure do here and now and in writing send this wish/prayer to him:&nbsp; may he&nbsp;and the lawyers who support his nasty, illegal activities be visited with the same sorts of energy he inflicts upon anyone who has the misfortune of stumbling upon his website.&nbsp; Threefold.

      Because the hubby is watching Fox News' coverage of the DNC this morning, I was thinking about presidents. It occurred to me to think of the age differences at election of Reagan & Clinton. So I looked them up on the Internet. While doing so, I was sucked into (as congenital academics are prone to being) trivia on Presidents of the U.S. One fact on a  urlLink page of trivia  caught my eye:   John Quincy Adams customarily took a nude early morning swim in the Potomac River. Anne Royall, the first U.S. professional journalist, knew of his 5 a.m. swims. After being refused interviews with the president time after time, she went to the river, gathered his clothes and sat on them until she had her interview. Before this, no female had interviewed a president.  Look at that!&nbsp; Can you imagine?&nbsp; I mean, Adams could have avoided her by breaking the rules of etiquette and "female sensibilities" by just getting out of the water.&nbsp; But she won because she used the rules for herself instead of against her.&nbsp; Anne Royall sounded like an interesting woman, who I'd never heard about before.&nbsp; So I  urlLink looked her up .   She was called "an uncommon scold."&nbsp; People apparently were not fond of her because she went after politicians, fraud, government corruption.&nbsp; She was opposed to slavery, but disliked the zealotry of abolitionists.&nbsp; She was opposed to liquor, but against the way temperance advocates went about it.&nbsp; So even in her causes, she pissed people off.&nbsp; What a woman to admire!&nbsp; I took one Journalism class in college, but I never heard of her.&nbsp; The first woman reporter I ever heard of was  urlLink Ida B. Wells  (who is pretty impressive too).&nbsp; I wonder, are there any of ya'll out there who are Journalists who took a class where you heard of Anne Royall?&nbsp; This is a woman that I think people ought to know about.&nbsp;   (Insert random weird connection here) I mean, folks criticize reporters like Bill O'Reilly for being a jerk and just seem to passionately hate him-- but there's a long history of people not liking reporters who just speak their minds and don't take any flak.&nbsp; (I have to say, I'm not a big fan of O'Reilly, but I'm glad folks like him are out there to bring through a certain perspective).&nbsp;   Anyway.&nbsp; I can't help it but be a bit of a teacher sometimes.&nbsp; So here ya go.&nbsp; Your history lesson of the day.

      Jeez.  I just read probably the most terrifying article I have read probably ever.  It makes me think of how laissez-faire I've been about flying for a long time, and now I'm a little freaked out.  I don't know how I would have responded to the situation described in this woman's narrative.   The article is a little long, and reading it aloud to my sister, I felt choked up a few times and had to take a moment.  urlLink Read it yourself  and see what you think.  And be prepared for a sick feeling in your stomach all day.     UPDATE:  I had a conversation with the hubby about this at lunch and we both were skeptical.  I mean, why in the world would an incident like this happen and major news media NOT pick it up?  We have every news outlet scrambling for stories, and the biggest news right now is the DNConvention, and this would be huge.  The magazine where this was first published has links to other articles that have followed up on the story of a flight where a reporter felt herself to possibly be on "the next 9/11" and there are interesting facts coming up.  I asked my friend the pilot if he'd ever heard of this kind of situation happening, been briefed about it.  And he said that yes, in a training video, this sort of situation was covered, but that there wasn't really a specific briefing on a recent incident.    What I think the entire thing shows is that fear and paranoia are working against another sort of fear and paranoia-- we're afraid that we're racist, and afraid that we're paranoid, and we're also afraid that there might be a good reason to be afraid.  It's difficult stuff to deal with.  Jacobson's  urlLink second discussion  of this incident speculates more on this, too.  I was getting on a flight out of Salt Lake City when a man complained loudly that they weren't letting him take 3 carryon pieces, and he claimed he had been doing so for several flights and was mad that the woman at SLC was NOT letting him continue breaking the rules.  He seemed to think that they were targeting him-- and yes, he was perhaps Indian (that's what his accent sounded like to me, and I know a few Indian folks, so I think I may have been right).  He said loudly that he was writing a letter.  And I thought, as  urlLink some of these articles  that are the followup to  Annie Jacobsen's on Women's Wall Street have pointed out, that if the guy had been any other ethnicity, perhaps a big blond German guy, we would have all just thought "what a jerk."    I also remembered one day when I was being bumped from a flight and the guy who had missed the flight that had just left was rude to the gate agents and they said they were "attaching a note" to his record.  He sounded a lot like a Cajun (someone from Louisiana). Does ethnicity have to matter or does just plain "being rude" cover it?  Does someone who is that rude indeed "get a note attached?"  Rude is different from scary.  But it's all really terrifying, and I am definitely afraid that our illusion of safety is just that:  an illusion.  but fear is definitely amuck.  And the biggest fear is definitely that we are out of control of our own fates.  And mostly, we are.  But as said pilot friend of mine also pointed out, it would be far easier to blow up, say, a shopping mall, or a movie theater, or a .....  you enter unsecured place with lots of people here.  This is something that is unfortunately now a part of our lives.  And if some folks obsess over it, then maybe some aren't worried enough about it.  Remember the guy who got all that stuff aboard a  urlLink Southwest Airlines Flight ?   He was just pointing out breaches in security.    I don't mean to fear monger or anything.  But it still makes me a wee bit sad that we feel we have to worry about these issues, and suspicious that some people who are declaring Jacobson a bigot for being afraid are doing so because they "doth protest too much" and have been afraid themselves.

      I do.  Here's why.  (It's a creepy story, so be prepared.)    When I was about 13, we lived in a trailer on the property of my mother's boyfriend's job-- which was a big trucking company.  One of the employees (we found out later) was an ex-con, who had been in prison for rape.  I remember once in my youthful enthusiasm, I had happily hugged him (again, we didn't know he was a rapist).  But even then, right as I hugged him, my nascent instincts about creepy men kicked in and I saw a funny look on his face and avoided him from then on.   We had this beautiful Doberman Pinscher named (can you guess?) Angel.  She was one of the red Doberman's, and she was my sweet best friend.  She had been abused by her former owner, and because we were kind and loving, she adored us.  She would spin and leap happily whenever I came home from school.  If you've ever seen a Doberman run flat out at top speed, you know how gorgeous an animal happy with life can be-- they look like speed personified.  (They are bred partly from Greyhounds and you give them room and they will sprint like there's no tomorrow).    Angel liked to sleep in the doorway of my bedroom.  One night, I was awoken by the sound of her yelping slightly to see her standing firmly in the door, with the look of permanent unbudging determination that said "Okay, buddy, you've got about ten seconds to live if you even think about trying it."  The guy, I'll call him Zeke (since that actually was his name-- hey, I'm not protecting the bastard here!) was standing in front of her, hand out in that supplicating "please don't eat me" way that people tend to respond to Dobermans with their temper up.  Angel didn't bark, she didn't rip his throat out, but there was the distinct impression that she would be glad to at any time.  I realize in retrospect that my response to the situation was problematic-- Zeke said "sshhhhh" and "go back to sleep" and I did.  Nothing untoward happened to me.  Angel prevented him from entering my room, but she was a shy dog, and not trained to chase him off (he was, after all, a normal person to be on the property, so not exactly a stranger to her.)    My sister, who is seven years older than me and was sleeping on the couch, woke to find Zeke hovering on top of her.  She told him if he didn't get off, she would kill him.  Now, you have to realize that if my sister told you that, you would (and should) believe her.  She is not at all shy, and would definitely carry out her threat (make that promise).  He did-- he left, and was not seen again.  (I don't know if he quit his job, or was fired, or what, but I never did see him again).  My sister  is  kind of a heavy sleeper, though, and when she finally got up the next morning, she found that her underwear was gone.  Nothing happened to her other than that "attempt" and we sort of wrote it off as a weird event that was fairly harmless. (Again, now, in retrospect, I would be calling the cops if it were my daughters telling this story to me the next morning, if only to keep my husband from going after the bastard with his well-polished Glock, but I think that's the issue with a lot of these cases-- people don't always realize how they should respond).  Angel was hit by a car and killed not very long after this incident.  It was a heart-breaking moment and I saw it happen and cried for a very long time.    But here's the point.  I am quite certain that if I had been the one to wake up with Zeke actually  in  my bedroom, given that I was young and used to  minding  adults, I'm not sure what would have happened.  Angel firmly kept him out of my room, and my sister could handle herself.  There are other things that would have been nice if they had happened, like Angel actually ripping his throat out.  But that's what Angels do, right, they protect, but they don't actually inflict harm.  Then, after saving me from a painful terrible event, she was sent back to wherever Angels hang out when they aren't in bodily mortal form.    I like to think that she's my guardian still today.  I have a particular fondness for red Doberman's.  It's possible I may get one myself one day, especially if I have a daughter who might need some firm protection.  Of course, I plan to teach a future daughter's Angel to not be so gentle when assholes who don't belong somewhere show up.  In the future, any man who doesn't belong in my home will be finding his balls as a new form of Alpo.

       You might have wondered why I didn't post a blog entry yesterday.  I was very very busy, gentle readers.  Early in the morning, my friend Nissa and I went off to the park for the Bedouin Dance Troupe's "Gypsy Fair" which meant dancing and buying cute bellydance stuff.  We sweated for a little while there, did some dancing and chatting and photo ops, and then headed for a friend's birthday party, which consisted of some BBQ and then the rest of the day at Six Flags Fiesta Texas.  We were done with our day's events by about 11:30 pm after having left the house at 10 am.  LONNNNNG day!  But the day did end with some lovely Italian Gelato at DaVinci's in Stone Oak.    Since people are usually interested in photos, though, I'm posting a few of my favorites here in the blog.  You can also see more if you go to the ofoto gallery  urlLink here .  Most of these are of the other folks at the fair, though.  I'm a fabulous photo taker, you know.  :)  I'm planning to begin going to the Bedouin's classes, and try to get myself to be invited to become a member of the troupe.  If the leader likes my dancing, she'll eventually invite me to do so.  It appeals to my inner drag queen to actually perform, and learn choreography and my current teacher isn't interested in doing that sort of thing.  So I'm trying to get in with a crowd that does this stuff regularly.  Plus, the classes for the Bedouin group are something like three hours long usually, which means a lot more exercise benefit from the dancing.     That is the thing, and a few folks have said that all the stuff I do inspires them to think of exercising.  I  hate  to exercise, but I love to do fun things, and if you can find things (dancing, roller skating, hiking, bikes, etc) that you find fun that also burn those calories, you can still eat cheesecake and pizza AND be slim and healthy.  So that's the goal-- find more activities to do that will burn the calories I dearly love to consume.    The costume-making frenzy I've been on for the last week has resulted in:  three new pairs of harem pants for me, three new pairs for Nissa, and a plan to make a few more things, including a skirt, and to try to learn to make cholis-- which are the top you wear with bellydance outfits when you're not wearing a fancy shmancy coin or beaded bra.  The pattern looks easy, but I am a mere beginner in the sewing department.  I love how this new red costume turned out.  The shades of red are my favorites, and I think it looks pretty flattering on me.  This picture is pretty decent, too-- I am trying to learn how to pose in pictures so I don't look like a total doofus-- I usually hate pictures that people take of me because I don't like the expression on my face, or I think I look fat, or whatever.  You know what I mean, and if you don't, and are one of those lucky photogenic people, then never mind!  Today's events include a trip to Canyon Lake for Andrew's sister's birthday, which will also mean some kayaking.  Fun in the sun, and I don't even have a sunburn (which is a real feat of modern technology & SPF 30something, because I am prone to being a crispy kritter, what with the red hair and freckles and all.    So my suggestion to you, if you're reading this, get out of the house!  Go do something fun today!  Don't spend all day looking at a computer screen for  urlLink Lakshmi's  sake!

      First off, where do you think the practice of adding "schm" to something to make fun of it comes from?   I dunno.  I'll bet somewhere there's a website that explains it, but I'm not going to look it up right now.  Lazy?  Yes.  It's in the blog title, after all.  (Well, procrastination is a form of laziness).   But second, I edited my intro chapter a bunch just now and I have a crick in my neck to prove it.  I went through the suggestions from my committee chair and clarified more, and fiddled and faddled.  I now have a ton of typing changes to do.  That takes a certain kind of patience in a 40 something page document, so I predict it will not happen today.  But still, good work done on the chapter.  I am hoping that the changes I have made make my chair happy.  Please Goddess!  (I should talk to  urlLink Hecate  about this probably, since she's often been seen as a witch goddess.)    I used the word "Patriarchy" a lot today.  I generally try to avoid blaming all the evils of the world on men and/or patriarchy, but in a feminist dissertation, it's pretty hard to avoid.  The places where I added it, I had sort of been wishy-washily implying the word, but that just didn't wash with my advisor.  I must bang the drum of academic feminism and use words like "epistemology" and "patriarchy" and maybe even phallogocentrism*.  Yes.  That's a word.  Look it up.  I have a sore neck and can't be bothered to find a link.  (I would have said a stiff neck, but that would just be funny, from the perspective of the word I just used.)    *I was hoping spell-check would have an interesting suggestion for replacing this word.  It did not.  It was just a blank "hey, this word is wrong" pop up.  Sad for me to know things that are pointless in most conversational arenas.  :)

      It's amazing that you can watch bad TV for hours sometimes.  I have only watched this for thirty minutes-ish, but I really like the show "Made."  Right now is the episode where this chorus girl wants to join the hiphop dance team.  I don't know why I am so fascinated by this silly MTV show.  There's just something interesting about people stretching their boundaries, trying something totally alien to their personality.    Perhaps it's also that I have  other things to do .  I really ought to be doing real work.  But it's just so important that I see how this chubby chick does in getting that "hip-hop" flava.

      I'm working on my "teaching routine" for my new gig as an aerobics instructor.  Next week on Tuesday I'll teach my first ever class, subbing for another teacher.  It's a "hi-lo" class, which means basically traditional "floor" aerobics, like line dancing, only cooler.  Today I worked out the moves, based on a routine I learned many years ago.  But what about the music?  It takes a lot to figure that out if you're doing it yourself instead of buying the "Ready made" mixes available out there.  I don't like the ready mades cause they often are "covers" and not the original artist.  So today I've been practicing teaching my aerobics class to imaginary students, (and they got it on the first or second try, max, except for one imaginary chick at the back of the class who kept giving me 'tude, rolling her eyes and acting too cool for me.  I hope she goes to another imaginary class from now on.)  And I've made a mix of cool music that works with the routine.  But the first two mixes I made didn't quite work, based on beats per minute or other things, like the burning program didn't "crossfade" the songs together and there was a 2 second gap between them-- and two seconds is a long time for silence in an aerobics class.    Phew.  I'm tired!  I worked out my regular 45 minutes of exercise, then I did it all again practicing to my imaginary class.  I'm going to be soooo buff when I get this gig going every week.  :)

      I just finished sewing the final touches on MY costume for Saturday.  It's a "shades of red" bellydance outfit, which will go nicely with my  urlLink new coin belt & bra combo  from way back when.  The second pair of pants went ever so much easier, although I did have a moment where I had sewn one leg on inside out.  But I fixed it fairly easily after some paint-peeling curse words.  Now I am mostly ready for "Gypsy Fair in the Park" on Saturday.  Nissa's costume is mostly sewn; she'll just have to come over for final adjustments & additions to the pretty pants I sewed her.   Now it's off to aerobics to learn a routine that I'm going to have to teach next week.  I kind of have a headache, though, so I don't know if I'm going to be very happy in the class.  Holy Cow, is it really that late?! I actually should be there right this second.  Hmmm.  Given that I won't be able to make it through traffic, I may have to re-adjust my plans somewhat.  I knew my feeling of accomplishment just in time was too good to be true.!!!!  My kitchen clock is an hour behind, darn it.    Oh well.  I'll write the person who I'm supposed to meet an email that I have had a problem.... there's still several days to go to her class before I have to teach it.  ::smacks head in annoyance::

      I'm sewing new bellydancing pants for myself & my friend Nissa today.  We have a "thing" to go to on Saturday.  For some reason it is NOT going well.  I think it's the fabric I'm using; it's kind of weird, with gold metal things sewn into the fabric, and it's hard to work with.  So I'm getting really cranky.  It might just be one of those things, like some days you are clumsy and weird about things you normally can do just fine.  I've made several pairs of these pants in the past with no problems and today things are just going wrong-- easy things, like thread issues.  ::sigh:: I've also made a couple of annoying mistakes; things that if you do yourself, you just go "oh well."  But if you were to buy something this way, you'd be mad.  So Nissa, just love me anyway.  :)    In a comment, Terry said he was much more a "dog person" than a cat person cause cats are snooty & independent.    I know everyone says this, but  my  cat is different.    She's not at all snooty & too independent.  Yes, she's okay spending time by herself and doesn't need attention all the time, but she comes running when we come home (after a sufficient gap to make sure it's us and not the boogeyman before she pops out from whatever thing she's under cause she's a scaredeycat.)  She's very talkative-- will gab your ear off while you're feeding her, or if you say "hey, Tituba, what'd you do today."  Seriously.  She talks back (sure, it's meowing, but it's friendly and sounds like a conversation.)  She's also not generally snooty-- she's very sweet.  I think most cats are snooty & not friendly because that's the way their owners treat them.  I had a room mate in college whose cat was more a stereotypical cat, and it was mostly because she had gotten the cat at the same time she got a dog and paid more attention to the dog.    Anyway.  Slight diversion cause I needed a break from sewing the pants from hell.

        I had to pop in to Petsmart last night because  the precious  (say that with a Gollum like tone) Tituba is on a persnickity period of ONLY eating fish flavored foods (including Ocean Fish & Catfish) and she was all out.  While there, I found this faboolous cat toy.  If you want one yourself and don't know if your local pet store has them, go to  urlLink this here  website.  They also have George W. and Hillary.    How does the cat like it?  Well, she was sitting on the floor with the Arnold next to a paw, and I pestered her about it.  It's filled with catnip, and she sniffed it a bit, whacked it once or twice with a vague paw, and started to try to chew on its head.  I figured hillarity would ensue moments later as my kitty clawed the Terminator and carried him around the house in her mouth (which you know is the point of making these toys-- tormenting politicians in effigy is good clean fun).  But she couldn't get a good grip on the head and just decided to go have some more catfish instead.  Just before abandoning the toy in favor of a little snack, she scowled at me, and gave me a meow which seemed to say "Moooommm, I can't be expected to perform tricks on command!"* Poor thing.    *yes, I am one of those people who thinks of her cat like a baby, and insist in conversation that she's calling me "mom" and Andrew "dad."  Deal with it.

      We're home.  Yay!  We've had pizza and fresh peaches we bought at a roadside stand outside of Palestine, TX.  Yum.  I've made a command decision-- I will go on the "no liquor for 6 weeks" boot camp diet to lose the pounds I've gained since I've been being bad lately.  So tonight I made Andrew make me a nice martini.  Last time I did the boot camp, I lost 30 pounds.  I don't need to lose that many now, but a few.  :)  Random stuff.  More tomorrow.

      So tomorrow, we'll be driving back to San Antonio.  I'm really ready to be back in my own house, my own bed, with my own gym to go to and my own cool backyard.  I have things to do!  It's a long drive, and we're leaving around noon, so I'll probably not have time to post a blog entry tomorrow.  I'm very glad that I got my laptop with the wireless capabilities before this long stay here, though; I really miss having the Internet available when I don't have it.    Yesterday, I may have come to a good breakthrough on writing the intro chapter of my dissertation.  I have been mulling over the advice my director gave me since I got the revisions back a while ago, and thinking of how to make the changes she suggested and get that chapter more organized and clear.  It's a process that actually takes longer and is harder than anything I've ever done before-- and I've written thousands of essays in my academic career!  But after I left the coffee shop, I went back to our hotel and Andrew was ready for a nap.  I was not sleepy (remember, 40 oz of latte a day keeps the sandman away).  So I was just keeping him company and the Muse of Inspiration popped in for a little chat.  She explained what is now a very simple solution that I am amazed I hadn't thought of before-- it's always so much simpler after you think of it, but it seems so obvious that I can't imagine it was hard.  So I hopped up and wrote frantically for a little over an hour, reorganizing, adding and subtracting and clarifying.  I hope that it turns out to be as good as I think it is right now-- it's very hard to tell on a computer screen.  I need to print up the writing and read it all, but then perhaps I will send it back to my advisor soon again.  It would be SOOOO nice if it is to a stage where she accepts it, and we send it to the rest of the committee, cause then the rest of the dissertation would totally be downhill.  We shall see.  Maybe my task is not so hopeless as it sometimes seems.    Anyhoo.  That's the news on this front.  My ears are clogged and I keep getting a sharp-ish pain in my left one-- I hope I'm not getting infected to the point where I need to go to a doctor, because, dear readers, with me as perpetual grad student who isn't also teaching, I do not have insurance.  Sigh.  It's always something, isn't it?  Maybe getting back to my home-allergens will clear me up.  Here's hoping.    I'll try hard to think of something inspiring and meaningful to write next time, more along the lines of parable and/or metaphor.  This is all autobiography that probably doesn't inspire anyone to anything other than being grateful you're not in grad school too.    Finally, at the coffee shop, where I'm at right now, there's a little girl of about six or so playing in the "kid's" section of the shop.  She's playing happily, but it means she's screaming at some game.  Literally screaming.  And it is happy scream, the sort that moms probably don't even hear anymore cause it's just the kid playing make-believe and perhaps her little dolls are fighting dragons or something.  But to a person with no kids, I tell ya, it's deafeningly loud and annoying.  Just in case you were wondering.  I don't mean to be a grumpy pants but for Freya's sake, lady, tell her to keep it down to an "inside voice" wouldya?

      Oh!&nbsp; I just read on  urlLink another blog  that  urlLink Paula Danziger died last week !!&nbsp; She was one of my favorite writers when I was a teen, and she apparently died very suddenly.&nbsp; This makes me very sad.&nbsp; It's much&nbsp; more important to post a link about this writer than to fish for pointless blog hits by mentioning that tennis chick in the last post.&nbsp; I feel sad now.&nbsp; No wonder I'm in a goth mood today!&nbsp; Books by Danziger that made my pre-teen life happier:  urlLink The Cat Ate My Gymsuit   urlLink There's a Bat in Bunk Five    urlLink The Pistachio Prescription   urlLink Can You Sue Your Parents for Malpractice?  I can't say which of them were my absolute favorites.  I also seem to remember reading more books by her, but they weren't listed on Amazon.  Probably they are all out of print, because after all, I'm very old, and was a pre-teen ages and ages ago.  But if you never read anything by her, and/or if you have a pre-teen girl who likes to read, get something by her.  They're funny, without being smart alecky in a negative way, they have very interesting female protagonists, and the situations are often some that kids actually are going through.    I can't speak for her more recent work since I haven't read anything by her in a couple of years (cough. cough) but I really do recommend her stuff.  And pass a sad moment of remembering a writer that meant a lot to a young girl who didn't have much in the way of good things in her life, and who read these books voraciously.

      I can't tell you how much it means to me when that little script that shows how many people are currently reading my blog reads more than 1... yesterday, at one point, there were 4 people online at my blog!&nbsp; (That means 3 plus me, actually, but still!)&nbsp; It's probably silly of me to worry about whether people are reading what is really supposed to just be a journal that keeps me writing every day, and isn't really meant to be anything all that serious.&nbsp; But it's sort of like I got invited to sit at a lunch table with people, rather than having to sit over in the corner next to the geek table where they all have bag lunches filled with day old little Debbie snack cakes.&nbsp; (And the thing is that even at the geek table, they had friends to sit with....)&nbsp; But then, J will be brutal and say that I did have a table to go to-- with her, and La, and sometimes other folks.&nbsp; But not always, dear love.&nbsp; There was a time when I had to attach myself to the table where the evil ex boyfriend sat, and tortured me.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Anyway.&nbsp; That was a bit of a digression and it's a little pathetic.&nbsp; If I wasn't so honest with me I would delete it and you guys wouldn't see what a big lame old sillyface I am, and now I'm probably losing even more cool points and there'll never be 4 online again...&nbsp; sigh.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Apparently I'm having a goth moment.&nbsp; If I weren't wearing a hot pink lacy bra and cute flowery sundress and pink toenails &amp; fingernails I might believe that better.&nbsp; What a poser I am!   Last night, the sweet baboo and I watched  urlLink  Cold Mountain  .&nbsp; An excellent movie!&nbsp; I have this tendency to figure out which character in the movie I am most like, or would be most like, in the unlikely event that I were to wake up tomorrow and live during the Civil War era.&nbsp; I identified most with Ruby, the Rene Z. character (I am not even going to  TRY  spelling her last name).&nbsp; Given my background, and growing up poor and being feisty and independent I am certainly not like Nicole Kidman's character.&nbsp; Although I am more intellectual than Ruby.&nbsp; So in a way, perhaps I'd be a cross between the two.&nbsp; But then, given the whole imaginary scenario of living back then, I wouldn't get to go to college and learn all kinds of stuff, so my little hypotheses falls apart.&nbsp; So the moral of this story is,  Cold Mountain  is a good movie, worth watching, not too far into the "girly chick movie" but also not totally depressing and prone to make you need to think happy thoughts in order to not hate the world later.&nbsp; (Yes, there are some sad things.&nbsp; But it's more about the strength of the characters than the bad parts).&nbsp; So watch it, if only to see Rene purse her little beestung lips all cute-like.&nbsp; (Cause believe me you, that is worth the rental price itself.&nbsp;  urlLink She's just an adorable little thing ).&nbsp;   Finally, I am having another moment here.... in the Internet cafe, there is another grad student, who is working on her Master's Degree* (in physics, no less!), and she is here to research and work like a good little graduate student, as I too should be doing.&nbsp; And she, like me, spent a while checking email and stuff.&nbsp; But now, she's being all good and reading articles and research and LEARNING stuff, while I am goofing off.&nbsp; So I need to get my butt in gear and get some real work done.&nbsp; Begging won't do you any good.&nbsp; I've written enough.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; But I do love you all, and that's not just the latte talking.&nbsp;   *But if it makes me feel any better, I can say when I was working on my Master's Degree, I was a lot better at self-motivating too.&nbsp; And if I were writing that, I'd be almost done by now, cause I have written almost as much on the PhD dissertation as was my  urlLink final product for the MA .&nbsp; SO there.

      Okay.&nbsp; So I'm sitting here in my little favorite coffee shop browsing the links on my blogrolling list.&nbsp; Having a good time.&nbsp; And there's this group of ladies in here that I can't help but comment on cause they're funny!&nbsp; They're chattering away, and it's all about stuff I shouldn't be eavesdropping on, but they keep making me smile secretly.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Things I've overheard:   "Sticky bun, cinammon bun, somebody's bun"  "We don't even get the paper 'cause we can't read."  "We've got to eat right or our Itallian butts will get huge"  "You really are on my ass today, aren't you? (spoken to the older lady, who apparently is the mom of the two younger ones.)    All in cute little southern bell accents.&nbsp; Don't tell them I'm listening in and writing about them.&nbsp; :)

      For the last week, I've had a stuffy head from allergy-type issues.&nbsp; It's very frustrating-- my ears are clogged and do that little popping thing when you swallow.&nbsp; Yesterday, while driving, I had a moment of vertigo that made me seriously think for a sec that I needed to pull over (one more instant of the feeling &amp; I would have).&nbsp; It was scarey!&nbsp; My sweet baboo (hubby) is also feeling crappy.&nbsp; I think it has to do with the heat, or something; it's making the little trees &amp; molds and grasses and things release their&nbsp;happy little sexuality into the air (in other words, pollen).&nbsp; The aviator ditched his airplane ride today cause his head is so clogged;  urlLink Oshun  knows that he shouldn't fly with his ears that stopped up.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  It feels a bit like I'm swimming underwater.&nbsp; So if my fingers seem prune-y, that's why.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Someone asked in the comments what I'm doing here in "cowboy land."&nbsp; Dear gentle readers, I'm always in cowboy land!&nbsp; I live right in the heart of it: San Antonio.&nbsp; We hardly ever see folks running around with cowboy hats and spurs in San Antonio (I hear it's more common up by Dallas) but it   is   deep in the heart of.....&nbsp;&nbsp; San Antonio has a very old-world Mexico-ish feel.&nbsp; There are lovely missions, and cactus is the operative shrubbery for landscaping (most folks use 100-year plants alot and lantana and butterfly bush too).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  I like San Antonio-- I've never lived very long in any particular place (Florida gets 2nd place in longevity of me living there) but people are really nice in  urlLink San Antonio .&nbsp; I like the bi-lingual-ness, although I don't speak Spanish very well (I understand more than I speak).&nbsp; And honestly, we are the  urlLink eighth largest city  in the country!&nbsp; You can get good Greek food (Mina &amp; Dimi's Greek house on the south side) good Nuevo Latino (Azuca's downtown-- ooh the mojitos) good Indian (India Oven) good Sushi (all over town!) and/or any other great food you might want, any day of the week.&nbsp; Great martinis downtown at the Zinc bar, and occasionally, a celebrity sighting in folks who live here like Tommy Lee Jones or one of the Spurs or Jerri Hall.&nbsp; We also get pretty much all of the bit music/rock concert tours (I live close enough to the outdoor arena that when Aerosmith came to town, I could hear them singing cause I had my windows open).&nbsp;&nbsp; We have a Macy's, and a Saks, and most importantly, a Williams Sonoma.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; So we aren't exactly backwardsville or Hell (although it's sometimes as hot as).&nbsp;Whenever I drive through smalltowns on the way back to Florida, I&nbsp;always think of how I wouldn't want to live in such a tiny little place, where the best place to shop is Wal Mart (nothing against the store, but I need  at least  a Target....)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  And man, you can get some incredible, better-than-sex Mexican food 'round these parts, too.&nbsp; And the margaritas!&nbsp; Oi Oi Oi!&nbsp; But that makes me sad cause I usually do margaritas on Friday night and we're not going to do that tonight.&nbsp; Sigh.&nbsp; We'll be home in San Antonio on late late Monday night.&nbsp; So whatever you think about Texas, if you've never been here, don't believe the negative stuff you hear.&nbsp; Yes, there have been some bad things happen, but those happen everywhere.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  But right now, I'm a bit east in Shreveport, La, cause Andrew is doing his yearly obligation of Air Force Reserve duty.&nbsp; Which consists mostly of sitting in an office drinking bad coffee, and occasionally flying around in a big old airplane.&nbsp; Poor baby hasn't had a day off since the 5th.&nbsp; (And that includes weekends!)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Someone also asked about my dissertation.&nbsp; I'm working on a dissertation on witches in contemporary fiction, TV &amp; film, and discussing how the representations show/teach a kind of feminism. The texts I'm writing about:    urlLink Buffy the Vampire Slayer    the   urlLink Witches of Eastwick   (book &amp; movie)   urlLink  Cat's Eye   by Margaret Atwood    urlLink White as Snow  &nbsp; by Tanith Lee    urlLink Practical Magic   by Alice Hoffman (&amp; movie too)    urlLink Mistress of Spices   by Chitra Divakaruni    urlLink Brown Girl in the Ring   by Nalo Hopkinson   urlLink  Galveston   by Sean Stewart Yes, you can write an academic dissertation and get a PhD (theoretically; haven't done it yet, but it's possible) on such fun topics.&nbsp;*  &nbsp;  So that's probably way more information than you needed today.&nbsp; But now I feel my duty has been done.&nbsp; I've defended my hometown, discussed my various physical impairments, and my dissertation.&nbsp; (Which I don't believe I'm going to work on much today-- I wrote on it yesterday and the muse has left the building today).&nbsp; Now, for another 20 oz of Latte, and maybe browse some of my bloglist.&nbsp; :)&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Oh, is anybody going to see any good movies this weekend?&nbsp; I don't care what they say, I want to see  urlLink  I, Robot ,  and  urlLink  Catwoman   (I know, that second one's not out yet).&nbsp;  &nbsp;  *Just FYI:&nbsp; all the links to amazon are through my "associates" account, which, if you do decide to buy one of those texts, will help support my  urlLink womenwriters  website hosting fees.&nbsp; I don't make money on them, exactly, cause I pay more than I ever get in referrals.&nbsp; But just so's you know.&nbsp; You can read more about it  urlLink here .&nbsp;

      Just a note while I'm here at the coffee shop:  1.  Ladies (especially) and gentlemen:  please do not bathe in perfume (aftershave).  If you can smell your little "spritz" all day, you probably are putting too much on.  There is a conventional wisdom that you dab cologne on the spots that you want someone to nuzzle, kiss.  If you can smell them without being THAT close to you, then it's too much.  It makes me physically naseous to smell someone's strong perfume, and that makes being in a public place next to you (six feet away damnit) while your stinky musky old lady cologne wafts into my space PAINFUL TO ME.  I am not just saying this to be picky.  It really does make me feel ill to smell these strong scents.  I am not at all alone-- I have a slight sensitivity to smells brought on over the years partly because of hormone therapies, but probably just a natural thing too.   2.  If you're enjoying your frozen whipped cream coffee drink in a public place, try to contain your moans of "mmmm" and slurpy noisy lip-smacking pleasure.  Keep it down to, say, one when you first start drinking.  If I have to smell your stinky perfum AND hear your enjoyment of a mere coffee drink which rivals the sounds made by your basic porn queen, I'm going to get really cranky and start writing about you in my blog.    Just FYI.

      That's what they call it here.  I guess cause it's right on the border of the three states.  It's not so bad, but it's freakin'* hot!!!!  I'm trying to stay inside as much as possible, although Andrew made me jog yesterday.  Blech!  I did try hard not to wimp out, but by the end, I was mostly walking cause I was getting a major headache.    I'm back in the coffee shop again.  Maybe I oughta put in an application or something, since I'm here so much.  :)  It's really funny listening to people come in and ask for stuff, and be totally confused about espresso drinks (what is the difference between a cappucino and a latte?  Do you know?  I do, but most people don't).  It's cute.  I'm not making fun of the espresso-challenged.  You'll learn.  But stop drinking those horrible frozen things with tons of whipped cream, for Yemaya's sake!  (See.  I know other names of gods than what I listed earlier!!) (Unless of course you're skinny as a rail.  Then have two of them, and eat a sandwich, too.  You can afford the calories).    I'm trying really hard to figure out how to word my dissertation introduction so that I am making my argument clear.  I think I might have something right now that will do it-- it's been sorta vague so far, but I got an idea while I was half-napping a little bit ago.  So this is just a short "I'm still here" kind of post. I answered some questions and issues people raised in the comments to the bee post (which some of you really liked!  I'm happy!  I like getting comments!!)    Now I need to get to writin' 'bout witches.  :)   *for adventures in "spell check"-- it wants to change "freakin'" to foreskin.  Funny suggestion, that.  :)

      Sunday afternoon, the hubby and I decided to make use of the hotel's pool for a little refreshing dip.  When we got there, I spotted a little European Honeybee struggling in the water.  I hate to see any life extinguished for no real good reason, so I had the hubby scoop her out of the water.  She fell back in the pool.  Scooped her out again, and set her on the other side of the pool (it seems to me that bees follow a path, and anything in that path will not distract them from that particular orientation-- including our house, or a pool).  The little bee sat on the concrete pool gate for a while, drying herself out, wiggling her wings, and generally recovering from her dip in the chlorinated water.  She wasn't really doing great, and tried to fly too soon and fell the ground.  I don't think that did her any good-- she lay there, twitchy and wiggly.  We left before I saw if she actually made it or not.  The point I wanted to make isn't totally depressing, but a little sad, I guess.  I was amazed at the persistence she showed-- no matter what, she just kept trying to make it.  Even when the odds were against her, (she was NOT getting out of that pool without "divine intervention"-- i.e., someone to scoop her out).  She also kept failing, however.  Each "salvation"-- each time someone outside her helped her, she would bumble into another trap of some sort.  I thought about God, (Goddess, or whatever else you want to call the great organizing principle of the universe) and how we sometimes pray to get out of situation one only to fall into yet another bad situation.  And we think "why won't God (Buddha, Kuan Yin, Kali, Astarte) help us?"  But we don't always realize maybe someone DID help us, but we just kept on the path we were on and fell into yet another dangerous place.    I mean, life, ultimately, is a tragedy.  No one's getting out of this thing alive.  You extend any story out far enough, and it gets sad.  Triumph after triumph is only ONE ending-- we have other endings and fates in store for us.    But that's the sad part.  The happy part is this-- we have to keep going and going and sometimes the help we get we don't see.  We should, however, examine the paths we are on to see if maybe there is a "water hazard" ahead.  Persistence is a good thing.  If you fall on your back, use those wings to flip yourself over.  Crawl out of the puddle of chlorine.  Wiggle and dry those wings.  But before you go flying off the high places, make sure those wings are ready.  Heal first.  Think.  Eventually, there are flowers for any bee to visit.    (Feeling introspective much?  Yes.  Well I could have written about my day yesterday where the best thing I did was watch several hours of the Surreal Life 2.  Nah.  Let's just stick with the bee story).

      Okay, the extra exclamation points were not an accident.  I am supremely caffeinated!  I am now on my SECOND 20 oz latte at this lovely little Internet Cafe in Shreveport, La.*   But the first one tasted really good, and I ordered another, and now I'm thinking maybe that was more than I really needed.  :)  But that's alright.  Expect dispatches to come from here for the next ten days (ish).  Some days I may not be able to drag Andrew over here, and/or just be busy.  But the wireless connection works just fine, and I'm very happy.  This was the shop that started me on my little quest to get the new laptop (Pele!) and it works just fine.  For half a sec when I first got here I was worried, cause the little indicator bubble that says "Wireless connection available" did not come up.  But it did after a minute.  So.      Now I'm grooving with my Real Player, which I loaded with about forty CDs last week, (for some reason my Rhapsody service won't work here.... I don't know why, but I don't really mind).  Annabelle the Sheep is grooving away to the soundtrack from  The Craft -- I totally love it when she gets  the backup singers.  :)    The coffee making clerk is a cute blonde high school girl who was despairing earlier cause someone called her "Ma'am."  I told her that I remember my first "Ma'am" and how it made me feel old.  She said "I'm not even 17!"  I know.  I know.  My first Ma'am was about then, too.  Young folks always get excited when they hear I'm an English teacher, like I'm going to magically impart wisdom to them just by being in the room.  But girls more than boys-- maybe cause girls are generally better at writing than boys of that age, and it's something they can sorta do.     So more details-- last night we drove up here using back roads, cause it shaves almost an hour off of the travel time, even when you don't count not having to go through Austin rush hour traffic (which usually adds at least an hour to the trip, so that means at least 2 hours saved).  It was a pretty drive-- rolling Texas ranches and trees and green green grass.  Small towns with those old circa 1940 brick buildings, a really yummy burger joint in Palestine Texas called Chips that had FRITO PIE (although I truly regretted the onions later).  There was this one ranch along the highway that was HUUUUUGGGE.  There must have been thousands of cows ranging about as far back as you could see.  It was actually really kinda cool.  Strangely enough, I saw at least four watermelons lying on the side of the road as we went by-- not in the same spot, mind you.  Miles apart.  Also not completely kersplat, like you would think they would be if they fell off a truck somewhere.  Just lying there, looking dejected.  But not like they grew there-- like they were left there by a little watermelon toting Hansel & Gretel.  I don't quite get it.  (Yay!  Prince just came on my playlist!! "When Doves Cry")    Okay, so that's totally enough random chatter. I need to go get some cat food for Tituba (who came with us, by the way, and wasn't too thrilled with the car ride).  And some groceries for our little tiny fridge in our hotel.  And, ummm, get some work done, too. (Oh, that!  Whatever!)    See ya tomorrow!   *Actually, it's Bossier City, Moxie Java, which is on Airline drive over by the Old Navy/Books A Million.   Here's a little shout out for those looking for something like the place!

      Driving home from the gym, about halfway there, I noticed a tiny little spider clinging desperately, crouched down low to hug the window better.  I don't know how she managed to hang on that long, cause I had been driving what, to a spider, must be like Mach 5.  (Spiders are always shes to me.  It's my story dammit).    So I felt bad and didn't want to see her go hurling out into the vortex of space like the alien queen in   urlLink Alien   after Ripley hits the "clear" button in the holding dock*.  So I slowed my car down to about 20 mph.  There was no one behind me to annoy with this slow slow irritating driving.  And the reduced speed allowed cute little spider to scurry into the safer corner by the wing mirror and enter into a crack into what was undoubtedly her stomping grounds under the door or somewhere.    I used to HATE spiders.  Because of a "my-oldest-sister-used-to-chase-screaming-infant/toddler-me-around-with spiders" childhood trauma.  But over the years, I've come to accept and even like their carnivorous spidey ways.  They eat bugs I really don't like-- like mosquitoes.  And they hardly ever really want to bite humans.  They tend to get swatted that way.  Now, all bets are off if you're a Black Widow or another really deadly spidey.  But cute little house/car spideys get a free ride.    Anyhoo.  That's the story of how I drove 15 miles under the speed limit to save the life of a car spidey who will probably jump out on me later today during the road trip,** sending me off into a ditch and causing me to spill my Starbucks all over my lap.  But that's okay.  As long as she got to live a long, happy spidey life.  :)  *and speaking of  Alien , there's a new "  urlLink Alien  " acted in 30 seconds with BUNNIES at angryalien.com.  Check it out.    *and yes.  I am going on a road trip to Shreveport, where we will be for TEN DAYS!! (God help me).  But I do now have a reliable wireless laptop and know of a wireless internet cafe where I will post at least every other day (during the week, especially).  So never fear.

      I've seriously tried to cut back on blog quizzes-- they can really be boring & hog up lots of time & energy.  But when I saw this one, I though it was fun.  And then who did I turn out to be!!  :)  Yay!  When you get your results, they have text which isn't included in your description below.  I love it!  They said:   Eleanor Roosevelt!  Nice to see you.  A Roosevelt yourself, you married your fifth cousin Franklin; despite the obvious incestuous overtones, your six kids were happy and healthy.  When Franklin got elected, you became perhaps the most controversial first lady ever - you spoke out for the rights of women; for the rights of the poor; for world peace. You were even a member of a union while your husband was in office - and when he died, you were the head of the UN Commission on Human Rights.  All of which is pretty kick ass, but to top things off you had a hot and steamy relationship with the lesbian journalist Lorena Hickok, who was so madly in love with you that she halted her career for you. Unfortunately, you couldn't give up your public life that easily - leaving her heartbroken.

      I haven't seen the new remake of  urlLink the Stepford Wives  yet.  I want to; I've been "saving" it to see with a friend of mine.  I did see the original, long ago.    I've been a feminist probably as long as I've been a female.  I've never questioned the idea that I have the right (not mere privilege) to have my own career, my own opinions, my own life.  I married a man who agrees with me, and in fact, is almost more driven than I am in pursuing my career.  I believe that my children, when I am ready to have them, will be enriched and strengthened by my independence and strength.  If, for some reason of fate and destiny, I am unable to have my own biological children because I have waited a little longer than some women then I will adopt-- or go without.  It probably goes without saying that I don't believe we have a biological imperative to reproduce-- I want children, very much, but am NOT willing to sacrifice my own life and my own happiness to have them.    "So what's your point?" you may be asking.  "This is all obvious, and we figured this stuff out a long time ago about you."    About a week ago, one of my "relatives by marriage"-- a young man, not the typical old guy who pesters me every time I see him-- lectured me on the problem with "you career women."  This lecture came suddenly, in the middle of another conversation, and I really had a hard time with the rudeness and ridiculousness of finding myself having the discussion. At first I thought he was joking; when I realized he was serious, I felt sick to my stomach.     Why he felt, based on a casual family relationship with me, that he had the right to lecture me when my husband and I have BOTH made the choices we made is infuriating.  (I have had maybe one other serious conversation with the guy in the years I've known him so it's not like this was something that had precedent).  I did want to tell him to get stuffed, but for family peace, held my tongue.  But he felt that it was perfectly alright to butt into my personal business and literally lecture me.  He eventually said "Oh, it's just my opinion" but also said things like "That's the trouble with YOU".  This was not a rhetorical discussion, and I did not invite his opinions, nor did I feel comfortable debating it with him.    Can you believe that there are still people who believe that merely because of their maleness they have a right to tell others what is right for their lives?  And without any knowledge of my situation would feel justified in lecturing me?  It makes the Stepford Wives feel much less like a science fiction speculation and much  MUCH  more scary.      *an interesting editorial about this is available at  urlLink Women's E-News

      Even when you have no real idea why you love them.....    urlLink Defending Your Life  .    Okay, I do have a list of these on the web here, but I just added the last one because I just watched it again.  It's really a stupid movie in a lot of ways...and I must have seen it about ten-twenty times.  (I'm not kidding.  It comes on HBO all the time and I watch it every single time I catch it).  I'm not saying I've watched it from start to finish each time-- this time I just caught the last twenty minutes or so.  But I'm sitting here with wet eyelashes cause the last scene makes me tear up-- it's so cool.   I am not really recommending this if you're cynical.  Or if you don't, sort of, at least half believe in soul mates & maybe even past lives.  But it's a funny movie, and Albert Brooks is such an unlikely romantic lead.  Meryl Streep plays the brave unapologetic woman in the female lead so well.  I want to be more like her character in real life-- not afraid to enjoy the pasta that comes my way, to be brave enough to save my children's (and my cat's) lives, and to be funny & happy.    OOh.  And now they're about to put   urlLink Planes, Trains, and Automobiles   on, too.  Another one I would watch a billion times.  I love Steve Martin's portrayals of the "stiff necked" yuppie.  He does it with such grace, and that look like his underware is pinching someplace tender when he's uncomfortable.  :)    What movies do you feel that way about?

      Okay, so I'm not going to write much today, except to say I'm trying REALLY hard to get some work done on the Buffy chapter of the dissertation.  I've dawdled and had fun for a couple of weeks now, and barely gotten anything done.  But I've been doing pretty well this morning; I'm reorganizing the chapter cause it's currently all over the place.  I think I may have it better right now, but I have to go print it and look.  Really, why is it so much harder to write this damn paper than it has been to write anything else I've written in the past?  I've come close to papers that are as long as the chapters I'm writing many, many times, and the Master's thesis was easy in comparison.  Maybe once I hit thirty my brain decided to quit on serious "academic" crap.  Sigh.    Off to the printer!

      A few years ago we redid the floors in our house from carpet to this lovely wood formica that looks like old weathered barn planks.  When the carpet was being torn up, our entire house was in an uproar-- all the furniture in every room had to be moved to another room, basically.  In the process, the furniture in the guest bedroom, which was where my story's "feature" was stored on the abundant bookshelves, had an "accident."    I didn't find out what happened until after the fact-- I came in and found them broken, and my flooring contractor never mentioned it to me.      So.  This is the topper from my wedding cake.  You see that the groom is wearing what looks like a military uniform-- it took quite a lot to fix it from the way it looked (more like a milkman before).  The bride has red hair (like me) and her dress is cut sort of like  urlLink mine was .  I also loved the way it was sort of retro looking-- very 1950s.  I loved this cake topper-- it was very me.  I had the topper inside a protector plastic thing for a while.  But when we moved to Texas, the protector thing got broken.  I also really liked having the topper on one of the bookshelves, just sitting there, like book shelf curios do.  And normally, people who wouldn't be careful with my things do not go traipsing about the guest bedroom, so I figured it was safe.    I came into the bedroom after the reconstruction of the house and found my bride & groom lying on a shelf, but her head was gone.  Snapped right off at the neck.  I looked and looked and did not find her head anywhere.  It seemed like a terrible omen.  I saved them for a long time; they sat on the bookshelf, the groom and headless bride, sort of like a creepy Adams family thing.      Well, somehow, this morning, my sister FOUND the bride's head. It was stuffed into this tote bag that one of my barbies had on her arm.  The barbie had fallen over, and when Judy went to "right" her, the head rolled out of the tote bag.  Sort of creepy, I know.  Funny, too, though.  So Judy glued her head on, and here she is, only a little worse for the wear. I'm planning to "touch up" her neck with some paint, but she doesn't look too bad!  The funniest part, though, is where the heck the head was all those years!!  And how it got into the Barbie's tote bag-- which is a new addition, and was not even in the house when the initial head disappearance happened.  I suspect that someone (probably one of the little kids who sometimes visit) found the bride's head in some little nook or cranny, and didn't really know what to do with it.  And that's exactly the sort of thing little kids get in trouble for, so I don't blame whoever for not pointing it out.    But I am very happy to have my little bride's head back on her neck.  They are now perched on a high shelf in my office, and will stay there.  So maybe that can be seen as some sort of positive omen, now, too.  My brain already feels less fuzzy today and perhaps the later plan of writing lots of dissertation will actually come true.    After all-- it is nice to get a little head now and then. (Drum roll please.)

      I kind of like  urlLink grackles .  A lot of people consider them pests, and really hate them, because they swarm in big flocks and poop on cars and in pools and generally  make irritating yard guests by chasing off "cuter" birds and stealing all the food.  (In this sort of behavior, grackles remind me of some people I know).  They are considered by some to be a " urlLink pest bird " because of their lack of tidy behavior.    But I think when you watch a grackle stalking bugs or just stomping around a parking lot or park that you really can believe that birds are the  urlLink modern descendents of dinosaurs .  They look so feral, so ruthless.  If they were big enough, they would have no qualms about eating us.  Their birdcall is sort of like a cross between a buzz and a whistle, and they have these shiny brown/blue/black feathers and beady little black eyes.    Today, I mowed our lawn.  As you mow the lawn, bugs, grasshoppers, spiders, etc-- any bug that was using the long rain soaked grass as a refuge-- will run for it.  As the bugs try to escape the blades of fury, they apparently become quite vulnerable in their panic to smart birds who have figured out a lawnmower means a quick easy meal.  There were, by the time I finished mowing the back yard, at least five grackles stalking around the spaces I had just passed with the lawnmower.  They looked like they were getting a good feast, too.  Now, I do feel empathy for the bugs that became dinner.  But eventually everyone ends up someone's dinner, so it's part of the deal.  And I had to admire the cleverness of those little brown beady-eyed dinosaurs with feathers in figuring out that the lawnmower is essentially like the pizza delivery guy just rang their doorbell.  Now if I could just get them to give me a 15% tip.  (And I'm sure that grackles have swiped plenty of valuables in their time and could manage more than 15% bug as a tip).

      We've got two parties to go to today, plus the fireworks celebrations at Randolph later.  A cool band,  urlLink Two Tons of Steel , is playing on base.  I hope we all make it there from second party at Jim's house.  It's a little bit of a drive, though, so I'm not quite holding my breath.    Andrew, Judy, Nissa, Aaron & I all have matching flag Old Navy t-shirts.  We're going to be so cute someone will definitely want to hurt us.  :)   I hope everyone has a wonderful day, filled with junk food, cool summer beverages, and friends & family.  (And beverages.  Those are very important!)

           I just got this wonderful little book-- my favorite is "Hedda Lettuce".  The drag dolls are based on real drag queens.  I got it for two reasons-- one, as I've mentioned before, I am a "drag queen trapped in a woman's body."  The other is that I am really interested in gender as performance, drag, etc.    If you read my  urlLink drag queen guide  on Amazon, you'll see what I mean a little.  But it's mostly that when I was a little kid, for a brief time, my mom & I lived in the back living quarters in a gay bar--and there were definitely some drag queens there.  And I love love love dressing up in fancy shmancy glam clothes.   And this book is a little gem.  It's soooo cool.  :)

      We just watched " urlLink The Station Agent "-- it's a quirky contemplative movie.  I recommend it to anyone who likes movies about friendship in odd places.    We had friends over, and everyone (even the usual "fall asleep during movies" crowd) enjoyed it.  So... rush right on out.  :)  So what are ya'll doin' for fourth of July?  We're going to Canyon Lake tomorrow, then to a friend's house for a party on Sunday.  I think we'll make it to fireworks... we'll see.

      Andrew & I are sometimes disgustingly cute.  Remember that  Seinfeld  episode where they were annoyingly sweet, declaring     "No, you're shmoopy"... well, we're often like that.  One of the things we do is say how much we love each other.  And compete with it-- as in "Oh yeah, well I love YOU more."  "Well I love you infinity" "Oh yeah?  Well I love you infinity plus one".  (I know.  It's pukey).  :)    So as I mentioned while in Alaska, I found a mammoth bone necklace that was called a "triple infinity" but which I call "infinity plus one".  Here is a small picture of it, and if you click on it, you'll get a much larger view.  It's cool, huh?  I like it lots. The infinity loop is if you turn it on its side.

      A good friend of mine is having a medical issue right now that really makes me angry that people have to go through.  There's no one to really be mad at, except of course, the universe.  I told her that I wish there was someone whose ass I could kick because of it.  I mean it, too.  This is the time when you feel that impotent rage at the injustice of such a situation that just is so powerful.  This person is a kind, giving, wonderful woman, and I know the situation is really really hard.  And I wish I could do  something .     I wish I could say more; I'd really like to rant about this for a while.  It is one of those places where blogs conflict with privacy-- I feel an urge to write about this but maybe I need to do it somewhere else, where only I see those thoughts.  But at the same time, there's something cathartic to sharing with strangers.  So just know that I am morally outraged at the universe today, and if I could, I would pop someone in the eye for what is happening here.  (I know, violence is wrong.... but it feels like the best response to this situation).

      Remember that silly poem: " Make new friends and keep the old, one is silver, the other gold?" Also, remember my thing about classmates.com the  urlLink other day  (not like it's so long ago, but still.) Well, because on classmates I found one of my old friend's married names, and googled that, and found an email address, I've now had an email from her! She was the first person who was nice to me back when I moved to Florida in 9th grade, partly cause she was new in town too, but also cause she was just cool. She was really into Duran Duran,* and every time I hear a song by them I have thought of her in the last 15 years since high school graduation. But we both went different directions (I think she moved to California right after high school...I'll get more details after her second email!) Anyway. I just wrote her a long gushy email, and maybe she'll even stop in to say hello on the blog, since I of course included that info in my email. It's neat to connect with people who meant something to you "back then." Most of the names on classmates were just vague recollections of people I sort of remember. But a few are people who you shared moments with, and that is the point of high school reunions-- reconnecting with folks you want to hear about.  So yes, we're in Louisiana right now. Andrew is off flying around doing airplane stuff and I'm here planning work on THE CHAPTER. (I'll start calling it that; sounds ominous, doesn't it?!) I've already done a tiny bit of editing but I slept really late this morning. Hotel rooms tend to do that to me, I turn into a sleep-deprived zombie and can't wake up till the maids start pounding on the door saying "you want soap? Toilet paper? Let us in let us in!!! Things are mildewing in there!!"  Okay. So maybe I need to get some work done. And so do you. So let's be good together. :)  *she was a John Taylor fan; I myself prefereed the nerdier Simon LeBon.  Besides, it's not cool to bogart your friend's crush so you have to choose a different band guy to lust after.  :)

      So today I just finished teaching my SECOND step aerobics class. I had better music and a "plan" to change the routine a little bit. It went much better today. I didn't turn beet red, which I did on Wednesday for some unknown aerobically mysterious reason. The class sweated; I think they were all pretty happy. A few said "this music today is MUCH better". And it made me realize something....  If you do the job badly the first time, then improve on the second, you only seem loads better in the eyes of your audience. My master plan of aerobics domination is working. Mwah ha ha ha.  Speaking of music, if you work out at the gym and want cool music to put in your headphones, besides the lame stuff you can get through bookstores, check out the following website. You don't have to be a fitness professional to order this stuff. The "Step" aerobics CDs would be good for ellipticals, and stair machines. And probably jogging, although I don't do that so often:  urlLink http://www.powermusic.com/  I don't get any commission or anything but it is amazing how difficult it was for me to find this cool aerobics music source. And I really looked! The good thing about this pro mixer is that they eliminate extra beats, keep the beats consistent so you keep the same heart rate going, and they must kick in the drums more cause you can really hear them. So. My endorsement for the day.  Finally-- road trip! I call shotgun!!!! We're headed to Shreveport till Sunday night. But I'll go to the internet cafe, so you won't have to miss me much. :)

      Have you ever noticed that when someone "thanks you for your patience" that most of the time you're not feeling patient at all? You're waiting on hold. Something you wanted is unavailable. You're actually ready to rip someone's ears off and pin them to your cork bulletin board?  Yeah. Me too.

        Read over your compositions, and wherever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine, strike it out .-- Samuel Johnson  Urk. Lots of work.  (Hey that rhymes.) I eliminated FIVE WHOLE pages of my dissertation today. In my office garbage can there is now an entire former tree branch* of balled up paper with scribbles (in red ink, no less) upon which I was trying WAAAAAAY too hard to do something my advisor doesn't want me to do anyway (literally compare/ urlLink conflate  feminists and witches). I also took out a nasty section I wrote last week (sad, but true) about web-misogynists who call ALL feminists evil bitch feminazis who should be killed. I did the research, had a point, but then realized it really is not that related to my point in the dissertation-- beside the point. And at this point I need to just GET ON WITH IT! (Yes, if you're counting, I have used the word point FOUR (4) times in those last sentences). You want originality and word variety-- wait for the dissertation to be done and published. For now, the thesaurus is closed.  William Faulkner supposedly told young writers that to be a good writer you have to "kill your darlings." Or get rid of those things you love, but are working too too hard to save. So I killed 2,500 words worth of darlings today. Yay me! It sort of defeats the purpose of the "dissertation counter" though, which was steadily moving up, but now is way, way down. Hey. It's not quantity it's quality. Size of the ship, motion of the ocean and all that.  *yes, I try to conserve paper. But it gets difficult when you go through reams at a time and the whole point is to write the damn thing, not to worry about deforestation. I'll plant a tree when I'm done with the PhD, okay?!

      Yes, I've been feeling nostalgic lately, as some of my posts have shown. I keep getting those damn pop up ads from "classmates.com" and I went there this fine morning for a few minutes. I've been there before-- back six-ish years ago when my 10 year high school reunion was, I was drinking margaritas and added a ton of info about myself, including a photo. I think I'm the only one in my entire high school class who put a photo up. Sigh. I've talked to two people from the website; one I contacted because of the info on the site, one found me cause she learned my name (it's different from when I was in high school, duh!) and then found my many many websites. I liked chatting briefly with those two!  One of them was amazed I remembered her-- she did disappear in 9th grade, but I thought she was cool then. She still lives in the place we grew up, and I would go see her if I ever stopped by. I still have her email address in my address book, and maybe one day.... (JEEZ! In trying to write this this morning, I've had every single other being in my house interrupt me. The husband (with some very fun for me & you garage cleaning activities) the cat (the usual) and a quick comment/question from the sister.) It's only taking me longer to get through this, you know!  So while reading my daily  urlLink Get Fuzzy,  I got a pop up for classmates this morning (which we all usually ignore) and went to look. A couple of people who weren't at the 10 year, and one who I actually wanted to see, had added their listings. I found an email address for one and wrote to her. She's one who is listed on my blog of 100 things about me. I'll have to update that list with her new name; maybe she'll find me by googling herself. One other person from another period of my life who is on the 100 things found me through that list (although I haven't heard back from her after the initial email.)  Maybe I come across as desperate because I have those pictures of me on the classmates page. Not desperate-- but smashed drunk at the time and currently unwilling to admit that it's kind of silly. Also, I look damn good. :) And I did update the photo of the "now" this morning. Cause I'm a doofus. But clearly, I have no real issues with sharing personal info with complete strangers on the Internet. Is that so wrong? It's not like you people can find me and torture me with vacation pictures or something (and if you try, I do have weapons to fight you off with. Seriously). :)  I'm really not at all that worried about keeping in touch with people who I didn't keep in touch with initially from high school. It's just kind of interesting to see where certain folks ended up, and I kind of am curious. I care about a few people from high school, and at least one of them reads this blog regularly. (Hi J!) So it's not a big deal to look at the classmates website and look at names from 16 years ago. (I know. It's a long time!)  But a few names make me nauseous, still. The ones that would do that the worst weren't there. That doesn't mean I don't occasionally google those names on the Internet. They won't find me that way-- they have to know my new "secret identity" as a married woman. But it's still weird to catch yourself caring in the least bit, cause I don't. I think it's more that I'm hoping to find a police report: "Evil Ex boyfriend was arrested yesterday after being stopped and found to be the 'XYZ serial killer; death penalty advocates and the Pope say "hang him up by his curlies'"..... you know. That sort of thing. Something that would make you smile.

      Do you take aerobics classes? I have for like, years and years. A good aerobics class makes you sweaty, healthily tired, and feel good about the fact that you got your cardio-vascular workout of the day done and for the rest of the day you're burning more calories than you would on a day where you don't workout.  As I've said here before, I'm currently learning to be an aerobics teacher. It's hard! I never appreciated aerobics instructors as much until now. I've now taught one hi-lo class, and today, my first step class. It went okay-- I had ISSUES with music again this time. I'm working on it. I ordered some stuff from a DJ in Nuevo Yorkay. :) I am counting on him to make me cool and have the right BPM (beats per minute) and cool contemporary stuff that doesn't like "Mickey Mouse sings Beyonce." (Which is entirely possible.)  But man. Working out and talking through the entire class makes you so tired and sweaty and I have a workout headache now. I think I need a nap.  Oh. But "I Love the 90s" is doing 1993! That's the year I got married. I might have to lie here on the couch with no brain activity for a while.

      Ugh. I hate getting up this early. Human beings should be cosily in bed, curled up with a feather pillow and cool sheets with a 300 thread count at this time of the day. Everything should start later. I, Kim, Goddess of the Universe, declare it so.   So mote it be  .  There. That's better. Now go back to bed (but make sure you still get to work/school on time).  The husband is all excited about his new bar. He woke up at 5:30 this morning, turned on the hall light causing me to not be able to sleep comfy like, and went to putter around in the kitchen. I am teaching my first step class this AM at 9, so I needed to get up and think about what I was going to teach anyway. Bleah! Mornings suck. I much prefer to get up at around 8:30. Much more civilized. I realize there are some dementedly happy people who enjoy getting up at the crack of dawn. I think perhaps if that is you then you might consider some healthy therapy. Come to my place to spend the night, I'll show you how much nicer it is to sleep till all the traffic is gone from the roads, and there are fresh cranberry raspberry orange scones to be had, dripping with a little real butter. Screw that whole "worm" crap.

      Our cool "cocktail/coffee" bar is being finished right now, as I write. It's been "in the works" ever since I was sewing costumes on the glass table we used to have and the table broke. (ummm. About 1 .5 years ago!) But the actual construction has been the last month. Today the countertop guy is in there installing the top part. It's an "L" shaped bar with white base, a cool slate colored bar for the top and a "brushed steel" look on the counter.  But there's drill noise, and banging, and hammering, and the smelly smelly glue adhesive they use to put the Laminate on the wood. And the menfolks just checked the countertop guy's adherence to their "plan"/blueprints and found a major error, and so it has to be redone.  Will it be worth it? Yes. Just wait till the hoity toity martini party.

      I meet him in a  bar . It is May, Wednesday night and I am out with my sister and we had been to ladies' night at a bar called Chan's and moved from there where there were too many women to Shanahan's, a dance bar downtown. The air is hot and musty and smells of the Bay. It sticks to your skin as you walk from the car to the line where they are checking IDs. The bald bouncer lets us in with a lewd comment. When we first get past the crush of people at the bar, I have to  get rid  of the three or four vodka and cranberries I had at Chan's, so I bounce away from a work friend & the sis who stand and chat near the dance floor, while I brave the line to the ladies' room. Ladies standing fourdeep in front of the mirror, re-lipsticking, spraying Aussie Scrunch Spray and cursing at each other about some guy. Three stalls. Too long a wait but finally, I burst back into the darkness of the bar, ready to go.  When I come back, there is a song on that I   have   to dance to. Drums, bass, pounding, wiggle-worthy music. I will not remember the name of the song. It might be "Shake Shake It" cause I love that one. I race to the dance floor and grab the hand (brazen hussy) of the guy standing just on the edge of the floor looking like he might want to. He says (now) that he is thinking about either asking my sister, who he spotted first, to dance or going to get another beer. I give him no choice. He says: " I thought you'd never ask ." Suave. Funny thing--my sister wouldn't have danced-- she needs a long time to get ready to dance with someone and we had just gotten there. She dances later that night with the guy in the Miller Lite beer delivery man shirt, with a Tom-Selleck-y mustache; we never see him again.  Fate.   We dance all night. I tell him who  he  is.... military guy, in training at NAS Pensacola, I tell him he wears one of those ugly watches all military guys wear, has a "girlfriend back home" (cause no matter what they tell you ladies, they always do). He laughs, caught, guilty. (They are sorta broken up, but still, she has a hold on him). I tell him who I am-- well. Sort of. I fib a bit. I'm not YET in college and I say I am a sophomore English major. How do I know my one white lie ends up being caught by this guy I meet in a bar? I mean, who marries the guy they meet in a bar? His buddy Ron (Call sign  Stink  cause he is a charming, gorgeous brown-noser who will fly fighter jets like Tom Cruise in  Top Gun  and he knows it but he's way too short for me) comes up and flirts with  us both . I kiss them both on the cheek, chaste but promising.  We leave the dance floor to sit at the bar, he buys me a couple of drinks, we talk. I keep asking him if there's lipstick on my teeth or something, cause he keeps looking at me with this look in his eye. He thinks I'm a little bit nuts already. He also thinks he might just score. I tell him I am going to be like the teacher in  urlLink  Back to School .  You know. The one who erotically recites the end of the  urlLink Penelope  speech from  Ulysses  in front of her Brit Lit class and makes Rodney Dangerfield, well, excited about literature?   shall I wear a red yes and how he kissed me under the Moorish wall and I thought well as well him as another and then I asked him with my eyes to ask again yes and then he asked me would I yes to say yes my mountain flower and first I put my arms around him yes and drew him down to me so he could feel my breasts all perfume yes and his heart was going like mad and yes I said yes I will Yes.   I am wearing thin hot pink silk-- shorts and a matching top. My hair is very red and long and curly in a spiral perm that takes three hours to set and roll at the salon (the stylist always amazed at how much hair I have). People say I look like Julia Roberts, but I don't, just my hair does. I write my name and number on a square cocktail napkin. He saves the napkin and puts it into a scrap book. I write my name, "the girl in the pink outfit, not from K-Mart." As he walks me to my sister's ugly baby blue and primer colored car, he gives me a sweet kiss.  We date for a while. I have really just broken up with the  evil -ex-- about two weeks, officially, even though we were really splits for a long time. I figure this guy, this guy with a girlfriend back home, is just for fun. He's a rebound guy. We have great times together. I don't snoop around his apartment while he's in the shower (much). He lives right on the white sandy beach and as I try to throw him playfully into the water he trips me and tosses me in. He is already too competitive to let me win at this wrestling match.  One night, at a toga party as he is wearing a Popples toga, with banana boxer shorts and red-brown cowboy boots, at Trader John's, he quirks his head sideways, drunk, looks at me with a squinty face and says "Love me?" He is tricky, this one.  He gets me to say it first . I try to drive his crazy, steering-column shifter truck home later because he has had too much to drink. As I try to remove the parking break, I pop the hood of the rust-red colored dented Ford that smells of clean but decidedly masculine male.  It takes us two years to urlLink  get married . It is two years and four days after we first met. About two blocks from the bar, in the  urlLink oldest house in Pensacola .   yes [13] years ago my God after that long kiss I near lost my breath yes he said was a flower of the mountain yes so we are flowers all

      Okay okay. Enough already. This'll be the last installment on the Kim's Quest for Pixelly Greatness (unless someone else makes me one, and then I'll have to post it!)   But here is the     fabulous     pixel Kim that  urlLink Liz  made for me.  I love it love it love it. How did you know that I am constantly making that "see how big my biceps are?" gesture? Am I making it in another picture? It's always possible. But I adore this. I will most likely put it in my sidebar somewhere. Hee Hee.

      When I was a little girl, for a summer, I got to go with my mother who was a shrimper out of Mississippi on several fishing trips. One of those trips is a memory that means a lot to me, and I've tried to capture it in writing before and failed miserably. I hope to get it right eventually. It's not really a "happy" memory, but not a sad or tragic one either. But I guess it's the closest I came as a kid to a vacation of sorts. I always think of this period when I am on a boat, especially headed out to sea when you can still see the port behind you and you're not yet far enough to see the bending curve of ocean on each horizon.  We began by loading up with groceries. What I remember best were the crackers and Cheese Whiz. I'm sure there were other foods; if you're out at sea for an entire week, you need a fair amount of food to eat. But all I really remember is the Cheese Whiz. I can still taste the salty not-cheese flavor of that too-orange spread on saltine crackers, and still see the captain of the boat, a grizzled, scruffy-bearded man who smelled like fish and the vinegary combination of sweat and stale beer, who looked a lot like Abraham Lincoln, spreading the cheese methodically on his cracker. When he wasn't eating crackers, he liked to examine the contents of his nose in a long, gooey line spread between thumb and forefinger . He also had a bum leg, and a metal pin in one leg that made him limp terribly. He was not a very nice man, and scarecrow thin. He was my mother's boyfriend, and the man responsible later for our moving to Louisiana. (A totally different story). But I remember that he seemed to begrudge me the food I ate, as though having me on board made the burden of being out at sea that much more difficult, like I ate more than anyone else onboard and didn't contribute anything that made my keep earned.  As we left the port, with waves breaking fast and hard against the front of the boat, salt spray whipping into my face and landing on lips, eyes, and hair, dolphins raced with us, starting with three or four, and up to the eight I counted eventually. Their sleekly wet, glistening grey bodies arched through the air and they stayed ahead of us, and you could almost hear them laughing as their mouths turned up in that perpetual dolphin smile. We must have been going pretty fast, and you could hear the engine pounding, sounding like one of those older rides at the carnival, one you wouldn't really want to ride because it seemed unsafe but your friends would dare you to get on anyway, and you'd ride, holding tightly to the seat restraint for dear life. Even with our speed, though, the dolphins would stay right in front of us for a delightfully long time.  At night, the boat would jolt and sway us to sleep, and I remember the sound of the engine, which was a loud, diesel vibration deep beneath the area where the sleeping bunks were. The beds were made of that yellow foam, about six inches thick, foam which was dusty and slightly mildewed-- the sheetless bunk was a long rectangle tucked into a wooden platform that you reached with a ladder, and you also had for comfort a thin, sweaty-smelling pillow, and a light blanket that used to be white but was gray with use. The entire inner cabin smelled of old fish and smokey fuel, and cheap, spilled beer. If you craned your neck, you could see into the front of the captain's room, where the instruments glowed blue and orange and the radio crackled unintelligibly about coming storms and people from other boats cursed and laughed.  During the day, the boat would lower its big wooden doors, the mechanism that regulates the shrimp nets, and after they had been dragged behind us for a long time, they would be pulled up, heavy with a rounded dripping mass of fish and blue crabs and grey slimy shrimp and blackly-blue stingrays and eels. The nets would open and dump the catch on the deck. The shrimpers would then "pick out" the good shrimp, the fish that they wanted to keep, and anything else would be thrown over the side. Crabs would scurry sideways towards the little holes in the side of the boat, escaping to the ocean. Those that couldn't make it would balefully glare at you with their eyes on long stalks, threatening with one large claw, and they would pinch you if you reached stupidly for them. One kind of fish had what seemed like human looking teeth, and big, wide eyes with a black center, and it would gasp hopelessly lying on its side and send shivers down my back.  I sat on top of the wooden stage-like opening to the boat's "cooler"-- a cold storage room in the ship's center filled with ice inside the ship where the catch would be placed later. I reached down, grabbing long shrimp whiskers and placed "my" catch into a bucket. I was proud of my catch because I only grabbed the longest whiskers, and so my shrimp were all large and my bucket filled quickly. But I was very slow, compared to the adults, and considered a nuisance and usually had to wait inside the cabin because I got in the way.  There was even a storm that spawned water spouts, and I remember lying in my bunk as I heard the rest of the crew yell over the wind. During the storm, lightning hit the boat, shorting out the radio and streaming along the lines above us. The next night, after the "pick out" was over, several sharks began to follow the boat, greedily scooping up the castaway bits of the last catch. The captain tried to scare them off, but they kept coming back. They finally got into the nets the captain had cautiously lowered, thinking them gone, tearing the rope nets so badly that the captain had to decide to quit the trip. I remember the captain taking his pistol and shooting one of the sharks in the head, and the other sharks turning on their now dead partner. But the damage had been done, and we had to turn back because the repairs could not be done while under way. In his frustration, the captain did not notice a sandbar and ran up on it, breaking the propeller shaft. Because the radio was still out, we couldn't call for help and were stranded over night, and late into the next day until, with their bathing suits on, my mother and sister (who was with us on this trip) waved another boat down. We were then towed into Louisiana, where the boat got its repairs and we eventually headed back home. It was probably the worst trip, and plagued with bad luck after bad luck.  After all the bad luck, headed back into the harbor as the sun began to turn the clouds over the horizon gold and pink and purple, and the water that indigo-grey color like well-washed denim, I remember sitting in front of the boat again, same salty water in my hair, and eyes, and on my lips. And dolphins racing before us as we neared the shoreline.

      Can you tell that   It's Sunday and I have nothing else to do  Andrew is working  My sister went to the tanning salon  I don't feel like exercising or doing anything remotely productive  There's nothing good on TV?    I wrote this post before and then my darn computer crashed. It happens oh so less frequently than my old computer used to (the one that is dead, with a bunch of files trapped in limbo until some gentle, wise computer-literate person will help me get them off the old hard drive). But it's annoying, nevertheless.  What I did just now was post a new little " urlLink photoessay " with a few photos (highlights you might say) of my recent trip to Alaska, along with a few other pictures. There's commentary.  If you want to see more Alaska pictures, get yourself an ofoto account and  urlLink go here . It's free, for heaven's sake, and they don't send you any spam, I promise. I am entirely too lazy to upload any other pictures. Procrastination rules here. And I am but its simple servant.

      Okay, I'm totally always talking about this here.  (And can you tell, by the way, that I grew up in the 80s with Valley Girl speak being cool? I mean, fur shure!)  But I thought some of you might be interested in reading the first few paragraphs of my dissertation. It'll tell you approximately what I'm writing about, and it'll show how cool I am.  (I hope.)  Plus, I can prove that I actually AM writing at least a little bit.  So here goes:  Introduction   	The mythical witch is particularly bound to the female gender, and it is perhaps even an archetype, and in understanding how society deals with and understands witches, we can understand much about how society deals with and understands women.  There are certain characteristics that are easily identifiable surrounding the idea of the witch, and it is these characteristics that certain popular texts re-write and challenge, revising  expectations about what is normal about femininity and what is othered.  Some of the myths around witches persist into stereotypes because there are elements of truth in them, elements which continue to teach us about ourselves, especially in the questioning of these norms by the writers in the texts discussed in this dissertation. Magical Feminist writers take part in the project that science-fiction writer and feminist Marge Piercy describes as one in which women writers: 	 Must break through the old roles to encounter our own meanings in the symbols we experience in dreams, in songs, in vision, in meditation.  Some of these symbols are much older than capitalism, and some contain knowledge we must recover; but we receive all through a filter that has aligned the stuff by values not our own.  What we use we must remake.  Then only we are not playing with dead dreams but seeing ourselves more clearly, and more clearly becoming.  The defeated in history lose their names, their goddesses, their language, their culture.  The myths we imagine we are living (old westerns, true romances) shape our choices.  (Dear Frontiers, 63-64).   	Because the witch is automatically a woman with a different power than a normal woman, in examining how the image of the witch changes or even remains static, we can also examine stories society tells us about what it means to be a woman with and seeking power both personal and political.  The witch moves from hated devil to much-admired role model and back again, and the authors this dissertation studies do much to imagine the way the witch stands in for women.  In so-doing, they teach us how they define what being a woman seeking power (defined very basically as control over ones own destiny) today means.  The witch as metaphor may be fiction, but, as Ann Howey argues in her excellent dissertation,  Once and Future Women: Popular Fiction, Feminism and Four Arthurian Rewritings  (1997) :  fictional characters allow readers positions to occupy in imagination, and occupying those positions may lead the reader to question the differences (or disturbing similarities) between fictional and real social relations.  Fiction with female protagonists [i.e., the witch] gives readers both interesting positions to occupy in imagination and potentially new perspectives on society.  Some radical feminists argue that such perspectives are the basis for social change. (10)   There's a whole lot more. But no one else would want to see the rest for now.  It still needs work.  But fun, huh?

      I don't understand why the 18-30 crowd doesn't vote.  When I turned 18, voting for me was like a much better version of getting your driver's license.  You were grown up!  Responsible!  An adult!  I voted in my very first election (presidential) just weeks after I turned 18.  This was the Bush Sr. vs. Dukkakis election of 1988.  (I won't tell you who I voted for.  It's sort of embarrassing.  But you can guess since the poor guy was not invited to the inauguration party.)  :)    I'd been thinking about this because my husband, the newshound, cannot stand to not flip back and forth between the dozens of 24 hour news channels, and/or news interview shows, and/or talk radio, and/or NPR coverage.  I'm inundated.  I can barely manage to flip to VH1 for "I love the 80s" or "The Fabulous Life of Oprah Winfrey"-- you know, important programming that means something.    During my first wait in line to go pull the lever of the cool assed voting machine, I experienced an interesting event.  One of the candidates for local sheriff was a guy with the last name "Irish."  His campaign stuff was everywhere-- and it included a cute little shamrock pin made of sparklies.  Now, I can appreciate anyone who is into Irish stuff.  And as an official drag queen, I am ALL about sparklies and proper use of accessories.  I would say the candidate had me at "hello" for the most part.  I was planning on voting for him.  BUT.    (And you knew but was coming.)   As I was standing in line, this literal Fat Cat (in a vest for Goddess sake!!!) turned to me and said, in a paternalistic Southern Accent, "Vote for Shmuckatelly Irish". (Names have been changed to make me feel more important).  Okay, I don't know if you know this, but most places have a rule that you cannot campaign in a certain distance from the voting area.  It's often something like 500 feet.  So standing in line was a bit closer than 500 feet.  It was illegal for him to say this to me, not to mention rude, condescending, and offensive.  It was everything that I hate about old Southern men..  The assumption that I would not only need his advice, but welcome it.  Cause clearly a little 18 year old girlie standing in line to vote has not already made up her mind and needs the advice of a complete stranger with the bad taste to wear a GREEN vest in 1988.    Okay.  Sure.  Maybe I hadn't really really made up my mind until then.  I chose to vote for the other guy.  I can't even remember his name, but it was the "Not Shmuckatelly Irish" vote.  I was SOOOO offended, but I didn't say anything.  I was awfully young, and back then, dear reader, I was not as eloquent and bossy as I am now.  Nowadays, I would point out to said jerk-face that he was committing a crime in his campaign for SHERIFF and that if he didn't "step off" I was going to go get the old ladies from the League of Women Voters.  And you know, you don't want to piss those blue-haired voting Terminators off.  They'd be on him like white on rice.  And he would so deserve it.    But still.  Vote early, and vote often.  I don't care who the hell you vote for.  But do it.  Find out what the candidates stand for or don't stand for.  Use one of those  urlLink choosey things online .  And then be prepared to change your mind IF you get a last minute election irregularity standing in line with you.
