      Today is my first post. Of course it is.  Em, I thought this would be an interesting thing to start. Maybe it will help me thru some of my issues. Just not sure that I want anyone reading this at all. I've had a stressful few weeks. My daughter just started daycare. I am scared somewhat. I hate trusting people.  I've been pretty depressed. I keep realizing how alone I am. I just wish, I had someone to love me. Or at least a good friend to hang out with once in a while. All I do here is work, sleep, talk on the net and go to school. It's beginning to really suck. Well, it has sucked for a long time, I'm just realizing how bad it is. Least I don't have to deal with Wil much, cuz he started working.  I've had a lot of anger issues lately. Wish I didn't, wish I could control it. I want to get therapy or something, but I've very scared. Scared of change I guess. Scared that people will find out what goes on in my head. It's not a good thing most the time.  Just so many bad things happened to me, when I was young, and the people should of been punished, and they haven't. I guess that is just what I want. To give me closure. I don't want this guy to do things to his daughters now that he has some. I fear for things like these daily. Especially for my daughter.

      Ok, well the other day... I wrote a whole lot of touchy feely things here, and knowing my luck, the computer at work, messed up as i was trying to Post & Publish it. Oh well...   Well her I come to write again. I don't much to say, though. I am not doing so good. I'm not feeling well,and I'm getting nervous..and stuff about moving.  My car is still not fixed, I really haven't done anything. Big problem is money though. Not sure I have enough. And what happens if I have trouble getting an apartment. I keep dreading that. I am going to have to live in a shitty litte apartment.  And pay most of my money to daycare. My car will die, and I will be stuck again. I am so scared.  I just wish, that I had someone around to love and support me. I am beginning to hate my life here. I  do know, though, that things will get better.   I have yet to call most my family and tell them I'm moving. I guess that I should do that tommorrow.   Well I dont have anything else to say that would be productive, so I will shut up now.

      Em, It's been a while since I've wrote here... on my website.  WELL, with all the bad things that have happened to me lately, some good things are finally starting to come thru. I'm moving out of the apartment that I share with Wil. I can't handle living with him. He makes me want to be violent. That is NOT my good side.  I went on a date with Shane yesterday, it was same old.. same old.  He picked me up at Hobby Lobby, and I seriously thought we were going out.. going out..  But we went back to his.. house. The same house, he told me that he had moved out of.  Everything he said, didnt' make sense. Oh.. well he told.. me.. oh, he's been single since December, and that.. he didn't really date any girls, just hung out with them a while.  YEAH!! well that is what he does with me. I can just imagine how many other girls, he has over. He always, seems to want to demand, me to do something.  Then, after a while, I  think he gets sick of hearing me say no, and that is when.. he says..he has a meeting, or has to go to work. Oh well. I didnt' want to date him .. I just wanted to get someone else off my mind. It doesn't seem to be working.  All the nice guys, seem to be married(or dating) or gay.  I'm not sure I understand this.  It's crazy. Every guy I meet, is either, crazy, clingy.. or married. With the exception of one. Well, and maybe he is crazy. But I'm crazy too, so I guess that part doesn't matter. I guess it's the degree of craziness.   I can't believe I am finally moving out. I'm so nervous and scared. I hope things go alright. I have so many things to do this week. You should hear Wil, he's been so evil lately. I think he has a major mental problem.  Oh, well, soon enough.. not my problem. I just hope Darian does alright... I don't want to break her heart. I know this will hurt her. As long as Wil acts civil though, he can see her.   Well, I need to get off this.. thing, and write a letter to my brother, and a friend..and do some homework.  Wish anyone that reads this.. a great day.

      Well, today was uneventful. The best thing that really happened today, was I got to chat briefly with a friend that was out of town for a few days. I enjoy, his company(although brief) very much. I've had a rough weekend.. I guess you would call it that.   Thursday and Friday I had off. School was Thursday. I did ok on my test. My essay is going ok also. Friday I went to Wellington. Wil finally let me use his car. The drive down was nice. Very pleasant. Meeting my friend was great also. She's very very nice.   Saturday I had to work. That was fun also. I got to hang out talking to Michael most of the day. And also got to talk to Mickey for a little bit. I had not seen him all week.  Work is usually the highlight of my days.   Some strange things happened in the last few days. I'm not sure what to do about it. These things happened between me and Wil. I think he wants to get back together. I have no desire to do so. I want someone to truely love me. Someday I will find that. I think I will be breaking his heart. He's been telling me that he loves me for like three days. And I just shrug him off and say, Yes.. I know.   Well not sure what else to write. Today was my Grandmother's Birthday. I can't believe I didn't remember. I never remember important things.  With the exception of today, I have been much happier. I am trying not to dwell on what I can't have, and just work on what I do have.  I'm still losing weight.. this makes me so happy. I fit into the pants.. from my mom, that I didnt' fit into three years ago(almost) when she bought them. I have reached my first goal. I can't wait.. till I lose about 30 more pounds.. I will look sooo hot.  Oh, wait.. I already do..   Well I will end this here and now. I am going to get offline. I think Darian may have just went to sleep. :)

      Well not sure how my day went today. I guess that is was ok. Not that great. Not that bad.  Work was tiring, and boring at the same time. I had a guy yell at me, and say that he wanted to talk to someone else, so when I was transferring him, he hung up. Laughs, that is typical of men like that.    I still have not contacted that guy. The one that likes me so much, but I don't trust him. And so far, he has not called me either. That is a good thing. The other guy, the one I like so much, and doesn't like me. Well that is uneventful. As usual. I guess it's not a matter of him not liking me. I think there are other reasons for the way he acts. None of which I will mention, because they will make me seem paranoid. I think.  I have school, tommorrow. Oh NO.  Hopefully I will have time to work on my essay. Still don't know if I can get Friday off. I wish I could find out soon. I really want to take it off.   I'm still pissed. I found out today for sure, the temps are getting paid more than me. It sucks. Everyone agrees I should take it up to with my boss. I dunno... what to think. I hate .. I dunno. I know I deserve to make more money, but in the same breath..  I don't want to rattle anyones chains. Especially since this... was supposed to be a secret and not told to anyone.    I guess I will stop writing now, and get my butt to bed. I hope to have lovely dreams of possibly falling in love. I had some neat dreams last nite (or the nite before) of my wonderful flying acrobats. Those dreams are also fun.

      Another day, another dollar. I got upset on the way home from work, because the temps are getting paid as much as I am. I've put in almost a year with Viking. And I tell myself.. it's ok, Julie, you of all people know life is NOT fair. Oh well. So why does it piss me off so? Um.. I have no idea.    I get home tonite.. and think... Oh.. I can have a snack, no such luck. All the good snacks are eaten all up. It only took them two days this time. Least they gave me a chance so I could have some earlier today. I am mad at myself for putting Darian in  a group with Wil. She's picking up all his bad habits.   That guy came over today. His intentions were the same I believe. He didn't explain anything to me at all. It wasn't a bad visit though. I was nice to feel some affection. Hard to stave him off though. Least he knows that I don't trust him. Although I couldn't begin to tell him, why or.. why I did not want to date him. Um.. He's too agressive. I feel shy and reserved around him, maybe somewhat scared. I guess scared really isnt' the word. I don't what is the right word.    I also think about this other guy too much. When I go to sleep, when I wake... any time I have a chance. It's hard on me. I wish I could just forget, and make my life easier.  He is so unforgettable though. I know that he will never change his mind. But I wish he that he could.  I keep telling myself, that it's ok, and then he pops into my head again.  It's almost like a nightmare.    I am so unprepared for my test, and for finishing my essay. I guess I should work on them tommorrow. If only I have the time. The.. idiot guy, wants to see me again... and I didn't outright say no. I should of... but I didn't. So who knows, he will probably call. I am hoping not, I'm hoping he will just forget.

      I had some crazy dreams last nite. I dreamt that Jenn was visiting me, and I was too busy and lost track of time. I was almost 2 hours late for work… so I kept trying to dial the number and..  it wouldn’t work.. I kept miss dialing.. . I never did get thru.. but.. I tried for over a half hour.  I was crazy.  Things are going ok.. I keep telling myself.. to not see Matt again. I’m really pissed.  I don’t’ know what to think. Some girl was on his messenger last nite.. named Rachel.. and she was talking to me.. while he was playing a game. Should I want to date him? (um.. maybe) Should I even try? (NO) let him come to me.. if he wants something…. He needs to call me.  I guess.. overall it is just his loss. I am trying to move on already. If he wants to see me, that will be fine. But I’ve changed my mind and won’t take a day off for him.  Anyway..  it is hard.  It sucks  Well..  work is going good. I need to quit surfing the net and work on my homework. I guess the first step on this is to quit typing here.

      Well.. I"m back.. back again..     Um.. things are going better. Having a nice time here at Susan's house. Not sure what to do about getting an apartment though. I'm going crazy. I really don't want to pay for a storage unit another month. Reminds me.. I need to give them my new address.   I think I'm receiving mixed signals from Matt. He seems a little stand offish.. but always I'ms me immediately upon my arrival online. I dont' get men. Um.. I just .. well.. I really would like to date him.. I think( he's not the only one.. but anyway) But.. I dunno what to think. I think Matt just came online.. and ..  he did.. and he I'med me already. Um.. he was kind of iffy though when I asked him.. to go to the movies with me Sunday. I guess we will see.  Well.. I thought.. i would have a good nite.. and go to bed early.. but Darian woke up.. so I'm sure I will have a hell of a time. I also finally got my first Draft of my essay done. I hve a feeling I will be printing off my final draft right before class.. I am going to try and make it to the writing center tomorrow for help..  I just hope Wil will be around to babysit for me.  well I'm doing good on writing here more often. I guess it may also help with my writing skills. I also gave another friend the link to this.. so I will have more people reading this. Mostly .. I regret.. giving the link to one person.. ( I think) because then I can't write about him.. with out him knowing how i feel about him.    I also clicked on this link from Michel blog.. and this is the link.. that it said I could publish.. I hope this works..  I'm a Sex on the Beach,  urlLink discover your ALcoHoLiC personality!

      I don't know what my problem is today. I can't stop crying.  I walked into this room earlier.. and was glad that I removed the knifes from here a few days ago. I was under so much tension, and sadness, I wanted to hurt myself. I am somewhat glad there was not a knife within reach. I hate feeling like this. My life seems so hopeless. I am seriously contimplating... leaving after next semester of school.. going back to PA.. and try to be satisfied making 5.15 an hour at the local store. Can I be happy that way.?  What do I really want in life? I want to be loved, and to fit in. I don't know that I will ever feel those things. I haven't allowed myself yet. I'm scared, today is part of my moving on. I hope I have enough money by the end of the month.. to move. I am doubting i will. I can't even find anything that I need. I hate this.  I must go now.. I have a splitting headache.

      Overall, I had a good day. I just had to tell someone something, I did not want to tell him, but because I am an honest person. I had to tell him. I told him about my secret. The secret I only have to tell close people, that have an interest in having sex with me. I wish that there was not such thing as sex sometimes.   I also initiated a strange conversation with another friend. Although, the response I got was strange.. I learned a few things.    Well, back to the orginal someone. Now he says.. he will still come over, and that we can be friends... but no sex.  I really don't want sex though.. I seem to go after it though. I don't know what I'm trying to prove. I just want to feel loved. I always go about it the WRONG way.  Well this guy..   I sort of told him, I didnt' want to see him agian, and since I'm moving... and he's leaving in a few weeks... I'm not sure if I will. I guess we will see.  I really like him, and right now my heart aches... I feel so sad.  I guess I will go to bed now, and hope to dream... of maybe the cure to my sexual problem.. and to the rest of my problems. I want to dream only of happiness and love.

      Gosh, I haven't written in here in quite a while. Things are going pretty good. I'm about to move out. Having a little trouble letting go. I will miss the internet and my friends. It will be hard for me. I do have some other good news. No.. I did not win the lottery.. I'm still broke. :)  Well, this guy, that I've been chatting with.. and actually I've been chatting for over a year I believe. Well, he just got back from Korea, (he's in the army). And he came and helped me move. He is really nice. I'm really attracted to him. It is nice to give and receive affection. I went over to his house today. It was very nice. Sweet, and he acts like such a gentleman. Not sure where this is going... but it doesn't seem like a bad thing. Not sure that I want something serious, because he will be leaving again soon. But.. having someone nice to spend time with is wonderful.  I've been doing good in school also. Averaging A's & B's it seems. I have another essay to write. I'm worried about the move. I am paranoid, I will not have enough money. I will miss my friends online. They keep me sane. I will definately miss chatting with Michel nightly. Haven't seen him much this week though.    I got my Box-address today. I got it at Mailboxes Etc. It was like 45 dollars.But it will work, for what I need it to work for. Can't wait to have my own apt. I feel like I will never have the money. I wish things were easier.. but that is life.  Um.. I've skipped work all week. I have not been feeling that great.  Well I am tired and shall go to bed... hopefully will keep up with my blog better... if at all possible.

      My sadness has come back. I can sometimes keep that positive attitude, but then days like this hit. I feel sad and tears in the edges of my eyes.. for most the day now. What is wrong with me? Does the medicine really help? I never know what to think. I don't know what to think on days like this.   Now my gram is making me feel more sad, or I should say, I'm letting her make me feel sad. She is saying she isn't coming to D.'s birthday party. What a fucking crock of shit. Why do people have to be like that, for no reason. My gram is depressed herself.  I am missing my C. He wasnt online today, that I know of. I stayed online till 15 after 3 and he didn't come online. I left him a message, saying please leave me a message if you are online or email me, and I haven't heard anything from him. It makes me sad and worried, especially after him being so upset yesterday about his sister. And I still don't know what all is going on with that.  I hope all is alright. I wish he was here now though. His smile, his eyes, his loving words, could help cheer me up. I hate depression. I hate sadness. I know I need to expect it.  It's not like it is even PMS either. I understand the sadness when that comes. But of of the blue I have the blues today. I was extremely anxious at the doctors today. But luckily he was very friendly and seemed down to earth. He is not the regular doctor at the center though, which kind of sucks.   I had dreams my wheel of my car fell off last nite. I can't imagine anything like that happening. I need to get the oil changed and get my car looked at though. I hope to get that done soon.  Well, I am feeling too sad to write any more today, so I will end my post here.

      A new day, brings new thoughts, new fears. I hope today is the best day, of my life, because I only want things to get better. I know it takes some hard work, and a lot of time. I know that I have discovered my true love. I know it to be true. Thru all the disagreements, I've never felt I don't love him. A year ago, I would of never thought, that C. and I would become so close. I feel it was meant to be. I know we will be together soon, and I can't wait until that first moment, my first moment in my wonderland. NO, I am not Alice... I am Jae  :)    Note to self: I have to start working out again, I'm gaining weight. blah!

      Wow, it's too early for me to be up, but I had to get on and post, because last nite, Well I dreamt of my "perfect" wedding. Well needless to say it was imperfect, but I was still happy, because I was with my love. I want to write this down, to see if I can find an interpertation of it later:  Starts out that my whole family goes there, by that , I basically mean my sisters, A., her fiance, and baby Jaz, and S., my other sister. So we fly to Europe( I suppose so that part wasn't in the dream).  We are at C.'s flat, which in the dream is more like a huge loft. And  I hardly see C. while we are there. We basically make ourselves at home, and show ourselves around. We talk briefly with C.'s sister, and neice.   Then the wedding day comes. We are in our dresses, running around like chickens with our head cut off, and I haven't any nice shoes.. I look around and around.. and shop (at a store convienantly located in the house, and find nothing.. so I basically end up wearing some old shoes I had that were like slippers and white. And then, we have no flowers or decorations, so we use some flowers that C. has in his house, and the same for decorations.    We get married, and it looks like a zoo, no organization at all, but we look happy. Then afterwards, C is on a bicycle and wanting to ride down the hill, and I hop on the bicycle with him, and we race down the hill. ( I am thinking .. WTF.. and laughing at the same time)   Also some things that happen in the dream, is that D. gets sick, and some guy I know, supposedly in the dream, a Doctor, comes to fix her up. I get this bad feeling and stop him. In the meantime someone has called the cops. We find out he was trying to poison her.  It was very scary.  Then, part of the dream we find out C. had a twin brother.. (who looks nothing like him) this guy is raggedy and apparently he is always in the basement, working.  I figured he's either a strange artist or a slave in the dream.   Then, something I forgot, before C. and I ride off on the bicycle, we talk to his uncle. His uncle wants to buy this book, apparently an antique, and C. says he can have it for 15 dollars..  Uncle opens the book and laughs, saying it is worth much more. C. just shruggs, uncle hands him some money, and C. hands it to me.  I start counting the money, it is much more than 15 dollars.   That is all I can remember of the dream right now, but maybe later some more will come to me. I got to get going, got a long day ahead of me. I am going to school with D. to help with the kids on the bus.

      I hate the pain of life, of living. These are the time, I sometimes wish I was dead. I can't stand the emotions, that flutter thru my mind, my soul, my heart. I don't know how to handle the pain. I don't know what to say. I don't know how to share. I just want it all to stop.   I can probably say I am doing better in my life, because I am NOT going to kill  myself today. I will have to fight the feeling though. It will be hard... It is extremely overwhelming now.  I told C. over the weekend about the whole thing with I.  I didn't know how he'd reacte, and I guess even though I told him, I still don't know. He's always so quiet. I guess I use sarcasm more than I've ever realized. He pointed that out to me, so I will have to learn to note that to  myself, so I can try to change that bad habit. It hurts though. I don't like feeling stupid. I feel that we are argueing, and then he says things I don't understand.   Now I am about in tears, trying to cry for fear of letting it hurt more.  This is something I will always remember, C. Says "i've never regreted whatever i've been doing in my life so far", then says "please,...PLEASE,don't make me this time" And I say, "please what  honey?" and then it hits me.. he is talking about us.. and our relationship. and then I say" Regret what? us?"and he says yes.  I feel like I was just stabbed in the chest. I'm about in tears. I only fear the tears because my grandma and daughter are in the next room, and I don't want to share my pain with them.  I am starting to think maybe getting off the meds was a bad idea. Now I am thinking more clearly, and I keep more things in my head and I don't like this. I don't like feeling this pain. At least with the medication I was mostly numb. I don't know how to handle stress. I don't know how to live in the real world. How do I do it, How do I survive. Survive without the knifes, the blades, and pills.  I'm hoping writing is the key, writing and sharing. So far it is starting to work, but it can't solve all my problems.

      So, what to think, what to do I have no idea. I feel my best friend, JB, should know these things going on, but is it my place to tell her. I don't want to be the bad guy. I., her husband, was trying to hit on me again. And right in front of his nephew. I was like WTF, what a creep. He actually was good to JB most of the day. He helped some with the kids, something I have never seen him do. But then, when we all were back at the house, with the family, he says in a mean tone... "JB, Put those kids to be, before my brother gets here., Go in the room and put them to bed."  Her children are 2 and 6 months, and he hardly helps, I don't know how she deals with it.  Everyone says marriage is different, but I know that mine will. I know my husband will take more of a part in our childrens life, and of D.'s. I find that he would be like this, because he loves them, and me. If a father is limitedly involved like I. is with his kids, what the fuck kind of father is that. I raised D., on my own, and she knows I loved her. If her father was part of her life, and acted like I. does.. I would tell him to leave, because it would help her if he was gone more than it hurt her. I find in some ways I will have a lot of adjusting to do, because I am not used to anyone helping. I do know that C. and I will have a lot of open communication, and that when things don't work the way they should, that we will talk about it.   Right now I am missing C. so much. I am wishing I was in his arms. Between the events of today, and being exhausted(partly because of meds) and partly emotionally exhausted because of the events the last few days, I am being pretty lonely, and wishing that C. was here right now. I would love to be looking in to his sexy brown eyes, and feeling his arms around me as we kiss. :)     Emotionally I am pretty drained, I shared with C., many things I thought he should know, that were hard for me to tell. I can say he did take them well, but the conversation hurt our feelings a bit. I just so wanted him to know these things, so he could take a step back and to make sure this is what he really wanted, was me .. and D.  I think he loves D. as much as he loves me, if not more. The way he acts towards her is so precious. She acts about the same though. She thinks C. is great, and she can't wait till he comes to America. :)  Only a few more days on the Effexor. Partial called and hopefully I will start the hospital next week, that will be great. I could really use the support. Only thing that sucks though, is missing my talks with C. We will survive though.  :)   As the deer walks thru the forest, I hear the wind brush over the leaves, Water dripping over rocks, A cool, fresh breeze.  Life is so precious, Always meant to be, I'll tell you my dreams, and show you, One day you will see.  I will show you rainbows,  sorrow and joy, I will show you love,  without being coy.  I will kiss your precious lips, I will show you love, Almost like a rainbow, and a flying dove.  Love is something special always meant to be, Love is something great, Just like you and me.

      I hate this feeling. The sadness the shame. Months ago, when I couldn't figure out what was happening to me, I became close with my best friends husband. Too close, and I couldn't stop him at the time, because I was scared, alone, and because having attention felt good. I made a mistake, and am still living with it. I am crying as I type this, because now, I have told C. and I feel like he has no understanding of the situation. I was so fucked up back in June.  I cried whenever I was alone. I could not stand it. I let his words go thru my mind, because I trusted him, and he wasn't to be trusted. What do I do? I mean, he tells me he is only with my friend now because of the kids. What kind of marriage is that? My friends deserves so... so much more.  But I don't want to be the reason they are not together. I want her to see for herself.  Last nite, he tried to kiss me, he tried to basically molest me. I repeated told him no, and he still didn't get it until I called him an asshole. He seriously, although, I have pushed him away repeatedly, thinks I want to fuck him. I didn't want to in the first place, but it happened. I can't change the past, I can only make the future different.  I refuse to let the feelings I have defeat me again. I will not cut myself to make things better, I will not cry when I am alone. I will figure this out oneday. I just hope it is oneday soon.

      Wondering Wondering, It seems all that I do, Why do I have to always wonder about you? I do not want to, I want to try, to stop wondering  why?  I had a pretty uneventful nite. The things that happen right now, I can not talk about. I am in Pittsburgh now, visiting my best friend. I will update more, when I get back to my home and my own space, so I can right more freely.  I'm still in a good mood, doing good despite the fact that I have forgoten my meds from this morning, and took them at 3pm.  I have only a few more days and I am off the Effexor. :)  I am getting currently upset by C. I am talking to him on MSN, and I am feeling that he doesn't trust me, because my uncle was on my yahoo messenger of something.  I just don't understand what is going on in his head.  I wish I could understand more.  Oh well, I guess men and women were not meant to understand each other all the time. I do love him so much. The feeling of us together makes me feel so happy.

      You think of your best friends, and you wonder what has changed over the years. So much has changed, yet we still stay in touch... why? Is it some internal obligation we feel. I love them, but I don't feel the love from them like I used to. I mentioned to my best friend S. that we don't talk as much as we used to, and she didn't quite understand.  I guess I felt bad, when she didn't understand, cuz it was hard for me to say in the first place. I spent the weekend with her, and some of it was like old times. It's just maybe it is me, I'm not as open with her as I used to be. We both have so many problems, problems we don't know how to solve.  I wish that we both find our true happiness someday.  I know, in my heart that we will.

      C.,  he officially asked me to marry him today. Then he started having all the worries of our future like I did. It was good to know that he had the same worries. Made me feel less crazy. He is just so wonderful, sometimes it doesn't real. Sometimes it feels so real.   My daughter made me realize, I need to do what is going to make me happy, and to try and not worry of the future. SHe is very interested about babies, and I try to explain to her the best I can. SHe was talking about babies growing inside me, and I tried to explain to her, that there needed to be a daddy for me to have a baby. I told her I would hope to have more babies after I am married. She told me I could marry my boyfriend C., and that the builders could build us a house and we could all live together. It was very cute. She is always optimistic, and makes things seem so easy to do. It was just cute, I guess you had to be there to actually see it.   I'm at the point now, where if we get along when we meet I don't feel I will have anxiety about getting married. I feel we communicate well, and can work thru anything if we really want to. This is what I've really always wanted was to be married, and to have my own family. I feel that if it isn't meant to be, I will change my mind beforewords. I have never gotten this close really to marriage. I am actually making plans. My gramma doesn't think it will happen, and if it doesn't  it doesn't. I have made a wonderful understanding friend.  He is a wondeful man. He has been here by my side, thru the worst in my life.   I have so many things I feel I need to tell him. Things I rarely share with anyone. I know they won't change his mind about me, but it is something that needs to be said.  I am having one of those headaches again. Trying not to take my meds, cuz I only have one pill left. I am about to break down though. I went to bed with a headache, and since I had a rough nite. My horn on my car woke me up twice last nite, cuz apparently it shorted... and was going off insistently. I still have that headache. I hate this feeling.   I had more dreams last nite. Can't remember quite what they were right now. I don't like these dreams much. I am almost off the Effexor though, down to 75 mg. Only a week or so to go.  Still trying to get into a day program at the hospital, I have a lot of work to do on myself.

      A new life, but not a new blog. Kind of partial to this one. I have started a new life recently, and also decided to write a book about my whole life. So what better than this blog to help organize my thoughts for my book.  Part of my whole new life is shaving my head. I have shaved it three times. I went thru a phase where I wasnt growing or getting better like I planned but worse. Now I have come to realize so many things, and am letting my hair grow, and my life is growing with it. I am starting to heal. I have a long journal, and many paths and dead ends along the way.  I have been on alot of medications, and currently trying to get off. I want my mind to be clear. I have recently fallen in love. C, well I love him dearly, he has been a great support to me thru all this. We do have our ups and downs, but when I speak and chat with him, I am overjoyed with love and affectionate feelings. It feels good, to know someone loves me. JP has also helped me thru this. I write to him when I feel down. Most people don't think he is really a good person, but I know in his heart he is. He would give his life for his loved ones. He has led a troubled life like myself, only he never really had any LOVE or SUPPORT at all. I hope to go and see him soon. Sort of as a closure, to the love we had... because I am moving on with my life.  I have to move on soon, and make a place for myself, I am almost strong enough. I few more weeks or months, will tell. I will know, I will feel it in my heart when I am ready. Until then, I will just stay put. Hard, but tolerable.   I will end this tonite, mostly because I am tired and have a long day tommorrow. I am helping A help herself, which is a good thing. But it means I have to get up early. Blah, definately not a morning person.   More updates about my life in the last (almost year) tommorrow.  :)  Till then, I go to bed with a big smile on my face, because I know tommorrow will be a good day.

BItching for an hour on what to have for dinner. I didn't want any dinner, I am not hungry, nor feeling good.  BItching because I swore in front of my daughter. That is my business, not hers. I hate being here. I know Darian feels the stress, but I still don't know what to do or say. I don't belong here, I know that.  I am just soo tired, this is the second day of tiredness.. (well half the day yesterday) earlier in the day yesterday, I worked my butt off, and Gram of course didnt appreciate it.  Also today is the third day for my headache. I wish they would go away. I guess that is life.   Today, in group, they asked me all kinds of questions about my relationship with C. I answered them all. I realistically believe C. and I are meant to be together, and that we can have a healthy relationship.

I feel that C. and I will be great together, and I want to share my life with him. I've missed him today. We missed each other online. I had an errand to do, and then I forgot to do something and I had to go back to Bradford. I was so mad. I got that game returned though. Thank goodness.  I get to go on a field trip with Darian to a farm. Hope I am feeling better tommorrow. I had one of my headaches today. Darian will be sleepy, she was up late tonite. I feel bad.. cuz she is cranky and sleepy. I feel it has something to do with the tensions of living here. I wish I could do something.

Sure at first that is what I want to, I want to spend time getting to know him more, and showing him how much I love him, but after a while, I will become cranky and irratable and depressed. I need time to myself, as well as with my friends and family.  I also worry excessively of our finances once he is here. I worry of that all the time, but I wonder how we will get by. I just so much, want to share my life with him, sometimes I am afraid to step up and say what is really on my mind. I've had too many years of pretending nothing is wrong, so it is hard for me to speak up. That is why I am glad that I can write, because it helps me get things out.

        urlLink )"  title="Comments by SquawkBox.tv"> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )    This was sent to me in my BPD group online. Not sure where they found it, but it really hit the spot on how I feel most of the time.  I'm a borderline   that no one listens to   a borderline   that no one sees.   Every day I deal with problems   that seem normal   to everyone but me.      I am unworthwhile as problems go-   I really have it all together,   totally capable in any way.   No one can see me   incapacitated by my own anxiety   immobilized by fear and stress   hidden underneath a sheath   of everyday.      I took some Prozac   to feel better.   A nice band-aid   to cover the spot   of internal bleeding.   It worked.   but I'm still losing jobs   and I am still imploding relationships   like too many seagulls   on alka-seltzer.   But at least I can   better achieve the   glossy, high- quality   fakeness   that feeds everyone's expectations.       They made me president of a club.   They made me captain of the team.   They made me super-counselor at camp.   And editor of the paper.   They  believed I could do it.   I failed every one.   And someone else stepped up   cleaned up   the mess I left behind.   Somehow I fooled every one of them   into thinking that I could do it.      After two months, I quit my job at the beach.   After four, I quit the paper.   I lasted two months at the Nile,   and a whole eight weeks at camp.   A single month as a janitor of the second floor.   A whopping seven months at the department store.   And Last but not least, after two months I was  fired from fine  dining.   I've never had a job I've liked- or been able to  keep.   And I was really trying at the last one.      I told Dylan, Scott, Chris, Ben, and Dustin   in whispers so sweet   "I'd love them forever."   "That this time was different."   I'm the most amazing woman.   I'd convince them, each   in his own language.   And when he was finally convinced,   I'd run away, and   abandon him at love's door,   with nothing more than an intense desire   to escape NOW   fueling my getaway.      Me, the borderline.   Living every day   my life meter switch   stuck on "survival."      Through periods of anger   I have several mementos.   Three punched holes   in three different walls.   A scratched, dented car.   Scratched, cut skin.   A piercing.   Many miles of gasoline   used up in silent crying, destination-   "anywhere but here."   Smoking cigarettes, smoking weed. Drinking my  health to the floor.  Impulse purchases- blades, clothes, bags, books,  and twenty different  bottles of shampoo. Screaming obscenities at  people I love, building  a firewall of hate for no reason. Insensible as  it all is, I sit  here, a borderline, this is my everyday. Regretting my behavior. Dragging my feet through  work each shift  takes every ounce of energy I have   My relationships are a mystery to me- something I  will never  understand. Anger and depression are doors I try  unsuccessfully to  hold closed. I am nothing but a fake- hoping to  somehow achieve  normalness by convincing you that I am.

Seriously-being positive only makes me dream and hope for more and so when I don't get it-all I get is greater dissappointment. I don't want that. But I don't wan this life I have now either. I want to be happy. I want to be normal.-Whatever the hell that is.  I have realized I need to move away now more than ever. The only reason I don't cut here is because I'm in the "good girl" role- that I've always been in. I hate it, I loathe it. It consumes me.   Darian has been cranky lately, Why I ask? I think because of my moods. I think she feels what I feel - just like I empathize with others.   I hate my fantasies of the future. How can they ever come true? They can't because I don't deserve happiness. Do I believe this is true? For the most part. Well I will continue this when I get home, if I make it. (NOTE: I orginally wrote this in my journal at home, and am retyping it, as I will do with other entries from my DAY/NIGHT journal) Well, I am home-Unfortunately my grandma is still awake. All I thought about on the way home is how my life is a sham and how me nor anyone  else knows how things will turn out in the future. I also really want to talk to C. Now I'm thinking oh, yeah, I should break it off with him. Before I give him a chance to bring pain in my life. Who knows that he will or won't though.   THere is no God. SO.. I guess I'll never find out. Life & everything in it is a sham, it is not reality.I don't understand how I can be so intelligent and dumb at the same time. I have coping skills and i chose not to use them tonite, so I feel like shit. Least it is a real feeling and I'm not pretending my life is a dream world anymore.I plan on taking the risperadol I found along with my tother meds and see if that helps anyway. Can't hurt. I don't have enough for that sort of thing. My negative thinking again. I  I just dont' get life, and why my family is so fucked up. A. has to have everything her way and it's just easier to give in to her. Hell she's had 18 years of training. 18 years of being in charge. ANd i let her, just as my parents die. What do I do though? I can't make her change.How do I cope with her?  I'm so confused in my life. I don't know how to fix it. I feel broken. I feel lost and hurt. I feel scared. I don't know how to feel any different. I don't know how to feel happy and be realistic at the same time. How? I wish I did. I wish to learn that someday.   I'm so scared that C. and I won't work out. Seriously am I being realistic, I mean I'm in love and engaged to a man I've never met. It's strange, yes. Everyone is negatie about it though. I just really don't see the difference between this and arranged marriages. I mean they don't even meet their husbands/wifes until they are married or shortly before. I am very commited and C and I were friends before we wanted to date. We want some of the same things- a better education, a family, someone to hold, and love and share with. We both share a disbelief in God. For once, I found someone who is like me and just doesn't believe because everyone else does. We like the same music. Both like the internet. of course. :) I just don't know where I should go with this. I mean. Well. If I break up with him, I'm feel like I'm running away, I'm pushing him away. I feel like I haven't given "us" a chance. If I stay, I feel like, I'm not living in a real world. What do I do? Where do I go from here. It's scary, its' unreal.   I wish I could just move- and go somewhere far away. Away from here, away from the mess that I've created of my life. I want to be held. I want to be loved. How do I heal myself without C.? I don't know. But I don't want to be completely dependant either. How do I find the in between, that my personality doesnt want me to? How do you become independantly dependant or how do you find the healthiness in being both?    I do not know, I do not care.  I do not want to go over there.  I do not want to stay here  either.  I do not want to become a believer.  I want to find out  who I am.  I want to find out if my life  is a sham.  I just want the truth to be seen.  I want to see the in between.

        urlLink )"  title="Comments by SquawkBox.tv"> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )    Not even sure where to start. So much has been going on. I attended a class yesterday about young children’s behaviors, and tried to relax and couldn’t. My sister had me run her to Bradford, and unfortunately the money I was expecting did not come and no one knows why. That upsets me greatly. I did, however, get a check from TN from Walter for child support. I wish it would come regularly, but I don’t ever expect that.   Today I went to partial. I got really emotional. I don’t feel like I’m much in control. I’ve realized I’m not meeting most of my needs. Right now, one of the things that bother me the most is bothering me right now, my grandma. Can’t she see that I am busy and shut up? This is what drives me crazy the most. She always invades my personal space, and doesn’t expect anyone to want privacy. I think she was born on a different planet.   I really need to get out of my grandma’s house, but in the same token I am scared. Scared of how I will be when I am alone. I don’t want anything to happen like before. I felt so scared and alone. I was terrified of being alone. Terrified to go to sleep, terrified of myself. I don’t like that feeling. I will try my hardest not to ever feel that way again.   I am now getting sleepy. Something I hate, I hate feeling sleepy and tired. I feel lazy because I can never get enough done. Why? Because I spend a lot of time online. Online time keeps me sane though. I get to write here, on my blog, talk to the love of my life, and also to a few of my friends and family. It gives me some emotional support, and helps make up for my lack of physical touch.   I read a story today; it’s been going around lately. It was about the US landing on the moon, and trying to prove that they didn’t. I don’t know enough about the moon, to say whether I believe it or not. I really have no opinion. I wonder about other people, and what points they would argue though.  Some of the things I learned in that class the other day were helpful. They helped me realize why my sisters and brothers and I have no respect or value to my mother’s words. It makes me realize it was my mother’s lack of parenting skills, and that my sisters and brothers are not bad kids. Just hurt, mislabeled and neglected.  I still find it hard to let go. I have to though, because I will not be around forever, and because they are pretty much grown up. I have to realize, that I can’t make them change, and I can’t really shape them anymore, because they have already been molded. It’s hard though. They are “my kids”.  I have to work on my own parenting skills, and be the best mom to my daughter. So that she can grow up to be a good productive adult.   One thing that the lady said yesterday that I didn’t really agree with was… that she as a parent would want her kids to have a better work ethic, rather than a high IQ and a good personality. I wouldn’t. My grandmother has the highest work ethic I have ever seen, and worked for this company 25 and some odd years. My dad has worked half that time, and he makes more than she does. What kind of bullshit is that? I couldn’t say. I want my children to be intelligent, and not take any bullshit. I do think they should have good work ethic, but I don’t think that should be the highest priority on the list.

      I sometimes wish I had more time to write, but what would I write? It mite get boring if I write too much. ƒº Well, anyway, my day was pretty uneventful. Went to the hospital, chatted with C. and checked email. Checked out some beautiful wedding dresses online. Stuff like that. I feel kind of out of it today though. A little dizzy and out there. Not sure if it is just my body getting over the sickness, or another bad side effect from another medication. I guess I will find out in a few days, if I still feel crappy.  Got to go for a walk today, just down to the post office, but it got me out of the house. Now if the weather could always just be as nice as it is today.  I worry about my grammas dog, Curly. She¡¦s been snapping a lot at my daughter. Yes my daughter does do some things to agitate, but today, Curly just snapped at her when she was trying to get a blanket from behind her. I just hope she doesn¡¦t bite my daughter. I will raise holy hell if she does. My gram needs to get that dog to the vet; something is just not right with her. She has coughing fits and stuff.   Why is the meaning of life such a mystery? I sometimes wonder this, like now. But if we knew the meaning of life, why would we go on living. My guess is that we wouldn¡¦t. It¡¦s hard for me to look back at the times, and realize that I really wanted to die. I did. Sometimes I still do, but I realize that I have a lot to live for. I want to change people¡¦s lives, and I have my whole life to do that. I don¡¦t know how exactly I will do that just yet, but I will. I have faith. I think that has a lot to do with wanting to life. The faith and trust in the future. Without faith, or something positive to look forward to, what is there? Nothing. With nothing, there is no future; with no future there is no reason to live. I¡¦ve felt exactly that way, way too many times to count.  I feel happiness inside most of the time now. When I do feel sad, I try to think of the good things in life. Sometimes they are so hard to remember though, because they are clouded by the negative things.   I found some old journals I had written a while back. I am hoping to get a chance to reread them tomorrow, if there is anything interesting, I will post some of the things here.  Well, it is about my bedtime so I will sign off now.   urlLink )"  title="Comments by SquawkBox.tv"> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )

      I think I learn alot, by reading other peoples blogs. Tonite, I read M.'s cuz i wanted to update myself with what was going on in his life. Always something  new. I still don't know what to think about him having a gf. It always surprised me. Probably cuz I had a crush on him at the time. I am happy for him though. I of course, had to go check out his gf's blog. And seems they had a great weekend. Though, my opinion on M.'s religion, is different than his gf's. I have always found M to be quite religious. Way more religious than any I know. Most people I know, don't even care if they attend services. I find from what I have learned about the Jewish religion that most are more religious than Christians. Christians don't always bring there religion to every aspect of there life like other religions do, (this includes Muslims). Well there are different types of Christians, but the biggest, is the Real Christians, Vs.. the C&E Christians.  (C&E - Christmas and Easter). I was told that my a friend of mine that is a Youth Minister. I don't know how people can stay so positive about their religion when they see so much evil in the world.  But anyway.. if anything i just said made any sense I'd be surprised, but I had to say something, because I find my friend, M. to be very loyal to his religion, sure he has become Americanized, but..  I would find it hard for anyone to not become that way. Reminds me of a how i watched the other day, about a Amish boy that had went to the "BIG" city to see what is was like. All he saw was evil and dismay. He decided he wanted to be Amish, and not go out on his own, and stay in the big city. His comment to the doctor that was showing him around, was...  "Have you ever seen a homeless Amish man?  The Amish stick together and take care of each other."   Wouldn't it be nice if everyone could be that way. IF everyone could have the ability to really care about others. To give themselves to others.    But anyway.. (again...)  I am off to bed.. Goodnite, I send my love to all that read this.

      I have so much on my mind; I don’t know where to begin. I’ve been sick for the last few days... well since Friday to be exact. That was the day that I started my new meds; guess what, my stomach did not appreciate them. A bad reaction, not actually called allergic, but went back to the doctor today, and they suggested I stop that medication and just eat and drink what was tolerated. It sucks. I’ve been sick to my stomach all weekend. I was finally able to eat with out being sick. Luckily.  Still have a headache and stomach pain though. Who would have known? I’ve never had stomach problems with my meds. Oh well.   I’ve been really emotional. I’m off the Effexor. I think I am doing well. C., well he always cheers me up. I love being with him (even though it is online) and just thinking about him. My mood just went from about 4 to about 9.999999 just typing this message about him. I’m so in love. I just hope my heart doesn’t get ahead of myself on this one. I only wish to be happy more times than I am sad. &#61514;  I’m watching a movie on lifetime, so my thoughts may be a little distracted, I’m writing during commercials cuz I want to go to bed in the next half hour. Well, about C., I love him so much. Lately my heart, body and soul have ached for him so much. I don’t understand how I can be so in love with a man that I have never met, but I believe in love, and I know that he and I will give all that we have to make each other happy. He seems so open to my needs, and to the fact that I am not perfect. I am a perfectionist though, and that makes it hard for me to accept that my life isn’t. I want things to be as close to perfect as they can be. I do know that bad things and sadness will be in my life though. I have to accept that to get better.   I don’t know how much longer I can live here with my grandmother. The negativity gets to me. I don’t know how someone can be so negative. I know I do that to myself, but I’ve never that I can recall, tried to be so negative to others. I’ve always tried my hardest to make others happy. That is what makes me happy. I love to give myself to others, just is seems most people in my life take advantage of it. My whole family does. The only two people...  well three people... that haven’t are D, my daughter, C, my fiancé, and S, my best friend. I guess my other best friend J, hasn’t either, but I’m not sure where I stand with her. I’m working on trying to get up the courage to help her, because I will have to heal from this too. I want her to be happy.  So, this week I have lots to do. I will go to partial 3 days this week. I have a class I am attending on Wednesday about children’s behaviors, and will also go shopping.  And I have to write the invitation for my fiancé, and also get the applications and get them filled out for housing. Not my first choice for wanting to live, but I have to get out of here. I don’t know how I will survive… but I know I can be strong until C. gets here. I don’t live living alone; I don’t think I ever have. I have always wanted my family to be there. I can’t wait to finally feel as if “my” family is complete. I can’t wait to be wed. I think it has always been my dream, and I can’t believe that soon, it will become a reality.  I can’t wait to give my love to him, and receive that same love back.  They way he looks at me makes me feel so special… it’s as if the miles that we are apart, aren’t really there.   Life is scary though. I don’t know why I ever changed my mind about living life, but I am glad I did. I wish I could help those that don’t feel that way. How do you help someone that really has no reason to live though? How do you help someone that feels no love? I think love is the greatest thing on earth. First the love of my daughter was the best thing that ever happened to me. It got me thru the first 2-3 years after her birth. She made me happy, everything she did, seemed so perfect. Then, she got an attitude. I realized I couldn’t live on her to make me happy. I had to, and have to find the happiness within myself. What makes me happy? A beautiful day, talking with friends, writing, both here and my poetry. My dreams of the future make me happy. C. makes me happy. Knowing I’m alive makes me feel happy. I’m looking for more things to find my happiness in, and I know one day, I will find them… but for now... its is time for me to take care of me, and get some beauty rest..  Tomorrow is another day.

      Wow, I realize no wonder i have been feeling bad. I've yet to blog since Tuesday. I've been feeling really shitty the last 3 or 4 days. I should write more when I feel crappy. I think part of it is the meds, and part of it is just life. I start partial on Tuesday. I went last Wednesday also, that started all the emotional feelings. Right now I've been talking with C. so I just feel fantastic, but just a few hours ago I felt hopeless, and worthless.  Its weird how things can change in just a few minutes. I few days,  a few weeks, a few months, a few years....    Things do change, and we have to adjust, I'm uncertain how to cope with my adjustments, and my stress. I'm hoping to learn new skills, to help me thru the uncertain times.  I love C. so much, and yet.. I sometimes wonder, what the fuck am I doing? But then on the other hand, I feel such love and tenderness from him. I find him unbelieveable attractive..  I desire him so much. I feel the love just thru our chatting online, and I wonder, can this really be true.  I can't wait to see him in the flesh.   I am hoping to see my brother tonite.. and if I don't get going I won't be able to do that.

I didn't take the Trazadone last nite either. I feel like I was a little rude to Calin today, when the things he did made my feelings hurt. I just don't know why I am so emotional, and so overly sensitive. The whole arguement we had was stupid, and I'm glad its over. Each time we do have an arguement, I feel closer in the end. I feel like we've always made a big step towards the better future that we both want.   My grandmother is driving me crazy. Ordering me around. Telling me she's going to put my cat to sleep, when she puts the dog to sleep. The dog is sickly. My cat is healthy and vibrant. I want to take my cat, and my daughter and leave. I've talked to my mom about staying with her. My brother agrees I can. I just have to talk to my stepdad. I don't know if I can handle it there much better either.   Either way...

        urlLink )"  title="Comments by SquawkBox.tv"> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )    Where to begin? I am thankful for what I have, Darian, Calin.. my aunt, my cat, my sisters and brothers.. and for all the things I do have. But..  I'm missing what I've always wanted, a real family. I don't feel like my family really loves me. They are not affectionate, and well, never have been that I can remember. Why is that a problem for me? I really don't know.   Ever since my first boyfriend, Clair, all I've really wanted to be was married. I dated him for 6 years on and off, and always thought we'd be married. We both talked about it alot, it seems, as I look upon those days. In the end it didn't work out, and I'm glad, because now I have Darian, and Calin, the two I am most thankful for having.   I know I can't change my family, but I don't feel I have to be around them like this either. I don't like it, and I certainly don't want it. I'm feeling very depressed and sad today. Missing my Calin. .. and missing what I want my holidays to be like. I can not wait till that is changed, and I can spend my holidays with him.   I guess I just want my family to do things for me like other familys do. To love me, to hold me.. to comfort me. I know that will never happen, but it is hard to accept. I want to be held, loved, and comforted, especially on days like today. I haven't had a family dinner in about 3 years..  so maybe that is why today was harder than I really even thought it would be.  I didn't realize till partial yesterday, though, how much I really didn't like holidays.  I've never really enjoyed them. They bring too much tension, just like Darian's birthday party did. I've had those suicidal thoughts, something I haven't had in a while. I just feel like my world is falling apart.  These headaches are really getting to me. I've had one almost everyday now for a week. The medicine takes care of them for the most part, but they are still very stressful. I don't know what to do about them.  That or my car. It sucks...   but oh well, that's life. I'm not lucky enough to get everything handed to me on a golden platter, like others I know. I've never been that fortunate, nor will I ever be. Which can be a good thing, because it makes me appreciate things more, and not take everything for granted.    Imagine being 16 years old, and your mom pouring you coffee, and making you toast for breakfast, and serving it to you. Imagine being 21 and having your own place with your boyfriend, and having your parents pay some bills, help fix your house, and also pay for the car you are driving, and the insurance. Imagine that. My parents haven't really done shit for me, and never will.  Nor would I ever even ask them for anything.

      Overall things are going good. C.'s modem took a crap, so he won't be online in the next few days.  Hopefully he will get some rest, that he really needs and deserves.   Well in my search to learn more about Romania.. I ran across this  urlLink website.  ..   I found her story.. most intrigueing and have been reading it for the last hour or so. (Many interruptions) I wanted to email her, but all I get is a error code. I found many of the recipes interesting, and wonder if C. uses any of them at his home. I therefore pretty much printed out all the soup recipes. Wish me luck.. lol :)   I feel so lucky to be alive, and know that life has good things in store for me. I just mailed out the invitation for C. and we are hoping to get an appointment soon. We just have an unanswered question.. and trying to get ahold of the Ambassy.. or something.  Wish us luck, I'm getting excited that we will marry in June if all goes well. urlLink

I waited two and half hours for Calin today. Something that seems to become a new habit of his. And where was he? At the pub, watching a game. Where does that put me as a priority in his life 0, where do I put him, prolly number 3, after taking care of Darian and myself. This pisses me off to no end. I'm even more pissed, because I get back online, to see if he's come home and ...  it shows he's offline, but he's really there, invisible.. and I wonder, what does he hide from? Me? Another woman? who?  Then he says only a few words, and I'm so angry I put myself on invisible.. cuz I don't know what to say. And he leaves. I really want to talk to him about all this, but because I'm angry I don't think I can. But I tried to call him anyway.. and no answer.   I'm beginning to wonder about all this. I don't know if its cuz he's so far away, of because of past boyfriends or what. But I'm beginning to think this is all bullshit. Him, me.. anything. Maybe he is using me to get a visa and live in America.. but then why would he suggest moving to another country ??  I don't know, but I didn't like that discussion either, about moving somewhere else, to start new, somewhere outside the US.   I'm now feeling so sad, I'm tring not to cry. I don't know what to do, to say to him. I don't know what to feel. I feel so FUCKING alone. I need someone right now. I think I'll go to a chat room and see what I can find.

I feel I rely on it too much for my own happiness. I want to find my true happiness, without having to be in a relationship. I do love C. so much. I truely do, he is so wonderful. Just I feel that lately...  he hasn't much time for me... and it hurts.  I don't want to feel that kind of pain, just because he is leading a normal life over in Romania.  I lead my life... and do many things here. Of course... I will hold out, and wait, and see what trying to be patient brings me. He is a wonderful man and I am grateful to share this time with him  I attended evening church with my brother tonite. I was wonderful. The pastor and their family was so loving and nice to be around. It was a different type of church than I'm used to, but would love to attend again.   I am grateful also to be alive today, and have shared my life with so many people....  I am so happy to be alive. My spirit has been awoken :)

No headaches, for about 4 days now !!! Terrific news!!  I feel alot of pain because I'm not as close to certain family members. I think back and its not any different from being in Wichita. No phone calls, no letters. Although I do see this person once in a while, I don't really get to talk to her. I hate it. I want to be closer to someone in my family. I want to really feel like someone cares. I mean this person decided on a date for an important event, and where it was going to be, and didn't bother to tell me, but told everyone else. I hate feeling like an outsider. I want my own family. I want my own place in life.  I want my own place in this world. Although it is a world, I would never want to own up to. It is an angry evil place. I want to find the good in life. I want to go with what I truely believe, that most people are good. I want to see it for myself though.   Not sure what else to say...  Although I am bothered, because Calin said I seemed to be cold lately. And then he wouldn't explain himself. It makes my heart ache. Although it already does because I miss him so. I keep having this feeling, that we are wasting our time, and no matter what we do, we won't be together. I know that is my negativeness, but no matter how much I try and stay positive about out future that comes to me.  I just feel like curling up in a ball and crying right now. Feeling so alone, and lonely..  and not wanted...  I'm hurting alot inside.  I need to be held. I need to be loved.   One day I will find what I need.

        urlLink )"  title="Comments by SquawkBox.tv"> javascript:SquawkBoxCount( )    I sit here realizeing that my life is going nowhere really fast. I don't know what to do. I feel stuck between wanting to rule the world, and wanting to go up to my bed, and sleep forever. I hate that I have to feel this emotional pain. I hate feeling the physical pain I feel almost on a daily basis. I fear going out and forgetting my medicine.   I am also sitting here feeling guilty for my grandmother having missing 120 dollars. It was only my sister and I in the house, and then the money was gone.  I know I didn't take it. Why do I feel so guilty. Because I allowed myself to let her in. She's my fucking sister for Christ sake. I didn't steal the money, I don't have any proof she did either. But either way, I'm not responsible. Then why do both my grandma and my aunt find me responsible. Maybe cuz my whole family is fucked up. I shouldn't have to feel guilty for something I didn't do, I have enough guilt on my shoulders, from things I did do  I'm also feeling bad because I've no wedding plans yet. Calin wants me to wait till he is here, and it is driving me nuts. So nuts that I'm having negative thoughts about the whole thing. I guess I just don't want to be ill prepared. That and I guess I'm jealous, cuz my gram is helping Sally, and I know that noone will help me with my wedding plans. It drives me crazy. I just wish I could feel as if I belonged to a part of my family. I know in my head, that I never will though.  Something else I wanted to ponder. The other day in partial.. I played the most violent sport on earth. It was ping pong. YOu should of been there. I almost got my head taken off. It was all in good fun though.   Thoughts:  a little confused, erriatic, negative, and a little suicidal Interruptions: positive affirmations, and positive reinforcement.   I am trying to enjoy my life, its a hard struggle though.

      Went out last nite. Had a great time. Went with my new friend M., first to a Greek Restaurant, which was cozy and wonderful. I had veal with mushrooms(yuck) and artichoke hearts(first time for everything again.. but not the best thing in the world) with some pasta.. which tasted great. Also tried grape leaves, which were really really wierd.  After that went to the mall, got some Italian ice cream, gelato I think its called, peanut butter... it was great..  yummy (so much for the diet.. hahah) walked around the mall (my feet are killing me.. lol -damn high heels) went to Electronic Boutique, one of my fav places in the mall. Didn't really see any new games out though. Had a good deal on Cruise Ship Tycoon though, 15 dollars I think. I wish I had money to spend on a new game...  like I need a new game.  Then.. after that, thought we could catch at 9 o'clock movie, so went to I think its called On Cue... its a music place right by the theatre and checked out the music. Went to the theatre only to find out the movie didn't start till 10. So.. we decided to buy our tickets, and he was out of ideas, So I suggested we go hang at Wally World.. lol (Wal-Mart).  So we browsed the toys, played with a few, sword faught, and talked about stories of the good ole days.. and I told him stories of my daughter.. and stuff like that. It was fun. Then we went and watched the movie, Big Fish. Good Movie!! Two Thumbs up..  hehehe..    It was  both funny and romantic, wasn't expecting the romantic part.  Good film for both chics and guys.. lol.  Well.. after the movie.. I went to the bathroom.. (of course) and went to wash my hands.. and they had auto faucets..  AUTO my ass.. they wouldn't work. So i came out.. (with soap in my hand.. and was like M. any men in that bathroom. ... he was like no.. I went in the mens.. and it wouldn't work either. I was ticked..  LIke what the hell.. NO running water?  So..  I came out and there was the water fountain..and he suggested i rinse there.. and so I did.. so if you ever taste soap.. blame  it on someone like me.. lol   SO after that I was looking for the manager.. and No.. employers were anywhere..    what luck blah  All is well that ends well..  It was a great nite!!  Sooo..   although last nite I didn't get much sleep because I had to get up very early to take my gram to my Uncle (great) Alvin's funeral, I'm doing alright. In pretty good spirits. Thought about guns, but no suicidal intentions. No cuttings. Was glad to see family I hadn't seen in years. I was lucky. Got pulled over by a police man for not having a inspection sticker, and he realized I had Kansas plates and apoligized for his mistake and let me go. Thank God. Because I don't have insurance on my car, and would of been in big trouble. Somebody was with my today. I have to say in the last 24 hours I have been a very lucky woman. Even though, I did get my car stuck in the deep snow in front of my mothers house.. and had to wait 3-4 hours for my step dad to come home and help me get it out.. and it (of course) only took him..  well like 2 minutes to get it unstuck.. lol (MEN... LOL)    Well anyway.. enough of my adventures. My spirits are bright, although my mind/heart/spirit/ are a bit confused as to what to do in my future and to what path do I chose. So.. .  I know.. to just move forward slowly .. and we will just see what happens. Wish me luck.

      I had a sort of understanding with myself today. How long it will last is beyond me though. I come to the conclusion, that I don't want to die today. I don't like to cut either, but it gives me something I don't already have. The feeling of being alive. The feeling of pain that can be seen.   I still don't know how to figure out how to deal with all this damn pain. But somewhere between this stupid movie we watched at partial by some La Roche lady, and the information, aand just my mind thinking today.. I've figured it out. Also figured out why I don't get anxiety meds, em.. that is because.. most of the good ones are narcotic based..and addictive..   I don't think..  that would be a good thing for me..  heheh..     Well all this thinking made my brain hurt. I still think of the gun, but..  it doesn't feel as as good as a thought. Its hard though, when those thoughts go thru your head, whether you want them to or not. Its hard to even know how that feels unless you go thru it. Like, I couldn't ever imagine what it is like to hear voices, and I crack up everytime the doctor asks me that.. and.. well.. its scary for the people that experience it.  Well.. thats all folks...

      Still haven't found the Borderline Song I'm looking for....  pisses me off to no end, but found some others that jumped out at me.   Artist: Joni Mitchell  Album: Turbulent Indigo  Title: Borderline     Everybody looks so ill at ease So distrustful so displeased Running down the table I see a borderline Like a barbed wire fence Strung tight, strung tense Prickling with pretense A borderline  Why are you smirking at your friend? Is this to be the night when All well-wishing ends? All credibility revoked? Thin skin, thick jokes! Can we blame it on the smoke This borderline?  Every bristling shaft of pride Church or nation Team or tribe Every notion we subscribe to Is just a borderline Good or bad, we think we know As if thinking makes things so! All convictions grow along a borderline  Smug in your jaded expertise You scathe the wonder world  And you praise barbarity In this illusionary place-- This scared hard-edged rat race All liberty is laced with Borderlines  Every income, every age Every fashion-plated rage Every measure, every gauge Creates a borderline Every stone thrown through glass Every mean-streets-kick ass Every swan caught on the grass Will draw a borderline  You snipe so steady You snub so snide-- So ripe and ready To diminish and deride! You're so quick to condescend My opinionated friend All you deface, all you defend Is just a borderline Just a borderline ... Another borderline ... Just a borderline    Artist: Jane   Album: Close up and real   Title: Borderline     She hit the borderline The day she finally crossed the line and spoke Without the hope That had her choked till now  And swiftly to her head came All the comfort she’d been fed And she recalled just how she’d bled And how they’d watched her try  CHORUS: Don’t take me for a fool ‘Cos I know the world is cruel Don’t say it’s OK All the good has gone away  And innocence it was her fire For she believed that purity Was all that was required To live a better way  But there was for us No place to hide For that same day A child died Two boys were charged and questioned why But they could not reply  CHORUS  We fall and call and we carry it all Gathering on the way We reach and we teach and how we love to preach As long as our views can stay the same As long as they stay the same

      Not sure what to say.. or think or feel. Feeling really shitty. My blood pressure is up, and it never is. I almost panicked in the doctors office today. They said I had to see The Dr.. instead of Bonnie...  I almost cried...  Finally got in there, talked with Bonnie.. I did get to see her..I spoke up, and was, I don't feel comfortable speaking with the Dr.(he's a male) and I was going to talk about birth control.  I tried to wear long sleeves, but..  I have nothing clean so well, of course she saw my fresh cuts on my arms from last nite. She asked, I just tried not to cry. I hate my life. So much. All I've wanted to do for days and day is cry and cry.   Got in a big fight with C. last nite. About the fat joke...  he told me " break up with me then" and so I did. I haven't cried about it. I just wonder what he thinks and feels. And what happens from here. I feel like it was a sudden thing... I really wasn't going to, although I had thought of it, I just got so upset and pissed off, I didn't know what to do.

      What is it? WHy is it so aweful? Why does it hurt? Do all people really pretend they are happy? and if so... Why?   Life is fucked up, and I'm tired of being part of it. I wish it would all end. But.. without the gun, I find it impossible... so.. I'll just continue to cut, to help my stress level, until i'm so disfigured, noone will let me near them. They will lock me up in  a room and throw away the key.. and there I will live happily after fucking ever after.

      Finally a doctor agreed with me. I may not need medication for my depression. My depression is not..  a chemical imbalance.. its from my upbringing.  Well duh, I have Borderline Personality Disorder, and that is from the way I was brought up. Not learning to cope, not learning the emotional things I needed to develope. The Dr. didn't give me anythign for my anxiety, but he did start a mood stabilizer, Topomax, also a drug used for seizures. Hope it helps, one side effect of it is weight loss, and how could that be a bad thing.  I realize so much, I need to change my perception of life. I need to realize, although I wish I had a real family, it will never happen. My parents could never live up to my expectations, even if they wanted to. I always wanted to please them as a child. Now, I always wonder why. I've also realized, that as a child, I didn't realize these things that went on in my family were wrong. I feel stupid for that. I could of stopped alot of these things before they happened. But i guess I shouldn't keep saying.. If I would have....  that is the past.. I have to live for my future. I don't know what it is though. I don't know what I want it to be. I'm so confused on a daily basis. I can't make heads nor tails of anything in my life.  I've always wanted so much for my future. Always wanted things to be perfect. I know they can't be, but that doesn't stop me from wanting that.   If I had, everything I wanted, would my life be  so haunted?  Would I be scared, of going somewhere new? Would I always be crying? And feeling blue?  I ask myself this question, Almost every day, I also ask my God, and nothing he does say.  Am I all alone, In this dark and lonely world, Am I all alone, Answer this I say, I do not want to be alone, I do not  want to be alone.  Please save my life, and my soul, Please tell me where  I have to go.. So  that  I am  not  alone.

      Wishing I could get my comments to work. Still can't.  Mike, help me!!!  I put the code in right!??!? I think. THE stupid side bar thingy.. the code was in right for his web site although it wouldnt ever work for me. The other day, I just looked at the code, it looked right, and republished it. .. and it worked.. AMAZING.. blah blah blah..    Anyway...  I think too much. Had a lot of thinking I could do though today, as I drove like for 5 or 6 hours today. It wasn't too bad of a drive and I got to help my friend D. get home with her new Baby Emily.     So, I've come to the conclusion..  (at least my opinion today--I tend to be fickle lately) That.. I cannot marry a man that thinks I'm fat. Ok.. not a big deal to some... but I've never had an issue on whether a man finds me attractive. I've always felt pretty (though I am too chubby), and never had a bf tell me different. Sure the boys at school picked on me a bit, but I always had a smartass comeback,and it never bothered me that much. Maybe cuz I wouldn't be having sex with them or anything. I mean.. I don't want to be making love to my husband.. and not enjoying it, cuz all I can think of is him saying, "Julie, You are fat, lose some weight, she lost weight, so go write that down on how she did it". I said it once, I'll say it again.. FUCK YOU..  I said that to C. Apparently hurt his feelings, but hey..  It hurt mine.  One thing I dont tolerate well (other than lack of intelligence) is rudeness. Even said, trying to be funny, weight is not something you joke about to a woman. Especially a woman that has hormone problems.  I dunno, small issue, but has a big effect on me. I know some are thinking.. Jae.. you have self esteem issues, and I do, to an extent, because I'll never think i'm good enough.. (and damn I know I'm fat) but, do I need my future husband, telling me what to eat, or what not to, and how I should lose weight. I KNOW how to lose weight, i've done it before. But when its a challenge to not sleep your day away cuz you have nothing to look forward to, how do you get the motivation to work out an hour a day? and to eat healthy. Food is the only thing really enjoyable.    Haven't played my game in weeks, don't talk to many people online. When I am online, I don't really enjoy it, cuz if i'm not multitasking, I get bored easily.  And since I have dial up, I can't really do shit on my computer. The one things I enjoy lately are my two new friends, R. who chats with me on MSN (almost daily), and M. a friend of a friend, that emails me every day. Those are the two things I look forward to.   I want so much more. Not monetary.. or whatnot.. I just.. strive for more than this exsistance people call life. I wish I could understand my issues with God. I wish I could get over the fact that most people in my family don't love me or care, and that they will never change, no matter how much I pray that they could just love me and show me affection.   Its a sad life. A life without hope is hardly an existence. Life without hope is hell to me. Today I am partially glad I do have generalize anxiety disorder. I get scared going to new places by myself. Which prevents me from going to the gun shop and gettting a gun. Something any normal person, and even me could do, if I didn't have anxiety. So.. lately I've been thinking of asking (and hope to tommorrow) the Dr for some meds for my anxiety. I hate pills so I wonder deep down inside, that I think something will help, so I can take that trip to the gun shop. And that scares me. Without my anxiety, I'd be dead already. It saves me..but also prevents me from having a normal life. Its sooooo fucking scary.

      I cried as I read this  urlLink post . My friend has written this about me. I feel sad, not sure if is because I know this hurts my friends, or because I don't feel this way today.  Its hard for me to fathem, just a few days ago, I wanted to die, and today, other than being a little upset with my boyfriend, I'm ok. Not good, not bad, just living, breathing..    Still on my search, I  My search for self. What is self? what will I find? Who the Hell am I? I really don't know the answer to any of my questions, I hope that I can find them one day though.    As for hope for the future, I'm still searching for that. I've actually been getting some things  lately. Balanced the checkbook, made some calls. Have plans for next week.  BUt I got to get out of here, before I get emotional again. I'm on my way to Dubois to pick up Danielle and the baby.

      I sat here a few minutes ago, pulling the razor across my skin, it slowed my heartbeat, it slowed my breathing.. both which were rapid. I enjoy the feeling, as well as feel sick from it.  WHat the fuck am I doing to myself...    I find it sick, but strangely appealing at the same time.   What was going on. I felt depressed, angry.. and even a little suicidal.  Why? I feel like noone cares for me.. or even understands me. Everyone wants to think they understand me..  and I don't!! How can they understand me..better than I understand myself? I dont feel like they can.  I took Darian to a birthday party today. I had so much anxiety, and was so scared. I'd do anything for Darian though. I got thru it. I can still feel the fear in my stomach and chest though. I hate my emotions. I wish I could be numb. I wish they'd give me something to calm me down.   I think of suicide alot. Would I do again? ONly if I could get ahold of a gun. I'm serious.  Just a permanent solution to a temporary problem.. the critics, and professionals would say. How long is a problem temporary. I've had these problems my whole life. They don't feel temporary to me. And I have BPD, that is not temporary, I'll have that label my whole FUCKING life. Why? because I fear abandonment, because I've been abandoned by my family many many times....    because I cut, and I don't know how to stop. Because I have relationship issues.. and cant' seem to meet anyone nice....  I hate my life, but can't figure out where the tools are to change it. What do I do? I do not know. I feel so scared, scared of myself mostly.. I feel so alone..   Please... make it go away

      Just surfing the web tonite..  looking at things..  like...   urlLink The Straight Dope Archive , a book of writing called the  urlLink Talmud  which is something I had never heard of. From the link I got from another site, it talks of Jesus's real father..  but have yet to get a chance to read much about it. As it is waaay past 11 and I am very sleepy. I drove to Dubois today..  and it was a long journey..  mostly cuz everyone had to stop here and there and here and there before we left.  Also wandering the net.. checking my email.. and chatting with my friend S. from Wichita. She and her family are doing great!! oh.. and then took a quiz on what country I was.         You're Turkey!      You have a good deal of history behind you, both good and    bad, but through it all, you've become a leader among your friends. &nbsp;You    have an uncanny ability to make friends with people who hate each other, though    sometimes you just hate them instead. &nbsp;Surprisingly fickle, you keep a    good balance in your life between religion and humanism, but most people think    you're fanatical anyway. &nbsp;You're Istanbul, you're  Constantinople.   Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the  href="http://bluepyramid.org">Blue Pyramid

      Anyway.. was doing some research on Euthansia for my sister, S. and ran across a cool  urlLink essay .  Also got to see that they are having some cool concerts at Darien Lake this summer. Hope I get to go to some. I've been lucky lately.. as I've had a few wonderful friends always keeping in touch with me. It keeps the smile on my face.... and makes my life less depressing.  My gram.. says she knows.. that I stole the money from her. ((( I KNOW MY SISTER DID IT))) it pisses me off to no end. I would never steal from my grandmother!! ever!!! She thinks I'm evil. Says I cut myself and tried to commit suicide for attention!! WHAT THE FUCK!?!?!?!? She says I wouldn't even cry when she died. I would.. alot. As much as she pisses me off.. I would cry.  I hate that I even say mean stuff to her.. and swear at her..but I don't know what to do. SHe just thinks I'm the worse person in the world. SHe still harasses Darian and pisses her off. She belittles me every chance I get. Saying, I'm not doing anything to get better. SHe thinks I should just snap out of it.   I'm still debating going to stay with my mother for a bit. I don't like the smoking honestly, and am not sure if I can deal with my mom's demands.. DO this.. DO that.. blah blah blah.. she is too lazy... and then uses her arm as a bigger excuse.. I think she learned she can't do this at Christmas when everyone harassed her.  I don't know.. still a thought on my mind.  Still haven't talked to C. much..  but had a little time this morning. Things are going ok. Still have no idea what will go on in our future. He says he will reapply in two months time.   No thoughts of suicide.. or cutting today. Feelings of sadness were overwhelming when i was fighting with my gramma though.  I worked out today.. Stretching for ten minutes..  run/walking for 22...   and did the stairs a few times.. :) much more active today.

      Running thru my head. Not sure whether to be sad.. or happy.. that I'm feeling good today. I thought for sure I would go off the edge..  ( i was hanging there as it was) when I found out C. did not get his Visa. Dissappointing yes... but maybe it wasn't our time to be together... (apparently).  Maybe I needed this extra time to work on me, and my goals, and get myself together. I don't want to feel depressed, like I have been the last week or so. I felt so out of control. I've been able to make some good friends in the last week. They have helped me alot. I hope they know who they are :) !!     Last nite, before I went to sleep, I thought of cutting, I thought of suicide... and it was great to wake up and feel totally different.  It feels wonderful. Wish I could figure out how to feel this way..  at least 50% of the time.. I'd be all set.   Want to share a poem with you all..  Death  With this I could not stay I'm sorry it had to be this day.  The 13th of January 2004, It is the last day, I'm never more.  Too much sadness, Too much hate, This is the day, You learn my fate.  Forgive Please, I did not mean to hurt you Forgive me please, I have no virtue.  Only want to end this pain, Maybe for another to gain.  I felt really bad last nite, that is all I can really say. I thought maybe I would attempt suicide again. I wrote to my friend, Punky about my thoughts and feelings, and it will probably drive him crazy when he reads it, knowing he can't do a damn thing to help me. He has, though. Writing to him, gives me a change to be heard. Something that I'm not used to. It feels good to have someone I can open up to, and never be scared what I say will hurt him. Because I know, even if it hurts him, he will forgive me.. because I know he loves and cares for me so. I think the sad part of his life, is that noone knows what a good heart he has, but me. I wish I could of done something to help him before he got himself in trouble... I guess I just need to learn, that people need to learn their life lessons on their own, no matter what you say or show them. Thing is.. I never really said anything.. I guess at one point, I may have been scared. But..  that is in the past. I need to work on the future, and decide what it will be like. What do I really want. What will make me happy.    What would make me really happy right now..  is to cuddle up in my boyfriends arms.. and go to sleep. I'm getting really tired.. so I'm off. :)

       Well. I find out... in about 5 hours if C. gets his visa. Could be a good thing, could be a bad thing. Who knows. I don't have much emotion about it just yet. Just been on edge the last few days. It sucks like hell. I wish I could curl in a ball, and dissappear from the earth. I feel so much sadness and despair in my life. Does everyone really think that I chose this? My family seems to. They think I chose to be depressed. I choose to let my anxiety get the best of me. They I like fearing to go outside... to meet strangers. That I fear going to the store alone. THat I fear the looks people give me. I fear to say something wrong. I fear everyone hates me. I fear I could be raped. I fear my daughter could be molested. I feel so stressed. Would anyone really choose this? I know I certainly would not. I have not. I wish I could just life over, knowing the things I know now, but not having to experience them. Oh well. Life is not fair. The rich keep getting richer, and the poor poorer. Not because the poor don't want better, but because they don't know how to work the system.  Its not..  who you are, it is who you know. :)    Well.. wish me luck.. and if you don't hear from me.. I'm either extremely happy or in the looney bin..  :)  Funny thing, Don't you see, Funny thing,  This thing called me.  I've lived my life, through all the hell. I've lived my life, with my story to tell.  It's not that bad, I've seen worse, I could be dead, taken away in a hearse.  Now I lay me down to sleep Close your eyes, don't make a peep.  Life would be better,  if you would only sleep..  Sleep it off,  Drift away, Close your eyes baby, It's okay.

       Partial..  doesn't really help much anymore. I'm not into it. That and I don't feel I get the attention I need. Waaa Waa.. I know.. I act like a baby, but..  I just hate spending all this time, and not getting anything out of it. Not that I don't get anything out of it.. I do get a bit, but  I don't quite feel like I'm heard. I mean, they want me to take meds, they don't force me, but know that I'm a "good" girl... and I DON'T WANT TO TAKE THEM. The only other person in the group that doesn't take them, that doesn't want to is court ordered. They don't force me to, but when I asked could I get off them, I was told, I should give it at least 6 months to see if it makes a difference. Been on it for two months or so, so four more months to go. . I think. I think I'm so anxious, I'm confusing myself.   That is another thing that upsets me..  Why don't they give me anything for my anxiety...????   I have more anxiety than anyone i know. Do i just hide it well. ?? I'm so used to not supposed to be having feelings.. I don't really show them. J is just always "OKAY" .  Okay to me.. is living breathing.. nothing more. Its not a true life.  I don't know much.  (that is a lie, I know alot..) but anyway..      One thing i know for sure, is that I want a better life..   a real life. I want to be happy. Happy people, don't expect everything to be perfect!! ( I don't.. never have.. never will)  Happy people are optimistic. How can I be optimistic and realistic.. at the same time. I can't figure it out. Being optimistic, makes me feel like I'm living in a dream world. I don't like that. I don't like dissappointment... but.. what does that matter? really? I've not experienced..much but that..    (pessimistic)... NO.. i say.. I am just realistic.. I expect the worse.. so if something good happens.. it is a surprise.   Not sure I want to write this here.. as C. reads it...  but..  I'm expecting him not to get the visa. That way...  I won't be as dissappointed when he doesnt.. or i'll be happy when he does. Believe you me.. I want him to get the visa...    This is what I expect.. to happen..actually.. in my mind..  He won't get the visa. I'm too scared to go over there... right now.. (too much anxiety & not enough money).  So eventually..  I'll get bored, or upset, and break up with him..  (just like he thinks I will). And I will be sad and depressed, and maybe even suicidal again.  But then I'll meet another guy over here.. (in the US) and he will be just as bad as the other guys..  I've met..  and it will take me a while to realize it..  and then I'll just be fucked up again.. and the cycle will continue..  until I die.. or get pregnant..    Either way..      Life goes on.   I know my pessimistic attitude gets in the way of my happiness. But how can I find my happiness, when the only thing I've really found that makes me happy (besides my PC) is making other people happy. How is this a good goal in life? My happiness depends on others and it shouldn't. I should find some happiness in myself. I don't know how. I will never be good enough for myself. I'll never live up to my high expectations.  I want my Doctorate for God's sake.   ME, Julie.. a girl from a poor home, where.. only a few .. (less than 6) have went to college.. and even fewer have graduated from it. Most of my family members have their FUCKING GED for GOD's sake. AND they are proud of it. WHAT the HELL?  Sure... I graduated from High School with Honors.. (don't know how I pulled that off) I didn't always have the best of grades..  Almost failed Biology..  and 11th grade History. I had D's and F's in those classes. I remember those times well. I remember all the crying I did..  because I didn't study hard enough.     What makes me think I can get my doctorate.... I know I can do anything if I try hard enough... but right now.. I don't even have a job..  I can't even get my resume in order.. and it took me two months to get the energy to balance my checkbook.  I barely get out of bed in the morning.. if it wasn't for my daughter.. I probably wouldnt.    What the hell am i going on and on about..  Hell if I know.. I'm shutting up.. i'm just rambling, like the thoughts in my head...    Life goes on.. Tommorrow will be a better day.. Maybe tommorrow, They sky won't be gray.  We can only hope, We can only pray, That tommorrow, Will be a better day.  Life goes on, That is all I will say, Tommorrow will be a better day.

      Did you find true love? Did she fall from the sky? When God sent her down,  Did he know she’d want  To die?  With good intentions, I hope that he didn’t With all your love, I would think that she wouldn’t  You never know what life  Will bring, Do you think the wedding bells Will ever ring?  I hope they do, For you deserve the best, Give her your love, And God will do the rest.  We will keep you in our prayers, We want to see your dreams, Come true, Yet is seems they never do.

      Been wanting to Blog for a while now... just  haven't got around to it. Been too depressed, and too.. busy.. I suppose. Or maybe I just didn't really want people knowing what is going on with me..    This is my first post of the new year.  Well, I have been pretty depressed, and right now, worrying so much, about the 13th. Tuesday, this is the day that we find out ..  (at 4am EST) whether my fiance, C. gets his visa. If he doesn't, we have to have a plan  B. I'm not sure I'm up for plan B right now. I know many of my friends and family are praying for us. I know I am hoping and praying too. It will be a big day for both of us, and emotional.. too... either way it goes... I'm sure..  I will need my many friends around.   I have to promise to myself....  I will not seclude myself that day... I will try to avoid sharp items that could be used as weapons... I will try to share my feelings..  As for my New Years Goals..  (life long goals, not resolutions) I plan to lose weight.  My first step into that, is to cut out soda, and drink more water, and to start to exercise more. After I do that, I plan to...  exercise more, and watch my other sweets..  and eat healthier snacks. (carrots, celery, peanuts, instead of candy.. and whatnot)  Then...  I hope to try and learn more about myself, which I have been doing this past year, but I want to go in depth more....    And.. I want to read and write more..  (even here).  Well.. anyway.. not much new. I've attended partial twice this week. Hasn't helped much, but it gets me out of the house and around people. Hoping to see the Dr R. tommorrow.. sort of..  I know he will want to push more meds. I HATE THEM.  Went to see Dr. A. today, the allergist, pretty much a waste of my time, but I made my dental appointment, as it was in the same building.  Dr. A. just looked in my ears, and in my nose.. and said.. lets get you an auditory test.. and i'll see you back in two weeks. The receptionist doesn't think my insurance covers the auditory test, so...  they will let me know when i come back. They want to see if the singular (not sure the spelling) its an allergy medicine is working, and to give it two more weeks.. blah blah. I don't like Dr's much.  Any.. last nite was great..  stayed online all nite chatting with some nice people. It was nice to have the chance to spend time with some nice people. Its not often I get a chance to do that. Some people I meet always have other motives.   Also found out today that my daughter's aunt died. She was quite young..  not even near 40 I don't think. Her pacemaker died. She was a weird, but nice lady. I don't think it has quite hit me yet. I worry about her kids though. They are teens, but I know this will be hard on them.   Well, I'm off to read email, and then get some rest. :)

       So far everyone I've talked to thinks its ok that I explore my sexuality. I'm glad that's cool with them, but I'd explore it anyway... Since I'm finally open to the idea... or rather I finally found someone else open to the idea.  Though the one person, I'm really attracted to, I really can't open the idea up to. It's rather scary. I don't even know how she would react or say or think or.. anything. I wouldn't want anything in our friendship to change, so I think I'd rather not change anything.   But as for the men in my life..  First I want to thank Michel..     ( I LOVE HIM.. heheh) he fixed my blog comments... so comment away folks..  and tell me that I'm fucking crazy!!   But.. really, about M. and C. I don't know if my decisions were good ones, but i'm trying to ride them out. I gave up my emotional support for something more physically with a little emotional support. Is that wrong. Whose to say. M. makes me feel good none the same, but he's not commited to me like C. was, and I know I shouldn't compare, but I don't like that. Commitment is important to me, I just don't know how commited he is to me. I know that I am always the more commited one in the relationship and I'm used to that, but I've never been in a relationship like this one.  He told me it was ok if I had sex with his best friend, because I found him attractive. I was floored, and well still am. I can't figure him out. I don't think men were ment to be figured out though. Oh well.   I wish I could figure out my emotions, as much as I think I'm scared to settle down and get married, that is what I've always wanted, and well, even if I was with M. for like 25 years, I could never see that happening, before he said a word about his feelings on marriage.. I said to Lisa, he's not the marrying type.. and oh.. was I so right. Was I wrong to trade what I had with C. for what I have for M? But.. was what I had for C... even real?  I was emotional connected to him on a high level though, the thing is, when I play my games.. ( I don't purposely try to play them, I do it sometimes without realizing it) he plays them back and we end up fighting.  With M. he just lets me. .. and ends up being brutally honest, and well I usually am able to tell him.. what I wanted to tell him in the first place. With C. and I .. its just a pushing struggle, we both have emotional problems.. and don't ever know what to do.   Harder.. than how I was feeling about the breakup between me and C. is how my daughter was taking it. Her and C were close. Though only on webcam and chat, they talked and typed.. and webcam chatted.. she seemed to really adore him. and was glad I was going to marry him. She really wants a brother or sister. And although M. might like her, I don't see them ever having the connection that C and Darian share. It makes me sad, because I feel like I've broke her little heart.   Looking forward to seeing Shannon this weekend. Hope I get some time to hang out with her. :) I never get enough time. Hopefully my car will be fixed soon. Who knows.

      Surely.. or not really.  Who knows. All I know, is that I'm an emotional mess. I don't know what I'm doing, or if what I have done is right, or if what I want to do is right. I still think of C. almost every day. I miss our daily chats, (not the fights), and that is something M. just doesn't fulfill. He's not there for me on a daily basis. Rarely on a weekly basis. I am beginning to like the relationship between me and M, better when it was friends, he emailed me daily, and made time for me often. I don't feel like he has the time for me now.  Then again, when I think of it, I feel like I always ask too much of the other person when I'm in a relationship, and that bothers me. Why do I always feel like that, why do my needs not matter, why am I so needy. I don't get it. I wish I did.  I just don't know where I'm going, and although, I'm enjoying myself, I'm not sure I'm making the best choices in my life.  Who knows, only time will tell. I know I do need something more though...  I'm in the search for it though.  Realized, I'm out of my one med, not anything I can really do, kind of glad, its the depression med. Still on the moods stabilizer. Good thing. I haven't had as many of my rages lately. Looking forward to going to the gym tommorrow. Finally getting some bills paid, and getting a few things done. I have to quit procrastinating.   One other thing I've been exploring is my sexuality. I have a tendency to believe that I may be a little more than bi-curious. Not sure if this is a surprise to anyone. I'm not sure really what to  make of it. I want to experiment, and now I am free to do so, I'm just not sure how this will effect my life. I can't ever see myself in a serious lesbian relationship, mostly because that is not the way you should raise children, but I always wonder how other people view this situation.

      In my closet in my head...      um..  just too much stuff going on in my  head.  I am thinking too many thoughts about the relationship between me and M. Too many things about the future, and what allready has happened. Both good and bad. I wonder where this is leading, and know that it is going nowhere, and wonder why I want to just see where it goes. Then I wonder why I say this to myself, and wonder if he will read this, and if he does, what will he say or not say. I wonder how he really feels about me, and whether he likes to spend time with me. I wonder why he's attracted to me, I wonder why he agreed to date me, or why he even wants to date in the first place. I always well, my goal in dating was always to get married, until now, and now, I don't know what to do with myself. Just kind of sit back and watch what happens. Enjoy the relationship, while it lasts.  The thing is, he doesn't seem to mind if we have alone time, and I think that bothers me. Don't most guys want to get their girlfriends alone, so they can have their way with them? I just find some of the ways he is strange, and can't quite figure it out. I wonder if I'll ever figure out what it is I really need in a relationship, or if I'll ever find my true love, if that even exists.  I feel like M. is more up for a more open relationship, or isn't ready for a commitment, but don't understand, why I felt obligated to dump C. I don't understand why M and I spend more time with his friends than we do alone.  I enjoy his friends alot, they are great, but..   I want to spend time with M, while I have the chance to be alone, because soon, we wont have a chance in hell to be alone. Because he lives with his parents and I live with my gram. I guess, maybe.. I feel cheated because, maybe on an importance level, he is more important to me, in my life, than I am in his. I can't say for sure, because I can't read his mind, but that is how I feel.  Maybe that goes back to the whole thing, him saying that he is selfish, maybe he was right, and he is.. who knows, its not for me to say or to judge. I just know, that I felt more important in his life, when we were just "friends". If that is saying much.  That isn't exactly right either, he's been there for me alot, its just frustrating.. ..     Anyway...  dropped another pound, went to the gym today, first time in over a week, felt good, but I'm exhausted, can't wait to go to the gym. Even ate less than 1, 000 calories today, and am stuffed!! whoo hooo.  ( THanks LISA)  I've had a pretty good day, had too many mood swings though. Wish they would stop swinging. Well, I'm off.

      Everything seems to be going ok. Moods are still swinging. I felt really suicidal on Thursday, even went as far as writing a suicide note. The sad thing is, both my mother and grandmother told me to do it. The one thing that stopped me was the fact that my daughter, well my aunt and I don't have the papers drawn up for my aunt to take my daughter. In a month when she comes up, that will be done. I hope that I don't feel suicidal then. I have spent the weekend with M. and his friends, and that has kept me busy, it actually keeps my mind off all the stupid things in my life and is rather enjoyable. They are really fun. It is nice to spent time away, and not have to worry about Darian also. I was moving in with my mother, but she pretty much kicked me out already, so I'm going back with my gram. Its ok, I'll suivive, I just hope she doesn't give me too hard of a time about the whole M. thing, because I still want to spend time with him. I didn't want to spend time  in the hospital, nor with my grandma or mom, I would of felt even more suicidal. I feel safe around him. It's nice to feel safe. I feel like I've known his friends forever and can kid and joke with them, just like they have been my friends forever.  I'm looking forward to seeing Shannon next weekend. :) I miss her so much. I have to get her present ready from Christmas time. We will see if I get that done. Will try to post more later, actually in the middle of a game with the boys..   :)

      Lots of new things on my end.. too much to post.  I went away for the weekend with my "friend" M. and had a blast, we are now dating. I completely broke things off with C. That was hard, but it had to be done. I have to start figuring out what all that I want and need, and start fulfilling those needs. My relationship with C. wasn't fulfilling that. He helped me thru alot in this past year, and I will always remember that.    The big thing that is on my mind though, is parenting, how some people chose and some don't. Well I didn't.  I did choose to keep my daughter however, and the first few years, were hard, but I loved her so much, and now..  I just don't feel that I'm good for her anymore and I don't know what to do. I am really getting tired of people telling me that I'm a good mother, and what would she do without me. I'm not saying I don't want to be part of her life, I'm just saying, I'm not doing good, being her soul support.  I'm always crabby with her, for the last year, I loose my patience so easily with her, and I just see our relationship getting worse and worse. I mean, well for example... Probably in the last year.. I can count on my hands the number of times that I have bathed her by myself, that is just one of those things that I either forget, or just don't take the time to do, or something.. I really don't know what it is. I gave her a bath last week, but before that.. I really haven't . I only gave her a bath then, because she had peed all over. My gram usually gives her a bath here, before that, I always asked Wil to make sure she got a bath. Sure... I always make sure she's dressed, and gets to school.. and stuff like that, but is it enough? I don't think so. I feel like I will never get where I need to be, I will never be able to provide for her like I need to if I can't get away from her. I hate saying this, but in reality, I really in a way.. want to get rid of her. Not in the sense some people think. My aunt would take care of her for me, I know this, and it would be ideal. But would it be fair. WOuld it be fair for anyone involved. Would it make things better? or worse? I dunno, I'm so confused.. and noone seems to listen to me when I say I can't handle parenting anymore..    They just don't get it. I feel like noone understands. Maybe because I don't understand. I don't understand, how...  I can go from never wanting to be away from my baby, to hardly being able to stand being around her. And its not because she's a bad.. girl.. She is .. and always has been a good girl.. she's so perfect..  so loving..  so beautiful.  I just don't want to mess her up, and I see it happening already. I hate myself for it. I just want to make her life better. And I can't do that the way I am now. I just can't.

      I had a nice long talk with C. today. Wasn't supposed to have that tommorrow. He wants me to come to Romania. I'm scared. I can't say that I'm not. I'm frightened, but not for any real reason, just for the anxieties in my head. I told him more details about me and M.  He said no matter what he'd always be there. I'd like to believe that, but I'm scared. As much as I like M. I feel he is not the one for me. It feels so good to have his attention, and to feel his warmth, he pays so much attention to me, something I've not had in a long time.  I don't want to be alone right now. Right before I started talking to M. I was planning my death again. I didn't really tell this to anyone. Why would I. I really wanted to die. I was going to get a gun. I was getting over my anxieties. I was going to buy the gun when I got my tax money back. I realized, not because of M. or because of C. but because of some other events that happened.... that I do want to live, but I have a lot of things to figure out.  But without people like M. and my other friend R. to talk to me, and flirt with me, and soothe me..   I don't think I would of lasted long... I was going down hill, really fast. Really really fast.   Now, I'm losing weight.. I smile and laugh more. I'm trying to enjoy working out, and I'm trying to make plans for the future.  I'm hoping things will change for the better, I just have to try and be more optimistic.  But then, I still have problems, what to do with M., what to do with C... or do I just sit back, and see what happens. Let fate take its toll.   I dunno, have to talk to M.  I wrote him a long email tonite, we will see what he says.. .    Other than that...  been.. over 36 hours, since I've had caffeine or soda!! Hooray!! and I'm down another pound.    I'm beginning to think, maybe some of my anxieties about going to Romania.. has to do with my weight... maybe..  (no. probably) I make such a big deal about it with C. cuz I'm not happy with it.. but..  who knows..

      My life I find it more confuseing day by day. I've been enjoying it more though. I've been spending time with a new friend, M., who is very kind and gentle.  The thing is... I still love, C., my ex fiance, I still hold him deep in my heart. He's been there thru so much for me. Although none of it physical, that is what I've been needed and craving for many months now. I've found what I've been needing in M.  I find this hard, because although I want to satisfy my own needs, I don't want anyone else to be hurt. I've not felt suicidal for almost a week now, it is such a relief. I've not cut for almost two weeks. The cuts are almost all healed.   I do feel such turmoil inside. Do I wait forever, in hopes that C. and I may be together, and what about all this fighting we've been doing. ANd all my issues with him thinking I'm fat. I usually don't have self confidence issues around men. I know that men find me attractive, and I don't usually feel fat around them. I've not had men that tell me they love me.. tell me that I'm fat.  I just don't get it. I guess part of it.. is that I'm very high maintenence. I enjoy alot of attention. I'm very emotional. I'm very needy. Is this because I'm borderline or just because I'm Julie.   Who is Julie? I'm starting to figure that out.    Julie??  Julie Ann Lathrop..  Born February 15th 1979, Port Allegany PA...  Is almost 25 years old Likes-Basketball, Drawing, Sketching, Basketball, Playing Computer Games, Chatting, Porn.. heheh (YES i said Porn..  I do enjoy it.. I admit.. Of both men and women), Dirty Jokes, Clean Jokes, Poetry, Reading, Driving, Dreaming, Talking, Kissing,  Favorite Colors- Purple ( then.. Purple w/ Pink and Blue) and Black Favorite Food- Pizza w/ lots of Cheese Favorite Cartoon- Smurfs Favorite Item- Harley Blanket  I've realized, I do have an identity... though, sometimes I realize I don't. When I'm with people. I tend to like to do the things they are doing. Is there anything wrong with that? Do I give up who I am to do that? I don't think I am. Borderline Personality Disorder says I do. I don't get it. I just find I am an easy going person, that enjoys many things.   Back to the men..thing..  am I being selfish.. or just stupid.. I don't know. I don't know what it is I really want. I thought I did. I do know, I need this thing, whatever it is, between me and Mike, I like it. Its enjoyable.  I do know I love C. with all my heart. As for my feelings for M. I don't know him well enough yet. I enjoy his company, and I am very attracted to him. I plan on spending as much time with him as I am able, because I feel this is something I need. For once, I don't feel pressure by a man, to please him.. or anything like that. I get enjoyment out of his company. I feels wonderful.

      Not sure what to say or where to begin. I've already been feeling really down.. and well. ... This guy I like.. well more than like, whose been part of my life for over 3 years, told me that he didn't think of me as any more than a friend. Hearing those words was hard. Part of my heart hurts.  I knew that nothing would ever become of it anyway because of our lives, but hearing him say that. It took him a while too, I asked him 2 days ago, how he felt about me. He told me today.  I know part of why he didn't want to tell me. I'm sure he thinks I'm so fragile, and I'd react badly.  I'm not going to slit my wrists or anything, but I have tears I'm trying to hold back until I go to bed, so I can be alone with my thoughts. I've been so anxious and depressed lately. I just want to know someone loves me. I think that is my problem.   I can't think of any more to say, feeling so hurt.

      Fuck. Its me. I look in the mirror, and I see..  This scared little girl, Thats me.  Who is she? What does she want to be? Who is she? Is she really me?  How can I be sure? How do I know if i'm real? I hate this,  but this is the way that I feel.  I'm hurting,  and dying inside, I'm hurting,  and  my feelings I do hide.  I hide them from myself, I'll hide them from you. I want to share them, but not sure how to.

       I guess one of the easiest ways to pass on some good information is my blog. If anyone has time... I hope they take the time to read  urlLink this.     It's an article about cutting.  When i read it, I felt like it could explain cutting a little better than I could.  I feel like it is a great article, but,  it did trigger me a bit. This is the first time, I've really read anything that was a trigger.  Probably because I'm already moody about alot of things going on in my life.. and this just added to it.  I find it so hard that noone can truely understand me. I know so people that actually wish that they could. Its so hard, because I don't even understand me.  I feel like I'm really messed up right now.  I hate that feeling. I just want to go back to feeling ok again, mentally, emotionally .. .. and physically.

      Well, from what the test said yesterday. I'm not pregnant. I'll know all the official results in two weeks. Also got the Hep B vaccine, which is a good thing.  Stupid me also burnt my foot on the heater yesterday. OUCH.. it hurts..    but.. anyway..   as soon as I got out of the clinic.. and J. got home. . he called me.   I can't figure him out. We break up, and now he wants to see me again.  I heard some stuff today, from my aunt, about his sister, and his mom.. and well..  its no wonder, his family is about as fucked up as mine..  (if not worse).  Just makes me wonder... cuz I can't figure him out.   Cuz after the other nite .. when I confronted him.. about even wanting to be in a relationship with me..   I just felt better about the whole thing cuz it was over.    Anyway..  not sure what to think about life right now. I'm trying to keep a positive attitude. I started to update my resume, that went well. Have almost all the info I need, but need to really update my references.  Trying to decide who to keep on there and who to change, as I haven't even communicated with the people on there for years.  Asked my aunt to pick me up an application from Adelphia.  She said she would try..    we will see. If not, I'll just have to go over there sometime.   Debating, talking to Tops, about my job back. .. debating where I want to move..  what I want to do.  Not sure I want to stay around here.. but not sure I want to leave all by myself either. Have to get my whole car situation figured out first.  We will see.    Not much else to say for now.  I look into the sky and what do I see. I see my life looking  back at me.  Reality, or dreams come true, somehow,  they rarely do.  I'm looking down on  my life. Trying not to think,  about the knife.  Hard to do,  but I can... I know it.. Its easier than...  I think.

      I'm a fucked up mess. I'm going crazy. I've been on a high for a few weeks now, and well.. now its dropping. Maybe cuz of lack of going to the gym, or that my pretending is just getting to me. Do I pretend, or did those things.. not bother me. Do i pretend they don't bother me? Who knows. I don't anymore. I have no idea who I am. Or why I am.. or what..   I've been on such a good high..  feeling soo good... and today..    I'm crying.. and want to curl in a ball.. and die. All I can think about is that pregnancy test on Thursday.  And what if.. and if I am.. what am I doing to my baby now, not letting the Doctor know I mite be pregnant and I'm on all these meds. I'm such a fuck up. Maybe I'm not, but I feel like it right now. I just want to know.. that I'm not pregnant.. and then be able to move on , and make some choices from there. I don't know if being with J. is even good for me. I feel like no matter what , no relationship will ever satisfy me...    because they never care what I want or need.  I mean.. all I want is some love and compassion. I want to be listened to. I feel like I give much in return. I am very loving. I would give you the world if I could. I would give you my anything...  and all I want to know is that you love me.. and are honest and faithful to me. That is too much to ask....    for some people. Just I don't understand, why these two particular men could give me the attention I wanted before we dated, but then when I start dating them, its like I'm no longer of importance. Is this my ..thing.. or theirs..  I mean.. are they really paying less attention? or do I expect more attention? I'm not sure.  I just don't get it. I just want them to follow thru. Call me..  when you say you will call, email when you say you will email. Call me and see how I'm doing...  DON'T YOU CARE?  I've been so sick lately.. and I feel like noone even.. notices...   I hate it.. i wish I'd just stop breathing sometimes.  Its scary cuz I feel like with this asthma, that I will just stop breathing.. and noone will notice.. and I can see myself in the coffin..   and..    its so unreal.        I just don't know what to tell myself to feel better. Maybe just to be single again, and not have any expectations..   cuz the expectations I have of myself are too much already, I shouldn't expect anyone else to live up to them. I just wish I didn't want so much.. but then I don't feel like I'm asking for so much. I mean...  I'm used to seeing my bf almost everyday.. or talking to him.. and I hardly see mine. Its stupid. I want more time. I want more everything. I will never be happy. I shouldn't say that. CUZ.... I Will be HAPPY one day. I will be..  I cried as I wrote that. Right now.. it feels so off, but I remember feeling yesterday, as if I was happier than I had been in a while, despite all that was going on.    I hate being borderline. I forget the feelings I felt. I forgot..    everything. I forget my own happiness even if it was five minutes ago.  It makes me sick that I can be so fucked up, but then.. I feel sooo NORMAL ( (i hate that word) sometimes....  I mean.. I could pass for a normal person.    .. but.. what is normal?  I dunno..    I just want to curl up.. in a ball.. and have someone that loves me.. put their arms around me and tell me it will be alright.. and gentle stroke my hair.. until i fall asleep.. and I feel their lips.. gently touch my forehead.. as they tuck me in bed..           I just want to feel loved, and wanted, and needed.   I need to be needed. It is what makes me happy.

      Emotions rampage I feel like I'm in a cage all alone, nowhere to roam.  No freedom,  No food,  No fear,  No face....  Nothing to see, nowhere to be, But in this cage, alone.  Anywhere but here, I'd rather fear, this cage,  than open space.

      I'm such a bad blogger... least I've been keeping busy..  Great THING!!   I did blog last week, but then, got a phone call and had to go offline.. and lost what I wrote. STupid me.. tried hitting post and publish when offline.. and grrr.. it dissappeared..  so.. I guess... I have alot of updating to do, so.. years down the road when I read this, I can remember..what the hell i was going thru at this point in my life.   So... M. and I dated.. for a little while later, things just started getting, where I wasn't happy, partly cuz I knew there was no real future involved for us ( I know, too much too soon) but when I get with someone, I want to know that potential is there, marriage, kids.. and with M. I knew it would never be.  He's a great guy, but we parted on good terms, and are still friends and all that good stuff. He's still my sweetie. :)  He's been there for me still even after we broke up. It hurt more than I thought it would, but I'm pretty much ok with it. Partly because while M. and I were seeing each other, his friend started paying attention to me..  and well things sort of happened that shouldn't have.  M. considers that we were in an open relationship..   so it didn't bother him..  on my end, but I still think of my reasoning.. behind it.. and can't really justify it.  But.. so J, the friend.. and I started spending time together...  though he had a gf that lived out of town (in Ohio)..  and.. then M. and I broke up, and agreed to be friends..   and J's gf broke up with him..   and now J and I are dating. That has only been a few days, though.  Since Saturday.    Though since Saturday, I feel he's not been too good of a bf, but..  time will always tell.  Shit happens right. I've been really busy, so I haven't dwelled on it, like I did with M.  I made M. .. or tried to make him the center of my life, and that is the last thing he wanted in the world.  Communication..  well.. is one of my troubles..and I have a hard time.. really opening up to J.   I am just annoyed.. right now..cuz i wanted to talk to him.. on Sat morning.. and asked him to not go to bed.. and he just went to bed.. without..   talking to me first..   Then.. last nite.. I was in Bradford late. . so I thought I'd stop and see him.. and couldnt get ahold of him..    and he never called me like he said he would..  blah men.   Oh well. I've been busy, with the gym.. and doctors.     DOCTORS... Dare and I have been sick. She had pneonemia, she's fully recovered, and just went to the Dr last nite, and has a slight head cold. You wouldn't know the girl was in the hospital, she even gained 2lbs !!  She's such a riot.  Me, on the other hand, I've been to the ER twice, and the DR.. once..and going again here in a few minutes..   they say... "bronchiiis, no.. ur asthma. " I'm on steriods, that kill my stomache.. and inhalers..  and..  my allergie meds.. and a decongestant.. and etc..   I HATE IT.       SPeaking of meds.  I ran out of LExapro a few weeks.. or a month ago or something, havent noticed anything from that. Well, ran out of the Topamax yesterday, so we will see if it did anything for my mood. I'd rather not be on it. I will try to go to partial on Thursday, depends on what Sally is doing. (my aunt is coming up TODAY..  YEAH!!!.. i miss her)  and let them know about the meds and stuff. I haven't been to therapy.   Overall, I think I'm doing ok. I had my middle of the month episode. I think you should just put in me in a straight jacket from around the 13th of the month to the 19th or so. I've noticed a pattern in my SI (self injure, and suicidal) tendicies.  I've not been sleeping much. I went to bed after midnite last nite.. and was up at 7:30 this morning. I feel good to go. This could be because of many things. My going to the gym and losing weight, being sick, I blame mania...  (who knows--never been diagnosed bipolar..but .... )   or..  i've even though.. of .. what is that SADD..  the seasonal disorder..where because of the lighting and the sun. I notice now, when i wake up in the AM, because the sun is up, I smile, because it feels good, to see the sun, rather than the dark when getting up. The weather, though a little dreary, is getting soooo much better.  Its very nice to see.   Well hoping to find more time for my blog. It is one of the best therapies.. for both myself and for my friends to help me thru the tough times. If I keep things bottled up inside..  that is when I explode. I don't want to explode anymore. I just want to be happy, and to live my life, the way it needs to be lived. I want to do something with it.  Wish me luck.

      I don't want to retype it, so I'm just going to cut and paste what I wrote to my group earlier. I'm really disturbed by this... and if anyone has any ideas on how to help me with this.. please do. :)   Hello all,   HOpe everyone is safe, and know that I am too. I'm so upset today. I want to say I'm doing better than I have been. I found myself even giving myself a positive pep talk today, even without trying. I couldn't believe it. I'm usually so negative. I had my first Panic attack today, and I'm not even sure it can really be called so. I had it in a dream. I'm still so freaked out about it, and don't know what to do. I have anxiety about using my bf's bathroom now, luckily it happened at his house.. but still, its really hard.  In the dream, I go into the bathroom, and I'm standing there in my pajamas, and my head is wrapped in a towel, ( the bathroom is blue), I turn around and latch the bathroom door, that have a little lock thingy. I stand in the middle, (it a large bathroom) as I stand in the middle of the bathroom I realize its not his bathroom,and I my heart starts to beat fast, and I am getting really really hot, I don't know what to do. The towel falls from my head.. and the room starts spinning..  then the towel is on my head.. my heart is beat faster and faster.. i feel paralized..  i can't move.. i can't speak, I'm so hot..  and scared, and I have to go to the bathroom...  and this bathroom isn't Mikes..   and the towel falls.. again..   and i try to get it. . but its still on my head.. and I'm so hot.. I want to rip my clothes off.. but I'm afraid someone will see me naked, but i know, this isn't his bathroom and is seems so real, and I have to go to the bathroom, and the room is spinning and I'm so hot..  and I'm trying to scream.. and trying to scream.. and I want out and I just can't move...   and I don't know what to do...   and then I hear a scream.. and I feel the bed underneath me...    and I feel my heart pound..  and I'm awake...    And I just lay there...  i feel like its had to breath.. and I"m alone in my boyfriends bed, and I know hes in the other room, but I"m so scared, of what is going to happen, and did I really scream, or was it part of the dream..   and I just lay there, and my heart is just pounding.. I've never felt anything so scary in my life..      So i go into the other room.. and my boyfriend looks at me.. and I ask him.. did i scream and he says.. yes.. and I tell him a little bit about it..   and I tell him I'm scared to go to the bathroom..    but.. I go anyway...  I'm so scared something is going to happen, but I know that my fear is unrealistic.. but my heart pounds faster as I walk into the bathroom anyway.. and everytime i think of the blue bathroom, just as I am now.. I feel the same fear.. I felt..  After I went back to bed.. I think I cried for about an hour..  trying to tell myself not to be scared. I don't understand. I don't want to dream these things, or feel this things. I don't like things that are beyong my control..   but who does. Does anyone have anything helpful that they do, when they experience things like this...   ??

      Duh.. I do.. I really do. I'm so emotional tonite. Hardly enjoyed D's company. Enjoyed some music in chat and on webcam though, that he invited me to. It was nice, long haired guys, singing..  it rocked.  But..then.. I message my favourite person, N, and  I saw him on late last nite, and a little tonite, but had too much anxiety to message him. Which is stupid. But i have feeling like I am bothering him all the time. He said I could bother him anytime.  :(   What is wrong with me? Why do I have this stupid crush.  It just makes me feel stupid, for wanting something I can't have. Why do I always want guys, that aren't available?    Then, DN, an old friend, who really likes me, or so he says, came on tonite. He usually show up one nite a week, mostly Thursdays...  and tells me how much he misses me.. asks me to view my cam..and then wants me to show off, and I tell him I can't.  Or I don't want to. Last time we talked, I was very upset.. to begin with, and told him . i didnt want him to ask me.. and he did.  Tonite, well, i was talking with D about him.  And asked him how do I annoy him.. to get rid of him.. well I told him he couldnt view my cam.. cuz i had it on yahoo.  He said. he'd leave.. cuz I was busy, part of me didn't want him to leave, but all i could do .. is feel pain, and I was very upset..  I hate feelings sometimes.. alot of the time, mine are overly.. something..  and .. I get too emotional about everything.  Like N.  he probably (although he knows alot about me) thinks I'm a fucking nutcase...  if i were him, I think I'd put me on ignore.. or something.     Why am I even saying this?  I don't know..  I feel like I'm going crazy....  HELP ME!!

      Jennifer Aniston! Who said smart and sexy don't go hand in hand? Proving she knows what she's doing, the lovely Mrs. Pitt became the standout star of Friends before snagging her equally lovely husband Brad. Like Jennifer, you're a woman who knows what she wants. There will be no damsel-in-distress act for you; it's your independence that really drives men wild. A bit of a tomboy at heart, your great body comes from doing push-ups not wearing a push-up bra. When it comes to beauty, you like to keep it simple: a few coats of mascara, a cream blush and a sheer lipstick in a warm, neutral tone. But more than makeup, you have a natural glow that comes from eating well and lots of exercise. As for clothes, you love modern designs that show off the figure you've worked so hard to get. A sleek, asymmetrical top or simple strapless dress is all you need to leave him breathless.

      Not even sure what to say today. I read posts from others in my support groups for depression, and BPD, and I think, my life could of been must worse.  I didn't go thru alot of things like they did.  I cry as I read the posts, both for their life and for mine.  The feelings are so intense.  Scary.  Then I sit here and wonder why I feel so bad, so depressed..  I mean.. was my life really that bad? Do I have a right to be depressed and upset and angry?  I really don't know... but I do.   Met a really nice guy the other day,online.  He seems nice so far anyway. Respectful, very.  He seems to be very open, and we've had some nice discussions.  Really hope we get to chat tonite.   I got a job. I officially work at Wal-mart.  I am a little excited, but nervous at the same time. I've never worked in the deli, and am not sure how much I'll like it. I'm kind of tired of sitting around waiting for what is going on with my supposed move. I need to get a life. I need to move on.   I wish my past didn't haunt me so much. Its scary. I met with my caseworker today. She works with a program that helps with transportation for dr's appts.. and housing.. and bills and stuff. We have alot in the works, and I hope this helps alot of my stressors out.  I'm so far in debt, I don't know what to do.   Hopefully things will work out well. I've been lucky so far this week, but I need to get my car fixed, or get a new one. Wish me luck. I need all I can get.   So far away, wondering where, What are you doing? Are you there?  I look around, take a glance, Wondering if, I have a chance.  Smiling face, wind in my hair, I'm still wondering, Are you there?  If you are, I say come here, Please, and have no fear.

      So funny, so wierd, and yet still unfulfilling..   that's life.     Why do things have to be the way they are?   Why can't people just be honest? I don't get it. It would help me a great deal.  I can't deal with the stress of life. Not sure where to turn. Noone understands me... even the ones that think they do.  I can't get the help i need, and I don't know what I'm supposed to do. Part of me wants to live, part of me is already dying....         Dying inside, Crying inside, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide.  Where do I go,  where do I stay? Where is my life, do I go which way?  To live, to die, to hide to cry. Do you know?  I want to know why.  Feeling of mistrust, Unguided love, Please help me Lord, If you are above.

      I wish someone in this world could really understand me.. .. I wish people knew what to say to me, when they hestitate to call me, or message me.. or write.. or whatever.  I wish I could say what I need, but all I need is for someone to love me, and to be there for me.    When I get bad, that is when everyone gets scared.  That is when I need somebody the most.  I hate love, alot, but I also love it.  I hate that love hurts so much.  I just am tired of hurting, tired of feeling so much pain. Tired of doctors that don't know what the fuck they are doing.  Why does shit suck so much?  I don't fucking get it.    Am I angry???? YES!!   WHY WHY WHY???  I will always fucking ask why.  Why can't the nice people be happy?  Why do the rich keep getting richer? Why isn't the world fair.  Why do I have to have the family I have. Why was I put on this Earth??   WHY WHY WHY????

      I can't say I've ever really said I hated anyone, until now.  I hate my grandma, sure parts of me love her too, but right now, I want to do is choke the shit out of her.  She's so mean, always putting me down, telling me i'm a slut, a liar, a thief, a whore, and worthless, any thing she can say to hurt me.  Her dog is sick, so she's putting her to sleep, and also doing the same to my cat, because she wants to hurt me. I love my cat so much, she's always been there for me, she doesnt deserve this. She's a good kitty, I dont' want to lose her. She's been in my life for over 12 years. ... since she was a little baby, a kitten, just born.   I just hurt so much anymore, I can't stand my grandma even talking to me. I think part of it, is she just tries to make converation, but everything she does irritates me. She'll ask me things, right when i'm in the middle of something, or not answer me when I ask her something. She sits there and trys to talk to me while i'm doing my breathing machine, knowing I can't talk, or waits till i walk in the other room.  I dunno, all i know is I don't know how much longer I can take this, and I have nowhere to go.  Nowhere.   I'm the lost girl.  Read an article today, about Borderlines, and all i've done since is cry.  I don't know what to do with myself, with my life.... with Darian.  It all hurts too much, living, breathing...  why do i have to feel such pain?   Why do I feel like I'm not loved?     Anonymous Account of the Borderline Personality  Disorder       THEORY   All the information on symptoms, behavior,  destructive tendencies,  random outbursts, insecurity, instability, etc  are unquestioned and  obvious - especially when you spend much time  around these people.  The descriptions cover all the amorphous  manifestations of this  problem. In my opinion however, the mental health  community has  apparently missed what is actually happening.  What they are seeing  aren't any number of spurious abnormal behavior  patterns, symptoms  or defense mechanisms meant to protect the person  from threat or  depression. As a matter-of-fact, much of their  behavior is quite  normal and deliberate. At this point, I hope you  are wondering how.   The reason their behavior is normal and  deliberate is because what  is being experienced by the BPD person and  witnessed by those around  them is predominantly: THE NORMAL BEHAVIOR OF A  CHILD. Of course,  the abnormality/problem comes in because these  people aren't  children - they're adults. Well, maybe they  aren't completely  adults - not yet anyway. Their  psychological/emotional maturation  was "stuck" (arrested), or more accurately stated  "trapped",  sometime in their youth due to some perceived  loss, real loss, or  abuse. From that point on, these people  essentially have only had  the identity components and relationship capacity  of the child they  were at the time of the loss (but definitely not  more than a  teenager). Their intellectual and physical  maturity continued  reasonably unabated, but what must be realized is  that each area of  personal growth can occur independently of the  others. What you have  in the BPD person is a physical/intellectual  adult and a  psychological/emotional child. They are only  doing what they know  how to do - what they were capable of at the time  of their perceived  or real loss!   There isn't any question that the  psychological/emotional child part  of the BPD person is distressed. It is fearful,  angry or depressed  depending on what caused its original trauma. It  is actually fear  and their subconscious misconception, "I can't do  this alone!", that  is part of the trap that prevented the person  from maturing.  Nevertheless, it is very easy to create a  psychological profile on  these people using the normal psyche of a child  as the basis and  couple it with what might be considered a  traumatizing component. If  you study all the BPD articles and psychological  descriptions  currently available, it almost jumps out that you  are looking at the  psyche of a child, a disturbed child indeed, but  still a child. It  should also be obvious that anything as pervasive  as the endless  list of so-called BPD symptoms suggests that what  you have is  general behavior, not ten thousand individual  defensive mechanisms  or symptoms all acting at once. If you don't see  this, then you are  undoubtedly as confused as the mental health  community evidently is.  While BPD behavior frequently seems chaotic and  irrational,  reconsider, isn't that what you would expect from  a distressed  child? What you have then is: a once severely  distressed child has  become what the mental health community has  labeled as a BPD adult;  an adult which frequently has uncontrollable,  erratic behavior. In  reality, the BPD label is truly insignificant,  what you actually  have is an adult with the "stuck" psyche of a  child.   I have read countless articles relating  information on the self,  self activating, and other self references. It is  more a semantic  rather than an actual discussion on the what you  call the self, but  for me, the self is your soul/personality; in  other words, who you  are. How your self (soul, personality or whatever  you want to call  it) interacts/relates in life is based on what  level of emotional  and intellectual maturity you have achieved (both  conscious and  subconscious). Therefore, the self is always  there, active and is  always a complete entity; maybe certain  components aren't in sync  with each other, but they are there.   The articles I've read tie all the pieces  together beautifully up to  the point of breakdown/loss; including all the  facts about the  breakdown, that the person was a child, and all  the ensuing symptoms  manifested by the person as an adult. From this  point on, each  article takes a departure into mysterious psychic  phenomena as the  source of symptoms and behavior. The mental  health professionals  have evidently chosen to neglect the key  ingredients in order to  force BPD behavior into the existing paradigms of  psychology.  Nevertheless, the key ingredients are: 1) you  started with a child  which obviously had the psyche of a child; 2)  something happened to  stop the child's psychological/emotional growth;  3) you now know  that you have an adult with behavioral problems;  but if you look  closely, their behavior is suspiciously similar  to that of a child.  Simple logic and common sense will tell you to  stick with a of line  of reasoning that includes the key ingredients;  don't take a radical  departure. If you start with a child and the  child stops growing,  one thing is for sure - you still have child! Any  extraneous psychic  involvement/elements are peripheral or  supplementary.   You can even map every so-called symptom/behavior  of a BPD to the  behavior of a distressed child.   Just for curiosity, lets map a few  symptoms/behavior and see what  happens:   SPLITTING/TRANSIENT BEHAVIOR:   When a child is two years old, his first lessons  are polarized -  good or bad. His learning continues in this  manner for quite some  time. All his behavioral teaching has polarized  overtones to  coincide with the limited intellectual capacity  of a child. He also  learns to attach subconscious feelings to these  conscious  lessons/concepts, for instance - love or hate.  From then on, (until  he matures) he can feel or express total love  towards someone  because of something good/agreeable, and in the  very next instant,  feel or express hate towards them because of  something  bad/disagreeable. Because he is still a child,  all these are  extremely transient and lacking in depth.  Polarized, short term  behavioral elements are very normal in children  and will continue  well into their teens; or unfortunately longer,  if there is a  problem.   PROJECTION:   Children either can't accept  responsibility/accountability for  certain aspects of themselves, certain  overwhelming experiences, or  don't want to be punished for bad behavior (even  internally by  feeling guilty), so it's a convenience to  displace responsibility  and put the blame on someone else. This is very  obvious behavior in  a child but takes on a little more sophistication  in an adult  because the mature intellect becomes a factor  which has a greater  capacity to manipulate/rationalize circumstantial  factors.   A child will deny bad behavior or transfer it to  someone else, even  if a parent/adult is completely aware or  witnessed what actually  happened. Nevertheless, a parent/adult usually  dismisses the  incident anyway as childish nonsense. However, it  boggles the mind  to witness an adult do the same thing; it isn't  normal mature  behavior. When an adult projects, what usually  ensues is some kind  of argument on what actually happened and who  actually did what. The  truly amazing part, though, is no matter how you  confront the  projecting adult, they will deny everything, the  same as a child  does. This truly is childish behavior - and it is  one capacity of a  child or a BPD adult.   If a BPD is emotionally stressed, they are  automatically in  the "trapped child" zone of their psyche. In this  area, they can't  see themselves as anything but a victim. Their  behavior is always in  response to an encounter, not the provocation.  The other person is  always the bad guy and is always at fault.   IDENTITY:   A child is intuitively aware of his dependence on  an external source  for his emotional, circumstantial, and physical  well-being. He  perceives himself as limited in his capacity to  deal with real-life  obligations and responsibility and really doesn't  want it anyway.  All he really wants is superficial  responsibility, the kind that is  fun and provides personal gratification but has  no real  consequences; leave the real stuff to the adults.  He wants his life  to be in the realm of fantasy and play.   If a child is thrust into what he perceives as  real-life/adult  responsibility and emotional/psychological  independence to soon (the  emotional abandonment or betrayal scenario), all  his limited  characteristics become evident and amplified. He  feels weak,  insecure, inferior, angry, unhappy, inadequate,  distrustful, etc;  all the real capacity of a emotionally hurt  child. As this child  matures, especially through adolescence, he  probably wont develop  healthy and mature replacements of confidence and  growth beyond his  childish limitations. Instead, as a substitute,  he builds a  fortress, an outward facade/image which gives the  appearance of  competence and security.   As he grows, he can sense his facade and that not  much inside  himself seems real; he therefore begins to feel  very empty and  hollow, even more so than a normal teenager does.  This is an early  and recurring sign that his intellect and his  emotions are way out  of sync. His conscious intellect is aware that  something is wrong  but he can't control or identify exactly what it  is; and,  unfortunately for the BPD, wont get any better.   If the child/BPD has some external attribute, you  will generally see  an exaggerated importance placed on these as part  of the cover,  substitute, and security for his lacking internal  psychological and  emotional maturity. Anything about his person, 1)  physical or  intellectual; 2) anything material, anything new  or lavish; 3) any  social ties, especially a number of close  friends/companions; 4)  anything to cling to as foundation or  fulfillment; all become part  of the facade and crutches for security.   Since children/teenagers are in constant need of  entertainment and  fun and are exposed to too much of the wrong  kind, the BPD person  will most likely pick up destructive habits as  sources of  desperately needed fun and relief. Mind flight  and escape become a  very important - even necessary - part of their  lives, and the  various sources that produce it also become  psychological/emotional  crutches.   RELATIONSHIPS:   A child initially idolizes his parents; they are  wonderful  superhumans, omnipotent heroes; so the child  worships and loves them  deeply. The child tries to emulate every aspect  of these people.  However, if something happens to damage and  breakdown the love bond  and idealization of his parent, the child feels  disillusioned,  betrayed and lost. He perceives himself as still  dependent but can  no longer depend on his parents, so he tries to  quickly replace the  parent personage by someone else that (in his  eyes) fulfills the  superhuman - hero requirements. Until this child  matures and truly  becomes independent, any significant other for  the rest of his life  will have to initially either have the perceived  superhuman quality  or provide some degree of circumstantial  security.   When a BPD person is an adult (in age anyway) and  engages in a  serious relationship with someone, a relationship  that should be  based on mutual adult love and sharing, it isn't  long before child- like relationship aspects arise and cause  problems. The BPD person  is only capable of limited love but needs endless  love, the same as  what a child expects with a parent. The  significant other person in  this relationship becomes the parent replacement;  available on  demand to meet all the personal, emotional, and  circumstantial  needs; but, gets very little deep mature love and  consideration in  return. What this person usually experiences in  this relationship is  what a parent does with a child/teenager; 1)  sometimes genuine love;  2) sometimes casual indifference; 3) sometimes  sarcasm, smart-ass  attitude, picking, provoking, moodiness, and  irritability; 4)  sometimes withdrawal and depression. Part of this  behavior comes  from simple immaturity and part comes from the  threat that the  significant other person represents the capacity  to hurt, betray,  and leave. Any interpersonal stress/contention  can amplify these  mood tendencies. Down deep though, the BPD person  knows he is still  dependent, so no matter how badly he mistreats  his significant  other, he doesn't want the other person to leave;  the same as a  child didn't want his parent to leave, in spite  of how badly the  parent mistreated, neglected, or abused him.   These are enough examples; I think you get the  idea. Debbie, you can  map every BPD aspect in this manner, from the  simple more obvious to  the complex less obvious. I reiterate, they are  only doing what they  know how to do; their behavior is not a collage  of random elements.  Their behavior is primarily based on insecurity,  fear, and the once  severely hurt child-like psyche (which is still  present  now, "trapped") is extremely limited and  vulnerable to anything or  anyone that is a potential threat. These  limitations make them a  stressful/defensive person with three reactionary  dimensions. Being  frequently stressed or on the defense, BPD's 1)  overreact to simple  stressors; 2) get angry or become depressed on  moderate stressors;  and 3) go into panic, rage, or deep depression on  what they perceive  as overwhelming stressors.   Everyone, BPD or not, carries some degree of  psychological/emotional  immaturity into adulthood. The typical gap  between the intellectual  and emotional psyche is usually small enough that  interpersonal  conflicts are infrequent and minor; so, the  average person can  handle these with few serious life side  consequences. The maturity  gap between the psychological/emotional and the  intellect of a BPD  person is very wide and pronounced which causes  frequent, major  interpersonal conflicts. Since emotional  responses are reactionary,  all you need is an confrontation between a BPD  and someone else or a  circumstantial problem, add an extra emotional  stressing stimulus,  and then look out. Depending on the degree of the  stressor, you will  see the child-like response from the BPD  corresponding to the kind  and degree described above.   The mental health community speculates on  chemical imbalance and  genetics as the origin of BPD. Although these may  be influential  factors, more so in one individual than another,  I still think it is  more a developmental miscarriage than anything  else. I seriously  doubt that it is possible to do a chemical or  neurological test on  one of these people and find anything but an  imbalance. BPD'S have  experienced some kind of stress/anxiety every day  for years. While  it is beneficial to treat the imbalances and  provide temporary  relief, the cure remains to help these people  with the insight and  counseling that leads to a healthy  restructuring/reprogramming of  the emotional psyche. I am aware of several  undiagnosed people who  have over the years outgrown the symptoms and  behavior. It stands to  reason that life-side experience will eventually  dispel childish  concepts and close the gap. It also stands to  reason that the  greater the gap, or lack of its awareness, the  longer it will take.  The tragedy is that BPD people usually ruin their  lives and many  around them before they grow out of it. I can  also say that I know a  few that are quite old and still manifest BPD  behavior; but, they  are in absolute denial.   A BPD person essentially is the child they once  were, including  their age and complete psycho/emotional content  resulting from a  traumatic experience/loss; the most traumatic  loss of all - the  perceived loss of nurturing love. Love is a  general, pervasive and  necessary psychological requirement. If fear,  repression or some  other psychic mechanism interrupts the nurturing  realized by love,  the result is a general breakdown or failure, a  cessation of  emotional growth and maturation. When the  subconscious psyche is  accessed for behavioral reference and the  feelings necessary for  relationships, it brings up the latest version.  Unfortunately for  BPD's, the latest version hasn't been  updated/modified for many  years; it isn't adult, mature or healthy. For a  child/adult who  suffers from this, their lives are subject to  this condition and  will be until they can understand and overcome  it.

        Love  Love does not hurt. Physical and/or emotional abuse are not a part of love.  Love is not manipulative, it should not be used to get others to do what you want. You should never give in to demands based on the, "You would do it if you loved me!" tactic.  Love is an intense feeling of caring for another person. It can take many different forms (romantic, friendly, familial) but it is always about caring.  Although it is true that a big part of love is putting another person's happiness ahead of your own this never includes compromising your values or being untrue to yourself.  If somebody asks you to do something that you don't want to do in order to "prove" your love they do not love you the way you might think they do. When you love another person you don't ask them to sacrifice a part of themselves in the name of that love.  It is very easy to confuse lust for love. The true measure of romantic love is commitment and trust not physical attraction.  It is possible to feel romantic love for more than one person at a given time. Just think, if it is possible for you to love both of your parents at the same time why would it be impossible to feel romantic love for two people at once? Don't beat yourself up emotionally if you find yourself in this unhappy situation. But be sure to remain single and be open and honest with all parties about your feelings and confusion.  Sex is NOT love. Love is NOT sex. Sex can be a part of romantic love but it is never mandatory.  Romantic love can (and often does) fade. When it goes there is not always a reason. When somebody falls out of love with you it does not reflect upon your value as a person or your desirability.  Love should make you feel happy, secure and appreciated.

      Trust is a very important part of all types of relationships. How much you can trust a person, be they family, a friend or a love interest, determines how open and healthy your relationship will be. While trust is an essential part of all good relationships it is very easy to give trust before it is deserved or to give it too easily. Are you the type of person who trusts anybody? Do you have too much faith in other people? Can you pick up on the signs that a person is not trustworthy? Take our "Are you too trusting?" quiz to find out.   Your score is 35. You have found a healthy balance between trust and skepticism. While you believe that most people are good and well intentioned you are cautious with what you do, say, and how you act around new faces. You know that there is a big difference between being rude and being smart when it comes to trust. You are not likely to trust a person just because they are known to you, you expect people to show that they are worthy of your trust. Good for you! You are smart about trust and as a result will not put yourself in risky situations - be they emmotional or physical. Pat yourself on the back and keep doing what you are doing, you give new meaning to the term healthy balance.

      Not even sure.  Well, dumb ass J. has been trying to get ahold of me. His gf has problems, female problems, like.. of the STD type, and he's like.. well..  I was sleeping w/ her the and w/ you. FUCK HIM... if he gave me the right info though, he slept with her last, and hopefully, was not even exposed.  Though..   the STD that it is, I was already exposed to, and well, .(wonders if I should continue writing) FUCK IT.. if people don't like what I write..and they are scared off.. oh well.  Well the particular STD is a virus, they say you don't get rid of it.. It's HPV, I was diagnosed with it years ago.. (about 6) at that time they said you don't get rid of it.. new studies say you do. All my paps have been fine since.  I get another pap tomorrow. I'm still worried, cuz I don't trust J. WHY THE FUCK did I sleep with him again. (cuz he was good) I'm such a dumbass.  I can't believe he even tries to talk to me. They way he called and started talking to me.. I think he was trying to blame me for giving his ex... HPV.. but..  he told me she had problems, when I first started seeing her. I guess its still his current gf.. but who the fuck cares. FUCK HIM.. FUCK her.. and her sorry ass.. cuz she doesn't know what a dog he is. I wish I was evil. I'd make his life hell.  I wish I could, but although, part of me is evil..     I couldn't even pay him back, for the pain he helped cause me.  But.. if I do ever get the chance to talk to his gf. Believe you me.. she will know. .. I don't find that men lying to people is right. Especially when it comes to your sexual health.    Anywhooo...  I've gotten to talk to my favorite person, N. the last few days.  Makes me feel nice.  I really like him. More than I should. I probably shouldn't write about him, because he reads this, but its not anything, I wouldn't or probably haven't told him to his face.  I just have this stupid school girl crush on him.  And he doesn't feel the same.. (well I don't know how he feels really). And.. I know..  it will probably be like most my other schoolgirl crushes, sure he thinks I'm cute and nice.. and stuff.. but  soon he'll find the girl of his dreams, and.. I'll be happy for him , and jealous at the same time, but that is when I'll know for sure, I don't have a chance in hell.  Kind of like Michel.  He knows... I still do think he's a doll, but I'm extremely happy for him and Stacy. Especially since I've talked to Stacy and gotten to know her a bit. She's a great woman, and I know she loves Michel very much.  Plus they look adorable together.  :)   But..   anyway..  Still talking to MM. He's still sweet and nice, but.. has become a big perverted..  Um.. I'm sure my flirting has something to do with that, but I've really tried to behave. Especially since he's a virgin, but he's 23 and I guess just really horney... Who knows..    I can't figure out men.     Um..  and then, also talked to a guy, that wanted just phone sex today, from hotornot, one that blew up his microwave when he was drunk last nite..    and  a few more that just want to fuck.   Pretty exciting day.  I started my day hanging out with the kids at preschool. It was a blast, they love me. Today was the first day that I wore short sleeves there and a few of the boys asked about my scars. I really didn't know what to say. I just told them I got some boo boos along time ago.  And that I didn't remember how I got them, it was that long ago. What do you tell kids, 3-5 years old..   I was fucking scared. I've always been scared the teachers will say something. and be like..  You are too fucked up to be around the kids.. or something.  I have paranoia or something.  I mean.. would you want a lady around ur kids if she SI'd?   I don't know if I would, if I didn't do it myself.  What do I tell them? I'm crying as I write this, its some scary shit.  Its hard enough when adults ask, doctors ask..   nurses.. and such.. but what do you tell a kid, I don't even know if my daughter understands, except that when I'm sick.. I get boo boos.  I'm still trying to watch myself, I know this is the week, the thoughts come. Whether because of my womanly cycle or not.. Noone knows.. but..   I'm glad I have lots of people to distract me so far this week.  No thoughts, feeling a little low though, my gram put me down a lot today, called me a thief... last nite.. a slut..  who knows.. what next..  I feel the pain inside, Within myself I try to hide.  I feel the hurt within, I can't even bear to grin.  I feel the anger in my fist, I want to cut my wrist.  Cutting,  Self mutilation, Self aggravation, Agitation,  Lack of love, lack of self, Think of me above all else.  I feel the pain... Inside, I want to hide.

       Nothing much going on today. Just thoughts in my head. Finally got to talk to N. today. J Happy about that.   Missed him lots.  More than I should probably. But I made some new friends in the meantime, and the one MM. , is very sweet. He’s 23, and living in Maryland. Originally from Guyana. Very sweet, and also a gentleman. Why do I keep meeting guys I don’t have a chance with?  I guess I’m just destine to have lots of nice, cute, guys friends, all around the world.   Feeling ok today, got a little down, because I was sharing with MM, some very personal things about myself.  Got me a little down, but he cheered me up, and then I took a long relaxing bath, and enjoyed my day. I wish I would of spent more time with Darian.  But I did spend some time with here, and she enjoyed her new Barbie Jeep.  I got it for her for Easter, despite the fact, my grandma is the one that told her she was getting it. 250 dollars well spent I would say.   Well, when I was putting the stupid thing together..   I was missing a part. I called back to Wal-mart to see if maybe it was left in the box..  AND IT WAS thankfully… so I headed over to Bradford to get it.  Well, of course I had a few minutes to spare, so I wanted to see J.  (I’m such a fucking dumbass)  Well, I saw him.. And spent time with him, and was intimate, but I didn’t give in to him wanting sex. And I didn’t give him any sexual favors. I found out he’s back with Liz, his ex. What a fucker….  Well.. Anyway..    In the meantime, I’m late so I head home.. And well..  What happens.. But that I speed, because I’m in a hurry, cuz I’m late.  And I get pulled over for speeding. Luckily, that is all they gave me a ticket for, as I don’t have insurance on my vehicle.   So, there goes another 100 dollars, not sure if I’ll even have enough to fix my car. I’m hoping like hell. Cuz otherwise I don’t know what the fuck I’m going to do.    Hoping this week, I have a good support group, this is my emotional week, and not having my meds, (or being allowed to have them rather) because of the allergy testing this week is killing me.  I have met some new friends.. So I hope things will go well. I don’t want any suicidal thoughts this week.

      Why does noone comment on my site? That freaking sucks. Pissy mood!!  Feeling sick, can hardly breath. Will I live till tommorrow?? of course..  i have to suffer.  My heart is hurting,  So much pain, Without love, What's to gain?  Nothing here to lose, More pain, the fear, So much sadness, Its too near.  Don't know if I can take it, Don't know if I care to, I feel the pain,  thru and thru.  My bones, my soul,  my heart aches, I don't know, how much more I can take.  Help me please, I need your love, Help me God, If you are above.

      Um.. I never thought about it, maybe I'm just a snob.  Check this urlLink  QUIZ  out!   Your Snob-O-Meter score is 39%. Sorta snobby. You can be relaxed and accepting of those that don't fit your criteria for being "cool", but you also have the occasional bout of superiority. Perhaps there are certain things that matter more to you than others, or you just get in a snobby mood from time to time. Whatever the case, you should refrain from judging others on superficial qualities. Don't judge a book by its cover. You don't know what fabulous and fascinating people you might discount just because they're not wearing the right brand of socks. Of course, this semi-snob attitude might get you a better job with a bigger paycheck. Snobs tend to have more self-confidence which means they get to call the shots. Watch out for those bouts of humility which are the hallmarks of a loser and can spell disaster in this dog-eat-dog world.   But anyway..  had fun with N. my crush. He's soo sweet adorable, and really fun to talk to. I always feel good when we chat.  I flirted with him way too much today though. He said he liked it, and didn't mind.  Feels weird, cuz.. part of me.. wants to say to him.  "I'd love to meet you." and part of me  is like, don't bother nothing would come of it.  I dunno. He's a little shy, so I tend to be the aggressor.  I dunno, I just don't want to scare him off.  I'm just going to enjoy our chats for now.  Not sure what else to say, as he has the link to this, and I wonder how often he reads it.  :)  SMILE..  :)

      Not sure where to start.  I pretty much hate everything, and see no reason to live today, but I know in my head, that tommorrow, I will probably feel differently. I feel so lost and alone.  I'm out of the loop.  Partly because I'm sick, and then, also my car is at the garage, I've not seen any of my friends. I don't like this. I've been housebound.. for a while now. Seeing my family doesn't help. I just want to know someone loves me.  I was supposed to hang out with M. today, but well, I guess he didnt want to hang out. I don't really understand, I know we were supposed to go for a walk and its crappy weather, and tooo damn cold. BUt..  in my head I thought he'd want to hang out anyway.  I miss hanging with him, and the boys.  I miss him even more. I don't know why.  Maybe cuz when I'm with him, I feel loved.  I feel like someone cares.  I don't feel like that much anymore.  I just feel tired of trying.  I feel so alone. I have so many friends, but none of them can provide me with what I need. I can't provide it for myself. I don't know how. I wish I did.    All i want to do is cry, I have tears in my eyes.  I'm talking with C.  and I find how much I don't understand him, and his life.  He wants to be with me.. and I can't say what I want, because I don't know. Part of me, doesn't him, and part of me wants to.  Part of me wants to go to Romania.. and meet him. I know we would get along great. But I don't know. I don't think I could ever go there.    I just want someone to talk to right now.. and  I have noone to call.  Makes me feel useless, like I have no friends. I  just want to push the ones I do have away. I hurt so much right now. I don't know what to do about it. I'll just stay here.. and cry.

      ... I'll be right there waiting.... waiting for you.. But will you be waiting for me?   I doubt it. I meet so many people. I feel so much pain. I love them.. without asking for anything in return. Maybe that is wrong of me.. cuz they didn't ask me to love them. And no matter what happens, how mad, or sad, or upset I get, I'll still love them, unless I find out they've done something extremely evil. I can forgive most things, a little dishonesty, cheating (though I'd not date that person again), stealing.. etc...  Its hard to explain... each circumstance is different. I could never forgive, sexual assault, or the molestation or injury of a child.. and of course, not rape either.  But.. I know people who think badly of me.. because I cut. I would never judge them, if they did the same. I'd never judge them, if they smoked, or drank too much, or were even addicted to video games, or porn.  WHY?? Why do they have to judge me? I don't understand, I don't comprehend....     Read.. below.. an example:   5/21/2004  7:08:56 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  yeah.. since they made me a cashier... i like that so much better.. my mood has improved.. like 220%....  5/21/2004  7:09:02 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  but.. i'm not really doing soo good overall  5/21/2004  7:09:08 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  i've beeen.. you know  5/21/2004  7:09:29 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  Same as always, huh? Glad works better for you.  5/21/2004  7:10:23 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  what do you mean? um.. its that week.. right now.. where i get really upset...  5/21/2004  7:10:34 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  and.. ... I've been cutting.. and I dont really understand why  5/21/2004  7:10:55 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  ...   5/21/2004  7:12:23 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  I'm really not sure what to say to that Julie.  5/21/2004  7:12:32 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  you dont have to say anything  5/21/2004  7:12:40 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  Then I don't think I will.  5/21/2004  7:12:52 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  umm..  5/21/2004  7:15:30 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  you think badly of me.. when I say things.... like that dont you  5/21/2004  7:16:29 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  Pretty much. It makes me want to stop talking with you, because I can't help you, can't save you, can't change you , and all I can do is sit back and watch the fireworks as you self-destruct.  5/21/2004  7:18:15 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  then pretty much.. .. I just shouldnt share with you, because.. its not really ur concern.... and I'm sorry I did  5/21/2004  7:20:23 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  It's not that. It's that it's a broken record. Same thing over and over. Look, I'm all for you sharing, and all for you expressing yourself. Always going back to the subject of cutting, or wanting to cut, or actually cutting. Then saying you don't know why, or how you can't help it.  5/21/2004  7:21:01 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  just dont worry about it ok  5/21/2004  7:21:06 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  i'll leave you alone from now on  5/21/2004  7:21:16 PM  Exalted Angel  Izu!  you dont have to worry.. or think.. or have me bothering you  5/21/2004  7:21:35 PM  Izu!  Exalted Angel  Alright   They thing that is the worse.. is .. I hardly talk to this person about cutting, or even mention it to him.  The thing is.. I used to date him, and he told me...  well... if I cut while we were dating, then it was over.  How could you say that to someone you care about?   I wrote another poem... this morning...    My love for you is strong, Believe this,  though we've not known  each other for long.   Each day my thoughts think of you, I want you more and more each day, What will I ever do?   A kiss, a whisper, I love you, beautiful words, full of love, Where did you come from?  Where you sent from above?   I don't want to lose you, for fear of a short life. I will always love you, Wishing someday, to become your wife.    Talked quite abit with EPB last nite. Especially about the whole wanting to break up thing. We talked thru it. I still don't know how much I can handle a relationship, but being without him, somehow seems worse. He gives me something to look forward to, something to dream about. He gives me inspiration, he doesn't lecture me on my cutting, because he so knows, he never went to any of the extents that I did, but he used to self injure. I feel he can relate more. He always is very sootheing and loving, wishing he was here, to help me thru my rough times. Though, it did hurt when he told me his heart is mostly hollow, because of his past.    His friends wanted to go to a strip club tonite. He said.. he really didnt want to go, cuz all that are there are scanky women, and the only woman he wants to see is me.  I told him he sounded pussywhipped, and in a way he did. I wouldn't mind if he goes... cuz.. I know, I have his heart....  and they have nothing, not even his respect.    There is so much more I could say, but not sure where to start, I started as a cashier today, and will be working on my own tommorrow..  a little nervous, but much more confident. I enjoyed my day at work, though it was long and tiring.

      First of all, since I've watched some specials before about land mines and how they affect life and especially woman, please humor me.. and   urlLink click this , and help to clear land mines for FREE!!  So, had lots of appointments today. Had to get my weekly allergy shot. My asthma seems to be doing well. I got upset about my job in the deli, talked to the "BIG" boss.. and well, they are moving me out of the deli, and into being a cashier...  so I'll actually know what I'm doing.  Finally got insurance for my new car, and got it registered today. Received my first pay check.    Things seem to be going good with EPB, and me.  He's sweet as ever. Always supportive,and doesn't lecture me on my cutting.  I worry though. Are we moving too fast.. some of my friends seem to think so. I don't know what to think.  I do wonder why he's so in to me.  He plays his guitar sometimes when we are on the phone. Its rather nice.   I sometimes wonder if he is too young, what he wants to do with his life, what is future plans are....  and what he thinks will happen with us.   We haven't talked about the HPV thing lately. I'm sort of afraid to bring it up, cuz then I'll just feel bad again,  because I know he's scared to make love to me.  But, its ok I guess...  just depressing.   Made some flowers for Cherie.. and hung out with L. last nite. Her hubby ended up coming home. I kept asking him why he wouldn't talk to me. He finally got mad about other stuff, (whispering L was doing.. ) and flipped out, and was like " I DON'T LIKE HER" , I almost started crying, I didn't want it to get to me. I just sat there, thinking about cutting... thinking about hurting myself.. thinking about death.  Wondering, what did I do.. why doesn't he like me?  WHY?? WHY??   After I left though, I got over it.. a bit. It still bothers me, but just because most people like me, I guess I can't expect everyone to.   I tried to see my OB/GYN today, but he canceled, was delivering babies. I'm trying to get something for this depression I have right before my period, since I can't get in to see the NUT dr.. until July. I talked with the Nurse Practitioner there, and she called his office and got me an appointment up there. Wednesday, hopefully he will be able to help. SHe was worried. I don't really think I'd try to kill myself, but sometimes its sooo hard... the overwhelming emotions, they are so hard to deal with.   I'm wanting to cut again, and well, noone is around...   I don't even know if I want to fight it.  It always feels so good. I don't want to get into this bad habit again. But how do I cope with this, with life, with being alone, with being poor, with wasting my life away here, and not being able to do anything about it at the moment.  I don't know.

      I felt more than I could handle today. I cut..  too many times to count, just on my shoulder... on my left arm. I was sitting in my chair, and didn't want anyone to see. It worked out well, it gave me some relief, but still not sure, how my emotions got that out of control.  I do know, I have alot going on,  a new job, trying to get everythign taken care of for my new car, a new bf, and a friend of mine dying. The funeral was today, I attending, skipping work.  I skipped work for so many reasons, and want to quit so bad. I can't recall ever really giving up on anything, except my life, which is really hard to deal with.   I hate the thoughts in my head. They are like these aweful voices of my conscience, screaming at me to die. I thought about doing the same thing that happened to CC, my friend that died...   Driving even faster (after somehow disableing my airbag) and just running into that tree.  Would anyone miss me? Would they care?    EPB is wonderful.. I'm just afraid of so much, I'm afraid of relationships. I worry I guess, because I feel we are both a bit needy, and just dating, because we need someone special, someone loving in our life.  I wonder if we will be able to support each other...  emotionally. I wonder what he will decide about, the fact that I have HPV.  Right now, he acts like he would love to be with me forever, and would be alright with the fact that we never made love. I don't know what to think of that. I wonder if I will have the strength to talk to him about what I did to myself today. And what his reaction will be.    I want only to do something with my life. I want much more than to just survive. Thats all I've been doing my whole life.  I want to live. I want to experience my life to the fullest. I don't want regrets. I want to be happy, to be free, to love, to be loved. I wonder, am I strong enough.. to make it happen.. for me, for my daughter, for a happy life.

       So damn much has changed in the last few weeks. I got a new car, a job, and I'm dating someone. I don't spend much time online anymore.  Wanted to share some new poems.  Full of love Unbearable pain Had so much to live for Had so much to gain.  Why did he take her?  Why couldn't she stay? We'd all give our own lives, to see her, just one more day.  What was it he wanted?  Why did she have to die? Why? We all ask you, Lord... Why?  She was special to  everyone she knew, A daughter, a sister, a friend. Why was her life so short? Why did it have to end?  I wrote this poem today, for a friend... she died yesterday in a car accident. I used to be best friends with her sister. She was best friends with my sister... Only 18.  It makes everyone sad. I saw kids at the Hub (local gas station convience store) last nite, all looking sad, with the redness of many tears that ran down there face. I saw where she crashed tonite coming home from work, there were tons of flowers there...  So sad...  Though. ..she wasn't wearing a seatbelt, some said.. it wouldn't of mattered, she still would of died.   Well, my new bf, EPB, I will call him. He's great, sweet sentimental, loving. I can share with him anything, talk freely.. and just enjoy him. I wrote some poems the other day, inspired by him... Here goes..  To this the man  I find so sweet, To this the man, I want to meet.  I smile, As I think of him, I smile,  I’m no longer grim.  To this the man, I’m falling for. Will you love me  Never more?  To this the man I think is great, Oh my, is love  Our fate?  To this the man, Whom I give my heart, In hopes that love, Will never part.        AND      Your love, Your touch, My love I can’t trust, You can try if you must.  Each day I cry. I don’t know why I miss your love, I miss your smile,  I miss the love, that makes love  Worthwhile.  Touch me here. Hold me now. Show me love, I’ll allow.  Slowly breathe, What words allow, Hold me tight, and  Love me now.   Well enjoy, that's all for now...  I need to get off so I can call, EPB.  :)    PS  MICHEL!!! I NEED UR HELP WITH MY COMMENTS AGAIN...
