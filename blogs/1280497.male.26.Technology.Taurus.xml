      Here's a link to an  urlLink article I liked  about blogging--it's funny that because I'm making this, I'm also interested in the ideas that come out of the blog idea.  So I'm behind in the game, but the blog is all about me, right?

      Google Answers is a great idea.  I just paid five dollars to have the  urlLink following question  answered:  This is a question about time zones, and it's pretty dry stuff, but the significant thing about it is that somebody was able to answer me within a couple hours, and that was with a clarification!  And I guess that was cool because people actually are out there, waiting for me to ask that question.  And I had researched it for a couple hours, and it was worth five bucks.  I tell you, this is the future of the Internet.  Or something like that.  Here's the general link to  urlLink google answers .  I feel kinda bad mentioning this stuff, because Google bought Blogspot.  So there's a little corporate shame there, but still, Google is pretty much one of the coolest things ever to hit the Net.

      I've got a few minutes, and why not post something that no one will read?  In class today my professor, Raisa Vulfovna Solovyova, talked about the GULAG.  What a shock to listen to all that.  You've heard plenty about Nazi camps, but you don't hear too much about the Russian GULAG that  predates  the German camps, that well exceeded the casualties of the German camps, and obviously, that was better hidden from the world.  Even Solzhenitzen's works didn't do the trick, and if you see a special on the History channel about concentration camps, their almost always going to be German.  Part of that, I think, is that when the Allied forces broke the German regime during WWII, the cameras were right behind them.  Cameras have never been able to capture that much detail from the GULAG.  I'm not a historian, and so my perspective may be skewed in one direction or another, but there's something to be said for this less-noticed-but-more-atrocious part of world history.  It takes conscious effort to continually remember that the work camps are a part of our not-so-distant past, and that there is plenty of room for depravity in the world.  It's scary to remember that the participants were normal people, caught up in a system that tyrants created.  There is no guarantee that this type of thing couldn't happen again.  According to Professor Solovyova, this is the type of prison that exists now primarily in Russia, partly because of the expense required to maintain a regular prison.  It's crazy to think that there are still people freezing in the mines of Kolyma, reportedly the worst of all the work camps, where Shalamov spent his internment, and based on which he wrote his  Kolyma Stories .  I'm new to all this, but there's so much to think about, and so much to learn for how to avoid these types of atrocities in the future.

      So let's talk a little bit about the idea that people write and they don't ever get read.  I wonder how it must have been for Mandelshtam, for Tsvetaeva, for Shalamov, to deal with knowing that what you have so carefully protected over the course of your life (be it protection provided by yourself or by your close ones) might be destroyed tomorrow, or that you might always have it around, but that you'll never succeed in getting it published.  So much stood in their way to having the kind of exposure they now have, and how did they deal with that?  And that brings up the personal side of the question: how do I muster the faith to write when I have zero guarantee that anyone will read it, much less get it published?  You might be saying, "Fool, you must purify your intentions for the writing itself, and that will eliminate the need to have other people read it."  I've thought of that, and I can't see myself progressing to that point any time soon.  But maybe that's what happened with the people who had to really endure before what they wrote was ever read.  Maybe Emily Dickenson really didn't care if anybody ever read her poems, and that she was just glad to have the creative juices flowing on a regular basis.  On a side note, after every thought I have, I feel like I should be putting in a link to something I read that would show you why I'm having these questions.  The problem is, my brain is not yet attached to the Internet in a way that would allow you to link to it.  Unless...

      Hello again.  There's something magical about eBay.  I had to sell something I didn't need at all, and which no one I knew wanted.  So I listed it on eBay and within 24 hours someone had bought it.  It was nice.  It's not magical when you just think about how it exists now, but it's magical when you think about how it was without it, and then somebody made it exist.  Yeah!  In the spirit of the weblog, here's the link to eBay:   urlLink eBay Is Cool

      Well hello everybody!  There's always a problem posting.  Either I'm working, or going to school, or something else.  But I'm not going to go so far as to say that if I wasn't in school, I wouldn't have any problem writing every day.  I would have a problem, but it would simply come in the form of laziness and complacency.  Ah, the realities of life--when I'm busy, I look at my hobbies like children look at candy, knowing that there isn't enough time to do them and dreaming of the day I'll be free to spend all my time the way I think I want to spend it.  And then the day hits, and the hobbies fade in their allure.  I had a professor in my freshman writing class who said that she dreamt for years about having the chance to go to a cabin and just write.  One year, she actually got the chance, and went up to the mountains to enjoy the quiet, the nature, and her writing.  You might have guessed that she was unable to write at all.  I think that happens to more of us than I want to admit.  I want to believe that there are authors, painters, airplane enthusiasts, and amateur geologists stuck in day-to-day office jobs, and that the majority of the population has a batman costume (of sorts) in their closet, waiting for the day when the bat symbol will be shone in the sky in the form of their leaving the job and moving on to the real part of life.  But that's not what happens, is it?  We get out of our work days and we go home, sit on the couch, and think about what we saw at work that day.  The job becomes the evil tyrant we spend pretending that we hate, but deep inside, we cling to it because we don't really know if there's anything more than that.  Is there?  Thirsty People.  I guess this is the moment when you get to read the post that explains what this blog is all about.  To be overtly ceremonious, I hereby declare this to be a blog about being inspired by things, about hating and loving and having passion for life in all its forms.  It is not about false enthusiasm, made up gestures and facial expressions to prove to someone else that we're alive--it's about the real stuff, the stuff that makes us stay up on a school night or a work night writing or talking or just thinking, and the stuff that will make us look back on life and say, "I did what was in my heart to do, and I can live with imperfection."  Yeah, my professor wasn't wrong for wanting to have that cabin where she could sit and write, but she was wrong for not writing like crazy in the meantime.  I know I'll look back on the days I spent in school, with a thousand ideas running in every direction, and I'll not be able to remember what it is that was stopping me from living a little bit more passionately, a little more fully.  Is it that I'm busy?  I doubt it--I find the time to watch a t.v. show every once in a while.  Is it my environment?  Nope.  Life's just right there, waiting to be grabbed, writing-moment-by-writing-moment, thought-by-thought, school-night-by-school-night.

      Well, it has been quite a hiatus since I last posted.  That's what happens when you're at the end of a semester.  I have to be honest, it's not going to get any better.  I have to give major kudos to my dear wife, Julie, who's slaving away on a paper right now.  I wrote the words about having to write a paper late at night, and how you just have to write the thing.  She seemed to like that idea, but it's always better in theory than in the real world.  As soon as I said that you should just write the thing, I just about went to the bed and fell asleep.  It was a close one, and sometimes you face that moment of truth where you will either stay up and get the paper done, or you will not get it done at all.  I have made decisions to stay up, and I've made them to go asleep.  I just mean to say that there are a lot of people that face these types of decisions every day.  I guess I don't know anyone who doesn't have to make it happen.  I believe "Just Do It" it is one of the best phrases ever uttered.  It's an almost perfect idea (when applied to things you should do, of course) because there's so much we face that isn't pleasant, that pulls at our hearts in a burdensome way, but which we know we have to do.  We have to teach ourselves to always retain some portion of our personal soul that's willing to always take the stand and tell the tired brain and the sore back and the stinging eyes that it's time to Just Do It.  And then when It's done, the body will rest and that part of each of us that stood up for what needed to be done will also rest and grow stronger and have better footing for the next fight to do what we know we've got to do.  We've got to do it.  Our greatest source of control in this life is in our ability to do the things we know we should.  Almost everything else is to some degree beyond our control.  So, take control and Just Do It.  You might ask, "What is 'IT'?"  But you know the answer, don't you, when you start to consider?

      The University of Illinois journalism department just released a website,  urlLink Deepthroatuncovered.com , that claims, through the research of sixty or so students under the tutelage of Professor Bill Gaines, that Fred Fielding is Deep Throat. The idea that a professor and his students would solve such a huge mystery is a very enchanting idea, and one that has me hoping that they're right.  It's not every day that people with little experience in something like investigative reporting manage to make such an impact.  Granted, Bill Gaines has been a reporter for the  urlLink Chicago Tribune  for a long, long time, but the students weren't, and a lot of other experienced folks have tried, and failed, to guess the identity of Deep Throat.  I don't really know where I'm going with this, but I guess it's sort of a feel good movie waiting to happen, and despite my penchant for feeling bad during those kinds of movies, I am rolling the credits already for this one, wiping a solitary tear from my left eye as Jules and I walk out of the theater (sniff).  I read an  urlLink article  while I was stuck on the Chicago Tribune website, which I pulled up so that I could make sure the web address was right for the link above. Upon further review, it's actually from the  Los Angeles Times , but regardless, it's about " urlLink The Real Cancun ", the latest, greatest reality-show offering.  I am not exactly entranced by the idea of yet another display of drunkeness and sex down in Cancun, and I for sure won't be seeing the movie, but Patrick Goldstein, the author of the article, offers a few interesting insights.  First, that the youth culture (of which I consider myself a member, in some sense) has become conditioned to accept even the worst reality display as better than "polished storytelling."  Second, that "The Real Cancun" is the ultimate post-modern teen movie, because it relies on reality to express what has previously been located only in fiction.  In other words, we've learned how to be unreal.  Regarding the last two points, isn't it interesting the way the youth culture (for that matter, every culture here in the U.S.) has been conditioned to believe that people will almost always act an honest way when behind a camera with no "script"  But just what is a script?  As far as I understand, it's a set of lines and instructions that allows the players of the parts to properly act the part that the producers would have them act.  And so, MTV and every other outlet puts to use what I think is the result of our culture's understanding of "what a movie person would do": the ability to have a script without actually having one.  It's sort of like the way that Improv actors are able to amazingly (but with suspicious regularity) read each other's mind as they perform a skit.  What passes as intuition between two people is often a memory of things that have been said over and over again.  With the ubiquity of television, the nation finds itself more and more like an improv group, or a close family--we're able to finish each other's sentences and anticipate each other's thoughts precisely because the words we are speaking and the thoughts we are having are the same ones we seem to remember from a Family Ties episode that comes on every three months on TBS.  The famine, of which these movies are a symptom, is a famine of original thought; after all, you may be offended by what you see in "The Real Cancun", but you won't be surprised.

      I am remembering on sitcoms (check my last post for easy-to-see irony in mentioning this) when the kids have party while the parents are gone, and the next morning, they realize somehow that the parents are going to be home early, so they start working like mad to get the house clean, and just as Mom and Dad walk into the room they put the last remnant of the party into the closet, which is already full. And then the parents get home and they take off their coats and open the closet door and all the stuff falls out. And everyone laughs when they make up an excuse that somehow works, or some such thing.  In that situation, I'm always appreciative of the kids' effort to clean up the house as quickly as they do. I mean, if we always worked at the pace those kids do in the sitcoms, we'd all either have heart attacks or there would be world peace.  With Julie on her way to pick me up, I'm writing somewhat frantically, and that's not a bad thing.  It feels good to know you only have two minutes to write everything you're thinking about at the moment, and you know that you won't even get close to saying everything.  But at the same time, you know you're going to get a lot more done than you would if you knew you had two hours.  Maybe I need to write every day for two minutes, as fast as I possibly can. There's some allure to that, especially that you will only have written for two minutes.  But I'll have an ulcer the size of the grand canyon by then.  You will notice (or you won't, but now you will) that I'm trying out the one-space rule for after a sentence. It won't be easy, but I believe it's the right thing to do, given that it's already built in for the period to be up against the last word of the sentence. And on that anticlimactic note, I'll stop.

      I'm reading a book entitled  Foreign Exchange & Currency Markets .  Here are the first couple lines:   Do you remember the first time that you visited an Arab bazaar or a cattle auction? Do you remember the first time that you entered the visitors' gallery at the New York Stock Exchange or a foreign exchange trading room? Your reaction to these experiences is likely to have been one of bafflement combined with a bit of amusement   On the subject of the authors' (Heinz Riehl's and Rita M Rodriguez's) perceived reader--just who the heck do the authors think I am? Yeah, I remember the first time I was in an Arab bazaar. Yes, it seems as though it was just last week, I was walking through the streets of Cairo, a canteen in my hand and an undeniable urge to scream out, "Bazaar! Bazaar!" Those were heady days, when I traveled the earth in search of bafflement and a bit of amusement. Thanks for the reminder, Riehl and Rodriguez. I would not have been able to relate to this book unless I had thought back to those experiences.

      whew! It sure has been a long time. this is a blog to say that I love Julie Harris Wessman, the girl I married a year ago today.  Whoo hoo!  Secondly, whenever I try to call somebody and instead get an automated message from the phone company, I can't help but wait for the message reader to say what message number it is, e.g. "We're sorry, but all circuits to voicemail are busy. Please try again later...[one second pause].  Message S-L-331" I'm waiting for the day when I get a call from a phone company, and when they offer me a long distance plan, I can say, "I'm sorry, but I already have long distance that I'm satisfied with...Message 442"

      apart from the regular travel that is inherent in running, for me there's a travel that takes place between introspection and the opposite of introspection (wait here while I look it up in the thesaurus...couldn't find a suitable word.) I am trying to describe the state where the mind rotates from being lost in thought and being lost taking in everything around oneself. I go back and forth between looking at the trail and the Provo river, and my own head, which holds the thoughts of the day and rambles like the Provo river does.  I go back and forth between the two because my body just doesn't stay quiet for long enough for me to be just thinking for an entire run. There is something gratifying, though, about realizing you've gone two miles and you haven't even noticed, until you're there.  The run today was a good one. I ran out from work onto the parkway trail, scurried around to the sidewalk, and ran by riverwoods. A girl and a guy were sitting on the grass by the road, eating sandwiches and frozen yogurt from Hogi Yogi. I ran to the intersection and then I ran across the street and headed up the parkway again. The parkway was comparatively shady, and I smelled the trees and spring in bloom. The air in the spring is sweet here in Utah. I enjoyed my run better because of it. I need to talk more about the introversion/extroversion later.

      So what's better--to run with your eyes looking at the scenery, or the mind running in its own little race toward something? Most of the time I think I prefer the latter, but that's lately because I'm still getting my lungs back. I bought some shoes for a price that basically brings the  average  for the last pair and this pair to $50 or so. It hurts to have to pay for something that is really just you putting one foot in front of the other a little bit faster than when you're just walking around. Not much faster, in my case.  So I'm on a rest day. It's fitting that friday would allow me to chill for 24 hours before I've got to make the 10 miler tomorrow. Good thing my brother Rob and I will be running together. It makes a huge difference when I'm able to talk to somebody while my lungs pop. It is a rest day, though, and I've been soaking in the feeling of not moving too much when I didn't have to. The cumulative effect of running is much more pronounced for me than when I run far for one day. Blah blah blah.  Whenever I go to  urlLink www.blogger.com , I can't help but click on one of the recently updated blogs on the left side of the page. It's just fascinating to eavesdrop on what someone else is living at a given moment. I read one from a guy named Pete, who's into drugs, the Hollywood scene, and a bunch of other stuff, but is interesting and different. You can get to his page (warning: he swears and talks about sex and stuff, so don't bother if you don't want to see the F word) through  urlLink www.acidlogic.com .  I talked to Naney and Grandpa last night. Naney and Grandpa are my dad's parents, and the past two weeks I've been recording conversations with them. We talk about stuff that has happened in their lives, and what they remember. It's a free-flowing deal, and I try not to push too much of an agenda, but it's tough. It's tough not to put words in their mouths. It's tough to walk the right line between impersonal and intrusive in the questions I ask. It's something I've never done before, and to hear them talk about their lives is probably the most enjoyable thing I do on a weekly basis. It's a couple hours in a week, I get to sit on the floor at their house and listen to them tell me about Uncle Phil and about their parents, about whom I knew absolutely nothing before we started these conversations. And in exchange for what is really cool, I get something even cooler--a recorded conversation that Julie and I can play for our kids, that will make them want to know more about my parents, and that will draw us all closer to one another. The last sentence turned out very much on the sappy side, but unfortunately, I've got to put the truth out here. My grandparents are people with a huge wealth of experience, and I'm their grandson, sitting and trying to soak it all in. I want to add that I want to do all this before it's too late, but I think it's implied in the action that there's only a limited amount of time given to get this kind of thing done.   By the way, are you interested in this type of thing? If so, it's a matter of taking a cheap hand recorder, putting a tape in it, and then asking someone about stuff you want to know. Most everyone will talk, if you ask them about stuff that's happened in their lives. The few who won't want talk about themselves are usually going to do it anyway because it's a nice thing. Listen to me talk, the expert.

      My phone has a bunch of pre-made text messages, so you don't have to spend all that time typing in the message. One of them says, "I'll be home in _ _ _ _ minutes" I like that they leave four spaces for the number of minutes. This way, I have space to say "I'll be home in 2100 minutes."  Another message is "What's your number?" That's for all those messages you just send to no one in particular.

      My brother Derek bought me the new Radiohead album. What a great piece of work! I have listened to it maybe twenty times since I got it a week ago. I don't really know what it is I like about the music, but I do. There's something I like about their style, both intense, soft, loud, harmonic, dissonant, rhythmic, arhythmic, and a lot of other stuff. Maybe I feel like they do a good job of conveying emotion, of taking my mind off the fact that there's a voice combined with drums and a guitar and other instruments. When a band succeeds in taking you away from the fact that they're playing instruments to make sounds, they're doing something right. It's like the figure skaters that make it look as if the triple lutz is simply a matter of pulling your arms into your body to create more speed.

      It's time for a little Saturday Screed, complements of a little extra time on the schedule. I read a few of Ernest Hemingway's letters. I bought a book about two years ago that is a collection of his letters to various people, including his parents, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, and Ford Madox Ford. Truthfully, I don't know all that much about Gertrude Stein, though I love to tell people that Hemingway hung out with her when they all lived in Paris in the 20's. This accomplishes a few things: first, if they know Gertrude Stein, they're impressed enough to want to read "A Moveable Feast"; and second, if they don't know anything about her, they think I'm better read than I am. Seriously, though, I would like to understand a little better what role she played in the literary movement of the 20's and later. Based on the letters Hem wrote (our relationship has developed to the point that I feel okay calling him "Hem"), Ms. Stein was a great writer, and a good friend. Here's a short  urlLink Stein Biography  I found (the picture, I think, bares this strange resemblance to the musician Elliott Smith).  Here are some things I really like about Hemingway, based on his letters:  1. He always is begging people to come to wherever he is and do something. He's social.  2. He misspells things, uses slang profusely, and basically doesn't give a crap about the correctness of the letter he writes--when he's writing an informal letter, of course. He could be pretty pretentious, if he wanted to be, since he always considered himself a writer.  3. He has his doubts. It's so humanizing to read parts of letters that basically express the thought "Do I really have what it takes to be a good writer?" To have a future Pulitzer Prize and Nobel Prize winner writing to people that he's not even sure if this whole writing thing is going to work out is an inspiration to me. I constantly think the same things, and I guess his method for dealing with that (at least initially--not the last years of his life) was good--to work and write and see what happens--is the right method for me, too.  4. He wrote a lot of letters.  That's something I aspire to.  Anyway, it's shorter than I envisioned it, but there you have it. Read the letters if you ever get the chance.

      A one minute blog post. This life is a good life, with summer cooling off just a little and the summer breeze starting to blow at other times than just at night. It rained a little over the weekend and was overcast enough to make being outside in the day bearable. My body is healed up from the marathon and ready to jump into some other activity, be it biking or swimming, or maybe everything. I wish I read faster, so ten minutes spent with War and Peace was worth more than just ten pages. They are good pages, though, and Tolstoy knows how to make you feel like you're part of the times he lived in when you read his words. Man I wish I was a writer with a book that critics could love and hate.

      I ate some pretzels and drank some diet coke and had flashbacks to my senior year of high school. I would sit downstairs in the house, eating pretzels and drinking Diet Coke (which, honestly, is not the drink I think of first when I'm thirsty) as I did my homework. It's cool to eat something or smell something and have that thing take you back a long time to a place you haven't thought of in a while. It makes you wonder what will make a kid that's growing up right now think back fondly on his/her childhood...will it be the smell of McDonalds, or Carls Jr.? Wendy's? It's tough to say, though I doubt that the answer is "home cooking"   I realize that Diet Coke and pretzels don't fall in the category of "home cooking" either. I'm not lamenting the state of this world. I like this world.

      It's got to be another quick one, but the lack of time just can't keep the posts from happening. That's just not acceptable. Spending time in a beautiful place makes me feel like that thing, along with the laundry list of things I've already thought of, would make me happy if I just had IT. But life is not built in a way that allows me to love anything for long unless there is great effort expended in loving that thing. If I had a beautiful place I could always have, I would simply get used to it and not appreciate what I had, unless I spent some energy in reminding myself of what I had been given and tried to use it as best I could. There's the answer to a lot of problems I have, like wanting to spend money, wanting to leave work to go up in the mountains and hide--I simply need to look at the things I do have right now and be glad for them.

      This is a blog that I found by going to Blogger and clicking on one that looked half decent:  urlLink Diary of a CEO   I thought, "Is this really a CEO?" and I think the answer is actually, "Yes, it is." Judge for yourselves, though I think this would be tough to fake. Well, not tough so much as just unlikely that anyone would bother. I think it's interesting, though, because it gives a look into the life of someone who's pretty driven by business; I felt tired just reading about all the events, the conferences, the business meals, and the traveling.

      Here's an interesting one:  urlLink The Trendspotting Generation . The article is about the media phenomenon known as "trendspotting", where a reporter finds what he/she thinks is a trend, and then goes out to find more facts that confirm the existence of this trend.  I like the way the article analyzes the culture, and I like the fact that the reporter is doing his own "trendspotting" article by writing about trendspotting. How circular.

      Late night work is back, and so I'm blogging as a passive-aggressive way of dealing with the interruption from being with Julie and spending some good quality sleep time together. Instead of the nice bed, the nice eyes closed, the nice Julie right next to me, I have Radiohead (not a bad thing, by any means), a microwave chimichanga, and a mostly-empty (now) can of Coke. Tough trade.  Certain things set me into a mode where I feel like writing, and one of them is to read other peoples' blogs. It's not as though I find all of them inspiring, but I guess the knowlege that there are thousands, perhaps millions, of people writing their thoughts down, making connections, bragging about their summer jobs--makes me want to put my laziness on the shelf and start plunking away on the ol' keyboard. There are no excuses left for me when there are about 1 billion blogs written by every type of person imaginable.  But spending the next hour and a half in this computer chair, wishing I could be home, isn't how I originally envisioned this night. I really didn't envision anything about this night. I block out this time most nights for our good friend Mr. Sleep. But gosh, why is it that I have to be dead tired, back up against a wall time-wise, before I'll sit down and write a little? I just hope I can be a writer, and that it won't mean that I'm always tired, always wishing I was doing something else, and eating terrible microwave food and gut-disintegrating sodas!   It's funny to mention this blog to people. It's just me, and so it's not as though there can be any other motive for telling someone than that you want them to read what you have to say. It's odd. I mean, I would never email this type of stuff to other people, but I'll tell folks to check out my deep, inner thoughts on this site.  I have to go to another paragraph so that I won't keep talking about blogging. Meta blogging, that's not what I'm trying to do here. Writing is an interesting thing (here I go on a meta-writing binge--someone help me) because one can write about writing. I guess you can talk about talking, but what else can have that circular quality? You can't firefight about firefighting, can you? Cook about cooking? Run about running? Eat about eating? You can read about reading. There's one. I'll stop now, while I've only half-lost your attention.  So Grandma Bergeson's funeral is tomorrow. She is Mom's mom, the grandmother whom I never really knew that well, who shopped at the discount stores, who sent us two dollar bills for Christmas and clothes with the thrift shop sale price tag still attached. She's the grandma who taught me about U.S. Savings bonds by sending one on our birthdays, who made tapes for Mom and Dad telling about the latest weather in Portland, Oregon.   She was a person who seems to have been shaped by the times in which she lived. She and Grandpa lived through the depression, and so she was always saving money, making sure she wouldn't go broke. And they didn't, but even up until the end of her life, when she was in the assisted-care place here in Utah, she showed signs of that still being a concern. She wasn't thinking completely clearly, but I thought it was telling that she mentioned that her "boyfriend" in the care center was a millionaire. He probably wasn't anything of the sort, and he died shortly thereafter anyway, but the point is, some part of her was still saying "You are in danger of losing it all!" even up to the very end of her life. I don't know if that's bad, or if it's good, or what. I just know that it's a different approach from the way 99% of America lives---without saving a penny for a rainy day, or even worse, going into huge amounts of debt to buy things that they shouldn't.

      One Act Play: Julie and Scott on Sunday Night, Late  ( Scott stands in the bathroom, looking at a pink box with the words "Two Tests For The Price of One!" on it. Julie is in the bedroom, sitting on the chair. )  Me: Julie, I think you should come in here  Julie: Is the test done?  Me: Yeah.  Julie (comes in): I can't believe it.  Me: Yeah.  Julie: I can't believe it.  Me: Yeah. ( They hug ) The End  Moral of the story? Julie is pregnant.  Yeah, that's right, folks, we are having a baby, and there will be a little one gracing our little attic apartment. I'm not sure what to think of it, except that she's now throwing up every morning and I'm walking into the bathroom to hold her hair back as she does. She shakes with the force of the digestive rebellion, and I'm left standing, wishing there were actions more soothing than simply holding back her hair so she doesn't have to.  Life is never going to be the same, is it?

      My sister in law, Shannon, said that Attention Deficit Disorder people not only have difficulty working on something for a long period of time, they also have the somewhat counterintuitive ability to hyper-focus on a certain task. I think that's sorta what I've got going for me. Sure, I might have a terrible work ethic, generally speaking, but once in a while, something will come along that just grabs me, and then I can focus on it until the cows come home. That's great and all, but I could use some work ethic to help me to sit down and do good, solid work for 10 hours straight.   I need to be able to just sit still, but most of the time, I'm vascillating between working, playing Ms. Pac Man, and browsing news sites. If there were some sort of frequent visitor program with CNN, I would have earned a cruise to Alaska or whatever their biggest reward was (trip to the news headquarters? Weekend getaway to Ted Turner's Montana ranch?). I swear I check news like an obsessive compulsive person washes her hands. What am I so worried about anyway? It's like I'm waiting for the news to be updated in the ten minutes since I last checked it with a headline that says, "Large flood about to hit Provo, Utah. Residents unaware" I'll realize I'm in Provo, become aware, and get out of town, picking up Julie and our unborn child along the way. All that lost productivity will be to our collective gain, and I won't even have to stay late that day. What a day that will be.  I figure, if I can't check the news every ten minutes, the terrorists have already won.   I drew a picture on the board to show my friend Dave the ease with which a young person who has adopted a cowboy identity can become a person who listens to rap music and considers himself/herself a hip-hop "gangster". By assigning initials to the letters for the words "cowboy" and "gangster", I was able to make it look like I was explaining a technical issue that we were discussing. I'm so very tricky. Little do they know.  But I think it is a funny cultural thing, that it seems like the persona of a cowboy, i.e. one who listens to country music, dresses in Wrangler jeans and cowboy boots, and drives a truck or some kind of threatening off roader, is so quickly convertible into the persona of a gangster, i.e. one who listens to rap music, wears more urban clothing, and drives a modified honda civic or some other sedan outfitted with a large stereo. That was a long sentence, but the point is, there must be something in the bravado of both personalities that can attract the same demographic, which is people who identify with a simple struggle for life, liberty, and good wholesome woman-chasing.  Stereotypes abound in the preceding paragraph, I know, but I have some anecdotal evidence to back it up! You see, I was helping to run an event that was held in Southern Utah this weekend, called UROC. For those of you who don't already know,  urlLink UROC  stands for "United Rockcrawling and Offroading Challenge" It is a sport that involves offroading vehicles trying to climb up big rocks. While manning the ticket booth, I saw two types of people (generally speaking, of course): cowboys, which is understandable, and gangster types who drove up with the bass pumping and Eminem or 50 Cent booming on the stereo. The cowboys outnumbered the others, but still, you have to wonder what would make a (wanna-be) urban thug want to go to the dusty desert of St. George to witness rock crawling? The answer, as you may have guessed, is testosterone.

      I'm not one for watching a ton of T.V., but I do watch Ed, The West Wing (a show all people should watch, regardless of ideology), various sports shows, and an occasional rerun of The Simpsons or Seinfeld. And so my opinion about television shows might be crap. But I'll give it to you anyway.    Ed  is the only show I can think of where the title character is the only character on the show worth hating. First of all, let me just say that I generally enjoy  Ed , but I think I enjoy it partially for the same reason I enjoyed Northern Exposure: it has good characters with real problems, and it's pretty funny at times. At the same time, I liked Joel Fleischman from  Northern Exposure , and I don't like Ed. I don't like him because he doesn't care about people. His goals are all related to chasing some crazy idea that will garner him attention and satisfy his freakish desire to see other people do stuff they don't want to do.  Ed's pitiful life involves a ton of people, but paying close attention to his interaction with people reveals an interesting thing: he doesn't really  care  about anyone. He only cares about a person who is pushing away from him, because that represents one less person he can convince to follow an idea of his. Why do you think he gets so jealous when Carol does anything that isn't Ed-centric? His purchase of Stuckeybowl was oriented to the same goal--be the center of attention, and watch as other people come together to pay homage to that idea.  I don't like Ed because his amiable exterior is nothing but a front for a diabolical desire to have others worship him as the embodiment of any number of hair-brained ideas. Each other person on the show has some attachment to others that is related to actual human affection, but not Ed. I like each person on the show, but not Ed. He's the least satsifying human on the show.  In thinking about it, that probably makes the show interesting, but as the main character, it's too bad the writers will probably make him successful, and the other characters will swirl around him in a worshipful dance. He ought to end up with no friends, or in therapy, trying to get help in order to see people as real, feeling people, and not just props to arrange on the set of an idea he has. Ed's continued success is the primary illogical aspect of the show, because nobody could stand living around someone like that for more than a little while--no matter how many times he tries to rescue them from leaving by dressing up in a knight suit.  P.S.  Do you remember when Carol decided she liked Ed, and she dressed up in the knight suit to impress Ed? Do you remember his reaction to her? He hated it, and not because he was confused about whether he wanted her (remember: he wants everyone, so that all can be his minions.), but because--did you guess it?--it wasn't  his  idea. That is, she wasn't doing something silly because he put her up to it, but because she thought of it herself, and that bothered Ed. You almost hear his thoughts at that moment: "What is she doing? That is totally my idea. I can't believe she thinks she can come up with her own ideas. This is so lame. But maybe if I could get her to dress up in a Robin Hood costume..."

      I'm pretty sure that 98% of all blogs out there consist only of links to online quizzes that will tell you what kind of cookie you are. I'm chocolate chip, probably. Or something.  Just watched an episode of the West Wing and it's got me thinking about the delicious way that the cast of characters interacts one with another. I mean, holy cow, this show consists entirely of people who  do not exist!  I know, I know, that's what fiction is, but the fact is, they might as well be real, because it's not without some twinge of sadness that I remind myself each week that this is just a show. I consider myself a normal person, someone who doesn't get all caught up in something silly, and here I am, totally captivated week after week by a television show. I could never meet any of the actors, because I would be just like the people actors always tell stories about--the ones that come up to them on the street and call them by their character name and ask them questions that give away the fact that the people think they actually are the characters. I would actually ask them what it's like working in the White House and whether they think there's a chance that one of them could be president, since the current president (I'm talking about the one on the TV show) is ending his second term soon.  I'm afraid for when the characters that I'm going to be writing about become real, because I'm going to cry for them, worry about whether they will make the right decisions, know that some of them won't. I'll be tense when they're tense, elated when they're elated, and sleepy when they're sleepy. At least we'll all be on the same schedule.  So Elliott Smith. I feel like I should write this part in second person, because a lot of the thoughts I've had over the last two weeks since he killed himself have been directed at him, are things I would ask him if he were here right now. Or I guess they can't be answered by anyone but him. Why does he have to prove out the idea that great artists are often very tormented people? Why does he have to rob himself of the opportunity to continue making beautiful music? Why can't artists balance the art they produce and the life they lead? I have to assume that the balance is possible.  I also have to assume that the poor guy didn't feel very good about things when he did it. I think the road he found himself on may have been a filled with good times, but a shadow of depression covered everything. That's what makes him a sympathetic character. On the other hand, suicide is the consummate act of selfishness, wherein a person loses sight of his/her talents to the point that he/she ceases to value life over the absence of life, fighting one's problems over giving into destructive impulses, and so on.  So think about this: what's better, taking heroin and suffering from the effects of drugs and a poor approach to health, or killing oneself? I would have to think that the act of taking drugs is more minor thn the act of taking one's own life, though neither makes a person elegible for any semblance of honor. Still, there are degrees, and it's interesting that it seems (it seems because I don't know enough to use a stronger term) that  a lot of suicide victims are at the moment of suicide attempting to get off or stay off drugs. Isn't it ironic that rehabilitation can be a gateway to choices far more serious?  The primary objection to the implication that rehab could ever be deemed a bad thing is that I'm not taking into account those people who give up drugs and stay clean, going on to having a great life, as well as those people whose drug habits lead them to death.  This whole topic, a philosophy unto itself, is not the point. The point is, I wish Elliott Smith had not killed himself, perhaps for the following reasons, broken down by their proportion of the entire amount of regret that I have:   1. 50%: Purely Selfish desire to have his music creation around for more years than we ended up with; 2. 30%: Somewhat selfish desire to see Elliott Smith be successful in both the artistic and the private realms of his/her life--probably related to my liking his music (and although he often denied the connection) and the man behind the lyrics and beautiful melodies; 3. 20%: Purely unselfish desire to deflect the grief and pain of his close friends and family, who undoubtedly must be anguished over his loss.  God Bless you, Elliott, for a life shortened, but lived nonetheless. I value the music and the feelings I've had listening to it. That's pretty much all I can say about it.

      I have to post a eulogy of sorts for Elliott Smith, maybe my favorite music artist, who killed himself two weeks ago in his own apartment. But I can't devote the time right now, and so I'll have to try later. Here's some stuff that you can read if you want to know about his life:   - urlLink Pitchforkmedia News.  Pitchforkmedia is a great site, because it has a great news staff for music, and you can tell that these folks have listened to a lot of music. It's one of the sites I check often. - urlLink Really good KCRW show.  This is a great tribute show from one of the most prominent REAL music radio stations, and you can listen to some of his music. - urlLink MTV Article.  Oddly enough, it's a good article. It wasn't what I expected from the corporate juggernaut, MTV.

      I got an email today that asked me if I wanted to go on a blind date with 100,000 people. How are we all going to fit into my little car? Plus, I'm married! Take your largest date ever and sell it to someone else.  Looking at other people's blogs, I realize that I have a shopping list for getting a better blog. The items are as follows:  1. Get a decent looking template, preferably something that looks like it wasn't chosen from Blogger directly (mine was, of course)  2. Write more often, prefereably starting in 2001. (I wonder if there's a way to retroactively fill the blog to make it look as though I had been blogging since the beginning--In March of 2001, I'll submit my analysis that we are vulnerable for terrorist attacks. Someone will discover me, I'll be on CNN in three months as the prophet-blogger, then be exposed and humiliated in front of billions when it is discovered I haven't really been blogging that long.)  3. Figure out what is wrong with what little archives I do have. (the earliest stuff I can't access for some reason, getting an error message that says it doesn't have such-and-such a page)  4. Stay up to date on some issue that actually allows people to relate to me. (Currently, as you might tell, I'm only interesting to those who have known me personally. To know me is to love me, of course.)  So there you have the beginnings of the great blog this will undoubtedly become.

      This article-- urlLink Wal-Mart gas plans fuel controversy --excites me, because I can't wait for Wal-Mart to start selling gas for less than your average gas station! I have to wonder if there aren't going to be less huge hikes in price for the consumer if Wal Mart is the one negotiating the deal instead of the thousands of individual people.  I have an issue with Wal-Mart's employee policies, which prevent a person from getting health benefits for longer than your average company. But at the same time, I have no problem with paying less for something that is basically the same no matter where you go. Gasoline happens to be one of those things, and I'm overjoyed when this great capitalistic society of ours makes possible reduction of inefficiency for the average man. Is it good for the small gas station owner? Not at all. Is it good for everyone else, who represents a thousand times the number of gas station owners? I think so.  Wal Mart is one of the great phenomenons of the last twenty years, when you start to think of the economic impact. I'll have to find an article (one of many I've seen in the past six months) that tells the percentage of certain goods that Wal Mart sells in America, and it's staggering. That's for another time though--I've got a ten page paper to write tonight, and the thoughts are, shall we say, less than organized...

       Post-Paper (Well, Outline and Intro) Cooldown   Well, I wasn't  quite  ready, but it was enough to keep me in my seat for about an hour, trying as hard as I could to pretend that I hadn't already been to the front pages and beyond of CNN, MSNBC, and other acronymed websites, only to get up and watch ten minutes of Sportcenter, all the while knowing that I already knew the answer to all those trivia(l) questions regarding who won tonight and who didn't.   But then, Elliott Smith came to my rescue. Not the actual guy, for reasons already blogged about, but the music of the man, on my jukebox. I am now officially using a retro MP3 player, if you can imagine such a thing. It's called a  urlLink Personal Jukebox , and I bought it about 2 1/2 years ago from a good friend of mine, Aaron.   It was super cool then, with a nice battery that lasted a long time, a whole ripping/storing/buttkicking system thing you could install on your computer and connect to your PJB (that's P J B, mind you, as in "not Peanut Butter and Jelly") to get the music from the CD to your MP3 bonanza, and most importantly and coolly, a 4.8 gigabyte hard drive that was, if you'll remember the first MP3 players, about a bazillion times larger in terms of capacity than all those rinky-dink Rio players.  Anyway, I now get laughs and snickers when I bust it out at work, like I'm toting around an eight track player, but I'm telling you, the thing works! And I've got to level with you, I don't live in NYC, where it's  de rigeur  to be on the ol' subway and have some amount of time when it would be really nice to have a playing device that's smaller than a deck of cards. Here in Provo, I'm alright with the bigger, less aesthetic style. Granted, when I do put it into my pocket it looks like I'm carrying a shoebox with a cord coming out of it, but I'm alright. The music still plays.   Well, I should mention that it plays but it doesn't write to the hard drive anymore, which means I'm stuck with the same stuff I've had on there for a year now. Luckily, it's got Elliott Smith.  And now we've come full circle, haven't we? I put on the headphones so that I didn't have to contend with the prospect of waking poor Julie up (she's "Poor Julie" tonight because she was sick all day and didn't have the energy to do homework when nightfall came), and started out with the intention of shuffling through a set on the jukebox I called "Acousticky Softy Stuff", which starts with Elliott's "Roman Candle", but has a number of different artists on it, including Bob Dylan, James Taylor, Nick Drake, Dwight Yoakum (thanks, James), John Mayer, Badly Drawn Boy, and others (enough namedropping for you for one day? Me too. But I'm sincere.)   "Roman Candle" is Elliott's first album, recorded on a four track in some person's basement in 1993. Holy Cow! He recorded  THAT  in 1993?! Anyway, so I listened to the first song, and I quickly realized I wanted to hear not the other artists, but the next song from the album, and the next, and the next. So I pulled the jukebox out of shuffle mode (that makes it sound as though there's some sort of lever system to change the settings. Please do imagine that there are such systems, because that makes it all the more retro-cool, which is what I'm going for now with this machine), and I've been inside Elliott's world for almost two hours now. The track playing in my ears right now is "Cupid's Trick" from "Either/Or", his third LP.   I feel strangely vulnerable right now, though, looking at the computer screen and listening to the music. An intruder could easily sneak up on me and bludgeon me. Let's pretend, for a moment, that he is able to recognize the iron-grate steps up the back end of the house to our attic apartment as something other than a fire escape, and that he can get around the deadbolt safely engaged on the front door. But once he (or she! I'm not assuming that every intruder is a man.) gets in, I'm as open to attack as a Wal Mart SuperCenter is open to, uh, the discriminating shopper?    Anyway, I thought I heard (and maybe even saw! I was open to all possible sensory input at the moment. Smell? Taste?) a person in the room. It scared the bejabbers out of me, though. The new glasses I have didn't help me much, I reckon, since every slight twitch of the head brings with it a kaleidoscope of light reflection. Everything's moving in Glassesworld.  Ok, you're wondering when this is going to end. Um, pretty soon.  But Elliott Smith helped me into a serious, serious groove, and before I knew it, I was done creating an outline and writing the introduction. What, no ten pages, you ask? Well, I heard from a reliable source that the T.A. only expected that much from us, and that my professor should have announced it. That's good enough for me, and although I had motivation and perhaps even gumption enough to write the ten pages if I hadn't received a call from the aforementioned reliable source, once I got the call, it was a foregone conclusion that I wasn't going to get close to the ten pages.   Guess what? Ten pages, double-spaced, is just nothing. Nothing at all. I bet I'm going on ten pages in this post alone! Okay, but you get what I mean. It's not that many words. Of course, if my professor is reading this, she's probably rubbing two red pens together to get them warmed up for the correction-fest that will commence upon my turning in the paper when it's due sometime in December.  Night is a digression from the day, and I think the same relationship is paralleled by my writing in the day and my writing in the night. I love the feeling of my hands just making words come onto the screen, and the brain not wasting any time worrying whether something is making sense or is the right thing to say for the given moment. When the time for preparation has passed, as it basically had for the outline and introduction to get written, it's a real blessing to be able to just open that box and watch the goblins fly out.  I've failed to mention that the film I'm doing the paper on is extremely interesting. It's called "Day of the Full Moon" (in Russian: Den' Polnoluniya), and it's worth seeing. Even if you can't find a film with subtitles, you would probably still like it.  It's sleepytime now.

       How to Retire on Just One Blog a Day   I was on the main  urlLink Blogger  page, and as is my custom, I checked out some of the ten most recently updated blogs. One of them was  urlLink this blog , which is about the RU-21 pill that's supposed to make your hangover go away, and I started reading it, and I thought maybe I'd learn something new.  But then I started to realize that, wait a second, this blog reads very similarly to a lot of those funny pharmacy emails I get every two minutes or so to my hotmail account.   So yeah, it turns out, the blog is bogus. But it's also totally cool, because it's a pristine example of someone deciding that this whole blogging craze could be a great tool for marketing, but also not being familiar enough with the idea to do it convincingly. I'm not even talking about the prose--sure, it's a little awkward and it jumps from one tone to another--but more interesting is the blogger Jack's process of "discovery" about the drug that he attempts to portray through the blog.  In the first entry, he puts the link to a place to buy the pill. In the second entry, he asks if anyone has tried it. The sixth entry he says it sounds interesting, but he doesn't know what it is (Jack's unrecorded thoughts: I don't know what the drug is. But I think I'll start A BLOG about it). The fifteenth entry, he says "I'm such a serious drinker that it's appalling, really, that I haven't gotten my hands on any of the stuff yet." Um, I've heard you can easily buy, let's see, six pills for 5.29, plus a free pill case. Wanna know where I got that hot info, Jack? Fourteen entries ago, in this very blog.  On the 21st entry of the blog, we're in business. Jack has tried the pill finally, and it's available at www.ru-21.cc, which happens to be the root address of the blog itself. It's always in the last place you look, you know?  24th entry: Jack says, "I just ordered some, thanks for the site info." "You're very welcome, me"  The thing I like about Jack is that he's a  really  fast worker. To recap, he was able to do the following:  1. not know anything about the RU-21,  2. research and learn a great deal about how it works,  3. learn where it's available, and 4. actually buy and try the stuff, and report on the results.  I reviewed the times at which he posted these entries, it turns out that he was able to do all this within the world-record timespan of less than  fifteen minutes!  This man is out of this world. I mean, I've been staring at the blog for, what, 20 minutes now?, and I haven't even bought one pill yet. What's wrong with me? Are there any pills to cure what I have?

      This  urlLink Washington Post Article  is funny, to be sure, but what's funnier are the Google ads that are pasted to the bottom of the page. The article is about how Americans tend to gain a little weight during the holidays, and the advertiser links? The two ads have the following respective headlines: "How To Gain Weight" and "Weight Gain Diet". We appreciate the irony, Google.

      In thinking about the Nov. 16 blog, I realized that the advertiser links are probably different now from what they were when i originally posted the blog, since Google does their ads dynamically. Duh. So I guess the net benefit from you obediently following the link to the Post story is that you learned a little about the tendency we have to gain a little weight over the holidays. You're welcome.  New Years. I'm one of those people that can't help but make a million resolutions. And really, why not? I realize I'm not going to live up to each and every one of the goals, but who cares? Maybe the biggest detriment to improvement is the fear of not reaching a goal. Maybe if people became immune to disappointment at not reaching some milestone they had set, and were able to be happy simply in the act of reaching, then perhaps mental impediments to progress would largely disappear.  I guess the philosophy relates to my experience with learning Russian. I quickly realized that I would never speak the language perfectly, and that people might always know I was a foreigner despite my best attempts to speak correctly and without an accent. But there were gains to be made, and those gains, though less of an accomplishment than learning to speak perfectly, gave me a lot of satisfaction (and I learned to love Russia and decided to make it my major when I got back to college).  So when it comes to the New Year, I figure that anything goes. If you make goals and don't reach any of them, look back anyway and try to see if any progress has been made. I think if the goal has brought any progress, then it was worth making. So here are my goals for the New Year (in no particular order):  1. Eat more fruit 2. Exercise more 3. Finish my independent study classes by the end of February 4. Be efficient at work 5. Make more resolutions as needed.  Have a happy New Year, everybody. I hope to be blogging often--definitely more often than I have been the past month.

      There's a new year here now, and I've gone and made resolutions. Julie was nice enough to help me today with the first resolution I have listed below; namely, the resolution to eat more fruit. She did this by placing all the fruit we have in a huge platter-bowl thing. She said, "I think this will help you eat more fruit because you'll see it easier."  I said, "Yeah, I think that's probably true." The fruit looked good, grouped in a nice platter-bowl thing and all, and it made me think of food. I opened the fridge and got a Coke out.  Julie said, "Maybe I'll put the Coke all together in a bowl for you."  I said, "Yeah, that would be nice." I opened the can and drank about two ounces, put it in the fridge, and closed the door. Then I picked up an apple and took a bite. A little soft, but a nice tasting piece of fruit, nonetheless. After I finished it, we had dinner, and I finished the Coke then. I bet you anything that I really will eat more fruit, even though I generally like it more if it's cold.

      I went and played two hours of basketball. Why can't I enjoy running as much as that? I feel like a kid again when I play basketball; when I run, I usually just want to get it done. Basketball is just more fun, let's face it.  I watched a few minutes of Michelle Wie, the 14 year-old golfer who is competing in the Sony Championship golf tournament with the best players in the world. It's a funny thing to consider that she was born in 1989 and is now hitting the ball 300 yards off the tee. Hmm. I think I'm going to quit golf, given that I'm not 14 and I can't hit the ball (fill in any number here) yards. I was just in awe, watching her and trying to understand how it could possibly be that she is so young.  Then she finished her round.  The commentators asked her into the booth to give an interview. One asked her if she was nervous, and she said something like, "Well, like, I think I wasn't really that worried about hitting it, and then, like, I was like, 'Don't get nervous!', but then I hit the ball straight." Ignoring the fact that she was describing her experience of playing with the best golfers the free world has produced, she was just a 14 year-old when she was talking. That was totally cool.  The only thing keeping me from dinner right now is sheer inertia.

      I put on some sweats and a long sleeve shirt before I got into bed last night, and thanks to that, I slept like a baby, dreaming of who-knows-what and waking up only when at eight thirty, Julie finally asked if I was going to get up. She wasn't impatient for me to do so, but she wanted to say something so I didn't hibernate until twelve.  I'm back on the herbal tea kick. I had forgotten its ability to soothe the soul. By "soothe" I mean "taste" and by "the soul" I mean "good". I have managed to admit to myself, though, that tea is better with sugar or some sweetener. I'm no purist, it turns out.

      One thing people do with blogs is they name them something latin. I was reminded of this fact when I pulled up Blogger.com on the screen and saw that one of the last 10 updated blogs was something-us somethingelse-us. Perhaps people are better able to express themselves in Latin than in English. Maybe the whole blog is in Latin, or about Latin. Dunno.  I'm still getting over the basketball marathon of yesterday. I'm probably still dehydrated.  We drove all over town today, trying to find a house. There's got to be something in our price range that isn't a) dirty; b) in a slum; or c) on a super busy street. I'm not complaining, but we're working to find something that fits. Haven't found it yet. I can list for you four things (out of the 100 or so) that every real estate agent says about the house they're wanting you to buy from their client:  1. Great neighborhood 2. Good schools 3. Great Kitchen 4. You won't be disappointed!  I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I won't be disappointed! I'll just keep saying that to myself until it's true, and I'm ready to commit 30 years of income I haven't earned yet to the purchase of something that might just fall apart next thursday. So far, I'm still skittish.

      I just don't care enough about professional sports. I feel as though this is an area of my life that has really gone downhill since I was, oh, thirteen or so. Back then, it seems my devotion to most anything that involved a referee was quite bottomless, but now, I don't even care enough to watch the Super Bowl. Also, I don't know what the record of my so-called favorite NFL team, the N.Y. Jets, was this year. I'm a sorry excuse for a thirteen year old, that's for sure. Sure, I'm nearly twice that old now, but gosh, I should still have the fire, shouldn't I?

       Are You Arguing With Me? Are You? Because If You Are...   Anyone have any ideas for a new template? The one I'm working with as of this date has me a little tired.  I'm sick. I'm hoping for a miracle cure just in time for my city-league basketball game tomorrow at nine-thirty.  I went to a trial last week, and it was the first I had ever been to. It was sorta like I thought it would be, but I was surprised that the jury was allowed to write down questions and submit them for the judge to then ask whatever witness was on the stand at the time. I always thought that juries were more passive than that, but I was definitely glad to discover that they aren't simply sitting in their chairs, drooling out of boredom (although on second thought, I saw some of that, too).   Witnessing a bona fide trial did awaken in me some desire to be able to articulate an argument as effectively as both sets of lawyers are able to, but it also awakened in me the realization that if I were able to argue better than I do now, I would simply become that much more annoying to other people, and there wouldn't be much gain from it. It's not like I'm going to sue Julie for not appreciating the Del Taco I brought home (she did appreciate it, lest there be any misunderstanding on that point).   There is, however, something to be said for the  sharpness  that permeates their demeanor. The attorneys listen very attentively to the other person, remember (seemingly) insignificant facts from others' testimony, and manage to bring those facts back into light to create an advantage over their opponent at the opportune moment. In short, they employ all the methods that would bring a marriage to its very knees. I respect that even though I fear it for myself.

       You Got to Move These Refrigerators, You Got to Move These Color TVs...   We're becoming surrounded by boxes with our earthly possessions in them. I will consider it a point of pride that we have lots and lots of books as long as I can drum up enough help to carry all the books down the stairs.  Shelves that were once full of things are now bare. The computer is still in its spot, mainly because we'll need it up to the point that we move. At last count, there are maybe 20 boxes already in the house, full of books, pencils, kitchen appliances, dishes, games, baby clothes, and other things. I haven't packed the two typewriters that are on top of the hutch on this desk, and the entire closet is still untouched by the moving effort. The closet may present the greatest challenge to moving, since it's so cavernous, and a lot of what is in there doesn't seem to go well into boxes.  This will be the moment when those who help us move see all the stuff we have, and will decide for themselves whether we have a lot of junk or not. They will think to themselves, "What's the deal with the Wessmans? Where did they get all this stuff?" This won't be idle thoughts, as well, because they'll be lugging it, box by box, down the tenuous iron staircase of the current apartment. "Good thing they are moving to a bigger place--they probably never had everything put away," they'll say to each other.  20 boxes and not even halfway there. Yeah, there's some portion of me that aspires to minimalism, but it so happens that that part of me is easily overpowered by the part of me that thinks having a motorcycle windshield for a motorcycle that I sold almost two years ago is necessary and good. I think I'll muster the energy to donate it to the Deseret Industries thrift store. Does anyone want a motorcycle windshield?  Jules and I are probably going to put the computer and the writing desk in separate spots. I think it will be good, because it's rare that I'm on the computer, but also needing a reading place nearby. So we'll see how that works. I keep thinking about the new place. Will it be warm enough? Cool enough? Will our neighbors be friendly?

Here's what I like about Chairman Greenspan's remarks: I think he is willing, due to his relatively apolitical situation, to say the stuff that people can't say in other areas of government because they're afraid they won't be reelected if they do; I also think that he points to reality.  I wonder, though, how this all jives with his  urlLink remarks about household debt . I haven't read these remarks in their entirety, and I just wonder how you can say that he's worried about the ability of the government to pay for baby boomers who retire, but in the same week say that it's no big deal to not save anything.

      My friend, Dave, and I had a conversation about outsourcing. I like the points that  urlLink this article in Wired  relate. Do you want dessert first? Okay--the last portion of the article (which is quite long) reads as follows:  t's not hard to see how outsourcing to India could lead to the next great era in American enterprise. Today, even innovative firms spend too much money maintaining products: fixing bugs and rolling out nearly identical 2.0 versions. Less than 30 percent of R&D spending at mature software firms goes to true innovation, according to the consulting firm Tech Strategy Partners. Send the maintenance to India and, even after costs, 20 percent of the budget is freed up to come up with the next breakthrough app. The result: more workers focused on real innovation. What comes after services? Creativity.  What do you think about that? I would like to believe it, though there's plenty of ulcers to be created along the way, especially for those who have to retrain to get another job when theirs goes away.

Because I get to press one button and have all the latest articles from the Washington Post, Motley Fool, Slate, and a bunch of other, random weblogs in a list for my perusal. I'm excited because I might (MIGHT) be able to get RSS to work for my weblog. If that happens, you could subscribe and never have to come to this sad site to see if today is one of the once-in-an-elephant's-life days that I actually make a post.   I started with Sharpreader to get an aggregator. Then, it was just a matter of learning how that program works, and adding sites that support RSS. Now, I'm twenty pounds lighter, Julie loves me more, and I can retire next August! Or at least have great information at the touch of a button. Easier than regular Internet websites?

[Awkward silence]  Me: Yeah, totally. Uh, bye.  So I'm no longer a proseletyzer of RSS, but rather, a simple, humble follower. The people have rejected my message of good and timely news delivery, of a one-stop clearinghouse for blogs and websites alike, and I will go to my own place and simply enjoy what good things there are for me.

      If anyone can give me one page responses for the following assignments, that would be great. I'm kidding, don't send me your one-page responses, but here's what I must overcome in the next few days:  Lesson 5: Trace the changes evident in Greek sculpture from the Archaic through the Hellenistic periods and discuss the possible cultural reasons for the changes.   Lesson 6: Describe the evolution of the concept of areté from Homer to Socrates.   Lesson 7: Explain how Aeneas displays the trait of pietas admired by the Romans.   Lesson 8: Compare the Epicurean and Stoic approaches to social and political involvement and give the philosophical basis for each position.   Lesson 9: Essay Topic: Explain how the following works reflect Roman cultural values: a.	the bust of Cicero  b.	the Pantheon  c.	Augusta of Prima Porta    Lesson 10: Explain Paul's importance in the spread of Christianity   Lesson 11: Describe how Christian artists and architects employed symbolism in their respective artforms to embody important Christian doctrines.   Lesson 12: Explain how the Confessions illustrate Augustine's view of both world and individual history.   Lesson 13: Explain how The Song of Roland illustrates the areté of the Christian warrior.   Lesson 14: Explain the relationship between monasticism and the development of the art of the illuminated manuscript.   Lesson 16: Explain how a Gothic cathedral like Chartres was meant to turn a Christian pilgrim's simple visit into an educational and spiritual experience.   Lesson 17: Explain how Aristotelian philosophy influences the structure of both Inferno and Purgatorio in Dante's Divine Comedy   Lesson 18: Describe how Petrarch's sonnets can be considered proto-Renaissance.   Lesson 19: Compare the ideas of Pico della Mirandola and Machiavelli on the subjects of human freedom and fortune   Lesson 20: Explain how Brunelleschi's work in perspective and architectural design reflects the ideals of Renaissance humanism.  And that's just the first class. There are two more, albeit less demanding, courses waiting in the wings--all to be finished by the 13th! But I will graduate, so help me.

I felt the same way about biology and chemistry when I was a freshman at BYU, even though I'm not a terrorist. I'm not! I promise! Please don't take me to Guantanamo Bay.

      You may have noticed the "Site Feed" link on the left hand side. You can plug that into your xml aggregator service, and it will go and get my latest junk for you. Beats coming to the actual website, although right now you'll notice that if you read the posts in the XML feed, the hyperlinks disappear from the words. I'm probably doing something wrong.

       Misplaced Post   The following post was something I meant to post on this blog, but failed to. It should have been posted on November 17, but I accidentally put it on a different blog that I have, which isn't really alive. Anyway, here you go.  ----------------------------------------  Newsweek Article:  urlLink Twilight of the PC Era? --tells an interesting story about the idea that Information Technology has lost its importance in business, because everyone is using it and so there's no competitive advantage to it.   The article gets its legs from an article written for the Harvard Business Review by Nicholas Carr. The Harvard article is called "IT Doesn't Matter."  I think we're looking at the industry of information technology the way people looked at the car industry during the early days of Ford. Despite the number of computer manufacturers, software companies, consulting companies, and others, the industry is still quite small, considering that there could be so much more computing done with everything we had. What about the fact that my computer and my refrigerator can't talk to each other yet? How come I can't program my lights to come on and off from a centralized console?   Of course, those are changes to my personal life, and not necessarily changes to the business landscape. Still, any time a technology comes out, there's this lag time between the debut of the new technology and the moment a company is able to understand exactly  how they're going to use the thing!  It's no small task to figure out what to do with something, especially when, as in the case of a lot of new technology, you can't see it, taste it, touch it, hear it, smell it, or even remember what it's called.   It would be easier if new technology were just a car that you could see coming up the road, with pedestrians jumping out of the way of the iron coach. Of course, maybe people had trouble really envisioning the way the automobile would impact them, as well. Who would've thought we could build our lives around the existence of a particular innovation, like we did with transportation that can get us to our workplaces twenty miles away in less than an hour? And we're still rebuilding our lives to fit the huge convenience that is the Internet. Let's face it--we've only gone part of the way down that road, and who knows what is next? It's always going to be a rebuilding process, and the innovations that take place will always be the catalysts for the types of change that make it possible for some to not even have to travel to work anymore.

       One of Those Things   I consider weblogs to be inherently good for society. I consider it okay if people make money from their weblogs, because that's sort of a natural result of something being good and popular. The point at which I become a little less clear is when a weblog exists because a company is paying someone to keep it, and it exists to make a profit.   I'm thinking of the "Unofficial ________ Weblog" set of blogs out there, of which  urlLink The Unofficial Google Weblog  is one. On the one hand, it seems to run somewhat counter to my idea of the blog as a highly individualistic tool that is not beholden to corporate pressure. On the other hand, there is the fact that plenty of weblogs are beholden to various pressures, and I should not be so naive as to think that every blog out there is some devoted volunteer that happens to have hours of spare time and little ambition to be rich.  So as I am writing this post, I am trying to think of what makes the Unofficial ______ Weblogs less attractive to me than they would be if they were individually run. For me, the key to it is in the word "individual". These blogs, while they may be run by very smart people, and though they might cover a variety of subjects, seem to come up lacking. Namely, they lack a special allure of the unknown--the totally unique!--that makes me addicted to not just a select few blogs that I have bookmarked, but addicted to random weblogging. The run-of-the-mill weblog is less a blog to me, and more an information site, because the blogger isn't there, in my opinion.  That doesn't mean I'm going to stop reading the blogs that are produced in this way. It just makes me realize (and appreciate more, I hope) that the thing I love about blogs is the people behind the blogs. No disrespect to those who (mass-)produce these types of identical blogs; it seems too bad that anyone would not be given free reign to say whatever they wanted to say about a given subject, as the author of the blog. Maybe that's not the case, but if there becomes a network of blogs published by one company, you can bet these will lack some of the grittiness and reckless abandon that gives a blog its flavor.   Update: Compare  urlLink Google Blogoscoped  to the Unofficial Google Weblog. It seems that while The Unofficial..."stays on task" better than the others, Google Blogoscoped has more personality. It's Leno vs. Conan, and I know you don't have to ask which one has the personality....

       Pomp and Circumstance   There ought to be something about graduation. The house we live in now isn't any nicer than it was when we went to Commencement exercises yesterday, and the yard certainly doesn't have less dandilions growing and sending more seeds into the soil. Something big did happen, though, and although it's less climactic when you already have a full time job, there's still something magical about putting on the cap and gown and standing at the edge of life.   There are certain rote speeches that university officials are required to recite before sending graduates into the world. First, there's the "you oughta be grateful for the people who helped you get where you are" speech. Second, there's the "standing on the edge of the future, going into the world" speech. And finally, there is the "Please don't blow air horns into other people's ears" speech, the idea of which I definitely endorse. I mean, what do you think you're accomplishing by being one of seven people in an audience of 7,000 that happens to be cheering at a given moment. Is it the anticipation of hearing your own relative's or friend's or whatever's name read aloud in front of people, or is it just your way of fighting against the man?  Excuse the mild rant.   There is something to the whole event that made me feel all good inside, despite cliches. Perhaps it was when I got to see some of my dear Russian professors, who have taught me a lot about, well, Russian-related knowledge. Here is what I like about my Russian professors: they were always available to talk to in the office, and they have interest in ideas.  At least, there was never a time when I felt like they didn't care. That means a lot to me, and makes me respect them more and more.  The cliches work for my feelings right now; I feel like I should donate to the school, continue to learn even when I don't have a grade waiting for me, and always show gratitude to those who have helped me get where I am today.   I am grateful, and I do feel as though I have been blessed. I don't think it's commonplace to respect and truly enjoy 95% of a department's faculty. I enjoyed my time at BYU in large part thanks to them. I hope I can do a good job of thanking them. Cliche or not, that's what I have to do.   (Saturday, 12:12 am) Update: Here is a brief list of suggested improvements to the BYU graduation festivities:  1. Let students get their picture taken with a live cougar. Or just have a live cougar roam the Marriott Center during the ceremonies. 2. Assign half the audience to be shushers (that is, people who hiss "shhhhhhhhh!" whenever people cheer and clap) and half the audience to be cheerers. The cheerers have one second after each person's name is read, and the shushers have the next second. It would be more orderly that way.  3. Call people out of the audience to give a few words. About the speeches that were just given--instant feedback. 4. (Related to #3) Show people's reactions to different comments, like they do at the Academy Awards. 5. Have hot dog vendors

       Piano Lessons   So I found a piano teacher, and she's going to give me lessons starting on Tuesday. If I actually learn how to play, this will give me something to cross off the list of things to do before I die. I have always wanted to take lessons, and I think it's going to be worth it. How come more older people don't take lessons to learn how to play an instrument. Is it because there isn't time? Is it because people just don't care to know how to play?  Or is it because there isn't a good way to explain the action? I'm not sure, but I am super excited to learn how to play. I'll probably be less excited when it sinks in that I have to practice for the next five years to even be decent.

       Finding Yourself   I have a program,  urlLink Sharpreader , that takes all my news and the blogs I can possibly get my hands on, and puts all of it together to read. I have included my own blog in this list, to make sure that I am successfully doing the syndication feed. One result of this is that I will occasionally stumble on one of my own posts, and begin to get a strange deja vu feeling. In the next instant, I realize I am the author of the post. What follows that moment is similar to what happens when you walk into a room and are suddenly facing yourself in the mirror. I look for a moment, consider the synchronized movement, and then look away.

       The Boy Stanley   Well, we had the boy, and his name is Stanley David. Before I go any further, I should probably put in a picture:      He was born Monday morning at 1:12 am. Julie did a great job delivering him; she was glad to have the epidural, though she did well through the contractions that came before she was admitted to the hospital.  He has hair on his head! Julie and I were convinced he would be bald, but when he came out (and when they had cleaned the slime off his head), it was apparent that he indeed does have little tufts of hair, especially on the sides of his head.  Before he was born, I wondered what he would look like. Despite it being a cliche, once I saw him I realized that he looks just like what he should look like. That could be a function of the adaptation of my expectations immediately upon seeing him, but it just seems like he could not look any differently from what he looks like!  What a strange, awesome experience. He has been sleeping and eating and pooing ever since he was born. He happens to be sleeping right now. When he's hungry, he opens his mouth and twists around, as if there were a breast right there all the time, waiting for him to get hungry...Julie might contend, on second thought, that there  is  a breast (two, in fact) waiting for him to get hungry.

      XML RSS (and Atom) webfeeds coupled with an aggregator collectively is the TiVo (or digital video recorder, for you exacto knives) of the news world. The aggregation effect, and the interaction with the content saved, is very similar to the way in which I interact with my TiVo. For example, with my TiVo, I collect television shows that I watch at my leisure. Each show that has been recorded by TiVo contains a brief description of what it is, and I can modify the settings for each show--whether I would like to have it remain on the TiVo forever, whether I would like to delete it right then, or whether I would like the TiVo to take care of that for me based on the space available on the machine.  In the same way, my  urlLink Sharpreader  program collects headlines or entire posts from various feeds that I have determined. I can then peruse those posts/headlines at my leisure, deleting when I want or just letting the program manage that aspect of things.  This similarity gives rise to other comparable experiences with both the TiVo and my chosen aggregator. First, with both systems, I constantly have the sense that I am behind in my reading/watching. The shows and posts I thought I would want to ingest are simply too numerous for me to ever get through. Thus, although I still spend a whole lot of time reading the news (less time on the television, but still  some  time), I have a more acute sense of what I'm missing.  I used to look through CNN in about ten minutes and be pretty sure that I had a grasp of what had happened on a given day. Now, I feel like I'm using a cotton swab to take a sample of the beluga whale that is the news of every day. It's similar to when you do a  urlLink search on John Stamos  and you realize that this insignificant, B-list actor's name search yields a whopping 130,000 or so results. Does anyone care anymore that there is more information out there than we'll ever be able to consume? We're used to it with search, at least.  On the subject, though, did the news suddenly increase when I started using an aggregator? No. Did my familiarity with current events/thoughts/feelings/random stuff increase because I started using an aggregator, even if I feel overwhelmed during the process? Yes.  If I'm going to either watch television or read the news, it's advantageous for me to have TiVo and an aggregator. In both cases, my time spent doing those things is economized, and there has to be some value in knowing what you're missing--if only the humbling sense of not knowing a whole heck of a lot, compared to what's out there.

Hummer is a terrible car in my book, and I'm glad to see that people are coming off the high of owning a vehicle that is bigger than a house. I feel pity for people who buy them now, knowing that a) they bought a domestic car, which is enough of a risk; and b) they will likely regret the decision as time goes on. The one exception to this is the avid offroader who really loves taking his/her Hummer into the wilderness. Those people are at least making use of the huge power and military roots that come standard in these monsters.

       Day One of Seven: Old (Non-)Habits Die Hard?   Stanley settles down when you play him music of any kind. Right now we're listening to Dave Brubeck. In the category of "Things I Can't Justify Paying For, But Which I Gladly Pay For" is the  urlLink Rhapsody music service . Rhapsody provides thousands of albums for my listening pleasure, all for 9.95 a month. It's not a great price, but I do rationalize (notice I didn't use the term "justify") by the fact that if I were to purchase the albums that I listen to, I would spend thousands of dollars. This only costs 10 dollars a month.  The obvious retort to that would be, "Well, you wouldn't really buy those CD's, would you? It's not really a savings if you never would have bought it." That statement is true: I would not buy all the CD's I listen to through the Rhapsody service. But I wouldn't ever get the chance to listen to so much good music, either. This fact sort of brings it all full-circle. If I don't subscribe because it saves money, and I don't intend on buying the CD's, then why bother? Because I get to have that much music at my disposal, whenever I am at a computer (which ends up being 60+ hours a week--plenty of time to get my money's worth.) Not only that, but when I'm not at the computer, Julie can log into the service and listen to ABBA here at home.  ---------------------------  Stanley slept from about six until maybe nine o'clock tonight while we sat in the back yard on a blanket. I got some good pictures of his feet and head, which perhaps I'll be able to put on the site at some point. The batteries died during the photo shoot, so I'll have to recharge them before anything happens with the camera.  ---------------------------  I've been practicing the piano, and having an easy time with certain music, and tougher times with other music. Specifically, I was having a really hard time today making my left hand play a note with the middle finger while my right hand was playing a note with the pinky. It was something about the notes before that combination that was giving me fits, and I'm not sure why.  The highlight during practice today was when I was playing a song, "kaleidoscope", that is in my beginning jazz book. There's a chord progression that sounds, appropriately, pretty jazzy, and a couple times I managed to actually play the chords closely together, causing me to sound as though I could play the piano. It was the piano equivalent of hitting a great golf shot, in that it likely has the same effect of motivating me to continue participating in the game/hobby, even though I'm obviously not any good yet...  --------------------------------  It's a long post because I told myself I would write something today.  --------------------------------   My goal of a week without drinking any soda is complete. It was pretty easy, really, and I felt great. I'm not sure if I'm going to continue the habit (or lack thereof), but it was good for a week. Perhaps my next goal ought to be a post a day on this old blog? Maybe that would give an incentive to me to end this post sooner, since I won't worry that this is the last one until July or August. Okay, okay, stop twisting my arm, I'll post tomorrow, too! What--you were twisting my arm so that I'd stop the post? Oh, got it. My mistake. I'll get right on it.

      The first thing that should be said is there really isn't any Tic Tac besides the orange flavor. All the other Tic Tacs are no better than mints. But the orange! That is a different matter.  The second thing that should be said is there really isn't any way to eat Tic Tacs one at a time if they are orange. I eat one. Then I "carelessly" (that's the lie I tell myself) shake out five or six, and before my conscience has time to kick in, I toss all of them in my mouth. After that, it's always five or six, sometimes as many as ten. What a guilty flavorama.

I wonder how long it will take before there is a pretty good meeting point between the library and all its resources, and the search engine, with its amazing computing power. I liked the reference to the "Deep Web"--a web that "comes to the surface only as the result of a database query from within a particular site"   Here's a scary quote related to the Deep Web: "Some estimates put the number of Web pages that are hidden from the view of most search engines at 500 billion". As in 500,000,000,000.

       Take Me to Your Leaders, Captain and Teneille...    urlLink CNN.com - 616,00 signatures carried to Saturn by Cassini - Jul 1, 2004   I dunno. I really think it's cool when we send out communications that are intended to reach extraterrestrial life. And I guess signatures might strike a nerve with the alien life forms who have to sign the backs of their credit cards just like we do. But on a DVD? Are we assuming that aliens develop their technology at a similar rate? What are the chances that the aliens are going to have a DVD-compatible computer handy to read the things? Do we expect the aliens to print the signatures?  It seems like they're being redundant. Let's assume that the alien life form has received the DVD capable computer from the last time NASA sent a spacecraft into orbit (and sent the computer as a preparatory gift), and now they're going to play the DVD. Don't you think the aliens are going to already sense that there is some other life form out there, based on the  huge spacecraft that just landed on their house?  Maybe the computer they're using to read the DVD could be a little hint?  And as far as the DVD format goes, it seems sad to think that the odds grow even longer as the years go by that the signatures will be read by anyone, humans and aliens alike. I wonder if NASA ever included in their spacecrafts 8-track tapes with people introducing themselves and the human race.  Meanwhile, other life forms from far, far away are wondering when we're going to see those huge flaming balls of ice, gas, and rock that they keep sending across and around our solar system every so often. Little do they know, we don't have a computer that's compatible with that format yet.

      Alright, so Alan goes and challenges me with his "I have a post more recent than you." What else can I do but start posting to my blog again? Stanley is great, arching his back and getting mad during the day, but sleeping pretty well at night. He makes eye contact and coos. He smiles and seems to enjoy contact with us. I feel like the King of Spain whenever we have a little cooing conversation, regardless of how silly I undoubtedly look when I'm leaning over him, making cheesy smiley faces at him and emitting falsetto chirps.

      I need to be a little more gaunt, now that you mention it. I've long had a desire to be one of those enviable types of people that runs every day or at least consistently, but I haven't. I have run three marathons, but training for those marathons were the only times where I actually ran consistently, and then it was tough. Why aren't scientists looking for the consistency gene?

      Stanley, my son,  learned a new trick today. From lying on his stomach, he pushed himself up on his hands until his head and most of his chest were off the ground. Then, he leaned to the right and let the disproportionate weight of his noggin' turn him over! It was quite a cool thing to see. He's a week shy of three months old, so it's not phenomenal, but it's cool to see. I guess we'll have to start really watching where we put him so he doesn't fall off. Like the roof of the car. And the roof of our house.

      Golf is a tricky game. I have come to the realization that if I want to be a bad golfer the rest of my life, the best way to do that is to just play a couple of rounds a week. If the last couple months are any indication, this will guarantee not only mediocrity, but perhaps more ineptitude as time goes by. This promises to be a rewarding way to spend five or six hours a week (or more).  Can you feel the frustration? Well, it's more like a resignation to a given course of action, since I really do want to become good at golf, and so I am going to practice more. But it's so clear that it hurts sometimes. I went and played a couple holes of golf today, thinking I might get some practice, and I did. The problem was, I could have done the same thing in half the time by not even bothering to go out on the course. But playing the official course is always a temptation.  This post isn't very interesting.
