       Mood:  "meh" and *cold*  oh lordy... where do begin... well yesterday i was at my gram's for a mini BBQ w/my uncle and 3 cousins and my family... it was all good until chuckles, gigi and i wanted to play Scrabble... and we found the new board my gram got for her birthday...  BAD BAD BAD  idea!!!!!... she totally flipped on us... i'd never seen my gram taht angry... except for the time we were jumping on the beds upstairs... so we cleaned it up and found the old blue board, which we are now and forever allowed to use whenever... the three of us felt like real brats, so we wrote her a apology card and she was all gram-jovial and said "it's ok, you can use this blue one from now on"... i love my grammie and i'm very sorry and embarassed... ::sigh::  soo... then we went to visit my grampa's grave... it was so sad... there's no headstone yet, but it's coming down from Rhode Island soon... RI granite... we all miss him...  when i got home i talked to JOHNNY MAC and we had a nice long convo... lovely... then i got kicked offline... whoops...  now i hafta either do HW or play PS2 w/ Joey... decisions decisions... buhbye now!!

       Mood:  frenched-out  ya but not in the "i've been french-kissed too much", but rather the " ispent the day at Devin's parlez-ing francais... o lala   woah this weekend has been really KICKASS so far... yesterday was one of the most fun days ever! i was at the mall w/ gongfellow, krista, and lizmo... we saw " The Day After Tomorrow" which was tres tres freaky... then we bumped into tessa and devin and kerri and amy... it was fun... we invaded B&N and OMG I SEARCHED FOR THE ACCENT BOOK AND IT WAS GONE!!!!!  i am tres triste about that... then we ate and saw "Shrek 2" which was absolutely hysterical... i sat next to gong and she was laughing so loud, it was sooo funny...  then we went to H&M and some other lovely places and then home again home again jiggety jig...  the highlight (or one of them, there were a number of them) was finding the credit card in the parking lot outside Target and then returning it like 4 good citizens should... but when we gave it to the security guy,  he asked us if we'd used it!!   hello  if i had used the damn thing i wouldn't exactly tell you, dumbass... jeeze   so today i went to devin's and we were studying for the speaking part of the french regents... fun... it was great to talk to devin b/c she's so sweet and she is a great listener... *yay*  i hafta go eat pizza... yum!!  p.s.-  HAPPY 18th BIRTHDAY MARK!!!

       Mood:  Amazed!!!!!  Hooray!!! Oh man that ring ceremony was kickass!!!!  ok so here we go: i went to Touring Choir at 5 so i could practice my NYSSMA solo w/ Ms. Santillo... but, as it is with her quite often, there was not much time for me... but Joefi sounded great... anyhoo, i went to TC and sang my little alto brain out... then i met my mom in then main foyer... we went down to the annex cafe. and found a seat (a spot at a table, right in the front)...   ok so they did the whole "here are you class co-presidents" and "here's your new assist. principal" thing and then the Jostens guy came up and did his whole deal... ya the whole keeping track of how many people turn you ring etc. isn't going to happen with me... ok and then he told us about the "special prize": you get your ring basically paid for, like cash back to you right there... ok so there we (me and my mom) were, waiting to see my ring-a-ding-doo... i was a alittle pissed b/c my name was at the end of the alphabet, but they weren't really going in order...they called me up and gave me my box and stuff and i was kinda trying not to think of just how badly i had to pee... so we sat down and opened the boxes on the count of 3 and blah blah blah  so we were all hot-dogging about the rings, and the guy said "ok, time to draw the name for the prize"... he made all of us stand and he was like "everyone with the last initials S-Z, sit down" and i thought  damn i didn't win... sucks for me  ... he kept doing the whole, sit down blahblah till there are like 5 people left: danielle, marissa, alison,a and two other people i didn't know... and he said "ok the winner is:   Ruth Tra-vay-doe " and i'm thinking  oh hell he said my name wrong  and then i was like "WHAT?!" danielle said i said that kinda loud and it echoed... and my mom said i turned red as a beet... i could feel the heat in my face... cray-zay... so i got up and i was saying to myself "well, i won, but he said my name wrong and i hafta pee like a racehorse and i'm very hot and i have a pencil in my hair" ... and the jostens lady and the guy gave me like $200... IT WAS FABULOUS!!!!  my mom gave it all back to me b/c i paid the last $100 from "my sixteenth birthday fund" and didn't complain about it... so now i have double what  I  paid for...   then we went to Hoyers to celebrate... i got a strawberry soft serve w/ rainbow sprinkles b/c it is SOO pretty...  so i think my ring has been turned by danielle (1st), amy, alyssa, jessica, ms. sassone, the new asst. principal, and that's all i remember  ah... so now i'm gonna take a shower...    la vie est belle, non?

       Mood: bored  ok the title for this post was made possible by the constant commercials for "Sex and the City" on TBS... but i keep thinking about it... if you had the chance to go back in time and re-live a specific point in time (be it a year, a day, an hour), would you want to do it?  there are several times i wish i could go back an re-live... there are even times i wish i could go back and re-do things... or just change a few moments... this year was seriously one of the best and i wish i could go back and re-live the straight play... that was honestly one of the best couple of months i've ever lived... i wish i could go back and react to certain things in a more mature way... i thought that was something interesting to ponder...   I wish the class of 2004 much luck, love and happiness... hopefully you are satisfied with the way you handled high school... you will be greatly missed, even if you plan on frequently coming back for visits... *mwah*~~

       Mood:   RELIEVED   i think i should start recapping the weekend from Friday... hokay here we go   Friday  was my Dad's birthday... i got home and baked a cake after trying to get a hold of ms. santillo at school to get my NYSSMA time... so yes, i baked a chocolate cake and the bottom was falling off so i had my mom move it onto the cake dish... then i frosted it (chocolate) and decorated it... yay! then dad came home and we went ot Gilligan's, the best kep secret of the area!! i'm definately a turf girl, but this place is soo awesome... their chicken labobs are killer!...   BUT OMG THE HORROR OF THE NIGHT was when i chipped my tooth while eating my salad... and it  wasn't  something in the salad that caused me to do it, but i did it to myself while chewing... and now my teeth have a blemish... boo hoo...   and then the freakiest thing happened... we were sitting there and this man passed by our table... i looked at him for a few seconds and realized how much he resembled my grampa... later on  he came up to us and asked us is we were Trovatos  ... needless to say we were freaked... he turned out to be a Trovato too and told us he'd seen our name in the phone book... it was so weird! he told us about the name "Trovato": it means "found" (we knew that) and it came from the fact that we were originally orphans who were in Sicily, but could have come from Greece and we were "found"... it was sooo ridiculously freaky...    Saturday  was NYSSMA in Minisink Valley HS... which is in the middle of frigging nowhere... heneeway... got there, nearly peed my pants and threw up from nerves... i practiced with the other girls for a while and then went in to do my solo... i was ok... not the best... the judge had me "lift" the piano to get my abs working b/c my voice isn't develloped... and then omg sightreading should DIE!!!! EVIL EVIL EVIL SHITE!!! when i was dome the judge was like "well at least you ended up on the right 'Do'" and i walked out with watery eyes... so my mom and i left... Ms. Santillo left a message on the machine telling me that i got a  96 ... YAHOO!!  the we saw  HARRY POTTER  !!!! it was awesome!!!!! they left out some stuff but what can ya do? it was soo good omg sirius black is my fave character in the whole HP series ::tear::... the only thing that blemished my movie experience was two jerk boys making fart noises in back of me the ENTIRE time... i was really ready to yell at them... but i held back because i was afraid of missing something... oh no wait the other thing that bugged me was my brother asking me questions about the plot while it was happening... ahh!!! anyway it was such a fabulous movie, but you should read the book!! it's so much better!!  and today i cleaned a little: vacuumed the living room and my room and made a new poster thingy with a quote from the book "Peter Pan"... I'll leave y'all with the quote... bye!: ~~ "I say, Wendy," he whispered to her,"always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying,'I'm Wendy,' and then I'll remember."

       Mood: pooped~!  i am sooo tired, man... so since last saturday, i started staff training at CAB... very cool, but very weird... i still can't bring myself to call Skittles "Allie"... man it's so funny... i won't re-cap the whole week, but yesterday, we hiked to  The Timp !! ah! no it was fun, but very hot... then we made food and had a Girl Scouts' Own...   and then the ex-CIT's chilled with Skittles, Chip, Nemo, NurseJenni, Jax, and a few others stayed up by the campfire for   5 HOURS    ... i sat on a log for 5 hours!! ahhh!!! but since i took an oath, i must say that  what happened in the fire circle stayed in the fire circle ... and my brain heehee... all i will say is that i see g-bread in a new light, Nemo had guts, and Jenni is a dirty saxy beach...  AHHH I:M MISSING JEOPARDY!!!!!!!!

       Mood:  tiawed  oh my... i never blog anymore... but that doesn't mean that i will stop... i know how much all my adoring fans love reading my thoughts...  so today i have to do the water drill at camp... ah nothing sounds more fun than sweeping the swimming area at CAB for a bleach bottle corpse...  i had all this good stuff to write about and now i can't think because i have just looked at the clock... it is screaming 8:00 and i leave the casa at 8:30...  so here i sit in my jammies (the  purple  "frog prince" pants and my salmon-ish Nantasket beach tee-shirt... in case you wanted a visual... dirty skanks) waiting for inspiration... alas i can find none  ok au revoir fellow freaks....
