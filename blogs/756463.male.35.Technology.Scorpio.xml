       Well, I did a little checking up on this Robert Evans guy, and apparently he's a real referee, and pretty high up in the FIFA referee rankings.  So if the document from a couple days ago is by him then it needs to be taken seriously.      Justice is done   Los Angeles beat the New England Revolution yesterday in the MLS Cup final, and thank goodness.  As much as I dislike the Galaxy and their &uuml;ber-whiner Cobi Jones, anything is better than a team that plays like the Revolution.  You've seen my comments there, of course.    The one thing that I absolutely loved, though, about the Galaxy win, was the look of sheer joy on the face of Carlos Ruiz after he put the winning goal past Adin Brown in overtime.  Too often in this league, the foreign players don't seem to be taking the whole thing seriously, like MLS is just something to do to get out of wherever they were playing before.  But the look on Ruiz's face was one of the sheerest outpourings of emotion I've ever seen on an athlete's face... and this was for a U.S. soccer final!  It is SO nice to see the foreigners take this stuff seriously here... big kudos to Ruiz and the Galaxy.    Granted, I hope he doesn't continue that look at Crew Stadium on Thursday when the Crew takes the Galaxy on in the U.S. Open Cup finals, because the Crew needs to win their first trophy!

      Interesting that I wrote that last Blog entry on the referees' inability to control a game... now it's beginning to appear as though they're not being given the chance to control a game.  Please read this article by  Robert Evans , reportedly a long-time FIFA Referee and Referee Instructor.  The name "Bob Evans" gives me pause, though there's not any reason in the world that a person couldn't actually have that name.  Read it yet?  Good.  I'll continue.  A sport is nothing without its rules, and more specifically the un-biased and fair interpretation and execution of those rules.  And if this is true, MLS has been bending the rules to benefit the bottom line, supposedly.  Here's a quote:   Major League Soccer is encouraging and instructing referees to violate the Laws of the Game. The motivation for this appears to be an attempt to eliminate controversial decisions, and to protect star players from disciplinary action that would normally be taken by a referee fulfilling his/her duty to the game.    First of all... how do not calling back-tackles, denial of goal-scoring opportunities, modification of the offside rule to benefit the defenders, removal of key extra time, not handing out cards for dissent, allowing play to continue when the ball strikes an official, and not handing out second yellow cards even when deserved eliminate controversial decisions?    Newsflash for MLS:  The fans know this game.  You're not pulling in many non-soccer fans, what you're doing is you're attracting soccer fans who up till now haven't been paying attention to the domestic league.  These folks are watching the English or other European/South American leagues and only occasionally coming to an MLS game.  And the fans who have watched it all along also watched foreign and international play before watching MLS.  They KNOW what a call is and they KNOW how it should be called.  You're creating more controversy by having your refs not call penalties and distribute cards like they're supposed to do.    And protecting star players?  Why are these players protected more than anyone else?  How did they become star players in the first place?  By coming up through the ranks and making a name for themselves in the league.  So as soon as MLS deems them a star player, suddenly they're immune to the rules of the game?  What about that other player who got a penalty because of his actions against a star player, or as usually happens DIDN'T get a call because they were fouled by a "star" player?  He might be a star of the future... but if you keep holding the current stars up to a different standard than the players who are up-and-coming, you eliminate the future stars.  And you also push fans away from the game.  We're not dumb, MLS.  We know how this game is supposed to be played.

       Well, another MLS Cup Semifinal round has come and gone for the Crew, and the Black and Gold return home empty again.  This is an old story for Crew fans, who have been to three different MLS Cup Semifinal series and have come up short each time.  So why is it that this one hurts just a tad more than the infamous DC United series of the late 1990s?  Perhaps it's because this time we were the better team on the field.     Warning - for those of you who rankle at the columns of a certain Paul Gardner, you may want to avert your eyes from this column because it's going to be full of opinions about what is "good" soccer and what is "crap" soccer.  You have been warned.   Throughout the first two games, I had all sorts of folks telling me that there was a conspiracy against the Crew - that MLS wanted the Revs to win to ensure a home-field team being in the final.  And honestly, I have no problem with that.  MLS is a struggling league and a high ticket sales count for the Championship game would certainly be a wonderful thing, revenue-wise.  The league management can want as much as they can get...   As long as that's as far as it goes.   However...  there were at least FOUR separate occurrences of fouls in the New England box that should have resulted in penalty kicks, two in the second game and two in the third.  I watched Carlos Llamosa stand in front of Dante Washington and hold him away from getting to a ball, with referee Kevin Stott standing there watching.  I saw time-wasting, faked injuries, pissing and moaning around, and never once did I see an actual call made to yellow card the Revs for their actions in these games.    This is why MLS fans hate the referees so much.  They have no concept of controlling a game to make the teams actually play soccer.  All these tactics are the kind of stuff that over-competitive kids' travel team coaches pull to win in tournaments (to the detriment of their players development).  And any referee worth his salt should see this and make the appropriate calls and keep the game moving.  Get the stretchers out on the field and get the "injured" players off.  Card players who consistently waste time getting the ball into play on free kicks and throw-ins.  Card players for dissent when they pick up the ball on an opponent's free kick and walk off with it.  This is NOT soccer... this is acting and unsportsmanlike.  There's nothing wrong with playing to slow the tempo of a game down.  It makes for boring soccer, that's for sure, but it's legal and sportsmanlike.  Lots of passing through the back, perhaps some probing forward to keep the other team honest and spread out, that's fine.  A defensive game like the Kansas City Wizards played in the 2000 MLS Cup game against the Chicago Fire was actually fairly entertaining... the talented and quick KC defenders were simply well-organized and collapsed on the ball well.  But it was tactically sound and never once relied on cheap histrionics and piddly time-wasting to get the job done.    The difference here, though, between the 2000 Wizards and the 2002 Revolution?  Talent.  The Revs have nearly NONE on their team.  I'll admit, you can't deny Taylor Twellman is a goal scorer extraordinaire, and Adin Brown had a wonderful series (until the Crew found the back of the net too late in Game 3).  But that's pretty much where it ends.  The rest of the Revs team was a crying, cheap-shot, holding, clutching, cheap-tackling, and unsportsmanlike bunch of babies.  Normally when it comes to the finals, I cheer for whatever team knocked the Crew out of the playoffs.  I like to think that it took the top team to take down the Crew.  But this year, I'll be cheering for the L.A. Galaxy.  Because the Revs won the MLS Semifinals not by playing soccer, but by doing everything they could to avoid playing quality ball against a quality attacking team.

       It's long past time that I got back on track with this blog.  So here we go.  Last Friday, I sat in front of my PC here at work and entered information onto the Matchnight.com database on the MLS SuperDraft.  Three things happened as a result of this event, as far as I'm concerned.     Major League Soccer pulled some very good players into the league, as well as some whose value will probably be questionable.  Matchnight.com and MLSNet.com were both dragged to a near standstill by the people who were trying to access them to get draft information.  Very frustrating and very encouraging at the same time.  The importance of the internet for American Soccer fans has been perfectly displayed by event Number Two.    One of the big criticisms I have of the Columbus Crew is that the website is generally the last to get informed about the big news happening in Crew-dom.  Preference on story notification is given to the Columbus Dispatch and whatever TV stations have deigned the story at hand worthy to cover.  Meanwhile, the internet, which most Crew fans use to get their information about the team, is treated as a low man on the totem pole.  We get the information last - whenever the Crew decides they can get around to us.    And that's just wrong.  We need to be current about all Crew news before any other media outlet is, if at all possible.  How does it look when the Dispatch is covering a story that we haven't posted yet because they haven't sent us the press release?  Bad.  And we've fielded complaints about that at many times.  And we've told the Crew this many times.  But for some reason, they just continually treat us as a second-rate source.  And treating your own media outlet as a second-rate source is never good.

      I've recently joined a new group called  urlLink ARMA - the Association for Rennaissance Martial Arts .  They are a group that is looking to recreate the warrior skills of medieval and rennaissance Europe, with particular attention to swordsmanship.  And so far they seem like one of the most interesting bunch of folks I've ever run into.    My major problem with most martial arts studios is that there isn't much room to experiment and develop - you go in, you learn a prescribed set of skills, and you're graded (Sort of like school, which I'm also not a big fan of).  And many of them are so dogmatic in their approach that to ever question things is some sort of traitorous behavior.    But ARMA is trying to recreate skills that are long-gone.  And they are doing this by consulting the existing historical manuals of fencing and combat - the actual works from those ages past.  These  Fechtbuecher  or "fighting books" from the German, cover a wide variety of weapons and such.  They are of varying quality, of course - some of that old medieval art is hard to decipher because they didn't have the same sort of anatomical study behind them as later art (such as that from the rennaissance) in many cases.    But the people in ARMA are a very diverse lot.  There are some strict scholars, who have studied swords and written about them.  There are professional law-enforcement and military personnel.  There are life-long martial artists.  And there are lots of just plain history buffs (like myself) who are fascinated by the entire idea of truly re-creating history.  These folks are smart, athletic, and realize that there is a place for exercising both the mind and the body.    And most importantly, they're all learning together.  If someone comes across something in a manual that makes you think a certain way and it's not what other folks in the group have learned or come to think, it's looked at seriously and taken into careful consideration.  This is as opposed to ideas being quickly dismissed because of some pre-conceived dogma about the art, as I've seen in a the few asian martial arts I've taken.    I honestly can't think of a more productive way to exercise both mind and body than such a group.  We're all learning together, and our learning is being translated directly into our martial arts.  How cool is that?

      Well, now that I live in a house in an actual neighborhood and not an apartment, I have a few things to say on the subjects of sidewalks.  I was raised in a neighborhood where, after it snowed, you went out and shoveled the snow off the stretch of sidewalk that was in front of your house.  It's that simple.  If you have snow on your walks, the mailman and other pedestrians can't get through or might hurt themselves.  It's also just you doing your bit of neighborhood duty.    But since I moved to  urlLink Clintonville , I've noticed that not everyone feels this way.  In fact, it appears to be completely fine to just not do it at all, and let people fall over and hurt themselves.  Like my wife.  My wife fell and hurt her tailbone a couple of weeks ago and she was in a lot of pain.  In Michigan, she could legitimately have sued the person whose walk it was.    I don't know if that's how it is here or not... I'm new to this whole house thing.  But I can't imagine that this sort of thing is permissable!    So folks... if your walks have snow on them, remove it.  ALL OF IT.  Not that one little sweep through with the snowblower or shovel to make that path that only tightrope walkers can make it through.  Remove it ALL.  Be considerate of those people around you and maybe they'll be considerate to you.

       Oh... this was fun.     Whenever I see a diving crap team come into Crew Stadium I want to throttle them - diving and such histrionics are everything that is wrong with soccer. So to watch the Crew run roughshod over such a team (two goals by Edson Buddle with assists by Brian McBride and a goal off a flubbed DAU free kick by Kyle Martino) was pure bliss for me.     DAU had a one-goal aggregate lead going into this game based on a similar game in Panama and were obviously coming out to bunker in and not let anyone score.  So... you'd think that when the Crew tied it up, they'd stop bunkering, wouldn't you?     Nope.  This team was an embarrassment to the country of Panama.  The fact that we lost down there should be (and was, according to Buddle) embarrassing to the Crew, because Deportivo Arabe Unido was simply a bad team.  They had some good players, and it's a shame they play the way they did, because they could have been really good.  But instead they flopped around like a salmon on the shore of the Columbia River, waiting to be eaten by a bear.  And that bear was Columbus.

      The Crew plays this Sunday in the  urlLink CONCACAF Champions Cup , against Deportivo Arabe Unido of Panama.  This competition is the premier Club competition in North America and for the first time the Crew gets to play in it, on the basis of their winning the 2002 U.S. Open Cup.    The first leg is in Panama, but the next leg, on March 23rd, is right here - IN COLUMBUS, OHIO!  Crew fans - MAKE SURE YOU COME OUT FOR THIS GAME!  This is the biggest competition that America's Hardest Working Team has ever been involved in.  Judging by the number of folks who showed up to the U.S. Open Cup Final at Crew Stadium, there isn't a heck of a lot of knowledge about such competitions and how important they are.  This was obvious when the Crew won its first title ever and only about 6000 folks showed up to watch.  It was a good loud crowd, of course, but it also showed how many fair-weather Crew fans there are.  It was cold that night but both teams played their hearts out and it was a great result for a deserving team.    This international competition needs to be well-attended.  The Revolution, another team involved in the competition, has basically forfeited the first round by opting to play both their home and away legs at their Costa Rican opponents stadium.  That's asinine, of course, but if MLS teams don't see that there's a financial benefit to playing these games at home, then they're not going to do it.  And international competition is what soccer is all about.

      Been months since I did anything with this blog, but I'm adding to it today.     urlLink According to an AP article , the Vatican has just started a campaign AGAINST gay marriage.  Pardon me for the language, but who the hell do they think they are?  How can a body made up of people who have NO idea what marriage really means make choices for the rest of us who actually CAN and DO get married?    Marriage is a bond between two people who love each other and want to support each other for the rest of their lives.  How is THAT a sin?  Who cares if they're straight or gay?  The day I got married was the happiest of my life.  Who is the Vatican, whose ruling body can't get married at all, to say that someone can't enjoy that same happiness because of some stupid rule?    Suffice to say, I will never step into a Catholic Church again (barring a funeral or some stuff).  I'm done with them.  This is the one that pushed me over the edge.

      Another year is ending and it's time for me to give my thoughts (I'm good at that):      Marriage rules.  I love my wife more now than the day we were married.  Having someone to share life with makes things so much more pleasant and fulfilling.  And I'm lucky as hell to have found someone who shares so much with me.     President Bush needs to go.  I'm a big Dean supporter, but I'll take just about ANYONE over him as long as the new president isn't a holier-than-thou conservative christian like our current moron.  I've never hated a political figure as much in my life.  This guy not only needs to be defeated, he needs to be indicted.     I love ARMA.  Being a member of such a great martial arts society has given me something that is hard to explain - but suffice to say I enjoy being part of a community that accepts everyone from every walk of life, as long as they're training and learning and trying to add to the whole.  I've never met a group like this before and I probably never will.   The Columbus Crew are still my favorite soccer team, but they need help.  The Brian Dunseth/Mark Williams move was a fiasco, injuries plagued us, and coaching was substandard without Oscar Pisano in there to charge things up.  Also, the staff needs to be more forthcoming with information.  TheCrew.com is a joke when we're the last spot on earth to release stories about our own team.      That's about it.  I'll try to post more regularly.

      Okay... it's been several months since the War in Iraq officially ended (though no one seems to have told the "enemy").  And I think it's finally okay for me to ask this question:    What exactly does it mean when people say "I support the troops?"  I mean, I hope they don't get killed or wounded.  I hope they come back home safely.  I've sent care packages to them.  I hope their families are well-taken care of.  I let people know when the government isn't doing what it should be doing to support them, such as our president trying to reduce their hazardous duty pay or removing the benefits that families of soldiers in hazardous duty get.  Is that what it means to support the troops?    Because I see a lot of people driving around with their "Support the Troops" signs and American flags on their cars, and I wonder - what exactly are THEY doing to support the troops?    It seems to me it's a lot of backlash from the Vietnam era, where you heard the stories about soldiers' poor treatment upon coming home.  I can understand making note that the war itself isn't the troops' fault.  It's the government's fault.  And taking frustrations out on the soldiers doing the fighting is the wrong and immoral way to go.  Reminding folks of that isn't a bad thing.    But is that what's happening here?

      This morning, as every morning, I reached Neil Avenue on my way to work (after getting off the bus, so I was walking).  And, this morning, as every morning, I sat and watched in silent amusement and partial annoyance at the idiot college student who stood watching both ways in rapt attention to cross the street against the light.  And of course, when the light did change, he wasn't paying attention to it so I walked right past him into the crosswalk.    Even better, yesterday I watched a kid try to cross against the light, forcing the oncoming car to slow down.  Then they did that little dance where one starts to go just as the other starts to go, etc.  All this while the walk light was on "Don't Walk."  Finally, he just went.  And about 2 seconds later the light turned to "Walk."    Folks... what the HELL is so hard about waiting 30 seconds to cross with the light?

      Following all the stuff lately about the non-existent Weapons of Mass Destruction has made me giggle.  Massive props to the CIA head George Tenet for saying publicly that our lying chief executive is continuing his ways.    I'm not deluded enough to believe that the Republican Congress is going to allow him to be impeached, much less indicted.  But hopefully history will show that this loser never had any business being in the White House.  I'm not saying Al Gore would have been perfect (though I'm sure he wouldn't have raped the environment like the Bush Administration has) but he certainly would have been better than the pretender on the throne.

      Jenn and I were out walking our dogs Brandy and Guinness this morning, and we saw a guy at the park who was walking his dog from his CAR.  The dog was walking around outside the car as he drove down the park's road.     He could have run his dog over.   If something happened to the dog, like another dog or a raccoon attacking it, he wouldn't have been able to do anything.     If he was watching the dog, he wasn't watching the road.   Next time I see this bastard, I'll post his license plate number.  Anyone in Columbus, feel free to egg his car.

      First, there was  Talk Like A Pirate Day  which I totally support, and now they've come up with  No Pants Day!   Apparently this year it's May 7th.  I suppose... run out and take off your pants on that day.     urlLink No Pants Day.com  has a quiz that tells you what you should be wearing on this august day (not AUGUST... it's in May).  Here's what I got... not sure I'm ready for that.                         You Should Wear Your Girlfriend's Panties!

      Just read an editorial (if you can call an opinionated sports article an "editorial") today about how the NCAA basketball tournament captures the spirit of America more than any other sporting event.  I beg to differ.    Perhaps it doesn't have the same attraction because of what sport it is, but I think the U.S. Open Cup has more of an all-American feel to it than the NCAAs.  Let me explain...  The NCAA tournament is made up of college teams.  PERIOD.  No exceptions to that rule.  Therefore, anyone playing on these teams was probably recruited for their playing ability to play at a University, where their needs are taken care of via scholarships.    Let's look at the makeup of most American soccer teams.  Now, I'm not talking about MLS here (though some of what I'm about to say applies to players there, too).  American soccer players are, for the most part, semi-professional players at best.  Your typical A-League, D3 League, etc. player has to have another job at the very least just to make ends meet.  Soccer is played because it's a passion, a love for the sport.  Some of these guys put their lives on hold for the chance to play soccer at a high level.    Second, let's look at the leagues themselves.  MLS and the A-League are full-fledged professional leagues, though they certainly don't make any where near the money of the big four sports.  The D3 League is semi-professional.  The PDL is made up of college students who need teams to play on in their college offseasons (to a large extent).  And then there are the amateur teams, which can be anything from a bar team to a team made up of immigrants to group of pals who play in a city league.  Any of these teams can take place in the U.S. Open Cup - as long as they're good enough and can get into an entry tournament of some kind.    Third, let's look at the sports themselves.  By and large, basketball players have to be tall.  If you're not a tall hoopster, and that's rare, then you need some other skill to fall back on to survive your scholarship.  But soccer players can come in all sizes - towering defenders, nimble midfielders, rough and hard-charging wingers, speedy opportunistic forwards, or any number of combinations thereof.  Jon Busch, goalkeeper for the Columbus Crew, is one of the better keepers in that league yet stands a whole 5' 10" in a position normally reserved for the giants of the league.  Mamadou Diallo, a former leading scorer in MLS, was a monster player at forward, where you usually have smaller, faster guys.  And the variations go on.    That's the beauty of soccer - it doesn't matter how big or small  you are, it's how you play the game.  If you can do something special with the body you've been given, you'll be a success.  And that's what America is all about - doing what you can with what you have.    If that's not the American spirit at its best, I don't know what is.

      You'd never think that four words could have so huge an impact on your life as to change your outlook completely, but they can.    "We're having a baby."    My wife Jennifer hadn't been feeling particularly well the past couple weeks, and after a friend of ours reported that she was pregnant, that started Jenn thinking.  So... she stopped at the drug store, picked up a little test, and BINGO - our lives are changed forever.    Obviously, we've done the doctor thing at this point so we know it's for sure, but I'm still reeling from the news that I'm going to be a dad.  It's been fun telling folks, but at the same time it's very intimidating to realize that this time next year I'm going to be helping to take care of a new life, a life that's going to be relying on me for pretty much everything.    Tends to sober you up quite a bit, eh?

      Been about a month since I posted here, just saw something that made me laugh out loud.    Some organization called "The American Family Association" sent me a request to be polled, so I did.  It was a presidential poll, with John Kerry, Ralph Nader, and the Great Pretender on the list of possibilities.  So, naturally, I responded with John Kerry as I plan to vote for him and get the Shrub out of office.  After the poll was over, I got the results thus far.    John Kerry:  90.05% George Bush:  3.64% Ralph Nader:  6.32%  Smiling, I thought "You know, I don't even know who the American Family Association is."  So I checked out their website... they're a right-wing freak-job bunch - with issues on their site like "The Homosexual Agenda" and "Church In America."   I hope they look at these results they're getting and cry like babies.

      Read an article on Yahoo this morning from Reuters about the movie  Godsend , which is apparently about human cloning.  They did a pretty clever marketing technique with the movie's website, in that they created a website for a "Cloning Clinic" with links to the movie's webpage.    The  urlLink article is here , and the  urlLink clinic's website is here .    Apparently, there are people calling for this website to be shut down because it's too controversial.  Folks, just read what's there and poke around, and you'll discover that it's for the movie!  I found eight or so links to the movie on the FRONT PAGE ALONE.    There are also some folks who are upset because they think the site is insensitive to those who've lost a loved one.  Well, you know, there are always going to be things that remind us of times of sorrow.  The only way to get over such things is to deal with the sorrow and move on.  I've had sorrow in my life, and I've dealt with it and moved on.  Most people do.  If you CAN'T get over it alone, then find help.    Finally - let's look at first amendment rights.  There is NOTHING that says people have a right not to be offended.  If anything, people specifically do NOT have that right.  The right to free speech and freedom of expression precludes that, without a doubt.  I may not like to hear some moron ranting about how the environment is fine, but he has the right to say it.  I then have the right to point out what an brainless prat he is, naturally.    It's JUST a website for a movie.  Deal with it.

      Another sign that America is getting too lazy:  They actually make briefcases with rollers now - in case your BRIEFCASE is too heavy.    Ladies and gentlemen, the day your briefcase is too heavy is the day you need to head back into the gym or at least do some pushups.    I'll get you started.  Order the book "Combat Conditioning" from this guy:   urlLink Matt Furey .  For those of you who want to get REALLY fit, and I'm not just talking lifting weights and getting big, cosmetic muscles, but actually STRONGER, buy this guy's stuff.  And follow his program.  I'm doing it and I've never felt better.

      I'm a bus rider.  I like not having to worry about parking, traffic, stupid drivers, etc.  I like having time to just sit on the way to work, read a book or magazine, what have you.    But one thing I can't stand is (I'm sure you've guessed it) rude people.    There's not a lot of room on a bus - they try to make them fit as many people as possible, for obvious reasons.  So when I'm sitting in an outside seat and I have to get off, the person sitting on the inside seat should stand up and get out of the way so I can do so, right?    Apparently not.  Too often I get stuck with that person who just pulls their knees up or scoots to the side.  I'm tempted to brush my ass in their face as I go by sometimes, just so they get the idea.

      Well, 'tis a sad day in TV land.  Not quite as sad as when Fox cancelled  John Doe , but still very sad.  Friends is going off the air.  And, of course, all people can talk about is what's going to happen with Ross and Rachel.    Am I alone in the world of Friends' fans in that I couldn't care LESS what happens to Ross?  I was seriously hoping for Rachel and Joey to get together, or hell, even Rachel and Phoebe.  Ross annoys the living piss out of me.  If he was someone I ran into at work, I'd probably hate his guts.  But no, America's all agog about the possibility of Ross and Rachel getting together finally, and you know that NBC isn't going to do something smart like let Ross get run over by a bus or something.    Well, as much as I'll miss Chandler and Joey, I guess it's okay for Friends to be ending.  The show has pretty much done all it can, and they've done it with class, style, and some pretty great comedy.    Now  John Doe , on the other hand...

      For the last two work days, I've been going to OSU's Larkins Hall at lunch to work out.  It's amazing how much better you feel when you do some real work during the day - not just sitting at a desk.    Larkins has a big wrestling room (luckily it doesn't SMELL like your typical wrestling room) with a thick mat so I can do all my Combat Conditioning exercises without having to move around too much.  It also has a rope to climb and pullup bars.  Heck, what else does a bodyweight exerciser need?    Felt good to do some wall walkers - I did ten today and actually got my chest to touch the wall a couple times near the end.  Naturally, that's not all I did - threw in some Hindu Squats and Jumper Squats, plenty of Hindu Pushups, and some other ab and back exercises.    Looking forward to continuing this habit...

      Read a little blurb today on  urlLink Matchnight.com's  Dallas Burn affiliate,  urlLink the 3rd Degree .  Apparently, the Burn wants to change their name, and they're changing it to the bland "FC Dallas."    I have BIG issues with this.    Soccer is a sport that, around the world, every country has made their own and in their own way.  Look at the Salsa Soccer of Brazil, or the Reggae Boyz of Jamaica.  And in the U.S., we have Sam's Army and MLS.    Now let's look at sports traditions in the U.S.  American sports teams have nicknames, traditionally.  Would the New York Yankees be the same if they were the New York BC?  Or the Boston Celtics as Boston BC?  Or the Detroit Redwings as Detroit HC?  No.  And MLS teams shouldn't be any different.  They have nicknames... keep 'em.  Or, if you're going to change them, look at what San Jose did.  Go with a name that has some history to it, as they did when they changed from the Clash to the Earthquakes, the name of the old San Jose NASL team.    Secondly, why "FC?"  What exactly does that stand for?  "Football" club?  I've got news for Dallas's ownership, but "Football" in this country is not soccer.  Football is played with an oval ball and lasts up to three-and-a-half to four hours.  It's a much more established sport in this country.  And to publicly call Soccer "Football" is just going to cause more derision from the U.S. sports media.    I will never understand the need of U.S. Soccer fans to be more European, or more specifically, more English.  U.S. Soccer is an American version of the world's game.  Do they call it "Piede Sferra" in Italian?  No, they call it Calcio.  America has a strong sports tradition already, there's no need to supplant it with any foreign stuff.  Be proud of being American!

      When I was in college, my roommate Kevin was a big Michael Jordan fan.  This was back before the Bulls under Jordan won all their titles, and Jordan hadn't quite made the mega-stardom levels that he did in the mid-to-late nineties.  He was also a fan of Dominique Wilkins, and all the big "dunking" stars.    I, myself, was never a fan of flashy players.  I always liked the Grabowskis - the players who got down in the dirt and ground out wins.  Hence, I liked the Detroit Pistons of the late 80s and early 90s.  The "Bad Boys" were what I wanted to see - a tough, defensive minded team that took no prisoners and shut down the flash in favor of working for a win.  So, to combat Kevin's Jordan and Wilkins posters, I threw up my own poster of Bill Laimbeer and Rick Mahorn wearing black and silver Pistons jersies and crushing basketballs in their bare hands.    Kevin HATED it.  The Pistons style of play wasn't what basketball was supposed to be about, he'd say.  But he left me alone when they won two straight titles in 1989 and 1990.  And he'd especially leave me alone when I made the point that Jordan couldn't do anything against Pistons guard Joe Dumars.    Well, Dumars is back, as the director of basketball operations for the Pistons, and he's still finding ways to win.  The Pistons throttled the L.A. Lakers for the NBA Championship last night, and I stayed up to watch a pro basketball game for the first time since... possibly 1990.  :)    This team was, in many ways, just as exciting as the old Bad Boys were.  But in a way, I like them more.  They're even less flashy and more hard-nosed than the Bad Boys, but without the propensity for violence.  They just get in there and get the job done.    The player who impressed me the most was Ben Wallace.  Wallace pulled a horrific duty in having to cover the big man, Shaquille O'Neal, and he did it so well that Shaq was held to ten points less than his career playoff average.  And the guy just saw the court and moved to rebound the ball better than just about anyone I've seen in a long time.   I'm never going to be a huge basketball fan, as soccer is my first love sports-wise.  I'm not a fan of a sport where you pretty much have to be some sort of genetic freak to play - and basketball players are simply too damn tall.  I like sports that anyone can play.    But this team certainly did grind out the win by taking the league's most storied franchise to the hoop and showing them how it's done.  My hat is off to the 2003-4 Pistons - NBA Champs.

      It's very disappointing to look at the history of Crew Stadium and think about all the great events that have taken place there, and then look at what it's become today.  I remember the first season of MLS in Crew Stadium very well - May 15, 1999 was the beginning of what I had hoped would be the rennaissance of soccer in the city I'd adopted as my own.    That night, the Crew played host to the New England Revolution in the first game to be held in the first soccer-specific stadium in the country (I don't include Fort Lauderdale's Lockhart Stadium because it's a high school football stadium).  They won, 2-0, in front of a standing-room-only crowd of great soccer fans.    Fast forward to February 28, 2001.  Columbus played host to the top-draw game of the World Cup qualifying season when Mexico and the U.S. came to our fair stadium to battle it out.  The U.S. won, 2-0, and no fan dared leave early.    Fast forward to later that same year:  MLS Cup at Crew Stadium:  Los Angeles versus San Jose.  A pathetic crowd didn't even come close to filling the stadium that day, but it was argued at the time that because Columbus wasn't in the game, no one in Columbus cared all that much.  To that, I say "Feh."  A true soccer fan would go just to see the best two teams in the country duke it out for the championship.  And it was a very exciting game - went into extra time and won by the 'Quakes on a great Dwayne DeRosario goal.    Now, let's look at the Crew's first championship match in Crew Stadium.  Perhaps as a nod to the Crew after screwing them in their FIRST championship match, against the Chicago Fire at Soldier Field.  The game was originally to be held in Virginia Beach, but a hurricane caused the game to be moved.  U.S. Soccer, in its infinite lack of wisdom, sent the game to Soldier.  Not exactly fair, especially since the game was to be at a neutral site.  Anyway, apparently that rule went out the window after that because Columbus held the 2002 U.S. Open Cup final game at Crew Stadium on Oct. 24, 2002.  The crowd was pathetic.  I had invited my brother, sister, and cousin to the game and despite it being a well-fought match, the crowd was tiny and missed seeing the Crew win its first title ever.    Finally, let's look at last Sunday's World Cup Qualifying match.  Less than 10,000 people, a good percentage of them Grenadians, took to the seats of Hunt Park to watch the U.S. open its Germany 2006 against the island that Ronnie Reagan made free.  That's less than 50% of capacity, folks.  And the U.S. looked good - it's not like this was the 2003 Crew playing, it was the best that U.S. Soccer had to offer, in a game that was the beginning of the team trying to return to the World Cup.    But... should Columbus be ashamed of itself?  I say "yes" and "no."  Part of the blame has to lie with the Crew Stadium staff, and beyond that, Hunt Sports Group.  I've seen ticket agents for the Crew come and go with more frequency than some migrant workers.  HSG needs to learn that if you want a good, experienced, and loyal staff, you have to pay for it.  The Crew pays their employees very poorly, to the point where the talented people leave.    But Columbus, for all its posturing about being a "soccer town," has proven itself to be nothing more than an event-driven town.  If a big thing comes to town, then it's certainly worth going to, at least a couple of times.  That was proven by the good crowds in MLS Year One and in 1999 for the opening of Crew Stadium.  But now, the soccer fan in Columbus doesn't feel the need to go any more.  I call those people fake.  If you are a soccer fan, you go watch pro soccer in Crew Stadium.  I won't lie, I can totally understand skipping college soccer events - that's some pretty poor soccer and it frustrates me to watch it.  But when the U.S. team can't draw 20,000 people from a city of over a million... then that town no longer deserves to call itself a soccer city.

      I watched an excerpt of a Howard Dean interview with Fox News's Sean Hannity today (Hannity was actually on the floor of the Democratic Convention, I couldn't believe it) where Hannity was asking Dean about the "left's" (Hannity's word,  not mine) forgiveness of John Kerry and John Edwards for their laying out the belief that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, while they refuse to leave President Bush alone with that.  Dean obviously mentioned that there were plenty of other lies that the president told us, but I think that Dean missed out on one simple fact.      Where exactly did Kerry and Edwards get their information on the WMDs in Iraq?  Well, most likely they came from the president and his administration.  At the time, there was no reason to believe that Bush was lying through his teeth about the presence of WMDs there.  Now, I disagree that we should have ever gone to Iraq, but the fact remains that Congress needs to be able to trust the president with intelligence, as intelligence agencies like the CIA, NSC, and FBI are under his jurisdiction as the leader of the executive branch of our government.      So, if Congress can't trust our nation's leader to get them good information, that leader needs to be at least voted out of office.  He SHOULD be impeached.  He's certainly done a lot more harm than President Clinton ever did with Monica Lewinsky.

      For a long time, I ignored fan films - most of the ones I saw were for Star Wars and such and I honestly don't have much interest in those. And for the most part, the quality is too poor to even warrant looking at them.     But just recently I came across a new website with fan films -  urlLink Batman Fan Films . This site has top notch movies connected to it - some of which are darned close to being studio quality. I think it's worth checking out.     Especially good are the latest two entries:   Grayson  and  World's Finest .  GREAT stuff.

      Okay, last night my wife told me to do something that I almost had to post right away - but she told me to turn off the computer and go to bed.&nbsp;   I've been trying to be a good husband and put down the toilet seat after doing you-know-what.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well...  last night she asked me to leave it up. &nbsp; She MEANT to say to leave the seat down and the lid up (it's hard for her to bend over to lift it, I guess).&nbsp; But you have to admit that's pretty funny.&nbsp;

      I absolutely LOVE how the Bush Administration is suddenly hinting at the possibility of an Iran (not Iraq, notice) connection to the 9/11 attacks, and just before the Democratic Convention is about to start up.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Could it be that our dear president is worried about the Democrats bringing out how much his administration has screwed things up both domestically and overseas, and he wants to distract attention from that by creating a new enemy for us all to fear?&nbsp;  &nbsp;  This is like the  urlLink October Surprise , only earlier.&nbsp; I'm predicting now that the Shrub and company will be coming out with some big announcement about Iran's involvement in 9/11 this weekend or next week, during the Democratic Convention.&nbsp; Keep in mind that the CIA has already said that it has no evidence of Iranian involvement...  &nbsp;  As far as the actual October Surprise goes, btw, I think we're going to see a certain Al Qaeda leader suddenly show up just before the election.&nbsp;

      And it's about time, too.  Major kudos to the Columbus City Council for enacting a ban on cigarette smoking in public places.    I like a good bar - but the number one thing I hate about them is coming out smelling like an ashtray.  You just KNOW the damage that's being done to your health in such places, yet smokers just puff away like they own the place.    Now, I'm not going to tell anyone that they can't smoke.  In fact, if you're a smoker, then I congratulate you on being brave enough to withstand the hordes of evidence that you're harming yourself by taking on such a nasty habit.  But that does not give you ANY right to harm me just because you want to light up.  If you want to light up, then go somewhere that your habit is not harming my health.  I have the right to go into a public place and not expect to be made sick.    Major kudos to the cities around Columbus, as well - the suburbs.  From all reports I'm hearing, most of them are looking to enact similar bans.  This is going to make it easier for Columbus businesses to weather the storm of people stomping out because they can't smoke, and looking for other places to do it.    Now, if there's only a way to get smokers to stop littering by throwing their butts out the window at every traffic stop...

      Had to pay my SBC bill today, which I receive and pay online.  As I was paying it, I noticed that my old residential address was still on the bill.  Well, that ain't right, so  I looked around on the website for a place to change that.  Didn't find anything, all I found was a spot to change my password, nickname for my account, or username.    So, being the sort of person who likes to have his ducks in a row, more or less, I emailed their customer service desk.  Here's my message:     When I view my eBill, I see that it has my old residential address on it.  How do I change this?    And here's the response I got.     Dear Mr. Fellrath,  Thank you for your recent email. To change your account information please follow these instructions:   1. Log in to MySBC(SM) account at https://www.sbc.com/mysbc with your User ID and Password.  2. At the MySBC service Overview page, click on  the Edit Profile link located  on the upper right portion of the page. 3. At the MySBC account Profile page, click on the Edit button beside the information you would like to update and follow the instructions.   You may also update this information by selecting the SBC eBill Profile tab from your online bill and then clicking on  Edit MySBC(SM) Profile.   Now... this was what I already did.  This was where there were no options for the address.  So I responded one more time...    None of the options on that page give me access to changing my address, as it appears on my eBill.  Is there another place I must go to change that?   And... here's their exact response.  Pay CLOSE attention to their word usage.   Dear Mr. Fellrath,  Thank you for your recent email.  Please contact an  Ebill representative, at 1-8XX-XXX-XXXX for  futile  assistance.  Thank yoy for choosing SBC products and services.    It's all I can do not to make my next message say:     I already got your  futile  assistance.  Now I'd like some that's actually HELPFUL.   I do think that pretty much says it all, don't you?

      Okay, as my wife just pointed out to me, I have failed to note that I had a very significant event in my life take place just a couple nights ago...   I actually felt my child KICK for the first time.    Jennifer has actually been feeling this for some time, now, but this was a first for me.  According to her, the kid is ready to start youth soccer now.  And I'd been trying to feel it myself for a while... including telling Jenn to wake me up if it got to be strong enough that I could feel it during the night.  This is apparently akin to trying to make a Greek hero after a long lingering gaze at Medusa.  It ain't gonna happen.    So for me to finally feel it was pretty special.  I feel sort of detached from the whole process, being the man and not having anything inside me other than the carrots and celery I'm currently munching on.  But such is the role of the expectant father, so I'll continue to watch and wait, and naturally help as much as I can, until the day that I can hold the kid in my arms, watch it spit on my shirt, and then hand the tyke back to Jenn while I run out to the kitchen to clean myself up.  :)

      From the website:   urlLink http://www.thequarter.org/Media/VikingName.php   My Viking Name is:     Jn Oakenhorse   Your Viking Personality: You're a fearsome Viking, but you aren't completely uncivilized. The other Vikings make fun of you for that. You have a thirst for battle, and tend to strike first and think later. You might be able to hold your own on the battlefield, but you're no "berserker".   You might grumble a bit at the lack of amenities on board a Viking longboat, but you can handle it. Other Vikings consider you "one of the guys".   You have a fairly pragmatic attitude towards life, and tend not to expend effort in areas where it would be wasted. You sometimes come off as a bit of a snob. Vikings are not snobbish people -- they either like you, or they kill you. Try to be more like a Viking.

      My wife has asked me to expand on  urlLink my post about her asking me to leave the toilet seat up .  Specifically, she'd like me to point out that I still left it down.  See, that's what too many  years of poor patterning by society has done for me.

      Check this out... I'm not a  Stargate  fan (though I might have been if I'd started watching the show at the beginning), but this was brought to my attention via one of my favorite blogs,  urlLink Idleworm .   Apparently the owner of the "SG-1 Archive," a fan site for the show  Stargate SG-1 , was raided by the FBI based on a never-served cease-and-desist order from MGM and the MPAA.   urlLink Read the article for more .   This is just another example of how archaic copyright law is.  Here's a guy who has not only helped to support a fan base for MGM's product, but actually helped to SELL MERCHANDISE for their product.  And they repay him by telling him to stop and sending the FBI to raid his home and steal his equipment.  If I were him, I'd drop the site altogether and stop watching the show, at the very least.   Another thing:  why is the FBI bothering with a sci-fi fan website in the first place?  If we have all these problems with terrorism scares and such in this country, don't they have more important things to do?

      Sports Illustrated sent me a SPECIAL IMPORTANT email today... apparently some other woman has accused Los Angeles Lakers start Kobe Bryant of groping her or something at Shaquille O'Neal's home in Orlando, so the Shaq may have to take the stand.   When, exactly, did sports news start to revolve around the extracurricular activities of these folks?  Sports news, to me, relates to on-the-field events and player movements.  Now, I can see doing simple reporting on this topic, as it could have repercussions for the Lakers if Kobe goes to jail or something... but sending out a SPECIAL email for that?   Not necessary.  Sports Illustrated needs to remember what's important in sports - and it's not the money the players and owners make.  It's how the fans are affected.  Pro sports is entertainment, pure and simple.  And the entertainment is an on-the-field thing.  It shouldn't revolve around the personal lives of these folks.  The more we treat these folks as larger than life, the more we're going to see stupid stories like this.   I would ask Sports Illustrated and all its ilk to cut down on the gossipy crap and simply cover the sports.

      I  highly suggest reading this article from the Blog for America website about the underhanded tactics of  House of Reprsentatives Majority Leader Tom DeLay, as accounted for by Representative Jerry Nadler (D-NY).   Nadler and others were attempting to pass an amendment to a bill that would have killed part of the Orwellian "Patriot" Act, when DeLay took over.   urlLink Just read it and become outraged .

      My wife and our friend Carole and I went to see M. Night Shyamalan's  The Village  yesterday. Great movie...I highly recommend it. But as good as the movie was, the number one thing I took away from my afternoon at the AMC Lennox was the  urlLink  Batman Begins   teaser trailer!  I'm a Batman fan, just so you know. Actually, I'm a comic book movie fan in general, but Bats is one of my favorite comics as well as comic book movie. And I was (along with many others) extraordinarily disturbed to see the goofy quagmire that the Batman movies deteriorated into after the first one came out. The original  Batman  was a classic, IMHO. Tim Burton did everything right with that movie. Not too over the top, not too forced, just right. Michael Keaton was a surprisingly good Batman/Bruce Wayne, and Jack Nicholson was a great Joker.  After the first movie, though, it went downhill.   Batman Returns  was just a bit too... odd. Danny Devito was a great choice for the Penguin, but Burton's direction and character design with him was just over the top. And Michelle Pfeiffer was a great Catwoman, but she played it TOO campy. Again, I blame Burton for that one - he's the director. Plus the scene with the thousands of remote control penguins? No thanks.   Batman Forever  had the makings of a good flick. Val Kilmer was good as Batman and Bruce Wayne, different than Keaton but still effective. The story was a little more back to Batman's roots. But Tommy Lee Jones was a waste as Two-Face - he could have been absolutely great if they'd given the character the consideration he deserves, but he was basically just a colorful face in the movie. The real star of the movie was Jim Carrey - and though he was good as the Riddler, the movie isn't supposed to be about just the villain.  Plus, it had some REALLY bad editing in it. You could sort of see that Bruce was fighting with some guilt over his parents' deaths, but they edited all that out for some reason. It got a bit confusing.  Add to that the neon/fluorescent scenery and it wasn't the best of Batman movies. Joel Schumacher apparently said he was using the comic books as the basis for his movie, but it sure didn't feel like it.   Batman and Robin  isn't even worth mentioning, except to say that it was all Joel Schumacher's fault.  Anyway, the trailer for  Batman Begins  seems like they're on the right foot again. We hopefully have a much darker superhero once again, and it'll be interesting to see them put together the creation of Batman as a hero (which is what I believe the theme of this movie is). Christian Bale is very promising as the Dark Knight, and I eagerly await more.

      No air conditioning in the office today... things are a little bit warm, so to anyone who comes across me today, I apologize for being testy.   I did buy a fan, though.  Thank you CVS and Duracraft!  :)
