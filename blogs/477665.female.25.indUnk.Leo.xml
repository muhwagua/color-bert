       salsa dancing....  cafe se villa is the place to be on a thursday night if you wanna learn salsa. it never really interest me but i'm open to new things. so when my girlfriends suggested we go, i was in. it was pretty cool because they give you lessons before the dancing really begins. you know me...i'm a little shy but the atmosphere was so welcoming and friendly that dancing with strangers was natural.   here's the difference between a salsa dancer and a clubbin' guy: the salsa dancer is a lot more respecting...not trying to hit up on you, just wanting to salsa and teach you how. a clubbin' guy (not all)...will try to hit on you, grab your ass, caress your back, kiss your hand, pretend to trip onto you, eye you up and down in the most perverted way and if you turn him down, he moves right along to the next girl and does his routine all over again. that's just my personal observation and i'm sure many of you would agree.     anyway back to my story...salsa dancing is a lot of fun especially if you have a good partner. i was spinning, turning, twisting, dipping, smiling, and laughing...just having a great time. oh yeah and a lot of hip action is involved too. it was cool because you'd switch partners all night long. all the guys i danced with were hella good at salsa...they made me look good..haha me and my two left feet.   anyways, i think my clubbin' days are catching up to me. i have a bit of cold right now...sucks since i haven't been sick in almost 2 years. i must have jinxed myself some time ago. i'm sorry kim, i promise not to make fun of your everlasting cough ever again...please take it back...i don't want it!    it's friday again and i should be going to LA for antionette's birthday, the big two-three,  but i feel like shit and i have to move this weekend...i'll be homeless for a few days...anyone wanna take in a poor girl??? i'm a good roomie,really!!  well, i've been waiting all week to party in hollywood...damn, planning never works for me. i've been lucky so far but recently nothing seems to be going my way. oh well "whatever happens, happens for a reason"...ummmm...don't know what the reason is but hopefully i'll find out soon.

       actions vs. words...  i'm a very strong believer that actions speak louder than words. but at one time in my life, i remember thinking why couldn't he express how he felt, why didn't he write me poetry or even letters, why was it so hard for him to tell me sweet nothings. in a way, i think i felt i was missing something because he didn't do any of  those things and with this mentality, our relationship went a rye.  and that was the beginning of the end.  it's been 9 1/2 months since we broke up. i know he was hurting alot and to this day, i still feel that he's bitter...not sure if that's a good word choice, but i still feel the anger and resentment that he still has for me everytime i see him.  when we broke up, i really felt that we could be great friends, that things wouldn't change because i considered him my best friend for so long but that didn't happen. when we broke up, i lost him, i lost my best friend...the one person who knew my in's and out's and at times believed knew me better than my own family. even though he had a hard time expressing himself, i knew he loved me with every cell in his body. i knew he would do anything for me,  i knew he would never break my heart. he's one of those rare guys out there that is actually good and what i mean by good is that he truly has a loving and trusting heart. not many out there. let's just say, whoever he may end up with is one lucky girl.   this whole experience has been a very painful one. i've learned a lot about people and have come to realize what i should have known 9 1/2 months ago. i've reached a point in my life where words mean absolutely nothing until they prove that they can deliver. people can tell you one thing and really mean something else, people can lie to your face, people can twist your words, people can just be simply heartless when they want something so bad that they would say anything to get it. shut up already...heard it before, don't need to hear it again. i use to want someone who could talk and express words easily but after knowing what i know, i rather have a mute then a broken record. my only conclusion to this is...stay away from chatter boxes..you know the ones that tell you  everything  you want to hear.

       hmm....another way to look at it  "Simple Truths" by Kent Nerburn "It is a mystery why we fall in love. It is a mystery how it happens. It is a mystery when it comes. It is a mystery why some loves fail. You can analyze this mystery and look for reasons and causes, but you will never do any more than take the life out of the experience.   Love is more than the sum of the interests and attractions and commonalities that two people share. And just as life itself is a gift that comes and goes in its time, the coming of love must be taken as an unfathomable gift that cannot be questioned in its ways.  Too often, when love comes to people, they try to grasp the love and hold it to them, refusing to see that it is a gift freely given and a gift that just as freely moves away. When they fall out of love, or the person they love feels the spirit of love leaving, they try desperately to reclaim the love that is lost rather than accepting the gift for what it was.  They want answers where there are no answers. They want to know what is wrong with them, or they try to get their lover to change, thinking that if some small thing were different love would bloom again. They blame their circumstances. They blame each other. They try anything to give meaning to what has happened. But there is no meaning beyond the love itself, and until they accept its own mysterious ways they live in a sea of misery.  You need to treat what love brings you with kindness. If you find yourself in love with someone who does not love you, be gentle with yourself. There is nothing wrong with you. Love just didn't choose to rest in the other person's heart.  If you find someone else in love with you toward whom you feel no love, feel honored that love came and called at your door, but gently refuse the gift you cannot return. Do not take advantage, do not cause pain. How you deal with love is how love will deal with you, and all our hearts feel the same pains and joys, even if our lives and ways are very different.  If you fall in love with another who falls in love with you, and then love chooses to leave, do not try to reclaim it or to assess blame. Let it go. There is a reason and there is a meaning. You will know it in time, but time itself will choose the moment.  Remember this and keep it in your heart. You don't choose love. Love chooses you. All you can really do is accept it for all its mystery when it comes into your life. Feel the way it fills you to overflowing, then reach out and give it away. Give it back to the person who brought it to you. Give it to others who seem poor in spirit. Give it to the world around you in any way you can.  Love has its own time, its own season, and its own reasons for coming and going. You cannot bribe it or coerce it or reason it into staying. If it chooses to leave, from your heart or from the heart of your lover, there is nothing you can do and nothing you should do. Be glad that it came to live for a moment in your life. If you keep your heart open, it will surely come again. "

       just one of those days...  today sucked, let me tell you what a crappy day i had today first of all my business trip to vegas in october didn't get approved...my boss said i could go yesterday and then called me today while he was at a seminar to tell that my trip got denied by the ceo for some lame excuse like they needed me here during that time...b.s. he didn't even have the balls to tell me face to face...when i  found out i was gonna go to vegas, anxious tiff booked her flight on southwest.   secondly, i scheduled a virtual seminar this morning to demo one of the products that we'll be implementing for hr/payroll. i failed to read the email that the seminar would start at 10:30 eastern time....EASTERN time!!! they should have bolded it or something.  i brought my laptop and projector down into our conference room and got set up for our clients. logged on at 10:30 OUR time and got an error message saying "the meeting is over".  it actually started at 7:30 am. damn i felt stupid. so with my head down i packed everything up and brought it back to my cubicle...all of the sudden it hit me that i needed the laptop and projector in that same room for a training session that afternoon...haha.   oh and then my car starts making weird rattling sounds...i found out it's the brakes...hasn't been changed since 1998. called my hero, my dad and he came to the rescue on that one. i guess shit happens. well all i know is that tomorrow is definitely going to be off the wall...it's friday...you all know what that means...shake that bootie!!!

       identity theft….  have you ever had a gut wrenching, heart pounding, head rushing and hands shaking experience all at the same time? well yesterday i felt all this and more.  i felt so sick to my stomach that my entire afternoon, i felt like vomiting.  here’s the story….  on october 15, 2002 i received a phone call from a man name nick perkins, a bank manager at the washington mutual branch in houston, texas.  he tells me that they have a lady there who claims that i wrote her a check for $2500.00 and ask if i did in fact do this.  my heart stopped for a split second as i tried to grasp at what he was saying. i couldn’t believe this was happening to me. with a shaky tone, i tell him “NO.”  all of the sudden, i felt my mouth rambling on and on with endless questions of who, how, when, what, and why.  the answers I received became more of a nightmare and more dissatisfying then expected.  here’s the information i received on this lady:  name:  Jamie Clay  gender:  Female  ethnicity:  African American  age:  Mid twenties  drivers license:  Arizona  apparently, jamie clay tried to cash a fake check at this washington mutual bank in texas. she knew my social security number, my mother’s maiden name, my driver’s license number, and my date of birth. god knows what other information she knew. when the bank teller questioned her about the check, she claimed that we had a fender bender one night at a club and I paid her off.  luckily the bank teller was suspicious of her and notified me before cashing the check.  he asked if I wanted to press criminal charges and of course i answered, “YES!”  they called the police and once the police arrived at the texas bank, he gave me a call.  here’s the officers’ information:  name:  Deputy Schields  gender:  Male  department:  Harris County Sheriffs Department  phone #:   deputy schields asked me a series of questions and after I confirmed everything, he said he had the lady under arrest and that he was going to take her to jail. damn hooker, she deserves everything she’s getting. anyway, he gave me the case # and said he would be in touch.  down at the rancho san diego washington mutual bank, i spoke to naomi who was in charge of fraudulent activity division. she closed my accounts and gave me instructions on how to proceed with getting outstanding checks paid so they would not bounce.  now i have to go through the hassle of canceling all my outstanding checks and everyone knows how horrible i am at balancing my checkbook so this will definitely be a pain in the ass. i’m seriously thinking about switching banks; i have nothing against WAMU but better safe then sorry.  i also had to cancel my credit cards just in case that information was also stolen. i’ve called all 3 of the major credit bureaus- equifax, experian and transunion so they could put an alert on my accounts.    i’m so sick of this bullshit….why can’t people just work hard for their money like the rest of us???? i still have a lot of phone calls to make but hopefully it will be all over soon. i have mixed emotions right now…i’m pissed that my identity has been stolen, my private information compromised, i feel so violated, i feel sad that there are evil people in this world that would go against what’s right to make money, i’m puzzled to how and who else has my pertinent information, i'm overwhelmed with stress, and now more then over i’m suspicious of people. i hate feeling like this. i know I trust a little to easily, which is one fault of mine.  i’ve been told many times that i’m too soft hearted. well no more! i’m fed up with being taken advantage of.  so don’t mess with me or you’ll end up like Jamie…in jail. that bitch definitely messed with the wrong tran!

       to the skies....  you know sometimes i really amaze myself. i never thought i would actually carry out a new year's resolution and for the first time in 23 years, i did it...yes ME!!  in 2002, i decided that i would exercise a lot and also do something i've never done as a child...travel by plane.  i swear it was only 2 years ago that i actually flew on a plane...i guess you could say i was an airplane virgin.  but this year changed dramatically. i've been on more airplane rides then i count on all fours. everytime i've gone, i would meet the most random people. twice i ran into Noel, this guy i use to live with in the dorms and we even flew to the same destination...twice!  i also remember this one time (and no not at band camp) i sat by this women in her 40s, never married who tried to give me advice on men. she said "they'll no good and if you wanna be happy, never rely on a man". the duration of the trip consisted of male bashing. she's definitely been burned way to many times in her life. and then i met this other guy and a bunch of his friends on the plane. they were all from san diego. we exchanged numbers and have been friends ever since. i still remember the night at bar dynamite...giggles galore! but now my southwest buddy has moved to the city (sf) which i guess is cool since you all know how much i love to visit san francisco.   i've never had a dull adventure at the airport, on the plane or at my desired destination. it's a memory i will soon not forget. i love flying, i love traveling, i love meeting new people. just being in a different environment, surrounded by unfamiliar faces, and a little power blaster...i lose all inhibitions, which isn't bad..not bad at all. i guess in a way, i could compare running to traveling. those who know me, know i love running outdoors. there's something serene about running in the open. all is see is beauty, a beauty so pure that i don't want to stop. as the wind blows gently across my face and as i start spacing out into the world before me, i feel free. no worries, just free. and so i guess running and  traveling gives me the same high. it's nice to get away...away from the real world.   so my next destination, vegas baby, cha-ching!

       rub-a-dub-dub...  i've been told by a certain individual (i won't mention any names but u know who you are!) that i suck at giving massages. dude, how hard could it be? i mean, i'm taking time out...time where i could be sleeping or eating...to what?!?..give you a back rub and you complain?? once, i was told on how to give one..."you shouldn't press on the spine..that doesn't feel good"...what the heck do i look like...a professional masseuse..if you want a professional massage, this isn't the place to get one!! anyways, i'm not sure why i'm blogging about this because it'll probably come back and bite me in the ass. oh wells..so continuing with my story..this person had the nerve to tell me that and ever since then...i stopped giving massages. my excuse: "well someone said i suck so i don't give 'em anymore".  well it didn't work...my excuse.  the response i would get back would be "i don't believe you, here, give me one and i'll tell you the truth, i'm sure you're really good." damn..i thought i got away with that one.    it's weird...for the longest time, i wouldn't want to give anyone a back rub. they would ask and i would say me first and fall asleep or when my turn was up, i'd say "i'm hungry...let's go eat" and then the person would forget all about the massage. ok..i know that's awful but i'm lazy...hey at least i'm honest.  anywhooo, something has come over me...something strange. i find myself doing things i said i would never do. here's a classic example...those who know me, know i don't watch movies in theaters especially if the guy thinks it's a date. i haven't seen one since july but about two months ago i did. here's another example...i said i would never take anyone to my solo spot..yet i've been contemplating about making it into a hang out spot. and now this...here it goes...(*takes a deep breath*) i volunteered to give a massage!! it's shockin' i tell you. but here's the twist, i still didn't give one yet i received one. awww...ur just simply amazing.  well i guess i'm just not meant to give massages but you know what..i'm a sport at receiving them...haha!!!  have a great day everyone!!

       a prayer...  days would past by, where u didn't hear from me...weeks gone by, and you still havent' seen me.  a quick phone call here and there to let you know i wouldn't be coming home was all that was given to you.  when i finished my last course, i know you thought i'd be home more cuz i didn't have school as an excuse to not come home. but the complete opposite took place and the visits and phone calls became less. it had been awhile since i've been home, i've was too wrapped up in all the fun..never wanting to plant my foot on the floor..always on the go.   last week my older sister came home from stockton to visit. i finally had a reason to go home not that i never wanted to, i just figured everyone was busy but doing fine and that i wouldn't be too missed if i skipped a few weekends.  what i went home to was a complete shock..a shock i could have lived without. instead of coming home to a house filled with love, laugher, smiles, and food...i came home to a house that was empty, no laughter, no smiles, and no mom's cooking. i decided to call my sister..thinkin' they were all actually at my grandma's house.  i stepped in my parents room to use the phone and to my surprise, my mom was plopped on the bed all wrapped in her blanket. it was only 3:30 in the afternoon. as she lifted her head to see who was there, i jumped on the bed, hugged her tight and said "mommy i'm home!!" but the response i got back was a weak sigh. i took another look at my mom and realized she wasn't feeling well. if you all have seen my mom..you know she's a heathly women..a very strong women. but today was not the case..actually it's been a few days that she's been like this. she looked drained, she looked weak, she looked sad, she didn't look like mom. i asked her what happened, i asked why, i asked her when but she was too tired to talk. i laid in bed with her as i held her in my arms. we feel asleep together and was awoken 2 hours later by my sisters.  they said they got the prescription for vicodin in order for her pain to subside.. the pain..wait...what pain? what was she feelin? what happened? why was no one was talkin? everyone kept quiet when i spoke, endless questions flew from my mouth..yet no response.   i still didn't know what was wrong with her. i don't like being in the dark. i pulled my sister aside and asked her again to tell me what happened to mom. she said "while you were in vegas, mom went to the emergency room." i closed my eyes as she began to tell me the story. everything and nothing started running through my head. as i opened my eyes again, all i could say was "why didn't you call me..i don't care if i was out of town..i need to know these things. i want to know if anything happens to anybody in this family. i have the right to know."   my mom is a fighter..it was only 6 years ago that the doctor told us that we might lose her but we didn't. she fought that battle and won. this is just another battle that lays on her shoulders now and the outcome of this one will be the same.   it sucks that something bad has to happen in order for you to see what really matters in life. all the mini drama episodes..not so important anymore. i'm gonna go home a lot more now, i'm gonna be there for my family, i'm gonna do whatever i can to help my mom get better and when she does, i'll still be going home.  i just hope this is enough. Not a day goes by that i don't think about her or pray for her. mom,  i'll always be here for you..u can count on that. i luv you.

       a days dream...  daydreaming is what i do best. if i had to pick a talent (besides eating), i would have to say that i'm the best daydreamer alive. from the moment i click snooze, and i'm half awake, i'm daydreamin'..i don't really care to share these dreams but i find myself having the same dreams all day long...like right now.  daydreaming is purely heaven to me. i can't snap out of it...my mind wonders off and i don't care to come back. many times i find myself daydreaming at my solo spot. i found it one day as i was daydreaming in my car...something led me to this place and ever since then, i've been going back just to daydream. ahh..i think it's time for my nap :-)

       peas n' carrots  it was a year or so ago when we decided this was it. little did we know that fate had something else in-store for us.  i can still remember the long talks of dreams that we held on to for the life of us.  always thinkin' things would change..it would get better, that it had to. time after time..we were proven wrong. our circumstances were different but our problems the same. the tears rollin' down our cheeks as we drove to work, the gut-wrenching pain we shared when the hurt was unbearable, the sadness in our eyes as we tried to escape the world...but you were there to share this with me and i with you...a burst of emotions, a few long-lasting silence, a shoulder to lean on, an ear to listen, and comforting hugs, but ultimately what did it was a kick in the ass back to reality.   our story doesn't just end there, our paths became one in the same. a life changing experience effected both our lives. there was no more of "them" as we both closed our eyes and buried our heads in our lap and cried like the rain that falls upon us on a winter's day. we were now alone. our hearts crushed, our dreams shattered and our hopes dead.  little did we know that this was the best thing to happen to us...  it was just the beginning..a new beginning for the both of us. we became eachother's side kicks..inseparable at the hip. cruised up and down southern california...san diego, irvine, santa ana, la, and hollywood. we eventually made our way further north...destination...well vegas, san francisco and tahoe baby.  i'm telling you..if our parents knew of what we did..they'd shoot us. 2 girls driving all the way to la just to club..and then drive back the same night...i swear there were so many times that i would pinch myself just to stay awake at the wheel. the clubs were fun, we met a lot of strangers and we'd like to keep em' that way...who cares if they thought we were stuck up or bitches...as long as they didn't touch..we were cool with em'. *news flash* *news flash**..we go to dance not to get picked up on!!!  i swear i think we heard every line out there...you boys must all read from the same book. but besides that..we always had a good time..if we weren't eating, we'd be clubbin', if we weren't shoppin', we'd be clubbin', and if we were drinkin', we'd be clubbin'!! we became clubrats.. i can't believe i just called us that but you know what..we were. the music, the vibe...it made us happy and that's exactly what we needed.    it's crazy the way things work out. we've learned alot and i think this whole experience has only made us stronger. if we were to ever fall again, it won't ever hurt like it did before. we've already reached the lowest and we both know that once you're down..the only way to go is up. and that's what we've done..picked ourselves up and looked at the world right in it's face. so now that we've overcome our fears and opened our hearts again, we're lettin' in a whole new level of uncertainty and vulnerability. but you know what?!?  i don't care cuz i know myself now. i know who i am. and i know what i'm worth but i will tell you this, i'm glad we're going through this together! i wouldn't have it any other way!!   "A true friend is someone who reaches for your hand and touches your heart."  --you are the very meaning of this quote.

        A poem for us girls....   (i never really read forwards but i thought this was hillarious so i decided to post it...haha! enjoy! )    "I shave my legs, I sit down to pee.  And I can justify any shopping spree.    Don't go to a barber, but a beauty salon.  I can get a massage without a hard-on.    I can balance the checkbook, I can pump my own gas.  Can talk to my friends, about the size of my ass.   My beauty's a masterpiece, and yes, it takes long.  At least I can admit, to others when I'm wrong.    I don't drive in circles, at any cost.  And I don't have a problem, admitting I'm lost.    I never forget, an important date.  You just gotta deal with it, I'm usually late.   I don't watch movies, with lots of gore.  Don't need instant replay, to remember the score.   I won't lose my hair, I don't get jock itch.  And just cause I'm assertive, Don't call me a bitch.   Don't say to your friends, Oh yeah, I can get her.  In your dreams, my dear, I can do better!   Flowers are okay, But jewelry's best.  Look at me you idiot... Not at my chest??  I don't have a problem, With Expressing my feelings.  I know when you're lying, You look at the ceiling.   DON'T call me a GIRL , a BABE or a CHICK .  I am a WOMAN. Get it?, you DICK!?!

       lucky charms....  if i had to sum up in 1 word to describe my very eventful weekend, i would have to say "lucky". those who know me, know that i've always considered myself a jinx but i guess that only applies in san diego.  but that's not the case when i go to vegas... i'm a lucky girl!!! there we were, my turn to shoot, all eyes on the dice...i take a deep breath and before i know it, the dice flies from my hand and fate lands it on table. the crowd smiles and cheers as i just made them a little richer. and so the minutes go by and i'm still shooting, the crowd cheering and everyone winning. at one point, i crapped out but that didn't stop me from shooting...the table requested that i take another turn and shoot once again. wow..i became everyone's bestfriend.  i think we played craps twice, once at MGM and another time at Luxor..both times we came out as winners. and of course i couldn't leave vegas without playing the wheel of fortune slot machine. i love seeing the wheel spin as i scream "wheel of fortuneeee!" and so i won a little money there too.   i had a great time everyone. you guys made this trip very memorable. the rio buffet was awesome as usual. pebs..i think we might have scared some of our newly found friends with our talent..haha. hard rock hotel--babies...definitely chill..and it did rock. a lot of dancing, a lot of chillin', a lot of long beaches, and group jager blasters definitely made the night. can some one please say "strong".  i still can't believe the bouncers led us to the VIP room...ahhh.. fresh air..exactly what we needed!  hahaha. and so the night ends with us dragging ourselves back to the hotel room to only wake up with a headache.   sat afternoon, we went to eat at emeril's..you know  "bam!" and to tell you the truth, i don't see what all the hype is about but i really did enjoy the company of all of you...and that's all that matters! sat night, we went to the palms..club rain.  the line was ridiculously long..luckily a.j. and his girlie got their at 9 pm for us to cut..so it was all good. club rain was off the wall. the lights, the stage, the atmosphere, the patio, the music, the vibe, the club itself..dope!  but the drinks...EXPENSIVE. oh well.. so i think this was a very unforgettable night but to some of us...*ahem* tazzy..i'm sure we would like it erased from our memory..hehe. but next weekend that's a different story and i know you'll make up for it.   anywhoo..it's monday morning..i'm still a little tired, a little groggy and my eyes sting a bit but i'm happy... i named the title of this blog "lucky charms" not because i won at gambling but because i definitely think i found myself one... you are my lucky charm... and this weekend it finally hit me how lucky i really am. i am very fortunate to have you in my life, to have been able to share this weekend with you..all of you. so...my lucky charm... if you don't mind, i would like to keep you..for it is you that has opened up my heart to believe again. 2003..the year of the goat..yep, it's definitely my year. :-) luv you guys!!!!

       and she's off...  what is it about vegas? i mean..really?  the food, the clubs, the hot guys, the hot girls, the lights, the slots, craps, blackjack, free drinks, strip bars, shows, shoppin'..i dunno..must be the whole sha-bang. i find myself there a few times a year.. and  guess what kids????..here we go again...vegas baby, vegas!!  i'm not into gamblining cuz i've realized after trial and error that i suck at it, but that's if i play with my own money... i think my friends/family felt sorry for me at times cuz i was such a fat loser and say.."here's $20..$40 bucks...try your luck again." low and behold, i'd win..double, triple, and even quadruple my money...no joke. i'd be on a winning streak..winning for myself and winning for the whole table.  i guess you could say i have a track record of winning with other people's money. so i've decided to put my own money where it belongs and that's buying food to feed my tummy...(mmm' rio seafood buffet) anywhoo, i decided to let the whole world know my secret on how to win at gambling and that's to let me play with your money..if you don't believe me..give me $20 or however much you want and i'll play but here's the deal..if i lose..opps..sorry...but if i win..i'll keep the winnings, give u a big hug and say thanks...hehe.  i'm so excited..i can't even sit still.  i love hangin' out with all of you..but once again we are missing one c-toon link. sux but trust me..we'll definitely be thinkin' about you sweetie.  ok..the count down is in..20 more hours to go and i'm outta here...byeeeeeeee!!!!!

       spring fever...  i think i'm gonna try to get back into this bloggin' trend. i started one about a year ago and never really kept up with it and then i started this one "if you only knew..." and i think i did pretty well but things got a little too busy...you know doing important stuff...hehe...well lets just say i was free minded and spirited like there was no tomorrow. it was all about having fun and doing what i've always wanted to do.  for the first time in my life, i can honestly say i finally know where i'm going. my head is on straight and my direction is clear. my goals and dreams can never be shattered..not now..not ever.   let's see..the last time i blogged was in october...it's been 5 months..damn i must have been livin' it up..haha.  so much has happened. it's weird to think that in a year's time frame, my thoughts have transformed like a catepillar in a cacoon to a free flying butterfly.  words don't phase me, what bothered me before, i could care less about now, the emotional roller coaster that once plagued my life has been lifted from the smiles and kind words of others. i dunno..i just think my life has taken the turn for the better.  c-toons...i wanna thank you for always being there for me..through thick and thin...good times and bad...tho i can't really recall any bad times we had with each other. i guess i'm refering to more of the ugly drama that unravels when the opposite sex gets involved..haha no offense boys.  anywhoo...pebs, tazzy, mimz, and livvy...from the bottom of my heart..i want you all to know that the times spent with you guys are unforgetable.. i can't remember ever having a dull moment....even when we're just chillin' like villians. just imagine..it's only april and we've already made a thousand memories..who knows what's in store for us..you never know..we all might end up back at miyagi's dancin' on the bar...haha..next time...pebs and mimz..it'll definitely be your turn to shine.  sorry readers for all the sappy stuff but aunt flo must be visitin' soon.. well girls and boys..that's it for now...to be continued..(i have 5 months to catch up on..haha)

       gemini twins..happy 21st!  i can't believe you girls are 21. all i have to say is you better enjoy it while it lasts cuz it only goes down hill from here..hahaha!!!!! ok..please don't follow your sister's foot steps....drinking is bad for your liver, dancing can increase your calf size, and staying up late from a night of partying can cause wrinkles. too bad you girls didn't turn 21 earlier because i'm pooped...no more clubbin for me..ok maybe after this weekend. well here's a little note: drink, drink but don't forget to think and here's another one: my friends are brutal when it comes to making your birthdays an unforgettable one. drinks all around! happy 21st jujubean and panda bear. love you guys!

       history repeats itself...  i experienced a little piece of history last night..it was a horrible remembrance. i'm still in awe. it was happening again...all over again. i felt trapped..no where to run, no where to hide, and no way out. it felt like a slap in the face, a punch in the gut, a knife in the heart. it hit me hard...knocked me back to reality. what i realized after this experience was that i didn't learn from my past mistakes...i forgot about it..i forgot how it made me feel and i forgot the hurt and sadness my eyes once felt. i guess it's true that those who do not remember their mistakes are bound to repeat them. if i only remembered, then maybe...just maybe this reoccuring event would subside...

       the one...  after a couple of attempts to watch the matrix..we successfully accomplished our goal last night. we started it on sunday but i fell asleep 20 minutes into the movie...hehe (that's why i don't like watching movies at night :-)... so we picked up where we left off last night.  i watched it when it came out in the theaters a few years ago but i felt like i was watching it for the first time. i didn't remember a lot of it but that's no surprise. i just remember liking the movie. anyways, the question came up after the movie about how trinity could say neo was the "one" when they never even laughed together. it never really crossed my mind..i just thought she was one lucky duck to be making out with keenu.  just kiddin but to answer the question,  i said "the oracle told her that she would love only one man and it would be the one so that was why."   well that was my initial response but after putting more thought into it,  i guess it would be hard to love someone you barely even know but then again, you can't choose when love comes. it's unpredictable. yeah they didn't laugh together (which is a key ingredient to love), but they did fight the bad guys together and that brought them closer.  i dunno tho..i guess she felt "that" feeling that everyone feels when they are in love.   i've been contemplating about seeing a pyschic. i've always wanted to but just never had the chance. i think it would be really interesting to see what the fortune teller would say about my life and my future. hmm..maybe she'll tell me that the "one" will make me a princess..haha. ok well i'm all pumped and ready for matrix reloaded. i've heard good and bad reviews but if the special effects are anything like the first one, i think i'll love it.

       memories...  though i don't always write about the good times, doesn't mean i don't remember them! the memories of the warmth, the light, the smiles, the laughter, and the joy are all ingrained in my mind. and even if i chose to block it out, scared that the bad memories would re-surface, it'd be impossible and undesirable. those events that have taken place during the course of my life has shaped me into who i am today.  i wouldn't change it nor would i ever want to.   words that were left unsaid, were left unsaid for a purpose. and i agree, there is no point to hashing up something that has been buried for sometime.  in a way, i guess some of the memories i write about truly embody the phrase forgive but never forget...there's no deeper meaning..it's as simple as that.

       must be an asian thang...  during the early college years, the place to eat late at night was fridays (TGIF) for happy hour which started at 10 pm. we'd gather up our friends and spend the late night chowing down on half price appetizers. that's where the asians were at. after a year or so of that, someone introduced us to callahans....25 cent wings. what a deal!! you could order all the wings you wanted as long as you ordered in groups of 5 for only a measely 25 cents or maybe it was 30 cents..i can't remember..it's been so long. anyways, the wings came in 3 different flavors... you could get mild for the weak, hot for the bold and fire for the brave.  so there we were, every wednesday night chomping on wings. hey it was cheap and we were starving college students.  i guess the word caught on because soon all the asians were eating there as well. you know...it was kinda like e-street..you started see the same people every time...  so anywhoooo, the reason why i'm blogging about this is because last night we had another revelation. i think another trend has started.  no more half price appetizers and no more cheapo wings. we've moved up in the food chain ladder. it's all about the lobster now.  $9.95 for 1lb lobster at the boathouse (located in shelter island) every wednesday night. my friends and I have gone so many times that last night someone (i won't say his name..*ahem* ricky) got a little to excited and ate way too many lobster cabezas and got sick. :-(  awww...poor baby.  but that's not the point. the point is we saw so many asians there last night. u should have seen it...asians gallore..i think we're taking over the world. all you have to do is mention the word "free", "half off", "buy one get one free", "sale", or "$9.95 lobsters" and they're there. it was too funny. the word is definitely catching on. so we're now eating at upscale restaurants. we're moving up. *sigh*.. maybe onami or todai will follow the trend and throw in some specials on thursday nights. something like "if you're name is tiffani..the meal is on us :-)"..ahhhh...what a wonderful idea! but i doubt it..only in my dreams right?!?

       distance makes the heart grow fonder...  i was chatting with my girlfriend the other day and we were comparing our different views on missing people. she said that she loves to miss her toy..i mean boy. haha. anyways, she said that the feeling of missing someone portrays how much you really like the person or how much that person really means to you. she loves that feeling of missing cuz when she finally sees him, she's on cloud nine. i on the other hand did not like that feeling at one time... i didn't care much for the whole missing saga. yeah...i thought it was great when you got to see him again after sometime but the lag time in between the next visit..awww..definitely a killer.  let's see... my friend see's her man everyday...and i really mean everyday cuz they work in the same building. so the only time she doesn't see him is when she's home, so the time in between missing him is fairly short cuz she'll see him again the next day.  she enjoys missing him and i've come to believe it's because the time in between is not long enough where it starts to hurt.   i've been in one long distance relationship and at first it wasn't too bad. i saw him very weekend but then slowly the visits were less and less. it became every other week, every three weeks, and eventually it seemed as if it was once in a full moon.  k..i'm exagerrating but it was hard to be apart and i didn't like missing him. but i also think it had to do a lot of with trust issues. i didn't trust him but then again..he gave me reasons not too. and the gut wrenching feeling i would have everytime we talked..gave me bad vibes but that's a closed topic. anyways, getting back on the topic...i think it's true that distance makes the heart grow fonder but only if you have complete trust in other person. if you don't have it, it will definitely hurt because you'll always be wondering if the person is doing you wrong behind your back or what not.  trust is what makes a relationship hold true. it's the peanut in the m&m, the sourcream in the carne asada burrito, the lobster dipped in butter, the boba in the avocado shake and of course, the pumpkin in the pumpkin smash.    this time around, my feeling towards missing someone is a bit different. i don't feel the pain, i don't feel the hurt, and i don't feel the suspicions. what i do feel is a sense of sadness when he's away. i don't see him everyday like most people who are in relationships but the time that we are apart, he is still in my heart and that makes me happy, so i smile.  i guess missing someone isn't  so  bad. :-)  the distance has definitely made my heart grow fonder.

       life after college...  i remember the all-nighters i use to pull, cramming for exams and working on projects. i use to get real sick all the time right before finals. i think the stress really did a few numbers on me. i also remember how much i wanted school to be over so i could finally enjoy my life. i felt my life was at a stand-still until i was done. i always had school on my mind. if i was hanging out with friends, i never gave my undivided attention cuz in the back of my mind, i'd worry about if i finished that homework assignment or how much work or studying i'd have to do.  it sucked. at times i wanted to give up, especially during my master's program. anyways, it's all behind me now and you know what?!? my life is almost as peachy as i thought it would be. i'm traveling here and there, seeing things i've never seen, doing what i've always wanted to do, studyfree weeknights and weekdays, working on my tan, spending time with loved ones, experiencing a whole new side to life, daydreaming into tomorrow...the only problem now is WORK.   i guess i never really thought about how much of your time is put forth working. you spend most of your time there, 10 hour days, 5 days a week. ewww.. but at least i get every other friday off. that's probably one of the main reasons why i'm still here.  i can't even fathom waking up at 6AM everyday to go to work until I retire.  i'm getting tired just thinking about it. it wasn't too long ago where i loved coming to work, maybe because i had the coolest boss. i would come in at 9 AM work a couple hours, go to lunch at 11 for about 2 hours, and then come back to the office only to work another 2 hours before he let me go home. now that's what i call a job.  but those days are over and i'm now working in what they call corporate america. i think i wouldn't mind it so much if i was treated like an adult but they still treat me like a kid. the old ladies still hate me, the old men still gawk at me, and i'm still under-paid.   i've made a huge decision...i've been contemplating this for awhile and i keep coming back to the same outcome. here it goes... i  want to become a princess. yeah me! it would be so much fun. i wouldn't have to work and i can play all day long.  i think i'd be a good one too. yes..my career goal has definitely changed..old career goal: be the CEO of my own company. new goal: become a princess. some my friends already call me that and i would very much like to fill those shoes..they have such high expectations ofe..hehe. i can't let them down... i must become one.  princess tiffani.  has a nice ring to it huh?!?. ok i know you all think i'm crazy or dorky but i'm only doing what i was taught and that is to dream big.  life as a princess...now that's what i call life after college.

       commitment phobic..who me??  at 23, i feel like i'm still a kid. yeah, i'm done with school and i have a good job and the next logical step is to find a mate and get married..well that's what my grandparents keep telling me. yet i know my parents are so not ready to be in-laws and i'm not ready to be anyones wife. everytime i see my grandpa, he's always telling me that i need to find a husband..geez, i'm only 23 and finding the "one" that i'm meant to spend the rest of my life with, well isn't that easy. lately, the topic on marriage has been floating around. some of my friends are married or are getting married real soon. it looks like everyone is coupling off.  it's weird. it happens in bunches..first everyone is single and partying like there's no tomorrow and now it seems like everyone has someone.     for awhile, marriage and starting a family was so far fetched. not my favorite topic of discussion. i just couldn't understand why anyone would want to settle down so soon. maybe cause i'm not ready. i was talking to my friend stacy about that. she said that she knew she would marry her man a few years ago and she was just waiting for him to ask her. she's only 25 and she knew he was the one 3 years ago.  i'm amazed at that. i've been in 1 long term relationship and maybe a couple shorter ones worth remembering and i don't think i was ever ready. i would question the relationship, i would question the love, i would question him and i would question myself.  my friends would tell me that the reason i had so many doubts wasn't because i didn't love him, but because i wasn't ready and when i am, i will know. well i guess i wasn't ever ready cuz i never felt that feeling they were trying to describe to me.   don't get me wrong...i don't think i'm marriage phobic, but i do think i still have some growing up to do. it's not like i never want to get married even tho after my break up, i was anti boys for the longest time..hehe. but i'm over that now and i can finally see a glimpse of my future and i'm looking forward to the journey that is before me.  i've always known what my wedding day would look like all the way down to the itty gritty details.  i know it will be purely magical and will be everything i've always imagined. it will definitely be my dream come true and hopefully his as well. but there's no rush because like i've always said, timing is everything and when the time is right, everything will slowly fall into its place.

       timing...  i've come to accept that everything has to do with timing. everytime something would happen or would not happen, i'd say it had to do with the time and it just wasn't our time, and with this mentality, it keeps you sane. i've been through my share of heartaches and all the tears i've shed has only made me stronger. each time my heart gets broken, it never really completely heals, and when it breaks again, the cracks are always different.  people always say that once you get hurt, it doesn't hurt as bad the second time around. i agree with that belief but only to a certain extent.  the second time, the third time, whatever the case may be, the pain still stings, the tears still burn, the heart still aches. it doesn't hurt any less but the way you cope is different. you know better, you've learned from past experiences and you know life goes on. so dealing with the pain is easier but the hurt still stings to the bone.   i think this past weekend proved to me that everything really does happen for a reason. but sometimes the reason may be different than what you expected and it just takes time to see that.  a few months ago, the timing was right for that purpose, a month ago the timing was not right but yet we knew our time would come so we held on.  after awhile confusion, misunderstandings, innocence began to plague our minds. and with a blink of an eye..it was dark again. dark and alone. i couldn't understand what happened or why it happened but i knew that it happened for a reason. i came up with reasons why which helped me deal but the fact was that after some time, the reason for it happening became crystal clear. it was in the cards, our cards. and even though we both felt pain, it had to happen for us to open up our eyes and see what really matters. and in all honesty, i'd suffer that pain again if that meant that it was the only way we could get to where we are right now.  i guess you could say the timing couldn't have been more perfect.

       40 days and 40 nights...  so for lent my roomie and i gave up carbs...not all, but the major ones like bread, rice, pasta, potatoes, and sweets (fudgcicles, cookies, peanut m&m's, chocolate, cake, etc.). we got this brilliant idea after watching "40 days and 40 nights" (josh hartnett..mmm' definitely a hottie). anyways, after watching that flick, we decided to give up something that we both love and you all know what i love most..EATING. so we crazy girls decided to suffer 40 days without yummy, delicious, high carb foods to prove that we have will-power.  yeah i know i'm not catholic..shoot, neither is she...but this gave us a reason to cut out the bad carbs and at the same time, lose a little weight.    week 1 - first week without any high carbs..yup no rice...heaven knows how much we love rice and a day without it..it was indeed a sad day. but we survived. we started eating lots of green veggies and chicken.   week 2 - we started feeling a little weak. we were slowly runnin' out of energy but that didn't stop us. we kept to our word and also started exercising regularly. running about 3 times a week around miramar lake. that kept us going...  week 3-  hmm..not so bad. don't miss rice, don't miss pasta, don't miss potatoes, but damn what i would do for a loft of bread and my thin mint girl scoot cookies that are hidin' in the back of my freezer.   week 4 - we decided to eat bread at least once a week because someone told us if we eliminate it from our diet completely and start eating soon after our diet, we'd blow up like balloons...heck..that scared us so bread it was..but only once a week.  week 5 - we're still runnin' almost every other night. our motivation still prevalent. we felt good about ourselves because we were eating healthy and exercising. only 2 more weeks to go...  week 6 - uh oh..i think i started breakin' down by week 6..it had to be disneyland..i couldn't eat anything else but high carb foods... that's all they sold. it's notmy fault..so it was ok. funnel cake, churros, ice cream, cheeseburger, fries, chilli dogs, potatoe chips..man i was in heaven. so there we were..eating everything insight. yeah i felt a little guilty but it tasted so good that the guilt went away real fast. :-)  WEEK 7 - last week and where am i?!? in vegas..damn..there goes my will power...mine and tazz. we only had 2 more days to reach our mark and we couldn't even do it. i needed pizza..a fat mushroom, pepperoni and olive pizza. mmm'. it was simply heaven. and so our lent ended a couple days before our target date of april 20th (for those who think that i lost at week 6, remember i'm not counting disneyland..it wasn't my fault..u don't expect me to starve do u? :-)   since then, we've been eating like crazy and we stopped exercising. i really do miss running around the lake but these days it seems like i have an excuse for everything and anything not to go. our motivation is completely gone. also during those 40 days, we said we'd stop eating rice even after lent..but we didn't. it's back in our tummys. i think i need to find something else to do..i'm bored. i wanna do something spontaneous..something crazy. the only problem is..i don't know what. maybe for now,  i'll just chill and watch the sunset and the sunrise...*smile*

       and we're off!!!!  our long awaited vacation is finally here. in about 16 hours, we will be on a plane to the happiest place on earth..walt disney world. :-) yeah i know i'm still a big kid and i think i'll always have the kid in me. what can i say, i love dreaming and this place makes dreams come true. i think we'll prolly hit up all the major attractions...magik kingdom, epcot, mgm, and pleasure island which is located in downtown disney. you know what that means...clubbing woo-hoo!!!.  who knows, we might even end up taking a cruise to the bahamas. i'm seriously thinking about it. i have 10 days off..might as well make the most of my trip. yeah i know i plan trips way in advance but i never think about the details of the trip until last minute.  grrrr!!!!  and i get in trouble at times for not thinking but i guess that's just the spontaneity in me...at least that's what i'd like to think.    well i hope everyone has a great weekend and hopefully when i come back from florida, i'll brag..i mean blog about how tan i am. :-) byee!!!

       my ideal date...  i hate dating. it's definitely not my forte. i've always had a boyfriend or i was seeing someone...well since the high school days anyways. but last year i experienced the greatest thing ever, it was the best thing that could have ever happened to me and the timing couldn't have been more perfect.  that was being on my own. i was single as can be... a free spirited girl ready to take on the world. i had so many crazy moments...so many unforgettable memories.  i learned so much about myself and i realized how wonderful it was to be alone and to do things on my own and not feel one bit lonely.  i actually enjoyed spending time by myself.  i spent a lot of my days alone at the cliff on the beach. i dunno...there's just something so tranquil about watching the waves crashing on the shores and the sun setting across the horizon. it's amazing. it's beautiful. it's astounding. it made me happy.  anyways,  as much as i liked having my time alone,  i still hung out with the opposite sex. it's a funny thing. the 10 months i was single, i "hung" out with a few guys but never once did i consider them dates. yeah, we might have done the dinner thing but i made it clear to them..it wasn't a date. i guess i was a little harsh but i really didn't want to date anyone. there were times where i had to straight out tell them that we were just hanging out cuz they called it a date but it sO wasn't in my book....no no dates for me. i guess i wanted to make it clear to them cuz i didn't want to lead any of them on.  i really just wanted to chill and be single.    well as much as i hated dating, i found myself wanting to when i met ricky.  everyone knows how much i hate watching movies in the theaters. my girlfriends tried to get me to go forever but didn't succeed. but once ricky came into my life, i didn't even think twice about it. come to think of it, i think i asked him to the movies..haha. anywhoo..i'm here to prove a point that wanting something sucks cuz you just might get it. i was anti-dating for the longest time and finally when i felt i was ready, i think my prospect was scared to go on a date with me cuz we never hung out alone. we always hung out in big groups. yeah that was fun and everything but i really wanted the whole wine and dine me thing.  i guess that's what i get for telling guys i don't date. my bad. :P    i guess the main reason why i'm blogging about this is to share with everyone what my ideal date is. yeah i enjoy the whole wine and dine sha-bang so don't rule that out! haha. but what i imagine is him and me on top of a huge green hill...a waterfall behind us. the grass is a perfect shade of green, the sky is a sharp color blue with fluffy white clouds surrounding the gleaming warm sun. so there i am with him, butterflies in my tummy but all the same time i'm comfortable. he makes me laugh. we smile and we laugh again...we laugh until our stomachs hurt. it hurts so much that we both decide to roll down the soft green hill for fun. there we go tumbling down and finally when we get to the bottom there's a pumpkin smash jamba drink awaiting for us. we sip out of the same straw and splash our feet in the lake below us.  he then decides to take me to my favorite spot. a place i didn't even know he knew about. we sit on top of the cliff with our feets hanging over and watch the beautiful sunset. he looks into my eyes and smiles. i melt. and then to end the date, he gives me a warm bear hug and kisses me gently on the forehead.  *sigh*...now that's what a call a date. :-)

       taking risks part II  well if you guys are wondering what my dilemma is all about, it's the decision to move to seattle for a great job. those who know me have heard me say how much i love traveling. i love meeting new people, i love doing different things, and i love new challenges. this position would require me to relocate to seatlle, washington and would require me to be on 3-4 week assignments at a time in all different states. now this is what i've always wanted to do..travel for work. i'd be a consultant/trainer for companies/utilities that want to implement an enterprise wide software. it's a great job opportunity and what i've learned thru the years is to never let an opportunity to pass by, but in this case..i just might.  my career is very important to me. i've felt lost for awhile. i wasn't sure what my next steps were in life except to get married and start a family but i'm not financially ready for that. and emotional???...as much as i think i am..i'm not. but i know it's my career that i need to be working on. it's not something i can put a time frame on like school. with school, you can decide how long you want to take and you know when you will reach your goal . you have control over that. with your career, you don't know when you'll reach your peak. you have less control. you can work your butt off but you don't decide when you get a raise or promoted. it's not in your hands.   i just think the timing is all off. i just bought a house. i'm painting. i just put in shelves in my garage. i'm getting wood flooring this summer.  i'm having so much fun planning what i need to do next to the house. it's my baby. but if i leave, i'll have to rent it out because i don't want to sell it.  but my house is not the only thing holding me back.  i've recently completed my graduate studies and i'm ready to just relax and spend quality time with my friends and family. i want to go on more vacations. i want to sit back and read a good book. i want take naps on a hammock.   maybe i'm too much of a daddy's girl. i had a pretty deep conversation with my dad this past weekend about the job offer and he didn't seem too thrilled. even tho i'd get paid sO much more, he doesn't care...he wants me here and the more i think about it..i want to be here. my life is in san diego and my future is in san diego. i'll build my career right here in sd!! but i know that if i decide to go, they will always be here for me... both family and friends but i don't think i can stand being so far away. i'd miss everyone. *sniff*  but we'll see what happens.  this was my dream job but sometimes you have to let go of one dream to fulfill another. and right now, i'm definitely living one of my dreams.

       taking risks...  what do you do if opportunity knocks? do you take it or leave it? if you take it, your whole life will change. if you don't, you'll never know what could have been.   something big is going to happen and if i choose to go down that route, my life will never be the same.  it could be so risky that i might lose everything. am i willing to drop it all and take off? am i willing to be completely on my own? it's a big step for me but i think i've finally found what i've always been dreaming of. but then again dreams change....there are past dreams, present dreams and future dreams right? whoever said you couldn't change them.   i think i just need some time to sort out my thoughts, lay out all the factors on the table, list the pros and cons. it's a big step and who knows if this step will take me ahead or bring me three steps back. i dunno. i guess time will only tell...

       middle child syndrome  here's a little background on my childhood...5 girls and 1 guy. no brothers, 3 sisters, one older, the twins younger and a mom and dad. yep that's my family. we are one big happy family... the majority of the time but like all familes, we had problems...hmm..and what could that be???..yep..me..i had the middle child syndrome.   looking back, i really think i made more mistakes than the average teenage. you wouldn't believe half the things i did and got away with and the other half that i got busted for but i'm taking those secrets to my grave. hey..kids will be kids. anywhoo, i always got yelled at, always got in trouble, and i always rebelled. i was such a brat. i can admit that now. but you know what the funny thing is, everyone at school thought i was the sweetest person, the most innocent of them all..i even got selected as sweetest personality for my highschool yearbook. haha..what a joke. k..don't get me wrong..i'm not a meany but i don't really think anyone really knew the real me except for my family. they saw me at my worst, they saw the spark in me die, they saw the blank stares in my eyes, they saw the turmoil in the pit of my stomach, and they saw me grasping for air. and no matter how much i hurt them with my actions, they were always there for me and i know they always will be and vice versa.    this is hard for me to admit but i'm gonna suck it up and let it out..i think the reason i made so many mistakes not just because i was ignorant but because i was jealous...jealous of who you ask..well my sisters. here's the scoop..my older sister..smart as hell..valadictorian of her highschool, never got in trouble, always obeyed the rules, went to UCSD, never a disappointment. my younger sisters..well..they are twins..that should explain it all but i'll elaborate anyways. being twins..you have instant attention, plus they were the babies in the family and they're super cute. and that leaves me..the middle child..not the smartest, not the cutest, and definitely not the one to follow rules. i guess the only way i thought i could shine was to make my parents life miserable..at least i got their attention right? heehee..jk..yeah i was an attention seeking brat. but i don't blame my parents...they loved us all the same...even though now i call myself their favorite..haha. so that's my story of my middle child syndrome. maybe now you all will understand me a little better and give me all the attention i need. you guys can even spoil me..i don't mind..not at all. haha :-) have a wonderful day everyone! *wink*

       "If You're Not The One"   by Daniel Bedingfield   "If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today? If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way? If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all  I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am? Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed? If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head? If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life? If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?  I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with And I wish that you could be the one I die with And I pray in you’re the one I build my home with I hope I love you all my life  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right And though I can’t be with you tonight And know my heart is by your side  I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am Is there any way that I could stay in your arms"  this is exactly the way i feel about you. never in a million years did i think i'd find myself here. but here i am and here you are. i guess it's true that if you wish for something long and hard enough, it will come true. all those nights praying, all those pennies at the bottom of the well, all my stars that have been wished upon, and all my daydreams  have finally paid off. i've fallen hard, harder than i could have ever imagine and i'm not scared. for the first time, i feel free...free to let my heart live, free to let it run wild, and free to let my heart love. all the endless possibilities with no restrictions. for the first time... i'm not scared..i'm not scared.

       dreams...  i rarely dream..yeah i know experts say that everyone dreams but i seriously never remember any of mine. but the times that i do have dreams and i can recall them, they're normally nightmares. i wake up sweating, i wake up scared, i wake up in shock.  i can clearly remember dreams of being attacked by bears or having a homeless man naw at my leg. i once dreamt that rats where mulitplying in dozens and i was trapped in my old room at my parents house.  i also have dreams of people being mean to me and in real life they've been nothing but sweet.  i've dreamt that i was being chased by guys with guns. i've dreamt of family members being really ill. i've dreamt of death in the family. i've dreamt of dead people. i can go on but i'm kinda freakin' myself out right now so i think i'll stop documenting my nightmares. anyways, i borrowed a dream book from a friend and i've glanced through it a few times but the way the author interprets my dreams, i don't fully agree with. i think a lot of it is mumble jumble..in my case anyways.  maybe i just need to get another dream book...nah..i just want to stop having nightmares.  i rather just stick to daydreaming...that's what i do best.

       another year older...  i've just celebrated my birthday...yup, i finally turned 21, three years in a row now..haha :-)  anyways,  i just wanted to thank everyone for the birthday cards, letters, emails, texts, phone calls, gifts, and of course the party.  special thanks to ricky for organizing the party. if it wasn't for you, i prolly wouldn't have celebrated my birthday this year. i'm just sorry that we got kicked out of the pool area (screw those neighborhood watch spies)but i think everyone still had a good time at the house.  i think i'm gonna write a letter to the home owner's association about those nosy neighbors.  i swear they have nothing better to do then to crash parties.   anywhooo...i had such a great weekend. again..i would say one of the best weekends. we made our way up the coast, wined and dined at my favorite restaurant..crusteaceans. mmm'!!!  strolled around beverly hills and of course made memories in the city where stars shine.  we also went to a wedding on saturday...a beautiful one in deed. stacy was just glowing. we danced the night away to music that would just take your breath away...(inside joke..*wink*)and then ended our night at the yardhouse downtown to catch up with old friends.  sunday was a blast, a gathering with some of the best people in town...party till the sun disappeared into the moonlight. i don't think it can get any better than this but i'm more than willing to accept it so keep the fun and happy times coming this way. thank you guys for making this year's birthday an unforgettable one. i couldn't ask for better friends.  so here i am, another year older and enjoying every moment of it....

       i got that loving feeling...  u know that feeling that you only hear about and pray that one day you'll feel it to??    i always hear girls or guys say "oh u just know..u get this feeling." man, in every relationship i've been in, i've always waited to see if i'd get "that" feeling and i never did. i think in away i was envious of people who did feel it. i wanted it. i wanted it to happen to me. i wanted to feel that magical feeling where you know he's the one. but this time around..i didn't expect anything. i took it as it came and only hoped for the best. i find that this approach to be a better way of living. if it happens, it happens but don't go looking for it.   i don't know what's come over me but i feel the sparks, i feel completeness, i feel true love.  it's changing my world around in ways i've only dreamed of. could it be? is it happening to me? when you least expect it? when you're not looking for it? i dunno but i'm not gonna question the feelings i feel. i'm finally happy. happier then i've ever been and that's all i ever wanted...

       everytime by janet jackson  "I'm afraid I'm starting to feel What I said I would not do The last time really hurt me  I'm scared to fall in love Afraid to love so fast Cuz everytime I fall in love It seems to never last  But every time your love is near And every time I'm filled with fear Cuz every time I see your face My heart does begin to race everytime  One half wants me to go One half wants me to stay I just get so all confused  I'm scared to fall in love Afraid to love so fast Cuz every time I fall in love It seems to never last  It's everytime It's everytime Cuz. . .  Everytime your love is near And every time I'm filled with fear Cuz every time I see your face Could it be that this will be the one that lasts? The fear does start to erase every time Oh could it be that this will be the one that lasts For all my times Ooh yeah For all my times"  this song reminds me of how i felt when we first started dating and i can still remember how scared i was when i realized how hard i was falling. i was practically in tears. but my fears subsided as our love grew stronger.  i'm no where near being a pro when it comes to relationships. i still say the wrong things, i still act on my emotions, i still let the little stuff get to me. but i will tell u this. i'm trying my best. i'm trying the best i know how and that's all i can do. i don't expect much anymore but i do have a lot of hope. and i do hope that "this will be the one that lasts."   listen to your heart, feel my heart...look into my eyes and feel the vibes.  i want you to know how i feel and want you to feel what i feel and then you'll know that what we have is real...so very real.

       fun times  i had the longest weekend this past 4th of july and might i add, it was indeed one of the best weekends i've had in a long time.  it all started thursday afternoon. i wasn't feeling my best so i called in sick that day. ricky called me early in the morning to see if i was doing better cuz the night before, i felt awful. i was a bit snappy due to the exhaustion from the pain i was feeling but he understood. anyways, going back to thursday afternoon, ricky informed me that he was taking me out to a nice dinner. it's been awhile since we've gone out and i was just so happy we were gonna spend some quality time alone...didn't matter where we were going, just as long as we went together.  he got to my house around 6:30. he rang the doorbell. i remember, my heart was beating a bit faster than usual and i felt the little butterflies flutter inside my tummy. as i opened the door, i was pleasantly surprised by a dozen long stem red roses with baby breaths. awww...one of my many favorites.  my eyes grew larger and all i could do was give him the biggest hug. i held on to him and didn't want to let go.  he then took me to this restaurant i've been wanting to take him to (him unaware of this)...ruth's chris steak house down by the harbor. i've never had such great steak and lobster before. we drank wine...ok..he drank most of the wine and we had the best view of the ocean. the waitor was excellent. everything was perfect. we even got our picture taken and a complimentary dessert from the waitor.  we went home that night, and all i could think about was how lucky i am i have him in my life. my roomie asked me why he did all that and if it was for a special occasion.  i smiled and nodded no.  it was just an ordinary day and that's the best thing about the whole thing.  he never ceases to amaze me. he always keeps me on my feet. he always makes me feel special. i know he's probably reading this right now thinking i'm way to sappy but i've never been so happy...for realz.   friday got even better. ricky threw a picnic for all of our families and friends  at poway lake. i finally got to see some special people that he had been telling me about. and he described them exactly as they were. we ate a grip, had cantelope juice for the first time, we got some sun, tazzy fell asleep, the boys played football, i was the cheerleader, we also played volleyball and yes our team won, 3 out of 5 games.  and of course i got to see fireworks with my sunshine. i loved every moment of it. the smiles on everyone's face, the jokes, the horsing around, the keep away from ricky game...you have to admit..that was pretty funny, and of course being introduced to everyone as "ricky's girlfriend".  geez, i think i heard that a million times.." that's ricky's girlfriend everyone!"  just wait until you go to one of my family parties..the last one didn't count!  the tables will definitely be turned.  anyways,  i had a blast. this is definitely one 4th of july i'll treasure forever.   it didn't just end there, spent saturday afternoon with a group of friends and watched charlies' angels. it was very entertaining. kept me laughing for awhile. we ended the night at the cheesecake factory and i had the most delicious cheesecake..banna cream...mmm' delish!    alright, sunday finally rolls around and i go ocean kayaking with another group of friends. it  was my first time and i have to say, it was super duper fun. ricky did most of the rowing, so it was pretty easy.  we went into the caves and saw orange fishes. arnold decided to jump out of his kayake and go snorkeling...let's just say the water was filled with kelps and it looked kinda dirty but hey..whatever floats your boat. :-)  we had kayake races, and some of us had a little too much fun getting other people soaking wet. just wait till we go again. i'll be prepared!  after that, we went home and took a 6 hour nap, ricky made me dinner and we watched "the little princess". a perfect way to end a perfect weekend.   so there you go...that's my very eventful weekend with some of the people i love most. i wonder what next year's 4th of july will be. i think it will have a hard time beating this years. thanks ricky for the fun times. you definitely know how to bring a smile to this girls' face. :-)

       -the cycle of friends-  it’s weird to think how friends come and go. there was a time in my life when it was filled with their laughters, filled with their smiles, filled with their spirits and filled with their love. some of my fondest memories…just to list a few…  the drives up the coast, the spontaneous trip to magic mountain at 3 pm  in the afternoon, the karaoke night when we sang duets, the nights at bar dynamite, the conversations that lasted for hours, the 10 mile runs around calle cristo ball, the nights partying until the toilets became our best friends, the underage gambling in vegas, the 2am house painting brawls, and of course the most important…the friendship itself.     this list is not just memories shared with  one person but a collaboration of memories shared with friends that have come and go in my life. i’ve come to accept that friends are hard to find and good friends are even harder.  i think i’ve been very fortunate enough to have shared my life with so many people. but as another year goes by, another friendship will lose momentum.  for awhile,  i was questioning why this was happening, was it something I said or  did, or was it on their end. where did the fault lay, would things ever be the same,  would they ever  be a part of my life again. if they didn’t move away, would things stay the same. if their work wasn’t taking them in another direction, would there still be time for me,  if they weren’t tied down, would we still be friends. the questions are asked yet the answers are already known. so why do I grasp at straws trying to find these answers?  sitting here, my mind wonders, my thoughts typed out, my heart being heard.   i’ve come to believe that the reason why friends come and go is because they’ve already accomplished their purpose. whatever the reason may be for their presence, i’m grateful they came and touched my heart and left a mark because without each imprint, i wouldn’t be where and who I am today.  find yourself very lucky to stumble upon some friendships that last a lifetime but honestly, friendships like those are rare to find. As for the other friendships that come and go with the change in the season, i don’t find them any less important. for the short time they were in your life, the effect may have been greater than someone you’ve been friends with your entire life.  i can’t keep questioning. i just have to accept that and I have. i know they came in my life for a purpose and i’m not bitter that they’re gone. maybe a little sad but the memories I hold will always be ingrained in the back of my mind.  so with this said, my mind is more at ease. my thoughts are clear, my heart is free. and just to let you know, if you ever need a friend again, you’ll definitely find one in me.

       my sassy girl...   last night just took my breath away. god answered my prayers. there's so many firsts that i want to do with you, so many places i want to see with you and through your eyes. the possibilities are endless. day dreams fill my mind with so much hope. hopeless romantic that i am.  i keep telling myself that i need to take one day at a time but i can't help but to look into the future and what i see is you.   the weather was a perfect breeze, the location lit by love and innocence, in the midst of prospect. as your words left your lips, my heart skipped a few beats. my mind wonders off for a split second. a shock overcomes me. it's me that he feels for...and only me. i can't help but smile. i can't help but feel so very lucky.   everyday, i feel like i'm falling...deeper and deeper. there's no way out, no where to run, no place to hide.  and strangely enough, i wouldn't have it any other way.   last night left a very special memory in my heart. a smile, a glow, a forever image of true love in the making. it's not just me, my familiy sees it  and has said that they've never seen me happier. i only hope that i make you as happy as you have made me.  "my sassy girl" is a great movie. it sparks ideas and if taken with imagination, it may be your destiny.  i've been pointed in the right direction and fate has got me here but now it's up to me to control my destiny...

       a word from the wiser....  a good friend once told me "There are three important dates in your life. Today, tomorrow, and yesterday.  Your future belongs with "Tomorrow"  Learn from the past, remember what you did "yesterday" to improve how you live your life "today."   thanks for your encouraging words. i think your optimistic views are beginning to shine through me. let's keep the hope....

       it wasn't the flu...  geez..i've been home all week...didn't go to work at all and you're prolly thinking i took another vacation or something...nope..i wish tho..i've been sick..sick as a dog. i thought i had the flu but i just got back from the doctor's today and she said that i have strep throat. that kinda thru me off. i had a fever all week and my whole body was aching but my throat wasn't bothering me at all so when the doctor said it was strep, i was shocked. well...she's the expert so i guess i have strep. hopefully these antibiotics will make me feel better. i'm such a baby when i'm sick..wahhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!   i just wanted to thank my sweetie for taking care of me. i don't know what i would have done without you. staying up with me, getting me medicine, feeding me, loving me when i look a mess, trying to make be freeze to death when i had the chills, the cold showers, the pampering...i'm so lucky to have you. thanks baby!

       if only you knew...  a blow to the heart, beating ever so slow the sound of her name kills but you don't know.  a painful remembrance of nightmares that came, dreading the sleepless nights but who's to blame.  unbearable at times, but i have to stay strong, my mind's not at ease, it's been going on for so long.  any negative remarks and a defensive mode appears, my stomach turns which is followed by hidden tears.  a love so rare that even the sun shines at night,  yet comparisions expressed, doesn't feel right.  there's only one diamond that lives in this heart so true, as for the gem in your heart, somehow makes me feel blue.  with a drop of a coin, my thoughts meander and fold, i can only hope that this feeling will soon be left in the cold  the touch of your lip, a sweet kiss of honeydew, i'm so in love with you, if you only knew....

       colors beyond the rainbow...  i love home depot...it's one of my favorite stores (never in a million years would i have ever fathomed saying that).  but yeah, i really think it's the best  thing to have ever happened to homeowners. ever since i bought my townhome, i've spent more days at home depot than my usual spot..the mall. you won't ever see me there anymore but guaranteed, you'll find me at home depot late at night.  i've been neglecting my store for a few months now only because i was preoccupied with other stuff...oh how i love detours..haha. but now, i'm back in action...ready to paint again, ready to re-model, ready to brighten up my place and give it some TLC.  you all have no idea how motivated i am this very moment and there is a reason for my madness. everyone around me is purchasing property...they'll are gonna be homeowners if not one yet. on sat, i went to see a friend's sisters townhome in carmel valley.   it looked just like a model home. they used earthtone colors for each room. and a couple weeks ago, i went to drew and michelle's condo located downtown...their home was also painted in amazing colors and fully decorated. it just got me thinking that i've lived in my place for almost a year now and all i've done was paint 3 bathrooms and these people have painted all their rooms and have finished decorating!! man, i'm so behind.  so last night ricky and i were up till 2 am, masking my living room but prior to that, we stopped by home depot for tape and books on paint colors, and then we stopped by barnes and nobles for decorating tips and paint color ideas and OMG...i can't believe all the colors we can choose from. there's like a thousand shades of white, yellow, red, blue...all the colors of the rainbow. we spent hours looking through the magazines, books and searching the net for colors. i thought it was hopeless to find the perfect color for my living room, but low and behold, the brocheres i brought home from home depot proved to be promising. i found the color...my color...the perfect color for my home and i found this in home depot's brocheres. yeah me!  tonight we're gonna paint...i hope it'll be a beauty...how could you go wrong with "nature's whisper?!?" yeah!

       ...live with it  it's been almost 2 years since i broke up with my ex.  i can remember it like it was yesterday and it's even stranger to think that so much has happened in-between.  it wasn't a good breakup. i tried to stay friends but he wanted nothing to do with me. i think i tried for almost a year before i gave up. i was caught up in a one way strive for friendship. looking back, i feel foolish for thinking he was mature enough to stay friends with me. but i don't regret trying because at least i can say that i tried on my part.   to this day, he still talks to my sisters, they still hang out ever so often, and he stills calls them.  at first, i was very bothered by this. if he didn’t want me in his life, why was he so adamant in staying friends with my sisters. that leaves a connection to me and as long as he is friends with my sisters, we’ll always be connected. i didn’t like the fact that he was still in my life when he made it clear he didn’t want to be. it would be a different story if he stayed friends with my sister and didn’t ask all sorts of questions about me. but he did. my sisters told me that every time he would call them, i was the topic of discussion. i know at times it made my sisters feel very uncomfortable and ultimately they became annoyed with his countless questions about my life. i don’t get it! if he just agreed to work on being friends after the breakup, i’d tell him about my life myself and he wouldn’t have to hear it from others. if he wants to hang out with them, i don’t care anymore but just be their friend and don’t try to get info out of them for your own benefit.   in away i feel sorry for him and i know shouldn’t. it just makes me a little uneasy that he knows my business.  he lost all rights to it when he decided he was better off not being my friend. i don’t really care anymore and i don’t think that’s harsh to say. i’ve tried all I could for almost a year and just got really sick of trying. i decided 1 year ago that it was his lost and not mine. he’s my past and that’s where he belongs. if one day, our paths should ever cross again, i’m not one to turn away from a friend but i’m also not one to take friendship lightly. it means a lot to me and i can tell you that it’ll take a long time to re-build a friendship that’s been destroyed. but one thing for sure... i’m definitely not holding my breath…

       religion...  everyone has there own beliefs...and regardless of what a person believes in, it's their own prerogative. we live in a world full of ignorant people who think there religion is the best and condemn those who don't believe in what they believe in. we live in a world with people who could care less about religion and think it's a crock of shit. and then there's people who are in between, the ones that believe in God but that's the extent of it.  i think i fall in the category of inbetween. i've never been very religous and honestly i don't really care to be. i grew up in a loving family and even though religion was not our strongest hold, we still managed to live our lives in a positive and loving environment. i think we all came out better than ok.  i guess what i'm trying to say is that regardless of what religion you are and if you're a strong believer or not, never knock it because everyone is entitled to believe in whatever they want. at one time, i thought some religions were cult like but who am i to say that it's wrong. i know absolutely nothing about certain religions but i what i do know is what's right from wrong and good from bad and if i don't agree with it, that's my problem.   i've come to realize that certain things i once believed in, no longer holds true. but the one thing that stayed consistent and strong was someone who's been there for me thru thick n' thin. you were my eyes when i was blind. you were my strength, when i felt so weak. you were my mind, when i was wrapped up in confusion. you were my heart, when i needed to forgive. you were my family, when noone was there. you were my friend who believed in me when others didn't. and for that, i will always be grateful. you're definitely a star in my eyes and every thing that you're going thru right now...school, work, personal issues, your studies, family, and friends, it amazes me that you still have time for me. you're a beautiful person and i just hope life treats you like the ruby that you are. with that said, i hope you find what you're looking for thru religion that i've found thru you, my family, and my love ricky.

       what a relief!!   there's so much going on in my life right now, i don't even know where to begin. i guess i'll start off by saying i just had the best sunday ever. who would have ever thought that sharing your happiness with the ones you love most could only bring a smile to your heart and theirs.  i can still feel my heart racing, my thoughts trying to make sentences, my lips trying to express my thoughts but the only thing uttered were "ums" and "uh".  i needed some help and suddenly, there you were... a vision of love from up above...i felt you with me. i felt you holding my hand. i could feel your presence and because of this,  i was able to share the most wonderful thing that has ever happened to me to someone who gave me life and showed me nothing but love.    i have to say that i feel a lift off my shoulders. it's free. i'm free. the unknown is finally known. i feel total and complete happiness. and i couldn't wait to share the news with you.   i love to make my friends and family smile. i love to see my one and only smile. it gives me joy to see that because what was said, it made your heart lit up like the gazillion stars in the sky. with my handful of true friends, my amazingly wonderful family and now you...my life could not be more complete.   a chapter of my life is now closed and a new chapter begins. it only gets better from here and i do have to say, i'm ready for whatever comes our way.

       good times..   you northern cal boys really know how to wear this so cal girl out...hehe. but i must say you guys are definitely a fun bunch and i'm very happy that you were finally able to make it down to good ol' san diego.  here's the scoop...  last weekend, i played host along with my love ricky. curtis, bren and sanford came down for the labor day weekend to visit. it was curtis and bren's first time being in san diego so the pressure was on. i had to show them what i've been bragging about for nearly a year now..how great sd is!  but anyways, what i thought would be mission impossible, actually was very obtainable.  i was pretty nervous to see the guys again...it's been so long but i knew that once we saw each other, the comfort zone would kick in and that it did.    day 1:  the first night they came into town, we partied with all of the san diegians in pb.  my girlfriends and guyfriends all came out to welcome the newbies to sd. we ate, drank, chilled, and ended our night dancing till our legs turned to jello. we had so much fun. the girls went crazy, the boys stared, and we got our groove on.    day 2:  the bay area people are very deprived...i'm sorry to say!  so therefore i had to take them to grub on "REAL" mexican food. we all ate california burritos from santanas...mmm' delish!  from the look of things, i think the boys enjoyed it cuz once we got back in the car, everyone looked really tired and that can only mean that your tummy was well fed.  then we made our way to la jolla...chilled at the living room, walked around prospect street, went to the cove and of course watched the little seals hit on each other. it was pretty funny.   as the sun went down, the nightlife began. we strolled downtown and let the boys experience one of the very few "good" clubs in sd (if there is even one). we had dinner at on broadway as the band played in the background. i thought that was pretty cool. we had front row seats too. hehe. anyways, i hope you all enjoyed the club.   day 3:  sunday...the day we got bren on rollerblades. it was definitely a kodak moment and i jumped to the opportunity to take those pictures...hmmm blackmail...jk!  but seriously, all of us went blading on the boardwalk down at mission beach. it was hilarious to see you all skate and ohhhhh...the fall...hehe... don't worry, i won't mention any names. *wink* anyways, the weather was perfect and curtis finally got to see the beach on a sunny day.  well i hope you guys all had fun cuz all my friends here really enjoyed hanging out with you guys. i promise next time we'll fulfill bren's needs and wants...we'll definitely take you to the zoo bren, so no more whining! :P good times...yup definitely!  all i have to say now is mission completed...... :-)

       happy halloweeeeeeeeeeeeen!!  for those out there who still have the halloween spirit, i wanna wish ya all a happy and safe halloween!!!  i love this time of year, the change of the season...which can only mean... cold crisp nights, warm fires, hot chocolates, getting lost in your bed with the covers and pillows, snuggling up to someone special, leaves changing colors, snow, snowboarding, and of course the best thing of all pumpkin smash. :-)  it's back guys....my all time favorite "happy" drink. i think i really need one right about now. it does the trick every time. it always brings a smile to my face. i remember last winter, i had pumpkin smash twice a week. i tried so hard to o.d. on it because i knew it was only a seasonal thing and i didn't want to miss it but my mission failed. my addiction only grew stronger.  people think i'm nuts that i can get this excited over a drink but if they only knew how yummy it is and how much happiness it can bring. i blame my obsessiveness on the one and only "munkie boy". ever since my first smash two years ago, i've been addicted to it. he's the blame to my insanity. now munkie boy...if you are reading this and fully agree with me about the drink...then i know i'm crazy. hehe. k..gonna get some smash...(*grin*)

       random...  nothin' ever stays the same and though you wish that it would, things just don't ever work out the way you think it would. this year has definitely been a challenge for me...i take that back...every year is a challenge and i guess that's all part of growing up.   it's 5 am and i'm awake...this time change really sucks...i can tell already it's gonna be a long day. i'm tired of blogging. i can't think with this fire. i can't breath with all the smoke i'm inhaling. that reminds me... i had a dream the other night that my parent's backyard was on fire....thank god it was only a dream....sometimes i think my whole life is a dream...yup..that's me..tiffani living in her own little dream world...damn realilty bites!

       it's all part of life....  i'm a very strong believer that everything happens for a reason but sometimes i wish that things never happened. last nite i had dinner with my ex. the first time i've seen him in almost a year. he lost a lot of weight... not that he was ever fat but his reason for losing weight was because he wasn't with me anymore. geez..i guess i do eat a lot which makes whoever i'm with eat a lot too. :-( but that's besides the point...my mind has been spining in circles and my heart can still feel whatever little pain he still has left. i know he's trying to be my friend and that's all i ever asked for. it took him 2 years to finally let me back in his life and after talking to him last night, i understand why it took so long. i know i didn't make it any easier for him all those times i would call him but i can't do anything about it now. i just wish the best for him and i hope he knows that. things are finally moving on.  we both got our closure and we both know where we stand...as friends.

       my skylla...  sunday marked my first day of snowboarding this season and i have to say boy was i rusty!  i got to the top of the mountain and as i looked down the slope, i froze. holy shit...what the heck do i do??? i totally forgot how to snowboard! how sad is that?!?  but i did make it down the mountain with the occasionally tumbles which was cool because i wanted to get a feel for the snow you know?…heehee.  so after that, we went on the lift again, back to the top but this time i did a lot better. i was able to pick up my snowboarding abilities that i left behind in tahoe last winter but i’m sure some of you would beg to differ. :P  anyways, we got in about 6 runs, which is pretty good considering it was a busy sunday.  oh yeah, i rode my new baby too, it’s a k2 skylla board and it’s purty, a real purty red. k..that's it...see ya all on the slopes!

Amen!

       good for the soul...  last night i went to see "elf" with some friends i haven't seen in awhile. i felt a little uncomfortable and a bit nervous at first. i wasn't sure what judgements they have made if any at all. the awkward feeling stayed with me and i felt it radiating from them as well. finally the movie started and everything was forgotten. for 2 hours, i got lost into the movie. it was hilarious. i can't remember the last time i laughed so much from a movie. i love comedies and ooohhh how i love romantic comedies even more. anyways, after the movie, we all re-grouped but this time the awkwardness dissipated. everyone's spirit was lifted. i think the movie did us all some good. yup laughter is the key to a happy life and laughter with friends, even better. so if you wanna enjoy some good laughs, go see "elf". it did me wonders. :-)

       in limbo…  what if you knew you were doing wrong but it felt so right? could doing what’s wrong be right? Or could doing what’s right be wrong? my heart and my mind do not coincide.  opposing teams both striving to triumph over the other for at the end a decision will be made. it’s usually anyone’s game but this time it appears that both teams may lose or win. i’m hoping for the latter….

       where's my head??  i think i've developed a case of stupidity. there must be a huge whole in my head where my memory use to be stored. i can't seem to remember anything.  i've done a lot of airheaded things lately...you know like looking for my keys when it's in my hand or even worse, when it's already in the lock to the car.  get this, i did it twice, once at my house and another time at my parents...yup...on christmas eve, i left my keys in the lock to the trunk of my car.  one of my neighbors knocked on the door around 9pm to point out that some idiot left the keys on the lock to the trunk. let's just say my parents weren't thrilled by the visit.   then i lose/misplace my free southwest ticket for utah. yep..snowboarding in park city! i tore up my room looking for it. i was seriously stressed out for a week. i called southwest last week to see if they could help but they said i would have to contact rapid rewards but they wouldn't be open until monday...that's today. so i called early this morning. anyways, to make a long story short, my free ticket turned out to be ticketless so a ticket was never really sent to me...it was just a notification letter. dammit..i knew i should have read that letter. yes...i've been worrying and causing problems for nothing. i'm sorry. =(  wait, there's more...but do i really want to share it...nah..i think that's enough for today. i really hope this is just a phase i'm going through and that my memory will come back so no one will ever compare me to jessica simpson again. how sad is that?!?

       looking back on 2003...  the year started off with a bang! with not a care in the world, single as can be, i danced the night away with kimball collins. met a few strangers, got silly drunk and still managed to make it home solo.  the winter months consisted of partying every weekend. that was our love..we had the energy, we had life, we all had something in common, a joy in dancing, feeling the vibe, and letting go. at times, i miss those days.  spring blossomed a love so beautiful, which can be compared to the rarest diamond but even with the most exquisite diamond, there's imperfections which this beauty definitely had. but it was all worth it and if i had to go through it again, i'd do it in a heartbeat.  fall was a cold month and i'm not just talking about the weather. the truth revealed ugliess i didn't know existed. i could have lived without this but it happened for a reason and that i have to remember.  and now here i am again...approaching the end of the year. it's been a heck of a ride. a year of change. a year of love. a year of loss. a year of happiness. a year of rekindle friendships. a year of accomplishments. a year of life!!! i've learned a lot this year and i'll take everything i've gained with me in the new year and the baggage will definitely stay behind. and with that said, i want to wish   everyone   a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!!! i wish you all the best in 2004. XOXOXOX!!!!!!

       where's the spunk in me?  ok, last night i went to bed at 8:30 and woke up at 6:30. the night before, i did the same. that's 10 hours of sleep!!  on average, i sleep about 8 hours a night. things are definitely changing. sleep is becoming more important to me...or more of a necessity.  i remember not too long ago, i slept 3-4 hours a night....insomnia plagued my mind or i was just out playing. i miss those days where i didn't need to sleep. i remember doing so much more after work but nowadays, i come home...whip up something to eat, shower, and jump into bed and snooze till the next day. the only thing that keeps me going is the thought of the weekend. i love my weekends...i cherish every weekend. these are the times where i have my fun and feel alive again.  i'm just hoping my week days won't be like this for the rest of my life cuz that's no life.  oh, did i mention that my weekends will soon consist of only saturdays and sundays ...no more fridays off. =( so basically i'll be sleeping a whole lot more and having a little less fun since fridays are now shot.  somehow i need to find away to make my weekends longer. hmmm....i guess i'll be calling in sick a lot starting january. =) haha.

       drifting along...  i can't think of any earth-shattering events to blog about. i have nothing to share. no exciting news. all i do is work, eat, sleep and snowboard. and to tell you the truth, that's all i care to do. don't really wanna club, don't really care to shop, don't wanna go to the gym...i've become a lazy bum. maybe it's the weather. maybe it's the people. maybe it's the life i've made for myself.  i've already accomplished most of the goals that i've set out but the one goal i've been striving to achieve for over 24 years have still not panned out. i'm tired of trying, i'm tired of workin my ass off and not getting what i deserve, i'm sick of broken promises, and i'm disgusted by politics.  sometimes i just feel like throwing up my hands and walking away but i won't. i won't let them win.   so i guess my life will keep truckin on untill that day comes when life is free...when i'll be my own boss...

       blah, blah, blah, blah...  "blahging" is a powerful tool. it can help get a message across through a fairly easy channel. but what if the person you're trying to get the message to doesn't even read your blog? or maybe that person does but you'll never know because that person chooses to stay quiet, which kinda sucks. i feel so BLAH!!!!!!

       i'm no stick?!?  so last night i went out drinking with the guys and i have to say they're definitely a crazy bunch. who knew that older men could have fun and not be perverted. a group of men at my work go out all the time for happy hour and always invite me but i always turn them down. but yesterday was different. i decided to join them and i'm happy i did.    i was a bit uneasy at first about the idea of partying with my coworkers especially the top level managers and with two of the chief officers. but as i sat down, i felt very comfortable. everyone was happy, everyone was just being themselves. no politics, no talking shop, and no stress.  it was great. so i ordered myself a fruity drink. everyone was shocked. no one thought i drank and when they saw me, everyone just cheered me on, so we toasted and toasted and toasted...to what...to toast so i'd drink up.  anyways, i started having a side conversation with one of the managers and he was telling how one of the ladies at work would give me dirty looks behind my back. he said that when i'd walk by, she would look at me and grunt..."uhhh".  he told me this particular lady in his department was jealous of the younger ladies at work. sorry that i'm not an old fat fart but geez...there's no reason to be nasty. then he looked at my plate and said "you don't eat much huh?" lol....little does he know i'm a P-I-G. i tried telling him that i do eat a lot but he wouldn't listen...he just kept calling me skinny and then he said "You're a STICK! Ever since i've known you...you've been a STICK!"   what the hell?? that's like the worse thing you can say to a women.  yeah..i've been sick a lot this year and lost weight but i don't think i'm sick-stick looking. :-(  i'm sure there's guys out there that like the olive oil look like popeye but i personally like meat on a women and i'm sure most guys do too.   anywhooooo, it was fun..quite interesting i have to say. i think the highlight of the night was when one of the chiefs asked if i order a "new england ice tea"....NEW ENGLAND???? i think he meant LONG ISLAND...it was hilarious...you just had to be there.  trust me...i won't ever let him forget that.   till our next happy hour escapede...cheers!

       a perfect fit...  i've experienced something so amazing the last couple weeks that i'm just simply overwhelmed with such a desire to somehow explain my revelation. i'm not sure if i completely understand it myself but i think by seeing it before me may help. so here's my first shot...  since highschool, i've always had someone..either a guy i was crushing over, a guy i was dating, a boyfriend, or just a bunch of random guy best friends. i've always been surrounded by friends and family. i was never really alone and if i had a broken heart,  i knew my friends would be there to help pick up the pieces and fill the empty void.  i know that i never wanted to be alone. i was always on the go...always had something to do and somewhere to be. but lately my motivation has fallen and i just don't care about a lot of things that were once important to me.  alone and lonely are two distinct words. i've never been alone but i have been lonely and these past weeks have been very difficult for me to breath. i was finally alone. just me, myself and i.  honestly...it was very hard at first. i couldn't sleep and i couldn't eat...now those who know me, know those are my hobbies.  but after a few days of being alone, things began to change. my outlook transformed before me and being alone became more of a blessing.  last saturday, i spent the day on my porch. it was a beautiful sunny san diego day. i plopped myself on my papason chair and let the sun consume my body. i felt so at peace. my mind wandered and finally things started to make sense. the puzzle i've been playing with all these years finally came together except for one piece. but that piece is not in my possession and only the person who has it, can complete the puzzle.   but there is no mystery who this person is. he's been with me all along even when I was alone. only now has it become crystal clear.  i'm no longer in a confused state of mind. i'm not alone. i'm more sure than ever about my feelings, about myself, about what i want and what i need. all those days of trials and tribulations have finally been defeated. i'm not gonna fight it because i've already won.    being alone has proven to be the best thing that could have ever happened to me. yes, i was miserable at first but like they say...without sacrifice there's no such thing as success.  i've realized that you are the piece to my puzzle and i hope one day, you'll take that piece and put it together because in my heart..it's a perfect fit.

       "With You"  The real me is a southern girl with her Levis on and an open heart Wish I could save the world, like I was super girl The real me used to laugh all night lying in the grass just talking about love But lately I've been jaded life got so complicated  I start thinking about it, I almost forgot what it was like To know what feels right 'Cause with you I can let my hair down  I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you  With you, with you, with you Now that I'm with you  You speak and it's like a song And just like that all my walls come down It's like a private joke just meant for us to know I relate to you naturally Everybody else just fades away Sometimes it's hard to breathe Just knowing you found me 'Cuz I start thinking about it, I almost forgot what it was like To know what feels right 'Cause with you I can let my hair down I can say anything crazy I know you'll catch me right before I hit the ground With nothing but a T-shirt on I never felt so beautiful Baby as I do now Now that I'm with you With you  Come and take me Love you save me Like nobody else Now I can be myself With you

       a prayer...  i see it in her eyes. i can feel it from her touch.  i know it in her heart.  the light shines but all the same time, the light dims. it's dark.  she's lost. she can't find her way back. it's dark. she believes she's dying. her body becomes numb. she's grasping for air. the pounding of her heart multiplies. the pain becomes unbareable. someone help her! God help her!   i sit and feel dazed and a little angry at times. i sit and wonder and ask myself over and over "why her? hasn't she been through enough?"  all i'm asking is for this to stop. she doesn't deserve it. we all know she's a fighter. always have been but how many times does she have to prove herself. can't you see...it's killing her. it's killing us. and the worst part is not knowing what's wrong and even tougher is not knowing how to help. i wish i could take her pain away. i wish i could make it all better. i would trade places with her in a heartbeat. i see her before me and i'm dying inside but i put up a front for her sake. i can't crumble.  she needs all of us to be strong. we will try our hardest but that means you have to pull through this one.  i believe in you like you believe in us.   at one point in my life i stopped believing in God. but as i'm getting older, i know that all the bad things in my life was not God's doing. it was my own. i don't blame him...not anymore. i'm a believer and although i do not go to church or temples...i still pray every night so that must count for something. so please out of the thousand prayers i say each night,  i really hope you listen to this one.

      i'm back..back on my traveling kick. i won't be going on any long trips but definitely i'll be on mini vacations as often as possible. who knows where i'll go. the skies the limit. i'm aiming for utah...again...and hopefully this time..mission will be completed. i love traveling..it's my passion and to have someone who loves traveling as much as i do, is just heaven. with you, it doesn't matter where we go..it doesn't have to be extravagent. i don't need europe, i don't need asia, i don't need the tropics. that can happen later and if it never does, i don't care. what makes a great trip is the experience of something new with someone worth it. and all these mini weekend getaways that we take, are awesome...simply unforgetable. you're awesome!! let the adventures continue!!!!

      i almost forgot that there are genuine people out there. i almost forgot that someone can touch your heart without really knowing they did. i almost forgot that friendship can be forever lasting. i almost forgot that i really do have true friends. i've met a lot of people and have made a lot of friends along the way. i've seen the ugliest side of some and the beauty in others. it hurts to know that some friends stabbed you in the back and never looked back. it's like you served a purpose for them and now that you're not needed, it doesn't matter. too many fakes out there i tell you. and then you start thinking that maybe all your friends are capable of deception. but then one day, you open your eyes and see that not everyone out there is like that. a couple nights ago, i had a heart to heart conversation with my girl. and she started talking about her life, boys, friends, and family. we laughed and we cried. i felt a connection and the light went on...she's been there all along and i didn't see it. she was the pillar to my strength. my crazy, sexy, cool partner in crime. she loved me for all of me and had my back the whole time, especially when others looked the other way. i think i've made a mistake by believing that friends like that do not exist. and now that i see what i should have seen months ago, i know i'll never let go. it goes deeper. the rarest of friendships. i don't think she knows it but i know she feels it. it's nice to know that even when words are not said, you know the friendship is forever there. i love ya girlie girl!!

      ok, this had to be the best snowboarding trip i have ever been on. it was perfect. it snowed all week long and stopped when we got there so we got to board in perfect sunny weather and on fresh powder. i got to know ricky's friends a lot better...more than i ever wanted. at least i'll be prepared for next year's trip. Note to self: No chilli dogs for the guys. I swear to you...our cabin stunk with fart bombs the entire weekend. anywhooo, what shall i share with you folks??? ahhh...i got wind burned and looked like a lobster. rielyn got drunk and also turned into a lobster. she became my twin. i found out that the guys take way longer to get ready then the girls especially keith. he is definitely a snowbunny. eric sucks at jenga..i think he had the most shots...poor poor boy. ricky is the chef of the group. jon smells and is two tone. joanne has the cutest googles...velvet..i think i want one too now. mary likes to board alone. no jumps for sherman. lynnda loves to drive. hey ricky!! she needs to go on all the long trips with us. hehe. damn..i had so much fun. the only thing disappointing were the parks...not enough beginner jumps and rails. maybe next year, mammoth will have better parks because i love to hit those jumps. i guess big bear will have to do until then..yes...i'm ready to hit the slopes again! one more thing to sum up this trip..." urlLink EAT QUIZNOS SUBS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"  here's the link to the clip in remembrance of our trip. play the clip...lol :P

      they say this city only has 60 days of sunshine a year. they call it the city that forever rains. they call it the suicidal city. i beg to differ. last week i went to seattle and just fell in love the first day i was there. the weather was nice and grass was green. i went on a rampage around downtown seattle. i hit the many malls, starbucks, pikes, space needle, toi's, dalihia's lounge, salty's, alkine beach, cinerama, and much more. seattle is just beautiful. from downtown, i could see mt. rainer and yes it looked like a huge scoop of vanilla icecream. and ohhhh the tulips..how i love tulips...they were everywhere and in every color you can think of. every night i was up till the wee hours in the morning and if you know me, i sleep hella early. i had a tough time falling a sleep...yup...i was sleepless in seattle. by the time my week was over, i was exhausted. i think one night i was up till 4am and had to get up at 6:30. it was bad but well worth it. i love traveling but man..as much as i love it, i also love being home. i missed my fishies, my house, and mom's home cookin', but most of all, i missed my BED! there's simply no place like home. but i shouldn't put my suitcase away just yet, i think i hear southbeach callin' my name. :-)

      &nbsp; there are way too many reality tv shows out there but i can't help to watch them. ever since i got cable, i've been watching more tv then I have in the pass 3 years. i'm addicted to american idol. jasmine rocks!!! linda thinks her georgie will win but come on on..his best move is the squat dance. anyways, i also watch newlyweds...it just cracks me up. Real World/Road Rules challenge is a must-see. and if that wasn't enough, i'm now stuck on this new show, "the swan". the swan takes average looking people and transforms them into beauty queens...it's kinda like extreme makeover. well i watched the episode on monday and i was just flabbergasted. this women. needed a tummy tuck after having only one baby. you should have seen her stomach..it was nasty. there was a lot of loose skin and i mean a lot! it just hung over her and sagged so far, i felt sick. ok..if this is what my stomach will look like after having a baby..i don't want one. she was only 27 and had just one kid and her belly looked like that. given, my mom had 4 kids but i've never seen her stomach. she always refused to show me. i asked her a million times but she always said no...now i know why. for all the women out there that are planning to have babies, here's a bit of advice..wear tight tops, short tops, halter tops, see through tops while you can before it's too late...cuz once you have that baby..say good bye to your nice stomach and cutsie tops unless you don't mind wrinkeled, sagging, excessive skin hanging out of your clothes. or you can always get a tummy tuck. :-)

      i've had a lot of embarassing moments in my life. some events i would never mention to anyone even if my life depended on it but for most of these moments, i think they're worth sharing especially if i'm still laughing about it.   on saturday, my friend invited me to a surprise birthday party for one of his friends. and although i've never met any of his friends before, i thought it would be fun to check it out. when i got to his house, my friend wasn't there yet and neither was the birthday boy. i walk into a room full of strangers and this guy introduces himself to me and then introduces everyone else in the room. he showed me around the house and shortly after, i plopped myself on the couch waiting for my friend to show up for the surprise. i looked down and i noticed that i was wearing my black sandals but i swore i was wearing white sandals. so i looked down at both feet and i saw my white sandal on my other foot. holy shit! i had a black sandal on one foot and a white one on the other. i thought to myself...no f*cking way am i wearing two completely different shoes. they weren't even the same height or the same style! one was dresser then the other. how did i not feel the difference? by now my heart was pounding, my mind was racing, and i could feel my face turning a rosy pink. all of sudden, i blurted out "hey look..i'm wearing two different shoes. it's the new trend. hahaha. ok.. (by now, my face has turned a bright shade of red) oh my god...um..i'm so embarassed. um..i live in my car and i slipped on the wrong shoes. ok.i'm gonna go to my car and get the other matching pair... hahaha. i'm such a dork." i then take off to my car to grab the other shoe. i know for a fact that after i left, the laughter probably increased by 110%. yes i'm an idiot. so i come back to the party and everyone is just laughing and i can't help but to laugh right along with them. it was definitely an ice breaker. i was now the center of attention and everyone was asking me questions. the rest of the night consisted of great food, good music, and the constant teasing of my new trend. it was great...i'm happy everyone had a good laugh even at my expense. for sure they will never forget me.   anyways, word has already gotten around about the incident so i wanted you all to be the first to hear it from me before you hear it on the street. damn..i room full of strangers..what a great way to make a first impression. :)

      ok..so i got this fish tank for valentine's day and i really wanted to have a pet shark but instead a got a bunch of feeder fishes. for some reason, they all got sick but one. the runt out of the group survived. she outlived all her brothers and sisters. then one day, i got a few guppies added to my tank but that didn't last long because they miracuously disappeared while i was on vacation. so now all i have is one guppy and a gold fish name wanda. i ran out of food a week ago...i've been neglecting them. i never really got to attached to the guppy but wanda, i did care about and i didn't want her to die. well, i was at my parent's house the other day and i saw my sister's turtle and thought about wanda. i asked my sis if i could have some of her turtle food for my fishy. yes i am lazy and didn't feel like going to the pet store. well when i got home, i crushed the turtle stick food and put one in the tank. wanda was so excited cuz she hasn't seen food in awhile. she went in for the food and she choked. the stick was too big for her little mouth. she was gagging. i didn't know what to do. i was so scared for her. i could see the food in her mouth. it was too hard for her to swallow it. a tear came to my eye...i felt my fish slipping away from me and if she died, it would have been all my fault. i called my friend and told him that my fish was choking. he was no help. he just laughed at me. so i hung up the phone and prayed that the food stick would just get soft so she could either swallow it or cough it up. after about 5 minutes of gagging, she coughed up the food. i was so relieved but then i saw her going for the food again but luckily it was soft enough for her to swallow. go figure.   well that's my fish story. i hope i never have to live through that again. it was pretty traumatizing. but i did learn something...that maybe i shouldn't get a shark ..and not to feed wanda turtle food. :-)

      I'm so tired of being here  Suppressed by all my childish fears  And if you have to leave  I wish that you would just leave  'Cause your presence still lingers here  And it won't leave me alone   These wounds won't seem to heal  This pain is just too real  There's just too much that time cannot erase   When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears  When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears  I held your hand through all of these years  But you still have   All of me   You used to captivate me  By your resonating light  Now I'm bound by the life you left behind  Your face it haunts  My once pleasant dreams  Your voice it chased away  All the sanity in me   These wounds won't seem to heal  This pain is just too real  There's just too much that time cannot erase   When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears  When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears  I held your hand through all of these years  But you still have   All of me   I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone  And though your still with me  I've been alone all along   When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears  When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears  I held your hand through all of these years  But you still have   All of me.....

      so yesterday morning i was awaken by the light shining through my window. it was&nbsp;the crack of dawn.&nbsp;since i was up, i decided to go to work early (disgusting huh?).&nbsp; so i get ready and head out singing along to a mix cd...and might i add it is the best mix cd i've ever received (thanks j).&nbsp; so i'm on the freeway trying to get on the 94 when all of a sudden i hear this loud rumble. i wasn't sure what it was but i looked around to see if they were doing some sort of construction on the freeway. i kept driving and the rumble became more intense...the noise&nbsp;was following me. "oh crap...i think it's my car!" so i pull over to the side of the freeway and i smell&nbsp;something burning.&nbsp; i get out and&nbsp;notice that my front tire is flat and the rims are&nbsp;bent. WTF!!&nbsp; so i sit back in my car and&nbsp;cry like a baby...ok....jk, i didn't do that but trust me, i wanted to.&nbsp;&nbsp;what really happened was that i changed out my own&nbsp;flat!!!!!&nbsp; lol...ok..that didn't happen either.&nbsp;instead i&nbsp;got out my cell and started scrolling down my numbers and the first person that i thought of, i couldn't call. the second person, i knew would do it but probably think i like him or something, and then your name came up....ahhh yes..my buddy jay to the rescue! so i call jay and he comes and saves the day, changes out my flat and of course i'm watching him do it just so i can do it myself next time.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; i'm very thankful that he was up that early and took the time to help me. thanks jay!&nbsp; well my first flat tire and i hope it's my last cuz who knows... next time i might not be so lucky...in other words...i might not get a hold of anyone. lol....

      every now and then i found myself back to where no one can hurt me.&nbsp; and although my mind is cluttered with what if's, should'ves, could'ves and would'ves, this place clears my thoughts but only for as long as i'm on the run. i've always enjoyed the outdoors especially the lakes, the beaches, the cliffs, and the mountains. some of my favorite&nbsp;solo spots, i've&nbsp; never had the chance or taken the time to share it with anyone. in away that's good because lately i've been hanging out there an awful lot but to have memories there with someone you love as well, would only defeat the purpose of my solo spot. a place to&nbsp;clear my mind and feel at peace with myself.&nbsp; &nbsp; it's been awhile since i've&nbsp;put on my running shoes&nbsp;to&nbsp;get away from it all but for the&nbsp;past couple months..that's all i've been doing...running.&nbsp;&nbsp;i guess it's the forrest gump in me. i don't ever want to stop.&nbsp; i want&nbsp;to keep on running until my mind is free and&nbsp;my heart is&nbsp;whole again.&nbsp; today i ran 6 miles and i think i sprained my ankle.&nbsp; my knees are getting weak. they're not as strong as they use to be. but&nbsp;that doesn't stop me...my run turns into a jog, then a walk, and ultimately&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;limp...i don't care...whatever it takes to&nbsp; keep going. i start to feel the pain even more. it hurts. &nbsp;at one point, i'm stopped by a roller blader. i'm not sure if he was hitting on me or actually wondering if i was ok but it doesn't phase me...i kept going.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; i'm not sure how much longer i can do this. my body&nbsp;says to stop, my mind says to keep going, and&nbsp;my heart calls out your name.&nbsp;i dunno...i&nbsp; guess i conflict with myself but what i do know is that&nbsp;i'm definitely running on empty....

      1 Corinthians 13:4-8 "Love is patient, love is kind. It is not jealous, it is not pompus, it is not inflated, it is not rude, it does not seek its own interests, it is not quick tempered, it does not brood over injury, it does not rejoice over wrongdoing but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails." &nbsp; &nbsp;

      there's so much i want to say and so much i can't say. so i'm leaving it up to fate with a little help from me. i do believe that events in our lives are predetermined but it doesn't mean it can't be changed. As long as you are in control of your life, you have the power to change your fate. With that said, i'm hoping that by making this decision to post this blog, my fate will be in favor of my destiny.  so here it goes...  our 100th day together brought us to a place where nothing matters. the focus was not on the world but on us. feelings were carefully thought out and written on paper. i can still remember how nervous i was and how excited i was to hear your letter. as your words flowed freely from your lips, i held on to every word that you said and kept 'em near to my heart. i was simply amazed. and then it was my turn. my voiced trembled as i read my letter to you. i couldn't focus on my letter because your words were still lingering in my mind. i couldn't breath so i paused and with your gentle caring touch, i was able to continue. at the end, i think we both knew we had something special, something worth every strength to hold on to and that's why it's so hard to let go.  if fate is on my side, you will find yourself back to my blog and read this entry. on august 13, 2004, 7:30 pm, i will be sitting at the place were we exchanged our letters. i am also hoping that fate will bring you to that same place. i will wait there for you and if you show up within the hour, i will believe that fate brought you back to me for a reason. and if the only reason is to talk about what happened or to get closure for the both of us then so be it.   there are so many unknowns right now and i know the only person that can get hurt by this is me. i have no idea if you still read my blog and there's a pretty good chance that you don't. i have no idea how you feel about me or if you even think about me anymore. i have no idea if you are working that night or have other plans. but what i do know is that my pride has gotten the best of me and i'm done with being stubborn. i want to do this...it's something i have to do and if you don't show up, i will know that my destiny is not you.  i've always believed communication is vital. it has definitely been lacking between us for the past few months. so now i'm leaving it up to fate. it's a chance i'm willing to take. i'm not hoping for a good outcome or expecting a bad one. all i'm wishing is that i will come to accept that this is the way it was suppose to be or not be and with that realization, i'll be able to move on and that's all i can do.
