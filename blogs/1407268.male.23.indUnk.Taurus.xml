       Prepare to lose cabin pressure.....    Welcome to Hell!  I'll be your tour guide in this delectable paradise, where the current temperature is a steamy zero degrees.  That's right folks, Hell has officially frozen over.  Now if you'll just follow me this way you can see our new flying pigs exhibit - oh, and don't mind the big red guy.  Satan decided to help out and start giving everyone sleighrides.....   That's right my loyal readers, life as you know it has ceased to exist.  Allow me to explain: Let me mention the name Karen - now I understand you've never heard this name before.  She is my most recent ex-girlfriend - the only one I ever lived with.  The short version, is that she went crazy - I mean  really  crazy.  She would scream at me and criticize me and make outrageous claims about me.  So I moved out, and for about my last week there, we didn't really talk.  We didn't say goodbye.  I didn't even care if I talked to her again - ever.  For anyone that knows me, this is a big deal.  Then last night on instant messager the tables turned.....   K:  Are you there?  Me:  I could be  K:  You hate me?  Me:  Hate is a strong word.  K:  Well, it's taken me a while to realize how stupid this has all been.   I'm sorry.   Houston, we have just lost cabin pressure. I mean what do you say to that, to someone who you feel has treated you like shit, who you previously described using words like heinous, incorrigible, and malicious?  I acted cordially, but it was disturbing, because she was actually being nice.  I don't know what to think - I only know this:  it's not over yet.

      Time to rant..... Why is everyone so pissed off?  I have done nothing wrong.  MK - If you want to treat me horribly, insult me to my face, and not even apologize or admit that you've done anything wrong, what right could you POSSIBLY have that would make me have to treat you with respect in return?  This is the part I don't understand.  If you want to be my friend, act like one first - otherwise, I have no reason to really want to be your friend anyway.....  Rachel - Don't even get me started.  You have no right to resent me - we are not together because of your choice as much as because of mine at this point, so don't turn on me just because you're not happy about it.  Your jealousy is not my fault, your unhappiness is not my fault.  Enough negative.  I have had an outstanding weekend, and it is mostly due to one person.  Agreed, the parking lot of Jay's Diner is hardly the most romantic of places, but there is never a perfect time, or a perfect place, and never at the right time.  Emily is someone that I can truly talk to and truly open up.  I love looking into her eyes and seeing everything that she wants to say in them - and I hear every word she doesn't say.  She is beautiful, both on the inside, and whether she'll believe me or not, on the outside - and it's genuine.  But the dilemma still persists and it feels much like Dagny's accidental crash into Atlantis:  knowing everything that I do, am I ready to make such a committment?  And this isn't just your typical male-anti-committment-syndrome, there would be serious complications.  Aside from being in 2 different locations geographically, she'll be in Maine for 10 weeks of the summer, and I don't know that I'll be able to get there to visit.  What do I do?  I'm so torn.....  Why does it always happen like this?  She's amazing, and she brings out such good things in me, why is she so far away?  Why is it so hard?  "And maybe knowing isn't the answer." ~Chuck Palahniuk

      John Galt said that he was going to stop the motor of the world - I can't imagine the amount of strength something of that magnitude would require.  At the same time I feel like I have that much strength within me - that no matter what happens I will always see the truth, that I will be able to remain uncorrupted by the ignoble and the malicious, the valueless and the virtueless.  Is it up to me to change the world?  And not just 'change the world' but actually  change  it?  Is the extremity of Atlas Shrugged or of Sodom and Gomorrah exactly what this world needs to survive?  Is there really no hope left for the majority of the world?  Why in a world that is what we make of it are there so many who are not happy?  I will not pity you - it is your own fault, not mine; I refuse to accept the blame - I refuse to grant you pity.  If you choose to accept pain and fear and guilt in your life, then this is your choice - I will not accept it in mine.  This is why I smile - not because I do not understand what is going on, but because I do fully.  Emily makes me happy - I refuse to feel guilty for that.  When we talk there is always a smile on my face, and I refuse to supress it; I refuse to accept the comments of my so-called friends; I refuse to feel guilt in addition to my happiness.  Rachel does not make me happy - I also refuse to feel guilty for that.  It is not my responsibily to make her happy, it is her own, and I will no longer cater to that - I refuse.  If this is what makes me a bad person in her eyes, then so be it - I am better in my own and it is my life and no one else's.  "This is your life and it's ending one day at a time."  - Chuck Palahniuk I ask only this:  Are you going to make yourself happy today?

      I was home this weekend for Easter - this is what I came up with.....  The irony of it all amuses me:  the more I go to church, the less I believe in God.  I actually had to control myself to keep from bursting into hysterics - not because the words were so absurd - I've heard them all before - but because the people were, and I was the only one who understood it.  250 people, and I'm the only one that can think for myself? Imagine a room full of what claim to be rational, thinking people, who can  see  God, who believe that they are  called  by Him, who actually allocate time out of their supposedly over-busy lives of reality television and soccer practice to pay homage to a god that they've never looked upon with their own eyes, that they've never heard with their own ears, and that they've never touched with their own hands. Imagine these people who say they don't need to see, or to hear, or to touch, but only to  feel , with an unidentified cause and an indescribable effect, that their god is  with  them, and the ways in which He is  at work  in their lives, without knowing  why , or  to what purpose , other than because  He  has a plan, and whispers misinterpreted rumors from generations ago, the likes of which are not physcially possible by any means any rational, logical, thinking person has ever seen. Imagine these people so weak and so deluded that what they  feel  so strongly and so blindly cannot stand on its own, but instead requires the sancition of others who  feel  what they  feel , and who believe so vehemently but gather together because the only evidence for such a conviction is the assurance of the people next to them, even though every eye is frantically searching for some fraction of certainty or some notion of confidence. Faith, no it's not faith that I have a problem with.  I have faith - I have faith in people, and in the ability of them to use the mind they have.  Granted this faith is harder to maintain by the day, but for those few who have earned my respect, it is them in whom my faith rests.  My problem instead is with the idea of  blind  faith, and the idea that it is okay to believe so fully in something that you would give your life, without ever having seen, heard, touched, smelled, or tasted any evidence to support it.  The equivalent would be like a blind man worshipping the sun without ever feeling the warmth of its rays, only because every sighted man tells him that it gives light.  I don't mean to preach, and it seems I've run out of steam anyway, it's just that on weekends at home I feel like I am alone in the world - and I refuse to give in to ignorance; to stop trying.  My lifesaver this weekend, was James, my best friend.  It was only 2 hours at the Diner (THE place to hang out in B'ville - the only place) but it was the only time that weekend where my smile was one of enjoyment, rather than bitterness - enjoyment of the company of a rational mind, rather than the bitterness of the absence of any.  But as with all things, the weekend ended, and my most serene moment was upon me - driving back to Rochester down the thruway, sun setting in the distance, and Cody, my brother's Papillon/Chihuahua mix, curled up asleep in my lap.  I never grew up with a dog, so now I finally understand why people that own them are happier - undying love and affection.....

      So I decided to reflect a little on my day, and this is what I came up with:  I no longer feel terribly ill, I had excellent coffee with a sorely missed SarOtto =), I was a good Jew and went to Passover Seder (FYI, I am  not  Jewish), I played Intramural football and walked away with an impressive turf burn, and I spent four hours talking to the previously mentioned 'beautiful stranger' (see previous blog).  As if this were not enough, it's soon to be 6:30 in the morning, EST, and I'm off with good friends to see a brother off at the airport.  Yes, it has been a long day, but a fulfilling one, and I must say, these are the things that smiles are made of.  For me, this is what makes life worth living - sure, I could dwell on the heinous conduct of my ex, and her pride, yes  pride , in her malice that makes me cringe in terror for fear that she is type of person that inhabits the world, but I don't.  I prey on the hope that there are more people cast from a mold similar to my own, or rather that our presence will be greater felt, and that I will find more and more of these rational beings to fill my life with.  The competent, the logical, the thinking - these are the ones I seek.  If I can find these people, then perhaps, as it has been of late, my life will be one I can find contentment with.  So, Ayn Rand, I drink this drink of sleep-deprived drunkenness to you, and your infinite brilliance, and thank you for all you've done to change my life.....

      To blog, or not to blog - that is the question.  Okay, so I don't like Shakespeare, but it's good to feel my fingers across the landscape of the keyboard again, if only for the purpose of movement..... Am I the beautiful stranger?  The one you think about, speak about, write about, as your fingers dance in the twinkle of midnight?  Is it my face you hope for in the morning sun, or see in the clouds above?  And why - the forbidden question that only the strong can answer, and the strongest ask - why is it me that you want to see?  That my face is worthy of the space in a museum, plastered to the wall amidst the so-called beauty of the ages, is this it?  Is it the mystery, yes, the mystery, the power and intrigue of the unknown that electrifies your spine and makes you unable to sleep?  Perhaps it is because you are my beautiful stranger..... the mystery, the intrigue, the beauty and the hope.  Are you?  A stranger you remain until perhaps I meet you in a dream, a reverie of generations past, and let the mystery crystalize into amazing form.....  So I'm on crack tonight.  Take what you will, I'm going to bed.  Peace, love and oreos.....

      A thought - everyone always asks if I'm happy.  They always sound really concerned about it too - not concerned as in an 'I genuinely care' way, but concerned as in a 'you're not going to committ suicide, are you?' way.  I have to tell you, honestly - I am happy.  I've realized that I have people that I can trust, and that can trust me; I have people I can love, and that love me; I am bound to the curse of intelligence, and am slowing finding more dedicated to the cause; every day I learn something that I didn't know the day before, and realize something new from the experience of days passed; I am becoming more the person I want to be with each day, and leaving more of what I don't want behind.  Certainly, I'm not at my goal - if I were, I'd set a new one to conquer, but the enjoyment comes from the struggle of the challenge, and everyday is a challenge.  And I know that there are not many people that can say that.  So yes, everyone, I'm happy, and not in an 'I'm just saying this to placate you' way, but in a 'The challenge is difficult, but I know I am stronger and always will be, and that makes me smile' way.

      "If I told you what I'm really thinking,  You wouldn't listen for long,  Yeah, yeah, you'd ask me if I've been drinking,  No, no, I'd tell you you couldn't be more wrong."       ~Candid Daydream    Well, here's my chance - and you only have to listen as long as you want to.  My moment to spout all the inequities of the unjust and ignoble into the abyss of cyberspace has finally come - may I rise to the challenge.    The key events of today:  1.  I read a bit of fiction better than I've read in a long time.  Operation Tactful Evolution, by E. S. Sauter - don't try and look it up, it's not published..... yet.  But it's extremely insightful and brilliantly poetic, leading the reader through a beautiful dance down the yellow brick road of 'Tact'.  More to come.....    2.  I hung out with the ex today - the weird part was that she was actually pleasant.  It's so rare, I had almost forgotten what it was like.  The unfortunate part is that it's such a foreign emotion to her - unfortunate I suppose because it actually makes me forget what a vile and malicious human being she is.  Evil for evil's sake is nothing that I can admire, or condone.  But alas, I am plagued with a desperate sense of duty and genuine care because there was a time, one that I suppose will exist eternally, when I did care deeply and immensely, to the great dominion of love even.  I have to agree with Ayn Rand on this one, that the love I always held for her, as for anyone, will always exist, assuming that I did in fact love them, but it is not the eternal love that I 'yearn' for - that word sounds so Victorian..... I realize looking back, that I've only loved three girls, all my life.  With Lynn, it was my first, and I realize now that we weren't for each other, no matter the reason.  Rachel was, and I guess still is, a learning experience.  Karen, was everything I thought I wanted, and she turned out to be nothing that I did.  So now, who knows - to quote one of the greats "I'm as confused as you are."    So that's my rambling - take it for what you will. =)

       Appetite for Construction   It's 3am, and I should be tired - sometimes, I just can't quiet my head.  What is wrong with everyone?  Why has everyone been brainwashed to believe that thought, logic, virtue are things to be slighted?  I even catch myself doing it sometimes - 'Why should I speak properly?  I'm not better than these people.'  But maybe I am.  Maybe it's my proclivity towards proper speech and challenge and competency and ability and virtue that truly does make me better than others.  Is it wrong to expect from others not their faults, but their virtues - not their failures, but their victories - not their inadequacies, but the best of what's within them?  I feel the hatred brood within me.  Hatred towards my culture, towards my race, as though it were my own hand that were betraying me.  A culture that prides one's greatest abilities, but abases and demoralizes those the exemplify them.  A culture of members who only want to strive for as little as they can, to exist until they can afford to give up, who accept mediocrity as a standard, as the normal progression of life.  Why?  The paradox is this:  the gross number of people that personify these characteristics that I loathe so voraciously actually contribute to the ease with which I could surpass the boundaries of mediocrity, however my mantra is one based not on a life of ease, but on one of challenge and excellence.  A victory over such an unworthy enemy would hardly satisfy.  So for now it comes to this - I desire equals.  I desire those stronger, more intelligent, more advanced than myself to serve as a means to my own self improvement.  And perhaps my appetite will never be sated, but to degrade myself to mediocrity is debacle I will not accept.....

       As I Sit Typing.....   Tomorrow, Rachel leaves - not for good, but for awhile at least.  Why does this bother me?  I know I'll still see her, I'll still talk to her, I'll still know her.  But she won't be here.  Solely thinking about someone does not make them real (Unless you're John Nash).  But why her?  It was freshman year when we met.  Who have I known so well for the past 3-4 years?  James?  But he's not leaving.  Christina?  I disappeared out of her life shortly after I broke up with her.  Other than faces and names, she's the only person I can say I've  known  for the entirity of college.  I got thinking today about people who I've forgotten over the years, people who I thought I would think about everyday, and now, barely remember their faces.  Like Lindsay Felice - sure, it was only third grade, but then she moved away.  I think about her from time to time wondering 'what if'.  And I could ramble on about what ifs but the conclusion I would come to?  I can't change the past - only the future.  So to change the future, I realize that I will never see a portion of the people that are leaving - ever.  And I'm okay with that.  I find the people that I will, make sure I can get a hold of them, and focus on my life.  That will make me happy - because right now I don't know what I am, but happy isn't it.  I don't know if I can explain how I feel watching everyone else graduate and move on.  I think I'm too close to it.  After my description on what it was like to have a child, I was told I was really good at that sort of thing, but right now, the words are not within me; I cannot understand what it is that plagues me, only that it will be temporary like everything else.  What happens when people move away?  All you have is a name, some remnant of the past that they could have changed by now anyway.  How do you find them?  Can you live with not seeing them again.  Could I ramble any more disjointedly?  I shall stop - your boredom is not my intention.  On any note, I think I may have a job with Writers and Books, and I move in on June 1st.  I really can't wait for that to happen - it's starting to drive me crazy.  As if I wasn't there already.  I don't know - comment, tell me what to write about.  I'll do it.  =OP  Until next time.....

       A Lot To Catch Up On   Here goes:  1.  Home was home.  My mother was a little better than normal, but overall the experience was the same.  It was good as always to see Steve, and James, and for that matter even the Shadow =OP  We went to a party my first night there, and it was like something you see in teenie-bopper high school movies, with the tiki hut bar and heated pool.  It was surreal, but a good time nonetheless.  2.  Still nothing on the job scene, but I haven't been trying hard yet this week.  I keep saying tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow, but tomorrow I'm going out.  And my apartment is going to be very difficult - I can move my stuff into the garage there, but the girl whose room I'm moving into isn't leaving until the end of the month.  Anybody want a visitor for a week or so?  It's going to suck.  3.   The Handmaid's Tale  is excellent, but I haven't been leaving myself much time to read it.  But at this point, I would definitely recommend it.  4.  Senior week.  So far it's been fun, but I'm getting sick of explaining to everyone that I actually wasn't at school this past year.  And to the first friends of freshman year who don't talk to you anymore, f*** you too =OP  It's going to be tough - not a lot of people are leaving Rochester after they graduate, but a few major ones are.  Eh, that's life, right?  5.  Graduation is going to be one of the most interesting days of my entire life.  Rachel's parents are going to be here.  Marty and Laurie and Nathan are going to be here.  They're going to meet for the first time.  Rachel's threatening my life if I'm not there for it.  Enough said - awkwardness ensues.....  That's hopefully it for the time I haven't kept updated.  I haven't gotten to talk to Emily a lot, because I'm poor, and after nine it becomes senior night, and who wants to decipher a screaming voice out of a deafening background?  "There's always a place, but there's never a time." ~Candid.  And now for something completely different..... I think I finally found a date to Mike's wedding (June 14).  Seeing as anybody I would want to take will literally be in a different state, I wanted somebody I could have fun with, but there wouldn't be any emotional pressure.  So assuming her boyfriend doesn't mind, Christina, my friend from freshman year will be joining me.  For once, a girl that I can just chill with, because she's happily taken.  It seems that with any other girl in my life, there has to be some complication.  Emily, Rachel, Kristin, MK, anybody; this is why I feel I will never have my sanity.  But who needs it anyway, right?  For now, I'm gone crazy - leave a message after the beep.  "There were so many fewer questions when stars were still just the holes to heaven."      ~Jack Johnson  Beep.....

       Halfway There   I got the greatest apartment ever:  upper story of a house, close to everything (especially the bars), and the man that lives downstairs works for the High Falls Brewing Company, maker of fine beers like: Genesee, Genny Light, Honey Brown, 12 Horse and many other favorites.  He likes to bring it home with him and share it with his housemates.    =)    Also, people are dumb.  End blog.

       From Blogger to Bestseller   Why is it you cannot go into the library unless you're a student taking classes?  Is it that absurd that someone would be trying to better themself, their mind, without the obligatory prodding of a final exam staring them down?  I guess so..... in this world.  "Ignoring isn't the same as ignorance, you have to work at it." ~Margaret Atwood,  The Handmaid's Tale   I'm enjoying this book thoroughly so far, about 70 pages into it.   A Confederacy of Dunces  was okay I guess, but I needed a point, and he didn't give me one.  Emily and I got into a debate about this actually - does a book really need to have a message, a greater purpose than just telling a story?  I think yes, and my choice of favorite books certainly reflects that - Atlas Shrugged, Cat's Cradle.  What purpose does a book serve if it doesn't carry with it some higher purpose?  It is simply an escape from the reality that is all around us, a retreat from a world that everyone fears and despises.  That's how things are in this world, though, right?  "Life sucks." "Life's a bitch, and then you die." These have actually become acceptable phrases in our world.  Everyone is just trying to escape to a world other than the one right in front of them because it's easier.  And I'll ask the same question I've asked hundreds of times before - Why?  I know why, and that's why I refuse to accept in in my life.  That is why I will never say that 'life's a bitch', because it isn't - not for me it isn't.  And maybe ranting in a weblog isn't enough.  Then how do I tell everyone the truth, that life doesn't suck, that life isn't a bitch?  A book perhaps?  A novel?  Read by many, understood by some, taught by few, written by one.  This is my challenge, this is my crusade, this is my something to fight for.

       The hunt is on.....   This week's mission:  to land myself the ever-evasive  job .  This is the week; now is the time.  Determination, aggrivation, desperation:  they shall all come together to aide me in my quest of employment.  And I will not take no for an answer - even if it means taking prisoners.....  So, I had an interesting talk with ::Insert random friend here:: last night.  (The actual name is Beth, but this is her first appearance.  Everyone say hi Beth! "Hi Beth!")  Yeah, so I asked her about if she thought it was ever possible to actually get over someone, or if they just had to go really far away.  The idea we came up with:  resolve comes when you stop thinking about them.  Because that's all it really is in the end, you're holding them in your mind.  So does this mean that my ever-analyzing, over-thinking mind is doomed to perpetual emotional trauma?  Or is there a threshold that eventually I might reach and should aspire to?  Does anybody have the answer?   No   And I guess I'm okay with that.  My therapy?  Golf =)  I can clear my head, and suddenly everything regains perspective.  Other than that I'm just lost in thought as to what to write creatively - my mind always wanders too much.  So if anyone wants to share - tips, comments, ideas - I'd be happy to listen (wink, wink).  Anyway, on to that or a good book for the evening.....  A bientot!

       Gone Crazy.....   I cannot accurately describe to you what it feels like to bring life into this world.  I do not know that it is something that can be understood unless you have been there oneself.  How do you measure the value of a human life?  And who is fit to judge it's value?  I am convinced on this day that those who have taken life away from others, have never given life to this world; they have never made a life of their own.  Had they seen the mirror in which they had created, had they seen themselves with every movement, and heard themselves with every laugh, and with every cry, the idea of taking life away from another would perish.  As I said before, it is not something you can make someone else understand.  On that note, dinner with Laurie and Marty and Nathan was  amazing .  He is more beautiful and smarter than ever and is so pleasant and wonderful to be around - and I am reaffirmed every time that I see Marty and Laurie that we couldn't have made a better decision.  The first time we met them, we knew.  Rachel brought up an interesting point, too.  She said to me that somebody had asked her what she wanted right now, graduating and moving and having a lot on her mind.  She said:  I came to college to make a difference, to make somebody else's life better.  They told us that they had completed all their goals and they had only one thing left that they wanted to accomplish, and that was to have a child - and they couldn't.  We gave them that dream; we made their life complete.  What else could I want?"  Perhaps this is why I fell in love with her.....  I've been dealing a lot with Rachel, and I figured it would be easy because she'd be leaving, and I wouldn't see the good and could only think of the bad, but it's not going to be possible.  Nathan will be a constant reminder of the best of our relationship.  When he is around, we are both at our best.  Does that mean I should just forget about the bad?  Does the bond we made with Nathan abolish all the terrible things we've ever said or done to each other?  It hurts to think she's leaving soon, because I know I'll miss her when she's gone.  I want to cry, laugh, and scream all at the same time.     Cry because I miss Nathan, and because he reminds me of Rachel, and because I miss Rachel.  Cry because I never want to hurt anyone, but somehow I always end up doing it anyway.  Cry because he's beautiful, and as much as he's mine, and Rachel's - he's not.     Laugh because he's so beautiful and so smart and so pleasant and they're doing such a good job with him.  Laugh because I know that we made the best out of a situation that could have gone horribly wrong.  Laugh because even when we're at our worst, she can still make me smile, and I still care about her.     Scream because I can't keep my head straight because it's going in so many different directions.  Scream because I know that eventually the world is going to break me, and I'm going to give up - the one thing I don't want to do.  Scream because it's the only thing that makes any sense at all anymore.....

       Bad Dan - Now go sit in the corner.....   Forgive me blogger for I have sinned against you.  It has been 5 days since my last post.  Not a lot has happened in these past few days:  I turned 22.   As I said before, big, fat, hairy deal.  I'm not a big fan of birthdays, and so it's kind of fitting that this one was kind of 'eh'.  I did laundry(I know, I'm pathetic).  Thank you to everyone who wished me a happy birthday, and remember,  do not resist the birthday hug monkey.   I discovered jazz and classical.   A friend of mine introduced me to "The Philadelphia Experiment" and Emily introduced me to Faure.  They're really good.  I argued with Rachel.   Oh wait, this is supposed to be about what's NEW in my life..... oops.  I am reading "Confederacy of Dunces".   So far, so good.  I know, I'm being really boring right now - all I can think about is Nathan, my son.  That sounds so surreal - I have a son.  I'm going to see him and the parents, Laurie and Marty, for some form of evening activity.  I haven't seen him since September - he's going to be huge.  I know, this post really isn't very good, I'm just a little preoccupied.  I promise I will post later with staggering brilliance to make up for it, and my abscence these past few days.  A bientot!

       To Win the War   Maybe I'm trying to hard - maybe I'm not trying hard enough.  Either way, the right words just won't come.  Maybe they're waiting for me, lying in wait to ambush me simultaneously and tackle me to the ground.  Maybe I'll struggle, throwing them in every direction, battling with every shred of vitality I have until I emerge victorious, all the words strewn to their proper place and the battle standing as a monument to the future.  That is what I'd like to think.  The truth is I don't know how it works - which is probably what bothers me most.  So I keep trying, not only to figure it out, but to accomplish it, with each word a bullet, each sentence a battle, and each chapter a war.  Proverbially speaking.  Maybe tomorrow I'll write - maybe the words will just flow.  Maybe I'll struggle for hours and make it a paragraph further than I was.  But maybe that's how it's supposed to be to do it right; the only way to know is to do it.

       The End of a Streak   I wrote today.  Not a huge accomplishment, but significant, as I hadn't for many days now.  I'm not overjoyed - what I wrote was terrible.  My style was completely lacking, and my train of thought derailed about every third word, but for now, it is an improvement.  Today a paragraph, tomorrow a novel, next week the world.  Also this week marks the end of my unemployment - I'm about 95% sure I have a job.  Starting July 7th, I should be selling AT&T wireless service to businesses around the country for $10/hr. plus commissions.  The beauty of this position is that not only will I be receiving paid holidays, full benefits and sitting in a cushy chair all day, but I will deal solely with inbound calls.  This makes me a very happy Dan.  Life is getting back on track.  For a while, I didn't know what I was doing or what I wanted.  Not to say that I do completely now - but I have a better idea.  Hell, I can't even figure out what to do about Rachel, but I guess right now I don't have to.  As Andrea told me, I  do  have more important things to worry about and a girl  would  only make things worse.  So for now, I may not know how to get where I want to go, but at least I am learning more about what I want out of the life that I've been given.  Though the hard part still lies ahead of me, I am more confident than ever that I will emerge victorious on the other side.  I am going to see Candid Daydream Friday night - I am excited :)  "Keep your head above the water and don't let it get to you I know that's easy to say and much harder to do But if you let your hate consume you it will only bring you down  If there's one thing I could tell you my friend don't dwell and drown"  - Brandon Henderson

       Writer's Block   I don't believe in writer's block.  Even now, having not written in days and having no sight in end - I don't believe in it.  I think it's a condition of the writer that prevents him from exploring the world on paper.  In my case, it's poverty.  My lack of money is making me upset, and it's not getting any better.  I have an interview monday - hopefully that will change the tides.  Until then.....  "I don't feel anymore - I could laugh, but man what for?" -Candid Daydream

       Why Me?   My friend Tony from home tonight wanted to know if I thought he was a bad person.  He wanted  my  opinion.  But why me?  My friend Kristin decides to tell me that even though we haven't talked in years, she still thinks about me all the time, and misses me.  She's scared to call my phone to talk to m.  And not to be narcissistic, but she isn't the first girl that I've had this effect on.  Why me?  Then there's my job situation - I try really hard for a job that I really want, and they barely even shrug at me and don't return my phone calls.  Then, I go to fill out an application for a job I really don't want, and he practically throws it in my lap.  'I'll give you a call next week.'  Why me?  Suffice to say, I'm not happy with life right now.  Depressed?  Certainly not - I have the rousing evenings of Stratego (I won) and jigsaw puzzling La Casa Lynn (Amy's House) to keep my spirits aloft.  But something is definitely missing - I've lost my passion.  Even after finishing  Atlas Shrugged  for the second time (which I am even more convinced is the greatest novel ever written) I felt uninspired and empty.  I think the burdens of the world have begun to weigh too heavily upon my shoulders.  I don't know that this was the world I was meant to inhabit - I often feel like I don't fit with it - that I am meant for something different.  As much as I love computers, I think I was born in the wrong generation.  As a writer, I identify more with Fitzgerald and Hemingway and Ford than I do with Morrison or Grisham or Sparks.  Their language, their ideas, their customs - that is my spirit.  But what am I to do, a traveler in a strange land?  I need to shrug.  Maybe then the world will begin to make sense.  Why me?  Because I  am  different; because I am not like everybody else; because of everything I stand for, and everything I am and will ever become.  And now, I leave you with words which need to be immortalized:       emilystarrunner:  thank God for vicodin.

       The Internet Strikes Back   Tomorrow I get the internet back.  I feel I've been without one of my best friends - but I guess that's a bit extreme.  Anyway, the return of the internet, and the blog, tomorrow.  Same blog time, same blog station.....

       Out of My Cage   Beware America, the ultimate corporate 'yes-man' has arrived.  This monday, yes tomorrow, in just a few short hours, I will be unleashed to the businesses of this great country in a fiscal fiasco that will resonate through the millenia..... or maybe I'm getting a little carried away.  Either way, it is official - training is over and I begin official sales.  I even get my own cube.  Is it wrong that that's all it takes to make me happy?  Hehehe  Life is good - I think I finally have an idea worth expounding into the elaboration of a novel.  I'm writing again, and life is just plain good.  I suppose that's all for now, but a message to everyone..... Come visit me!!!  Peace out, people.

       When You Say Nothing At All.....   Many people have called it my sixth sense, including me.  And no, I can't see dead people.  I'm referring to my uncanny ability to get inside people's heads; and it's not it what they say so much, as in what they don't say.  The words may say one thing, but to me, there's more than just the words and the thoughts that accompany them - it's the words that weren't said, the thoughts that had to be censored by not using certain words, speaking in certain ways.  I don't think I could ever explain it - it's just something that I understand, and it makes me enjoy being me.  I love it - I get this huge grin when I'm making people tell me things I already know to see if they'll actually tell me.  "Squirm" isn't the right word, but it's the first one that comes to mind.  It's not like I'm 'using my powers for evil' or anything like that.  In fact I think it helps people get over certain inhibitions they might have in opening up to me.  Thinking back, I don't think I've ever had anyone that I couldn't convince to trust me - ever.  I don't know where I'm going with this, I just really enjoyed it through a conversation I had today (sorry Bree!) and thought I should share - I hadn't shared in a while.  I like kindergarten.  Sharing is fun.  NO!  It's mine!  I'm officially off the drugs now.  Ponder this - I'm out for now.

       You Say You Want A Revolution.....   Sometimes it seems like that's the only way.  Ayn Rand is right - there are too few people out there that are actually worthwhile, and most of the ones that are have lost the hope that I continue to further in my own existance.  Hope that the people of this world won't always be as ignorant as they have been; hope that I can actually change the world; hope that I will find someone that will fulfill every quality I look for in a mate; hope that I'll wake up one day in a world where the close-minded and ill-conceived exist no longer; hope for just a few little things to make life better.  Am I just placating myself?  Last night I sat in a room of six freshmen, the future of our nation.   One  of them could actually interact with me on an intelligent level.  One out of six; it wouldn't pass a New York State Regents, and my standards are significantly higher.  So what to do?  Let's rally the troops and dig in the trenches, we've got a war to fight.  Sure the odds are against us, but in the words of another 'Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds.'  I've got a life to live, and I won't do it any other way.

       As You Wish   I finally broke down and watched it tonight, and I must say I was pleased.  One line kept resonating through my mind though, like a drop in water:  "She never called him Wesley..... 'Oh farm boy!' "  She never calls me Dan.  To her, I am, and will eternally be, 'Dan Boy'.  Have I always been this oblivious?  Or just unenlightened?  Does it really matter anymore?  This wave has risen again, and, though I know she will never read this, the water may rise and crash to sea again, but the amount of water in the sea does not change.  Whatever you ask, whatever you say, 'as you wish' and 143.  "And If I had the answers would it make any difference, We’d go on living the way we always have"

       Insert U2 Song Here   I'm back!  I know I haven't blogged in awhile - I felt I had been lacking the inspiration.  That is until yesterday:      It was a chilly august day (Welcome to Syracuse) and I had been invited to attend a wedding with a friend of mine.  Naturally, this made my mind wander like a camel on a bad day.  All my introspections and reflections and insights and outsights and in-betweensights led me to one universal and irrefutable conclusion:  my life right now is devoid of love; I am devoid of passion.  Sure, I have my writing and my reading and my guitar, but this is something different.  I saw couples kissing like they meant it, not just to kiss; I saw couples dancing like they meant it, not just to dance; I saw a couple pledge the rest of their lives to each other because they were so in love with one another, not just to get married.  I've entertained the thought that this is just my mind trying to get over Rachel, but then why would I miss her more now?  Or maybe I just miss more what I had with her, but then why can't I picture it with someone else?  Maybe that's just the way it works, I couldn't say for sure.  Most the time, I just can't make up my mind.  But either way,  I still haven't found what I'm looking for , anyway.

       Hermitic Advantages   I don't care what anyone says, I'm moving to a cabin, alone, with a lake and lots of books, both filled and unfilled.  I will live my life from novel to novel, writing and reading, in the peace and quiet of solitude and nature.  It just seems easier to me this way, both for me and for everyone else.  Now, you're probably wondering what brought this about.  Simply, it was a conversation with a friend of mine, the one who actually has known me longest.  And it wasn't so much the conversation, but the fact that when she told me 'girls that date you are stupid', I couldn't find an argument to refute her.  I still can't - she's right.  Anyone that wants to date me has got to have something wrong with their head - nothing personal, but that's just how it seems to me, and apparently I'm not alone.  So just call me Emerson.  I'll be 'chillin' on Walden pond, sipping Yeungling, and pondering the simplicty of the universe.  I guess I never knew what hit me I know it doesn't matter now I'm sure the only thing important Is the way we play things out  - Candid

       Realizations of a B-ville Weekend   #1:  I should start going to church.  Never do I find myself more inspired to write, or more creatively influenced than when I am in a house of God.  I don't know what causes it, whether it's the unintentional ingoring of the service, the multitude of blind followers, or just the singing, feel-good atmosphere, but I am never without vision at church. #2:  I don't want/can't handle/shouldn't have a girlfriend.  After a weekend of overwhelming 5th wheel experiences, in the company of Steve and Kat, and James and Tric, and Adam and Bec, I've realized that what they lack in themselves they have to find in someone else; this is not a problem I have.  If I feel I lack something, I change myself, I don't get someone else to fill the void. #3:  I know I just saw her last weekend, but it was really good to see Emily.  She may call herself a 'factory model' of where she comes from, but she's something new to me and she intrigues me; she amuses me, as much as it frustrates her. #4:  I really am a simple creature.  Other people for me provide an infinite amount of entertainment - even those I think I completely understand already.  So this one goes out to a very old friend:  Liz, my life is simple :) #5:  I have two major dreams in life, and I need to make them happen.  One is to write a novel and get it published, two is to play in a band and perform.  I'm good enough for either, and strong enough for both, I just need to get started.  I think that's it - the diner hasn't changed much, and to be honest, neither have the people.  I don't know why everybody's so afraid of change - it's what I live for, it's what I base my life on, at least until I reach perfection.

       'The Answer'   I wish I posted more often.  I just feel like every time I do, something profound or monumental should have happened to warrant it.  Now that something has, I am speechless.  My words seem superfluous; my thoughts are scattered and indecisive. The right way always seems just a GRE word away, or a Joyce-esque enigma further.  Nonetheless, the profundity is upon me:   I wrote a song.   But more than that, I wrote a song that  I  like.  After six years of grueling practice, of late nights and disgruntled neighbors, of caloused fingers and broken picks, I wrote a song that puts a smile on my face when I play it and realize that it is my own, that I created it.  The feeling is immeasurable.  Everyone has something that they want, that they've wanted for a long time.  This is the feeling after all the pain - physical, emotional, psychological - after the effort, the practice, the precision, the turmoil, the frustration, the misunderstanding, the hopelessness.  I'm past that for now; this is the payoff.  This is the accomplishment and the reward.  This is the enjoyment.

       What Do You Want?   This, I suppose, has been the theme of my weekend.  The world is basically at my fingertips, in every manner of speaking, and I just can't figure out what to do with it.  First she asked me at about 3 o'clock in the morning last night.  I told her I wanted a lot of money.  She asked me again today and I didn't have a new answer for her, but I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.  What do I want?  The problem is that I don't know, and it's caused a lot of other problems.    But I do know some things I want.  I want to write.  I want a laptop so I can leave work and go to a coffee shop and caffinate myself and do what I love.  I want a car.  I want the freedom to be able to leave at any moment, even if I don't.  I want Boston.  I want a city on water with people everywhere and a beautiful view.  I want to make things happen.  I want to own something, whether it be a copyright or a company, or maybe even both.  I want love.  I want romance.  I want the side of me that wants those things back.  I want to travel.  I want to be over her - and her.  I want a lot, and I will not settle for less.  But none of this does me any good now.  Right now I'm just trying to get there - but how?  Hell, if I had the answer, I wouldn't have these problems.....

       Sleep Deprivation and Split Screen Sadness   It's dark and though she stares at him from inches away, the distance seem infinite.  Surely the journey shouldn't be so taxing, but often looks can be deceiving, and even they are not exempt from this universal epithet.  The difficulty came instead from what they both knew to be a battle, raging in her mind.  They both knew what it meant, and it meant a lot more than either of them could know.     'You're waiting for something' she said; he acquiesced.    'This isn't my decision to make.'  She sighed and resigned to the pillow.  'I've made up my mind already,' he continued.  'Now it's up to you.'    'But I don't want that power.  Why can't you just decide for me?' but even as she said it, she knew he couldn't.  She would have to decide this one for herself, and as she cogitated the two sides, the complexity only grew worse.  One resolution seemed evident however:  to walk away unscathed meant to walk away without knowing happiness in this moment.  Perhaps the scar would worsen, but moments like this had a rarity to them that was both precious and pernicious.  One moment of happiness is worth the arduousness of resulting misery.    'What the hell...'  The next morning came too early, and the boy was sad to leave.  He knew that no words he used could describe accurately what he was thinking, so he tried to use as few as possible.  Everything was superfluous; he left a kiss upon her forehead and walked away.    He knew his thoughts would be with her and was saddened to acknowledge that it could be only his thoughts.  Life is like that sometimes though, and when making lemonade out of life's lemons wasn't good enough, what else did he have but his memories?  And it stings when it's nobody's fault Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name It's only the air you took and the breath you left  - John Mayer

       Repetition for Emphasis   It happened again.  I could say it was the alcohol, but that's probably not it - I knew what I was doing.  My problem:  I'm too curious - and for a dog person, I'm running low on lives.  So I suppose the question is, 'why?'.  Why do I always find the need to sate these ephemeral impulses?  Do I lack self control or is my curiousity, my overwhelming desire to know just too important?  I have always claimed that the goal of my life is to understand, but does that rationalize this repeated erring on my part?  I was terrified and knew better even before anything happened, but I proceeded anyway.  If I  were  a cat, I would surely be dead by now.  I know I've been enigmatic, and I apologize, but some things are not for all eyes to see.  For now it is enough to say that I am am human and I do make mistakes.  Eventually I will perhaps defeat this tragic flaw, but until then, the more mistakes, the merrier.

       We Didn't Start the Fire.....   My job sucks.  I hate it - if I could find the money elsewhere I would, but I can't.  I am started to understand why people go postal - this is not the life for me.  I need to finish school, but to do that I need money.  This is the suffering that's going to come before my reward.  Maybe I should just write a novel, and use the royalties to go back to school.  Who knows.  I think my biggest problem with my job is what I've learned about humanity, and not just the people that call up, but the employees as well.  I've lost almost all faith in humanity - I do say almost because I know there are worthwhile people out there, but they are not as prominent as they should be.  And it's only going to get worse.  See, the problem with the world right now is that the people that should be procreating aren't, and the people that shouldn't be are.  Perhaps this is God's (if he does exist) plan for armageddon, perpetuating the intelligent with a sublime terror of fornication and procreation, for fear of either their lives, or those of their unborn children, and undulating into the population more and more ignorance and disease until the logical and rational have no place and the human condition is asphyxiated by it's own malnutrition.

       Let's Eat   Life has been moving very quickly lately; my room is a mess, my free time evaporates like a boiling pot and I feel like I can never get anything accomplished.  So I've decided I'm going to stop wasting time - the internet is my vice, and I'm going to control it.  I'm cutting back to 1 pack a day, so to speak.  I just have too much I need to get done, and done now, to waste time interneting.  I need to write, I need to read, I need to get a second job, I need to start using my phone and stop using my keyboard, I need to do laundry, I need to clean, I need to get groceries, I need to make a budget, I need to tell the cop to stop calling me, I need to play more music.  I need to do a lot of things - the world is my cheeseburger and I'm friggin' hungry.  Let's Eat.  Song:  Everything I Know, by Candid Book:  House of Leaves, by Mark Z. Danielewski

       Three Cheers for Two Words   It seems I myself have some two words of my own to be handed out.  (For those of you at home not familiar with the show, the 'two words' I refer to are the Americanism, ' Fuck You '.)  First we'll start with the most frustrating - the unintelligent.  These people are everywhere - the most frustrating tonight however, was the wolf in sheep's clothing.  This is someone who, though never an equal, at one point I considered rational, logical, capable of intelligent thought; tonight she has proven me wrong.  I think what bothers me most is her inability to observe what's going on around her; observation is the key to understanding, to knowledge, to truth.  I suppose next are the ignorant - and there is a difference.  I'm referring, I suppose rather specifically to those that assume the worst of the delusions in their heads, that have disregarded other people's sacrifices for none of their own.  Maybe I'm being selfish - it happens, but I don't like situations like this.  Unfortunately, I think that's all, though equally unfortunate, I'm afraid this covers an implorable amount of the people I know.  So this is for the few specifics, as well as the generals.....

       The World is Our Cheeseburger   Lately I've been reading Mark Danielewski's  House of Leaves , which aside from it's superb writing and creepily interesting subject matter actually gives me something else.  It gives me freedom - reading something like this makes me realize exactly what is possible.  The reader will believe anything you show them, you just have to construct the world you make correctly.  And this is what I'm realizing - the world is my cheeseburger.  (It's more American than an oyster - I've never even had oysters.)  So needless to say, I've been writing, and basically working my life back into order.  Life isn't always going to be good, but it's life nonetheless, and we have nothing to do with it but live or die.  'Get busy livin', or get busy dyin'.'  I love Shawshank Redemption.  "Hope is a good thing, maybe even the best of things, and no good thing ever dies."

       Layin' Down the Law   Enough of this - I've decided it's been too long since anything has been fabricated from the imagination of yours truly.  It's gone on too long - tonight it ends, armed only with my dashing wits and some leftover Michelob Ultra (the sporty beer..... bleh!) I intend to conquer the demon they call writer's block, to demolish this lack of inspiration.  Enough rant, time to work.  If anything becomes of it, I'll let you know.  P.S. Nobody comments.  Please, just comment so I continue to indulge my nacissitic diatribes.  Please? P.P.S. Two more days until pay day.

       Don't Let the Man Get You Down.....   I feel like there are two sides of my life:  the happy side, and the unhappy side.  I'm happy because I'm doing a lot and I have good friends and good times and I'm on my way to getting my world the way I want.  I'm unhappy however, because everything is not how I want, and most of the time I feel like it never will be, and the way I'm getting there right now, or at least trying to, isn't the way I want.  I don't enjoy my job - sure, maybe it would be better if I actually made commission and this place didn't suck horribly as far as that's concerned, but it does.  C'est la vie.  I'm finding a new job.  I'm tempted to take the bartending class and start mixing drinks.  That would make me happy, only problem is I have no ride, which is always what my problem is.  Ugh.  Bleh.  Blah.  It's Monday, the only thing keeping me going is that it's a pay week.

       Look Out Harvard, Here I Come   Tonight I walked into my apartment, black shoes, square toes, gray cargos, blue sweater, messanger bag thrown over my shoulder, ambling with a rare gaiety.  As I set down my bag and relaxed I realized that it was a part of what I want.  I want to come home every night, well dressed and having accomplished what I enjoy in my day:  reading, writing, and teaching.  I want to be a college professor, but more than that, I want to be  the  college professor.  The one that hangs out with his students at the coffeeshops, the one that teaches not only the material, but teaches about life, the universe, anything - everything, but most importantly the one that sits on top of the desk, not behind it.  I don't know why, but I sense that embodies it best.  And I don't know what I have to do to get there, but it'll be worth it to get there, just like the line for the roller coaster.  Next time:  The syllabus for my first course, 'The Books You Should Have Read'.

       A Dull Normal   Well, after a mental health day Monday, my week is going much better.  I started writing one of my stories (almost 900 words already).  Work still sucks, but it's tolerable at least until payday.  Life is back to the dull normal that I'm used to - not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad one.  Either way, it's life and it keeps moving.  Make money, get a car, get back to school, get out of debt, etc.  Word  Book: Wonder Boys, by Michael Chabon - so much better than the movie.

       Entirely Uninspired   It's Sunday - I have to go to work tomorrow, I've done nothing all day, and I can't seem to shake some intangible, immutable, unnamed fear.  It's just something that's been infecting me, like a disease of overanalyzation and dramatization.  I can't unlove.  There's only one person I ever truly loved and lost, and it took me almost a year to get over her, and all we did was kiss a few times.  Perhaps hope is my problem - I just have too much of it, if there is such a thing.  If there exists any possibility within the realm of reality I nurture it, I encourage it and maybe this is the problem.  Maybe all it takes is time.  Maybe it takes distance.  Maybe it just takes something I don't have, or can't do.  Any help here would be appreciated - I just can't seem to figure this one out.....  Rachel, Kristin, Amanda, Caitlin, Allison..... these names echo in my mind as lost opportunities and future hopes, and I can't dismiss them.  I have no control here, and I'm out of control.

       Fuck This World, It Doesn't Deserve Me   Today I'm angry.  I'm angry at AT&T for being the most asinine company I've ever worked for and thriving in spite of it.  I'm angry at anyone that I speak to that doesn't use their brain.  I'm angry at a lot today and a lot of it stems from one thing: I expect the best of other people.  So how am I different from everyone else in this world screaming about what they deserve, what they're entitled to, why everyone else should provide their best?  Sometimes, I guess I just feel like the only one demanding the same of myself.  I'm the only one that says I want your best but in exchange for the best I can offer.  These people scream for your best while exemplifying their worst and still think they are entitled.  You can hear the same people saying that they love another's faults, their imperfections while I say I love you for your virtues, for your abilities, for your integrity.  Why should I be expected to grant my best, when it gets smothered by everyone else's worst?  To quote Ani, "I bet you can't even tell me that much".  Song:  Untouchable Face, by Ani DiFranco  P.S. I apologize for the disjointedness of this - I'm just really angry at people today.

       'We're All North and Dreamin's South.....'   Monday night was outstanding, even given the inherent exhaustion.  I have never seen people with more talent; Anthony was right: they are gods.  They're creative, passionate, talented, intelligent..... the list goes on.  They are living a life I've only dreamed of, and though 'hate' is the word that might leave my mouth, 'admire' is the word that lies between the lines.  Lately I've been very nostalgic.  I miss the people and the times I once knew, be it James, Rachel, Adam, Kristin, Steve, Tony..... that list goes on too.  I remember James and his crazy college friends and our late night trip to Taco Bell.  I remember Kristin's hugs, and the smell of her hair.  I remember lazy days lying in bed with Rachel, just playing with her hair.  I remember crazy car rides in the Beamer (it's not just an automobile), I remember a time when I had to ask "Is it my turn to drive home?"..... yet  another  list that goes on forever.  To quote Shawshank Redemption "I guess I just miss my friend(s)".  But I look at it this way:  at least I've been lucky enough to find friends to miss.

       The Twilight Zone Episode You Missed   I forgot to mention this - Anthony called me 'responsible' yesterday.  It was weird, but according to him, on the responsibility scale I'm comparable to his father.  Maybe he's warped, or maybe I have more going for me than previously thought.  Either way, it's a compliment I won't hear again anytime soon.  I've been branded, and in a way I don't mind.

       Bonny & Clyde   or   A Musician's Wet Dream   So Anthony came to visit today, and with a little help, he actually found the place.  We went to Hooters (Yay for redheads), drove around, got caught in the rain and pretty much just hung out.  Honestly, I think the world of that kid - even with all his..... shall we say "quirks".  Genuinely, he's a great person, and the more he realizes it himself, the more he's showing it.  And musically, don't even get me started - he's the Bonny to my Clyde.  If only I could play and write the way he does.  If only we were in the same f***ing zip code maybe we could do something about it, because I know we could.  And it would be good - very good.  Apprently he's picking me up and we're going to Syracuse tomorrow night.  Who knew?  Should be fun - good music and good company.  What more can one ask for?  Song: Iceberg, by Candid

       Too Good Not to Post   So I went a little crazy this weekend - and a desperate away message calling for a story of hippos seemed a perfect outlet..... Enjoy.  * * * * *  Alright, so, I don't know how you heard about this, but it all started with this guy named Calvin Stinger.  See, Calvin was going around telling people about how well I could wrestle.  Well, this was in my younger days, before the war in 'Nam and all.  I had been three years into a collegiate scholarship that was gonna boost me straight through to the Olympics and national stardom, blah blah blah.  Calvin was my roommate.  We were both a little strapped for cash, spending all the available money we had on the essentials - strippers and booze - so he called a guy who knew a guy who knew a friend of a friend of a guy and got us on the black market.  Now, it wasn't the money you see at cockfights or anything, but Calvin always knew I was a sure bet, and we always split it fifty/fifty.  So a few dozen champagne rooms later and Calvin and I both were getting a little tired with the monotony of our predicament - nothing was a challenge anymore.  So we aimed for higher mountains - that's when he suggested the alligator.  "The locals call him 'El Gato'. Say it's cause he moves with the swiftness of a cat. What’d’ya say?"  It was my Kiliminjaro, my pinnacle - I accepted with steadfast narcissism.  So 2 weeks later we were on a flight to small town Florida to wrestle bets, and a felinic amphibian - odds were two to one for the cat.  Well honestly, I was a little nervous, I mean, wrestling people, you know what they can do; an alligator could pull a fast one on me - fast.  Calvin assured me I'd be okay - if anything happened, he'd have my back, so to speak.  So the day after we touched down I was limbering up when they released 'El Gato'. I thought for sure that this animal had been misnamed - either that or the Floridian natives just didn't know the Spanish word for bear.  Then he moved, and I was certain he had claimed more than one of its previous contenders.  Limbering up became a bit more difficult at that point, but in a glance at the money in Calvin's hands, I knew that the show must go on.  Needless to say the fight was nearly over before it began.  Though I had managed to avoid any teeth marks marring my flesh, I was greatly overmatched in size and speed, and the alligator was well aware.  I thought for sure that my back was to be got by Calvin, but he remained at water's edge, grasping firmly to $50 bills and desperately seeking an excuse to be called away from the mayhem about to ensue.  And then it happened.  Everyone, so intent on my situation with the cat failed to notice the stealthy hippo moseying up from the side.  Sensing that I was both in trouble, and an emphatic enthusiast of animals, he rushed to my aide.  With a charging blow he sent 'El Gato' in the opposite direction just Hollywood moments before his bloodthirsty fangs tore into my able body.  Scared and bewildered at an African hippo in the Florida wetlands, everyone, including the alligator, fled the premises and we were alone - for the third time that day, I thought I was done for (bad breakfast incident).  "Lemme help you up" he said.  "I didn't know hippos could talk" I replied, stunned.  "It's a little known fact. We're actually rather articulate and relatively intelligent creatures, though nothing of genius caliber. Are you okay?"  "Thanks to you" I replied. "Can I buy you a cup of coffee?  "Absolutely - I'm parched"  We headed off to the local Starbucks and threw back a couple of Iced latte's before he had to leave to catch his flight back to Malawi.  And to this day, we still write.  As a matter of fact, I just got a Christmas card from him, though he's Buddhist.  It said 'Confucius said, "Don't use a cannon to kill a mosquito", but I say, if you're up against an alligator named Cat, don't forget your hippo. Happy Holidays.'  The End  * * * * *

       Tentatively:  Life, Love   * * * * *  Outside the outer exit the same sign has hung for fifty years, flickering through harsh winters, glimmering through warm summer nights; a beacon to many a distant traveler and far fewer local envoys.  The Pottsville Diner (P’ville for short) stood as a lavish monument to small town America, a microcosm of the conglomeration of thousands of other towns only different by name and high school benefactor, just beyond the throes of downtown’s one stoplight and corner bridal shop, where deep fry fumes could waft unnoticed into the night air, save for those select few who were contributing their own caustic emissions to the cause.  Inside, coffee always cost a dollar, whether Alice thought to refill it only once or a half dozen times, and though it couldn’t compare to a Starbucks caramel mochiato, there’s always enough sugar to transform any bitter into sweet, and your wallet can enjoy it to.  And there it had stood as long as any of them could remember, and in the same way, nightly, they joined its ranks, if only transiently, a bit out of an implicit respect for its legacy and a bit out of a necessity for somewhere to go, but lacking alternatives so accommodating.  Familiarity had even earned them semi-permanence:  a table they could claim as their own, a minor constancy that they could rely on, welcoming enough for many, and expandable if necessary, but comfortable and nearing homey for even the smallest party.  The waitresses knew them all by name (they never hired waiters, and those that did take the orders were either beyond fifty or under twenty, divorced and supporting a mortgage or single and supporting kids.  No one else need apply; there were plenty to fill those positions.) and simply made for the brown-rimmed carafe, a caffeinated testimony to their loyalty.  * * * * *  "In order to make you understand, to give you my life, I must tell you a story." -Virginia Woolf   More to come.....

       The Best Monday Ever..... Which Isn't Saying Much   So it's Monday, the day that the tie-clad minions of the corporate, profiteering empires dread every week.  Garfield was right - Monday really is the worst day of the week.  Or at least it is when your job sucks.  So why is my frown, upside-down?  I got my deposit back from Sprint, so they're back on my good side, and I got my plastic from Charter One, so they're on my good side, and I'm watching Family Guy DVD's of my very own.  So maybe it's not a super-cala-fraga-listic-ex-pee-al-i-do-shus day, but for a Monday, it ain't bad.

      * * * * *  A subtle quiet covered the battlefield.  No more triggers were being pulled, no cannons being fired; the only sound heard was that swords being replaced to their sheaths.  The captain returned his weapon to his side as well and glanced around.  The destruction was everywhere; moments before the entire expanse had lain in chaos, piercing screams shrilling over the sharp metallic ring of blade upon blade.  Now the field lay quiet, a desolate landscape of mayhem and remorse.  A small group of birds had sensed the return to safety and flapped over head and out of sight, like spectators leaving a match.  The unfortunate and gruesome duties of the survivor lay ahead, and the captain wasted no time in their delegation.  The captain walked among his soldiers, diligent about their task.  Regret is always deepest in those that sanction the order to kill; responsibility must be accounted for.  This was a day to be forgotten, but one which the captain would never be able to erase, the memories etched like acid into his mind.  "Captain!" one of the men shouted, his voice both urgent and unsteady.  Rushing to his side the captain was not prepared for the sight ahead of him.  Lying in front of them, coughing heavily and breathing heavily; a deep crimson marked the torso of his white uniform.  The captain fell to his side in hysterics.  The man lying on the ground had been, up to that moment, the captain's best warrior, a prize fighter who fought fearlessly and with unwavering ability.  The captain considered the boy, barely a man of 20, to be his protege, his son in his life away from home.  "No!  You cannot die!  You musn't... no try not to talk." the captain stammered on.  "I must speak," the boy replied.  "Please honor me these dying words."  The captain nodded.  "Thank you.  I fear that my life," the boy coughed violently, "has been largely in vain.  I have dedicated my life to fighting this fight, so that others would not have to, and the fighting never stopped.  It makes no sense - we fight for something we do not believe in, else we would not fight.  Please captain," he coughed, "lay down your sword.  Lay down your sword and be peace... show peace to everyone.  That is what we should believe."  The boy was growing very weak by this point.  The captain pondered his words very quietly and with a reverent air.  And then he rose, and removed his sword from its place at his hip.  "For you," he said, "I shall lay down my sword.  You have been an example to us all - if your body has gone in vain, may your spirit not be condemned to the same."  Upon his words, the captain knelt down and placed the sword in the boy's lap, and before the life finally left him, the boy smiled.  Perhaps the victory had been his.  * * * * *

      * * * * *  I never wanted things to turn out like this, but sometimes it's out of our hands.  Sometimes there are too many choices and when every one leads to the same conclusion, you question whether free will really exists.  It always ends up the same.  Is my decision actually of my own volition?  Or are we all guided by some cosmic mastermind, experimenting with human nature?  How do we know?  We are the peons of the trial, the rats racing through the maze; and where is our cheese?  It always ends up the same.  It only happens in a moment.  A pin drops and in that moment the world has changed - it only takes that moment for the shift, for your resolve to set itself.  You close your eyes and you kiss her.  It's inevitable - the attraction is too great.  It only takes a moment, that moment where your eyes catch one another, then close.  Then there's no turning back - it's inevitable.  The rest of the world no longer matters.  That moment, that place - they become the only importance.  Until your eyes open up again you are lost in a sea of inevitability, adrift in thoughts and motions that don't make sense in that moment - your mind is just not ready.  And when they do finally open, an explosion clouds your mind, the dust and debris scattering wildly through your head is too much to sort through.  It takes moments more for the dust to settle, for the full understanding to crash against you, like waves against the broad side of a boat.  But when it does you see what you've destroyed; the past lay in crippled pieces on the ground, a mosaic of change strewn in every direction.  No matter how you try to rebuild it, it could never be the same; it always ends up the same.  All said and done, nothing has changed - and yet, everything has.  The pieces are all still there, a jigsaw puzzle to be put back properly, but the product can never be the same, the prophetic Humpty Dumpty in reality.  It always ends up the same.  When you open your eyes, they're different, they're changed by knowledge, the knowledge of that kiss and its unspoken passion and desire.  And yet on the outside the mind sees the truth - it could be only just a kiss, lodged in immortality but open only to the past, not to the future.  Sometimes that's just the way it happens; sometimes no matter what decision we make, the result is the same.  Still, we make the decisions we do for reasons within our control.  Whether that's free will is a question I do not have the answer to.  * * * * *

       For an Old Friend   It seems I do have an audience, afterall.  A conversation with an old friend left me with that, so it is for her that I post some of my recent writing.  I sat down with my mother's manual typewriter the other day and started going.  It has a certain rhythm to it, an obligation to continuance that kept me writing.  It is an amazing thing, living in a world of temporary keystrokes, to have something so permanent after only a swift movement of the hand but that is how it was done for many years before me, and I feel many will continue the tradition like an old wives' tale.  To my old soul, my old friend, and my old typewriter, here it is.  * * * * *  The future is unwritten and often our only defense against the present.  It fosters hope - hope that conditions will change, that lives will improve, that there will indeed even be a future - and hope is a tenacious beast that can never die.  And if we can someday turn all our futures into presents, then we will surely achieve all our goals in this life.  Luke's goals were for a change, in either eternal direction, and he was steadily approaching those goals at a persistant seventy-two miles per hour, his gleaming black Jetta barreling down the highway, the definitive notes of Mozart by his side.  It was spring and the windows demanded their own absense, the cool breezes billowing freely through the rear of the car.  His are lay in the window's place, gently marking time across the car's freshly washed finish.  The lines on the road passed quickly, like the foam of a crashing wave, breaking with constant movement but never ceasing.  Luke's mind was many things, but settled it was not.  He was headed to a swanky hotel, the kind rented by the hour in cities, by the weekend elsewhere.  But his purpose was not that of the usual periodic privateer.  When Claire arrived, the attendant was sure to eye them both with sideways implications of lasciviousness and debauchery, two college age teens meeting in a back woods motel for a forbidden rendez-vous, a weekend tryst between star-crossed lovers.  But this was not the case, though once they had been lovers.  This was to be a platonic meeting, a meeting of once great minds to recount previous victories, to engage new challenges and inspire new dreams.  The were unique individuals and they exercised that their safehold should maintain that same uncommonness.  So rather than fight Hell or high water for an exclusive spot in some overly trendy coffeeshop, they chose solace in solitude; the ideas would be the same no matter the location, a notion the masses at those coffeehouses seemed never to understand.  Many people did not understand them - much like genius is seldom understood.  Anxiety had never been a companion of Luke's, and this situation was to be no exception.  He simply turned to Mozart's flowing melody and settled in for the long drive that lay ahead; it would be hours before he actually got there.  He chuckled and pressed down on the gas.  * * * * *

       For Once I Like My Job   I've come to realize something - my job affords me something lately I haven't been able to find elsewhere.  Time to write.  And though the results aren't great yet, I've written more just this week than I have in months combined before, so progress is being found.  Here's what I came up with over the past two days.  Enjoy.....  * * * * *  Knowing when you’re going to die is not a privilege many people are granted; now that I know, I’m not sure I want to, but once you’ve seen the light, the darkness never looks the same.  Given the option I’d rather be thrust into my death with only moments to think about it – getting run off a cliff by another car, or taking a stray bullet to the heart – because then I wouldn’t have to think about my life.  I wouldn’t have time to reflect on what a waste my life has been, to contemplate how many other things I could have done in the thirty-two years I’ve had.  And I’m not sure what’s more horrifying:  knowing that I’m going to die, or knowing that I’m going to die without accomplishing anything worthwhile in my life.  I was in love once, when I was ten, and her name was Gloria.  We had to sit next to each other in class because in the fifth grade, they started teaching you that cooties weren’t as awful as they were originally perceived.  We used to play catch and kiss on the playground, and I wouldn’t let anybody catch me but her.  But then, as with all great grade school romances, she moved a few towns over and though we wrote for a few months, a twenty minute drive was oceans away to two ten-year-olds, and the distance proved too immense.  Up until now, I worked as an insurance man for Cloister & Rogers.  And I was good at my job.  I got promoted; I made lots of money.  I was made partner; I bought a BMW – a red one.  It’s still in my driveway.  Even after all the gas stations went dry I still washed it every weekend, and sometimes on my lunch break.  I guess you could say I’ve been in love twice, then.  Now it doesn’t matter anymore.  Now the only thing that matters is finding Gloria.  I got her address out of the phone book – she hadn’t married.  Either that or she kept her own name; either way it won’t matter.  I just hope this bike is fast enough.  * * * * *  It all started with the US invasion of Iraq; it had long been a habit of the US to invade any country that didn’t want its help but held control of some resource they felt they were entitled to.  Manifest destiny or some similar justification was provided, and after a few years the fighting subsided, just like every other time.  But as time went on, and American troops remained in the area, people, and not just Americans, began to notice.  Though there was an Iraqi government in place, behind every official was a navy SEAL, behind every new law was an army ranger, behind every decision was the barrel of an American rifle pointing the way of progress.  That’s when the Chinese got involved.  For years since the US invasion, Iraqi officials had been negotiating a treaty with the Chinese, one of the few remaining nations that could still inspire fear into the American bully, and both countries knew this.  Wisely, the US absconded from the Middle East and sought alliances with its old friends, the British and the French, and both denied the friendship.  They also sought out the Saudi’s who wished to remain neutral, as did the Germans.  The US was slowly realizing that a bully’s life is a lonely one.  Oil at that point became scarce.  The Chinese were smart in their attack and understood that without their precious commodities, the Americans would be unable to respond.  They placed a few calls to the US major oil suppliers and suddenly the country was in crisis.  China was proving more powerful, and they hadn’t even raised a single gun.  The US threatened with nuclear weapons and the Chinese laughed.  They sought out allies, and the allies laughed.  They tried to plead with their citizens, and the citizens laughed too.  What had their country done for them?  The president at the time, General Leon Botstein did not enjoy being laughed at.  Growing up, Leon was rather diminutive in stature, and was heavily mocked for it growing up.  Rather than college, the General opted for the military, and trained harder than any other cadet.  When he was twenty-one he experienced a freak growth spurt, growing eight inches across just as many months.  He had already been made Lieutenant Colonel by that point, an achievement unequaled by any before him, and he was driven by thoughts of all the other students who had laughed at him for so many years before.  Everyone laughing at him brought back painful memories for President Botstein, and his clouded judgment decided to declare war on China, despite advisors warnings to the contrary.  “This country,” he asserted, “will not be bullied.  If we do not show the Chinese this now, our children will suffer the consequences of their influence.  We cannot just stand by and watch them destroy the way of life that so many lives before our own have fought to preserve.  Today we fight so that tomorrow, we won’t have to.”  * * * * *  I’m no longer afraid – at least not of dying.  Generally, I’m a rational man, as any good insurance salesman should be, and it didn’t take me long to accept the fact that survival was not an option.  There’s no feasible way around it – so now I need to use what little time I have left to do something worthwhile; something that will help me to die with a smile on my face instead of a frown.  I’ve only been in love once.  I met a girl in college named Suzanne.  She really liked me, and we hung out a lot.  One night we had too much to drink and she kissed me.  Her lips were cold and rough and I didn’t want to kiss her back, but the alcohol in me did.  I closed my eyes, and there before me was Gloria.  I kissed back with a new passion, visions of Gloria rolling through my head instead of the girl I was actually with.  That night we made an alcoholic love to one another and I stumbled home so as not to awaken next to the wrong woman.  It wasn’t long before Suzanne began to realize that she wasn’t the object of my affections.  My cheek hurt as she walked away and I realized that my unrequited love for Gloria was the only I would ever have.  After that I stayed clear of any ladies that showed interest in me, and any alcohol that did the same.  It’s funny how events like this can make you look at the world differently.  I don’t know why I never talked to her before, but I’m sure before I could have given you a number of reasons.  I guess I was blinded by the illusion of time; we always feel like we have so much of it, and it’s not until it’s almost gone that we realize how little we really do have.  The important part is that I know now what I need to do, what I need to say to her – if only I can get to her.  * * * * *  At first the Chinese didn’t take the US seriously.  With diminishing oil reserves and growing civil unrest, the assumption was that they wouldn’t even make it to their first offensive.  But the wily Americans had a few tricks up their sleeves, as well as barrels of government oil, and when the first jets were spotted over the South China Sea, the Chinese were taken by surprise.  They did not like this at all.  The Chinese warned the Americans that if they attacked again the repercussions would be extreme.  They did not heed the warning; the Chinese retaliated.  It was early morning when the bomb actually detonated.  The Chinese decided to strike a central region of the country as an example to the US.  Ground zero was estimated somewhere in the middle of Nebraska; Omaha was flattened, as was most of the state and even into those surrounding it.  Damage occurred up to three hundred miles away; the blast was felt up to five hundred.  It appeared that the Chinese had been engineering a more powerful bomb – the US became their test subjects, and President Botstein became furious over it.  “We have suffered a great tragedy, and our loss will not go unavenged,” he said.  The newspapers slandered the president:  ‘unavenged’ is not actually a word.  “They’ll all see,” he muttered quietly.  “They’ll all stop laughing soon.”  Unfortunately, he was right.  In negotiations with Chinese officials, the president threatened that every nuclear warhead in the US was trained on China, enough explosives to level the entire country.  But the Chinese laughed at him.  “You don’t have the courage,” they responded.  “Stop trying to play superpower.  Take your silver medal and go home.  We’re in charge now.”  Botstein didn’t take being insulted well.  Returning home, the general actually did aim nearly every warhead in the nation on China.  He called to warn the Chinese officials and give them one last chance at reconciliation.  Not only was he laughed at, but he was hung up on as well.  President Leon P. Botstein could take no more:  he gave the order to fire.  The Chinese retaliated with merciless vengeance.  Nuclear warheads were headed towards every major city in the US and the rest of the land in between would be ruined by their destruction.  After that, it was just a waiting game until everything touched down.  * * * * *  I rang Gloria’s doorbell and rocked uneasily back and forth from one foot to the other; the end was this close and I was nervous, not about the end, but about a girl.  The footsteps cresendoed towards the door and then she was upon me.  “Can I help you?” she asked.  Her voice was more beautiful than I ever could have remembered; puberty has a way of doing that.  “Gloria?”  “Do I know you?”  Obviously the years had changed my appearance beyond recognition.  “We went to grade school together.”  I was shaking, and my voice was trembling audiably.  “We sat together in Mrs. Townsend’s class.”  A look of nostalgia overtook her.  “Fifth grade, right before the move.  I remember that – who are you?”  “Thomas Banner.  Little Tommy Banner?”  I could see her mind searching for the answer.  “It… it doesn’t sound familiar.  I’m sorry.”  “Sure, you must remember me.  We used to play catch and kiss on the playground.  I always used to let you catch me.”  “I used to catch a lot of boys,” she paused as if acquainting herself with me.  She didn’t remember.  “So you don’t remember me?”  My voice was shaking now for a different reason.  “No, I’m sorry, I honestly don’t.  But I’m flattered…” I didn’t hear any more of her words.  I’m not even sure if I said goodbye.  I remember wandering away from her doorstep, sullen and defeated, shoulders slumped and a light rain graduating into a torrential downpour.  Eventually I crumbled to the ground in an empty field and lay amongst the puddles.  I no longer wanted to live, and soon my wish would be granted.  Eventually, I went unconscious.  The impact wasn’t long after that.  * * * * *

       Silence in the Mist   Nobody out there comments - nobody reads.  When I'm published, you'll all be sorry.  Mwuhahahaha.....  * * * * *  In 1977 a boy by the name of Harold Dane Wilbur was born in the small town of Manilas, NY to a modest family of less than modest size.  Harold was the twelfth addition to the Wilbur clan of Manlius, though he would not be the last.  His younger sister Margaret came next, only three minutes and twenty-eight seconds later.  Growing up the two were inseparable, whether in play or at rest; buried in books, or building a fortress of pillows in their parent’s bedroom.  As they progressed through school they were always at the top of every class and graduated with honors, Harold as Valedictorian, Margaret as Salutatorian.  Harold went to Yale; Margaret went to Dartmouth.  On weekends they met in Boston and caught up in between concerted study sessions.  Harold was pursuing an engineering degree; Margaret was studying politics.  Neither had strong ties at college, having spent the majority of their weekends away and their time on campus focused on their studies.  They graduated Cum Laude in the spring of 1999, on the brink of a new millennium.  Harold left for a job working for General Motors in Detroit; Margaret had been granted an internship in Washington, DC.  The two had never been apart their entire lives, and the new lifestyle was initially a great shock.  Harold survived by plunging himself into his work – within a year Harold’s first project had been engineered and released to the public.  He had devised an onboard system for vehicles that used the Global Positioning Satellite system to track a vehicle in the event of a breakdown or theft.  Within another three months it was reporting data such as airbag deployment and engine diagnostics.  After another three, it had grown so sophisticated that it could offer driving directions and restaurant suggestions, could remotely unlock your door in the event of a lock out, and could even warn you that you were driving over the speed limit.  Margaret handled the situation a little differently.  After a few weeks of hermitage, Margaret forced herself into the Washington social scene and she adapted with the prowess and grace of a seasoned veteran.  Before long she was glad-handing influential government high rollers and it wasn’t much longer before she was delegating orders to them.  After a while boredom settled in and Margaret set her sights to higher aspirations:  she aimed for congress.  The two still flew to see each other when they could, exchanging banter like they had never been apart and would each talk about their respective work, Harold on his new developments with new secure locking mechanisms and fingerprint identification technology, and Margaret her influence on the new bill banning the use of cell phones while driving.  “How could you enforce it, though?”  Harold asked after she had finished voicing her objections.  “Well I suppose a cop would have to catch them in the act, as with any crime.”  “But there wouldn’t be any proof – all you’d have is a policeman’s word.  The courts wouldn’t prosecute that.”  “So what are you trying to say?” she asked me.  “Give me six months.”  And sure enough, six months later an onboard system was released, engineered solely by Harold, which recognized when drivers were using their cell phones in their vehicles.  Margaret saw to it, with the help of Harold’s latest project, that her bill passed through congress, earning her acclaim among their ranks.  Both were ecstatic – they were working together once again.  They kept in better touch at that point.  Harold had been promoted to a project manager; Margaret had gone to work for the Department of Transportation and had risen to management effortlessly.  When they talked it was never just business, but it was always business first.  Keeping each apprised of their respective businesses helped the other in their own profession they found, and each continued earning acclaim.  One day Harold shocked Margaret with an announcement that she could never have seen coming.  “I met a girl,” he managed to squeak out through his ever-broadening smile.  Elizabeth Duvane was a humble girl out of Boworth, Kansas, with long chestnut hair and dimples like a golf ball.  She had a cute, shy countenance and to see her laugh was to watch angels to descend from heaven.  Betsy, as she was known, after dropping out from the prestigious Wayne State University, had taken a receptionist position at General Motor’s central headquarters as a way to make ends meet.  She was living on her own at that point and working a second job at the Little Gem Diner a few nights a week to help save some cash.  Harold hadn’t noticed her at first.  Stumbling into work everyday his mind was fumbling over equations and solutions and didn’t bother much with the rest of the building.  It was only after she hailed him from her desk for a message that he finally noticed the beautiful Kansan and fell in love.  They were married eight months later.  And for a while things progressed normally.  Harold continued his job engineering better and more efficient computer systems for cars.  Margaret continued her climb and finally earned herself a seat in the House of Representatives, and Betsy quit her job and went to work keeping house for Harold and herself.  Margaret’s ambition was boundless, however, as was Harold’s, and on their next phone call the two discovered another situation they could improve.  “I’ve been doing a lot of research lately, and you know what I’ve found out?  The most common infraction of the law in this country in all age groups is speeding.  Never would have guessed it myself.”  “I suppose that makes sense.  We’ve all gotten one at some point.”  Harold sympathized with the speeders; he happened to have a bit of lead in his own foot.  “What were you thinking to do about it?”  “Well, you’ve done work with the onboard computers, and with cellular services.  Would it be possible to monitor cars speedometers and transmit the information via cellular towers?”  “I suppose it could be done, but wouldn’t that be illegal?  That starts to infringe on invasion of privacy.”  “Leave that part up to me.  But can it be done?”  She almost seemed too eager.  Harold sat and thought for a while; you could almost see the equations pouring out of his ears.  After a while a distant smile formed on his lips.  “Yeah, I think I could do it.  But it would take a long…”  “I’ll give you six months,” Margaret interrupted.  And sure enough, six months later Harold had completed a sophisticated system no larger than its predecessors that would report the nation’s speeding habits over the nationwide wireless network.  Harold made millions, Margaret was made a senator, and Elizabeth got a maid, and speeders everywhere cringed.  A few months later, Harold received another call from his sister.  “Good evening, Senator.”  “Don’t patronize me like that, Harry… it does have a nice ring to it though, doesn’t it?  ‘Senator Wilbur’”  “It certainly does, Maggie.  What’s on your mind?”  “It’s always something, isn’t it?  We’ve been reviewing the statistics on the speeding issue over the past two months since the announcement and we’re incredulous.  Nothing’s changed.”  “Nothing?”  “Nothing significant.  That’s kind of why I was calling.  I know you like a challenge – why do you think that is?”  Harold was silent for a while and Margaret just imagined him in a Rodin style pose, pondering the problem.  “Well, have there been any more tickets handed out?  Do the police know that they can know where these speeders are?” “We were planning on ticketing people at their addresses, using the DMV mainframes to match up the vehicles and addresses, but you can only tell where the vehicles are, not who they are.”  “It’s easy.  Just set up a relay station.  Then you don’t need the DMV.  The police use GPS now – you can just rally the closest cop to the scene.  Nobody will dare speed after that.”  “Thanks, Harry!  That was the solution I was looking for.  You make me look brilliant over here, you know that don’t you?”  “And you keep me busy over here.”  They both had a laugh about that one.  “How’s Betsy?”  Business first, but never just business.  Within the next month, more speeding tickets were issued than any precinct had ever witnessed before.  By the next month, the numbers were at record lows.  And everyone was pleased:  Harold got an award, Margaret got a raise, and Elizabeth got pregnant.  And traffic infractions as a whole were down, not just speeding.  It seems fear was wrought into the American mindset; Big Brother was watching more than just their speedometers.  -  “Oh my God!” Betsy was screaming from the next room.  “It’s time Harold!  Let’s go!”  The baby was coming, and not just coming, but coming early.  Almost three weeks so.  Harold grabbed the bags they had prepared and his wife and bolted for the car.  They were out of the house faster than any of their practice times, but neither one of them cared.  	“Keep breathing, honey.  Keep breathing,” Harold was coaching, trying to keep his eyes on her.  “Heeee, Heeee, Hoooo.  Heeee Heeee, Hoooo.”  “You’re doing great, honey!  We’re having a baby!”  Harold was now watching her as intently as possible.  His focus was not on the road, and certainly not on his speedometer.  He barely noticed the flashing lights behind him, and it was only then that he did check it.  Sixty-five in a forty.  “Keep breathing, honey!” he kept coaching.  She was still breathing, though labored and weak.  “Don’t leave me now!”  Harold looked in his rearview mirror, then shrugged and pressed down further on the gas.  The car rumbled in response; the flashing lights behind him continued.  It wasn’t for another few miles that Harold spotted flashing lights up ahead and began cursing.  Betsy was now focused entirely on her breathing.  When they stopped, she never asked why, and with pointed guns and megaphones the cops asked Harold D. Wilbur to please step out of his car.  Harold was crying when he laid his hands on the hood, screaming that his wife was inside the car and needed to get to the hospital.  The guns did not waver.  One cop got close enough to the car to notice his wife, passed out on the back seat, her chest rising and falling slowly, her ballooned stomach oscillating in time.  He yelled to the others and jumped in the car, speeding it to the hospital.  Harold was not brought to the hospital.  His one call was placed to his attorney and bail was quickly paid and Harold hailed the first taxi he could find towards the hospital.  He was sprinting full speed past doctors, nurses and orderlies.  When he reached her room he was gasping for breath, barely able to breathe.  Betsy lay awake in the bed, turned away from the door, but she rolled over when she heard the troubled breathing.  “Oh, Harry!” she gasped.  He ran to her and hugged her.  Her eyes were bloodshot and accompanied by bags beneath them, and her lips had been drawn to an immutable frown.  She just held him back and sobbed for a long time.  “She’s gone,” she said at last, among her tears.  “They said I’d be fine but… oh, Harry!  Why?  If only… ten minutes Harry… that’s all he said it could have taken!  Ten minutes… Oh, Harry she’s gone!”  Harold was unable to move for a long time and when he finally could, he found he no longer wanted to.  * * * * *  Hope you all enjoyed the show.....

      It's one of those days again, but really, I think there's been some build-up to it.  The stupid people have to go.  There's no need for them on this planet - other than as slaves - get off my planet.  I don't want to deal with them.  Incontinent idiots that can't maintain more than one thought in their brain.  You ask a question, they answer something you didn't ask.  Stolid stoners that vehemently believe that smoking everyday has no permanent damage - get off my planet.  You just don't SEE the damage - you ARE the damage.  Smokers in general - you'd really have to hate yourself to do that.  I don't want any part of it.  I don't want a cigarette, I don't want to inhale your second-hand smoke.  Get the hell off my planet.  And it is my planet by one justification only - I will make this world better through my actions, not worse.  I want to educate.  I want to extend the life of this world, and my own life, as long as possible.  Show me a smoker that can say that - I'll laugh in their hypocritical, jaundiced face.  The part that scares me is that maybe it isn't my planet.  Maybe this is a planet of policy-goers and brown-nosers that care more about getting by than getting noticed, that care more about doing what they're supposed to rather than what's right, that care more about common practice than common sense.  Maybe I'm the one that needs to get off their planet and let this one go to waste.  I just can't do that.

      The Warner Brothers broadcasting station is running a program to find the  worst  singer in the country and rewarding them with $100,000 AND a recording contract.  An add quoted Aristotle in saying that 'We make war, that we may live in peace', promoting war as an  American  characteristic.  The U.S. Government spends EIGHT times more money every year on the military, than on the education of its children.  I was promised more than this.  This is not the country that was founded so many years ago, forged from principles like integrity and justice.  Our ancestors would weep.  I was promised a land where the best from amongst us would thrive - but the search is out for the worst.  I was promised a country that was founded to avoid discrimination and prejudice as unnecessary - but we wage war against those we do not understand, we let the integrity of the world wain.  I was promised a country that could do anything if it just put its mind to it - but we don't aspire to mental strength; we promote physical strength and the use thereof as our token to the world.  I say we because I am an American, and will continue to be one as long as it is possible.  But it is not the country I grew up learning - I was raised loving this country only to find its insides hollow and its integrity vanished; its morals askew, and its people perverse.  I remember growing up praising the divine force that I was born an  American , and now I damn that same force.  July 4th will be different this year.  Celebrate all you want - I'll be in mourning.  Here's to the USA, and everything it stands for.

      So the site's changed a little bit.  I started with a new template - I like it better than the old one, and I think it suits me better.  I changed the title.  Though most people have never heard of it, it's actually the title of a story written by a Ukranian (a nationality that constitutes part of my demeanor) named Nikolay Gogol.  So that's my disclaimer - I can't credit for the title, only everything underneath it.  The hope is that I'll be posting more - mostly with new writings, but sometimes with life updates.  Most everything is the same monotony that has been present for a while, so as changes come I'll be sure to get them out in the open.  Things of note:  I may have my first official writing job.  I was recently acquainted with a college student who was looking to start a new magazine, and I'm getting in on the ground floor.  It's called Rabble Rouser and the focus is going to be on independant music, so I'll probably be spending lots of time at Milestones.  Assuming it takes off there's going to be an online version and a quarterly print, which, with popularity, could become monthly.  So buy it.  More details to come.  Music of the Moment: Teitur - Sleeping with the Lights On, Mieka Pauley - Day by Day

      I like to watch the rain sometimes A thousand thoughts float free in my mind Like a thousand drops of quiet rain Rolling like a train down my windowpane And that train of thought, it always turns to you There's nothing I can even try and do Something about lonely nights like these That bring thoughts to me like the wind through the trees  So tell me if it's going to last Through all these thoughts - thousands of questions waiting to be asked Is a thousand miles too much Or can a thousand kisses save a love that's too far apart to touch  A journey of a thousand miles they say Begins with a single kiss baby So close your eyes just this once I want to remember the way you look when we're done Soon those thousand miles will be in our way And you won't be able to hear me say I love you a thousand times over and over And when that doesn't seem enough, a thousand more  And I don't know if this can last There's too many thoughts - thousands of questions that still haven't yet been asked Is a thousand miles too vast Or can a thousand phone calls bridge a love that's meant to last  A thousand years of you won't satiate Even if a thousand years is what I have to wait This thousand miles might be paved with a thousand tears But it's worth it all to make those miles disappear A thousand miles like a thousand raindrops Streaming southward like a train without a stop Each one a thought in my head of what to do A thousand different thoughts, about a love I have for you  Now I know that this can last These many thoughts have become the answers to thousands of questions having been asked A thousand miles is never too far A distance only measured in miles can't compare to a love that lasts forever
