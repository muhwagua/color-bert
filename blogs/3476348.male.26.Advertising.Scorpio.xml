      I would have never thought the end of the world would be so ... dull.  I went and saw "The Day After Tomorrow" yesterday, and was not overly impressed. Don't get me wrong, its not a bad movie. The visual effects are pretty darn outstanding, there is some nice action set pieces, a wolf attack, a Russian ship floating down a New York street (an idea which my Mum thought was hilarious) and reasonable acting all round.  The problem is it's just dull. I can't quite put my finger on why but maybe it's the simple notion that you know they aren't going to fix it all up at the end. And you sure as hell know which main stars are going to survive, so ultimatly it just comes down to watching them go through their paces.  I love end of the world movies, especially the cheesy, fun, bad ones like Independance Day, Armageddon, Deep Impact etc. They tend to be large, overly produced, CGI filled popcorn fests. Seeing two Americans destroy the massive invading alien force with a computer virus in ID4 is such a stupid, ridiculous and out there self serving ending, that you can't help but laugh. Sadly there is no such moments in Day After Tomorrow.  Really, it's not bad. it's just dull.

      The Darwin Awards have been awarded for 2004, but unfortunatly aren't available on the  urlLink website  yet. So here they are in reverse order, and remembering that they are all true.   No. 7    A young Canadian man, searching for a way of getting drunk cheaply, because he had no money with which to buy alcohol, mixed gasoline with milk.  Not surprisingly, this concoction made him ill, and he vomited into the fireplace in his house.  This resulting explosion and fire burned his house down, killing both him and his sister.   No. 6    A 34-year-old white male found dead in the basement of his home died of suffocation, according to police.  He was approximately 6' 2" tall and weighed about 225 pounds.  He was wearing a pleated skirt, white bra, black and white saddle shoes, and a woman's wig.  It appeared that he was trying to create a schoolgirl's uniform look.  He was also wearing a military gas mask that had the filter canister removed and a rubber hose attached in its place.  The other end of the hose was connected to one end of a hollow tube approx. 12" long and 3" in diameter.  The tube's other end was inserted into his rectum for reasons unknown, and was the cause of his suffocation.  Police found the task of explaining the circumstances of his death to his family very awkward.   No. 5    Three Brazilian men were flying in a light aircraft at low altitude when another plane approached.  It appears that they decided to moon the occupants of the other plane, but lost control of their own aircraft and crashed.  They were all found dead in the wreckage with their pants around their ankles.   No 4    A 22-year-old Reston, VA, man was found dead after he tried to use octopus-style bungee cords to bungee jump off a 70 foot railroad trestle. Fairfax County police said Eric Barcia, a fast-food worker, taped a bunch of these straps together, wrapped one end around one foot, anchored the other end to the trestle at Lake Accotink Park, jumped and hit the pavement. Warren Carmichael, a police spokesman, said investigators think Barcia was alone because his car was found nearby.  "The length of the cord that he assembled was greater than the distance between the trestle and the ground" Carmichael said.  Police say the apparent cause of death was "major trauma."   No. 3    A man in Alabama died from rattlesnake bites. It seems that he and a friend were playing a game of catch, using the rattlesnake as a ball. The friend, no doubt a future Darwin Awards candidate, was hospitalized.   No. 2    Employees in a medium sized warehouse in West Texas noticed the smell of leaking gas.  Sensibly, management evacuated the building, extinguishing all potential sources of ignition; lights, power, etc.  After the building had been evacuated, two technicians from the gas company were dispatched.  Upon entering the building, they found they had difficulty navigating in the dark. To their frustration, none of the lights worked. Witnesses later described the sight of one of the technicians reaching into his pocket and retrieving an object that resembled a cigarette lighter. Upon operation of the lighter-like object, the gas in the warehouse exploded, sending pieces of it up to three miles away.  Nothing was found of the technicians, but the lighter was virtually untouched by the explosion. The technician suspected of causing the blast had never been thought of as particularly 'bright' by his peers.  AND THE WINNER IS.....   No.1    Based on a bet by the other members of his threesome, Everitt Sanchez tried to wash his own "balls" in a ball washer at the local golf course.  Proving once again that beer and testosterone are a bad mix, Sanchez managed to straddle the ball washer and dangle his scrotum in the machine.   Much to his dismay, one of his buddies upped the ante by spinning the crank on the machine with Sanchez's scrotum in place, thus wedging his testicles solidly in the mechanism.  Sanchez, who immediately passed his threshold of pain, collapsed and tumbled from his perch. Unfortunately for Sanchez, the height of the ball washer was at least a foot higher off the ground than his testicles are in a normal stance, and the scrotum was the weakest link.  Sanchez's scrotum was ripped open during the fall, and one testicle was plucked from him forever and remained in the ball washer, while the other was compressed and flattened as it was pulled between the housing of the washer, and the rotating machinery inside.  To add insult to injury, Sanchez broke a new $300.00 driver that he had just purchased from the pro shop, and was using to balance himself.  Sanchez was rushed to the hospital for surgery, and the remaining threesome was asked to leave the course.

      Ok, lets play pretend you're a serial killer for a moment. You killed kittens and puppies as a child, maybe even wet the bed a few times. Maybe set fire to your sisters Barbies. You've spent mucho time thinking about killing someone and you figure you have it all worked out:  Weapon of choice? Check. Rope or other method of detainment? Check. Type of victim and location picked out? Check.  You go out, find your victim, lure them away, torture them or what ever you sick freaks do and finally off them.  Now, its time to dispose of the body. You drive you and your rather silent new friend out to a deserted location, say a forrest or maybe a drainage ditch somewhere.  You haul the body out of your boot, give the body one last longing look, grab a shovel and... OMG! WTF! Neighbours is starting in a half hour!! Got to get home for that!!  I guess you better just cover the body with some sticks and leaves and stuff. No one will ever find it and trace it back to you with forensic science will they!!  Why are most serial killers morons!!? According to most books I have read about them, many serial killers are of above average intelligence. So why, WHY do they after spending so much time fantasising about capturing and killing someone, and actually doing the deed (or doing the dead as many are necrophiliacs), spend so little time in disposing of the body?  Spend a couple of hours digging a hole and bury the body properly ya' lazy bastards! That way bushwalkers won't stumble over it some bright sunny day and lead you down the path of doom!!  SHEESH! No one takes pride in their work these days and end up doing a half assed job.  Lift ya' game Serial Killers!

      I was out with  urlLink Jimbo  the other night for his partner's graduation get together.  As I was perusing the drinks menu (Which I can't actually partake in because I'm DISEASED!!) I noticed that they had Absinthe on the list. When it came time to order my non-alchoholic girly drink, I mentioned to the barmaid that I've always wanted to try Absinthe (the colorful drink that make you INSANE! Seriously, it looks like Dr Herbert West's re-animation serum from the movie Re-Animator) and it's just a shame that you can't get the real, full strength stuff here in Australia, due to the Government's nanny like laws.  "Oh no!" she replied, "This is the proper imported stuff. That's why its $13 a shot". My eyes opened wide in delight and I was *this close* to ordering one, until I remembered, I'm DISEASED!.  But no matter. At least I know its there now and  urlLink Jimbo  and me have made plans to partake of this particular poison at some point in the nearish future. So if a post suddenly appears on here talking about green fairies and how I'm a talking Hippopotamus, just ignore it (like it would be that out of the ordinary anyway).

      I hate hopital waiting rooms. Especially for stuff like Diabetes. Because most of the patients waiting are old, and they smell. And they look at you funny when you're young like, "Come here little boy and let me suck your youth away".  It wouldn't be so bad if it was like, a ski resort hospital, cause it would be full of ski bunnies that got an owwie on their tushie, and I could be like, "Hey Babe, I can ski the K-12, let me make it all better".   Man, it would be sweet if I was going to that hospital.

      So it turns out that I have Type 2 diabetes instead of Type 1. This means that I shouldn't have to take insulin (well maybe again when I get older), and can just take tablets instead. It also means that my body is not quite as shot as I thought it was.  I'll be taking Metformin for the next 6 weeks at least, until my next appointment and will still be monitoring my blood sugar level every meal to make sure it's on track, but this is all good news. With good eating habits (I hate the word diet), exersise and losing some weight (which apparently is reasonably easy to do on these tablets), I should be well on the way to making life a little more pleasent at least.  The only problem with taking these tablets is they give you nausea for a while, which I have right now, so I will have to avoid milk and a few other foods for a while.   Also, apparently they can give you the trots as well, so I have that to look forward.

      That in a very small set of circumstances, I could possibly fall in love with a guy. Personality wise, I could be so compatible with a guy that I could experience an emotional state akin to love. As per the topic we were actually talking about, I also pointed out that I just couldn't bring myself to do the physical side of it. You know, all that Queer Eye stuff (and I don't mean tzushing and home decoration).  They, of course, laughed. I guess some people just aren't as honest with themselves as I am.

      Second in my series of posts containing strange yet compelling poetry found in spam emails. This one curiously came from myself, and was about a penis enlarger. You would think if I was selling that stuff, I would have used it already.  Anyway, please start your beat-nik drums for this gem:  "She read me over and over. One day she had a picnic on a hill. My hill. I saw my own stump. He came with his father and some friends. They worked hard, and built a tree house in me! I thought of all the joy I had given this family. The happy little boy and his kite. The father and his newspaper.  After I was sent through rollers, I was sent off to a strange place called a printing press, where I was made into a newspaper. The big sister and her book. For once in a long time, I was happy. Suddenly I felt strange and...different. As they sent me through rollers I fell asleep, expecting never to awaken. I didn't bother to read myself. I was too tired. When I woke up, the little boy's father was reading me!"

      My dear old Ma's Pea and Ham Soup Recipe:  This really is a great winter soup recipe that you can make and freeze so you always have something yummy to eat. You can of course put any veges you like in it. Personally I like it as thick as possible, but if you like a thinner soup you can just as more water. It costs under $15 to make.  You need:-  1x Packet of Split Green Peas 1x Boiling Bacon (From Woolworths, it's in a string bag, inside a plastic bag) 2x Potatoes 2x Carrots 3x Sticks Celery  To Make:-  1. Soak peas overnight 2. Rinse peas under water in the morning 3. Place Boiling Bacon in a stock pot. 4. Place split peas around bacon. 5. Put in other veges (after chopping up) and cover to top of bacon with water. 6. Put lid on and bring to boil, then remove lid. 7. Turn to mid heat and simmer for 1 hour. Skewer bacon and if soft, it's cooked. 8. Take bacon out and let cool.  9. Mash up the peas and veges in pot. 10. Dice bacon up and return to pot. 11. Simmer for further 20. 12. Eat with crusty buttered bread.

      I went and saw this on the weekend and after enduring massive lines and many, many annoying children, I managed to find myself a seat, put on an intimdating look and avoided having anyone sit near me in the packed out cinema.  As a fan of the first Shrek, and after hearing mostly great buzz (not to mention that its now the most successful animated movie ever), I have to say I was a bit disapointed. It's a good movie, very funny in parts, most of the jokes come off pretty well and Puss-in-Boots is an excellent character, but somehow I was left wanting a little more.  I think the problem is that they tried to do too much with it. The first movie was quite intimate, mainly concerned with Shrek, Fiona and Donkey, but the new movie adds way too many characters and too many setups.   I had a headache on saturday morning when I went to see it, so I put it down to not really being in the mood, but I saw it again via a bootlegged DVD last night and had much the same reaction. Maybe it's just me, but I think I'm becoming slightly more discerning when it comes to movies. Mind you, I did buy and watch "Teen Wolf" over the weekend so maybe my judgement is not to be trusted.  It's one of those movies I think you have to make up your own mind about. I enjoyed it, but I enjoyed the first one more. 3 Stars.

      I've lost some weight recently, or more accurately I have lost some body shape. So my pants, which were always kind of loose to begin with, have been really loose even with a belt.  Last night my belt spectacularly commited suicide, leaving me without said belt, and no replacement. Now, when I walk, my pants fall down if I don't hold them up as I'm waddling along.  I wonder if this kind of stuff happens to other people?

      Renny Harlin, director of the new (and probably totally unneeded) prequel to The Exorcist, has commented that  urlLink many weird things happened  whilst filming said movie.  "Harlin added that other "weird little things" characterized the nine-week shoot of the prequel."  1. They stayed at a (world famous) Hotel that was mentioned in the original movie.  2. Someone's room number was 666! Oooooooo spooky! Frankly I would be more freaked out if the room number was 237 (Cheers to anyone that gets that).  3. Oh, and Renny Harlin got hit by a car 2 weeks into the shoot. Yeah, that's definitely the work of Pazuzu. Cause people don't get hit by cars every day... right?  So he's come up with a lame 2.5  minor  things that happend. I'm betting more spooky things happened filming "Herbie Goes to the STD Clinic". I call lame PR story bullshit on this whole thing. Its been tried and pulled off way before you Renny.

      I swear I'm going to write a pamphlet called that.  Its taken me a whole week to get around to writing this because frankly I've been through it with so many people and told the story so many times I didn't want to go through it again. But since I'm skiving off doing work this arvo I thought i would get it down.  I haven't been feeling great the last few months. In fact, I have been feeling down right crappy. But in the last month or so I have felt like shit. Headache, nausea, constant thirt, peeing every five minutes (every 2 hours whilst sleeping), weak and tired. Being a man, I figured it was a virus or something and would all go away if I just ignored it.  My sister and mother ganged up on me and forced me to go see a doctor last friday. I had to pee in a cup (which was a new experience for me, dispite what you may have heard). She did a keto test on it and I had large amounts of ketones in my urine. She insisted I do a blood glucose (sugar) text, but she couldn't get any of the readers in the medical centre to work (and for this privilege I paid $83), so she had the girl take some blood and rushed it to Royal Perth Hospital (RPH), telling me to go to the emergancy ward down there and get the results.  So off I toodle, thinking I'm gonna go into an office and get told "Oh you're borderline diabetic, loose weight, eat better", maybe get some pills. Didn't quite work out that way.  When I got there, I showed them the letter that the GP gave me, and before I knew it, I was on a trolley bed, being wheeled around the emergency department, then put into a bay, told to take off all my clothes and put on this rather fetching backless gown, which they  definitely  don't make for the fuller figured bloke.  More blood tests, this time out of both wrists and I was starting to feel like I had the stigmata.  They made me pee in a cup again (I had to walk to the toilet clasping my butt-flap closed) after which they stuck a saline drip in me and then promptly forgot about me for 45 minutes.  I wasn't too upset. i got to watch all the weird going on in the ED. I swear some girl was a junkie, and there was an old man that was having problems with his eye. When told that they wanted to keep him in overnight, the first thing he said was "I can't. I haven't got any clean underwear with me". Ah, now there's a boy whose Mother raised him rigtht.  Anyway, after a while they came back and told me to get dressed and I would be taked to the Diabetes department. I was told that I definitely have diabetes but still not sure what type. For the time being though at least I have to measure my blood glucose level every time I inject myself with insulin, which is four times a day (breakfast, lunch, dinner and before bed). Its not too bad actually. A lot better than it used to be apparently.  Hopefully my blood sugar will stabalise and I will be able to switch over to taking a tablet, but only time will tell. I still dont know if I have type 1 or 2 diabetes. But to give you an idea, a normal healthy person should have a blood sugar level of about 4, and anywhere between 4 and 10 is acceptable. I am routinely registering between 12 and 18. It is going down now slowly with the insuline, but its still pretty damn high.  So all I can say is, listen to your body. If it tells you somethings wrong, get it checked out. Wear a flannel shirt to the doctor if you're worried about looking like a wuss.  Oh, and shout out to all the peeps at RPH. You were all great Yo'!

      I was sitting at home last night, quite happily watching Neighbours and about to have dinner when I got a knock on my door.  I opened it to find two people, a guy and a girl standing there with clip boards. Usual sales drones I thought.  The guy says (in an Irish accent), "Don't worry, we're not here to try and change your religion or anything". He laughed and she laughed and I laughed. Then he says, "Actually, our TV broke down and we were wondering if we could watch the Simpsons at 7.30 with you?"  Now, I'm not usually taken of guard very much, but I have to admit that this one threw me. After hmmmmmming for a few seconds I of course said no. "No, really we just want to save you 30% on your phone bill, blah blah blah". He laughed and she laughed and I didnt laugh.  I politely turned him down. I think he rather thought he had built up a repore with me.  He didn't. Dick.

      I've had an interesting development in the last few days.  About a month ago I had dinner at my Dad's house for his birthday. Me, my sister,my dad, his lady friend, and a friend of my dad's got together on the saturday night and had dinner together. Nothing too unusual about that right? Well it wouldn't be, except for what I found out over the weekend. From the Saturday West newspaper.   "Second accused killer remanded.    A second man charged with the wilful murder of 18-year-old Sarah Ivanina made a brief appearance in Perth Magistrate's Court yesterday.  Terrence Alexander Wells, 54, of Rivervale, is accused of killing Ms Ivanina at Belmont between February 1 and February 2 ths year. Her body was found last month dumped in a roadside drain at a North Dandalup farm.  Mr Wells did not plead to the wilful murder charge and he was remanded in custody until June 24. Any application for bail has to be considered by the Supreme Court.  Earlier this week, Ms Ivanina's 18-year-old boyfriend appeared in Perth Children's Court also accused of her willful murfer. He cannot be identified because he was 17 at the time of the alleged crime. He will be back in court on Wednesday.  Ms Ivanina, who had lived in Lockridge, is alleged to have been strangled."   You guessed it, the friend that came to dinner was Terry Wells, father of my best childhood friend.  Now, of course he hasn't been found guilty of anything yet, so I am certainly not pointing fingers, but it's pretty creepy none the less. For what it's worth, my dad's pretty convinced that he's innocent. But then, lots of people said that about  urlLink David Birnie  as well.  If he is found guilty, maybe I can ask him why  urlLink killers are so lazy  about body disposal.

      ...I think we need some time apart.  It's not that I don't love you, you know I do. It's just... lately you haven't been fulfilling my needs. Over the years we've laughed, cried, been angry and been inspired together. We've been from the highest highs, to the lowest lows. Together.   It's just, with your recent infatuation with reality shows like Big Brother, Popstars, Survivor, American Idol etc; and your penchant for killing off all the shows I like, well, I think we need to re-evaluate our relationship.  As you know, I have been flirting off and on with the dvd player for some time now. It gives me what I need, when I need it. Any time, day or night. It doesn't get cranky and give bad reception when it's cold outside. It always happy to watch what I want. I'm not saying it's we're gonna go exlusive. The dvd player understands that I need to do other things. I'm also making friends with some books and maybe even start going out to the gym more.  But don't worry! I'm not abandoning you all together. You're still one of my best friends, and sometimes I like nothing better than coming home after a hard days work and just chilling out on the couch with you. And besides, we still have a standing engagement to watch Neighbours together at 6.30 every night.

      I'm sure many of you have  urlLink  seen this   recently on the news or on some current affairs show. The story of a Big Fat Baby!  This isnt anthing new, you can see it practically everyday on shows like Springer, the Ricki Lake show, Maury Povich and the like. But it still boils my blood. HOW are the parents not charged with child endangerment? I don't give a fork what the doctors say, that kid is morbidly obesse. The weight isn't going to suddenly dissappear as he gets older. He's gonna die.  Now, I'm a fat guy, but at least as an adult I am responsible for what I put on my plate, and consequently what goes in my mouth. This kid, and his obesse brother, don't have this luxury. It all comes down to what the parents feed them. You cannot convince me that's just baby fat or he's just "big for his age". His parents over feed him, and feed him totally the wrong foods. Case closed.   The kids should be taken away from them, until such time they can prove themselves to be fit parents. Just one more reason people should need to pass a course, and a psych exam before they are allowed to be responsible for children.

      I thought I had about $10 in my transfer account (the account I keep general play money in, so I can buy DVDs etc. It's seperate from my general holding account and my savings account), but when I went to check the balance today, I found they have taken my monthly fees out. Those fees? $19! So I was actually in the red by -$12!  Wankers!! I hate the banks. But I need them to live. It's just the same with Willy Wonka and his Oompa Loompas.

      How funny was Krystal on Big Brother Nominations last night!!? She had obviously been given a crash course on how to play to the camera and she'd obviously taken it to heart. She was like one of those ping pong ball clowns at the royal show, right down to the plastered on grin (maybe she was just plastered?) as her head followed the camera around. As a friend pointed out to me, as the camera guy was pulling back from Gretel (haven't we all at some point or another), he couldn't get around Krystal's boobies. Ah classic tv. And for the record, I actually do like Krystal, I think she's hot. And I don't normally like girls with big bazoombas.  As I was driving home last night, a bus pulled up to me at the lights and as I looked over I was treated to the horrific sight of Dr Harry Cooper's ugly mug staring straight in my passenger window. Now I can't stand Harry, and when I wore a younger mans clothes, I heard a story about him from a guy I was living with. He reckons that a friend told him (so you can tell how accurate this story actually is) that he knew a guy that went to vetenary school with Harry here in WA. Apparently, Harry had a fondness for getting caught in rather compromising positions with the animal folk at the university. Knuckle deep within the borderline indeed. Frankly, I choose to believe the story, dodgy source and all. Because he's a twat.  Later last night, I was flicking around the box and happened across the show "Two and a Half Men" on Nine. It's a horrible show, one of those classic examples of American sitcoms that should never gotton free of the birthing canal, yet somehow has survived for at least one season. Normally I would have hit the next button and ended up watching some other drivel on another channel, except for the fact that  urlLink  Melanie Lynskey   is now a bit player on it.  I've enjoyed watching Melanie's carrer ever since she got her first break in New Zealand playing Pauline the sad, lonely, possibly lesbian psycho schoolgirl (my favorite sub-genré) in Peter Jackson's "Heavenly Creatures". Plucked from obsurity at a high school, she has gone on to act in such luminary movies as "Coyote Ugly" and "Ever After" with Drew Barrymore. I think she's actually quite talented, and since losing that pudgey private school look of Heavenly Creatures, quite hot.

      I think I just did a little throat vomit.  I have just signed myself up for a brand new car. A metallic silver 2004 Hyundai Elantra sedan to be precise. It's a big financial commitment, but one I am finally ready to commit to again after having a string of bad financial dealings over the last few years. Plus this will help improve my credit rating.  It was touch and go with this car, getting finance and all, but I managed to squeak through. It's the first time I've ever had a new car (My dad being a mechanic/tow truck driver, they have always been fixer-uppers) so I am looking forward to getting it. It's got power steering, air con, power windows, a huge boot to store dead bodies in and air bags.  Of course, there's a lot of stuff involved in getting a new car. You have to keep up with regular servicing, having to make sure your insurance is paid up, making sure there is always oil in it (a big problem for me) and of course, after the warranty is up you have to pay big bucks to get these new computer cars fixed. (At least KITT talked).  But it's time to stop living like a poor student and start cruising for chicks in my new car like a 50 year old with a mid life crisis.  Yay me!

      Anyone that knows me knows that I'm a Batman nut. So I present to you some new Batman Begins...stuff.   urlLink Photo of the new Batsuit . Still not sure about this, I will have to see it in action. But I guess they just cant go back to using a fabric suit like in the 60's series. Even though its probably one of the more comic accurate versions.  You can also view the new  urlLink teaser trailer . It looks so SWEET! I got chills watching it.

      I was lying in bed last night and it was really really windy and howling outside. Not raining though.  I like to sleep with the window a little bit open for airflow and last night, for fun, I imagined that I was sleeping in a little cabin at the top of the swiss mountains. In the middle of winter, no one around, no sound but the wind and the creaking of wood.  I encourage everyone to try it. It doesnt have to be a cabin. If its hot, imagine you are sleeping in a hut on a Fijian beach.  Use your imagination! That's what its there for!

      I had a dream last night about a girl I used to know. Since I'm feeling in a bit of funk because of it, I figured I would share the story with you all. I'm a dork, so what?  I first met Tamara when I was working at Chicken Treat. They were opening up a new store in South Perth and her and a bunch of other people where training at our store.  First time I saw her she was wearing a white sweater and looks gorgeous. I was in year 12 at the time, but we got talking and she asked me what I was doing at Uni. I had to laugh at that, and from that moment on I was hooked.   She was always very friendly and we got on really well. She was in first year Uni, studying Bio Technology, or as she put it, "Jurrasic Park stuff".  Anyway, after about 2 weeks, I came into work to find that she wasn’t there. The training had finished. *Dum dum dum!!*.  Anyway, about a year later I just happened to walk into the South Perth Chicken Treat to find Tam working the counter. She remembered me and we got to talking. But again I was to be stymied!  I started going in regularly to see her, but one night I went in and she wasn’t there. Now, I was a little upset cause I'd planned on asking her out finally.  I had her address from seeing her personal file in the office once, and besides, her name is reasonably unique so it wouldn’t have been too hard to find her anyway.  In a fit of sheer confidence and audacity that had never been seen from me before or since, I drove to her house and knocked on her door. She answered, still in her uniform (She'd left early, slow night).  I smilled, said I was sorry that I had missed her and would she liked to go out sometime? She was suitably taken back, but agreed. On the drive home the adrenaline wore off and I almost fainted.  Anyway, about a week later I borrowed a friends car and we went out to dinner (Funnily enough just around the corner from where I now live). It was a nice night, I think she enjoyed herself as well. I was young and naïve and tried to make the night like something in a movie. Didn’t quite pull it off. I would do things a lot different today.  When we got back to her place, I told her I had a nice time and would she like to go out again. She said she would, but that I had to know she was seeing someone. I was gobsmacked! I left her place that night very very confused, if not a little hurt.  I decided that being her friend was better than not knowing her at all, so we started a friendship that lasted a while. We would go out to the movies, have a bite to eat, nothing major. Occasionally she came over and we'd watch a video or something.  In hindsight I know now what I liked so much about her. She always called me on my bullshit. I should also mention that I got a job as a kitchenhand at the Chicken Treat she was working at. I wasn’t stalking her I swear. I just needed the money. Working with her was just a bonus.   Once, I was waiting for her to get out of work, I was laying on the bonnet of my car with my hands behind my head in what I imagined was a Brando-esque pose. She came out and the first thing she said was something like, "Are you trying to look cool?". Heh, God love her.  Another time we were driving and having a mini debate about something. I said something stupid like "You don't know anything about me". She of course replied, "Oh what, like you're so dark and mysterious?". Funny thing was, that’s exactly was I was trying to give the impression of. She could always see through my crap.  She had her 21st at home, under a big tent in her backyard, and I felt quite honored to be invited. She was with another guy, but so what? I loved her anyway.  Before we sort of drifted apart, we were driving again, and I turned to her and said, "You know, we would be really good together". She gave me a simple "I know", but never explained why she wouldn’t be my partner.  After that, we saw each other less and less. There's a few other stories in there that I wont bother with, but suffice to say I found her pretty amazing. If I could ever meet a girl just like her, I would be a happy guy indeed.  And that’s the end of that chapter.

      I woke up this morning, as I frequently do, disorientated and a little groggy.  This is usually about the time my mind is at it's most crazy. The other morning I awoke to find I had no idea where I was, or even the layout of my apartment (I say apartment in an attempt to sound cool and sophisticated, like I live in some New York style loft or something. In reality, its just a dingy flat). It took me a full two or three minutes to work out what was going on.   Anyway, I came to, and a funny thought ran through my head... "I wonder what Bass tastes like? I bet it tastes sweet, like sugar". Now, understand I'm not talking about the fish Bass here, but the subwoofer, doof doof type bass you get out of your stereo. Bay-ss. Not Baa-ss.  Man, my mum must have taked some gooooo-oood drugs when she was pregnant with me.

      Ok, seriously, CSS layouts for webpages rawks!  I still know next to nothing about how to do it beyond the basics, but it looks really powerful. I've always built pages using tables, which works but frankly is a pain in the butt to do (as I'm sure many of you know).  If I can get the skills down, and then learn how to make pages that work well, AND degrade to older browsers, I will be a happy little web geek.  Ah, seperation of content and style. It's a grand thing.  (Geek mode off)

      ...which makes them... stupid.  "Four men claim the Wayans brothers stole the idea behind the movie "White Chicks" from them. "White Chicks" stars the Wayans as black FBI agents who pose as young white hotel heiresses. The movie has grossed $37.3 million since it opened June 23. The mens' script, titled "Johnny Bronx," is about a bumbling black FBI agent who impersonates a white man to infiltrate the mob."  Er no. That's like claiming "Mrs Doubtfire" was a rip off of Tootsie.

      Now we all know about the whole Terry Wells things, along with psycho blog comments, but I have had two things happen in the last few days that makes me believe that Death is keeping a close circle around me.  On Sunday,  a woman was found not 500 meters from my house murdered in a kebab shop.  Last night I found out that some people I knew, albeit not well (though my sister did), died in a horrific car accident in the Adelaide hills. The mother, father and adult daughter were hit by a truck that pushed them 100 meters into the bush. They died instantly. The daughter, Miranda had just been married 3 months ago.  Just goes to show that it can happen at any time, to anyone.

      I got home from the gym last night to catch a story on Today Tonight about a fat kid (I think he was about 13) who had always been obese and picked on etc. He decided to do something about it, and has lost 56kg (almost the same amount of weight I want to lose) in 12 weeks by exercising and changing his eating habits.  His eating plan was this:  Breakfast: high fibre cereal with skim milk Lunch: 1 tub low fat yoghurt Dinner: 1 Salad sandwich Snacks: fruit  While I think its great that he decided to stop eating all the junk food, put down the playstation controller and do some exercise, I think this eating plan is ultimately detrimental to his health, and unsustainable for a long period. Hopefully now he has shed the weight he will start eating a more balanced diet. Experts agree with me that dropping that much weight in such a small time frame is very very dangerous.  While I want to see more kids bucking the obesity trend, I want them to do it safely and wouldn't encourage them to do this extreme plan.

      I've been whinging to people around me for some time now that I have no hobbies, no projects, no "thing" that I do. I don't mean work or even collecting DVDs (184 and counting!), but one thing that I can spend my other free time doing. Something I can get really good at.  I've been playing around with the idea of taking some photography courses and maybe setting up my own black and white darkroom. I've also been putting quite a bit of energy into thinking about getting a motorcycle. I've had my licence for about 8 years now and never ridden a bike since I got it. I've wanted to get into motorbike touring around this great land of ours, as well as learning general maintanence etc.  Now these are all great things to do, and ones I intend to persue in the future (definitely in the case of the bike, I'm about halfway there to being able to afford one), but I realized last night that I actually have a ready made project/hobby just sitting there (literally) waiting for me.  My body. No not like that you dirty birds!  I mean, with all this stuff happening with the Diabetes, and having to lose weight and eat better anyway, I figure I might as well turn it into a hobby and do it properly. I swear I'm not going to turn into one of those "My body is a temple" kind of jerks. I'm not going to be sitting at a party expounding on how many reps I can do or how I can crush walnuts with my butt cheeks (14), but I can focus on getting better, feeling better, eating better and looking better. I think that's sounds like a pretty good project to me.  Anyone want some freshly crushed walnuts?

      The reason I haven't posted anything for a while is that nothing of note has happened at all.  Well, I did buy some new towels on the weekend if you find that sort of thing interesting.  And I did watch all of "Dead Like Me - Season 1" over the weekend, and am now watching "Stargate SG-1 - Season 2" at the moment, but thats not really that exciting for you all to hear about now is it?  My mum is having a birthday party on Saturday night so I may have a few stories next week about it. If I can remember anything. I'm planning on getting reasonably wrecked so we will see.

       urlLink First footage of the new Bat Mobile  from the new movie "Batman Begins"!  That looks SOOOOO sweet. Many of you will hate it, but trust me, it's closer to the Batmobile than most of the other film versions. Remembering also that this is about Batman's first year on the job, so naturally he wouldn't have modified it too much just yet (it starts out as a new military terrain vehicle).  Enjoy!

      ...and I guess that makes me chump numero uno.  I just called the car yard and was told that it will be probably another week till I get my new car.  It's actually not that bad now that I know that I AM getting the car, but like pretty much all people in western society I want everything NOW. (Just imagine me running around a chocolate factory in a little red dress and everyone calling me Veruca till some weird guy calls me a bad egg and I fall down a chute to my certain death).  For those interested, here is a badly scanned picture of  urlLink the car I'm getting , including the free alloy's and spoiler on the back.
