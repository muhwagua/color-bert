      I did it!  Steve's computer is running perfectly.  And  this  new graphics card was up and running (quite nicely, I might add) in less than an hour!  Now he can play his 3-D game all he wants.  My friend,  urlLink Keithius , posted a neat map in his online journal that shows the states he's visited.  So, following his lead, I've posted one too.  The map is no longer available online, but I've listed the states that I've visited:  Arizona, Connecticut, Washington D.C., Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia.  It's interesting to see where different people have been in their lifetimes.  With any luck, I'll be able to add many more states to the list, as I may be driving cross-country to help a friend move from the southwest to the northeast over the summer.  I'd also like to drive to North and South Carolina to visit Laura, my friend from Ithaca College, whom I haven't seen for three or four years.  I'll also be taking a trip to Colorado and maybe some other states out that way with some friends from work in September.  (I've visited Canada, France, and the United Kingdom too -- and I'd love to go back -- but that's it.  So, it's not worth posting a world map.)   By the way, I don't know if everyone was formally introduced to Zippy, my new car!  It's a 2003 Honda Civic EX sedan.  I bought it brand new in June 2003.  It's a great little car!  It packs plenty of punch with its 127hp 1.7-liter SOHC 16-valve VTEC 4-cylinder engine and 5-speed manual transmission.  Safety isn't a problem with the dual front air bags, 3-point seat belts, Immobilizer anti-theft system, remote keyless entry, and 4-wheel anti-lock brakes.  Although the ride quality is typical of any compact car, comfort is emphasized by air conditioning with a filtration system built-in, AM/FM/CD stereo, cruise control, power windows, power locks, power mirrors, variable intermittent wipers, and front  and  rear beverage holders.  Lastly, its sleek look is accented by factory fog lamps, a power moonroof with tilt feature, 15" wheels, tinted glass, integrated rear window antenna, and a rear window defroster with timer.  Economically, it boasts great fuel mileage: 32 mpg in the city, 38 on the highway.  It's been a great little car so far.  I hope to keep it for many years, running well, and seeing every bit of highway that there is to see!  "Well, if you ever plan to motor west, take my way.  Take the highway, that's the best!"  (Any idea where that quote is from?)  *grin*  Well, I best be off.  Enjoy the rest of the day, and don't forget to root for the Patriots tomorrow!  It's game day!

      I'm proud to say, I just completed my 2003 federal and state tax return forms!  It was fairly simple, actually.  It took less than three hours, believe it or not!  And I had some weird things to report too (because of distributed pensions/annuities, student loan interest deductions, etc.).  My federal tax return won't be quite as sizeable as I'd hoped, but with any luck, my state tax return will make up the difference.  I won't know until I actually complete the Telefile process.  My brother, Steve, asked me to install an ATI Radeon 9600 3-D graphics adapter in his computer last weekend.  For the computer-savvy readers, it was an AGP card -- not "Plug and Play."  I tried and tried for a total of more than 24 hours, but I was never able to get it working properly.  I'm not a computer guru, but I tried everything that I could imagine, and then I called for technical support.  Their suggestions were even more useless than my own failed attempts!  "Try this."  "Try that."  "Download this."  "Install that."  "Change this."  All of their suggestions made the computer  very  unhappy.  It would just about load Windows, and then it would reset itself.  It wouldn't even start in "Safe Mode!"  So, lucky me: I got to spend last Saturday reinstalling Windows on my brother's computer.  Anyway, we returned the problem graphics card, and bought a new one.  This one is a Nvidia GeForce 2.  It's a PCI card, but still not "Plug and Play."  Tomorrow's the big day.  I'll try it again!  My jaw is slowly getting better.  I called my dentist to describe the symptoms, and without a formal examination, he said that it sounds like a condition called TMD or TMJ.  It's a disorder in the jaw joint that causes the jaw joint to dislocate, lock, crack or pop, and also cause severe pain.  The cause is unknown, but stress-induced tooth grinding or jaw clenching is suspected, as well as pre-existing conditions.   urlLink WebMD  has a good article about it if you really want to read it.  Well, I should go to bed.  It's after 5 a.m., and I have a lot to do tomorrow.  Good night!

      When a person provides a service for someone, would it be too unreasonable to expect  some  kind of expression of gratitude in return?  The simple act of saying, "Thank you," to show appreciation for the person's efforts seems to be too difficult for most people these days.  Class, respect, courtesy, consideration of others, and basic manners are all lost arts.  It's sickening, really.  All day, I busted my hump at work -- in single-digit temperatures and sub-zero wind chills -- loading luggage for passengers who were riding my bus between Framingham and Logan Airport.  Some of the luggage was obnoxiously heavy too, and of 97 passengers throughout the entire day, just two people made the effort to say, "Thank you."  Most people grabbed their luggage and ran.  Even the custom of  tipping the driver  to reward pleasant and safe service seemed to be forgotten.  (After thirteen and a half hours at work and five round trips to Boston, I came home with just $17 in tips.)  One guy actually tossed his duffle bag at my feet and said, "Will you take this so I can get on the bus?  It's cold out here!"  Apparently, it never occurred to the self-centered  pig  that I might be cold too.  Hmm....  The two gentlemen who did say, "Thank you," made my day worthwhile.  One of them noted that I was professional, efficient, safe, and thorough.  He thanked me for doing my job properly.  The other gentleman and I had a very nice conversation during the 30-minute trip to the airport.  We talked about our jobs, our educational backgrounds, and our life experiences.  As he got off the bus, he said, "Always follow your dreams, and never be ashamed of driving a bus.  It's only for the interim, but you obviously enjoy what you do, and you do it well.  I admire you.  Thanks!"  No, thank  you  sirs!

      Well, the last few days have been pretty uneventful.  I did get to see Jesy for a while on Saturday, though.  She's doing well, and she's lost a lot of weight!  We went out for a late lunch at Friday's at the Solomon Pond Mall.  Then, we wandered through the mall for a while afterward, chatting about anything and  everything .  It was a good time, and it's nice to know that I still have a few friends who are still willing to talk to me!  You know, for several years, my dentist has encouraged me to have all four of my wisdom teeth removed because they're all impacted.  He said that they're "ticking time bombs" that will definitely give me trouble someday; it's just a question of when.  Needless to say, I haven't followed his advice yet because I'm a big baby when it comes to pain.  Well, yesterday, my jaw suddenly started to hurt very badly on the left side.  It feels like the pain could be in the joint that connects the bottom jaw to the top jaw, but regardless of where it is, it's excruciating.  Thankfully though, it only jabs me once in a while when I move my jaw a certain way or if I yawn.  I don't know what's causing the pain, but I'm praying that it's actually my jaw -- not my impacted wisdom teeth.  This morning, I received an e-mail from Ericka, my friend from North Carolina.  We met online about a year ago, and we've been chatting pretty regularly ever since.  But this morning, she informed me that her family is short on cash because her parents have been out of work for a while.  They have to reduce their expenses by canceling their internet, cable, and telephone services.  So, we basically said good-bye for now.  I felt so helpless.  I can relate to her family's financial situation though; I've been there myself.  If my parents hadn't been able to bail me out, I don't know where I'd be today.  Ericka's situation is worse though because she's part of a big family -- maybe five or six brothers and sisters.  I wish them all the best!  Hey, on March 7, I'll be going to the Calvin Theater in Northampton to see Roseanne Barr!  I've been one of Roseanne's fans for years.  The tickets were a bit expensive, but I'll call it a "belated birthday gift" for myself.  (By the way, my birthday is just around the corner: February 27!)  Supposedly, this is a beautiful theater, and it's just outside of Springfield.  I can't wait for the show; I've always wanted to see Roseanne Barr in one of her comedy acts.  It should be awesome!  Anyway, I best be off.  Tomorrow's my day off, and I've got plenty of things to keep me busy: laundry, some cooking, fixing the family's computers, errands, etc.  If my jaw doesn't start getting better in the next couple of days, I'll probably have to make an appointment with the dentist or doctor too.  (Yay!)  So, good night....

        Music and Lyrics by Edith Gassion, Marguerite Monnot, Geoffrey Parsons Performed by Josh Groban    Le ciel bleu sur nous peut s'effondrer Et la terre peut bien s'écrouler Peu m'importe si tu m'aimes Je me fous du monde entier Tant que l'amour inondera mes matins Tant que mon corps frémira sous tes mains Peu m'importent les problèmes Mon amour, puisque tu m'aimes...  J'irais jusqu'au bout du monde Je me ferais teindre en blonde Si tu me le demandais... J'irais décrocher la lune J'irais voler la fortune Si tu me le demandais... Je renierais ma patrie Je renierais mes amis Si tu me le demandais... On peut bien rire de moi Je ferais n'importe quoi Je ferais n'importe quoi Si tu me le demandais...  Si un jour la vie t'arrache à moi Si tu meurs, que tu sois loin de moi Peu m'importe, si tu m'aimes Car moi je mourrai aussi... Nous aurons pour nous l'éternité Dans le bleu de toute l'immensité Dans le ciel, plus de problèmes Mon amour, crois-tu qu'on s'aime? ...Dieu réunit ceux qui s'aiment!

      This weather is getting to be too much!  The sub-zero temperatures and gusty winds have made my job ten times more difficult during the last week.  First of all, diesel fuel gels when it gets cold, making it extremely difficult to start the bus' engines.  And once they're finally running, they take  forever  to warm up -- usually more than an hour -- so heat generally becomes a luxury (unless we break the law by running the engines constantly).  Second, wind and high-profile vehicles  definitely  don't mix.  With each gust that hits the bus, the driver has to compensate by counter-steering to maintain a semi-straight path.  These buses are so wide, there's isn't a lot of room to drift before the bus drifts into the next lane.  And that happened several times today.  One gust hit my bus so hard near the Boston University Photonics Building, I drifted about five feet into the next lane, even though I was over-steering against the wind.  It was a near miss for the guy in the BMW sport utility vehicle who was almost sandwiched between me and the guard rail.  (Oops!)

      Well, my new work schedule goes into effect today.  I'm thinking that it could be the perfect new schedule!  I have virtually the entire day off, and then I go to work in the evening.  I go late enough to miss the rush of passengers.  I'll miss most of the rush hour traffic.  And I'll be working a few less hours every week, which will give me a chance to have a life again!  (Woo-hoo!)  I'm not sure that I'm going to be crazy about having my days off split up, Tuesdays and Saturdays, but time will tell.  Everything else might make it worthwhile.  We'll see.  Maybe I'll actually be able to see my friends again!!  Sweet....  We got a bit of snow last night.  And weather forecasters are predicting that more frigid temperatures are on their way.  In fact, tomorrow night, they're predicting temperatures to drop to as low as -9 degrees Fahrenheit.  (!!!)  Dang!

      I  really  need to blow off some steam, or I'm going to blow a gasket.  I can't deal with the  crap  anymore!  Do you realize that I have gotten just  one  full night's sleep since I moved back into my parents' house in May 2002?  (By "full night's sleep," I mean more than five hours without interruption.)  It doesn't happen here!  My "bedroom" is nothing more than a cubicle in a corner of the basement -- no walls, no doors, minimal heat, and certainly no privacy.  Hmm....  And everyone wonders why I'm so desperate to move out!  Every damn morning, the dog barks incessantly, or some disrespectful sibling bounds up and down the basement stairs.  The latest kick is an engine rebuilding project that left piles of tiny metal shavings all over the basement floor.  Needless to say, about half of them are embedded in my foot now.  Thank you very much!  And can I tell you how much I  loathe  traffic?!  The "Big Dig" is an underground tunnel system that was "designed" by top engineers to eliminate traffic congestion in Boston.  Seems to me, they've successfully moved the city's traffic existing traffic problems to a new site  underground  -- for the overrun price of just a few  billion  measly dollars.  They should just blow the entire city up and try again!  The airport is a total joke.  There are so many mindless morons that drive into the airport without a clue.  None of them know where they're going, but they still drive way too fast -- while talking on the cell phone and reading hand-written directions at the same time.  Who cares about all of the other traffic, or even the massive signs that could actually tell you where to go?  They shouldn't even allow people to drive into the airport.  Subway, buses, taxis, or limos... that's it.  (That's how it already  IS  at other major airports across the country.)  Today, for the first time, do you know that I  actually  considered using the bus to crush a minivan --  on purpose ?  She just stopped, not at the curb mind you, but in the middle of Terminal B on a blind curve between U.S. Airways and American Eagle.  Let's stop and park...  HERE !  Who cares about the big red bus with the pissed off driver behind us?!  Move it or lose it, baby!  You're on my turf now!  And ask Keithius: we drivers of the big red buses fight to the death, especially at toll booths.  *innocent grin*  (For the record, I'd never hit another vehicle intentionally.  I might bully them a little -- or a lot -- but I'd never hit them intentionally.  However, the situation  is  highy frustrating.)  *sigh*  I need a massage.  And about a gallon of kahlua.  But instead, I'll hopelessly try for a full night's sleep.  Thanks for listening, and good night.

      Tonight, I had a long talk with Kayla about our plans to share an apartment.  Sadly, she expressed serious concern as to whether she can afford the financial commitment that an apartment entails.  While she's confident that she can afford the monthly rent and utility expenses, she noted that she would be unable to save any money for her graduate studies, which are only a year away.  (...pretty good reason to be concerned, I'd say...)  So, she's going to spend some extra time at work to see how much money she earns in the next two or three months, and she said that she'd make a definite decision then.  I'm a little disappointed, only because I really liked the townhouse at Sturbridge Meadows.  I can't lie, though: I admire Kayla's sense of financial responsibility and planning.  It's something that I didn't have when I moved into my own place for the first time, and I'll be feeling the negative effects for a long time.  Of course, too, I'm very grateful that she expressed these concerns  now , rather than after we'd entered a lease agreement.  So, time will tell.  Hope for the best!  If Kayla's unable to share the townhouse with me, then I'll probably start looking for a smaller apartment of my own in the Douglas, Millbury, Oxford, or Webster areas.  With any luck, I can be on my own by July or August.  I also talked to Amanda, my friend from South Carolina, tonight.  We haven't had an opportunity to chat for some time, but tonight, she informed me that everything has been going very well for her lately!  She and her boyfriend found a very nice home at a very affordable price, they became engaged during the Christmas holiday, and Amanda recently found out that she's expecting a baby!  She'll be due at the beginning of September.  (Congratulations, Amanda and Paul!!)  It was just the kind of good news that I was hoping to hear.  I had a brief chat with Jennie tonight too.  (Tonight was the night for online conversations -- five of them at once at one point!)  She's been busy, but she's doing well.  She noted that she ran into Joey and Jim at the grocery store in Webster this evening -- to whom I also spoke today!  Joey was recently promoted at work.  Although I'm not entirely sure what kind of responsibility the promotion brings, she was excited to tell me that her pay increased, which is always a good thing, no matter  who  you are!  (Congratulations to you too, Joey!)  She's been hoping for this promotion for some time now.  I'm glad to hear that everything is working out.  So, today is just about over.  Actually, technically, it  is  over, but who's counting?  *grin*  I'd been getting pretty burned out at work lately, and my normal two days off weren't enough.  So, I called in "sick" today.  They must have felt badly for me because they gave me tomorrow off too!  (Don't worry: I worked enough extra hours last week to take today and tomorrow off, and I'll  still  break even.)  So, Thursday is going to be another lazy day, and then I'll be going back to the salt mines on Friday.  And that leads me to me final bit of news.  Every six months, the drivers at my bus company can choose new schedules.  The process is call "bidding."  Well, I opted to change my schedule with this bid, and I got my first choice!  It's all based on seniority, so I had to choose from what was left.  But I'd been hoping to get a weekend day off, and I did.  My new schedule gives me 50 hours per week with split days off.  ...work a few days, get a day off, work a few more, get another day off...  Here's my new schedule, effective Monday, January 12:  SAT:  Off SUN:  11:30am to 1am MON:  5pm to 1:30am TUE:  Off WED:  5pm to 1:30am THU:  5pm to 1:30am FRI:  2:30pm to 1:30am  Friends and family are welcome to come for a ride once in a while.  If you'd like to know what times I'll be departing on any given day, drop a line!  Send me an  urlLink  e-mail   message, or call me when you get a chance.  If nothing else, it'd be great to hear from you!  Good night!

      Kayla and I spent yesterday afternoon looking at various properties in the Sturbridge area.  We looked at several, including Sturbridge Meadows, Laurel Ridge Apartments, and Rosemeade.  They were all very nice, but Sturbridge Meadows interested us the most.  It's a 2-bedroom townhouse.  On the first floor, you'll find a half-bath, a modest kitchen, a large dining room and living room that open into a private patio.  On the second floor, there is a full bath, a master bedroom, and a second bedroom.  The entire unit boasts approximately 1,200 square feet with a lot of storage space for a pretty reasonable price.  It also offers washer and dryer hookups inside the apartment, air conditioning, ceiling fans, mini blinds, bay windows in the dining room, private parking, snow removal, and more.  But best of all, this property is only 2 minutes from the turnpike, and all shopping areas are very close-by too.  (Click   urlLink here   to check out this property!)  We're hoping to apply for residence in March or April so that we can move in May or June.  We'll be looking at other properties too, and who knows, maybe our plans will change completely by then.  But for now, this is what we've got in mind.  What do you think?

      I'm free!  I'm free!  ...for two days, at least...  At work today, my reputation for being the "bus breaker" reaffirmed itself.  (I broke  two  buses today.  Not just one bus, but  two !)  Actually, neither breakdown was the result of my doing, but I'm sure I'll hear about it nonetheless.  I sent one bus back to the garage, listing to one side, and the other was making a very obnoxious "thumping" noise from the right front wheel.  So, combined with the rude and cheap people that I drive around all day, I came home a true burnout.  *crooked grin*  I've been telling you about how I'm planning to locate a place of my own.  I'd prefer to have my own apartment or something -- without roommate(s) -- but I'm not 100% sure yet that I'll be able to afford a place of my own without taking on a part-time job to supplement my current income.  (In reality, I could  easily  handle the expense by myself, but I'm just concerned after the debt that I incurred while I lived in my last apartment.  Things are different now -- I have a reliable job that pays pretty well, and I don't have a million other expenses to worry about either -- but the potential for another failure scares me.)  Anyway, I've been talking to Kayla, and since she's looking to find a place of her own too, we're considering the possibility of sharing an apartment, like the arrangement that Keith and I had.  Actually, Kayla called me today and said, "Want to go house hunting?"  *frightened shiver*  Very scary!  Kayla's cool though.  We almost grew up together, and we're really great friends.  We'd just have to work out a few details because she'd be commuting to college in Springfield, and I'd be commuting to work in Millbury.  I'm hoping that we'll be able to find a place in the middle (like in Southbridge, Sturbridge, Fiskdale).  It's all still up in the air, and a lot could happen between now and then, but it's something that we're tossing around.  I'm just a little worried about what people might think: a guy and a girl living together, unmarried, not even dating.  Hmm....  It'd be like "Three's Company," but with two people instead.  I'm pleased to tell you, too, that I've lost four pounds this week (since last Monday)!  You'd never know by looking at me, but that's what the scale said.  I've been taking this diet pill, called Fiber Thin, and it seems to be working.  I'll continue the program for a few more weeks to see if I'm actually losing weight or not.  This could be good!  Oooh....

      At the beginning of each new year, millions of people create resolutions.  These personal promises of sorts usually involve changing or doing various things.  The same is true in my case.  While I've learned a lot in the last two years, I've turned into a person whom I really don't like.  I'm discouraged and disappointed by my failed attempts to leave the nest, so to speak.  I'm almost repulsed by my own reflection in a mirror.  I'm turned off by my own attitude and personality at times.  So, I've resolved to change all of these things:  I plan to pay off most of my debts and move into a place that I can call  my  home -- and I  will  succeed!  I plan to lose a significant amount of weight so that I can tone some muscle and become physically fit.  I plan to be more selfless, optimistic, patient, observant, respectful, and caring.  Most importantly, though, I plan to have fun!  Life is so short; enjoy it while it lasts.

       CURRENT MOOD:   Happy and Relaxed.  LISTENING TO:   "Nimrod" by Sir Edward Elgar.  Today was a good day!  I was able to sleep in for a change, and I lounged around the house until about noon.  As I was getting ready to go to the bank, I dropped my cell phone, and it fell down the basement stairs.  Sadly, the antenna broke, but I used the damage as an excuse to buy the  urlLink new phone  that I'd been wanting.  It was a pretty big unexpected expense, but thankfully, I won't be set back too far because my federal tax refund arrived yesterday.  Plus, this phone is built a bit better than the last one, I think.  After I got home from the Sprint PCS Store, my family and I went to Boston for the evening.  We had dinner at Bennigan's in the Theater District.  I had "The Monte Cristo" sandwich; it was so good!  I finished it off with a glass of Bailey's Irish Cream on the rocks.  (Yum!)  Then, we continued up Warrenton Street to the Charles Playhouse, where we saw  urlLink Blue Man Group .  I'll spare the details in case you haven't seen it yet, but I will say that it was fantastic!  I'd even go back to see it again if I had the chance.  It was a good time; we all had a lot of fun.  My  urlLink new headlights   were  delivered yesterday too.  They look great -- and they do work properly (I checked) -- but my brother's going to have to install these for me too.  (The grille, front bumper, and inside fenders will have to be removed in order to install the light assemblies.)  Steve knows a lot more about auto body work than I do.  He said he'd try to get to it on Monday afternoon (so that if he doesn't finish it, he can continue into Tuesday because I won't have to work).  So, we'll see....

       CURRENT MOOD:   Frustrated.  LISTENING TO:   "Rugrats" on Nickelodeon.  On Monday, I ordered the new headlamp assemblies for my car.  They were shipped immediately via UPS Ground (for $25).  All of the UPS maps and time calculators  guarantee  that packages shipped on Monday from Canoga Park, CA to Sutton, MA will be in transit for four business days to delivered by the end of business on Friday, February 27 (my birthday).  However, the package tracking details specify a scheduled delivery date of Monday, March 1.  I could have shipped this package through the Post Office -- for  less than $5  -- and it would have  arrived  in  three  days!  Plus, unlike UPS, the Post Office even delivers on Saturdays!  So, naturally, I did the American thing to do!  I paid  five times  more than necessary for a delivery service that will take  twice  as long!  What's wrong with this picture?  And what's wrong with UPS?!  Bastards.  Neil, one of my co-workers, called my house this morning.  He said that I never turned in his paperwork after I relieved him on Monday.  Our boss is looking for the paperwork so that he can record Neil's hours.  *groan*  I'm really batting a thousand down there this week!  I was in a rush after work; I must have forgotten Neil's paperwork in my briefcase.  I'll turn it in today, and everything  should  be all set.  I never did make it to Jesy's place yesterday evening.  She'd been having trouble with her truck again, and by the time she got there, it was after 7:30 p.m.  It takes 45 minutes to get there from my place, and I didn't want to be out too late.  So, maybe we'll try again next week.  We'll see.  What have you given up for Lent?  Anything?  I don't know about you, but being Catholic, this is supposed to be a season of fasting for me.  So, I'm using that fact as motivation to begin a proper diet.  Too often, I grab whatever is convenient: McDonald's, Burger King, D'Angelos, Subway, Boston Market, etc.  Hence, I am about 60 pounds overweight.  Yesterday, though, I talked to Jennie for a bit.  She told me that she has a gym membership somewhere, and usually goes for about an hour before work, three or four times a week.  I could probably do the same thing if I don't succumb to laziness, so I might look into a membership at the Community Center in Northbridge.  Proper exercise combined with a proper diet will help me lose the extra tonnage that I carry around wherever I go.  Oh, the possibilities....  Well, I should probably start getting ready for work.  I have to go to a bit early to find Neil's paperwork and be sure that I've turned it in.  I also have to start my paperwork for the night.  Tomorrow, I have to go back to the bus company at 9 a.m. to be trained in a few other kinds of buses so that I'll be more versatile if I ever have to do a charter trip again.  It should take three to four hours, and then I have to go in for work at 5 p.m.  Anyway, I go now.  Fung Wah, out!

      Today, we celebrate  Mardi Gras , the last day before the fasting season of Lent.  It is the French name for Shrove Tuesday, or the day before Ash Wednesday, which marks the beginning of Lent.  Literally translated, it means "Fat Tuesday" and was so called because it represented the last opportunity for merrymaking and excessive indulgence in food and drink before the solemn season of fasting.  In the cities of some Roman Catholic countries, the custom of holding carnivals for Mardi Gras has continued since the Middle Ages.  The carnivals, with spectacular parades, masked balls, mock ceremonials, and street dancing, usually last for a week or more before Mardi Gras itself.  Some of the most celebrated are held in New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro, Nice, and Cologne.  Fat Tuesday... my kind of holiday!  I've ordered the new headlamp assemblies for my car.  They're being shipped from California via UPS Ground.  They should be in transit for four days, so with any luck, they'll arrive on my birthday (Friday).  I've also listed the troublesome HID kit on eBay, but I  did  figure out why the lights won't work on "high."  I talked to a few people that own Honda Civics, and they said that I'd have to wire a diode into the wire harness for the headlamps because the car changes its electrical polarity when the high beams are switched on.  *groan*  My new plan will be a bit more expensive in the long run, but it will be easier to work with.  We'll see....  Last night, I had to put some fuel in the bus that I was driving.  It hadn't been refueled during the night before because the last driver left it in Framingham overnight.  (He lives in Framingham, so it's easier for him to leave it in Framingham on Sunday night so that he can come directly to the bus terminal on Monday morning.)  The fuel gauge read around a 1/4 tank of fuel, but I questioned the accuracy of the gauge, and I still had about 75 miles of driving to do between Framingham, the airport, and our garage in Millbury.  Theoretically, I should have been able to make it.  The buses hold 182 gallons of diesel fuel, and they average around 6 miles per gallon.  But I added $30 of diesel fuel (16 gallons), just in case.  And my boss just called to bitch me out!  "It's not a huge deal, but you should have checked with me first," he said.  Well, if it's not a huge deal, why are you yelling at me?!  Unreal.  Tonight, I'm supposed to visit Jesy to "watch horror movies," she said.  But I'm not sure that I'm going to be able to make it.  I ate some french onion dip last night after work, and I later realized that it had expired several days ago.  It tasted fine, but it's not sitting well (if you know what I mean).  Ugh!  Well, I best be off.  I'm going to dig up some lunch, and then I have to finish up some laundry so that I can leave later if I feel any better.  Have a good day!

      Well, my HID headlamp kit arrived.  And it will soon be leaving just as quickly as it came!  My brothers and I have tried  everything  to get the kit to work properly.  Alas, our efforts have been futile.  First of all, the HID lights work on low, but the car changes its electrical polarity when the high beams are switched on, causing the HID high beams to fail (and shut off).  Second, my car's reflector headlamp housings weren't designed for use with an HID system, so they don't reflect the HID light beam properly.  So, for two days, I've been driving around with half-ass low beams that are driving me crazy!  *grumble*  I'd really been looking forward to this addition to my car, but my plans have not been lost.  I've decided to resell the HID kit on eBay, hoping to get what I paid for it.  Then I'm going to buy new projector headlamp housings with  separate  high and low beams.  (My car currently has high and low beams in the same bulb.)  It'll require a wire harness or something to convert the wiring, but then I'll be able to get a better HID kit for the low beams in the projector lamps, and still use super-white halogen bulbs for the high beams.  (That's how most car manufacturers set the system up.)  So, it'll take some time, but it'll give my car a unique look, and in the end, it'll have bee a lot easier too.  My back is still pretty sore.  I don't know what I did, but it wasn't good!  I suppose it's nothing that a few Advil and a good night's sleep can't handle.  *grin*  And on that note, realizing the time, I bid thee a good night.

      My HID headlamp kit arrived on Thursday.  I was so excited!  Stephen, my brother, installed it when he came home from work, and later called my cell phone... to give me the bad news.  The lights work perfectly on low, but the high beams don't work for some reason.  There are several possible causes: changing polarity, faulty ballasts, incorrect bulb configuration, etc.  The manufacturer of the kit suggested a few things that I could try to correct the problem.  If their suggestions don't work, I'll have to have a professional install the kit (for an added fee, of course).  Why can't anything be easy?!  The lights look great though, and the beam pattern is exactly where it should be.  So, visibility should be better, and passing inspection shouldn't be a problem.  I'm hoping to fool around with the lights again later today, but we'll see.  I've pulled something in my back again, and it's been aching pretty badly for a few days.  I asked my boss to cover today's shift for me, and while he was completely pissed off, he found someone to do it.  I need to get some bed rest for a day, as I haven't had a day off for weeks.  (It wouldn't be so bad if I weren't lifting industrial-grade luggage all day!)  A guy actually complained that his luggage got dirty while it was being transported in the luggage bays under the bus.  Dirty!  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  So, as you can see, part of my reason for taking the day off was to avoid a burnout.  Anyway, I should go to sleep for the "night."

      Lately, I've felt as though I've needed to change.  I've needed to change lots of things, even myself.  As you can see, I've changed the look of my online journal.  (What do you think?)  If you've seen me at all lately, you might have noticed that I've lost a bit of weight, although I have a lot more to lose, and I've started growing a goatee.  (Again, what do you think?)  Personally, I think I'll like the look of the goatee once it fills in, and I've been wanting to lose weight for a long time.  But I'm curious about other people's thoughts and opinions.  My car's HID headlamp kit should be arriving today, or maybe tomorrow.  I'm slightly nervous that it won't be a good addition for my car, but time will tell.  There are a lot of variables, such as a poor beam pattern, space constraints, color, functionality, etc.  Like I said, time will tell.  I hope it works though.  I've always liked the look of HID lights, but they're a very expensive option that is only available in expensive foreign luxury cars, like Audi, Lexus, Mercedes, BMW, etc.  There are just 8 more days until my birthday!  (That's February 27... hint, hint!)  On the 28th, my parents are taking my brothers and I to see Blue Man Group at the Charles Playhouse Theater in Boston.  It should be a lot of fun!  And then, on March 7, I'm going to see Roseanne Barr at the Calvin Theater in Northampton.  It's going to be a great time!  Well, anyway, I best be off.  Bye!

      Do you receive a lot of "spam," or other unwanted e-mail?  I'd like to recommend a free program, called MailWasher, that allows you to bounce unwanted e-mail messages back to their senders.  The bounced messages state that your e-mail address is invalid, and theoretically, that will cause the senders to eventually remove you from their mailing lists.  (And even if they don't, it's nice to know that you're giving them a small taste of their own medicine!)  Once you've built up the program's "blacklist," you can have it delete and bounce unwanted messages automatically, so you'll be left only with the messages that you  want  to read.  If you'd like, you may download MailWasher by visiting this link:  urlLink www.mailwasher.net .  I've installed a new guest book system in my web site.  (The last system was e-mail based, and a lot of people prefer not to share their e-mail address.)  This new system will asks for your e-mail address, but it is not posted in the guest book, and it is not shared with anyone (including me).  So, post away!  (And by the way, Keithius helped with this too!  He designed and personalized it for me, actually.)  Keithius, I owe you!  Today, I've been assigned to a charter for the Men's and Women's Basketball Teams of Nichols College.  I'll be leaving shortly, as a matter of fact.  This is my first charter trip, but I'm pretty familiar with the area, and the passengers should be around my age too, so it'll be fun.  Plus, I'll be driving one of the bus company's cool German buses!  I won the auction that I'd been bidding on at eBay.  My HID headlamps should be here by the end of the week, and if I have time, I'll install them (with my brother's help) over the weekend.  I can't wait!  Valentine's Day wasn't so bad, I guess.  Keithius came for a ride into the airport with me while I was at work.  I think he was a little bored, but it was fun to have him along, anyway.  Jennie randomly called me the other day, babbling at my voice mail and inviting me for coffee or something.  I wasn't able to go, but it was nice to hear from her anyway.  We hadn't left things on the best of notes before, and we haven't talked at all since then.  But anyway, I invited her, Jim, and Joey out for coffee tonight.  (They all live in Webster, and I'll be going right by there with the bus tonight after my charter trip.)  It'll just be a quick get-together, and then I'll have to be on my way.  Speaking of which, I have to run!!

        Fuck Valentine's Day    (As quoted by Keithius Survellus)   Hearts and roses and kisses galore... What the hell is all that shit for? People get mushy and start acting queer It is definitely the most annoying day of the year This day needs to get the hell over with and pass Before I shove a dozen roses up Cupid's ass I'll spend the day so drunk I can't speak And wear all black for the rest of the week Guys act all sweet, but soon it will fade For all they are doing is trying to get laid The arrow Cupid shot at me must not have hit Because I think love is a crock of shit So here's my story... what else can I say? Love bites my ass...  Fuck Valentine's Day!   Happy Valentine's Day to all!

      Whew!!  February is going to be a  long  month.  Between now and the end of the month, I will have just three days off: the 24th, 27th, and 28th.  And the 24th could be questionable too.  I'm preparing to move into an apartment of my own in a few months, so I asked for some extra time at work.  (As if my existing 50-hour schedule isn't enough....)  They certainly gave it to me!  I didn't expect to have any other plans, so I volunteered to fill in for another driver on Saturday evening.  On Tuesday, I'll be doing a local charter run for the men's and women's basketball teams of Nichols College.  Then, my next "day off" will be spent at work, filling in again.  Whew!!  I looked at the calendar today, and I noted that Valentine's Day -- my most hated "holiday" of the year -- is less than 36 hours away.  Hmm....  Well, I guess I'll be celebrating my Valentine's Day with the guys at work.  Maybe I'll be able to make the evening more exciting by running down pedestrians in Copley Square, or maybe pushing taxi cabs off of the airport roadway.  Oh, the possibilities....  Last night, at Logan Airport, I spotted a car fire in a construction area near the new Terminal A.  There was no sign of any emergency response vehicles on the way, so I stopped at a road construction area to tell a state trooper.  I parked the bus behind the cruiser, and the female officer jumped out of her vehicle, rudely yelling, "What?!"  I was so taken back by her obnoxiousness that I let my mouth take off.  "Well, officer, I'm sure that you must be awfully tired from monitoring this construction site from your cruiser, and I hate to disturb your very diligent work, but there's a car fire or something going on in the construction area by Terminal A."  She just plopped back into her cruiser without so much as a word, and closed the door.  So, I got back in the bus and drove away, tooting the air horn on my way by the cruiser, setting off the K-9 in the back seat.  *snicker*  It was all too perfect!  (I'm just glad that she didn't give me any trouble for responding to her attitude with one of my own!)  Since I bought my new car in June, I've wanted to buy a Xenon HID headlamp upgrade kit.  The HID headlamps are pretty expensive, but they're the bright bluish-white ones that you see on a lot of new foreign luxury cars now, like Audi, Mercedes, Acura, and BMW.  The bluish-white light that they produce reflects off of signs and street markings better, making it easier to see at night and in poor weather.  They also use less energy, which means that my car will consume a tiny bit less fuel too.  Anyway, I found a nice kit on eBay that I bid on.  It  should  be compatible with my car, and if everything turns out to be exactly what the seller described, then installation should take about an hour or so.  My brother, Steve, said he'd do that for me.  Then, I'll have nice, sleek looking headlamps that help me to see better!  (Oh, the concept....)  The auction still has about 30 hours left to go, but for the last 4 days or so, I've been the high bidder at $380.  Typically, this upgrade kit costs about $600.  The seller had bought this kit last year (for $600) for his Honda Civic, but he traded the Civic for something else.  So, he never installed this kit.  Supposedly, it's brand new and has never been used.  It's even still covered by the manufacturer's 5-year warranty from Osram/Sylvania.  And it comes  with  the bulbs, which can cost up to $275 alone!  (But the bulbs are guaranteed to last for the lifetime of the car.)  ...pretty cool, huh?  Since the middle of January, someone has been calling our house and hanging up as soon as we answer the phone.  At the end of January, I took the number from the caller ID, and called it to find out who it was.  The number is in Illinois, and the company is Verizon.  I spoke with a customer service representative, and asked her to place our numbers on their "Do Not Contact" list, as we're tired of the hang-up phone calls.  Well, the hang-up calls have continued -- almost daily -- even though we're listed on the state  and  national "Do Not Contact" registries,  and  Verizon has been asked not to call any longer.  So, my parents are planning to press charges.  We've been recording the date and time of each hang-up call that comes from Verizon, and my Mom said that they're going to pursue this next week because Verizon is violating the law.  ...not to mention our privacy...  Well, anyway, I best be off.  I have to get ready to go to work -- my home away from home.  Have a great day!

        Robber uses bomb threat, flees with cash  Millbury closes downtown area for hours after bank heist    Millbury  -- Police evacuated businesses and closed off part of downtown for several hours yesterday after a robber threatened to bomb the Millbury Savings Bank on Elm Street.  The robber walked into the bank about 1:30 p.m. and handed the teller a note in which he demanded cash, according to Police Sgt. Mark Moore.  The note also threatened the use of an explosive if the teller did not hand over the money, he said.  The robber left the bank and drove away in a blue sport utility vehicle with an undisclosed amount of cash, Sgt. Moore said.  A bank employee then called police, whose headquarters are less than a mile from the bank.  The robber was described as white, 5 feet 8 inches tall and slender.  Witnesses told police he was wearing a black or dark-colored jacket with white lettering, a baseball cap and sunglasses.  Sgt. Moore said it appeared that the robber acted alone.  A package was left behind, which the state police bomb squad eventually determined contained no explosives, Sgt. Moore said.  A member of the bomb squad, wearing an armored bomb suit, examined the package.  While the investigation was going on, Millbury police closed a small section of Elm Street to traffic for several hours, evacuated surrounding businesses and cordoned off a few blocks.  The bank is in the center of town, along with other banks, restaurants, a post office, and the historic Asa Waters Mansion.  No one was injured, Sgt. Moore said.  He said he was unsure how many customers were in the bank at the time.  Along with the Millbury Police and Fire departments, the state police, the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and the Shrewsbury Police Department's crime scene services unit were at the bank after the robbery.  Sgt. Moore said anyone with any information about the robbery should call Millbury Detective John Hanlon at 508-865-3521.   By Steven H. Foskett Jr. Telegram & Gazette Staff

      My plans to share an apartment with my brother have been squashed.  Twice, now, I've volunteered to share an apartment with someone.  And twice, the plans have been squashed for one reason or another.  So, I've decided: this is a sign.  It's a sign that I have to do this by myself.  In the words of Whitney Houston, "I am not afraid to try it on my own.  And I don't care if I'm right or wrong.  I'll live my life the way I feel.  No matter what, I'll keep it real.  You know, it's time for me to do it on my own."

      I have another bit of good news!  I might be getting my own place sooner than later!  Actually, I'd be sharing it with my younger brother, Steve, because he's seeking to get his own place too.  So, tomorrow, we're going to look at a 3-bedroom apartment in the village of Rockdale (on School Street in Northbridge).  It's near the old Curtain Factory and St. Peter's Church, where I used to play the organ each week.  Anyway, it's a 3-bedroom apartment that comes with wall-to-wall carpeting, all of the necessary appliances -- including our own private washer and dryer -- for $800 per month.  My brother and I would be splitting the rent to make it more affordable for both of us.  So, I wouldn't be paying much more for anything than I am now, and I'd still be saving a reasonable amount each month too, unlike the last time I moved into an apartment!  And if we decide to rent this place, we'll each have our own bedroom -- plus an extra one to use as an office, a den, or a guest's room.  It'd take us a little while to furnish the place, but with time, it'd happen.  So, after we've looked at it, I'll let you know what we think, and I'll post some pictures of the place too!

      Another week is gone.  (Can you believe it?!)  And a lot has happened in the last seven days!  The biggest --  and best  -- news, of course, is that two of my best friends are now engaged to be married!  (Everyone knew that it would happen someday.)  Congratulations, Joey and Jim!  Joey's been one of my closest friends since high school.  She's a great person; she's one of the only people who have always been there for me.  Through Joey, I met her fiance, Jim.  He's a great guy who always tells it like it is.  Together, they are an excellent team and couple.  I wish all of the best for them and they look ahead into their lives together!  I'm also proud and excited to note that I've  almost  completely recovered from the terrible financial hardship that has haunted me since September 11, 2001.  Next month, I will be paying off the remainder of a debt that once neared $10,000!  This accomplishment has taken years of time, countless sacrifices, careful budgeting, and an immeasurable amount of time at work.  But  I did it , and words can't express how relieved I am to see that my financial stability is drastically improving.  The extra savings each month will be used to quickly replenish my savings so that I can take another step toward independence: finding my own place to live.  My friends, Mandy and Jake, are moving into a 2-bedroom townhouse in Northbridge.  I was supposed to help them move again, but time and circumstances will not allow it.  Laura contacted an employment agency, and they've assigned her to a temporary position at TJX Company in Framingham, serving as an Assistant Merchandising Manager.  Jen has been applying for new teaching positions in the Phoenix, AZ area, as well as some in Massachusetts.  Jesy, Marcia, Kayla, Keith, Paul, Christine, Kim, Mary Ann, Rich, Haris, Mohamed, Nusret, and Ed are all doing well.  Sara will be performing in several performances of "The Pirates of Penzance" with the Sudbury Savoyards.  I'm hoping to see the performance on my birthday, the 27th.  I haven't heard much from Mark, Jennie, Deb, Frankie, or Jon.  (What's up with that, guys?!)  *grin*  And so, I guess that's about it.  (I guess there wasn't as much to report as I initially thought!)  But nonetheless, it's exciting stuff.  Be well; talk soon!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Tired.  LISTENING TO:   The furnace.  Well, I have a quick update about my car's "Check Engine" light.  I sat at the dealer for more than an hour while the technicians scanned my car's computer for trouble codes this afternoon.  They determined that an oxygen sensor was reporting a fuel mixture that was too lean.  So, they stock ordered the part, and it'll arrive in about a week.  (My first thought was, "A major Honda dealer, like Lundgren Honda, doesn't keep something as simple as an oxygen sensor in stock for repairs?")  Anyway, they said that the car is safe to drive in the meantime.  Then, when the new part comes in, I'll have to go  back  to the dealer and sit for  another  hour (or more) while they install the new part (which --  thankfully  -- is covered under the original warranty).  I just hope that this is a simple defect, and not a small sign of bigger problems yet to come.  I've tried to be quiet.  But I can't hold this stuff in anymore.  If you live in Massachusetts, you may have heard about the major accident that occurred on the turnpike in Auburn the other day.  The accident involved four vehicles, including a state trooper.  Two of the victims were severely injured, one of them was the state trooper, but none of the injuries was life-threatening.  Witnesses reported that the state trooper was the second in a convoy of several troopers who were returning from a training session in the western part of the state.  The first cruiser swerved to avoid a disabled vehicle that had stopped in the passing lane, but the second cruiser slammed right into the back of the disabled vehicle.  Note: I correctly called it the "passing lane" -- not a "fast" or "high-speed" lane.  The right and middle lanes of a 3-lane highway are travel lanes.  The left lane is a passing lane, and it is to be used  only  for passing a vehicle in the middle lane -- not for extended travel.  And the speed limit across all three lanes is still 65 miles per hour, so calling it a "fast" or "high-speed" lane is incorrect.  However, the state police apparently disagree (and blatantly disobey) these facts even though they hypocritically enforce them.  Frequently, state troopers travel in the left lane well in excess of the speed limit.  They tailgate and bully other motorists until they move out of the way so that they can continue at dangerously high rates of speed.  I would be willing to bet that these troopers were driving too fast and too close together in their convoy.  When the first cruiser swerved to avoid the disabled vehicle in the left lane, the second cruiser was unable to react because he had failed to maintain a safe following distance for the excessive speed at which he was traveling.  (I wouldn't be surprised if he was using a cell phone when the accident occurred either.)  The fact is: I'm angry.  My tax dollars -- and if you live in Massachusetts, yours too -- paid for the cruiser that was destroyed in this potentially avoidable accident.  Not a cheap loss.  These troopers should obey the traffic laws and regulations that they enforce, just like everyone else (including me).  Only if they are enroute to an emergency should they be exempt from the speed limit, and safe driving practices should  still  prevail.  Governor Romney has finally earned an ounce of my respect through his latest motions in the matter of same-sex marriage.  As long as I can remember, there has been a separation of church and state.  Marriage is a holy and sacred sacrament of the church that specifically unites a man and woman in holy matrimony.  I have absolutely nothing against lesbians, or people who are gay or bi-sexual.  However, I  do  think that the separation of church and state should be upheld.  Let the church define the meaning of marriage.  Let the church decide who it will marry in the eyes of the church and religion.  Civil unions  should  be made available to members of same-sex couples who would like to be united in the eyes of the state to access various benefits for their spouses and families.  And to the idiot California lawyer who is fighting to remove the words "under God" from the Pledge of Allegiance so that his daughter wouldn't be unwillingly subjected to religious beliefs, grow up!!  I bet he didn't have any trouble collecting his clients' money -- which had "In God We Trust" written on every piece.  (By the way, this lawyer is divorced from his wife.  His wife has full custody of their daughter, and the daughter has been raised in the Christian faith since day one.)  Get a life!  Onto a brighter topic.  I may be coordinating a fund-raiser event for St. Jude Children's Hospital at the end of may, or early June.  I've been talking with someone at St. Jude, and they are going to send me information about the event.  It'd be a walk-a-thon or a bike-a-thon, for which I would be responsible.  St. Jude Children's Hospital does great things for children who have cancer and other serious ailments.  I used to participate in the local bike-a-thon every year, but since my bike broke (and I gained weight), I haven't done anything to help them.  This would be a good opportunity to get involved again.  So, look for more information about that, and of course, I'll expect all of  you  to be there when it happens!  *grin*

       CURRENT MOOD:   Irked.  LISTENING TO:   "Cheers" on Nick@Nite.  Last week, I brought my car to the dealer for its 10,000-mile recommended service and oil change.  Everything checked out perfectly, but less than three hours after I left the dealer, my car's "Check Engine" light turned on.  Knowing that I'd just come from the dealer -- and the fact that my car has traveled only 9,650 miles -- I naturally asked, "WTF?!"  I called Lundgren Honda to find out what they could do.  They said that the gas cap probably hadn't been tightened properly, and they instructed me to remove the gas cap, then tighten it until it clicked at least three times.  Then they noted that the "Check Engine" light would stay on until the car's computer had tested all of the sensors three to four times without any problems.  Well, eventually the light turned off.  Today, though, it came back on again.  And the gas cap hasn't been touched.  So, my car is going back to the dealer tomorrow for some diagnostic tests, and possibly a warranty repair.  A brand new freakin' car, and the "Check Engine" light is on!  *grumble*  Traffic was absolutely terrible tonight!  The Turnpike Authority is reconstructing the median between Weston and Allston, so they've reduced the width of the lanes on each side of the highway.  The lanes were tight before, but now, they're barely wide enough to fit buses and trucks -- especially if they're trying to pass each other!  Anyway, there was a major accident on the turnpike (westbound) under the Star Market (during rush hour, of course).  I ended up getting off the turnpike in Newton Corner and navigating the side streets of Watertown, Newton, Weston, Wayland, and Natick to avoid the traffic jams (and remain on schedule).  The people on my bus were pleased, and complimented my ability.  The tips weren't bad either!  *grin*  Working for the bus company has taught me so many alternative routes in and out of the city of Boston.  ...pretty handy knowledge, if you ask me...  Someone told me a couple of pretty tasteless jokes today, but they're hilarious:   How do you know when your girlfriend's overweight?  When she sits on your face, and you can't hear the stereo.   And the other one:   You know, I used to date a homeless girl when I was younger.  What was nice about that was I could drop her off anywhere afterward.   Charter Communications sucks!!  I'm always up late at night (usually until 3 or 4 a.m.) because of my work schedule.  Charter Communications always shuts down their pipeline internet service at night for "scheduled maintenance."  It happens pretty frequently, but they always argue with me when I call (and wait on hold for 15+ minutes) to bitch.  They always say that maintenance occurs once a month or less.  Well, it's happened twice since the weekend now, and I'm pissed!  Even though they specifically call it "planned" or "scheduled" maintenance, they never notify their customers about any upcoming service outages.  And the service is unavailable for four to six hours at a time!  (Needless to say, we still pay for the service, despite the down time.)  I just find it hard to believe that they can't send a mass e-mail to their internet subscribers, informing them of an upcoming service outage due to scheduled maintenance.  (And, by the way, what the hell requires five hours of maintenance twice in four days throughout the entire state of Massachusetts?!)  It's ridiculous!  They suck, and if it were my choice, I'd take my business elsewhere.  I never had this problem with MediaOne or AT&T Broadband.  Anyway, I should get going.  I have to be able to get up in the morning to take my car to the dealer... again.  Before I go, though, I'd like to thank those of you who wrote to tell me that you read my blog, etc.  Actually, I was surprised by the number of people who sent me e-mail or instant messages.  Thanks, and I'm glad to know that my time isn't wasted while writing in this blog.  Cheers, and good night!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Disappointed.  LISTENING TO:   The furnace.  I think I've decided that no one reads this blog anymore.  I know I'm certainly not the most exciting person on the face of the earth, but no one ever posts their comments anymore.  With the exception of Keithius, no one has signed the guest book on my web site.  Actually, I even know of one person who matter-of-factly told me recently that she "never looks at it."  Well, thanks!  I guess this has turned out to be just another example of how people run to me with their problems, but when I try to share something from my own life, everyone disappears.  Ugh.

       CURRENT MOOD:   Pleasant.  LISTENING TO:   The furnace.  Believe it or not, I really don't have much to report -- despite the fact that I haven't updated this blog for a week.  (I guess that's a good thing!)  Give me a minute though; I'll come up with  something .  I just got back from Lundgren Honda (Rte. 20, Auburn).  Zippy, my car, had an appointment for its 10,000-mile service today.  They changed the oil, performed a 4-wheel alignment, inspected the brakes, rotated the tires, inspected the steering and suspension, inspected the belts and hoses, inspected the fuel and exhaust systems, etc.  Everything checked out perfectly.  So, that's all Zippy will need for another 5 months or 5,000 miles.  After I left the dealer, I took the car for a spin down Rte. 395 to Oxford, where I stopped at Ernie's Touch-Free Car Wash.  Now Zippy's nice and clean too!  In a few weeks, Zippy will be getting new headlamps.  In several previous entries, I probably mentioned that I'd been wanting to convert my headlamps to those bluish ones that the expensive foreign luxury cars have.  (It's called high-intensity discharge, or HID, lighting.)  I even bought a kit that I installed, but it didn't work properly.  The stock headlamps weren't designed for HID lighting, so while the lights were brighter, they just didn't disperse the light properly.  But....  I found a shop in New York City that will retrofit my new headlamps with special projector lenses that were designed for HID lighting.  It's going to be pretty expensive, but it'll be done properly.  And in actuality, the job won't cost me that much because I'll be using my tips from work and rolled spare change to pay for a lot of it.  So, I'll only be using a small amount of my savings.  Did I tell you that I've paid off one of my largest debts?!  When I moved into the apartment complex in Clinton with Keithius, my existing financial problems were launched through the roof when I lost my job.  And the entire situation was  compounded by the auto accident that totaled my Buick.  (Oops....)  My parents loaned me many several thousand dollars to buy replacement transportation, as well as to pay bills, rent, etc.  As soon as I was settled in my job at the bus company, I began making sizable regular payments to return the money that my parents had so generously allowed me to borrow.  (I also bought a brand new car to get rid of the headaches that my "replacement transportation" was causing so often.  Thus, Zippy entered the picture.)  Well, last week, I paid off the  entire  remaining balance of the personal loan in a lump sum!  It's taken years of hard work and countless sacrifices to emerge from debt without filing for bankruptcy or damaging my credit too badly.  And I can't forget to thank my parents.  But the fact remains: I'm doing it!  I'm finally starting to see tangible results, and I've just conquered one of the largest hurdles.  I'm so excited (and relieved)!  I'll be trying to invest some extra time at work so that I can build a nice financial cushion for myself, and then by September, I'm hoping to be in my own cozy apartment.  And  this  time, I'll be able to handle it!  And so, I guess that's about it!  Be well, enjoy the nice weather, and keep in touch!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Amused.  LISTENING TO:   Bad commercials on TV.  So, it's the middle of March, practically just days away from the first day of spring, and weather forecasters are expecting six to twelve inches of snow to fall across the region throughout tonight and tomorrow morning.  I thought spring was supposed to bring warmer weather....  Well, anyway, it'll be fun to watch the snow fall again.  We've had a pretty dry winter overall.  I finally tried those cigars that I'd been looking for.  They're the honey berry variety by Backwoods.  They smell nice before you light them, but I couldn't deal with the taste of the smoke.  I used to enjoy a good cigar once in a while, but it's been years since I've smoked one.  I guess I've lost interest, which is probably just as well.  They're not good for me anyway.  On Charter Communications' inDemand gaming channel, I've been playing video poker a lot.  If I remember correctly, the game starts with a bank of $5,000.  I've been playing off and on for about two weeks, and I've boosted that bank to over $350,000 at just $250 per bet!  Now, if only it were real money....  Alas, it's just for fun.  I've been thinking of enrolling in my employer's 401(K) profit sharing/retirement plan.  It's the best way for me to save for my retirement, and I'm young enough to ride out the fluctuations of an aggressive approach to high-growth investments.  I'm going to wait until the company's next enrollment period in July though.  I've been preparing (financially) to move into an apartment over the summer, so I can use the extra income right now, rather than deducting it from my pay for the 401(K) plan.  The best thing happened yesterday!  I paid the entire remaining balance of the personal loan that my parents gave me to help me through the rough times in my old apartment.  I'd lost my job, fell behind in all of my bills, and then totaled my car.  My parents loaned me a lot of money to help me get through, and I agreed to repay every cent.  And I have!  I'm done!  I'm free!  I can start saving money again!  I'm so relieved -- and most of all, I'm proud to know that I've worked so hard to correct my financial standing.  I could have taken the "easy" way out by filing for bankruptcy, but that haunts people for many years afterward.  I chose to make lots of sacrifices, work like a dog, and come out on top in the end.

       CURRENT MOOD:   Bitter.  LISTENING TO:   The furnace.   NEWS FLASH:   I will  not  be going to Atlantic City after all.  My boss called again today (and woke me up -- again) to tell me that another charter group had changed the date of their trip, so a full-time charter driver would be available to cover my Atlantic City trip.  Because I'm not a charter driver, they have to give the work to the charter drivers first  I'd really been looking forward to this trip too.  This happens  every time  I get my heart set on something.  It doesn't matter whether it's a planned event, a person, a thing -- anything.  The carpet gets yanked out from under me every time, and I'm left in bitter disappointment.  Last week, it was the Roseanne Barr performance and the crappy hotel in Nashua.  Now this.  I'm pissed!  I called the theater in Northampton to find out where the missing $11 went.  They said it's their $5.50-per-ticket "nonrefundable processing and handling fee."  People will call it anything they can if it means they'll be able to keep the cash.  Hrmph!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Tired.  LISTENING TO:   "Full House" on Nick@Nite.  Last weekend, I was supposed to see Roseanne Barr perform at the Calvin Theater in Northampton, MA.  Sadly, the show was canceled for one reason or another.  (The theater issued a refund, but they cheated me out of $11.  Time to bitch!)  So, anyway, instead of going to see Roseanne, I reserved a hotel room at the Holiday Inn in Nashua, NH.  What a dump!!  I was extremely unhappy with the quality of the room and service, considering the amount of money that I spent to reserve the room.  I didn't get much sleep there, which didn't help the situation.  But overall, it was a decent time.  Today, my bossed called and woke me up.  He said, "Pack your bags, I've got a job for you!"  As it turns out, he was calling to assign me to a 3-day charter trip to the casinos in Atlantic City, NJ.  They only give these trips to the senior charter drivers because they pay so well (around $500 for about 17 hours of actual work).  ...which makes me wonder why they gave it to me...  I've never been there, so it'll be fun.  Basically, it's an all-expenses-paid 3-day trip to Atlantic City.  I have to pick up a group of about 50 people in Lynn, MA at the ass crack of dawn on Sunday.  Then we'll stop in Hartford, CT for breakfast before we continue to New Jersey.  I drop the group off at the casino, then I go to my hotel.  And that's it!  I'll have the next day off at the hotel, and then on Tuesday afternoon, I'll pick the group up at the casino again.  We stop once for a sit-down dinner on our way home, and then I drop them off in Lynn again.  It should be good!  I might go try my hand at a round of blackjack or video poker.  *grin*  It'll be nice to have two nights to myself in a top-notch hotel without having to pay a cent for anything, even meals!  Sweet....  Anyway, I have to go to bed.  It's almost 6 a.m., and I haven't been to bed yet!!  (Eep!)  Caffeine high.  Good night!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Tranquil.  LISTENING TO:   FOX25 News.  Like Keithius, I'm very interested in self-analysis and personality types.  My astrological sign is "Pisces," as my birthday falls on February 27.  This detailed description of the "average" Pisces is shockingly accurate, but I've added my own commentary  [italicized in brackets] :   Pisceans possess a gentle, patient, malleable nature. They have many generous qualities and are friendly, good natured, kind and compassionate, sensitive to the feelings of those around them, and respond with the utmost sympathy and tact to any suffering they encounter. They are deservedly popular with all kinds of people, partly because their easygoing, affectionate, submissive natures offer no threat or challenge to stronger and more exuberant characters. They accept the people around them and the circumstances in which they find themselves rather than trying to adapt them to suit themselves, and they patiently wait for problems to sort themselves out rather than take the initiative in solving them. They are more readily concerned with the problems of others than with their own.  [Although I have many frustrations and problems in my own life too, people -- even complete strangers -- have felt instantly comfortable enough to approach me and talk about things that may be bothering them!]   Their natures tend to be too otherworldly for the practical purposes of living in this world as it is. They sometimes exist emotionally rather than rationally, instinctively more than intellectually (depending on how they are aspected). They long to be recognized as greatly creative.  [Ta-da!]  They also dislike disciple and confinement. The nine-to-five life is not for them.  [Yeah, five-to-two is better for me.]  Any rebellion they make against convention is personal, however, as they often times do not have the energy or motivation to battle against the Establishment.  Pisceans tend to withdraw into a dream world where their qualities can bring mental satisfaction and sometimes, fame and financial reward for they are extremely gifted artistically. They are also versatile and intuitive, have quick understanding, observe and listen well, and are receptive to new ideas and atmospheres. All these factors can combine to produce remarkable creativity in literature, music and art.  [I always knew that music was my calling!]  They may count among their gifts mediumistic qualities which can give them a feeling that their best work comes from outside themselves, "Whispered beyond the misted curtains, screening this world from that." Even when they cannot express themselves creatively they have a greater than average instinct for, and love of, beauty in art and nature, a catlike appreciation of luxury and pleasure, and a yearning for new sensations and travel to remote, exotic places.  They are never egotistical in their personal relationships and give more than they ask from their friends. They are sexually delicate, in the extreme almost asexual, and most Pisceans would want a relationship in which the partner's mind and spirit rather than the body resonated with their own.  [Yes!]  Unfortunately they can be easily misled by a lover who courts them delicately and in marriage makes them unhappy by a coarser sexuality than they expected. They are nevertheless intensely loyal and home-loving and will remain faithful.  In their employment they are better working either by themselves or in subordinate positions. Their talents are individual in a commercial business or similar undertaking. They would be afraid to manage more than a small department, worrying always that they would fail in a crisis. They can make fair secretaries and bookkeepers  [and bus drivers too, minus the speeding tickets] . Their sympathy equips them for work in charities catering for the needy, as nurses looking after the sick and as veterinary surgeons caring for animals. As librarians or astronomers they can satisfy their mental wanderlust, and their fondness for "faraway places with strange-sounding names" may turn them into sailors or travelers. Many architects and lawyers are Pisceans, and when the creative abilities are combined with gifts of imitation and the ability to enter into the feelings of others, Pisceans find their fulfillment on the stage.  [Again, ta-da!]  Their psychic and spiritual qualities can lead them into careers in the church or as mediums and mystics. They may find an outlet for their creativity as caterers, and are said to make good detectives because they can imagine themselves in the place of criminals and understand how their minds would work.  [I've considered this too.]  In technical occupations they are well employed in dealing with anesthetics, fluids, gases and plastics. Because of their lively versatility and inability to concentrate overmuch on any one project, Pisceans often simultaneously follow more than one occupation.  ["All that is gold does not glitter, not all those who wander are lost."]   If you want to read more about my astrological sign,  urlLink click here !  And by the way, some other people who share my birthdate are Joan Bennett, Joanne Woodward, Elizabeth Taylor, Chelsea Clinton, and Ralph Nader.  *grin*

       CURRENT MOOD:   Livid.  LISTENING TO:   The furnace.  I can't wait to move into my own place!  Seriously, since I moved back into my parents' house in May 2002, I haven't slept for more than five hours each night.  No one, except maybe my mother, respects the fact that my work schedule puts me on a completely different schedule from everyone else.  I don't get home from work until 2 a.m., so I'm usually awake until at least 4 a.m.  Then, I  try  to sleep until noon or so.  But even though my "bedroom" is in the cold and dank basement, my efforts to get a full "night's" sleep are usually thwarted by any number of things: slamming doors, unnecessarily loud conversations, heavy footed family members stomping across the floor overhead, the barking half-dog, invasive early-morning telephone calls, landscaping work outside, even noisy car repairs in the garage.  Weekend or not, the fact that I might have to go to work the next day (to drive the second largest and heaviest vehicle on the road while taking up to 51+ people's lives into my responsibility at any one time) means nothing to anyone around here.  Whether I have the next day off or not, I'm expected to operate at full throttle with five or less hours of sleep.  Basically, if I want a full night's sleep, I have to dish out $75+ to spend the night at a hotel or motel (as I'm doing tonight).  So, therefore, on my own two hands, I can count the number of full nights of sleep that I've actually gotten since I moved back into my parents' house in May 2002!  And all of this whining leads me to my next complaint.  Why do "outages due to scheduled maintenance" occur so often?  Almost nightly, when I come home from work, I cannot access the cable internet because Charter Communications has interrupted the service so that they can dick around with things.  When I can access the internet, everything else is unavailable "due to scheduled maintenance."  I don't recall any kind of refund on the last cable invoice for these outages, which sometimes last the entire night, nor does Charter Communications make any effort to notify their paying customers of the "scheduled" outages.  So, when I call them to bitch that my cable internet is down, I end up talking to some obnoxious customer service representative in Illinois who doesn't have a clue.  Whatever happened to the days of customer service, when a dollar actually meant something?!  In today's self-centered society, the customers means nothing, as long as they've paid their bill.  Well, a word of advice to these senselessly large corporate conglomerates: you'd be  nowhere  without your paying consumers.  And to the rude and clueless customer service representatives: you'd be out of a job if it weren't for your customers.  Show a little more appreciation and respect!  I understand that service jobs can be frustrating and tedious at times.  (I have one too.)  But as service workers,  it's our job  to be sure that the customers come first --  and  that they're completely satisfied.  So, now that I've blown off some steam, I'm going to get ready for the day, pack up some clothes, and I'm going to check into a hotel in the Nashua, NH area.  (Maybe it'll be far enough away that no one will bother me!)

       CURRENT MOOD:   Pissed.  LISTENING TO:   "Roseanne" on Nick@Nite.  Maybe you're asking, "Why is he pissed off  now ?"  Well, I have a couple of very good reasons.  How does a $180 speeding ticket and a canceled night on the town sound?  *grumbling*  The other night, while leaving the airport, I was driving the bus down the ramp toward the Ted Williams Tunnel.  As I approached the toll booth, a state trooper was motioning for me to pull over.  At first, I assumed that he wanted to inspect and/or search the bus for security purposes, but then he asked for my license and registration.  I asked him why I'd been pulled over, and he replied, "Your speed was 33 miles per hour on the ramp, sir, and the speed limit is 15."  I tried to explain that the speedometer wasn't visible because the light in the speedometer had burned out, so I'd based my speed on the traffic around me.  I asked, "So, I'm being cited for a defect that should be my employer's responsibility?  That's not fair!"  The trooper grew more annoyed and replied, "That's not my fault, sir.   You're  the one who's driving the bus.  Is it fair that your passengers are being placed in an unsafe situation?"  At this, I surrendered and gave the officer my license and registration, which were promptly returned with a $180 citation for speeding.  ...not to mention the embarrassment of having many passengers in the bus during the ordeal...  I travel that route several times each day, and I  never  once noticed the posted speed limit of 15 m.p.h. on that ramp.  Two of our other drivers said that they thought the signs were brand new.  Could I have been the victim of a little "fund raiser" of sorts?  I don't know.  In order to drive trucks or buses, you need a special license, among other permits and certifications.  It's called a commercial driver's license, or CDL.  People who have a CDL are held at a higher regard because we are professional drivers.  Thus, the consequences are  much  worse when we do something wrong.  As far as speeding is concerned, if we are cited just  twice  in any  3-year  period for driving more than 15 m.p.h. above the speed limit, our licenses will be suspended for 60 to 120 days.  (The "typical" driver can receive three or even  more  tickets in a single year, and the only consequence will be to attend a mandatory defensive driving seminar -- which, by the way, is required of us CDL holders as part of our initial training.)  Alex, I think I'll take "Court Hearings in East Boston" for $500.  On my way to work yesterday, my cell phone rang.  It was the box office at the Calvin Theater in Northampton.  The gentleman was calling to inform me that this Sunday's performance by Roseanne Barr had been canceled.  Canceled!  Without a rescheduled date!  I spent  good money  on those tickets, and I've been looking forward to the show for  weeks !  The theater is issuing a full refund, but I'm  still  going to lose time at work -- 13 and a half hours to be exact -- just about enough to cover that  freakin'  speeding ticket!  Ugh....

       CURRENT MOOD:   Relieved.  LISTENING TO:   The heater.  Surprise... I  am  still alive!  Actually, I've been very busy at work.  So, I apologize for being exceptionally neglectful.  As I mentioned in a previous entry, the harsh reality of paying bills has set in.  Unfortunately, a lot of it is panic and paranoia too -- the result of the financial hardship that sucked me under while I was in my last place more than two years ago.  I'm excited to be on my own again, but I'm very afraid that I will fail in the same way that I did last time.  So, I found a part-time job at Wireless Resource at the Natick Mall.  I tried it for a week.  ...and I quit today!  *grin*  The hours would have killed me, and I didn't particularly care for the way that they ran things there.  (Their sales tactics are very pushy and even underhanded.)  Besides, the bus company has assigned me to the wash bay every Saturday night, washing the buses and getting them ready for the next day's work.  In a single night, I'll be making more than I would have earned in an entire week at the wireless store!  Plus, it'll follow the same basic schedule that I already have.  Marble has been here for slightly more than two weeks.  She had a rough beginning -- being taken from anything and everything she's ever known.  But she's slowing adapting to her new surroundings.  Pretty soon, I'll start taking her outside so that she can get familiar with everything around the new house.  A few more weeks, and she should be ready to roam free (and she'll even know which house to come home to)!   I haven't burned any more pot holders.  But I did finally rake up the yard and the gardens out front.  Here's a photo of my little "postage stamp!"  I plan to do a few things around to neaten up more, etc.  My landlord gave me permission to make any modifications that might make me happy while I'm living here -- as long as they won't cause damage or have to be reversed after I move out.  I'm pretty happy here.  It's a good feeling to be on my own and independent again.  And it's exciting to be in my own house with the freedom to do little projects here and there as I please.  Now that my schedule is settling down, and I've gotten the place set up pretty well, keep an eye on your e-mail for an invitation to my housewarming party.  I'll probably have some type of an open-house arrangement so that people can come and go as they please.  I'll have some snacks here, and maybe I'll make dinner for those people who are here around dinner time.  We'll see.  Anyway, I best be off.  Have a good day, and I'll hope to hear from you all soon!!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Embarrassed.  LISTENING TO:   96.1FM WSRS.  So, I turn the oven on to cook some chicken nuggets for lunch.  Shortly after, the smoke detector starts to blare.  I checked on the oven; it seemed fine, though I did smell something "hot."  I pulled the battery from the smoke detector, figuring it was just extra sensitive.  A moment or two later, the detector in the living room began to scream.  At that, I returned to the kitchen to find the gas range nearly engulfed in flames.  "F***!"  I grabbed the fire extinguisher, and opened the oven.  And the cause of the fire was revealed: pot holders.  Yes, pot holders.  I'd put them in what I thought was a storage drawer under the oven.  As it turns out, it wasn't a storage drawer at all.  It was, in fact, a broiler drawer.  The pot holders were too close to the gas burner, and they ignited a blaze.  Fortunately, I extinguished the fire before it caused damage of any kind.  So, now that everything has been cleaned, no one would be able to tell that there was an incident.  It just smells a little... and still sets off the smoke detectors when the oven is on.  (Oops!)

       CURRENT MOOD:   Tranquil.  LISTENING TO:   The radiator.  The first full week in my new place was great.  The place is really starting to shape up!  I have a nice little dining room table with matching chairs, a hutch for storage and eventually a microwave, a futon and glass-top coffee table in the living room, etc.  From now on, I'll be getting little accessories to fill up the empty wall space: pictures, little shelves, etc.  (The walls are pretty bare right now!)  I've signed a renter's insurance policy that will protect my property while I'm living here in the event of theft or damage due to fire, water, or other causes.  It's  very  affordable!  If you're a tenant, you should look into it.  My policy -- a $15,000 policy with a $250 deductible -- is just $125  per year !  That's a small investment in comparison to the loss that you could take if you weren't covered by insurance.  It also covers any personal injuries that occur on your property.  So, although I'm here and loving it, reality has set in.  I need a second job.  My excise tax bill and car insurance renewals are hitting me all at once, plus I may have to pay the speeding ticket if the court doesn't rule in my favor.  (By the way, my hearing will be held on Monday, May 10 at 11 a.m.  Wish me luck!!)  So, I'm seeking a part-time job to supplement my income from the bus company.  I'm not looking for much... maybe $100 per week after taxes.  I have an interview at Ritz Camera in the Natick Mall this afternoon.  I'd been considering a paper route, which I'd handle after work each night.  But the Telegram & Gazette hasn't returned my calls, and I need to act fast.  My landlord has been  extremely  patient and flexible, waiting for the last part of my initial deposit while I fumble around with other unexpected bills.  Having a second job part-time would give me the extra income that I need to get through the tight spot(s).  Other than that, everything is great here.  This place is starting to feel like home.  And I'll be bringing Marble over this afternoon too!  Later this week, maybe Thursday or Friday when the weather dries out a bit, I'll start raking the front "yard."  Once I get the gardens neatened up, I'll buy a yard or two of quartz gravel to make a real driveway for myself beside the house... instead of the sand sinkhole that I park in now.  And later, when the weather gets warmer, I'll bleach the siding outside to get rid of the mold and mildew on the north side of the house.  I might do a bit of touch-up painting inside too.  All in all, if I can get through this challenging beginning, I think this could be my home for a number of years to come!  My car's oxygen sensor arrived last week.  I have to take my car for the warranty service on Thursday at noon.  They expect the work to take about an hour, so I'll wait for it... maybe even use the computer in the business work room for a bit.  Other than that, not much else is going on around here.  Once I've decorated the place a bit more, and my financial means are less restricted, I'll have that housewarming that I mentioned a while back.  Be well, and I'll talk to you soon!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Happy and Relaxed.  LISTENING TO:   "Judge Joe Brown" on UPN38.  Well, my first night in my new place was sensational!  It's quiet, it's peaceful, and it's mine.  My cable service (digital television and high speed internet) has been set up, and all of the other utilities (electricity and gas) have been put in my name.  I'll be using my cell phone instead of getting a house phone for a while, so I don't have to worry about that expense.  And my landlord pays the water and sewer bills.  I've changed my address with the post office and insurance companies, etc.  And right now, I'm looking into renter's insurance to cover my belongings if anything ever gets stolen or damaged here.  Pretty soon, I'll be moving Marble over here too!  So, I think this is going to be a nice little pad for myself.  Pretty soon, I'll have to go outside and rake up the yard and the gardens out front.  The daffodils and tulips are getting choked out by dead tree leaves!  Come by and visit sometime!  I'll be having a housewarming dinner or something once I've gotten settled in here.

       CURRENT MOOD:   Tired, but thrilled.  LISTENING TO:   The furnace.  Dude, I'm moving!!  On Saturday, I went to look at the place on Dorothy Pond in Millbury.  It's a little small, but it's sufficient for one person and the occasional visitor(s).  Basically, it's a one-bedroom summer cottage that's been converted for year-round use.  I didn't see any major problems when I looked at it, so I proposed a deal, and the landlord took the bait.  Actually, the landlord has been very flexible and helpful thus far.  Today, he's going to be correcting the few problems that I did find, and I'll be moving things into the house as soon as tomorrow!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Ecstatic.  LISTENING TO:   "Wings" on Nick@Nite.  Guess what?!  Guess what?!  Guess what?!  I might be moving into  my own house !!  I found a one-bedroom house that's available for rent on Dorothy Pond in Millbury.  It's within the top end of my price range.  It's a waterfront property.  It was recently remodeled from top to bottom.  It's a waterfront property.  It's local.  It's a waterfront property.  And pets are allowed!  (And it's a waterfront property!)  I'll be going to look at it later today.  If I'm still interested after I look at it in person, I'm going for it!  My parents and one of my co-workers have offered me lots of odds and ends to get me started with furniture (a glass-top coffee table, a console television, possible a nice Lazy Boy recliner, a dinner table with chairs, etc., etc.  And I've got just about everything else that I'll need to get started.  As I get settled and learn how to budget the new expenses, I'll add little extras to the place as I go along.  It's not  actually  a "waterfront" property.  *grin*  It has a nice view of the lake, and the lake is just a few hundred yards down the street, but that's good enough for me!  I'll be able to bring Marble, and I'll be able to come and go as I please without disturbing anyone with my late-night work schedule.  I'll have total privacy!  I mean, this place is everything that I could want at a price that I can afford!  Wish me luck, and I'll give you more details if the deal works out!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Tranquil.  LISTENING TO:   Sue Raney on Music Choice.  Somehow, this evening, I found the time and energy to reflect and recollect important parts of my life.  Long story made short, I've been very fortunate overall, though not without being challenged intensely at times.  And regretfully, while I did let some important things slip from my grasp, possibly never to be mine again, I gained others too.  I've experienced and accomplished many things, but my greatest goals still wait to be reached.  And for the person that I am, I thank my family and friends for their love and support.  I love all of you!  God bless....

       CURRENT MOOD:   Happy.  LISTENING TO:   News on WBZ 4.  Great news!!  My ophthalmologist found a miniscule piece of metal embedded in my left eyeball.  (Fun!)  He numbed my eye, removed the metal with a buzzing thing, gave me two prescriptions for eye drops, and sent me on my merry way, still numb.  Now that the anesthesia has worn off, my eye is virtually pain-free and I can see normally again.  I'd almost be willing to give the guy a hug and kiss!  Key word:  almost .  *grin*  Thanks, Doc!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Amused.  LISTENING TO:   "Family Matters" on ABC Family.  Check out my blog's new look!  What do you think?  I'm even using Blogger's integrated comment system, but for some reason, it won't allow readers to comment on the most recent entry.  *shrug*  I'll figure it out later.  This has been a tough week for me.  On Monday evening, while I was at the airport, I got a sudden pain in my left eye.  It felt as though a piece of sand or maybe a hair had gotten into my eye.  I flushed my eye with water, but it didn't help.  When I got back to Framingham with the bus, I flushed my eye with water again.  One of my co-workers looked into my eye with a flashlight, and he said that he couldn't see anything foreign, but he did see a little bump under my eyelid that looked almost like a pimple.  A little wierd, don't you think?  I used Visine to soothe my eyes for the next 24 hours, but when the pain hadn't gone away, I saw my doctor.  He poked and prodded.  He swabbed my eye with one of this 4-foot sterile cotton swabs.  He used dye that glowed yellow under a black light to look for scratches or any foreign materials.  He found nothing -- not even the little bump that my co-worker saw -- but he noted that my eyes were very irritated by grit from pollen and dust.  So, he gave me a prescription for Acular eye drops, which are used to relieve the symptoms of season allergic conjunctivitis.  The prescription cost $40, and it hasn't helped in the slightest way.  So, in just less than an hour, I'll be seeing an ophthalmologist in Worcester.  Hopefully, he'll be able to help me.  I've missed one day of work already because my vision is being affected on my left side.  My eye  really  hurts whenever I blink or close my eyelid too.  So, wish me luck!!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Relaxed.  LISTENING TO:   "Dr. Phil" on CBS.  The last few days have kept me very busy!  On Saturday, my youngest brother, Kevin, graduated from Blackstone Valley Regional Technical Vocational High School with a degree in automotive technology.  The commencement exercises were held at Mechanics Hall in Worcester, which was an appropriate selection.  The history of Mechanics Hall includes a time during which machinists and other tradesmen were trained for their jobs.  Kevin has been working part-time in the Mercedes Benz division of Foreign Motors West of Natick.  They will be providing intense paid training for him now that he's completed his education, and he'll be guaranteed a full-time position after the training.  On Thursday night, I came home from work (around 1:30 a.m.) and noticed a number of large ugly spiders clinging to the side of my house.  I let myself into the house, and decided to go back outside to get rid of the spiders.  As I went back outside, I pushed the screen door tightly closed behind me so that Marble, my cat, couldn't slip out.  I spent just a short time outside in the dark, and when I turned to come inside again, I couldn't open the screen door!  Apparently, it had closed beyond the point at which it should stop, so the door was hung up on the latch.  I tried the back door, and of course, it was locked.  So, because my keys were inside the house -- still visible in the doorknob -- I had to break into my own house.  I'll spare the embarrassing details, but basically, it involved opening a window and hauling myself inside.  My neighbors must have thought I was crazy, and I was lucky that they didn't call the police.  Just a night or two before that, I came home from work (again, around 1:30 a.m.) to find that my kitchen and bathroom had been completely overtaken by big black carpenter ants.  Ugh!  I was thoroughly disgusted.  But I killed every ant that I possibly could, including a queen or two, and then I covered the affected areas with Raid.  The next day, I called my landlord to complain: "Jeff, as I signed the lease, do you remember me asking you if there were any pest problems here?"  He responded, "Yes."  I said, "And do you remember that you said, 'Not that I'm aware of?'"  Again, he responded, "Yes."  I proceeded, "Well, I'm calling to make you aware of one...."  He apologized and said that no one who's lived here has ever complained about any problems.  And then he told me to deduct the cost of the Raid from the rent, and if the ants continued to be a problem, he'd send an exterminator.  I do still kill an occasional stray ant or two, but nothing like that one night.  ...ever seen the movie "Joe's Apartment?"  *grin*  Carpenter ants are common in this part of the United States, especially in areas that are near water.  So, I may never be able to get rid of them completely, but as long as I can keep them from carrying me into the yard during the night, I'll be okay.  It's just another thrill of having my own house.  Other than that, there isn't much going on around here.  I'm planning a housewarming party of sorts for the end of June, probably on a Saturday.  It'll be a mid-day cookout with access to the lake, etc.  I'm still checking with friends to find out what day might work best for most of them; if you have any thoughts, let me know!  I'll send invitations to everyone as soon as I've made definite plans.  I hope you can make it!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Slightly depressed.  LISTENING TO:   The ticking clock.  Tonight, I reflected on my days at college because one of my co-workers is returning to Framingham State College to continue his education.  Afterward, I came home and read my closest friends' blogs.  I think  urlLink Joey  put it best when she said, "The real world has its perks.  ...  But it sucks when the real world gets in the way of friends."  I really miss my friends.  My friends are all that I really have.  And when I think of how long it's been since I've had the chance to spend any real time with any of them, I feel very lonely and sad.  When we were in college, it was so easy to be together.  We were so closely knit.  But now, everyone is in the "real world," trying to earn a living in a world that makes life so difficult sometimes.  And the few friends who  are  still in college are transferring to other schools or entering their senior year (or both), so they'll be busier than ever too.  My point is this, I guess:  my friends are my world.  Without you, I am nothing.  I miss each of you dearly, and I look forward to the day that I'll see you again.  Be well....

       CURRENT MOOD:   Excited.  LISTENING TO:   "The People's Court" on UPN38.  Speaking of court, I spent the morning at East Boston District Court before a court magistrate and a state trooper, explaining my reasons for believing that I'm not responsible for the speeding ticket that I was given on February 29.  I arrived 30 minutes early.  Eventually, I was called into the courtroom with all of the other people who had requested a hearing.  The court magistrate met with each person by alphabetical order.  As I watched the people before me give their testimonies, I had to laugh at some of the stupid explanations that people gave.  In most cases, the magistrate held the people accountable for their violations.  In one or two cases, he reduced the fine to the new minimum of $100.  Eventually, my name was called.  The state trooper began reading information from the citation.  After the trooper had finished, the magistrate turned to me and asked, "Sir, what is your explanation?"  I responded, "Sir, at the time of the offense, the light that illuminated the speedometer was not working.  I was not able to detect this defect during my initial inspection of the vehicle due to the ambient daylight.  I'd like to present a letter from my employer, acknowledging the defect and its repair."  The magistrate read the letter, which also attested to my professional driving ability and the fact that I pass  Fast Lane  toll plazas 21 times per day, five days per week, minimum.  The magistrate raised an eyebrow and asked, "Wow.  Do you really travel the turnpike that much?"  I said, "Yes, sir, at a minimum.  So, I am familiar with the posted speed limit and the traffic conditions that generally exist where this offense occurred."  Then he poked out his bottom lip a little, and said, "The court finds you not responsible.  Have a good day."  I thanked him, nodded at the state trooper, and marched myself out of that courtroom before he could change his mind!  Then, I called my boss and told him that I owed him either a hug and kiss, or lunch.  My boss' letter helped my case without a doubt, but I had prepared several other arguments in case things didn't go as planned.  So, I'm not responsible for the citation.  It won't count as a reckless driving charge against my license (one of the tough consequences of speeding with a commercial driver's license).  My insurance premiums will not be affected.  My job will not be jeopardized.  And I won't have to pay the $180 fine.  For all intensive purposes, the citation is thrown out, as though it never happened.  (Yay!)

I'll be going before a Court Magistrate in East Boston District Court to plead my case against the speeding ticket that I was given in the bus on February 29.  I've prepared my case, as well as some very strong arguments.  I only hope that it's enough....  Wish me well, and I'll be sure to let you know of the outcome!  Thanks for your support.

       CURRENT MOOD:   Degraditated.  LISTENING TO:   The fan.  The week before last, I had a stupid argument with a senior co-worker at Logan Express.  The argument occurred because he publicly reprimanded two of us for joking with one another about a broken bus.  Understandably, he reprimanded us because we were making jokes at the company's expense while we probably should have been working to maintain a positive image of the company's reliability.  Even though I think it's reasonable to expect occasional breakdowns in the transportation industry, I understand why we were scolded.  However, the way in which it was handled left much to be desired.  We looked like  total  fools!  Shortly afterward, he tried to joke with us about another topic, and I gave him the "cold shoulder."  When he realized that I was ignoring him, he commented.  I explained that I felt he'd acted inappropriately.  He said he'd realized that he'd acted too abruptly and harshly, and that's why he tried to joke with us afterward.  But he never once  acknowledged  what he did, nor did he  apologize  for disciplining his co-workers in public.  I asked him how we were supposed to follow his thought process if he never mentioned his intents.  Then I pointed out the fact that any and every time I've done something that upset him, he's entirely ignored me until I stepped forward to apologize for my actions.  But when the table is turned, I'm supposed to let him slip it under the carpet as though nothing ever happened.   I think not!   I told him that I deserve respect too, and essentially, I told him (in a nice way) that if he can't recognize that fact, then he can blow it out his ass.  Needless to say, it's been two weeks now, and on my own two hands, I can count the number of words that we've said to each other.  This entire sequence of events is unfortunate because we used to get along very well.  We used to have a lot of fun at work.  One could say that we were friends.  But now, it's gone.

If I can teach myself (without private lessons) how to play a church organ well enough to serve as an organist on a regular basis, then I can teach myself how to play the guitar.  Time will tell!  But now, I must run.  I'm going to see the new Harry Potter movie tonight!  Later....

       CURRENT MOOD:   Irritated.  LISTENING TO:   "Cheers" on Nick@Nite.  I have just one word to describe yesterday: UGH!  My bus broke down, so I didn't get home from work until nearly 2:30 a.m.  The exhaust pipe broke where it connects to the turbo in the engine compartment.  It was drivable, I suppose, but it was  very  loud.  Plus, the heat and smoke from the exhaust was being blown around inside the engine compartment, rather than being routed outside the bus through the muffler.  Fortunately, though, I have today off, so it's not my problem!  In my last entry, I mentioned that I'm thinking of returning to school to become a paralegal.  Here's why.  For one week in April, I worked for a cellular store at the Natick Mall.  After the first week, I had to quit because the bus company changed my full-time schedule, and I wouldn't have been able to work at the store anymore.  I earned about $200 in pay that week, but the cellular company has not yet paid me for my time.  Actually, they sent me a check, but my name was spelled wrong, my address was wrong, the social security number wasn't mine, and the amount paid was wrong.  I sent a certified letter to them, granting ten final business days to deliver proper compensation before I initiate legal action.  I've heard nothing more, and the deadline is tomorrow!  It's only $200, but it's   my   $200.  I earned it!  So, if I don't get a check in today's or tomorrow's mail, I'll be filing a non-payment of wage complaint form with the Massachusetts Attorney General.  If the Attorney General can't produce any results within 90 days, then I can file my own lawsuit.  If the situation reaches this stage, I will be entitled to a considerable amount more than just $200.  So, this is why I'd like to become a paralegal.  I enjoy researching laws and preparing arguments or organizing details to prove my case.  It's a respectable career, and with experience would come better pay too.  Time will tell, but this could be my new career goal.  Onto another topic of interest.  One of my co-workers is  trying  to set me up with a girl who rides our buses very frequently.  Her name is Kelly, and she's a flight attendant for United Airlines.  She actually lives in North Carolina, but she's based in Boston with United Airlines.  When she's in the Boston area, she lives in Watertown with a roommate.  She's very nice: quiet, sweet, smart, funny, pretty....  Not that it matters, but she's also Chinese.  She's about my age, maybe a year or two or three older.  I don't know much about her, but I've talked to her quite a bit.  In fact, last week, I was 45 minutes late after work because I hung around talking to her!  So, who knows what'll happen?  Well, anyway, I should get going.  Tomorrow is my first day off in a long while.  I hope to sit around and do virtually nothing.  *grin*  And hopefully, it will be everything that I want it to be!  Be well, and I'll talk to you soon.

       CURRENT MOOD:   Run down.  LISTENING TO:   The air conditioner.  Well, I've been doing a lot of thinking -- a  lot  of thinking.  I've reached the following conclusion: I'm in a slump.  I'm still hung up on some things from the past, and therefore, I'm not able to focus clearly on the future.  Let me explain.  Consider my education first.  I attended my first-choice college, Ithaca College, and I threw it all away by devoting more time to extracurricular activities than to my studies.  I flunked.  I accomplished some great things after I transferred to Framingham State College, but realistically, I still don't have a degree.  Next, consider my personal life... or lack thereof.  My personal life has been so deeply affected by my disgustingly busy work schedule that it's virtually nonexistent now.  I dated an amazing girl for a short time a couple of years ago, but regretfully, foolishly, I let her slip away.  And I'm still  very  undecided as to the status of my most recent relationship.  Regardless though, what's done is done.  It's all in the past, and sadly, it should probably stay there.  Next, my career.  Where do I want to be in five or ten years?  Certainly, I do not want to be behind the wheel of a Logan Express bus!  And my dream of becoming a choral director is just a bit further from my grasp with each passing day.  I need to find something of interest that is more attainable.  There is much more, but my reader(s) only have so much time in a day!  So, what am I planning to do about all of this?  Well, I'm not completely sure.  I've identified the problem(s), so from here, I can move forward.  But as a start, I'm planning to return to school.  Maybe FSC.  Maybe another school.  I need to earn a degree.  I'm the first and only person from my family to attempt a full-time college education.  I've invested too much time to throw it all away.  And whereas becoming a choral director is beyond my grasp at this time, I'm changing my course of study to paralegal.  Yes, paralegal.  (I'll explain why in a later entry.)  And I'll continue various musical engagements on the side.  I'm hoping to return to school part-time by the spring of next year.  As far as my personal life is concerned, well, that will likely remain unchanged for some time.  But who knows?  If someone nice were to come my way, I could be more available.  "Don't go looking for love.  Let love find you!"

       CURRENT MOOD:   Excited.  LISTENING TO:   The birds.  "Take me down to New York City, where the grass is green and the girls are pretty!"  No, that's not right.  I think it was Albert Hammond who sang it best in 1974: "New York City, here I come!"    I've been to NYC just once to see a baseball game at Yankee Stadium (Yankees v. Red Sox, of course).  And since the Sox lost the game, I don't really consider it a worthwhile adventure.  I won't have a lot of time to see the sights this time either, but I'll have the opportunity to drive in NYC traffic for the first time in my life.  *grin*  I've always been told that if a person can handle NYC, he can handle anything.  We'll see.  Not much else is going on around here.  I established service with Millbury Rubbish Removal so that I don't have to mooch off of my parents' BFI service anymore.  It's pretty inexpensive because I live in the town of Millbury: about $29 for two months.  I was looking at my web site today, and I realized that I've let it fall by the wayside.  (It needs to be updated... badly.)  It needs some new things to make it more interesting too.  "Fung Wah" is a pretty dull boy when you get right down to it.  I'll see what I can do about this!  Anyway, I best be off for now.  Have a good day!

       CURRENT MOOD:  Degraditated.  LISTENING TO:   The air conditioner.  I have just one thing to say: T.G.I.F. Thankfully, the Democratic Convention is over, and the city should be back to "normal" by now. Traffic didn't really get bad until yesterday afternoon, despite the annoying road and lane closures. In fact, traffic really was quite light. I think the authorities scared a lot of people into staying away from Boston by exaggerating the anticipated traffic hassles. The hardest part of the entire week was keeping up with Logan Express' 15-minute schedule and the added security measures. Ugh!  Last night, I came home from work to find that the kid who maintains my "yard" had finally come over to do some work. I called him a month ago to tell him that things were getting overgrown, but he never came to do anything. That is, until yesterday. He cut everything: the grass, the flowers -- everything, despite my requests to leave the flowers alone. He even cut my day lilies right down to the ground, and then left the cut leaves and broken flower stalks scattered all over the ground! Well, needless to say, I was furious. So, I fired him this morning. I had my own landscaping business when I was young; I've thought about starting it up again. Perhaps this could be my opportunity.  Tomorrow night is going to be hell too. On Saturday nights, I work in the garage at the bus company in Millbury, refueling and washing the buses to prepare them for the next day's work. Well, tomorrow night, I'll nearly be washing the entire fleet! I can't wait. *rolling eyes*  Oh! Before I head off to work, I need to let everyone know that "The Musicam" will be up and running soon. Everything works, but I have to secure a full version of the software that uploads the web cam images to my web site. (To set up the camera, I used to free 10-day trial.) So, check back again soon!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Exhausted.   LISTENING TO:   The ceiling fan.     Well, it's late... or early, depending upon how you look at it. So, I'm going to bed (finally)! But first, I wanted to tell everyone about a new addition to my web site. It's  The Musicam . *grin* It's a still-frame photo that automatically updates every 30 seconds. Pretty cool... I just have to be sure it's not watching me sleep or pick my nose, among other things. Have a good night... er, day!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Tired.  LISTENING TO:   The air conditioner.  The last few days have been pretty tumultuous.  (That's a great word!)  Last week, I was going along one of the back roads of Oxford, and I decided I would leave my mark.  Of course, my wimpy Honda Civic doesn't have the horsepower to leave the mark the "right" way, so I had to improvise by yanking the hand brake at 40 miles per hour.  Wonderful for the tires and brakes!  So, after leaving two very black skid marks in the road, I couldn't seem to understand why my rear tires were making a subtle thumping sound.  Well, I later determined that my  very  intelligent use of sheer boredom created a enough of a flat spot on both of my rear tires to cause a subtle thumping sound as they spin.  While the flat spots will probably wear evenly again in time, I have to ask myself, "Why?"  The co-worker who'd been trying to set me up with the flight attendant called me on Monday to inform me that he had good news.  Apparently, he'd somehow convinced her to have lunch with me.  It couldn't hurt, I suppose, but I'd prefer that she join me for lunch or something under her own will without feeling pressured in any way.  I guess she's going to call me at some point when she gets back from San Francisco or wherever she is.  We'll see.  I have not heard anything more about the non-payment of wage complaint that I submitted to the Attorney General.  When I submitted the complaint, though, I was informed that they would likely take a month to process the complaint before I'd hear any more.  Legally, the Attorney General has a total of 90 days to produce  some  kind of results before I will be eligible to file a private suit against the former employer.  My new place is working out very well.  But sadly, it needs some work.  Because it was a summer cottage that was converted to a year-round home, it does not have a basement.  It simply has a crawl space under the floor.  I don't think the crawl space is properly insulated against moisture, as the house has taken on a kind of musty smell since the summer humidity arrived.  I've also noticed a couple of "soft spots" in one or two of the floor boards, which the landlord will need to repair before they become dangerous.  It's nothing to worry about now, but as they worsen, they will become a concern.  Fortunately, it shouldn't be a major repair... just enough to be a pain in the ass for everyone involved.  It's an older house -- about 65 years old.  It's bound to have a need for some repairs.  (And thankfully, the repair bills won't have my name on them!)  My experience with the new guitar is coming along.  I practice for about 20 to 30 minutes a day.  That's about as much as my fingers can take!  Strumming and holding the strings has been painful thus far, but now that my fingers are toughening up, it's getting better.  I ordered some finger picks too, which should help my cause.  So, I guess that's about it.  Everything else is going well.  The Democratic Convention will be here in less than two weeks.  Our bus service is gearing up by doubling the bus schedule to every 15 minutes.  Traffic is going to be a disaster with all of the road closures that will be in place throughout the week.  Moreover, various lane restrictions will be in place throughout the week on the few major routes that will be open, encouraging motorists to use alternative routes.  My suggestion to you: stay as far away from Boston as you can!  And if you  must  brave the traffic enroute to the city, be prepared for  anything ....

       CURRENT MOOD:   Caffeinated.  LISTENING TO:   The purring cat.  Ta-da!  I've finally updated my web site.  I was several months behind!  Oops....  The new musical selections are available now, and I also made some other minor changes here and there.  I noticed that someone else signed my guest book too.  (Thanks, Ericka!  You're the best!)  Just a couple of minor things are going on right now.  My guitar came and went.  Yes, it went too.  I'm sending it back.  I've always wanted to learn how to play the guitar, and this beginner's package was a really good deal.  Sadly, though, the first instructional DVD in the kit was defective.  And the manufacturer has done nothing to correct the problem, so I'm returning the entire kit.  (Why should I pay for something that I can't use?)  Unfortunately, that co-worker and I are still not up to par.  Frankly, I don't know that we  ever will be again, which is really pretty sad.  What's really sad, though, is that the flight attendant turned me down!!  (Recap: one of my other co-workers had been trying to set me up with a flight attendant who rides our buses a lot.)  As you know, I've been battling with a former employer about a payroll dispute.  Well, they failed to deliver my compensation by the date that I specified in my letter, so I referred the case to the Attorney General of Massachusetts.  I included all of the supporting documents that I had, including a copy of the invalid check that they issued to me, as well as the sales logs from the dates that I worked there  and  a signed statement from a former fellow employee.  (There's no way that I can lose this case!)  So, the Attorney General has 90 days to process and investigate my complaint, and if they're not able to produce any results in that time, I can (and will) file a small claims lawsuit in which I will be entitled to much more than the unpaid wages.  (Say, "Damages, times three.")  So, I guess that's about all that's been happening here.  I'm planning on a date around Labor Day to have a cookout/party here.  Check back for more info!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Relaxed.  LISTENING TO:  "The Blues Brothers" on AMC.  Tonight, I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11." I entered the theater with an open mind, but I left the theater in 100% agreement with Michael Moore's political views and opinions. Being the Democrat that I am, I was disappointed in George W. Bush from day one: his underhanded victory in the 2000 presidential election. His self-administered nickname is "The War President." Appropriately given, I'd say. But in his zeal to enter into war, thus attempting to finish what his father started many years ago, our "War President" alienated our allies, killed thousands of innocent civilians and militia, and betrayed the trust of the American people. He didn't get my vote in 2000, and he won't get it in 2004 either. I'll be with John Kerry and the Democrats!  P.S.  I submitted a written request to the Massachusetts State Police for a copy of the official investigative report pertaining to my accident.  As soon as I have it, I'll post a copy here for everyone to read.  It should be good!

       CURRENT MOOD:   Very happy.  LISTENING TO:   The air conditioner.  So,  have  you ever wondered what happens to the momentum of a 25-ton bus when it rear-ends a Honda Accord at 45 to 50 miles per hour? I ask this question because while the answer lies in simple physics, I presented a fine demonstration on the turnpike on Monday night. That's right: I had an accident... a BIG one!  I was traveling east on the MassPike around 8:45 p.m. on Monday night. The left lane was closed for construction. I'd been in the right lane behind a white Oldsmobile Alero since the Weston Toll Plaza, and for much of the way, a green Honda Accord had been beside the bus. Several times, the driver of the Honda accelerated very hard to stay slightly ahead of the bus, such that I couldn't pass him. But about 1 mile before exit 17 in Newton, as we were approaching a trailer in the middle lane, the Honda accelerated very hard to cut in front of the bus. He cut in front of the bus with just five or six feet to spare, and then he realized that the white Oldsmobile was blocking his path. He slammed on his brakes, and due to the lack of room that he'd given himself to safely change lanes in front of the bus, I had nowhere to go. I  stood  on the brake pedal, jammed the transmission retarder into full force,  and  locked up the wheels. But due to the weight of the bus and the delay of the air brakes, it wasn't enough. I plowed into the back of the Honda at about 50 miles per hour. The impact caused the car to lurch forward, hitting the white Oldsmobile. The Oldsmobile spun around into the middle lane to face oncoming traffic (and the bus, which was still skidding to a stop), and clipped the trailer that the Honda was trying to pass in the first place. Thankfully, no one was injured, and one of my passengers gave her name as a witness.  Due to the amount of damage that was caused, an investigation is ongoing by the Massachusetts State Police, Troop E. I will post the official report here when the results are available. (According to the investigating officer, the report should be available on Monday.) And by the way, while the Honda and Oldsmobile were heavily damaged, the bus did not sustain so much as a scratch!  Everyday, drivers cut off trucks and buses dangerously close without considering the potential hazards of their actions. Did you know that from 70 miles per hour, it will take a bus nearly two football fields to stop? In most cases, buses and trucks have air brakes, which have a short delay between the time that you step on the pedal and the brakes actually engage. Once the brakes are engaged, they heat up very quickly due to the extreme weight of the vehicle, causing a dangerous condition known as brake fade. When the brakes fade as they heat up, they work less efficiently, making a large vehicle's stopping distance even greater. These are the risks that people take when they cut off a large vehicle. And very often, the only time that they save is a car's length or two -- merely a few tenths of a second at highway speeds. Is it really worth it?
