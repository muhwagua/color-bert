       Resume   I redid my resume to get rid of the ugly HTML code that Word generates...also got the look to mesh with the rest of the site.  Also recently made the links on the left look better, and added a few. The site is slowly coming along. In the future sometime, I'd like to make it more dynamic (using PHP and JavaScript) and to add a bunch more content and interesting stuff.

       Slacking   Wow, I've been a big slacker with respect to this page...  [excuse]I was super-busy with finals/thesis/projects at the end of november and the beginning of december, and since then, I've been very busy doing nothing in particular (shopping, relaxing, hanging with family and home-friends).[/excuse]  Oh well. Hopefully I will be better as the end of this vacation nears, and make good and making this page something less useless (other than it's ability to stoke my geekness).  While you're here, check some of the pages that I've been reading lately to waste time:  urlLink wilwheaton.net   urlLink metafilter   urlLink buddha   urlLink slashdot

       hmmmm....   Well, now that it's been six weeks since my last post, it looks like I've run out of excuses for not updating this page. Oh well. I'm trying to figure out a use for this page that I will get really psyched about, beyond the current function as a resume place-holder. I'm hoping that this summer during my trip, I can use it as an online journal to track our progress. We shall see.

       Get on, Gettin' On   Well, I am finally making good on my promise to do something with this site. In less than a week, Dominic and I will be leaving for our cross (or rather round) country trip of the US. Above you should see a link for trip updates....from that, you can get access to our planned itinerary, our actual progress, some pictures and updates of what we've been doing and what we want to be doing.

       More Job Stuff   I am still employed for the fall, but in searching for something to do this summer, I decided to apply to the summer program I attended after my Junior year in high school (and where Jen and I met). The  urlLink Advanced Studies Progarm  at  urlLink St. Paul's  was a great summer where I studied Biomedical Ethics, rowed crew, and had my first college-like experience. I have an interview in a few hours for a teaching internship in either Artificial Intelligence or Law and Finance.   Wish me luck!

       Project   I mentioned in an earlier post that I am working on a hardware design project this term. It's been interesting so far, but the things I am learning are not what I expected. More than electrical engineering, I am finding the biggest challenge to be working with suppliers, sifting through tons of data to make informed decisions, planning project time well so that lead times for parts and workload mesh, and managing project work in general.

       Me   A bunch has happened since my last entry (sadly, almost two months ago).   I accepted a job with  urlLink Decision Architects  in Cambridge, Mass. It's a small division of the  urlLink Monitor Group . I'm really excited about the job (not withstanding the fact that any job in this economy is great). I'm going to be doing interesting work (programming, financial modeling, consulting), working with young, fun people, travelling, and living in a great city.   I also finished up my second-to-last term taking classes here. This term, I am not enrolled, instead working on an interesting hardware design independent study in Hanover. It's strange not to have a set schedule, but nice to be able to control my own work load, beef-up some of my engineering training, and learn lots of interesting stuff.   Other than those major developments, things are good. Enjoying (sort of) the snowy weather up here, seeing my family more often, and spending free time with Jen on the weekends.  Look out for more updates and site changes soon!

The House of God is a book that Ryan recommended to me, a surprisingly realistic (maybe) and cynical (definitely) look at 6 interns' from the "Best Medical School" at "The House of God." (i.e. Harvard and Beth Israel). Up next is a book called "Arab and Jew" by David Shipler, and some of Jeff Shaara's Civil War books.

       Memorable   I have a lot of links in my Bookmark/Favorites file. I have a folder called 'Daily' for sites I check every day (duh...) like  urlLink the D ,  urlLink Slashdot ,  urlLink MeFi , and such. Then I have a folder called 'Occaisionally' for sites that are updated less often, or that I only check at certain times of the week (like Fridays for new movies). And then, in addition to a folder for the project I am currently working on, I have a folder called 'Memorable.' I save in here news stories and sites that were too long for me to read right when I linked them, or more often, that I found interesting. Here are some selections from that folder, if you get bored:   AlterNet The U.S. Is Looking for an Excuse To Fight   craigslist best of   Economist.com  Library  Style Guide   Guardian Unlimited  The Guardian  Too much of a good thing   How To Write Unmaintainable Code   International Snow Sculpture Championships   Questions for Conversations about Iraq   Reagan's Son   Wayne Madsen After the Fall   Why Nerds are Unpopular

       More Updates   In an effort to get myself to take some more pictures more frequently, I put the pictures column on the right, which I will add to periodically.  Also, I am thinking about changing over to Moveable Type instead of Blogger. But I'll probably wait to see what the new Google/Blogger buyout means before doing anything. For now, I'm looking into the former.

      Jen took me on an amazing weekend to Vermont this weekend, to stay at the great place called the Mountain Top Inn in Chittenden. You can see some pictures  urlLink here .   The weekend was super relaxing, with me getting my very first professional massage, sleeping a lot, walking around the grounds, taking a sleigh ride, hot tub, all that good stuff.   One of the best things was the food. A great restaurant. Samples of some of our meals:    Friday Dinner: - Chipotle Battered Calamari - Roast New Zealand Lamb, with New Potatoes and Veggies - Quail with Fingerling Potatoes - Turtle Cheesecake - Hazelnut Praline Cheesecake  Saturday Breakfast: - Eggs Benedict with Prosciutto, Vine Ripe Tomatoes, and Hollandaise - Corn Flake Crusted Brioche French Toast, with Vermont Maple Syrup  Saturday Dinner - French Onion Soup - Shrimp Caesar Salad - Fried Goat Cheese Salad  Sunday Breakfast: - Huevos Rancheros with Homemade Whole-wheat Tortillias and Salsa

      My master's degree project is finished!!!  I just got out of my presentation to the faculty/industry review board. It ended up going as well as I could have hoped. The project itself was mostly successful. I wasn't able to complete everything I set out (for reasons beyond my control), which was somewhat disappointing. But given that, they seemed to be pleased with the quantity and quality of my work.   So, now, I get to stay involved with the project (which I am happy about), but I don't have to worry about writing a huge report at the end (which makes me even happier).  Now, I can really concentrate on classes, and having a more normal schedule again.

        It is even too late for last minute things to buy, there are too few shops open. We went again for a drive thru Baghdad’s main streets. Too depressing. I have never seen Baghdad like this. Today the Ba’ath party people started taking their places in the trenches and main squares and intersections, fully armed and freshly shaven. They looked too clean and well groomed to defend anything. And the most shocking thing was the number of kids.   A  urlLink blog from an Iraqi in Baghdad .

        Google understands that its two most important assets are the attention and trust of its users. If it takes too long to deliver results or an additional word of text on the home page is too distracting, Google risks losing people's attention. If the search results are lousy, or if they are compromised by advertising, it risks losing people's trust. Attention and trust are sacrosanct.   From the  urlLink Fast Company article  the above quote is one of the reasons that Google.com is my homepage, and probably won't be changing anytime soon.   And in my vain sort of way, I can't help getting excited when this website is the first response on a google search on either  urlLink chittim  or  urlLink greg chittim .

       French Week    Crepes a la maniere de Idle Words  3 eggs 3/4 cup whole wheat flour 3/4 cup white flour A bunch of whole milk Pinch o'salt 1/4 cup sugar, for sweet crêpes 1 glass red wine  If you're making sweet crepes, use white flour instead of whole wheat, and add a quarter cup of sugar to the batter at some point. Mix the eggs and flour together, and then stir in milk until the batter is runnier than you think it should be. You want the consistency of very thin gravy, but without any lumps. Let sit for at least 2 hours at room temperature. Salmonella, shlalmonella. Drink the red wine. After two hours have passed, heat up a large heavy frying pan good and hot. Rub the pan with butter or oil at the outset, and after every other crepe. You want only enough batter to coat the pan surface; pour the batter in the center and spread it evenly by tilting the pan. The crepes should come out very thin and pliable. It's tempting to set the the heat too low -- if the crepe is sticking to the pan, takes a long time to cook, and the edges aren't curling up, the pan is too cold. If the crepe has black blisters on its belly, or goes up in a smoky fireball as soon as the batter hits the pan, then reduce the heat a little bit.  It's French week over at  urlLink Idle Words  and they have some great entries. The Top Ten Reasons to Love France, the Real History of WWII, some yummy crepe recipes, and a comparison of French and US school lunch menus are some of the highlights so far.

       Boston WiFi    Tech Superpowers, a Boston-based Apple reseller, is building a small, high-speed Wi-Fi network for local residents. Bostonians get to log on for free, as long as they put up with a pop-up advertisement every three to four hours.    urlLink Wired  gives a quick report about this free wireless access in my future home city. Looking forward to trying it out. I am so spoiled having pervasive WiFi here at Dartmouth, but I support I can put up with one popup every few hours.

       Chess Intelligence    The original chess-playing algorithm, proposed more than 50 years ago by Claude Shannon, the electrical engineer who founded information theory, begins with the search function, which generates all possible move sequences to a certain depth, set by the computer's speed and memory. Then each end position is graded, numerically, by an evaluation function that assigns value to such aspects of chess knowledge as material (pawn = 1 point, knight = 3 points, rook = 5 points, queen = 9 points), king safety (good), piece mobility (good), doubled pawns (bad, usually), and so forth. The computer then selects the move that, given the perfect play by the opponent, leads to the position having the highest score.   I've always liked playing chess, and been curious about how computer chess programs work. The quote above from  urlLink IEEE Spectrum  gives a great simple description of how they work in the most basic sense.

        IMDb and IBL   I use the  urlLink Internet Movie Database  on a very regular basis, and it is one of my favorite sites to browse. So, I was really psyched when I read about the  urlLink Internet Book List , a site with a similar concept, but obviously, for books instead of movies. But, after looking around the latter, I am convinced that a site like this isn't really going to succeed until that get at least an initial boost from cooperation by publishers, and least to initially populate the database. While I love "The Hitchhiker's Guide the the Galaxy, I doubt it is the most popular book out there. Great idea though. With some cooperation from the industry, it could be an amazing resource.

       Hybrid SUVs   While I am very anti-SUVs in a lot of ways, I'm not sure   urlLink this   is really the answer. The Big Three are doing so bad to begin with, undertaking an endeavor to sell cars at a loss in this economy seems like it might endanger Ford's future ability to introduce more promising green technologies.  That being said, I think the more car companies (American in particular) do to reduce this country's obscene use of gasoline and big cars, the better. So, I am conflicted on how I feel about this. Good for Ford, but are they sure hybrid SUVs are what anyone but the typical early adopters want?   UPDATE: After looking into this more,  urlLink Toyota  is also introducing a  urlLink RAV4 hybrid .

       Nano-lock   Whenever I give a tour here at  urlLink Thayer  I stop and talk for a bit at the MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) lab. Students and parents often ask me what the technology might be used for in the future.  urlLink Here  is a great answer. It is a nano-scale combination lock developed at Sandia National Labs that is printed on a silicon wafer, and can be manipulated with electrical signals. If the user enters the wrong combination, it cannot be unlocked until someone (the administrator of the system) resets it. Pretty nifty security device.

       Best Program EVER   Well, not really. But indispensable to me, especially when I have umpteen windows open at once.  urlLink JSPager  allows you to have multiple desktops, like in Linux.

I have a feeling I won't be in such a high powered room for a long long time.

        UK military forces may be making strides on the battlefield in Iraq, but it was a different story on the soccer pitch for 11 Royal Marines. The British soldiers suffered defeat on the dusty streets of Umm Khayyal, when they took on the local football team. A thousand spectators came from all ends of the town to watch the match, with the players wearing full strip, boots and squad numbers. The home side was rallied to a 9-3 victory by throngs of screaming men and children, who marked out the boundaries of the pitch.   I thought  urlLink this  was a really neat story. It's nice to see that things are somewhat normal in some places in the Middle East.

      I haven't posted for the past few days. Things have been really busy with beginning of the term craziness. On Monday, I spent the day shadowing Andy Clapp, a venture capitalist at  urlLink Brook Venture . I didn't really know what to expect going into the day, but it turned out to be really interesting. I imagined all VCs to have the outrageously swank lifestyles and offices, and ruling their funded companies like lords rules their middle age serfs. It turned out to be quite the opposite. In spending the day with Andy and his partners, I found them the be extremely smart and nice businessmen, who worked very hard to support the companies they have funded. They act as advisors for groups that need their support and help, and probably wouldn't be as successful if they didn't have access to the VCs experience. In the end, I can't imagine many more interesting jobs that what a VC does -- you are involved with multiple companies, often at the leading edge of technology, helping to make them a successful reality.

      Jen and I went to see  urlLink John Mayer  and  urlLink Counting Crows  the  urlLink Tweeter Center  (aka The Venue Formerly Known As Great Woods) on Friday. The concert was at 7pm, and was 40 miles away. So, I left work at 5, the apartment at 5:30, and we packed a dinner to eat on te way. Plenty of time, right?   Think again.  The second great flood decided to come to the South Shore, and all of New England decided to come to the concert. Not a good combination. It took us three hours to get there, and then after a great concert (more on this later) it took us 90 minutes to get the half mile out of the parking lot. Though luckily only 40 minutes to get home after that.   Despite the long time in the car, it was an awesome evening. Even though we didn't get there till 8:40, the Counting Crows were only about half way through an amazingly long, great set. I forgot how much I like them -- I am definitely gonna have to pick up their new CD. At about 9:30, the finished up, and John Mayer came on about 10. Sadly, he only played for an hour, including an encore (sadly lacking in 83-ness). It was definitely a great show though, and it was wonderful to see how much Jen liked it.  The rest of the weekend was spent relaxing, catching up on sleep (I'm not used to this wakin' up early and workin' all day thing!!! ;-).  We did grab some dinner at  urlLink Redbones  in Davis. I had heard great things, but I was really disappointed. I am hoping that is was cause we went really early on a Sunday night and the cook was overtired or something, but based on the meal I had, I wouldn't go back. We shared a sampler meal which included Memphis, Arkansas, and Texas Ribs, and some Brisket --- the only thing that I would rate above a 5 were the Memphis ribs -- everything else was way dry and not very tasty. Oh well...I guess I was spoiled by our  urlLink trip  to  urlLink Memphis .  And then is was back to work today. I really like my job, and am amazed at how little I mind working fairly long hours. Today I worked 7am-6pm, which will be pretty typical, and it didn't seem long at all. I think it's cause more than any other job I have had, it is very collaborative (lots of work meetings with 1 or 2 other people) so I don't get bored sitting at my desk. And when I am sitting at my desk, I have a ton to do.

       Executive Mansion,  Washington, , 186 .  Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, upon this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that "all men are created equal"  Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of it, as a final resting place for those who died here, that the nation might live. This we may, in all propriety do. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow, this ground-- The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have hallowed it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here; while it can never forget what they did here.  It is rather for us, the living, we here be dedica-ted to the great task remaining before us -- that, from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here, gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve these dead shall not have died in vain; that the nation, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people by the people for the people, shall not perish from the earth.                     - Abraham Lincoln  from  urlLink  100 Documents that shaped America

      After a busy week at  urlLink work , Jen and I have a fun weekend planned. Today, after sleeping late and lounging around the apartment, we went downtown to the  urlLink Boston Arts Festival . We heard some great jazz, the Boston Wind Symphony, and saw lots of exhibits by random artists. I think I have pretty eclectic art tastes -- I generally seem attacted to Art Deco, Asian, and Modern/Contemporary. It was nice to see everything -- it gave me the idea to try and take some good pictures, get them printed in black and white, and put them up in our bathroom (which happens to be black and white and has no decoration in it).   Tomorrow, Jen and I are going to the Red Sox game -- I won the ticket lottery at work. Every few days, someone emails out to everyone in the Cambridge office if the company tickets are available -- somehow I actually was the first person to email back this time, so I got them. We'll be in a box seat on the right field line. Yay!

      Once again, I have been remiss in my posting duties. To all 20 of you who may check this site every day in hopes of finding choice tidbits about my life, I apologize.   And now, ladies and gentlemen, for your reading pleasure, an update on the past few weeks:  - I wrote a  urlLink while back  that Jen and I went to  urlLink Taranta  for dinner as part of Boston's Restaurant Week. While it was good, it certainly wasn't as amazing as reviews claimed, nor was it that great a value. However, our repeat engagement of Restaurant Week at  urlLink Icarus  was a different story. I can honestly say it was one of the best meals I have ever eaten. First of all, the place was beautiful...down in the basement of a South End building (sounds promising, right?!?!) it has beautiful dark wood, cozy tables, but also had high ceilings and a very sophisticated roomy air to it. The waitstaff was awesome -- attentive but also invisible. Here is what we had:   Cold Avocado Soup with Shrimp Salsa (G)  - tasted like guacamole with the consistency of whipped cream -- sounds weird, but amazing.  Heirloom Tomato Salad (J)  - these tomatoes were so perfect, I loved them -- and I hate tomatoes.  Leg of Lamb with White Beans and Balsamic Reduction (J)  - a great cut of meat that was very tasty.  Wild Alaskan Salmon with Sweet Corn and Fingerling Potatoes (G)  - simply the best piece of fish I have ever eaten. So fresh, I swear it was swimming 20 minutes before it was on my plate.  Toasted Almond Pound Cake with Blueberry Compote and Vanilla Bean Ice Cream  - simple and delicious.  Pots du Creme (J)  - an extremely rich chocolate mouse -- not my style, but tasty nonetheless  - Now that I have written about the uber-classy places Jen and I ate, it's time to move to the other end (and yet equally delicious) end of the spectrum:  urlLink The Hopkinton State Fair . This happens every Labor Day weekend in my home town, and is the home of all thing 4-H and fattening. While I do not like the smelly former, I do love the tasty latter. And for that reason, I certainly couldn't pass up the Fried Milky Way, or the fresh Jumbo Glazed Donut. I great way to get your weeks worth of fat calories in about 3 hours.  - To work off some of those calories, we went salsa dancing at  urlLink Johnny D's  on Sunday night -- a ton of fun. I am not a dancing type (except in the kitchen with Jen) -- but I picked it up relatively quickly (the basics at least) -- and am psyched to go again as soon as Jen's toes recover.  - We also had a little apartment warming party at our apartment a few days ago -- it was great to get a bunch of our friends together to show off our place, hang out, relax, and catch up on each other's lives. We are definitely planning on having more, but likely as dinner parties with fewer people.  Once again, I will make an effort to post more often, but we know how well I follow through on those promises.

        A gallon-sized jar of whole pickles is something to behold. The jar is the size of a small aquarium. The fat green pickles, floating in swampy juice, look reptilian, their shapes exaggerated by the glass. It weighs 12 pounds, too big to carry with one hand. The gallon jar of pickles is a display of abundance and excess; it is entrancing, and also vaguely unsettling. This is the product that Wal-Mart fell in love with: Vlasic's gallon jar of pickles.  Wal-Mart priced it at $2.97--a year's supply of pickles for less than $3! "They were using it as a 'statement' item," says Pat Hunn, who calls himself the "mad scientist" of Vlasic's gallon jar. "Wal-Mart was putting it before consumers, saying, This represents what Wal-Mart's about. You can buy a stinkin' gallon of pickles for $2.97. And it's the nation's number-one brand."   urlLink This  article is a great look into Wal Mart. For many things, Wal Mart is so damn convenient that I can't help shopping there, but is always makes me a bit uncomfortable to do so.

         Werner Heisenberg, Kurt Godel and Noam Chomsky walk into a bar.  Heisenberg looks around the bar and says, "Because there are three of us and because this is a bar, it must be a joke. But the question remains, is it funny or not?"  And Godel thinks for a moment and says, "Well, because we're inside the joke, we can't tell whether it's funny. We'd have to be outside looking at it."  And Chomsky looks at both of them and says, "Of course it's funny. You're just telling it wrong."     these jokes  definitely made me laugh out loud.

         Dave Winfield  Winfield could do it all on the baseball field -- hit for power, run (three times he finished in the top eight in triples, and in four seasons he stole more than 20 bases), and field, winning the Gold Glove seven times. Winfield, who played for the University of Minnesota, was the Gophers' best hitter and pitcher, not a shabby achievement considering Minnesota made it to the semis of the 1973 College World Series. After 22 major-league seasons -- he never played in the minors -- Winfield was elected to the Hall of Fame in 2001, his first year of eligibility.  But there's more. He was also good enough to play pro basketball, drafted by both the Atlanta Hawks and the Utah Stars after starring as a power forward on Minnesota's Big Ten championship team. And he was such a great athlete that even though he never played a single down in college, the Vikings selected him in the 1973 draft. No other athlete has ever been drafted in all three pro sports.

        The Bush administration's plans for a new caretaker government in Iraq would place severe limits on its sovereignty, including only partial command over its armed forces and no authority to enact new laws, administration officials said Thursday...Only 10 weeks from the scheduled transfer of sovereignty, the administration is still not sure exactly who will govern in Baghdad, or precisely how they will be selected.  So what you're saying is that a) you are going to be handing back a country that is in total chaos and pulling out but b) you're not allowing the government you leave behind to control their own armed forces and or enact new laws? Does that seem like a handover that is only in the best interests of the Bush administration and not the Iraqi people's to anyone else? I thought so. |  urlLink via  |

        After decades of colonialism and misrule, and then a traumatic dictatorship in an already tribalized society, Iraqi national identity is weak — and insecurity only weakens it more by prompting people to fall back on their tribal units. But there is an Iraqi identity. It takes security, though, for it to emerge. Even Iraqis don't know how strong it is, and they won't know until they are handed the keys.  Only then can we gradually shift the burden for Iraq's self-construction or self-destruction to Iraqis themselves. Only then will they begin to be accountable — and accountability is the mother of both self-restraint and self-government.

        George W. Bush promised us a foreign policy with humility. Instead, he has brought us humiliation in the eyes of the world.  He promised to "restore honor and integrity to the White House." Instead, he has brought deep dishonor to our country and built a durable reputation as the most dishonest President since Richard Nixon.  Honor? He decided not to honor the Geneva Convention. Just as he would not honor the United Nations, international treaties, the opinions of our allies, the role of Congress and the courts, or what Jefferson described as "a decent respect for the opinion of mankind." He did not honor the advice, experience and judgment of our military leaders in designing his invasion of Iraq. And now he will not honor our fallen dead by attending any funerals or even by permitting photos of their flag-draped coffins.  How did we get from September 12th , 2001, when a leading French newspaper ran a giant headline with the words "We Are All Americans Now" and when we had the good will and empathy of all the world -- to the horror that we all felt in witnessing the pictures of torture in Abu Ghraib.

But here’s the good news. You fix this thing, you’re the next greatest generation, people. You do this—and I believe you can—you win this war on terror, and Tom Brokaw’s kissing your ass from here to Tikrit, let me tell ya. And even if you don’t, you’re not gonna have much trouble surpassing my generation. If you end up getting your picture taken next to a naked guy pile of enemy prisoners and don’t give the thumbs up you’ve outdid us.  We declared war on terror.

        Considering that most of the worst ideas in the last two films came from Lucas himself, he might start by handing over the reins to another filmmaker.  It might be difficult to convince Lucas to go along with it, but if necessary Lucas could probably be tricked by telling him that Joseph Campbell is waiting with a documentary crew to massage Lucas’ ego by interviewing him about his wonderful mythic imagination. When Lucas shows up, knock him out, encase him in a block of frozen carbonite and put him out of the way somewhere until the movie is out in theaters.

        I have made a career of taking bungee jumps in my election calls. Sometimes I haven't had a helmet and I have gotten a little scratched. But here is my jump for 2004: John Kerry will win the election.  Have you recovered from the shock? Is this guy nuts? Kerry's performance of late has hardly been inspiring and polls show that most Americans have no sense of where he really stands on the key issues that matter most to them. Regardless, I still think that he will win. And if he doesn't, it will be because he blew it.  John Zogby makes his  urlLink prediction .

        Ben Duskin, nine years old, is in remission from Leukemia. Throughout his course of treatment, Ben played computer games and began to think about the need to have something positive to help others kids battle their illnesses. Ben’s wish was to design a video game that would be helpful for kids like him who have cancer, a way to fight back and relieve some of the pain and stress involved with treatment.   So the Greater Bay Area Make-A-Wish Foundation® sought out game companies to find a champion to make Ben's wish come true. “The initial response was overwhelmingly pessimistic” said Patricia Wilson, Executive Director.  “People told us this venture was nearly impossible without taking several years and literally millions of dollars.” A hero stepped forward: Eric Johnston, and his employer LucasArts fully supported his efforts.  Not only did Eric want to make Ben's wish a reality, he planned to involve Ben in every step of the process.  For months, Ben and Eric have been meeting on a regular basis to make the game just as Ben envisioned it.    You can download Ben's Game  urlLink here

        Shipping great software on time is a difficult but not impossible task. Elements you think would count the most count for very little. Development methodology, process, technical prowess, excellence of tools and depth of project management skills all influence the outcome of a software development project; but nothing indicates success as much as the manager’s ability to focus on a few critical and conceptually simple things. These things can be expressed as rules of thumb.

        But once "F9/11" gets to audiences beyond screenings, it won't be dependent on celebrities for approbation. It turns out to be a really brilliant piece of work, and a film that members of all political parties should see without fail.  As much as some might try to marginalize this film as a screed against President George Bush, "F9/11" — as we saw last night — is a tribute to patriotism, to the American sense of duty  —  and at the same time a indictment of stupidity and avarice.  Fox News  urlLink raves  about Michael Moore's new file Fahrenheit 9/11.

        After three days of suspended political activity, the Bush campaign began openly incorporating Ronald Reagan's death into its reelection message yesterday, revamping its website to give Reagan a dominant role and distributing official campaign letters that invoke the former president.  Since Reagan's death Saturday, Bush has repeatedly offered glowing praise of the 40th president in ways that echo his own reelection efforts, but were not overtly political.   urlLink This  is really starting to smell bad to me. Pay tribute to the man, but don't take advantage of his legacy. In the unlikely event that the  urlLink other side  did something similar, I would say the same thing.

        Steven R. Koonin, the executive vice president of TBS, has a theory about "Sex and the City," the hit HBO series scheduled to make its debut on Tuesday on his basic cable channel.  "I don't think anyone watched it for sex and nudity," he said.  Mr. Koonin has to hope he is right, because the explicit sex and frontal nudity are precisely what have been edited out — along with a few select, and not infrequently used, words — as HBO's editors cleaned up the show for broadcast on TBS, which like HBO is a unit of Time Warner.   I think taking out the  urlLink sex out of Sex and the City  for air on TBS will make it a totally new and different show. Whether that new show is any good remains to be seen.

        Next month, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority will become the first transit agency in the nation to institute a permanent policy of randomly inspecting passenger bags and packages on subway and commuter trains, MBTA police officials disclosed yesterday.  The stop-and-search procedure, largely prompted by the March 11 train bombings that killed 191 people in Spain, will involve explosive-sniffing dogs and all 247 uniformed MBTA police officers, and is set to be in place for July's Democratic National Convention, MBTA T Police Chief Joseph Cartercq told the Globe.  "I have no trepidation about being first,'' Carter said. "I don't want to be the first to do an interview about having a serious incident that may have some terrorist indications to it. I want to be in a position to prevent and detect and apprehend someone prior to them causing damage. We want to do this to encourage people to feel safe on the MBTA, to utilize public transportation.  As long as they are not too Draconian in their implmentation of  urlLink this  it seems like a fine idea to me. It always struck me how little public transportation security there is in the US compared to Europe. Nothing like the sight of a member of the Gendarmie holding a machine gun to keep you in line on the Metro in Paris.

        You know the Simpsons from their Butterfinger and Burger King appearances in the US. This is just five of many Simpsons for CC Lemon ads that have appeared on TV here in Japan over the years.

I saw his picture again today on the  urlLink front page of Boston.com , as he presided over Ronald Reagan's memorial service in California at the presidential library. I remember Michael and his wife as amazingly kind people, and as great friends of my parents. I am sure that he is providing a world of comfort to Mrs. Reagan and her family.

        Obama, lanky and dapper in a dark suit, his shoulders almost strangely relaxed, seemed to know most of the men there. He broke the ice with a joke at the expense of Ed Smith, a huge, tough-looking delegate from Cairo. Obama had met Smith’s mother on a recent downstate swing and had discovered that “she’s the one who really calls the shots there.” Smith laughed, and the other delegates said they wanted her phone number. Then Obama gave a short, blunt, pro-labor speech. The men eyed him carefully. Heads began nodding slowly, jaws set, as he drove his points home: “two hundred thousand jobs lost in Illinois under Bush; overtime rights under threat for eight million workers nationally; the right to organize being eroded.” Then he said, “I need your help,”   An  urlLink interesting profile  (though somewhat outdated as it still discusses Jack Ryan as a candidate) in the New Yorker.

      Kos makes some  urlLink interesting points  about many Republicans citing Barak Obama's speech last night as conservative. Some interesting quotes:  This is funny. Obama is clearly beyond reasonable attack, so the talking point of the Right appears to be, "his speech was conservative". ... Over at NRO's "The Corner", one of the posts reads:   RIGHT SPEECH, WRONG CONVENTION [Roger Clegg] Barack Obama gave a fine speech, but it was not a speech that reflects the current Democratic Party. It celebrated America as "a magical place"; it did not bemoan our racism and imperialism. It professed that this black man "owe[d] a debt to those who came before" him; it did not call for reparations. It spoke of an "awesome God"; it did not banish Him from public discourse. It admitted that black parents, and black culture, need to change the way black children are raised; it did not blame or even mention racism. It quoted "E pluribus unum" and translated it correctly as "Out of many, one"; it did not misquote it, as Al Gore infamously did, as "Many out of one." Most of all, the speech celebrated one America, "one people," and rejected the notion of a black America, a white America, a Latino America, and an Asian America--a notion completely foreign to the multiculturalism that now dominates the Democratic Party. Right. Powell was booed at the RNC convention four years ago, because his speech -- pro-choice, pro-affirmative action, didn't reflect the Republican Party. This is different. Is reparations a mainstream liberal issue? No. Is unity a conservative value? Laughable, as the Republican Party has fueled its electoral dominance via the Southern Strategy -- using race to scare white southerners to vote Republican against their economic interests -- while attempting to maintain that dominance by demonizing gays.     I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to see the speech live. I'm going to track down some video of it online...

        Good evening and welcome to "The Daily Show." We are back. This is our first show since the tragedy in New York City. There is no other way really to start this show than to ask you at home the question that we've asked the audience here tonight and that we’ve asked everybody that we know here in New York since September 11th, and that is, "Are you okay?" We pray that you are and that your family is. I’m sorry to do this to you. It’s another entertainment show beginning with an overwrought speech of a shaken host. TV is nothing, if not redundant. So, I apologize for that. It’s something that unfortunately, we do for ourselves so that we can drain whatever abscess is in our hearts and move onto the business of making you laugh, which we really haven’t been able to do very effectively lately. Everyone’s checked in already, I know we’re late. I’m sure we’re getting in right under the wire before the cast of "Survivor" offers their insight into what to do in these situations.  A  urlLink segment from the Daily Show  from the first airing after 9/11. Amazingly moving.

        Like many scholars, Charles Trumbull hoped that one day his work would attract attention in high places. So you might think he'd be thrilled that someone in the White House used one of his research papers to draft a speech for President Bush last week. But he's not. In a hotel conference room in Tampa, Fla., on Friday, Bush told law enforcement officials that Fidel Castro was brazenly promoting sex tourism to Cuba. "The dictator welcomes sex tourism. Here's how he bragged about the industry," Bush said. "This is his quote: 'Cuba has the cleanest and most educated prostitutes in the world.' " Asked about the source for the quote, White House officials provided a link to a 2001 paper, written by Trumbull, on the website of the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy. At the time he wrote the paper, Trumbull was a Dartmouth College undergraduate, and the paper won a prize from the association as the best student paper of the year.  The Charlie Trumbull referred to in  urlLink this article  is the same Charlie Trumbull that was was in  urlLink my fraternity  at  urlLink Dartmouth .

        Pull off Interstate 55 near Cape Girardeau, Mo., and into the drive-through lane of a McDonald's next to the highway and you'll get fast, friendly service, even though the person taking your order is not in the restaurant - or even in Missouri.

        In 1999 the entrepreneurs behind a photo hosting company named Webshots sold their company to Excite@Home for $82.5 million. Not bad. Even better, though, was that a few years later, after Excite@Home went bankrupt, the founders bought Webshots back at an $80 million discount, paying just $2.4 million. That was pretty smart of them... because now, two years later, they've flipped the company again, this time to CNET, for $70 million, $60 million of which is in cold hard cash (they've obviously learned the value). You have to wonder if this agreement has a buy back option as well. While most news stories focusing on the deal are comparing it to Google's similar Picasa purchase yesterday, this bit of yo-yo startup reselling is a much more interesting story.    urlLink Nice

        Performing, you quickly realize there are two types of comics: those who do their set and are normal everyday people afterwards, and those with no off switch. These are the comics to avoid. Their every word comes to you in monologue form, as if they are unable to stop. If one falls down and hurts himself, he can't just tell you that it was painful -- he has to act it out for you, drawing out the story to lamely epic proportions. If he's tired, he can't just say so -- no, he says he feels like "a prostitute after a dental convention." Good luck ending a conversation with a comic like this. Polite nods, bored looks, ordering another drink from the bartender -- none of these behaviors will distract him from his insane desire to play for you.   I've gotten to know several comics in the other group a little better. There's Andrew Orvedahl, with his joke about how it's only kind of okay to pee in the pool if you're actually in the pool. There's Greg Baumhauer, who bemoans the stupidity of a homeless man who tells him he has no place to sleep, offering this response: "Well, if you hadn't ripped up your cardboard box to make that sign, you'd have a place to sleep." There's Brian Hocker, who looks so natural on stage that it seems weird to see him at a place like the Lair. They're all down-to-earth and helpful and willing to tell you what does and doesn't work.   A very funny  urlLink bit in westword  about a first-time comedian in Colorado.

        But Gmail does work just as well as a copy of Outlook Express running on the desktop. In some way, in fact, it works better. This is big news—bigger, in fact, then most people seem to realize.  Until Gmail, practically every Web-based application was a pale imitation of that same application running on a PC. Web-based applications had the advantage that they were accessible from any computer on the Internet on professionally managed servers, that the data was backed up, and that the applications themselves were constantly updated. But compared to applications running on your local machine the web versions had fewer features and performed more slowly. Most users—businesses and consumers alike—were unwilling to make that compromise.    urlLink Read  the entire article from  urlLink Technology Review .
