        urlLink Environmental Integrity Project - Report: Stacking the Deck       Report: Stacking the Deck  Earlier this spring, EPA announced rules limiting the emissions of air toxics from plywood manufacturers and industrial and commercial boilers. But the rule allows facilities to escape those limits if they can demonstrate that their emissions place them in a “low risk” category. A closer look at these loopholes shows how the White House Office of Management and Budget and its political allies at EPA distorted science to minimize risk and maximize the number of plants eligible for the exemptions.

The average collegian graduates with more than $20,000 in debt, headed for a job market where real hourly wages have kept pace with neither inflation nor the cost of living. Young adults are broke in part because of their unprecedented schooling—in the latest census figures, 28 percent of those between 25 and 29 reported holding a bachelor's degree—which promised to pluck them away from the constellation of problems plaguing America's underclass, whether it was trouble with housing or inadequate medical care.    urlLink for more

Ingram     The essential nature of Alzheimer's disease—losing your mind—terrifies everyone who has seen a friend or family member fall to its advance. Alzheimer's disease is devastating, and, despite great strides in recent years, still puzzling in its cause and mechanisms.   Some cases, fortunately few, clearly run in families and strike early; the rest begin later, but show an equally relentless decay of personality. For the minority carrying early-onset Alzheimer's mutations, the genetics are cruel and implacable: If you have inherited one of those genes, you will develop the disease. Yet the great majority of cases do not demonstrate such a clear inheritance pattern. Of this majority, some represent inherited genes that give a higher-than-average chance of developing the disease. Other cases arise in the absence of known genetic risk factors and show no hereditary pattern. What turns these genetic chances into reality? More important, what can we do to stave off the disease once a diagnosis is made?   for more...  urlLink http://www.americanscientist.org/template/AssetDetail/assetid/21886?fulltext=true

In the new study, the scientists found that the protein found in plaques can initiate a process that damages other proteins inside cells and makes them vulnerable to tangling. "This is a new, direct linkage" between plaques and tangles, says Vincent Cryns, who conducted the research with Lester Binder and others at Northwestern University in Illinois.  for more...  urlLink http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993992

The risk was 0.95 (0.70 to 1.29) among short term users (  24 months) users, respectively. The pooled relative risk in the eight studies of aspirin users was 0.87 (0.70 to 1.07).   Conclusions NSAIDs offer some protection against the development of Alzheimer's disease. The appropriate dosage and duration of drug use and the ratios of risk to benefit are still unclear.

Main outcome measure: Alzheimer's disease and dementia at three year follow up.  Results: None of the three instruments was sufficiently predictive of Alzheimer's disease and dementia when administered separately. After participants had been screened for memory complaints and global cognitive impairment, specific tests of word recall and verbal fluency had positive predictive values for dementia of 85-100% (95% confidence intervals range from 62% to 100%). However, only 18% of future dementia cases were identified in the preclinical phase by this three step procedure. Memory complaints were the most sensitive indicator of Alzheimer's disease and dementia in the whole population, but only half the future dementia cases reported memory problems three years before diagnosis.  Conclusion: This three step procedure, which simulates what might occur in clinical practice, has a high positive predictive value for dementia, although only a small number of future cases can be identified.

This is the first of three excerpts we are publishing this month from Jim Hightower's forthcoming book, Thieves In High Places.    There are three things you never want to see:  Water coming out of your electrical sockets.  Flames shooting out of your sock drawer.  A press release coming out of the White House that begins: "The Bush administration today announced revised standards for..."  It doesn’t matter “for what.” When you see that eight-word lead you just know it’s going to be yet another piece of awful news, yet another revision of the rules that’ll let yet another industry or specific corporation have a free hand to clobber us regular folks. From inaugural day forward, the Bush White House has spewed out a torrent of “revised standards,” altering the rules to allow the Powers That Be more leeway to pollute our air and water, restrict our access to health care, invade our privacy, take away our rights on the job, raid our pensions, muffle our freedom of speech, privatize our public resources ... you name it.       The Bush agenda is to disunite America.

      Blowback in Riyadh By William Rivers Pitt t r u t h o u t | Perspective  Thursday 15 May 2003  The compounds were a holdover from the Saudi oil boom of the 1970s, a place where non-Muslims as well as Saudis seeking distance from the hard social rules in Riyadh could have a drink, a place where their wives could wear a swimsuit to the pool without being covered from head to toe. It was a place where you could be a Westerner in the beating heart of Islam, driving distance from Mecca and Medina. The compounds had names ? al Hamra, Vinnell and Eshbiliya ? gated and guarded communities for those doing long-term business in the Saudi capital.  At 11:25pm on Monday night, these protected compounds transformed into the newest battleground in George W. Bush's War on Terror. Gunmen clashed with sentries, hands reached through barriers to slap buttons that opened the gates, and three bomb-laden vehicles roared in to explode themselves and their drivers beside the choicest targets they could find. When it was done, at least eight Americans were among the 29 people dead.  Secretary of State Colin Powell rushed out to proclaim that the attacks had the "earmarks of al Qaeda" due to the fact, he said, that the whole thing was staged with multiple impacts brought home by suicide squads. In fact, the evidence of al Qaeda involvement in this attack is almost beyond doubt.  The spokesman for al Qaeda, Thabet bin Qais, was quoted by reporters on May 7 ? that is one week ago, for the record - as saying, quite bluntly, that Osama bin Laden's forces were gearing up for a series of attacks. The London-based Al-Majalla magazine received an email the day before the attacks from an al Qaeda operative named Abu Mohammed Ablaj. The email described arms the operatives had stored and martyrdom squads that were about to attack. "Beside targeting the heart of America, among the strategic priorities now is to target and execute operations in the Gulf countries and allies of the United States," Ablaj wrote.  American agents on the ground in Saudi Arabia, upon hearing these warnings, tried in vain to get security beefed up around these soft targets. These pleas were ignored until explosions rocked Riyadh.  George W. Bush, speaking at a rally in Indianapolis to promote his tax cut, said, "The United States will find the killers, and they will learn the meaning of American justice."  Does this sound familiar? It should.  The Bush administration was warned many weeks before the 9/11 attacks that Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda were planning to attack prominent American targets with hijacked commercial airplanes. The Egyptian, Israeli, Russian and German intelligence services delivered these warnings in the strongest possible terms. On the home front, FBI officials like Robert Wright, John O'Neill and the officers in the Minnesota branch were screaming that an attack was impending, that we were unprepared, that we were ignoring the blood-obvious facts staring us in the face.  Nothing, but nothing, was done. The explosions came, the bodies dropped, and here we are. This is a microcosm of September 11, right down to the Presidential reaction.  American justice did a bang-up job on the city of Baghdad, and the thousands of Iraqi civilians who were killed, maimed and continue even today to die there can attest to the callous recklessness behind our idea of "Doing What Is Right." Unsurprisingly, the war in Iraq did exactly nothing to make our citizens at home or abroad safer. The eight American corpses who were blown sideways out of their homes in Riyadh are evidence enough of that. In fact, the scene at the compounds in Saudi Arabia proves that our war did, in fact, make the world a more dangerous place.  The CIA calls what happened in Riyadh 'blowback.' There will be more, as promised by Thabet bin Qais, who said al Qaeda had reorganized and was planning attacks against the United States on the scale of September 11. The bloodstains and smoking craters in Riyadh indicate that these guys always keep their promises.  We went to war in Iraq on a number of flawed and blatantly incorrect premises. There is no fearful arsenal of mass destruction weapons; there is no liberty for the Iraqi people; there were no terrorists, nor was there ever a connection between Saddam Hussein and 9/11. To fight this war, we drastically scaled back our operations in Afghanistan ? the new Bush budget has precisely no dollars set aside to pay for operations and democratization/reconstruction there ? and allowed al Qaeda to reassemble in safety. We also alienated the entire global community in the process. We need their help, whether we like it or not, to get the intelligence required to stop these attacks.  "The United States will find the killers, and they will learn the meaning of American justice," said George. Will they learn this meaning the way Osama bin Laden, still alive and free after almost two years, has learned it? Will they learn it the way Saddam Hussein, still alive and free as well, has learned it? Thousands and thousands of Iraqi and Afghan civilians have learned what justice means to George W. Bush. It means a terrible grinding death in the dirt while the real killers get away.  Such a catalog of failure and shame is the Bush administration record to date. They walked away from the Israel/Palestine talks and let that situation turn into a bloody horror. They pointedly ignored a vast array of warnings about impending terror attacks in the summer of 2001 and let that situation turn into the nightmare we currently endure. They fought a war in Afghanistan and walked away before the job was done, allowing the enemy to escape and regroup. They poured vital resources into an Iraq war that did nothing to curb terrorism and did everything to inspire and motivate the terrorists. They passed tax cuts and budgets that steal money from the coffers of Homeland Security ? that means cops and fire fighters and emergency response crews ? to make sure their wealthy friends and corporate sponsors feel well and truly loved.  September 11 did not remove from the earth the concept of right and wrong. It did not redefine the meaning of the words Lie, Steal and Murder. It did not reinvent reality in the way Bush wishes it did. New York Governor George Pataki, at a pro-Iraq-war rally on April 10, said, "The war started here on Sept. 11, 2001." This statement attempted to directly connect the Iraqi civilians who were getting cluster-bombed with the deaths of those 3,000 who perished on that terrible day. This was a lie, a wretched one, promoted for months by the Bush administration and promulgated by mouthpieces like Pataki.  Now, in Riyadh, we see what we have won. We have been awarded courtside seats at the event of the century. George W. Bush and his handlers believe 9/11 granted them the ability to reinvent America and the world according to their own perverted ultra-conservative views. We will be lucky to live through it. If we are smart, we will get rid of these wretches before too many more bombs go off, before too many more people die, before things go past the point of no return, before America is a burned-out hulk crouching in defeat beside history's wide highway.

      The US-lead invasion and occupation of Iraq is illegal  In 1946, the Nuremberg Tribunal judged that "To initiate a war of aggression  is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime  differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the  accumulated evil of the whole."   Consequently, we demand   An immediate end to the illegal occupation of Iraq by the United States and  the United Kingdom and the immediate withdrawal and removal of all foreign  troops, military advisers and representatives, military equipment and  armaments.   We insist that   The Iraqi people have absolute and sovereign right to determine their own  future and any decision about the need for international assistance rests  solely with the Iraqis.   The United States' and United Kingdom's occupation of Iraq is illegal, as is  any administrative authority or interim government established by the  occupying forces. Therefore, any decisions made by the occupying forces or  their representatives are not binding on the Iraqi people.   The UN-held escrow Iraqi oil account must not be used to foot the bill for  reconstruction of the damage caused by the illegal war and UN sanctions. The  funds must be held in trust for the Iraqi people until there is a legitimate  and genuinely representative government elected by the people.   While we strongly support independent civil society assistance to and  solidarity with the Iraqi people, the United Nations and its agencies, other  governments and non-governmental organisations should not serve as a cover  to legitimise, or profit from, the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq.  Humanitarian aid must not be used to support or promote the military,  political and economic objectives of the occupying forces.   The UN, other governments and NGOs should not use their own resources or  public money to replace humanitarian assistance, aid, reconstruction or  other development activities which are the legal and moral responsibility of  the invading and occupying forces, nor should they characterise as "aid"  that which is the entitlement of the Iraqi people.   The Iraqi people have sovereignty over all natural resources and utilities.  The invading and occupying forces or their private sector proxies have no  right to make any decisions about who controls or benefits from the  exploitation of natural resources or the construction and delivery of basic  services and utilities.   The full costs of all reconstruction, compensation and reparations for the  physical, social, economic, psychological, ecological, cultural and heritage  destruction caused by the US-lead invasion of Iraq must be borne by the  aggressors.   Reparations for the physical, social, economic, psychological, ecological,  cultural and heritage loss, damage and suffering caused by the UN Security  Council mandated sanctions must be borne by the Permanent Members of the UN  Security Council.   In addition, reparations must be paid to all persons who have suffered  physical, economic and psychological loss and trauma resulting from twelve  years of sanctions and the 2003 invasion based on individual and collective  claims and dispensed by an independent compensation tribunal.   We call for   A Peoples War Tribunal based on the Geneva Conventions and Nuremberg  Tribunal principles and precedents to investigate and prosecute the war  crimes of, amongst others, George W. Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney,  Paul Wolfowitz, Condoleeza Rice, Colin Powell, Tommy Franks, Tony Blair,  Jack Straw, and John Howard.   International sanctions on the aggressor nations for their illegal,  preemptive attack on a sovereign nation.   The United States Government to desist from threats of force and use of  force against all sovereign nations.

      In response to weijd chung:  The one thing I take issue with is the whole idea that neo-conservatives really care about Freedom of anything besides markets.  I think that countries that give us free markets (means relatively free access by the Us to their resources) are given a free pass with all the other freedoms.  The other freedoms are nice but not sufficient cause for any concern.  Look at the middle east.  We court favor with regimes that place give us our primary object and all the others are just frosting.  They can chose who they want to lead them, but it must be someone "we can work with" or someone who will let us take what we want economically.  I am working on a presentation in the center's series of forum's "Seeking Peace in a Peaceful world" that will focus on what the nature of modern form of imperialism.

         From Weijd Chung To: AL subject: Holy war for Democracy  Here's a link to arguably one of the best, and in my opinion, objective analyses of the the Bush foreign policy. It includes a history of conservative politics and the development of neo-conservative thinking.  http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/EE13Ak02.html  Below is an excerpt of a rather lengthy commentary: ----------------------------------------------------------------------  The war against Iraq was not about oil, or about keeping oil denominated in dollars. These objectives, while not trivial, can be achieved by means other than war. The war was about eliminating the will of any state to defy US global intentions, which neo-conservatives define as faith-based benign hegemony. It was above all a warning of similar fate to all who would be foolish enough to follow the footsteps of the Taliban or Saddam Hussein and stand in the path of America's march toward its strategic objective of establishing a world order based on US imperium through preemptive war.  Taken at face value, the war as explained by the White House is part of a US strategy to spread democracy, to safeguard freedom and to reinstate popular control of national resources and destiny around the world. Americans generally understand democracy to mean a representative form of government based on majority rule with minority rights, administered by elected officials of fixed terms, with separation of powers between the executive, legislative and judiciary branches, and the institution of peaceful change of administrations through general elections. The American notion of freedom focuses on freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of association and freedom to disagree with and oppose government policies through legal means. Associated with these political freedoms are institutions of free enterprise and free markets. Any nation deemed deficient in any of these characteristics is fair game for regime change through the application of overwhelming military superpower, unless it possesses credible counterattack deterrence.  The Bush administration's neo-conservative view of terrorism is that it has become the major threat to US national security. This view is understandable since the September 11, 2001 attacks. Less understandable is its assertion that terrorism is caused by a lack of democracy and freedom associated with domestic oppression, and not by neo-imperialism and the poverty it creates. Curiously, the US domestic recipe for fighting terrorism requires the suspension of civil liberty. Furthermore, terrorists are deemed to be enemies of democracy and freedom.  Thus only half the objective of a preemptive war has to do with the elimination of weapons of mass destruction from the control of "rogue states", the other half has to do with the forceful spread of democracy and freedom around the globe to strike at the root of terrorism. The grand strategy of US neo-conservatism is to bring the full force of US superpower to bear on the crusade to spread democracy and freedom around the world, through regime changes by military force if necessary.  [...]  Thus the failure of the oceans to protect the US from external threat now compels the US to attack all around the world who are not with it in its war on terrorism. It is conceivable that the US can prevail over all other national governments militarily, but it is pure fantasy that the US can spread US-styled democracy and freedom all over the world, even with a new 100-year war. Or that true democracy and freedom around the world would support US national interests. A healthy dose of realism and multiculturalism will save the world from impending self destruction by superpower theocracy. Either way, it spells the end of the age of superpower because military power, as demonstrated in Afghanistan and Iraq, causes more problems than it solves.

      Published on Wednesday, May 14, 2003 by CommonDreams.org  Homeland Security Department Used to Track Texas Democrats  Copyrighted 1997-2003 http://www.commondreams.org/  by Glenn W. Smith   Republicans in Washington and Austin, Texas apparently used a Homeland Security Department agency to track Texas Democratic legislators who left the state to block passage of a GOP-backed Congressional redistricting bill.   This is the same Homeland Security Department that is supposed to be making America safe from foreign terrorists. It's the agency we were told would never be used for domestic political purposes.   But today's edition of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports that the Air and Marine Interdiction and Coordination Center, in Riverside, California, became involved in the Republican search for 51 Democratic state representatives who went to Ardmore, Oklahoma to break a quorum of the House and block action on the redistricting bill.   Here's what the Star-Telegram reported: "The agency received a call to locate a specific Piper turboprop aircraft. It was determined that the plane belonged to former House Speaker Pete Laney." Laney is one of the Democrats who is fighting against the redistricting bill.   The newspaper said, "Laney's plane proved to be a key piece of information because, (Republican House Speaker) Craddick said, it's how he determined that the Democrats were in Ardmore. 'We called someone, and they said they were going to track it. I have no idea how they tracked it down,' Craddick said. 'That's how we found them.'"   The Interdiction and Coordination center "falls under the auspices of the Homeland Security Department," the Star-Telegram reported.   Republican Craddick, at the request of U.S. Rep. Tom DeLay, is pushing a redistricting plan that would eliminate five Democrats from the U.S. Congress. Currently, the Texas delegation contains 17 Democrats and 15 Republicans.   While saying they "called someone," Craddick denied making calls to any federal agency, but DeLay confirmed that Republicans sought the assistance of federal law enforcement.   The action by the House Democrats, dubbed the "Heroes of the House" and the "Killer D's" (a reference to a similar quorum-busting action by Texas Senate Democrats in the late 1970s), has gained national attention. Their action has also received a surprising amount of support from Texas newspapers, which have criticized the deeply partisan actions of Texas Republicans.   Republican leaders in Texas and Washington are furious. They have called the Democrats, holed up in a Holiday Inn in Ardmore, "cowards" and "terrorists."   State troopers have followed the Democrats wives, parents and children. Troopers even staked out a hospital where one lawmaker's premature twins are being cared for. Staffers have been harassed. All this has happened after the location of the Democrats was known.   Now, in a chilling revelation, we discover the Homeland Security Department was apparently used to try and track the Democrats' whereabouts.   It was no doubt a ham-fisted, incautious and bungled attempt (like the Watergate burglary) by Republicans to use all the law enforcement they could find to overcome the Democrats' temporary advantage.   But the use of the Homeland Security Department for partisan political purposes should alarm all Americans. It deserves a full, complete and independent investigation.   The warnings of civil libertarians appear to have been justified. Even if it turns out that some half-crazed Republican staffer or independent investigator called the Air and Marine Interdiction and Coordination Center, it raises disturbing questions about the operations of Homeland Security and the lengths Republicans will go enforce their will.   Americans deserve to know the details of this scandal. And they deserve to know them now.   Glenn W.

      While the only truly pro-peace candidate is Dennis Kicinich (sp?), I still am intrigued by Dean.    I think the media attempt to reinforce Bush by harping on his "support" in the polls and constantly repeating how the democrats have no coherent message is really missing reality.  I think if you listen to the democrats the constant theme of no more bush or as Al Sharpton says "lets get out of the bushes" will ring true.  The toll of 9 candidates saying why Bush is wrong for months on end will have an effect.  The appeal of Bush's campaign of fear will wear off.

      Thursday, May 15, 2003    Dean, the candid candidate, pays visit  Looks like Dean is picking up steam.      By SAM SKOLNIK SEATTLE POST-INTELLIGENCER REPORTER  Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean found a wildly receptive audience last night for his speech to more than 1,200 faithful at Seattle's Town Hall.    The former Vermont governor received several standing ovations from the standing-room-only crowd for his attacks on President Bush.       Dean    "This president's foreign policy is not consistent with our values," Dean said. "Saddam Hussein was a despicable person, but the doctrine of preventative war is going to come back and bite us some day."    Dean, who was introduced by former Washington Gov. Booth Gardner, his honorary state chairman, came in from Portland earlier in the day and did some fund raising before his speech. He leaves Seattle today.    Dean, a medical doctor, is one of nine candidates vying to oppose Bush in the 2004 election. He began the race as a distinct dark horse, but has sharply raised his national profile by being outspoken in his opposition to the Iraq war.    Dean offered lots of red meat to the crowd by shooting at Bush's foreign policy, his economic plan and what he called the president's divisive rhetoric.    He said he took personal offense at the language Bush used in January when he came out against the use of affirmative action by the University of Michigan in its admissions process.    "This president has set us against each other, not just by race," Dean said, but on the basis of religion, gender and socioeconomic status.    In a briefing afterward with reporters, Dean said Bush was not a racist, but that by referring in his speech to the Michigan policy six times as a "quota," a loaded catch phrase for many, "it was the first time he appealed to racial divisiveness -- and that was just wrong."       OAS_AD('Middle2'); //-->    OAS_AD('Middle3'); //--> Dean, up until recently known mostly for his anti-war views, has been branching out on issues. Earlier this week, he proposed an $88.3 billion plan to expand existing health care systems.    His plan also would cut tax breaks for corporations that don't provide health insurance to workers.    Although many of Dean's stances are seen by supporters and detractors as tilted toward the liberal end of the Democratic Party spectrum, he told reporters he didn't believe his more conservative views on gun control would hurt his chances among Democratic primary voters.    While Dean, 54, said he supported the assault weapons ban and the Brady Law, and that he is in favor of closing the "gun-show loophole," a federal check for buyers at gun shows, he said other gun-control policies should be left up to the states.    He said he didn't believe that tougher gun-control policies that may be well suited for Seattle or New York would work -- or should be forcibly enacted -- in rural states such as Wyoming or Vermont "because they don't need it."    Rachel Jackson, who recently moved from Missouri to Seattle with her husband, said she had liked what she had heard about Dean but was won over by his speech and is now a committed supporter.    "He's the most eloquent speaker that I've seen," said Jackson, 26.    Dean, who has been rapped by his detractors for possessing sharp campaign-trail elbows, avoided directly criticizing his primary opponents last night. But if anything, he said his plain-spokenness should be seen as a virtue.    "You will never leave a room without knowing where I stand on an issue," he said. "You may not agree with me, but you'll know."    P-I reporter Sam Skolnik can be reached at 206-448-8176 or samskolnik@seattlepi.com

      What a great begining!  The forum was all that we dreamed it could be: thoughful, stimulating, engaging, and comapssionate.  Terry urged us to not only be "against" the Bush Administration's war plans, but be "for" true liberation for all.  That means we need to stand against those who would use religion or culture to enslave some (women, racial or religious minorities, gay/lesbian/transgendered)to benefit of the few.  Bringing troops home will not give anyone freedom.  We need not to demand that all live up to the ideals of free self determining human beings. Lets take back the term liberation and use it in its true deep sense and refuse to acknowledge perversions of the term to meet short term political ends.

      Thoughts on Women in Afghanistan: liberation or continued oppression.  Thanks to Terry for the well researched presentation.  The story of RAWA-Revolutionary Association of Women in Afghanistan is one of courage and strength in the face of oppression from without and within.  The story is one of seeking true freedom and equality from within.  Some would have us believe that only the US can give freedom to the world.  All other places, especially in the middle east are incapable of self government, because they lack basic understanding of what democracy and freedom really mean.  RAWA demonstrates the lie.  We need to take the lesson to heart:  there are people in every country who understands what self government means.   Lets demand that our foreign policy reflect that fact.

      from Thom Holcomb  Is the whole "Saving Private Lynch" story  just another Hollywood Movie made for TV with help from a fraudulent Administration? Read this article from Motherjones and see what you think:   urlLink http://www.motherjones.com/news/warwatch/2003/21/we_419_04.html   Reporting on Private Lynch  The New York Times has been busy with the Jayson Blair scandal, lately, but maybe they should be paying attention to larger issues. One of Blair's fabrications related to Private Jessica Lynch -- Blair made up interviews and described tobacco fields around a house he had never seen. But that was a minor detail in the Lynch saga. Scores of other reporters, editors and producers helped generate the storm of hype around Lynch's dramatic rescue.  Now, according to reports by the Toronto Sunday Star, the Guardian and the BBC, it seems that Lynch's rescue may have been staged especially for those high-tech night cameras the special forces were carrying during the mission. Jayson Blair is cause for concern at The New York Times, but the BBC's report should have the rest of the American media doing some soul searching about the coverage of this war.  Lynch's story provided the Pentagon with heroes and happy news, just when the war was proving more difficult than the Bush administration had originally hoped. The grainy green night footage showed Army Rangers and Navy Seals busting into a hospital with guns drawn and whisking a stunned-looking Lynch away in a helicopter. A brave Iraqi laywer, Mohammed Odeh al-Rehaief, supposedly tipped off the Americans to Lynch's location. "Daring!" "Heroic!" the headlines blared. The first reports claimed that Lynch had fought for her life, that she had bullet wounds, that she had been mistreated and possibly tortured at the Iraqi hospital.  But now, in a scathing indictment of both the Pentagon's willingess to stage manage facts and the American media's willingness to applaud the show, a BBC documentary has called most of the details of the original story into question. Reporter John Kampfner calls the entire rescue "one of the most stunning pieces of news management ever conceived.":  Witnesses told us that the special forces knew that the Iraqi military had fled a day before they swooped on the hospital. "We were surprised. Why do this? There was no military, there were no soldiers in the hospital," said Dr Anmar Uday, who worked at the hospital.  "It was like a Hollywood film. They cried 'go, go, go', with guns and blanks without bullets, blanks and the sound of explosions. They made a show for the American attack on the hospital - action movies like Sylvester Stallone or Jackie Chan."  There was one more twist. Two days before the snatch squad arrived, Harith had arranged to deliver Jessica to the Americans in an ambulance.  But as the ambulance, with Private Lynch inside, approached a checkpoint American troops opened fire, forcing it to flee back to the hospital. The Americans had almost killed their prize catch.  (The BBC also notes that Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer of Top Gun fame, has been advising the Pentagon since the war in Afghanistan ...)  No reporters seem to have questioned the Pentagon's official narrative, nor asked, as the BBC did, for the unedited version of the videotape that the Pentagon was handing out. The original New York Times report on April 5 read:  "Muhammad ultimately contacted American marines in Iraq, pointing out the exact room where Private Lynch was being held, and around midnight on Tuesday April 1, marines launched an attack on the nearby Baath Party headquarters while Army Rangers secured the hospital grounds and Navy SEALS raced into rescue Private Lynch. There were firefights to get into the building, and firefights to get out, according to Brig. Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, the spokesman for the United States Central Command headquarters, in Doha, Qatar. Members of the strike force who stayed behind found ammunition, maps and a terrain model in the basement of the hospital. General Brooks said that was proof the Iraqis are using civilian facilities to disguise and protect military installations. By Wednesday morning, marines seized the hospital under light sniper fire. Civilian patients and medical staff members emerged with hands raised."  Jayson Blair provided "additional reporting" for that story. His contribution proved entirely fictitious. Presumably, all of the other reporters at least travelled to their reported locations. But given how much of this story may have been debunked, were any of them asking the Pentagon the tough questions? Were any of them skeptical enough of the made-for-Meg Ryan narrative being handed to them?  Most of America probably still believes that Jessica Lynch fought for her life, was terribly wounded, possibly even tortured and then saved by a heroic Iraqi lawyer and brave Navy Seals. In truth, the British report indicates that Jessica Lynch's unit took a wrong turn, she was terribly injured in a car wreck, and taken to a hospital where Iraqi doctors treated her and then actually tried to get her back to American troops.  White House spokesman Ari Fleischer is declining comment. The Iraqi lawyer Mohammed, a primary source for the version of the story where Lynch was mistreated and saved, has a cushy job with a Republican lobbying organization and a $300,000 book contract, so he has to stick to his guns. At the Pentagon, it's bluster as usual. Spokesman Bryan Whitman called any accusations of stage management "void of all facts and absolutely ridiculous," but included this healthy dose of backpedaling:  "'We don't want to take unnecessary risk. We do make sure that when we exercise military force we use the right resources, sufficient to get the job done. It is a decision made by the commander on the ground,' Mr Whitman told CNN.  He also said that the US military never claimed that the troops came under fire when they burst into the hospital, but that troops supporting the mission exchanged fire nearby.  Speculative reports in the media were responsible for some of the misinformation, not Pentagon statements, he added.  'The Pentagon never released an account of what happened to Lynch because it didn't have an account. She never told us,' Mr Whitman added."  We may never know all of the details of what happened to Private Jessica Lynch. But the fact remains that it was British and Canadian outlets that broke this story. And Kampfner at the BBC doesn't think that's a coincidence. CNN asked Kampfner whether British officials themselves were worried about the Pentagon's presentation of information, and Kampfner said:  "Well, I mean, it must be said the British are no more angels than the Americans when it comes to putting out certain messages in the war. The British were worried about the Lynch episode, but they saw this more in general terms. They were worried about the entire U.S. media operation.  Forget Blair, and forget his race. What are the rest of America's reporters doing?

      email from  Thom Holcomb  Peeps,  Does anyone have information on Citizen Police Review Boards? If so, please forward the info to the list or to me so I can pass it on.  I received an email from a poet friend of mine, J'malo, who lives in North Memphis. It reads:   --  --  --  --  -- Quoting the late great Malcolm X, "Anything below the Canadian border is the Ol' Dirty South". Apparently that statement stills holds true in 2003. In America it is still legal to lynch Black Men. The death of Mr. Keith Harris should not only be appalling to the Black community, but to the entire nation as a whole. According to one report Mr. Harris ran into a wooded area and shots were fired, no-one knows who shot first. Another report states that no gun was found. Another report reads that a gun was found in the area. Then it was said that Mr. Harris killed himself, which LIE is the truth? Unfortunately Keith Harris is dead, he can not defend himself. So more than likely the guilty officers will not be brought up on charges of murder because the star witness is dead, just like the case of 17 year old Rodie Gossett who was killed by a "mushy trigger" at the hands of Peter Nicholson. These hate crimes can no longer be allowed to occur!! When Reginald Rome defended his home against who he thought were burglars, he was charged with murder and will stand trial for the death penalty. But those with a badge have a state given right to murder Black Men at any given moment. The entire community was upset when a police officer shot a dog, but little is said when Black Men are assassinated by police. The rest of the community had best to take notes. When one man is in bondage, no man is free.  --  --  --  --  --  J'malo went to school with Keith, and Keith came out to see J'malo perform at Africa in April. For some of us, police violence, unchecked murders by the police represents an injustice, an issue, something we speak out against - for others, it is a life danger - a tragedy that is a potential reality any day of the week.  Originally, I spoke with Steve Tammelleo about kicking off our embrace of other peace and justice issues with some commentary from the folks working to right the wrongs of environmental racism in Memphis. After reading J'malo's letter, I have asked J'malo to speak for 10 minutes or so at the next Poetry Not Bombs, Saturday, June 14, 8 PM on police violence against citizens of Memphis.  Some of you have seen J'malo perform - he writes, directs and acts in plays, he performs poetry and hosts a monthly poetry open mike, he can be seen singing at top notch Memphis clubs (like Isaac Hayes' joint) and he volunteers much time to work with the youth in his neighborhood and at other schools. Not only that, he works a full time job in a cubicle. He is articulate, gracious and a true "Dirty South Soldier" (more along the lines of Malcolm X and less along the lines of what you might hear on Hot 107.1 FM)  In the months to come, we hope to line up speakers and performers to address certain issues and to update us on particular actions and/or organizations working to bring peace and justice to Memphis and the Mid-South. Your suggestions and comments are always welcome.  I hope you'll mark your calendars and join us for another Poetry Not Bombs at the One Love Organic Juice Bar & Soulful Vegetarian Cafe!

      Senators Sharply Criticize Iraq Rebuilding Efforts  By ERIC SCHMITT  ASHINGTON, May 22  Democratic senators assailed the Bush administration's postwar reconstruction effort in Iraq today, peppering Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz with complaints about the planning and execution of the strategy. Even Republicans joined in, offering pointed criticisms of the administration's performance.   Lawmakers have been stewing for weeks over the administration's failure to consult in depth with Congress about the costs, methods and goals of rebuilding Iraq, and some of those frustrations boiled over at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.   The concerns from lawmakers underscored the challenges facing the administration not only in Iraq, but also in maintaining support in Congress, allied capitals and among the American public for the difficult and dangerous postwar mission.   "I am concerned that the administration's initial stabilization and reconstruction efforts have been inadequate," said Senator Richard G. Lugar, an Indiana Republican who heads the committee. "The planning for peace was much less developed than the planning for war." Mr. Lugar said the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq could take at least five years.  In a particularly testy exchange, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, the panel's senior Democrat, berated Mr. Wolfowitz for the administration's failure to acknowledge publicly that the postwar efforts would cost billions of dollars, require years of involvement and get the United States bogged down just as it is in the Balkans.   "When is the president going to tell the American people that we're likely to be in the country of Iraq for three, four, five, six, eight, 10 years, with thousands of forces and spending billions of dollars? Because it's not been told to them yet." Mr. Biden said. "I don't know about you, but home constituency doesn't understand that. They think Johnny and Jane are going to come marching home pretty soon."   Mr. Wolfowitz said the pace of reconstruction was hard to predict. "It's possible that things will go faster," he said.   When he tried to discuss Iraq's resources for rebuilding the country  notably its enormous oil fields  Mr. Biden cut him off.   "What are the resources?" Mr. Biden demanded. "For us just to get to the point where we're talking about increasing to 1 million barrels per day export, there's going to be a need for a $5 billion investment in the oil fields to get to that point."   In his opening statement, Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledged that security, especially in Baghdad, was still a problem, but he said that media reports of looting, lawlessness and violence in the Iraqi capital overlooked improving conditions there and in other Iraqi cities.   He reaffirmed the administration's long-term commitment to rebuilding Iraq, and ticked off a list of initial successes, from the availability of electricity in Basra all day long for the first time in 12 years, to the reopening of primary schools throughout Iraq.   "We cannot afford to fail," Mr. Wolfowitz told the senators. "We cannot afford to allow Iraq to revert to the remnants of the Baathist regime that now ranges throughout Iraq in their desperate bid for influence and power."   But even as he sought understanding for the difficulties confronting a monumental rebuilding task that has been under way for only a month or so, Mr. Wolfowitz was greeted with skepticism from many senators.   Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, said in a statement that "we may have underestimated or mischaracterized the challenges of establishing security and rebuilding Iraq."   Democrats were far more punishing in their assessments.  "It is very hard to fathom what the administration's strategy is with respect to the immediate stabilization of the situation, let alone the longer-term reconstruction of Iraq," Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said in a statement.   Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, accused the administration of squandering a well executed military campaign with "a half-baked plan for reconstruction."   "Answers from the administration about the scope of the job, and the likely requirements in terms of U.S. manpower, resources and time, remain vague at best," he said in a statement.   Mr. Wolfowitz acknowledged that the administration misjudged how quickly qualified Iraqi police officers could be trained and assigned to duty and that Pentagon officials erred by not having Jay Garner, the first civilian administrator, brief lawmakers more fully before leaving for the Persian Gulf in March. Otherwise, Mr. Wolfowitz gave a spirited defense of the Pentagon's planning for the war's aftermath.  He said he stood by his criticism of Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, the Army chief of staff, who suggested in February that it could take "something on the order of several hundred thousand soldiers" to stabilize Iraq. Mr. Wolfowitz said he interpreted that to mean 300,000 troops or more, and the Pentagon did not envision needing that many.   Gen. Peter Pace, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who joined Mr. Wolfowitz, said there were 145,000 American troops in Iraq with 18,000 more from the Army's First Armored Division on the way. Beyond that, General Pace said, there are no plans to increase American force levels. There are also about 20,000 British troops in Iraq.   Mr. Wolfowitz also defended a decision by L. Paul Bremer III, the new civilian administrator, to delay the selection of an interim civilian Iraqi authority until security improved and American officials took more time to vet Iraqi representatives.   "If the situation in Iraq is somewhat messy now," he said, "it's likely to seem even messier as Iraqis sort out their political process."   _________________________ "To announce that there must be  no criticism  of the president, or that  we are to stand by the president right or wrong, is not only  unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public." Republican President THEODORE ROOSEVELT      Knights of the Socially Conscious

      Depleted Uranian in Iraq  Remains of toxic bullets Litter Iraq  http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0515/p01s02-woiq.html  The Monitor finds high levels of radiation left by US armor-piercing shells.  By Scott Peterson | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor   BAGHDAD  At a roadside produce stand on the outskirts of Baghdad, business is brisk for Latifa Khalaf Hamid. Iraqi drivers pull up and snap up fresh bunches of parsley, mint leaves, dill, and onion stalks.  But Ms. Hamid's stand is just four paces away from a burnt-out Iraqi tank, destroyed by - and contaminated with - controversial American depleted-uranium (DU) bullets. Local children play "throughout the day" on the tank, Hamid says, and on another one across the road.

They gather around as a Geiger counter carried by a visiting reporter starts singing when it nears a DU bullet fragment no bigger than a pencil eraser. It registers nearly 1,000 times normal background radiation levels on the digital readout.  The Monitor visited four sites in the city - including two randomly chosen destroyed Iraqi armored vehicles, a clutch of burned American ammunition trucks, and the downtown planning ministry - and found significant levels of radioactive contamination from the US battle for Baghdad.  In the first partial Pentagon disclosure of the amount of DU used in Iraq, a US Central Command spokesman told the Monitor that A-10 Warthog aircraft - the same planes that shot at the Iraqi planning ministry - fired 300,000 bullets. The normal combat mix for these 30-mm rounds is five DU bullets to 1 - a mix that would have left about 75 tons of DU in Iraq.  The Monitor saw only one site where US troops had put up handwritten warnings in Arabic for Iraqis to stay away. There, a 3-foot-long DU dart from a 120 mm tank shell, was found producing radiation at more than 1,300 times background levels. It made the instrument's staccato bursts turn into a steady whine.  "If you have pieces or even whole [DU] penetrators around, this is not an acute health hazard, but it is for sure above radiation protection dose levels," says Werner Burkart, the German deputy director general for Nuclear Sciences and Applications at the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in Vienna. "The important thing in any battlefield - especially in populated urban areas - is somebody has to clean up these sites."  Minimizing the risk  Fresh-from-the-factory DU tank shells are normally handled with gloves, to minimize the health risk, and shielded with a thin coating. The alpha particle radiation emitted by DU travels less than an inch and can be stopped by cloth or even tissue paper. But when the DUmaterial burns (usually on impact; or as a dust, it can spontaneously ignite) protective shields disappear, and dangerous radioactive oxides are created that can be inhaled or ingested.  "[The risk] depends so very much on how you handle it," says Jan Olof Snihs, of Sweden's Radiation Protection Authority in Stockholm. In most cases dangers are low, he says, unless children eat toxic and radioactive soil, or get DU oxides on their hands.  Radioactive particles are a "special risk associated with a war," Mr. Snihs says. "The authorities should be aware of this, and try to decontaminate places like this, just to avoid unnecessary risk."  Pentagon officials say that DU is relatively harmless and a necessary part of modern warfare. They say that pre-Gulf War studies that indicated a risk of cancer and of causing harm to local populations through permanent contamination have been superseded by newer reports.  "There is not really any danger, at least that we know about, for the people of Iraq," said Lt. Col. Michael Sigmon, deputy surgeon for the US Army's V Corps, told journalists in Baghdad last week. He asserted that children playing with expended tank shells would have to eat and then practically suffocate on DU residue to cause harm.  But there is a growing chorus of concern among United Nations and relief officials, along with some Western scientific experts, who are calling for sites contaminated with DU be marked off and made safe.  "The soil around the impact sites of [DU] penetrators may be heavily contaminated, and could be harmful if swallowed by children," says Brian Spratt, chair of the working group on DU at The Royal Society, Britain's premier scientific institution.  Heavy metal toys?  Fragments and penetrators should be removed, since "children find them fascinating objects, and can pocket them," says Professor Spratt. "The science says there is some danger - not perhaps a huge danger - of these objects. ... We certainly do not say that these things are safe; we say that cleanup is important."  The British Ministry of Defense says it will offer screening to soldiers suspected of DU exposure, and will publish details about locations and quantities of DU that British troops used in Iraq - a tiny fraction of that fired by US forces.  The Pentagon has traditionally been tight-lipped about DU: Official figures on the amount used were not released for years after the 1991 Gulf War and Bosnia conflicts, and nearly a year after the 1999 Kosovo campaign. No US official contacted could provide DU use estimates from the latest war in Iraq.  "The first thing we should ask [the US military] is to remove that immediately," says Carel de Rooy, head of the UN Children's Fund in Baghdad, adding that senior UN officials need urgent advice on avoiding exposure.  The UN Environment Program last month called for field tests. DU "is still an issue of great concern for the general public," said UNEP chief Klaus Tpfer. "An early study in Iraq could either lay these fears to rest or confirm that there are indeed potential risks."  US troops avoid wreckage  During the latest Iraq conflict Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles and A-10 Warthog aircraft, among other military platforms, all fired the DU bullets from desert war zones to the heart of Baghdad. No other armor-piercing round is as effective against enemy tanks. While the Pentagon says there's no risk to Baghdad residents, US soldiers are taking their own precautions in Iraq, and in some cases have handed out warning leaflets and put up signs.  "After we shoot something with DU, we're not supposed to go around it, due to the fact that it could cause cancer," says a sergeant in Baghdad from New York, assigned to a Bradley, who asked not to be further identified.  "We don't know the effects of what it could do," says the sergeant. "If one of our vehicles burnt with a DU round inside, or an ammo truck, we wouldn't go near it, even if it had important documents inside. We play it safe."  Six American vehicles struck with DU "friendly fire" in 1991 were deemed to be too contaminated to take home, and were buried in Saudi Arabia. Of 16 more brought back to a purpose-built facility in South Carolina, six had to be buried in a low-level radioactive waste dump.  Television footage of the war last month showed Iraqi armored vehicles burning as US columns drove by, a common sign of a strike by DU, which burns through armor on impact, and often ignites the ammunition carried by the targeted vehicle.  "We were buttoned up when we drove by that - all our hatches were closed," the US sergeant says. "If we saw anything on fire, we wouldn't stop anywhere near it. We would just keep on driving."  That's an option that produce seller Hamid doesn't have.  She says the US broke its promise not to bomb civilians. She has found US cluster bomblets in her garden; the DU is just another dangerous burden, in a war about which she remains skeptical.  "We were told it was going to be paradise [when Saddam Hussein was toppled], and now they are killing our children," she says voicing a common Iraqi perception about the risk of DU. "The Americans did not bother to warn us that this is a contaminated area."  There is a warning now at the Doura intersection on the southern outskirts of Baghdad. In the days before the capital fell, four US supply trucks clustered near an array of highway off-ramps caught fire, cooking off a number of DU tank rounds.  American troops wearing facemasks for protection arrived a few days later and bulldozed the topsoil around the site to limit the contamination.  The troops taped handwritten warning signs in Arabic to the burned vehicles, which read: "Danger - Get away from this area." These were the only warnings seen by this reporter among dozens of destroyed Iraqi armored vehicles littering the city.  "All of them were wearing masks," says Abbas Mohsin, a teenage cousin of a drink seller 50 yards away, said referring to the US military cleanup crew. "They told the people there were toxic materials ... and advised my cousin not to sell Pepsi and soft drinks in this area. They said they were concerned for our safety."  Despite the troops' bulldozing of contaminated earth away from the burnt vehicles, black piles of pure DU ash and particles are still present at the site. The toxic residue, if inhaled or ingested, is considered by scientists to be the most dangerous form of DU.  One pile of jet-black dust yielded a digital readout of 9,839 radioactive emissions in one minute, more than 300 times average background levels registered by the Geiger counter. Another pile of dust reached 11,585 emissions in a minute.  Western journalists who spent a night nearby on April 10, the day after Baghdad fell, were warned by US soldiers not to cross the road to this site, because bodies and unexploded ordnance remained, along with DU contamination. It was here that the Monitor found the "hot" DU tank round.  This burned dart pushed the radiation meter to the far edge of the "red zone" limit.  A similar DU tank round recovered in Saudi Arabia in 1991, that was found by a US Army radiological team to be emitting 260 to 270 millirads of radiation per hour. Their safety memo noted that the "current [US Nuclear Regulatory Commission] limit for non-radiation workers is 100 millirads per year."  The normal public dose limit in the US, and recognized around much of the world, is 100 millirems per year. Nuclear workers have guidelines 20 to 30 times as high as that.  The depleted-uranium bullets are made of low-level radioactive nuclear-waste material, left over from the making of nuclear fuel and weapons. It is 1.7 times as dense as lead, and burns its way easily through armor. But it is controversial because it leaves a trail of contamination that has half-life of 4.5 billion years - the age of our solar system.  Next: Less DU in this war?  http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0515/p01s02-woiq.html

As we lurch from crisis to crisis, beamed directly into our brains by   satellite TV, we have to think on our feet. On the move. We enter historie      through the rubble of war. Ruined cities, parched fields, shrinking  forests, and dying rivers are our archives. Craters left by daisy cutters,   our libraries.             So what can I offer you tonight? Some uncomfortable thoughts about money,            war, empire, racism, and democracy. Some worries that flit around my            brain like a family of persistent moths that keep me awake at night.             Some of you will think it bad manners for a person like me, officially            entered in the Big Book of Modern Nations as an "Indian citizen,"            to come here and criticize the U.S. government. Speaking for myself,            I'm no flag-waver, no patriot, and am fully aware that venality, brutality,            and hypocrisy are imprinted on the leaden soul of every state. But when            a country ceases to be merely a country and becomes an empire, then            the scale of operations changes dramatically. So may I clarify that            tonight I speak as a subject of the American Empire? I speak as a slave            who presumes to criticize her king.              Since lectures must be called something, mine tonight is called:            Instant-Mix Imperial Democracy (Buy One, Get One Free).

      Starting a Progressive Counterpart to the Neocon's Most Powerful Weapon-- the Policy Creation and Advocacy Think Tank; Join the Grassroots Effort to Build One  Rob Kall   Think of the neocon think tanks as machine guns, spraying neoncon bullets of ideas, persuasion and influence. Theyve been building these Political Weapons for over 20 years. The Democrats and the progressive left dont have a clue. Theyre still fighting with bows and arrows. The progressive think tanks (TTs) just dont do what the right wing think tanks do. The progressive TTs focus on specific issues and work towards advocacy on those issues. They get their funding based on those issues and that keeps the left unfocused, disorganized, without a clear, easy to understand and, more important, express, embrace and enthusiastically get behind.   The left is fighting with obsolete weapons. The question is no longer why. Poor leadership, selling out to corporatism and the middle, failure to see the power and effectiveness, the huge leap in political technology that the neocon think tanks represent all add up to the current situation where the cave men are fighting the marines. Its that stark a difference and it is time that we do something about it.   Theres been talk that John Podesta, president Clintons last chief of staff,  is doing something along these lines, called the American Majority Institute. It was announced last fall. If he is doing it, then its VERY low on the radar. Try Googling it, or what is apparently its fundraising counterpart, the American Majority Fund, which involved Harold Ickes and Morton H. Halperin. But it is also very low on the radar. In their early stages, that may be where they want to stay for a while.   Even if Podesta, Ickes and Halperin have their funded started and under way, there's still room for, perhaps need for another one. There are at least five major right wing TTs. it will probably be necessary to start at least ten TTs to end up with five strong, effective ones ten years from now.  Why not start one from the grass roots? The progressive movement is one of the people, not of the powerful. Why not start a progressive TT that is built from the bottom up? Look at what moveon has done from such small beginnings. Already there are a handful of us working on this project. Soon, we'll list some of the recognizable names who have committed. In the meantime, we can use help fleshing out the territory. Drop me a line and we'll put you to work. This project is going to take a lot of money. Right this minute, we are building the framework. We need someone to come up with the first $1000-$1500 it will take to appply for a 501 C3 not profit status. And then, we'll need millions more. The strongest rightwing TTs operate on $15-$25 million a year. Compare that with under $5 million for most progressive TTs. The strongest TTs have assets that can approach a quarter billion dollars or more.   But we have to start somewhere. Here's a clearer picture of what the rightwing TTs do.   The Republicans stole the presidency with the help of Supreme Court Judges influenced by decades of Right wing neocon think tank influence.   The mid-term elections were won using Policy and Platform positions created and fine tuned by neocon think tanks.   The right wing talk shows are fed propaganda and talking points by the neocon think tanks.   The right wing fundmentalist religious groups are presented with talking point presentations of neocon think tank material to persuade them to get behind neocon think tank policies.   The neocons have created organizations to bring college students into the neocon world.   The neocon think tanks provide research for thousands of state level republican legislators. Theyve also created an organization that supports them.   The neocon think tanks have recording studios in their Washington offices so their high name recognition spokespeople can be more easily interviewed by visiting media.   The neocon think tanks generate hundreds of OpEd articles to be fed to mainstream media.   The neocon think tanks sponsor educational seminars for right wing judgesholding them in vacation locations. The goal is to get the judges to see cases through the perspective of the neocon philosophy.   Okay. So you want to help build, for the progressive movement, a weapon like the one the Republicans have used to decimate democrats, progressives, democracy, the environment, human rights.. the policy think tank?   Here are a few ways you can help:   1) Do some research on the Right wing think tanks. Assemble a list. Off the top of my head, they include PNAC, American Enterprise Institute, Cato Foundation I need to get a complete list of the top five or ten, and remember them. I think theres one that is the Manhattan Inst.   Anyway, dig into their websites. Identify what they do, how they promote their policies and positions. We need a complete list of all the strategies they use.   2) Dig up research on the neocon think tankslets assemble a comprehensive collection of links to good articles and reports, like weve started to do on the PNAC Watch .   3) Identify left wing, liberal, progressive organizations that operate as think tanks, that are funding sourcesFoundations, individual contributors Potential contributors to our project once its further along.   4) Suggest names of potential members of the think tank. We need administrators, organizers, researchers, writers.. I am starting with columnists because it takes columnists to communicate the ideas and get them published. But we need to identify all kinds of people. Look at the list of people in the PNAC and use them as examples.     5) Help raise money. Think of fund raising ideas. Do you know someone who could be a major contributor? Do you know someone who knows someone. I just spoke to someone today who knows the music instructor for a well known philanthropist.  6) At the least, just drop us a note that you support what we're doing, with permission to add the note to our blurbs. Encouragement goes a long way.  We will build a weapon to fight the right at an equal technology level. And we will win. There are more democrats and greens than there are Republicans. And we have one secret weapon they will never own... hearts.

      First Comprehensive Report Finds Most Democratic Presidential Candidates Reflecting - Not Leading - Public Opinion on Gay Issues Gay Vote Represents Close to 10% of the Vote in Democratic Primaries      WASHINGTON - May 28 - The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force (NGLTF) Policy Institute today released the first comprehensive report of the positions of the 2004 Democratic Presidential candidates on key gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender (GLBT) issues. The 2004 Democratic Presidential Candidates on Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender Issues finds that while the candidates - as a group - hold the most pro-GLBT positions ever taken by a field of candidates for President, the majority are not leading but reflecting public opinion.  "Contrary to assertions of conservative pundits, it's clear that the Democratic candidates cannot be accused of 'pandering' to the gay community," said Matt Foreman, NGLTF Executive Director. "By and large, their positions aren't 'leading' the fight for equal rights, they simply reflect the overwhelming opinion of the American public."    http://www.ngltf.org/library/index.cfm urlLink     urlLink http://www.commondreams.org/news2003/0528-05.htm

      This may be the smoking gun that could sink the bushes...lieing about sept 11th..   AMONG THE PORTIONS of the report the administration refuses to declassify, sources say, are chapters dealing with two politically and diplomatically sensitive issues: the details of daily intelligence briefings given to Bush in the summer of 2001 and evidence pointing to Saudi government ties to Al Qaeda.  [...]  One document is called the PDB, the Presidents Daily Brief. The congressional report contains details of PDBs provided to Bush (and top national- security aides) prior to 9-11. The PDBs included warnings about possible attacks by Al Qaeda. (One PDB was given at the presidential ranch in Crawford, Texas, on Aug. 6, and dealt with the possibility that Al Qaeda might hijack airplanes.)  http://www.msnbc.com/news/917942.asp

      more lies...did they say anything true?...  No Bunker where U.S. Bombs Targeted Saddam-CBS  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Baghdad bunker which the United States said it bombed on the opening night of the Iraq (news - web sites) war in a bid to kill Saddam Hussein (news - web sites) never existed, CBS Evening News reported Wednesday.  The network quoted a U.S. Army colonel in charge of inspecting key sites in Baghdad as saying no trace of a bunker or of bodies had been found at the site on the southern outskirts of the Iraqi capital, known as Dora Farms.  "When we came out here, the primary thing they were looking for was an underground facility, or bodies, forensics, and basically, what they saw was giant holes created. No underground facilities, no bodies," Col. Tim Madere said.  CBS, saying it was the first news organization to visit the site, reported that the CIA (news - web sites) had searched it once and Col. Madere had searched it twice as part of efforts to find traces of DNA that could indicate if Saddam or his sons had been killed or wounded.  The network said the main palace in the compound remained standing despite the surrounding destruction. It quoted Madere as saying anyone who had been in the building could have survived the raid.  Shortly after the attack, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld told reporters: "There's no question but that the strike on that leadership headquarters was successful. We have photographs of what took place. The question is, what was in there?"  The United States effectively acknowledged that the March 20 raid failed to kill Saddam when it launched a second air attack aimed at the Iraqi president on April 7.  The fate of Saddam and his sons Uday and Qusay is still unclear.  Rumsfeld said earlier this month, "If you don't have evidence he's dead, you've probably got to assume he's alive." ___________________________________ http://mailman.lbo-talk.org/mailman/listinfo/lbo-talk

       [This stuff gets more surreal every day. Via Sam Smith's Progressive Review.]     A PIPA-Knowledge Networks poll finds that 68% continue to approve of the decision to go to war with Iraq. However, only 50% said that they were somewhat (29%) or very (21%) certain that "when the US government presented the evidence to justify going to war with Iraq, it was. . . not being misleading." Another 5% said they were not very certain. . . Steven Kull, director of PIPA comments, "Enthusiasm about the success of the war may be offset by the failure to find evidence of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction or links to al' Qaeda."  Kull continues, "For some Americans, their desire to support the war may be leading them to screen out information that weapons of mass destruction have not been found." While 59% of those polled correctly said the US has not found Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, 41% said they believed that the US has found such weapons (34%) or were unsure (7%).  While 69% correctly said that Iraq had not used chemical or biological weapons in the war, 31% said they believed Iraq had (22%) or were unsure (9%).  Kull adds, "Given the intensive news coverage and high levels of public attention to the topic, this level of misinformation suggests that some Americans may be avoiding having an experience of cognitive dissonance." ___________________________________ http://mailman.lbo-talk.org/mailman/listinfo/lbo-talk

       Iraqi Weapons Only One Reason for War-Wolfowitz  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The U.S. decision to stress the threat posed by Iraq (news - web sites)'s supposed weapons of mass destruction above all others was taken for "bureaucratic" reasons to justify the war, U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz was quoted as saying in remarks released on Wednesday.  Wolfowitz, seen as one of the most hawkish figures in the Bush administration's policy on Iraq, said President Saddam Hussein (news - web sites)'s alleged cache of chemical, biological and possibly nuclear weapons was merely one of several reasons behind the decision to go to war.  "For bureaucratic reasons, we settled on one issue, weapons of mass destruction, because it was the one reason everyone could agree on," Wolfowitz was quoted as saying in Vanity Fair magazine's July issue.  No chemical or biological weapons have been found in Iraq despite repeated assertions by President Bush (news - web sites) and British Prime Minister Tony Blair (news - web sites) before the March 20 invasion that the threat posed by Saddam's vast stocks of banned weapons warranted a war to eliminate them.  The United Nations (news - web sites) and America's allies were not convinced by the argument that it was justification for a war, which was launched amid protests in many world capitals. Washington's ties were major allies France and Germany are still strained.  Wolfowitz said another reason for the invasion had been "almost unnoticed but huge" -- namely that the ousting of Saddam would allow the United States to remove its troops from Saudi Arabia, where their presence had long been a major al Qaeda grievance.  "Just lifting that burden from the Saudis is itself going to open the door" to a more peaceful Middle East, Wolfowitz was quoted as saying.  The magazine said he made the remarks days before suicide bombings, attributed to al Qaeda, against Western targets in Riyadh and Casablanca two weeks ago that killed 75 people.  The United States announced last month that it was ending military operations in Saudi Arabia, where they have long generated Arab resentment because of their proximity to Islam's holiest sites.  Wolfowitz's remarks were released a day after Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, seeking to explain why no weapons of mass destruction had been found, said Iraq may have destroyed them before the U.S.-led invasion.  ___________________________________ http://mailman.lbo-talk.org/mailman/listinfo/lbo-talk

           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE MAY 27, 2003 12:25 PM  CONTACT: Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich  Doug Gordon (202) 225-5871, (202) 494-5141        Kucinich: Administration's Rhetoric Towards Iran Is Dangerous and Destabilizing;  Aggressive Approach To Iran Could Further Isolate US From International Community And Further Erode US Standing In The World      WASHINGTON - May 27 - The Administration's increased rhetoric and aggressive approach towards Iran is a dangerous and misguided policy which could further destabilize the region and further isolate the United States from the international community, Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich stated today.   Today, Kucinich, Ranking Member of the Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security, Emerging Threats and International Relations, issued the following statement:   "The increased rhetoric and the aggressive approach that this Administration is threatening towards Iran is a dangerous and misguided policy that will destabilize the region and further isolate the United States from the international community.   "The rhetoric and posturing by this Administration serves only to validate impressions in the region that the United States is empire building.   "It is disturbing that as the nation is just beginning to learn that it was misled in the build-up to war in Iraq, that this Administration is seeking to continue its dangerous policy in the region with an aggressive posture towards Iran.   "The Middle East region is at a critical juncture. Now more than ever, it is critical that the United States work with our friends and allies in the region to root out terrorists cells and implement a peaceful solution to Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Now is not the time for a continuation of this Administration's misguided policy of preemptive and unilateral war."  ###      Common Dreams NewsCenter is a non-profit news service providing breaking news and views for the Progressive Community.

      Published on Wednesday, May 28, 2003 by Reuters   Amnesty: US 'War on Terror' Has Made World Worse   by Gideon Long     LONDON - Washington's "war on terror" has made the world more dangerous by curbing human rights, undermining international law and shielding governments from scrutiny, Amnesty International said on Wednesday.     The United States continues to pick and choose which bits of its obligations under international law it will use, and when it will use them.    Irene Khan Amnesty International  Releasing its annual report into global human rights abuses in 2002, the London-based watchdog made one of its fiercest attacks yet on the policies pursued by the United States and Britain in response to the attacks of September 11, 2001.   If the war on terror was supposed to make the world safer, it has failed, and has given governments an excuse to abuse human rights in the name of state security, it said.   "What would have been unacceptable on September 10, 2001, is now becoming almost the norm," Amnesty's Secretary-General Irene Khan told a news conference, accusing Washington of adopting "a new doctrine of human rights a la carte."   "The United States continues to pick and choose which bits of its obligations under international law it will use, and when it will use them," she said, highlighting the detention without charge or trial of hundreds of prisoners in Afghanistan and in a U.S. military camp in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.   "By putting these detainees into a legal black hole, the U.S. administration appeared to continue to support a world where arbitrary unchallengeable detention becomes acceptable."   Amnesty urged the world to do more to sort out Iraq's problems now the Gulf War is over.   "There is a very real risk that Iraq will go the way of Afghanistan if no genuine effort is made to heed the call of the Iraqi people for law and order and full respect of human rights," Khan said.   "Afghanistan does not present a record of which the international community can be proud."   Amnesty's 311-page report was not concerned solely with the crises triggered by the attacks of September 11.   It said the intense media focus on Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 meant human rights abuses in Ivory Coast, Colombia, Burundi, Chechnya and Nepal had gone largely unnoticed.   Amnesty said the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo remained "bleak, with continuing fighting and attacks on civilians."   "In Burundi, government forces carried out extrajudicial killings, 'disappearances', torture and other serious violations," it said.   Amnesty said the Colombian government had "exacerbated the spiraling cycle of political violence" by introducing new security measures.   It accused Israel of committing war crimes in the occupied territories and the Palestinians of committing crimes against humanity by targeting civilians in suicide bombings.   "At least 1,000 Palestinians were killed by the Israeli army (in 2002), most of them unlawfully," it said. "Palestinian armed groups killed more than 420 Israelis, at least 265 of them civilians..."   Khan said it was vital that the world "resist the manipulation of fear and challenge the narrow focus of the security agenda."   "The definition of security must be broadened to encompass the security of people, as well as states," she said.   Copyright 2003 Reuters Ltd

      US plans death camp http://www.thecouriermail.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,5936,6494000%255E4 01,00.html 26may03  THE US has floated plans to turn Guantanamo Bay into a death camp, with its own death row and execution chamber.  Prisoners would be tried, convicted and executed without leaving its boundaries, without a jury and without right of appeal, The Mail on Sunday newspaper reported yesterday.  The plans were revealed by Major-General Geoffrey Miller, who is in charge of 680 suspects from 43 countries, including two Australians.  The suspects have been held at Camp Delta on Cuba without charge for 18 months.  General Miller said building a death row was one plan. Another was to have a permanent jail, with possibly an execution chamber.  The Mail on Sunday reported the move is seen as logical by the US, which has been attacked worldwide for breaching the Geneva Convention on prisoners of war since it established the camp at a naval base to hold alleged terrorists from Afghanistan.  But it has horrified human rights groups and lawyers representing detainees.  They see it as the clearest indication America has no intention of falling in line with internationally recognised justice.  The US has already said detainees would be tried by tribunals, without juries or appeals to a higher court. Detainees will be allowed only US lawyers.  British activist Stephen Jakobi, of Fair Trials Abroad, said: "The US is kicking and screaming against any pressure to conform with British or any other kind of international justice."  American law professor Jonathan Turley, who has led US civil rights group protests against the military tribunals planned to hear cases at Guantanamo Bay, said: "It is not surprising the authorities are building a death row because they have said they plan to try capital cases before these tribunals.  "This camp was created to execute people. The administration has no interest in long-term prison sentences for people it regards as hard-core terrorists."  Britain admitted it had been kept in the dark about the plans.  A Downing St spokesman said: "The US Government is well aware of the British Government's position on the death penalty."

      Thanks chad,  What a great forum tonight at 2nd congregational church!  The church was very warm, chad's comments and the discussion afterward was very inspiring.  We can build a movement that will counter the far rights dreams of world domination.  We can and we must.  For those who weren't there...  Chad laid out the history of Iraq in the focusing on the 2th century.  He showed how iraq has been a major jewel in the previous empire (England) and the successor empire (US) designs.  He discussed the rise to power of Sadam and the Baathist and the subsequent courting of Sadam by the US government in there war for control of the middle east resources and limitation of Soviet and religious fundamentalist influence.  Then after laying out the terrain, he proposed that the US government is embarking on a path of unilateral domination of world power and resources.  This is a major rejection of the post WWII era which is based on a certian level of international cooperation.  This path also in some ways mimics the era leading up to WWII with the rise of fascism and decline of the league of nations.  Internationally, can we reassert the role of democracy in the inter national sphere?  Can we find ways to work together to address dictatorships and support democratic social change within in these societies? Domestically, can progressives create a message of hope and justice that brings together a majority of the citizens in opposition to the Bush's plans to create police states at home and aboard.  We must.  Great,  I am ready for the next meeting... :-)   Decisions from last peace committee meeting (May 21)  1. go to one forum (second tuesday) and one committee meeting (first wed) a month: 2. Move from yahoo to riseup for email list. 3. Discussed possible topics and locations.  We will focus on different types of locations and geographies. 4. Discussed the three benefit recipients and process for distributing collections:  divided evenly between the three, unless a single recipient is specified.  We decided to collect at each forum as well as the big fundraiser in August. 5. Decided to ask voices in the wilderness for someone to talk at the august fundraiser for our three beneficiaries (Doctors without borders (iraq), military Toxics Project (depleted uranium), and Revolutionary Association of Women of Afghanistan (Afghanistan).  Two versions were discussed:  one with the Indigo girls would be at the Rose Theater at UM and include several local bands.  One without the Indigo Girls would be just our local bands and be located at the Young Ave Deli.   Upcoming Calendar: June 4:  Peace committee meeting. June 10:  Forum (Culture of War/ War as Empire Maintenance) UM Smith Hall room 314 June 13: Peace Potluck July 2:  Peace committee meeting. July 8: Forum (Nuclear Proliferation and the Iraq War)  Java Cabana July 11: Peace Potluck.

         Military waste under fire  $1 trillion missing  -- Bush plan targets Pentagon accounting    Tom Abate, Chronicle Staff Writer    Sunday, May 18, 2003   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The Department of Defense, already infamous for spending $640 for a toilet seat, once again finds itself under intense scrutiny, only this time because it couldn't account for more than a trillion dollars in financial transactions, not to mention dozens of tanks, missiles and planes.   The Pentagon's unenviable reputation for waste will top the congressional agenda this week, when the House and Senate are expected to begin floor debate on a Bush administration proposal to make sweeping changes in how the Pentagon spends money, manages contracts and treats civilian employees.   The Bush proposal, called the Defense Transformation for the 21st Century Act, arrives at a time when the nonpartisan General Accounting Office has raised the volume of its perennial complaints about the financial woes at Defense, which recently failed its seventh audit in as many years.   "Overhauling DOD's financial management operations represent a challenge that goes far beyond financial accounting to the very fiber of (its) . . . business operations and culture," GAO chief David Walker told lawmakers in March.   WHAT HAPPENED TO $1 TRILLION?   Though Defense has long been notorious for waste, recent government reports suggest the Pentagon's money management woes have reached astronomical proportions. A study by the Defense Department's inspector general found that the Pentagon couldn't properly account for more than a trillion dollars in monies spent. A GAO report found Defense inventory systems so lax that the U.S.   Army lost track of 56 airplanes, 32 tanks, and 36 Javelin missile command launch-units.   And before the Iraq war, when military leaders were scrambling to find enough chemical and biological warfare suits to protect U.S. troops, the department was caught selling these suits as surplus on the Internet "for pennies on the dollar," a GAO official said.   Given these glaring gaps in the management of a Pentagon budget that is approaching $400 billion, the coming debate is shaping up as a bid to gain the high ground in the battle against waste, fraud and abuse.   "We are overhauling our financial management system precisely because people like David Walker are rightly critical of it," said Dov Zakheim, the Pentagon's chief financial officer and prime architect of the Defense Department's self-styled fiscal transformation.   Among the provisions in the 207-page plan, the department is asking Congress to allow Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld to replace the civil service system governing 700,000 nonmilitary employees with a new system to be detailed later.   The plan would also eliminate or phase out more than a hundred reports that now tell Congress, for instance, which Defense contractors support the Arab boycott of Israel and when U.S. special forces train foreign soldiers, as well as many studies of program costs.   The administration's proposal, which would also give Rumsfeld greater authority to move money between accounts and exempt Defense from certain environmental statutes, prompted influential House Democrats to write Speaker Dennis Hastert last week complaining that the proposals would "increase the level of waste, fraud, and abuse . . . by vastly reducing (Defense) accountability."   "The Congress has increased defense spending from $300 billion to $400 billion over three years at the same time that the Pentagon has failed to address financial problems that dwarf those of Enron," said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, one of the letter's signatories.   Saying critics of the bill "were arguing for more paperwork," Hastert spokesman John Feehery said his boss would support the Bush reforms on the House floor. "The purpose is to streamline the Pentagon to become a less bureaucratic and more efficient organization . . . while also making it more accountable," Feehery said.    PROCESS WILL TAKE MONTHS  The debate will center around the defense authorization bill, the policy- setting prelude to the defense appropriations measure that comes up later in the session. With the House and Senate considering different versions of the transformation proposals, it will be months before each passes its own bill and reconciles any differences.   But few on Capitol Hill would deny that, when it comes to fiscal management,   Defense is long overdue for "transformation."   In congressional testimony Rumsfeld himself has said "the financial reporting systems of the Pentagon are in disarray . . . they're not capable of providing the kinds of financial management information that any large organization would have."   GAO reports detail not only the woeful state of Defense fiscal controls, but the cost of failed attempts to fix them.   For instance, in June 2002 the GAO reviewed the history of a proposed Corporate Information Management system, or CIM. The initiative began in 1989 as an attempt to unify more than 2,000 overlapping systems then being used for billing, inventory, personnel and similar functions. But after "spending about $20 billion, the CIM initiative was eventually abandoned," the GAO said.   Gregory Kutz, director of GAO's financial management division and co-author of that report, likened Defense to a dysfunctional corporation, with the Pentagon cast as a holding company exercising only weak fiscal control over its subsidiaries -- the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. Today, DOD has about 2,200 overlapping financial systems, Kutz said, and just running them costs taxpayers $18 billion a year.   "The (Pentagon's) inability to even complete an audit shows just how far they have to go," he said.   Kutz contrasted the department's loose inventory controls to state-of-the- art systems at private corporations.   "I've been to Wal-Mart," Kutz said. "They were able to tell me how many tubes of toothpaste were in Fairfax, Va., at that given moment. And DOD can't find its chem-bio suits."    CRITICS CALLED UNPATRIOTIC  Danielle Brian, director of the Project on Governmental Oversight, a nonprofit group in Washington, D.C., said waste has become ingrained in the Defense budget because opposition to defense spending is portrayed as unpatriotic, and legislators are often more concerned about winning Pentagon pork than controlling defense waste.   "You have a black hole at the Pentagon for money and a blind Congress," Brian said.   But things may be changing.   GAO's Kutz said Rumsfeld has "showed a commitment" to cutting waste and asked Pentagon officials to save 5 percent of the defense budget, which would mean a $20 billion savings.   Legislators are also calling attention to Defense waste. "Balancing the military's books is not as exciting as designing or purchasing the next generation of airplanes, tanks, or ships, but it is just as important," Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., said last week. In a hearing last month about cost overruns, Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn., of the House Committee on Government Reform said: "I've always considered myself to be a pro-military type person, but that doesn't mean I just want to sit back and watch the Pentagon waste billions and billions of dollars."   But while Capitol Hill sees the need, and possibly has the will to reform the Pentagon, the devil remains in the details, and the administration aroused Democratic suspicions when it dropped its 207-page transformation bill on lawmakers on April 10 -- leaving scant time to scrutinize proposals that touch many aspects of the biggest department in government.   "We have as much problem with the process as with the substance," said said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., who co-signed Waxman's letter calling the transformation bill "an effort by the Department to substantially reduce congressional oversight and public accountability."   Defense's Zakheim counters that the reform proposals would "remove the barnacles of past practices (and provide) DOD with modern day management while preserving congressional oversight and prerogatives."   But Waxman, a critic of the administration's handling of Iraqi reconstruction contracts, called the proposals "a military wish list" to take advantage of "the wartime feeling."   "Secretary Rumsfeld is hoping to march through Congress like he marched through Iraq," Waxman said.   E-mail Tom Abate at tabate@sfchronicle.com.

       Where have all the protesters gone?    urlLink http://www.newsday.com/news/local/wire/ny-bc-ny--anti-warpostscrip0526may26, 0,960306.story?coll=ny-ap-regional-wire   By JEFF DONN Associated Press Writer  May 26, 2003, 4:53 PM EDT   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The war is over in Iraq, but Reyko Shiraishi's heart is not at peace.  Outwardly, things are much the same in her life as before the war. No more anti-war vigils, forums, or protests. She has returned to her gardening and quiet routines of retirement.  But sadness again darkens the eyes of Shiraishi, 73, of Brookline, who spent 3{ years in American internment camps for Japanese Americans during World War II. Like many who objected to this latest war, she carries away a sense of failure _ protests didn't prevent the fighting _ and dejection over hardships in post-war Iraq.  "I feel so discouraged by what our country has done," said Shiraishi, a former schoolteacher. "We `won the war,' but I personally feel defeated."  Earlier this year, hundreds of thousands of Iraq war opponents like Shiraishi hoisted signs, waved banners, marched, and blocked streets and federal offices in dozens of American cities coast to coast. It was the widest outpouring of domestic protest since the Vietnam war.  Since early April, when American forces took control of Baghdad, the booming voice of protest has subsided to a murmur.  What has become of the peace movement? Did protesters come to see the war as more justified when they learned more of Saddam Hussein's oppression? Did the relatively easy victory relieve their fears of military and civilian casualties?  The short answer is that minds were not changed, according to an Associated Press sampling of war opponents' postwar views.  The AP spoke with 20 people from Maine to California who had opposed the war, from protest leaders to objectors who never went to a single demonstration. Included was a panel discussion at the regional headquarters of the American Friends Service Committee, an arm of the pacifist Quaker church, in Cambridge. The interviews did not represent a scientific survey sample.  In their comments, the interviewees struck some common themes. Many profess to feel personally changed by the war, which they view as a history-making act of aggression, a brutish projection of American military and corporate might, and an embarrassing flouting of international opinion.  Many acknowledge feeling powerlessness and weariness after standing up against a military campaign that rolled over both Iraqi defenses and the anti-war movement. However, many are already rechanneling their energy into other social causes or party politics, often with a mind to unseating President Bush in next year's election.  "Has my passion diminished? It's not focused in the same direction. I would say it's focused on the next election and regime change at home," said Donna Francescani, 35, a lawyer in Bethesda, Md.  She has begun attending campaign events for Sen. John Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat. He hasn't taken the strongest anti-war stand of all presidential candidates, but his big asset, in her mind, is simply that she thinks he can beat Bush.  Some of the calm on the anti-war front is perhaps natural. The immediate crisis seems to have passed. Many peace activists had been driving themselves hard since the September 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. They simply needed a break.  Gordon Clark was sometimes putting in 50-hour weeks, or more, as national coordinator of the Iraq Pledge of Resistance. Last week, he was vacationing in California with his wife. "One of the things that I've tried to do as much as possible during vacation is ignore current events," he said.  Many who opposed the war have paused to take stock of themselves and consider new directions for their activism. Joseph Gerson, programs director at American Friends Service Committee in Cambridge, said he feels "a profound and internalized sadness" over what has happened.  Annie Bartos, 25, a coordinator for the Boston-area United for Justice with Peace, was left with a deeper cynicism about government. "They're not listening, and it's getting harder to stay optimistic," she said.  Yet the explosive growth of the peace movement earlier this year is a consolation to the war's opponents. Anna Hendricks, a 21-year-old Cambridge dance teacher, said the war gave her the chance to connect with activists from the Vietnam and other eras.  Peace Action, a large national group, has launched a Campaign for a New Foreign Policy, refocusing on international human rights, arms control, and cooperation. It has also joined in placing get-out-the-vote ads in advance of the presidential election.  "It may be quieter out there, but the groups aren't fading away. They're looking toward the future," said Scott Lynch, a spokesman for Peace Action.  In Montpelier, Vt., Andrea Stander, 50, who works for an arts group, has contacted the presidential campaign of former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, a Democrat. She is attracted by his opposition to the war. "I certainly have a greater sense of urgency. I feel that we are facing an unprecedented crisis, at least in my lifetime," she said.  Louis Schwartz, 38, who teaches film studies at the University of Iowa, wants to develop video projects that could be used by activist groups, perhaps on what he sees as threats to civil rights. "It's reminded me of how important it is to me to be political active, something frankly that ... I had forgotten," he said.  Many war opponents have kept abreast of Iraq's occupation, too, and say the United States should turn over control to the United Nations or an international coalition. Many find vindication for their anti-war stance in what they see as a country unhinged, transformed into the Wild West of the Middle East, racked by misery and disease.  "They haven't done anything to relieve suffering. All they've done is create more," said painter Linda Hanson, 61, of Alameda, Calif. "I've never been ashamed to be an American before. I feel a lot of that now."  Frances H. Jarvis, a staffer at American Friends Service Committee, finds other justification for her anti-war stand in the occupation: "The lack of proof that weapons of mass destruction existed in Iraq confirms my belief that the war was built on lies."  However, the opposition of Wayne Carrington, a publisher's representative in Oneonta, N.Y., would soften if such weapons turned up in considerable numbers. "I almost demand that they find them: This is how the war was sold to Americans," he said.  Some war objectors have felt alarm at recent reports of mass graves of Saddam Hussein's enemies and outright satisfaction in his fall, despite their anti-war stance.  "You cannot be unhappy that Saddam Hussein is out of power, and the bodies that are being found just show what a terrible person he was," said Adam Miles, a consultant to the American Friends Service Committee.  But many say the war was too high a price and the wrong way to set things right. Alex Liazos, a sociology professor at Regis College in Weston, Mass., said, "Saddam may be out, but what's happening is even worse,"  ___P>  EDITOR'S NOTE _ Jeff Donn is the AP's Boston-based Northeast regional writer.

COHEN  [posted online on May 19, 2003]  Ever since the main military campaign ended in mid-April, the Bush Administration and its cheerleaders in the media have claimed that "the remarkable success" of the US war in Iraq proves its opponents were "spectacularly wrong"--even, some charge, unpatriotic. (Quoting a Washington "humorist," Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld gloated, "Never have so many been so wrong about so much.") Intimidated by these allegations and the demonstration of overwhelming American military power, many critics of the war have fallen silent. Indeed, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, no doubt speaking for several of the party's fainthearted presidential candidates, has rushed to urge that the "the war...not be on the ballot in 2004."   But critics of the war have no reason to regret their views. No sensible opponent doubted that the world's most powerful military could easily crush such a lesser foe. The real issue was and remains very different: Will the Iraq war increase America's national security, as the Bush Administration has always promised and now insists is already the case, or will it undermine and diminish our national security, as thoughtful critics believed?   In the weeks, months and years ahead, we will learn the answer to that fateful question by judging developments by seven essential criteria:   (1) Will the war discourage or encourage other regional "preemptive" military strikes, particularly by nuclear-armed states such as, but not only, India and Pakistan? India has already evoked that newly proclaimed US doctrine in its conflict with Pakistan, as has Russia in its increasingly hostile relations with the former Soviet republic of Georgia.   (2) Indeed, will the Iraq war stop the proliferation of states that possess nuclear weapons or instead incite more governments to acquire them as a deterrent against another US "regime change"? If anything, North Korea and Iran have seemed even more determined to develop such weapons.   (3) Will the war, and the long US occupation that is likely to ensue, reduce the recruitment of young Arabs by terrorist movements or will it inspire many new recruits? The subsequent suicide bombings in Saudi Arabia and Morocco suggest that the latter result will be the case.   (4) With or without more recruits, will the war decrease or increase the number of terrorist plots against the United States, whether at home or abroad? Here too the recent targeting of a US firm in Saudi Arabia and continuing "terrorist" attacks on American troops even in Iraq itself are not good signs.   (5) Will the war help safeguard the vast quantities of nuclear and other materials of mass destruction that exist in the world today, and the expertise needed to operationalize them, or make them more accessible to "evil-doers"? In this exceedingly perilous respect, the war may have aleady made things worse. Not only has the Bush Administration yet to find any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, its original professed purpose for attacking the country, but the war led directly to the looting of at least seven Iraqi nuclear facilities and thus possibly to a new kind of proliferation.   (6) In that connection, will Russia--which has more ill-secured devices of mass destruction than any other country and which strongly opposed and still resents the US war--now be more, or less, inclined to collaborate with Washington in safeguarding and reducing those weapons and materials? Again, the initial result has been contrary to American national security interests. On May 16, President Vladimir V. Putin announced that the Kremlin, like the White House, is likely to build even more nuclear weapons.   (7) Finally, considering the rampant anti-Americanism it has provoked, will the war result in more or fewer governments willing to cooperate with--individually or in multinational organizations like the United Nations--George W. Bush's stated top priority, the war against global terrorism? During the weeks since the military campaign ended, anti-American sentiments have continued to grow, from the Middle East to Western Europe, and the United Nations remains profoundly divided by the US war and its ugly aftermath in Iraq.   It is by these crucial (and measurable) criteria that the American people, and any politician who wants to lead them, must judge the Administration's war in Iraq and President Bush's own leadership. Those of us who were against the war and still oppose the assumptions on which it was based fear that future events will continue to answer these questions to the grave detriment of American and international security. As patriots, we can only hope we are wrong.

      What should lovers of peace and justice do with memorial day.  A day that many dwell on the "heroes of war."    Kathleen McTigue has some words that are fitting.  "hHeroes of War" are transformed into our own personal sages who walk with us still.   ******* They are with Us Still.  In the struggles we choose for ourselves, in the ways we move forward in our lives and bring our wold forward with us.    It is right  to remember the names of those who gave us strength in this choice of living.  It is right to name the power of hard lives well-lived.  We share a history with those lives.  We belong to the same motion.  They too were strengthened by what had gone before.  They too were drawn on by the vision of what might come to be.  Those who lived before us, who struggled for justice and sufferend in justistice before us, have not melted into the dust, and have not disappeared.    They are with us still.   The lives they lived hold us steady.  Their words remind us and call us back to ourselves.  Their courage and love evoke our own.  We, the living, carry them with us:  we are their voices, their hands and their hearts.  We take them with us, and with them choose the deeper path of living.  (Let us name those who lend strength in our lives.)  ****

      WASHINGTON (June 5) - Attorney General John Ashcroft asked Congress Thursday for expanded powers to hold suspected terrorists indefinitely before trials and to let him seek the death penalty or life imprisonment for any terrorist act.  Ashcroft told the House Judiciary Committee that the 2001 Patriot Act signed into law after the Sept. 11 attacks should also be expanded to let prosecutors bring charges against anyone who supports or works with suspected terrorist groups as ``material supporters.''  ``The law has several weaknesses which terrorists could exploit, undermining our defenses,'' Ashcroft said.  Ashcroft, who held up copies of al-Qaida's declarations of war against America and read aloud some of the names of those killed in the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, said new penalties in the USA Patriot Act have helped the Justice Department prevent more terrorist attacks in America.  Ashcroft also said the department did not break any laws despite an internal Justice Department report that criticized the government's treatment of illegal aliens held after the attacks.  The department's inspector general found ``significant problems'' in the Bush administration's actions toward 762 foreigners held on immigration violations after the attacks. Only one, Zacarias Moussaoui, has been charged in the United States with a terrorism-related crime; 505 have been deported.  Some of the Sept. 11 detainees were held for up to eight months, although most were deported before a 90-day deadline for releasing them.  Ashcroft said department policy, ``for which we do not apologize,'' is to detain people who are in the country illegally for as long as it takes to clear them before they are deported.  He also said the Justice Department would investigate allegations of abuse of the detainees, although 14 of 18 cases referred so far already have been cleared without any charges being filed. ``We do not stand for abuse,'' Ashcroft said.  The USA Patriot Act granted the government broad new powers to use wiretaps, electronic and computer eavesdropping and searches, and the authority to access a wide range of financial and other information in its investigations.  Under the threat of the increased USA Patriot Act penalties, several detainees are cooperating with the Justice Department to reduce their sentences, Ashcroft said.  ``Since September 11, we have obtained criminal plea agreements, many under seal, from more than 15 individuals who, according to the agreement and in order to have the agreement carried out, will continue and must continue to cooperate with the government in its investigation of terrorists,'' he said.  One person gave federal officials intelligence on terrorist weapons stored in the United States, while another has identified places being scouted or cased for potential attacks by al-Qaida, he said.  ``With the Patriot Act and our prevention strategy, we can point to steady progress in America's war on terrorism,'' he said.  Several Democrats complained about the department's use of the new anti-terrorism powers. ``We are concerned about the way you have used your powers, the way you have detained immigrants,'' said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.  Added Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.: ``Some of us find that the collateral damage is greater than it needs to be in the conduct of this war.''  House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., says he is sensitive to civil liberties complaints. ``To my mind, the purpose of the Patriot Act is to secure our liberties and not undermine them,'' he said.  Sensenbrenner complained earlier this year that the department wasn't sharing enough information with lawmakers for them to judge how the act is working. That lack of information has made it unlikely that he will support expanding the department's powers, or renewing its current authority when the act expires in October 2005, Sensenbrenner said in April.  ``My support for this legislation is neither perpetual or unconditional,'' he said Thursday.  Since then, the Justice Department has answered dozens of written questions from the House Judiciary Committee and has sent several Justice Department officials to testify before it.  06/05/03 11:59 EDT  Copyright 2003 The Associated Press.

      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE JUNE 3, 2003 12:31 PM  CONTACT: Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich  Doug Gordon (202) 225-5871 or (202) 494-5141       Kucinich To Use House Procedure To Demand Release Of Intelligence That Led To War In Iraq; To Hold Press Conference Wednesday, June 4 at 12pm on Cannon Terrace      WASHINGTON - June 3 - Congressman Dennis J. Kucinich (D-OH), leader of the opposition to the war in Iraq in the House, will hold a news conference tomorrow, June 4th, at noon on the Cannon Terrace to announce that he will use a Resolution of Inquiry to demand the release of the intelligence that led to the war in Iraq.   "This Administration led this nation into war based on lies," stated Kucinich. "I think that this Congress, and the American people, have a right to know what information this Administration had, and how they justify their public comments. Now is the time for truth telling."   At tomorrow's news conference Kucinich will announce that he will introduce a Resolution of Inquiry to demand the release of intelligence, to Congress, that the Administration used to justify their claims that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.   A Resolution of Inquiry is a rarely used House procedure that Kucinich used successfully in March to get the Administration to release the 12,000 page weapons report that Iraq had submitted to the UN.   The news conference will take place at 12pm on Wednesday, June 4th, at the Cannon Terrace. (Rain Room: HC-6, Capitol).

      Action Update Administration to Move Forward with New Nukes  The President and Congress are moving forward with reckless plans to develop new nuclear weapons. While the President paid lip service to nonproliferation efforts by joining G-8 leaders in France in saying that the spread of nuclear weapons was "the pre-eminent threat to international security," the administration's plans for new nukes will almost certainly lead to a new round in the proliferation of these deadly weapons.  Votes fell along party lines as both the House and Senate recently repealed a ban on research into low-yield nuclear weapons. Legislators also voted to explore development of a powerful "bunker buster" nuclear bomb. These provisions were part of a record $400 billion defense authorization bill that was passed in late May. Congress will settle differences in conference over the House and Senate versions of the bill later this month.

        There Must Be Weapons Of Mass Destruction In Here Somewhere     By Helen Thomas   June 3, 2003 by the St Paul Pioneer Press    urlLink http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/5998524.htm     The Central Intelligence Agency is investigating the accuracy of the Bush administration's conclusions that Iraq represented an imminent and direct threat to the United States.  The administration cited U.S. intelligence assessments that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had ties to al-Qaida terrorists as reasons to attack Iraq.  Now, after seven weeks of U.S. occupation of Iraq, the failure to find evidence supporting those accusations raises the prospect that President Bush, Secretary of State Colin Powell, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other administration officials either exaggerated the danger to justify the invasion of Iraq or were misled by flawed intelligence.  There's also another possible outcome: U.S. searchers will eventually find that evidence. While asking tough questions about administration credibility, we should keep an open mind.  We know with certitude that Saddam Hussein didn't use those monstrous weapons during the war, despite pre-war U.S. claims that front-line units of the Iraqi army had been delegated authority to do so. Either the weapons are buried deep or were destroyed  or they didn't exist.  Four retired CIA officials with access to the classified reports of 12 separate intelligence agencies are conducting the U.S. intelligence review. A CIA spokesman said it would be months before the study is completed.  Rumsfeld, who suggested last fall that the looming Iraq war would provide a perfect case study to compare pre-war intelligence assessments with post-war evidence, requested the study. At the time, Rumsfeld had been frustrated over the conflicting intelligence reports he was getting on Iraq.  Faced with a credibility gap, administration officials have been gradually rolling back some of their pre-war assertions  always made with great confidence and convincing detail  about Iraq's store of tons of biological and chemical weapons.  In a speech to the Council of Foreign Relations in New York May 27, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld suggested the weapons were destroyed before the start of the war.  Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz told the Washington Post that Iraqi concealment has been clever.  "No one should expect this kind of deception effort to get penetrated overnight," he said. Stay tuned.  According to the next issue of Vanity Fair magazine, Wolfowitz cited "bureaucratic reasons" for focusing on Saddam's alleged arsenal and said a "huge" reason for the war was to enable Washington to withdraw its troops from Saudi Arabia.  "For bureaucratic reasons we settled on one issue, weapons of mass destruction, because it was the one reason everyone could agree on," Wolfowitz was quoted as saying.  White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said the discovery last month of two tractor-trailers  fitted for high tech laboratory work  proved they could be used to produce illicit weapons for germ warfare. No such products were found in the trucks.  Nevertheless, Fleischer said, "they have been caught red handed."  Of course that attitude conveniently overlooks the fact that no one doubts that Saddam owned weapons of mass destruction in the early 1990s. The question is: Did he still possess such weapons more recently? Rumsfeld said last week, "We don't know what happened."  Some CIA analysts have quietly complained of Bush administration pressure to cook the intelligence reports to bolster its militant position on Iraq.  One point of friction is a special intelligence unit created at the Pentagon last year when Defense Department officials thought the CIA was not giving enough attention to the Iraqi exiles.  CIA officers, in turn, began to complain that the Pentagon unit was staffed by conservative ideologues who put a political spin on the information at hand.  Bush apparently based his war decisions on the intelligence advice of his close coterie of conservative aides who had been itching to invade Iraq since they came into office.  Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., a presidential candidate and the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, wonders whether there was an intelligence failure and whether the statements made by Powell before the United Nations on Feb. 5 concerning Iraq's arsenal might prove to be untrue.  It is up to Bush to clear up the confusion. Some might say, "So what? We got rid of the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein and liberated the Iraqis."  But that would ignore the duty of our elected leaders to level with the American people. And it would ignore the public's duty to demand that accountability.

        urlLink http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,970331,00.html   Wolfowitz: Iraq war was about oil    George Wright Wednesday June 4, 2003   Oil was the main reason for military action against Iraq, a leading White House hawk has claimed, confirming the worst fears of those opposed to the US-led war. The US deputy defence secretary, Paul Wolfowitz - who has already undermined Tony Blair's position over weapons of mass destruction (WMD) by describing them as a "bureaucratic" excuse for war - has now gone further by claiming the real motive was that Iraq is "swimming" in oil.  The latest comments were made by Mr Wolfowitz in an address to delegates at an Asian security summit in Singapore at the weekend, and reported today by German newspapers Der Tagesspiegel and Die Welt.  Asked why a nuclear power such as North Korea was being treated differently from Iraq, where hardly any weapons of mass destruction had been found, the deputy defence minister said: "Let's look at it simply. The most important difference between North Korea and Iraq is that economically, we just had no choice in Iraq. The country swims on a sea of oil."  Mr Wolfowitz went on to tell journalists at the conference that the US was set on a path of negotiation to help defuse tensions between North Korea and its neighbours - in contrast to the more belligerent attitude the Bush administration displayed in its dealings with Iraq.  His latest comments follow his widely reported statement from an interview in Vanity Fair last month, in which he said that "for reasons that have a lot to do with the US government bureaucracy, we settled on the one issue that everyone could agree on: weapons of mass destruction."  Prior to that, his boss, defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld, had already undermined the British government's position by saying Saddam Hussein may have destroyed his banned weapons before the war.  Mr Wolfowitz's frank assessment of the importance of oil could not come at a worse time for the US and UK governments, which are both facing fierce criticism at home and abroad over allegations that they exaggerated the threat post by Saddam Hussein in order to justify the war.  Amid growing calls from all parties for a public inquiry, the foreign affairs select committee announced last night it would investigate claims that the UK government misled the country over its evidence of Iraq's WMD.   The move is a major setback for Tony Blair, who had hoped to contain any inquiry within the intelligence and security committee, which meets in secret and reports to the prime minister.  In the US, the failure to find solid proof of chemical, biological and nuclear arms in Iraq has raised similar concerns over Mr Bush's justification for the war and prompted calls for congressional investigations.  Mr Wolfowitz is viewed as one of the most hawkish members of the Bush administration. The 57-year old expert in international relations was a strong advocate of military action against Afghanistan and Iraq.  Following the September 11 terror attacks on the World Trade Centre and Pentagon, Mr Wolfowitz pledged that the US would pursue terrorists and "end" states' harbouring or sponsoring of militants.   Prior to his appointment to the Bush cabinet in February 2001, Mr Wolfowitz was dean and professor of international relations at the Paul H Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS), of the Johns Hopkins University.

      Kucinich on the House Floor: "A War Based on Pretext" 5/21/03  During consideration of a Defense Authorization bill, Congressman Dennis Kucinich -- leader of anti-war opposition on Capitol Hill -- took to the House floor to again challenge the Bush Administration's deceptions on Iraq:  "This Administration led this nation into a war based on a pretext that Iraq was an imminent threat, which it was not. The Secretary of State presented pictures to the world he said were proof. Today, despite having total control in Iraq, none of the very serious claims that the Administration made to this Congress, to this nation, and to the world have been substantiated.  "Where are the weapons of mass destruction? Indeed, what was the basis for the war? We spend $400 billion for defense. Will we spend a minute to defend truth? The American people gave up their health care, education and veterans benefits to pay for this war. And for what? Answer the questions, Mr. President."

      Published on Tuesday, June 3, 2003 by the International Herald Tribune   Poll Shows U.S. Isolation: In War's Wake, Hostility and Mistrust   by Meg Bortin     PARIS -- The war in Iraq has widened the rift between the United States and the rest of the world, with a steep plunge in Americans' views of their traditional allies and a further surge of anti-Americanism in Muslim countries, a global opinion survey shows.     The poll forcefully supported the finding of an earlier survey that a U.S. war with Iraq would fuel anti-American sentiment.      The poll of more than 15,000 people in 20 countries and the Palestinian Authority, conducted in May by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, also showed a significant loss of faith in two major international institutions created out of the ashes of World War II - the United Nations and NATO.   "The figures show that the publics - the European public and our public - are feeling that the ties that have bound us together for the last 50 years are weakening," said Madeleine Albright, the former U.S. secretary of state and chair of the Pew Global Attitudes Project. "I see this as very serious."   The poll forcefully supported the finding of an earlier survey that a U.S. war with Iraq would fuel anti-American sentiment.   As could be expected, this feeling is strongest in the Muslim world, where negative attitudes toward the United States have soared since the war on Iraq began March 20 with a wave of American air attacks over Baghdad.   One of the most extreme shifts was seen in Turkey, where the government, heeding popular sentiment, decided not to allow United States to use its soil as a base for attacks on Iraq although Washington and Ankara are partners in NATO.   The poll found that 83 percent of Turks now have an unfavorable opinion of the United States, up from 55 percent last summer.   The swing was even sharper in Indonesia, where Islamic radicalism has been rising since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York and Washington.   While 75 percent had a favorable opinion of the United States in 2000, 83 percent now have an unfavorable view. Similar levels of animosity hold sway in the Palestinian Authority and Jordan.   In fact, feelings are so intense in the Islamic world that Osama bin Laden was chosen by five Muslim publics - in Indonesia, Jordan, Morocco, Pakistan and the Palestinian Authority - as one of the three political leaders they would most trust to "do the right thing" in world affairs.   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, said he had been surprised by the extent to which "the bottom has fallen out" in the Muslim world.   "Anti-Americanism has deepened, but it has also widened," he said. "You now find it in the far reaches of Africa - in Nigeria, among Muslims - and in Indonesia. People see America as a real threat. They think we're going to invade them."   In Europe, in contrast, the image of the United States has improved since a poll in March, just before the onset of hostilities in Iraq. Yet favorable views among America's main allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization remain sharply down from levels last year.   In France, Germany and Spain, where public anger over the U.S. war plans spilled massively into the streets this winter, fewer than 50 percent have a positive view of the United States, the poll showed.   Among the French, who took an uncharacteristically univocal stand in opposing the war, favorable opinion of the United States has recovered to 43 percent - up from what Pew describes as the "abysmal" level of 31 percent in March, but well below the 63 percent favorable rating of last summer.   The Germans, who joined the French at the head of Europe's anti-war front, also remain wary of the United States, with 45 percent having a favorable opinion, up from 25 percent in March but down from 61 percent in the summer of 2002.   Animosity is far stronger on the other side of the Atlantic, where Americans were infuriated by the failure of traditional allies - and especially the French - to back them in the war.   Only 29 percent of Americans now say they have a very favorable or somewhat favorable view of France, down from 79 percent in February 2002. And just 44 percent of Americans take a favorable view of Germany now - a dramatic plunge from 83 percent in February 2002.   "The figures confirm that the Iraq crisis has precipitated a profound crisis in trans-Atlantic relations, which I think had been building for some time," said Timothy Garton Ash, author and director of the European Studies Center at Oxford.   "The deepest cause is the end of the Cold War and the fact that we no longer have a common enemy - the Soviet Union."   Among the West European allies, favorable opinion of the United States is strongest by far in Britain, America's chief partner in the war despite considerable domestic opposition to the cooperation provided by Prime Minister Tony Blair. Positive views among the British have bounced back to 70 percent, up from 48 percent in March.   Favorable opinion among the allies is weakest in Spain, where the government ignored overwhelming popular opposition to the war and backed the United States and Britain.     Asked if they had an unfavorable view of the United States because of George W. Bush or a more general problem with America, a majority in Western Europe blamed the president. Nearly three quarters in France and Germany blame Bush, as do two-thirds in Italy and six out of 10 in Britain.      Only 38 percent of Spaniards now have a positive opinion of the United States - a big increase, however, from 14 percent in March.   The hostility in Spain is not limited to U.S. policies but extends to Americans as people - fewer than half have a positive impression. But approval of "the American people" remains solid in France, where 58 percent have a favorable view, Germany (67 percent), Italy (77 percent, up 3 points since last summer) and Britain (80 percent).   Asked if they had an unfavorable view of the United States because of George W. Bush or a more general problem with America, a majority in Western Europe blamed the president. Nearly three quarters in France and Germany blame Bush, as do two-thirds in Italy and six out of 10 in Britain.   Bush, said Garton Ash, stirred European resentment by "basically giving key allies like France and Germany the feeling that, 'We don't really care whether you're with us or not,'" and in forcing the timetable. "If Bush had given us a few more months of negotiation he could probably have got the Europeans on board," he said.   "Especially now that we know Saddam didn't have a nuclear weapon in the cellar ready to use."   One casualty of the increased strains between America and Europe is NATO. A more independent approach to security and diplomatic affairs for Western Europe was favored by more than three-quarters in France, more than six out of 10 in Spain, Turkey and Italy, and 57 percent in Germany.   Britons are divided on the idea of loosening the partnership, with 51 percent favoring continued close ties and 45 percent wanting a more independent approach.   Even in the United States, a big minority - 39 percent - favors an easing of the security and diplomatic bonds that have cemented the alliance since the end of World War II.   "For those of us who care about NATO, this is a red flag," Albright said. "The only way to get beyond this is to find more ways we can work together in NATO. I think it's a relevant organization, but it can't be relevant if you don't work at it."   Another casualty of the war is the credibility of the United Nations, where protracted bickering in the run-up to the Iraq war failed to prevent hostilities.   "Favorability ratings for the world body have tumbled in 16 of the 18 countries for which benchmark figures are available," the Pew report notes. "Majorities or pluralities in most countries believe that the war in Iraq showed the UN to be less important than it once was."   In fact, not a single country surveyed has a majority who believes that the United Nations still plays an important role in dealing with international conflicts.   A further consequence of the war is a new decline in post-9/11 sympathy for the United States. Since last summer, support for America's war on terror has dropped to 60 percent from 75 percent in France, to 60 percent from 70 percent in Germany and to 51 percent from 73 percent in Russia.   Over the same period, opposition to the war on terror has swelled to more than 70 percent in Pakistan and Turkey and to 97 percent in Jordan.   With the exception of Israel, Nigeria and the United States itself, all the countries surveyed judge U.S. policies to be too unilateralist. Fully 85 percent of the French said they felt that the United States did not take into account the interests of other countries. At least seven out of 10 shared this sentiment in South Korea, Spain, Russia and Canada, as did two thirds in Australia and Germany.   Majorities in most countries polled reject the so-called Bush doctrine of military preemption. Those with majorities backing the doctrine were traditional U.S. allies - Canada, Britain, Australia and Israel - as well as Pakistan, which is involved in a military face-off with India over Kashmir and where fully 70 percent said that "military force against countries that may seriously threaten our country, but have not attacked us," can be often or sometimes justified.   As for the conduct of the war itself, majorities in every country surveyed except Spain and Turkey felt their own government made the right decision to use or not use force, or offer bases to the United States, as the case may be.   Still, majorities in many countries that opposed the use of force say they believe Iraqis are better off since the ouster of Saddam Hussein. In France and Germany, more than three-quarters say this is the case, and 70 percent in Spain agree.   Among the populations surveyed, Muslims were divided on this, with majorities or pluralities in Nigeria, Lebanon and Kuwait saying Iraqis were better off without Saddam, while most people in Turkey, Indonesia, Pakistan, Jordan and the Palestinian Authority said the Iraqis were worse off.   Underlying some of the opinions that have emerged since the war are attitudes on national identity and social values uncovered in an earlier Pew survey of more than 38,000 people in 44 countries.   The survey, conducted in 2002, demonstrated broad acceptance of U.S. ideals like democracy, the free-market model and, surprisingly, even globalization.   Yet at the same time, people in many countries see their way of life as threatened and want protection from foreign influence.   This feeling is strongest of all in Turkey, which feared being drawn into fighting in Iraq and where, even before the war, nearly 90 percent said their way of life needed defending.

        "Hunger Cannot Wait":   Lula's speech at G8 meet  June 2, 2003 Lula to Wealthy Nations: "Hunger Cannot Wait"     Narco News Translates Brazilian President Lula da Silva's Speech from the    G-8 Summit in Evian  By Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva Translated by Narco News June 2, 2003  ***********************************************    Publisher's Note: As the first salvo leading up to his June 20th meeting, in Washington, with U.S. President George W. Bush, Brazilian President Lula da Silva gave a speech on Sunday to the leaders of the "G-8" countries - the United States, France, Great Britain, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy and Russia - that called for an international tax on weapons sales, among other bold solutions, to end hunger on earth and create the conditions necessary worldwide to solve "especially, narco-trafficking and terrorism."     Narco News translates this historic speech today to English and Spanish as a guest editorial.     ******************************************************************  My first words are in appreciation for the initiative by President Jacques Chirac. The dialogue between the richest countries in the world with the developing countries is more necessary today than ever. We must work together. The solution for our problems necessarily includes respect for our differences. I come from a country that today is mobilized by an extraordinary ethical-political energy to confront not only our internal problems but also to establish new and more constructive international partnerships.     The poverty and misery that attacks millions of men and women in Brazil, in Latin America, in Africa, and in Asia, obligates us to construct a new alliance against social exclusion. I am convinced that there will not be economic development without social sustainability and that, without both, we will live in a world that is less secure each day. It is in the space of social inequality that resentments, criminality, and, especially, narco-trafficking and terrorism, prosper.     I would like to speak with you in a simple and direct manner: I come to propose collective and responsible actions of solidarity, in favor of surpassing the inhuman conditions in which a large part of the global population live. Hunger cannot wait. It is urgently necessary to confront it with emergency and structural measures. If we all accept our responsibilities, we will create a more equal environment of opportunity for all.     The world economy is showing worrisome signs of recession. Social problems like unemployment, including in the wealthy countries, are getting worse. I am sure that one of the goals of this meeting of the G-8 is to seek paths so that the economy grows again. We need a new equation that permits the return to growth and that includes the developing countries. The incorporation of the developing countries into the global economy requires access without discrimination to the markets of the wealthy countries. We have made an enormous sacrifice to become competitive. But how do we compete freely in the middle of a war of subsidies and other mechanisms of protectionism that causes, in reality, commercial exclusion?     We're not here to lament or to simply join the chorus of recriminations. We know our responsibilities. We are doing our part, executing balanced economic policies, combating and defeating corruption, bettering institutions for the good function of our economies. We have demonstrated the political will to combat social inequality and poverty. We are doing this in Brazil with democracy and pluralism, without fundamentalism, with care and firmness. We are organizing our finances and recovering the stability to grow in a sustained manner. But we know that organizing and giving stability to our economy and work is necessary, but it is not enough. We need to forge a new paradigm of development that combines financial stability with economic growth and social justice. Today we want to grow with sustainable financing, distributing income, and strengthening democracy.     There is no theory, however sophisticated it may be, that can succeed by being indifferent to misery and exclusion. Looking at modern history, above all at those periods that survived serious economic and social crises, I see that development must begin with profound social reforms. These reforms will bring millions of men and women into production, consumption, and citizenship and will create a new and prolonged economic dynamism. That's what happened in the United States beginning in the 1930s. That's what happened after World War II in Europe.     Brazil and many developing countries, over the past decade, have made the effort demanded of us to join in the dominant economic strategies. But there have not been important advances in the combat against social exclusion. To the contrary, the fundamentalism that ruled did not comply with its promised economic stability. Unemployment, hunger, and misery increased. Our systems of production did not conquer spaces in world commerce in a manner that corresponds to our sacrifices. The lack of economic and social democracy threatens every part of democracy.     We don't want the rich countries to look upon us with pity. We need structural solutions that must begin together with changes in the global economy. We hope for coherence from our wealthier partners. I look with concern upon the resistance by the World Trade Organization to remove billionaire subsidies, principally to agriculture. Priority matters - like providing access to medicines - are put off to another day.     Such attitudes are not constructive and increase skepticism in relation to the good intentions and wisdom of the more prosperous. We have to define responsibilities, and this also implies new tasks for the developing countries. Those who have the better capacity can and must execute more generous policies of solidarity in favor of the most needy nations. And this is what Brazil is doing on the regional level. My government wants to strengthen the Mercosur alliance and promote a Latin American Union. As President Kirchner, of Argentina, said, these are strategic and political projects, aimed at bettering the conditions of life. Brazil is ready to deepen its partnerships with the countries of South America and to open more space in our markets for their exports. New financial mechanisms are helping this regional integration.     I know that here you are going to discuss NEPAD. Doing our part, regarding Africa, where I will visit in August, we are going to widen our cooperation especially in the areas of health, education, professional training, and infrastructure. The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, who belong to the Rio Group, in the recent Cuzco Summit, sent President Vicente Fox of Mexico and me here as their spokesmen in Evian. There, we discussed innovative financing mechanisms to combat poverty and invest in infrastructure.     I recommend to my colleagues present here a careful reading of these proposals. Hunger is at an intolerable level. We know that there are plain conditions to surpass this epidemic. My proposal - made in Porto Alegre and in Davos - is that a world fund be created capable of giving food to whoever is hungry and, at the same time, creating conditions to end the structural causes of hunger. And this is what we have begun to do in Brazil. There are various ways to generate resources for a fund of this nature. I give you two examples. The first is taxation of the international arms trade - which would bring advantages from economic and ethical points of view. Another possibility is to create mechanisms to stimulate that the rich countries reinvest into this fund a percentage of the interest payments made by debtor countries. Some developing countries have presented proposals to confront this problem. They are valid initiatives that deserve to be considered.     Kind Colleagues, multilateralism represents, on the level of international relations, an advance comparable to democracy in national terms. The obligation of every nation committed to the progress of civilization must be valued independently of its economic size and its political and military strength. We have to maintain dialogue, widening it on firm bases, and not just from time to time. This applies to G-8 and to the Security Council of the United Nations.     Brazil's hope is that the G-8 countries will become true allies in the combat against hunger and social exclusion and that international cooperation for development will be assumed again as an indispensable condition for security and peace. My life and political trajectory cause me to believe that just causes become victorious when there is will, dialogue, and negotiation. In order for this this unprecedented meeting in Evian to attend to the legitimate anxieties of our peoples - in the South and in the North - we must demonstrate, above all, determination to combat social inequality.     Thank you very much.

       Subject: Waldorf transcript story      urlLink http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~gabriel/weblog/2003_06_01_archive.html#105458567485139322      I'm completely flabbergasted that the Waldorf transcript story, which is all over the British and international press and if true at a minimum will force Powell's resignation, has been completely ignored by the American press, aside from the Reuters article on MSNBC's website.  It is still possible that the story is a fabrication. However, that seems less likely in light of the Guardian's follow-up today detailing Jack Straw's non-denial that he had a meeting with Powell right before the UN speech at which both men expressed doubts about the weapons evidence :  Mr Straw yesterday denied he had had a private meeting with Mr Powell on February 4, the eve of the security council meeting where Mr Powell gave a dramatic presentation of intelligence material purporting to reveal hard evidence that Iraq possessed chemical and biological weapons.  The foreign secretary said he did not arrive in New York until the day of the crucial security council meeting.  Diplomatic sources remain adamant, as the Guardian reported on Saturday, that Mr Straw did have a private conversation with Mr Powell in which both men expressed their concerns about the quality of the intelligence they had been given and how it was being used to bolster their governments' case for war against Iraq. In fact, the original article did not say that Powell and Straw met on February 4, but only that they met "shortly before a crucial UN security council session on February 5." It seems eminently possible that the two met that morning, particularly because Powell's official schedule for the day shows nothing before 10:10 a.m. A story in U.S. News & World Report which discusses the weapons propaganda, but not the Waldorf meeting, confirms that Powell did stay at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel, arriving on February 4.  Straw's denial of something he wasn't even accused of doing (meeting Powell on February 4) reminds of genius-comedian Eddie Izzard's brilliant bit on lying:  When we were kids, we lied our heads off. "I didn't do it! I was? I wasn't? I was dead at the time. I was on the Moon .... with Steve." And your Dad's going,  "I haven't even accused you of anything yet!"  "Oh, all right. Well? what is? what's the question? well, I? I? well? what?"  "Did you brush your teeth?"  "No? yes? what's correct? Anyway ? yeah. I was dead at the time!"

      http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/03/opinion/03KRUG.html urlLink     Standard Operating Procedure By PAUL KRUGMAN   The mystery of Iraq's missing weapons of mass destruction has become a lot less mysterious. Recent reports in major British newspapers and three major American news magazines, based on leaks from angry intelligence officials, back up the sources who told my colleague Nicholas Kristof that the Bush administration "grossly manipulated intelligence" about W.M.D.'s.   And anyone who talks about an "intelligence failure" is missing the point. The problem lay not with intelligence professionals, but with the Bush and Blair administrations. They wanted a war, so they demanded reports supporting their case, while dismissing contrary evidence.   In Britain, the news media have not been shy about drawing the obvious implications, and the outrage has not been limited to war opponents. The Times of London was ardently pro-war; nonetheless, it ran an analysis under the headline "Lie Another Day." The paper drew parallels between the selling of the war and other misleading claims: "The government is seen as having `spun' the threat from Saddam's weapons just as it spins everything else."  Yet few have made the same argument in this country, even though "spin" is far too mild a word for what the Bush administration does, all the time. Suggestions that the public was manipulated into supporting an Iraq war gain credibility from the fact that misrepresentation and deception are standard operating procedure for this administration, which  to an extent never before seen in U.S. history  systematically and brazenly distorts the facts.  Am I exaggerating? Even as George Bush stunned reporters by declaring that we have "found the weapons of mass destruction," the Republican National Committee declared that the latest tax cut benefits "everyone who pays taxes." That is simply a lie. You've heard about those eight million children denied any tax break by a last-minute switcheroo. In total, 50 million American households  including a majority of those with members over 65  get nothing; another 20 million receive less than $100 each. And a great majority of those left behind do pay taxes.  And the bald-faced misrepresentation of an elitist tax cut offering little or nothing to most Americans is only the latest in a long string of blatant misstatements. Misleading the public has been a consistent strategy for the Bush team on issues ranging from tax policy and Social Security reform to energy and the environment. So why should we give the administration the benefit of the doubt on foreign policy?   It's long past time for this administration to be held accountable. Over the last two years we've become accustomed to the pattern. Each time the administration comes up with another whopper, partisan supporters  a group that includes a large segment of the news media  obediently insist that black is white and up is down. Meanwhile the "liberal" media report only that some people say that black is black and up is up. And some Democratic politicians offer the administration invaluable cover by making excuses and playing down the extent of the lies.  If this same lack of accountability extends to matters of war and peace, we're in very deep trouble. The British seem to understand this: Max Hastings, the veteran war correspondent  who supported Britain's participation in the war  writes that "the prime minister committed British troops and sacrificed British lives on the basis of a deceit, and it stinks."  It's no answer to say that Saddam was a murderous tyrant. I could point out that many of the neoconservatives who fomented this war were nonchalant, or worse, about mass murders by Central American death squads in the 1980's. But the important point is that this isn't about Saddam: it's about us. The public was told that Saddam posed an imminent threat. If that claim was fraudulent, the selling of the war is arguably the worst scandal in American political history  worse than Watergate, worse than Iran-contra. Indeed, the idea that we were deceived into war makes many commentators so uncomfortable that they refuse to admit the possibility.  But here's the thought that should make those commentators really uncomfortable. Suppose that this administration did con us into war. And suppose that it is not held accountable for its deceptions, so Mr. Bush can fight what Mr. Hastings calls a "khaki election" next year. In that case, our political system has become utterly, and perhaps irrevocably, corrupted.

      This is Your Story - The Progressive Story of America. Pass It On.    http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0610-11.htm   by Bill Moyers        Text of speech to the 'Take Back America' Conference    June 4, 2003    Washington, DC           Thank you for this award and for this occasion. I don't deserve either, but as George Burns said, I have arthritis and I don't deserve that, either.   Tomorrow is my 69th birthday and I cannot imagine a better present than this award or a better party than your company.      Also See:  Bill Moyers' "Presidential" Address  John Nichols/The Nation 6/9/2003       Fifty three years ago tomorrow, on my 16th birthday, I went to work for the daily newspaper in the small East Texas town where I grew up. It was a good place to be a cub reporter  ?  small enough to navigate but big enough to keep me busy and learning something every day. I soon had a stroke of luck.  Some of the old timers were on vacation or out sick and I got assigned to cover what came to be known as the Housewives' Rebellion. Fifteen women in my home town decided not to pay the social security withholding tax for their domestic workers. They argued that social security was unconstitutional, that imposing it was taxation without representation, and that  ?  here's my favorite part  ?  "requiring us to collect (the tax) is no different from requiring us to collect the garbage."  They hired themselves a lawyer  ?  none other than Martin Dies, the former congressman best known, or worst known, for his work as head of the House Committee on Un-American Activities in the 30s and 40s. He was no more effective at defending rebellious women than he had been protecting against communist subversives, and eventually the women wound up holding their noses and paying the tax.   http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0610-11.htm

      John Nichols, the nation magazine   urlLink http://www.thenation.com/thebeat/    Bill Moyers' Presidential Address  06/09/2003 @ 10:27am   E-mail this Post  Democratic presidential candidates were handed a dream audience of 1,000 "ready-for-action" labor, civil rights, peace and economic justice campaigners at the Take Back America conference organized in Washington last week by the Campaign for America's Future. And the 2004 contenders grabbed for it, delivering some of the better speeches of a campaign that remains rhetorically -- and directionally -- challenged. But it was a non-candidate who won the hearts and minds of the crowd with a "Cross of Gold" speech for the 21st century.   Recalling the populism and old-school progressivism of the era in which William Jennings Bryan stirred the Democratic National Convention of 1896 to enter into the great struggle between privilege and democracy -- and to spontaneously nominate the young Nebraskan for president -- journalist and former presidential aide Bill Moyers delivered a call to arms against "government of, by and for the ruling corporate class."   Condemning "the unholy alliance between government and wealth" and the compassionate conservative spin that tries to make "the rape of America sound like a consensual date," Moyers charged that "rightwing wrecking crews" assembled by the Bush Administration and its Congressional allies were out to bankrupt government. Then, he said, they would privatize public services in order to enrich the corporate interests that fund campaigns and provide golden parachutes to pliable politicians. If unchecked, Moyers warned, the result of these machinations will be the dismantling of "every last brick of the social contract."   "I think this is a deliberate, intentional destruction of the United States of America," said Moyers, as he called for the progressives gathered in Washington -- and for their allies across the United States -- to organize not merely in defense of social and economic justice but in order to preserve democracy itself. Paraphrasing the words of Abraham Lincoln as the 16th president rallied the nation to battle against slavery, Moyers declared, "Our nation can no more survive as half democracy and half oligarchy than it could survive half slave and half free."   There was little doubt that the crowd of activists from across the country would have nominated Moyers by acclamation when he finished a remarkable address in which he challenged not just the policies of the Bush Administration but the failures of Democratic leaders in Congress to effectively challenge the president and his minions. In the face of what he described as "a radical assault" on American values by those who seek to redistribute wealth upward from the many to a wealthy few, Moyers said he could not understand "why the Democrats are afraid to be labeled class warriors in a war the other side started and is winning."   Several of the Democratic presidential contenders who addressed the crowd after Moyers picked up pieces of his argument. Former US Senator Carol Moseley Braun actually quoted William Jennings Bryan, while North Carolina Senator John Edwards and Massachusetts Senator John Kerry tried -- with about as much success as Al Gore in 2000 -- to sound populist. Former House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt promised not to be "Bush-lite," and former Vermont Governor Howard Dean drew warm applause when he said the way for Democrats to get elected "is not to be like Republicans, but to stand up against them and fight." Ultimately, however, only the Rev. Al Sharpton and Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair Dennis Kucinich came close to matching the fury and the passion of the crowd.   Kucinich, who earned nine standing ovations for his antiwar and anti-corporate free trade rhetoric, probably did more to advance his candidacy than any of the other contenders. But he never got to the place Moyers reached with a speech that legal scholar Jamie Raskin described as one of the most "amazing and spellbinding" addresses he had ever heard. Author and activist Frances Moore Lappe said she was close to tears as she thanked Moyers for providing precisely the mixture of perspective and hope that progressives need as they prepare to challenge the right in 2004.   That, Moyers explained, was the point of his address, which reflected on White House political czar Karl Rove's oft-stated admiration for Mark Hanna, the Ohio political boss who managed the campaigns and the presidency of conservative Republican William McKinley. It was McKinley who beat Bryan in 1896 and -- with Hanna's help -- fashioned a White House that served the interests of the corporate trusts.   Comparing the excesses of Hanna and Rove, and McKinley and Bush, Moyers said "the social dislocations and the meanness of the 19th century " were being renewed by a new generation of politicians who, like their predecessors, seek to strangle the spirit of the American revolution "in the hard grip of the ruling class."   To break that grip, Moyers said, progressives of today must learn from the revolutionaries and reformers of old. Recalling the progressive movement that rose up in the first years of the 20th century to "restore the balance between wealth and commonwealth," and the successes of the New Dealers who turned progressive ideals into national policy, Moyers told the crowd to "get back in the fight." "Hear me!" he cried. "Allow yourself the conceit to believe that the flame of democracy will never go out as long as there is one candle in your hand."   While others were campaigning last week, Moyers was tending the flame of democracy. In doing so, he unwittingly made himself the candle holder-in-chief for those who seek to spark a new progressive era.

      Published on Thursday, July 10, 2003 by the Guardian/UK     White House 'Lied About Saddam Threat'     by Julian Borger in Washington     A former US intelligence official who served under the Bush administration in the build-up to the Iraq war accused the White House yesterday of lying about the threat posed by Saddam Hussein.     This administration has had a faith-based intelligence attitude ... 'We know the answers - give us the intelligence to support those answers'.    Gregory Thielmann, served as a director in the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence  The claims came as the Bush administration was fighting to shore up its credibility among a series of anonymous government leaks over its distortion of US intelligence to manufacture a case against Saddam.   This was the first time an administration official has put his name to specific claims. The whistleblower, Gregory Thielmann, served as a director in the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence until his retirement in September, and had access to the classified reports which formed the basis for the US case against Saddam, spelled out by President Bush and his aides.   Mr Thielmann said yesterday: "I believe the Bush administration did not provide an accurate picture to the American people of the military threat posed by Iraq."   He conceded that part of the problem lay with US intelligence, but added: "Most of it lies with the way senior officials misused the information they were provided."    urlLink  for more...http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0710-01.htm

      Published on Thursday, July 10, 2003 by the Washington Post     Among Democrats, The Energy Seems To Be on the Left     by David Von Drehle     Ten years after Bill Clinton proclaimed a centrist "New Democrat" revolution, the left is once again a driving force in the party.  They do not call themselves "liberals" anymore; the preferred term today is "progressives." But in other ways, they are much the same slice of the electorate that dominated the Democratic Party from 1972 to the late 1980s: antiwar, pro-environment, suspicious of corporations and supportive of federal social services.  In recent weeks, the progressive left has: lifted a one-time dark-horse presidential candidate, former Vermont governor Howard Dean, into near-front-runner status; dominated the first serious Internet "primary"; and convened the largest gathering of liberal activists in decades.  The liberal MoveOn.org is the fastest-growing political action committee in the Democratic Party. Left-leaning labor leaders, such as Andrew L. Stern, president of the Service Employees International Union, are taking a more assertive part in mapping the all-important union role in party operations.  In a sense, it was all foreshadowed by the shake-up of the House leadership after the Democrats' dismal showing at the polls last November. Liberal Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) easily defeated several more conservative Democrats to become the new minority leader.  "There is a coming together of forces to try to resurrect the Democratic Party in the progressive realm," said political strategist Eric Hauser, who helped to organize the recent Take Back America conference of left-leaning activists. "What the Democratic Party stands for hasn't really been looked at for a while. The issues that people care about seem pretty clearly to be solid progressive issues."  In a party that seemed almost comatose after November's poor showing at the polls, any energy at all might be welcome by Democrats, no matter where it comes from. And the progressives themselves certainly do not feel as though they are weighing in from the margin. "We are the base," said veteran organizer Robert Borosage, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future.    urlLink  for more....http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0710-02.htm

      something to celebrate!    Dear MoveOn member,  This isn't an email asking you to sign a petition or give money.  It's simply a celebration of a victory.  75 television executives from network affiliates descended on Capitol  Hill yesterday to prevent the House appropriations committee from  voting for a partial rollback of the FCC rule changes.  Because of you and thousands of others, Congress did something  unprecedented yesterday. Republican committee member Frank Wolf urged  his colleagues to vote their conscience, and stand up to the  lobbyists. And they did just that, delivering a 40-25 vote against big media.  Conservative columnist William Safire wrote in today?s New York Times: "Here is what made this happen: Take the force of right-wingers  upholding community standards who are determined to defend local  control of the public airwaves; combine that with the force of lefties eager to maintain diversity of opinion in local media; add in the  independent voters' mistrust of media manipulation; then let all these people have access to their representatives by e-mail and fax, and  voil! Congress awakens to slap down the power grab." (URL below)  The rollback still has a long way to go, but this is another big step  in our march to reverse the FCC and create a more diverse, independent and skeptical media.  Your active participation is working. Congress is listening. There  will be more work in the weeks and months ahead. Stay tuned and stay  involved. For more information on media reform efforts, go to  http://www.mediareform.net or http://www.commoncause.org.  Sincerely, --Eli Pariser   MoveOn.org   July 17th, 2003  P.S. Check out William Safire's editorial and another article from today's New York Times on this win:  HOUSE PANEL ADDS VOICE TO OPPONENTS OF MEDIA RULE By Jacques Steinberg, New York Times July 17th, 2003 http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/17/business/media/17FCC.html "The recent decision by federal regulators to loosen media ownership  rules, already under fire in the Senate, took another blow in Congress yesterday. This setback was dealt by the House Appropriations  Committee, which approved a budget amendment that would make it harder for big broadcasting companies to acquire more television stations.  The vote represented a defeat for Michael K. Powell, the Federal  Communications Commission chairman, who has led the effort to change  the rules. It was also a rebuke to the Republican House leadership and the Bush administration, strong supporters of the commission's  efforts."

      WIND POWER SET TO BECOME WORLD'S LEADING ENERGY SOURCE http://www.earth-policy.org/Updates/Update24.htm  LESTER R. BROWN, EARTH POLICY - In 1991, a national wind resource  inventory taken by the U.S. Department of Energy startled the world when  it reported that the three most wind-rich states--North Dakota, Kansas,  and Texas--had enough harnessable wind energy to satisfy national  electricity needs. Now a new study by a team of engineers at Stanford  reports that the wind energy potential is actually substantially greater  than that estimated in 1991. Advances in wind turbine design since 1991  allow turbines to operate at lower wind speeds, to harness more of the  wind's energy, and to harvest it at greater heights. Add to this the  recent bullish assessments of offshore wind potential, and the enormity  of the wind resource becomes apparent. In a joint assessment of global  wind resources called Wind Force 12, the European Wind Energy  Association and Greenpeace concluded that the world's wind-generating  potential -- assuming that only 10 percent of the earth's land area  would be available for development -- is double the projected world  electricity demand in 2020.

      STUDY WARNS AGAINST ELECTRONIC VOTING  http://www.washtimes.com/metro/20030724-102543-4946r.htm  WASHINGTON TIMES -  An electronic voting system used in some states and  marketed across the nation is so flawed that it could be manipulated  easily, computer security researchers concluded in a study released  yesterday. The study found "significant security flaws" with the system  designed by Diebold Election Systems. The system was vulnerable to  unscrupulous voters, as well as "insiders such as poll workers, software  developers and even janitors," who could cast multiple votes without a  trace, the study reported.   The system allows ballots to be cast on a 15-inch touch-screen monitor.  "I don't think it can be done right now this way," said which was the  first review of the software by independent computer security  researchers. Mike Jacobsen, a spokesman for the North Canton, Ohio-based  company, declined to comment in detail about the study until company  officials had more time to review it. But he said the company's systems  "pass rigorous certification tests at the federal and state governmental  levels." "However, we welcome the opportunity to work with credible  organizations, including Johns Hopkins, to continue to improve and  strengthen the security of our systems," Mr. Jacobsen said. Mr. Jacobsen  also said the software analyzed in the study was about a year old, and  problems with it may have been fixed.   [Avi Rubin of Johns Hopkins University, a lead researcher on the study]  said a secure electronic system would require a different methodology  and there was no quick fix for the current software. "You would have to  start over," he said. Rebecca Mercuri, an independent consultant who  specializes in studying electronic vote tabulation, said the report  raises questions about the security of electronic voting systems. But  widespread manipulation of the system described in the study was "highly  unlikely," she said. "There would have to be a massive violation,  systematically, of a huge amount of protocols, for this to take place,"  Miss Mercuri said.   Mr. Rubin said a glaring weakness in the system is a lack of a  verifiable audit trail that could be used to double-check voting  results. "I think they need to have paper trails, and I don't think  these kinds of machines should be used for voting," he said. The study  also concluded the system was vulnerable to a group or foreign  government wanting to influence an election.   The findings were based on a July study of the computer code used in the  voting system. The code was posted anonymously on the Internet. The  results are significant, Mr. Rubin said, as cities and states consider  computer-screen voting as an alternative to punch-card ballots that  governments decided to replace after problems during the 2000  presidential election.   Last year, about 33,000 Diebold voting stations were used in elections  in Maryland, Georgia, California and Kansas and other locations. Diebold  reached an agreement this month with Maryland to provide up to $55.6  million in voting technology, expanding the use of touch screens from  four counties to the rest of the state.   Mr. Rubin said he planned to urge state officials not to use the system.  "You guys just bought something that doesn't work," Mr. Rubin said he  planned to tell Maryland election officials. "Go get a refund."   For the study, three researchers from the Johns Hopkins Information  Security Institute and a computer scientist at Rice University analyzed  tens of thousands of lines of programming code. . . The researchers said  a voter easily could bring a specially programmed counterfeit card to  the polls and use it to cast multiple votes. Bogus cards could be made  by a 15-year-old computer enthusiast and sold for various amounts of  money depending on the number of votes it would enable a person to cast,  researchers said. The system also was susceptible to poll workers who  wanted to alter ballots, the study concluded.

      Depleted Uranium Press conference  mp3 file  The AUDIO (mp3) is available from yesterday's National call-in press conference on 'depleted' uranium with Doug Rokke, Ph.D.  Traprock Peace Center hosted the press conference with particpants from Washington, DC; New York State; North Carolina; South Dakota, Oregon and Massachusetts. The entire press conference is available for free for download (an mp3 file). Go to http://traprockpeace.org/RokkePressConf23July03.html for information and a link to the mp3 download.  More information:  Traprock Peace Center hosted this national call-in press conference with Doug Rokke, Ph.D. on 'depleted' uranium, which has been used by US, UK and Australian troops in the Iraq War.  Dr. Rokke made a number of startling revelations. Over 221,000 veterans from Gulf I are on permanent disability. Now, soldiers are coming back sick. DU is suspected as a cause. He goes into details about how the soldiers who went to the Gulf were ill-trained and ill-equipped to deal with radioactive munitions. These munitions cause a radioactive and highly toxic dust when used.   US, UK and Australian troops have spread this radioactive material widely in Iraq, to the long term detriment of Iraqi civilians and coalition soldiers as well. This spreading of radioactive contamination in Iraq is something that the US could not have done in the US without violating environmental and health laws.   Participating in the press conference were:  Doug Rokke, Ph.D., former Director of the U.S. Army Depleted Uranium (DU) Project in the aftermath of the Gulf War; Vietnam and Gulf War veteran.  Sunny Miller - Moderator, Traprock Peace Center, http://traprockpeace.org Andrew Stelzer, WBOO, Portland, OR Elizabeth Christanson, WRBO, Syracuse, NY Jon Hunt, The Fuse, Boone, NC Jean Koster, South Dakota Sun Mike Zmolek, National Network to End the War Against Iraq, http://www.endthewar.org  Dr. Rokke spoke on the road, as he is in the start of a 3 state Summer Tour on 'Depleted' Uranium through August 10. The tour is organized by Traprock Peace Center and local hosts. More information on the tour is available at http://traprockpeace.org/rokkesummerdutour03.html  The tour continues in September with mainly mid-west and west-coast dates. Groups wishing to host Doug Rokke or media wishing to interview him should call Sunny Miller at 413-773-7427.  In mid-October, Dr. Rokke will present at the World Uranium Weapons Conference in Hamburg.

      From the Nation  The White House--at least in public--doesn't seem willing to do much to determine whether Bush Administration officials blew the cover of an undercover CIA operative in order to mount a political hit job.  For the story, read David Corn's new Capital Games: http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid=845  As Corn reported in his weblog last week, a July 14 column by conservative journalist Robert Novak indicated that two unnamed "senior administration officials" had undermined national security and perhaps broken the law by revealing to Novak that the wife of former Ambassador Joseph Wilson IV was a deep-cover CIA officer.  Wilson is the envoy the CIA sent to Niger in February 2002 to check out the allegation that Saddam Hussein had tried to buy uranium there. He reported back that the charge was probably false. Earlier this month, he went public and challenged the Bush Administration's account of the Niger episode. As Corn shows, the Novak article--which revealed the name of Wilson's wife and reported she worked in the important area of weapons counterproliferation--had the stench of White House revenge and intimidation.  Read Corn's new report to see how far this White House appears willing to go to squelch criticism.  White House Ducks Smear Inquiry: http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid=845  Corn's recent report detailing the smear itself was among the most widely-circulated pieces of political material on the internet last week. If you missed the article, check it out now at: http://www.thenation.com/capitalgames/index.mhtml?bid=3&pid=823  Wilson, not one to be easily intimidated, has been speaking out against the Administration's attempts to silence him. Tonight he appears on Comedy Central's Daily Show with Jon Stewart.  The Daily Show with Jon Stewart Featuring Ambassador Joe Wilson July 24, 11:00pm, Comedy Central

      Bush Gave up war on Al QUida for the War on Iraq.  The CIA is shocked at incompetent actions by the Bush administration.  http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030728fa_fact  THE SYRIAN BET   by SEYMOUR M. HERSH   Did the Bush Administration burn a useful source on Al Qaeda?   Issue of 2003-07-28 Posted 2003-07-18      On the night of June 18th, Task Force 20, an American Special Operations team stationed in Iraq, expanded its operations dozens of miles inside Syria. Military intelligence had observed large numbers of cars and trucks speeding toward the border, and senior officers suspected that the vehicles were carrying fleeing members of the Iraqi leadership. Communications intercepts had indicated that there were more Syrian soldiers congregated along the border than usual, including some officers. The military concluded, according to a senior Administration official, that something down there was going on. Two days earlier, one of Saddam Husseins closest aides, Abid Hamid Mahmud, had been captured, and told his interrogators that he and Saddams two sons had sought refuge in Syria but were turned back. Although the Syrian government denied knowledge of the brothers whereabouts, the military was now ready to cross the border to stop any future flight attempts.

      Imperialism Now! continued   The danger of the Cabal theory is that we focus too much on bush and his neocons and we lose site of the whole sea of elites who support the overall mission of US domination of the Globe.  We may defeat Bush in 2004, but we whoever we elect will most likely have people around him that have similar views.  Maybe not the steel booted imperialism of Paul Wolfowitz, but the velvet glove imperialism of Clinton.  With this knowledge we must be clear about what an anti imperilsim is for as much as what we are against.  What we are against is not just a few elites (cabal of neocons), but a system of global control by a few corporations and their major benefactor state the US and a few other capitalist states in supporting roles: Japan, Europe, China, Russia and a few other east asian countries.

      Imperialism Now Focus  In the monthly review article   The New Age of Imperialism  by John Bellamy Foster  http://www.monthlyreview.org/0703jbf.htm  John foster argues that...   Imperialism is meant to serve the needs of a ruling class much more than a nation. It has nothing to do with democracy. Perhaps for that reason it has often been characterized as a parasitic phenomenoneven by critics as astute as John Hobson in his 1902 classic, Imperialism: A Study. And from there it is unfortunately all too easy to slide into the crude notion that imperialist expansion is simply a product of powerful groups of individuals who have hijacked a nations foreign policy to serve their own narrow ends.    Numerous critics of the current expansion of the American empireboth on the U.S. left and in Europenow argue that the United States under the administration of George W. Bush has been taken over by a neoconservative cabal, led by such figures as Paul Wolfowitz (deputy secretary of defense), Lewis Libby (the vice presidents chief of staff), and Richard Perle (of the Defense Policy Board). This cabal is said to have the strong backing of Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld and Vice President Cheney, and, through them, President Bush. The rise to prominence of the neoconservative hegemonists within the administration is thought to have been brought on by the undemocratic 2000 election, in which the Supreme Court appointed Bush as president, and by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, which suddenly enlarged the national security state. All of this has contributed, we are told, to a unilateralist and belligerent foreign policy at odds with the historic U.S. role in the world. As the Economist magazine raised this question in its April 26, 2003 issue: So has a cabal taken over the foreign policy of the most powerful country in the world? Is a tiny group of ideologues using undue power to intervene in the internal affairs of other countries, create an empire, trash international lawand damn the consequences?     The Economists own answer was Not really. Rightly rejecting the cabal theory, it argued instead that the neo-cons are part of a broader movement and that a near-consensus [among U.S. policy elites] is found around the notion that America should use its power vigorously to reshape the world.   ******* this is an important contribution.  To argue that what is wrong with the cabal theory is that it isolates the problem of US policy control in a small group of people and ignores the widely held position of elites extending through both conservative and liberal camps.  This is why even the most fair reporting on NPR or PBS news does not reflect a wide range of views, but only tends to reconfirm the concensus view that US needs to act to maintain world order.  Classic imperialist rhetoric is supported from the all camps liberal and conservative, democrat and republican.

      Amazing but true stories   Former Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., told United Press  International that the White House did not want the  "9/11" report made public before launching military  action in Iraq. He said the administration feared  publication might undermine the administration's case  for war, which was based in part on the allegation  that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had supported Osama  bin Laden -- and the attendant possibility that Iraq  might supply al-Qaida with weapons of mass  destruction.   http://www.upi.com/print.cfm?StoryID=20030723-064812-9491r   Throughout 2002 and early 2003, Rice repeatedly  insisted that the Administration sought a peaceful  solution to the Iraq conflict and that war was only a  last resort. In October of 2002, she said, ??We're  going to seek a peaceful solution to this. We think  that one is possible?? [CBS, 10/20/02]. Then in  November of 2002, she said, ??We all want very much to  see this resolved in a peaceful way?? [Briefing,  11/21/02]. In March of 2003, she claimed ??we are still  in a diplomatic phase here?? [ABC, 3/9/03]. However,  according to Richard Haas, Bush??s director of policy  planning at the State Department, the decision had  already been made by July of 2002. When asked exactly  when he learned war in Iraq was definite, Haas said,  ??The moment was the first week of July (2002), when I  had a meeting with Condi. I raised this issue about  were we really sure that we wanted to put Iraq front  and center at this point, given the war on terrorism  and other issues. And she said, essentially, that that  decision's been made, don't waste your breath. And  that was early July. So then when Powell had his  famous dinner with the President, in early August,  2002 [in which Powell persuaded Bush to take the  question to the U.N.] the agenda was not whether Iraq,  but how??

       urlLink Economist.com | Occupying Iraq   FLAMES belch out of the desert in northern Iraq where, on July 31st, an unidentified saboteur placed an explosive device under a buried fuel pipeline leading to a local distribution station. Five days later, an American civilian contractor working at the local refinery was killed when his truck drove over an anti-tank mine. The blasts, coming shortly before crude oil is to begin flowing from the Bayji terminus to Turkey, suggest that the 150,000 American troops in the country cannot fully protect either themselves or Iraq's infrastructure from low-level insurgencyand that oil exports are unlikely to cover the costs of getting Iraq back on its feet.  The day before the pipeline attack, Paul Bremer, head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) running Iraq, announced that he hoped to be going home within a year. It was not unreasonable, he said, that elections for a sovereign Iraqi government could be held by mid-2004. The occupation is a drain on American blood and treasure, and the occupiers may be looking for an exit strategy, perhaps before George Bush must stand for re-election.

The official view from the Pentagon is that all is going well in Iraq and that the US forces are more than ready to continue the global war against terrorism. And yet, as the army commanders and planners in the Pentagon know only too well, this is a mere diplomatic smokescreen. The reality is that US forces are now severely overstretched and the number of their military commitments worldwide is increasing by the day.   The USA remains the biggest military power in the world, but it is beginning to experience the classic symptoms of imperial fatigue.

      POWER OUTAGE TRACED TO DIM BULB IN WHITE HOUSE --- THE TALE OF THE BRITS WHO SWIPED 800 JOBS FROM NEW YORK, CARTED OFF $90 MILLION, THEN TONIGHT, TURNED OFF OUR LIGHTS  by Greg Palast Palast is author of the New York Times bestseller, "The Best Democracy Money Can Buy" (Penguin USA) and the worstseller, "Democracy and Regulation," a guide to electricity deregulation published by the United Nations (with T. MacGregor and J. Oppenheim).    I can tell you all about the ne're-do-wells that put out our lights tonight. I came up against these characters -- the Niagara Mohawk Power Company -- some years back. You see, before I was a journalist, I worked for a living, as an investigator of corporate racketeers. In the 1980s, "NiMo" built a nuclear plant, Nine Mile Point, a brutally costly piece of hot junk for which NiMo and its partner companies charged billions to New York State's electricity ratepayers.   To pull off this grand theft by kilowatt, the NiMo-led consortium fabricated cost and schedule reports, then performed a Harry Potter job on the account books. In 1988, I showed a jury a memo from an executive from one partner, Long Island Lighting, giving a lesson to a NiMo honcho on how to lie to government regulators. The jury ordered LILCO to pay $4.3 billion and, ultimately, put them out of business.  And that's why, if you're in the Northeast, you're reading this by candlelight tonight. Here's what happened. After LILCO was hammered by the law, after government regulators slammed Niagara Mohawk and dozens of other book-cooking, document-doctoring utility companies all over America with fines and penalties totaling in the tens of billions of dollars, the industry leaders got together to swear never to break the regulations again. Their plan was not to follow the rules, but to ELIMINATE the rules. They called it "deregulation."  It was like a committee of bank robbers figuring out how to make safecracking legal.  But they dare not launch the scheme in the USA. Rather, in 1990, one devious little bunch of operators out of Texas, Houston Natural Gas, operating under the alias "Enron," talked an over-the-edge free-market fanatic, Britain's Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, into licensing the first completely deregulated power plant in the hemisphere.   And so began an economic disease called "regulatory reform" that spread faster than SARS. Notably, Enron rewarded Thatcher's Energy Minister, one Lord Wakeham, with a bushel of dollar bills for 'consulting' services and a seat on Enron's board of directors. The English experiment proved the viability of Enron's new industrial formula: that the enthusiasm of politicians for deregulation was in direct proportion to the payola provided by power companies.   The power elite first moved on England because they knew Americans wouldn't swallow the deregulation snake oil easily. The USA had gotten used to cheap power available at the flick of switch. This was the legacy of Franklin Roosevelt who, in 1933, caged the man he thought to be the last of the power pirates, Samuel Insull. Wall Street wheeler-dealer Insull creator of the Power Trust, and six decades before Ken Lay, faked account books and ripped off consumers. To frustrate Insull and his ilk, FDR gave us the Federal Power Commission and the Public Utilities Holding Company Act which told electricity companies where to stand and salute. Detailed regulations limited charges to real expenditures plus a government-set profit. The laws banned "power markets" and required companies to keep the lights on under threat of arrest -- no blackout blackmail to hike rates.   Of particular significance as I write here in the dark, regulators told utilities exactly how much they had to spend to insure the system stayed in repair and the lights stayed on. Bureaucrats crawled along the wire and, like me, crawled through the account books, to make sure the power execs spent customers' money on parts and labor. If they didn't, we'd whack'm over the head with our thick rule books. Did we get in the way of these businessmen's entrepreneurial spirit? Damn right we did.   Most important, FDR banned political contributions from utility companies -- no 'soft' money, no 'hard' money, no money PERIOD.  But then came George the First. In 1992, just prior to his departure from the White House, President Bush Senior gave the power industry one long deep-through-the-teeth kiss good-bye: federal deregulation of electricity. It was a legacy he wanted to leave for his son, the gratitude of power companies which ponied up $16 million for the Republican campaign of 2000, seven times the sum they gave Democrats.  But Poppy Bush's gift of deregulating of wholesale prices set by the feds only got the power pirates halfway to the plunder of Joe Ratepayer. For the big payday they needed deregulation at the state level. There were only two states, California and Texas, big enough and Republican enough to put the electricity market con into operation.  California fell first. The power companies spent $39 million to defeat a 1998 referendum pushed by Ralph Nadar which would have blocked the de-reg scam. Another $37 million was spent on lobbying and lubricating the campaign coffers of legislators to write a lie into law: in the deregulation act's preamble, the Legislature promised that deregulation would reduce electricity bills by 20%. In fact, when San Diegans in the first California city to go "lawless" looked at their bills, the 20% savings became a 300% jump in surcharges.  Enron circled California and licked its lips. As the number one life-time contributor to the George W. Bush campaign, it was confident about the future. With just a half dozen other companies it controlled at times 100% of the available power capacity needed to keep the Golden State lit. Their motto, "your money or your lights." Enron and its comrades played the system like a broken ATM machine, yanking out the bills. For example, in the shamelessly fixed "auctions" for electricity held by the state, Enron bid, in one instance, to supply 500 megawatts of electricity over a 15 megawatt line. That's like pouring a gallon of gasoline into a thimble -- the lines would burn up if they attempted it. Faced with blackout because of Enron's destructive bid, the state was willing to pay anything to keep the lights on.   And the state did. According to Dr. Anjali Sheffrin, economist with the California state Independent System Operator which directed power movements, between May and November 2000, three power giants physically or "economically" withheld power from the state and concocted enough false bids to cost the California customers over $6.2 billion in excess charges.  It took until December 20, 2000, with the lights going out on the Golden Gate, for President Bill Clinton, once a deregulation booster, to find his lost Democratic soul and impose price caps in California and ban Enron from the market.   But the light-bulb buccaneers didn't have to wait long to put their hooks back into the treasure chest. Within seventy-two hours of moving into the White House, while he was still sweeping out the inaugural champagne bottles, George Bush the Second reversed Clinton's executive order and put the power pirates back in business in California. Enron, Reliant (aka Houston Industries), TXU (aka Texas Utilities) and the others who had economically snipped California's wires knew they could count on Dubya, who as governor of the Lone Star state cut them the richest deregulation deal in America.  Meanwhile, the deregulation bug made it to New York where Republican Governor George Pataki and his industry-picked utility commissioners ripped the lid off electric bills and relieved my old friends at Niagara Mohawk of the expensive obligation to properly fund the maintenance of the grid system.   And the Pataki-Bush Axis of Weasels permitted something that must have former New York governor Roosevelt spinning in his wheelchair in Heaven: They allowed a foreign company, the notoriously incompetent National Grid of England, to buy up NiMo, get rid of 800 workers and pocket most of their wages - producing a bonus for NiMo stockholders approaching $90 million.   Is tonight's black-out a surprise? Heck, no, not to us in the field who've watched Bush's buddies flick the switches across the globe. In Brazil, Houston Industries seized ownership of Rio de Janeiro's electric company. The Texans (aided by their French partners) fired workers, raised prices, cut maintenance expenditures and, CLICK! the juice went out so often the locals now call it, "Rio Dark."  So too the free-market cowboys of Niagara Mohawk raised prices, slashed staff, cut maintenance and CLICK! -- New York joins Brazil in the Dark Ages.   Californians have found the solution to the deregulation disaster: re-call the only governor in the nation with the cojones to stand up to the electricity price fixers. And unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger, Gov. Gray Davis stood alone against the bad guys without using a body double. Davis called Reliant Corp of Houston a pack of "pirates" --and now he'll walk the plank for daring to stand up to the Texas marauders.  So where's the President? Just before he landed on the deck of the Abe Lincoln, the White House was so concerned about our brave troops facing the foe that they used the cover of war for a new push in Congress for yet more electricity deregulation. This has a certain logic: there's no sense defeating Iraq if a hostile regime remains in California.  Sitting in the dark, as my laptop battery runs low, I don't know if the truth about deregulation will ever see the light --until we change the dim bulb in the White House.  ----- See Greg Palast's award-winning reports for BBC Television and the Guardian papers of Britain at www.GregPalast.com.

President Eisenhower spoke of the dangers of "undue influence, whether sought or unsought," exerted by the military-industrial complex. Under the Bush/Rove regime, that influence is clearly being sought, as evidenced by the President's use of an aircraft carrier to stage a campaign-style "Top Gun" landing to mark the "cessation of hostilities" in Iraq, and his speech the next day at United Defense, a major weapons maker that is owned by the Carlyle Group, an investment firm that keeps the President's father, George Herbert Walker Bush, on its payroll.

Sources on the ground on the North West Frontier confirmed yesterday that all foreign 'Arabs' had apparently disappeared from their bases in and around Kandahar. Put simply, the enemy has gone."   on the feasibility of militirialization of terrorism  "Still, even the 'Munich Option' has risks.

I have never served in the armed forces in any capacity. My father, however, did. He volunteered for service in Vietnam in 1969. The changes that war wrought upon him have affected, for both good and ill, every single day of my life. Vietnam did not only affect the generation that served there. It affected the children of those who served there, and the families of those who served there. That war is an American heirloom, great and terrible simultaneously, handed down from father to son and from mother to daughter, from father to daughter and from mother to son. The lessons learned there speak to us today, almost thirty years hence.    http://www.truthout.org/docs_03/081003A.shtml

      Former US diplomat says Rumsfeld led Bush to war   ATHENS (AFP) -  A former US diplomat who resigned over the Iraq (news - web sites) war described US President George W. Bush (news - web sites) as a "very weak" man led by the hand into battle by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.       Brady Kiesling, who was political counsellor at the US embassy in Athens at the time of his resignation in February, said in an open letter published by Greek daily To Vima that Rumsfeld exploited the war to increase his own power.          Kiesling -- whose warning that US aims in Iraq were "incompatible with American values" struck a chord with the predominantly anti-war Greeks -- described Bush as "a politician who badly wants to appear strong but in reality is very weak."          He said Rumsfeld led Bush by the hand into war, marginalized the secret services who had doubts about the war, and emerged as the top politician in Washington.          "Easy to convince, (Bush) blindly believed in Rumsfeld's assurances that the occupation of Iraq would pay for itself," Kiesling said.          "The longer we remain in Iraq, the more the resistance to the American presence is going to be a source of legitimacy for the extremists," he said. He called for an expanded role for the United Nations (news - web sites) and the European Union (news - web sites) in the reconstruction of Iraq.          Kiesling said he regretted that US intelligence services had not spoken out about untruths concerning Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, which he added had humiliated the United States and damaged its closest ally, Prime Minister Tony Blair (news - web sites) of Britain.

ATHENS (AFP) -  A former US diplomat who resigned over the Iraq (news - web sites) war described US President George W. Bush (news - web sites) as a "very weak" man led by the hand into battle by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

Kiesling -- whose warning that US aims in Iraq were "incompatible with American values" struck a chord with the predominantly anti-war Greeks -- described Bush as "a politician who badly wants to appear strong but in reality is very weak."          He said Rumsfeld led Bush by the hand into war, marginalized the secret services who had doubts about the war, and emerged as the top politician in Washington.          "Easy to convince, (Bush) blindly believed in Rumsfeld's assurances that the occupation of Iraq would pay for itself," Kiesling said.          "The longer we remain in Iraq, the more the resistance to the American presence is going to be a source of legitimacy for the extremists," he said. He called for an expanded role for the United Nations (news - web sites) and the European Union (news - web sites) in the reconstruction of Iraq.          Kiesling said he regretted that US intelligence services had not spoken out about untruths concerning Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, which he added had humiliated the United States and damaged its closest ally, Prime Minister Tony Blair (news - web sites) of Britain.

                                       FAIR-L                     Fairness & Accuracy In Reporting                Media analysis, critiques and activism  ACTION ALERT: Many Deaths Left Out of Iraq Story  August 19, 2003  With U.S. forces under consistent attack in Iraq, months after George W. Bush declared "major combat" over on May 1, media routinely refer to the number of American soldiers killed.  But many of those reports dramatically undercount the actual number of U.S. deaths since Bush's May 1 address.  A recent NPR report (8/7/03) was typical: "These two deaths bring to 55 the number of U.S. forces killed in combat since May 1st, when President Bush declared major fighting had ended."  A survey of transcripts from some leading broadcast news outlets--ABC World News Tonight, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News and National Public Radio-- found numerous reports that used the same phrasing.  These media are making a distinction-- one rarely explained to audiences-- between combat and non-combat deaths, choosing in most cases to only report the former.  NPR used this formulation earlier this month (8/3/03): "The U.S. has suffered more than 50 combat fatalities since major fighting ended in May."  The following day (8/4/03), it omitted the usual qualifier, rendering the report inaccurate: "So far, 52 American soldiers have died since major combat officially ended in Iraq" (8/4/03).  In reality, the total U.S. dead was about twice that figure, as tallied by the website Iraq Coalition Casualty Count (http://lunaville.org/warcasualties/Summary.aspx).  The broadcast TV networks tend to feature the lower number in their reports as well.  "The total killed since President Bush declared the major combat over: 56 Americans," declared Campbell Brown (NBC Nightly News, 8/8/03).  In another reference to Bush's May 1 speech, ABC's John Cochran reported (World News Tonight, 8/8/03): "Since the president gave that assurance, 59 Americans have been killed, 399 wounded."  CBS Evening News reported (8/8/03) that since Bush's comments, "56 U.S. troops have been killed, including one last night, a guard from the 82nd Airborne, shot while on patrol in Baghdad."  Some might suggest that using a casualty figure that includes non-combat deaths would portray the war as more deadly and dangerous than it really is.  But non-combat fatalities clearly include deaths that are a result of the war; car accidents are often a result of speeding to avoid ambushes, for example, and the heavy battle gear troops are forced to wear contributes to heat-related fatalities.  As Editor & Publisher's Greg Mitchell wrote (7/17/03), "Even if killed in a non-hostile action, these soldiers are no less dead, their families no less aggrieved. And it's safe to say that nearly all of these people would still be alive if they were still back in the States."  In a few unusual reports, news outlets have tallied up all the U.S. military deaths in Iraq.  On July 28, NPR reported that "the number of Americans killed in action since President Bush declared an end to major combat on May 1 now stands at about 50. An equal number of U.S. troops have died from other causes during that time."  In an August 9 report on CBS Evening News, CBS anchor Thalia Assuras reported that "since the proclaimed end of major combat, 119 soldiers have died in the line of duty."  ABC World News Tonight (7/21/03) reported that "95 U.S. troops now have died in Iraq since President Bush declared the end of major combat on May 1st, 38 of them in what the military calls hostile acts" (ABC, 7/21/03).  Iraqi casualties, especially since Bush's May 1 declaration, are barely on the media radar. Most references to life in Iraq since then offer few details on the number of Iraqi dead or injured. "Fifty-four American troops killed in the last 100 days. There's no exact count of the Iraqis killed, or robbed, or raped," reported NBC's Richard Engle (8/9/03). While an exact total is impossible to verify, the website Iraq Body Count (http://www.iraqbodycount.net) lists dozens of Iraqi deaths since May 1, many of whom were killed by U.S. forces.  Asked to describe Iraqi perceptions of the United States, NPR reporter Anne Garrels said: "Rightly or wrongly, Iraqis believe their lives count for little in the eyes of the Americans, who dutifully tally the Americans killed, but give no numbers on Iraqis who were killed, whether they're guilty or innocent" (8/3/03).  While the Iraqis may be right about the higher priority given to U.S. vs. Iraqi deaths, not even all U.S. casualties are being fully acknowledged-- and that shortcoming applies not just to the Pentagon, but to media as well.   ACTION: Contact media outlets and encourage them to report the complete totals for U.S. soldiers who have died in Iraq, and not just those labeled "hostile fire" or "combat" deaths by the Pentagon. Encourage journalists to attempt to count Iraqi losses as well.

       urlLink Powering the People  : "Powering the People    by Jeremy Rifkin  Last week's massive power blackout in the north-east and midwest regions of the US is a reminder that the electrical grid is the central nervous system that coordinates a densely populated urban existence. So how likely is it that the electricity will go off, not just for a brief moment but for extended periods of time? Unfortunately, the power grid is increasingly vulnerable to disruption because of energy shortages and terrorism.    The problem with the existing grid in the US and elsewhere is that each part of the system is so dependent on the rest of the system working that when a single malfunction occurs anywhere, it can result in power loss everywhere. To prevent a repetition of this kind of blackout requires the creation of a decentralised, distributed electricity grid powered by millions of hydrogen fuel cells.   "

       The Bush Administration Adopts a Worse-than-Nixonian Tactic:  The Deadly Serious Crime Of Naming CIA Operatives  By John W. Dean   Friday 15 August 2003   On July 14, in his syndicated column, Chicago Sun-Times journalist Robert Novak reported that Valerie Plame Wilson - the wife of former ambassador Joseph C. Wilson IV, and mother of three-year-old twins - was a covert CIA agent. (She had been known to her friends as an "energy analyst at a private firm.")   Why was Novak able to learn this highly secret information? It turns out that he didn't have to dig for it. Rather, he has said, the "two senior Administration officials" he had cited as sources sought him out, eager to let him know. And in journalism, that phrase is a term of art reserved for a vice president, cabinet officers, and top White House officials.   On July 17, Time magazine published the same story, attributing it to "government officials." And on July 22, Newsday's Washington Bureau confirmed "that Valerie Plame ... works at the agency [CIA] on weapons of mass destruction issues in an undercover capacity." More specifically, according to a "senior intelligence official," Newsday reported, she worked in the "Directorate of Operations [as an] undercover officer."   In other words, Wilson is/was a spy involved in the clandestine collection of foreign intelligence, covert operations and espionage. She is/was part of a elite corps, the best and brightest, and among those willing to take great risk for their country. Now she has herself been placed at great - and needless - risk.   Why is the Administration so avidly leaking this information? The answer is clear. Former ambassador Wilson is famous, lately, for telling the truth about the Bush Administration's bogus claim that Niger uranium had gone to Saddam Hussein. And the Bush Administration is punishing Wilson by targeting his wife. It is also sending a message to others who might dare to defy it, and reveal the truth.   No doubt the CIA, and Mrs. Wilson, have many years, and much effort, invested in her career and skills. Her future, if not her safety, are now in jeopardy.   After reading Novak's column, The Nation's Washington Editor, David Corn, asked, "Did senior Bush officials blow the cover of a US intelligence officer working covertly in a field of vital importance to national security--and break the law--in order to strike at a Bush administration critic and intimidate others?"   The answer is plainly yes. Now the question is, will they get away with it?   Bits and pieces of information have emerged, but the story is far from complete. Nonetheless, what has surfaced is repulsive. If I thought I had seen dirty political tricks as nasty and vile as they could get at the Nixon White House, I was wrong. The American Prospect's observation that "we are very much into Nixon territory here" with this story is an understatement.   Indeed, this is arguably worse. Nixon never set up a hit on one of his enemies' wives.   Leaking the Name of a CIA Agent Is a Crime   On July 22, Ambassador Wilson appeared on the Today show. Katie Couric asked him about his wife: "How damaging would this be to your wife's work?"   Wilson - who, not surprisingly, has refused to confirm or deny that his wife was a CIA operative - answered Katie "hypothetically." He explained, "it would be damaging not just to her career, since she's been married to me, but since they mentioned her by her maiden name, to her entire career. So it would be her entire network that she may have established, any operations, any programs or projects she was working on. It's a--it's a breach of national security. My understanding is it may, in fact, be a violation of American law."   And, indeed, it is.   The Espionage Act of 1917 and the Intelligence Identities and Protection Act of 1982 may both apply. Given the scant facts, it is difficult to know which might be more applicable. But as Senator Schumer (D.NY) said, in calling for an FBI investigation, if the reported facts are true, there has been a crime. The only question is: Whodunit?   The Espionage Act of 1917   The Reagan Administration effectively used the Espionage Act of 1917 to prosecute a leak - to the horror of the news media. It was a case that was instituted to make a point, and establish the law, and it did just that in spades.   In July 1984, Samuel Morrison - the grandson of the eminent naval historian with the same name - leaked three classified photos to Jane's Defense Weekly. The photos were of the Soviet Union's first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, which had been taken by a U.S. spy satellite.   Although the photos compromised no national security secrets, and were not given to enemy agents, the Reagan Administration prosecuted the leak. That raised the question: Must the leaker have an evil purpose to be prosecuted?   The Administration argued that the answer was no. As with Britain's Official Secrets Acts, the leak of classified material alone was enough to trigger imprisonment for up to ten years and fines. And the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit agreed. It held that the such a leak might be prompted by "the most laudable motives, or any motive at all," and it would still be a crime. As a result, Morrison went to jail.   The Espionage Act, though thrice amended since then, continues to criminalize leaks of classified information, regardless of the reason for the leak. Accordingly, the "two senior administration officials" who leaked the classified information of Mrs. Wilson's work at the CIA to Robert Novak (and, it seems, others) have committed a federal crime.   The Intelligence Identities and Protection Act   Another applicable criminal statute is the Intelligence Identities Act, enacted in 1982. The law has been employed in the past. For instance, a low-level CIA clerk was convicted for sharing the identify of CIA employees with her boyfriend, when she was stationed in Ghana. She pled guilty and received a two-year jail sentence. (Other have also been charged with violations, but have pleaded to unrelated counts of the indictment.)   The Act reaches outsiders who engage in "a pattern of activities" intended to reveal the identities of covert operatives (assuming such identities are not public information, which is virtually always the case).   But so far, there is no evidence that any journalist has engaged in such a pattern. Accepting Administration leaks - even repeatedly - should not count as a violation, for First Amendment reasons.   The Act primarily reaches insiders with classified intelligence, those privy to the identity of covert agents. It addresses two kinds of insiders.   First, there are those with direct access to the classified information about the "covert agents." who leak it. These insiders - including persons in the CIA - may serve up to ten years in jail for leaking this information.   Second, there are those who are authorized to have classified information and learn it, and then leak it. These insiders - including persons in, say, the White House or Defense Department - can be sentenced to up to five years in jail for such leaks.   The statute also has additional requirements before the leak of the identity of a "covert agent" is deemed criminal. But it appears they are all satisfied here.   First, the leak must be to a person "not authorized to receive classified information." Any journalist - including Novak and Time - plainly fits.   Second, the insider must know that the information being disclosed identifies a "covert agent." In this case, that's obvious, since Novak was told this fact.   Third, the insider must know that the U.S. government is "taking affirmative measures to conceal such covert agent's intelligence relationship to the United States." For persons with Top Secret security clearances, that's a no-brainer: They have been briefed, and have signed pledges of secrecy, and it is widely known by senior officials that the CIA goes to great effort to keep the names of its agents secret.   A final requirement relates to the "covert agent" herself. She must either be serving outside the United States, or have served outside the United States in the last five years. It seems very likely that Mrs. Wilson fulfills the latter condition - but the specific facts on this point have not yet been reported.   How the Law Protects Covert Agents' Identities   What is not in doubt, is that Mrs. Wilson's identity was classified, and no one in the government had the right to reveal it.   Virtually all the names of covert agents in the CIA are classified, and the CIA goes to some effort to keep them classified. They refuse all Freedom of Information Act requests, they refuse (and courts uphold) to provide such information in discovery connected to lawsuits.   Broadly speaking, covert agents (and their informants) fall under the State Secrets privilege. A federal statute requires that "the Director of Central Intelligence shall be responsible for protecting intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure." It is not, in other words, an option for the CIA to decide to reveal an agent's activities.   And of course, there's are many good reasons for this - relating not only to the agent, but also to national security. As CIA Director Turner explained in a lawsuit in 1982, shortly after the Intelligence Identities Act became law, "In the case of persons acting in the employ of CIA, once their identity is discerned further damage will likely result from the exposure of other intelligence collection efforts for which they were used."   The White House's Unusual Stonewalling About an Obvious Leak   In the past, Bush and Cheney have gone ballistic when national security information leaked. But this leak - though it came from "two senior administration officials" - has been different. And that, in itself, speaks volumes.   On July 22, White House press secretary Scott McClellan was asked about the Novak column. Offering only a murky, non-answer, he claimed that neither "this President or this White House operates" in such a fashion. He added, "there is absolutely no information that has come to my attention or that I have seen that suggests that there is any truth to that suggestion. And, certainly, no one in this White House would have given authority to take such a step."   So was McClellan saying that Novak was lying - and his sources were not, in fact, "two senior administration officials"? McClellan dodged, kept repeating his mantra, and refused to respond.   Later, McClellan was asked, "Would the President support an investigation into the blowing of the cover on an undercover CIA operative?" Again, he refused to acknowledge "that there might be some truth to the matter you're bringing up." When pressed further, he said he would have to look into "whether or not that characterization is accurate when you're talking about someone's cover."   McClellan's statement that he would have to look into the matter was disingenuous at best. This ten-day old column by Novak had not escaped the attention of the White House. Indeed, when the question was first raised, McClellan immediately responded, "Thank you for bringing that up."   As David Corn has pointed out, what McClellan did not say, is even more telling than what he said. He did not say he was trying to get to the bottom of the story and determine if it had any basis in fact. He did not say the president would not tolerate such activities, and was demanding to know what had happened.   Indeed, as Corn points out, McClellan's remarks "hardly covered a message from Bush to his underlings: don't you dare pull crap like this." Indeed, they could even be seen as sending a message that such crimes will be overlooked.   Frankly, I am astounded that the President of the United States - whose father was once Director of the CIA - did not see fit to have his Press Secretary address this story with hard facts. Nor has he apparently called for an investigation - or even given Ambassador and Mrs. Wilson a Secret Service detail, to let the world know they will be protected.   This is the most vicious leak I have seen in over 40 years of government-watching. Failure to act to address it will reek of a cover-up or, at minimum, approval of the leak's occurrence - and an invitation to similar revenge upon Administration critics.   Congressional Calls For Investigation Should Be Heeded   Senator Dick Durbin (D - IL) was the first to react. On July 22, he delivered a lengthy speech about how the Bush Administration was using friendly reporters to attack its enemies. He knew this well, because he was one of those being so attacked.   "Sadly, what we have here," Durbin told his colleagues, "is a continuing pattern by this White House. If any Member of this Senate - Democrat or Republican - takes to the floor, questions this White House policy, raises any questions about the gathering of intelligence information, or the use of it, be prepared for the worst. This White House is going to turn on you and attack you."   After Senator Durbin set forth the evidence that showed the charges of the White House against him were false, he turned to the attacks on Ambassador and Mrs. Wilson. He announced that he was asking the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Intelligence Committee to investigate this "extremely serious matter."   "In [the Administration's] effort to seek political revenge against Ambassador Wilson," Durbin said, "they are now attacking him and his wife, and doing it in a fashion that is not only unacceptable, it may be criminal. And that, frankly, is as serious as it gets in this town."   The House Intelligence Committee is also going to investigate the Wilson leak. "What happened is very dangerous to a person who may be a CIA operative," Congressman Alcee Hastings (D - FL), a member of the Committee, said. And the committee's chairman, Porter Gross (R- FL), a former CIA agent himself, said an investigation "could be part of a wider" look that his committee is taking at WMD issues.   In a July 24 letter to FBI Director William Mueller, Senator Charles Schumer (D -NY) demanded a criminal investigation of the leak. Schumer's letter stated, "If the facts that have been reported publicly are true, it is clear that a crime was committed. The only questions remaining to be answered are who committed the crime and why?"   The FBI, too, has confirmed that they are undertaking an investigation.   But no one should hold their breath. So far, Congress has treated the Bush Administration with kid gloves. Absent an active investigation by a grand jury, under the direction of a U.S. Attorney or special prosecutor, an FBI investigation is not likely to accomplish anything. After all, the FBI does not have power to compel anyone to talk. And unless the President himself demands a full investigation, the Department of Justice is not going to do anything - unless the Congress uncovers information that embarrasses them into taking action.   While this case is a travesty, it won't be the first one that this administration has managed to get away with. Given the new the nadir of investigative journalism, this administration has been emboldened. And why not? Lately, the mainstream media has seemed more interested in stockholders than readers. If Congress won't meaningfully investigate these crimes - and, indeed, even if it will - it is the press's duty to do so. Let us hope it fulfills that duty. But I am not holding my breath about that, either.

      Subject: "Hero in War and Peace" (from Gush Shalom)   GUSH SHALOM  pob 3322, Tel-Aviv 61033 www.gush- shalom.org  [Avnery confronts the Defence Minister with a piece of "remembered history", and learned something new himself, about how he unknowingly had once saved the life of Moshe Dayan. Find in the end also the text of two ads published by Gush Shalom.]  Uri Avnery 16.8.03          "Hero in War and Peace"  Sometimes a single sentence is enough to reveal a persons mental world and intellectual profundity. Such a sentence was uttered by Shaul Mofaz, the Minister of Defense, some days ago during a visit to the Israeli troops in the Gaza Strip.  "With our enemies, it seems, no shortcuts are possible. Egypt made peace with Israel only after it was defeated in the Yom Kippur War. That will happen with the Palestinians, too."  This means that there is no political solution. There is only war, and in this war we must "defeat" the Palestinians. A simple, simplistic, not to say primitive, view.  But the revealing sentence is: "Egypt made peace with Israel only after it was defeated in the Yom Kippur War".  Revealing, because it utterly contradicts the almost unanimous view of all the experts in Israel and around the world -- historians, Arabists and military commentators. These believe that the exact opposite is true: Anwar Sadat was able to lead Egypt towards peace only because he was admired as the commander who had defeated Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Only after the Egyptian people had won back their national pride were they able to consider peace with the enemy (with us).  When the war broke out, the Egyptians did something that amazed the world and shook Israel: they crossed the Suez Canal and overcame the celebrated "Bar-Lev line". Everybody considered this a brilliant military feat. The stupidity of Israeli army intelligence and the arrogant complacency of Prime Minister Golda Meir allowed the Egyptians to achieve total surprise, destroy a large number of tanks and pin down the Israeli Air force. The Minister of Defense, Moshe Dayan, was in shock and talked about the "destruction of the third Jewish state". (In traditional Jewish historiography, the first two Jewish states are symbolized by the first and second temple in Jerusalem.)  In the course of the war, the tide turned and, in the end, the Israeli army crossed the Canal into Egypt. At the end of the war, Israeli troops were established on the western shore, but large Egyptian forces remained to their rear, on the eastern side. This week a long- delayed official study by the Israeli army was leaked. It declares unequivocally that Israel had 'not won that war'.  But the professional military analysis is not so important in this context. What is important is how the events appear to the Egyptian consciousness and affect their actions since then.  I succeeded in reaching Cairo on the morrow of Sadats sensational visit to Jerusalem, and found myself in a city drunk with joy, in some kind of delirious popular carnival. Over the main streets stretched hundreds of slogans celebrating the act of the president. Every commercial corporation felt duty-bound to hang such a slogan with a peace message.  The one slogan that outnumbered all others was "Anwar Sadat: Hero of War and Peace".  The Egyptian people would not have supported peace, if they had considered it a surrender to the diktat of an arrogant enemy. Only the crossing of the Canal four years earlier, which Egyptians consider one of the greatest victories in all the 8000 years of their history, enabled them to accept the agreement as a compromise between equals, without loss of honor. Like many other nations, the Egyptians -- and all other Arabs -- consider national dignity the most important treasure.  Perhaps Mofaz should go to Cairo and visit the round building that houses the museum of the Ramadan War (as Arabs call the Yom Kippur War). There he will see an exciting, emotion-laden display of the crossing of the Canal. Every day the place is thronged with people, especially school-children.  If one wants to draw a parallel between the Egyptians and the Palestinians, as Mofaz tries to do, the conclusion would be: only after the Palestinians win back their national self-respect, will they be able to make peace with Israel. The first intifada, which Palestinians consider a victorious struggle against the immense might of the Israeli army, allowed them to accept the Oslo agreement. Only the second intifada, which has already proved that the Israeli army cannot subdue the Palestinian uprising, enabled them to accept the Road Map, which is supposed to bring about peace between the Israeli and the coming Palestinian state.  On a related topic: On the eve of the thirtieth anniversary of the Yom Kippur War, Israeli newspapers are full of revelations about it. Among them is the disclosure that I saved the life of Moshe Dayan. That surprised me, as it would have surprised Dayan, if he were still living. But it appears to be true.  The facts are revealed by Amir Porat, the former communication officer and personal confidant of Shmuel Gonen (universally known as "Gorodish"), who was in charge of Southern Command during the war. Later, when the public was looking for a scapegoat for the terrible initial defeat, the main blame was put on Gorodish. He was dismissed from his command and nobody was prepared to listen to his side of the story. All the media boycotted him.  This man, who practically overnight had fallen from the height of glory (as one of the heroes of the 1967 Six Day War) to the depths of ignominy, was in despair. He blamed Dayan for the injustice done to him. In the end he made an appointment with him, planning to shoot him and then himself.  At the very last moment, one day before the fateful meeting, Haolam Hazeh correspondent Rino Tzror arranged a meeting between us. At the time I was editor-in-chief this newsmagazine, the only medium in the country that was truly independent of the establishment. We had a reputation for supporting the underdog and challenging the powers that be. I talked with him at length. During the whole conversation he toyed with his pistol.  Gorodish was very far from my political views, he was a right-wing person, an out-and-out militarist, but I became convinced that the official inquiry into the war had indeed done him a shocking injustice. Therefore I promised to help him getting his side of the story across. He saw that the whole world was not closed to him. Having someone listening to his side of the story and promising to publish it relieved his despair and made him give up the idea of killing Dayan and committing suicide. I published a large article under the headline "The Israeli Dreyfus".  This affair has its ironic side. In the whole of Israel, no one was more opposed to Dayan than I. More than anyone else (except Ben- Gurion and his sidekick, Shimon Peres) Dayan laid down in the 1950s the anti- Arab tracks on which Israel is moving to this very day. In the pages of Haolam Hazeh I attacked him relentlessly, writing hundreds of articles against him, exposing his illegal traffic in stolen archeological finds and his private peccadilloes that endangered the security of the state. And in the end it appears that I saved his life.  Back to the main point: The Yom Kippur War did not lead to the "destruction of the third state", as Dayan had prophesied, but to peace with Egypt, after its national honor had been restored. If Sharon and the army command succeed in disrupting the hudna (truce) and bring about the renewal of the intifada, they will not break the Palestinians, who will refuse to submit. And after large-scale bloodshed, Yasser Arafat will make a speech in the Knesset, as did Sadat, the "Hero of War and Peace".  \\// //\\ \\// //\\ \\//  [weekly ad - Haaretz, August 15]          WHO MADE THE DECISION?  Question: Who gave the order to carry out the "targeted killing" in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, killing four people? And, after that, who gave the order to kill the Jihad militant in Hebron? Everybody knew that these executions would be followed by acts of revenge, and that the hudna (truce) was liable to be shattered.  The hudna is like a bicycle: either you move forward or you fall.  Instead of taking advantage of the hudna in order to come closer to a political solution, the Sharon government avoids any positive step: it releases prisoners who were about to be release anyhow, leaves hundreds of checkpoints in place and removes three for the cameras, continues to build the Choking Wall and threatens to open the Temple Mount by force.  But if the hudna will collapse -- who will be blamed?  [special ad Haaretz - August 15]              TWO STATES -- ONE COMMON FUTURE  In view of Sharons tricks, it is important to state again:  There is no solution to the conflict other than the establishment of Israeli-Palestinian peace based on the co-existence of two independent and sovereign states, the State of Israel and the State of Palestine, on either side of the Green Line, with their capitals in Jerusalem.  Gush Shalom, one of the pioneers of the idea of "Two States for Two Peoples", believes that this is the realistic solution for the historic conflict.  We reject categorically Sharons policy of deceit. He talks about "an end to the occupation" and "a Palestinian state" -- when all he means is Palestinian enclaves, cut off from each other, on half the area of the West Bank.  We shall continue to fight against the building of the 'separation wall' that is designed to realize this aim of the Sharon government.  Peace -- Not Occupation!  Partnership -- Not Separation!

Please sign their appeal, sending your name, title and the name of your organization if applicable, your community and country to jglan21@yahoo.com or to humanrights@korea.com. PLEASE also forward this appeal to everyone you know who you think might be interested in seeing and supporting it.  With U.S., North Korean and other leaders now scheduled to meet in Beijing on August 27, it is time to do whatever we can to build and demonstrate a global tide demanding that the U.S.-North Korean nuclear crisis be resolved diplomatically.  Thank you for your support.  Work for peace, Joseph Gerson American Friends Service Committee    Dear friends,  Greetings from Seoul!  HOPING YOU CAN SIGN THIS STATEMENT.  Eleven South Korean NGOs including women's, peace, environmental, worker's groups made "An International Appeal to Oppose War Provocation in Korea and to Resolve North Korean Issue by Peaceful Means". We are collecting signs of people who support the appeal from Korea and around the world.  After we collect signs, we shall send this statement and signs to political leaders of countries concerned with 6 party talks - two Koreas, the US, China, Russia and Japan. We shall receive signs until August 20. The talks will take place for three days between August 25 and August 31.  Could you sign the international appeal? If so, Korean NGOs will be encouraged by your support to build peace on the Korean peninsula.  To sign, please reply to jglan21@yahoo.com or humanrights@korea.com, ensuring that you include your name, position, name of your organization, and your country and city.  My apologies if you receive many copies of this - I am sending it out to many lists and some of you are on more than one list. Please delete excess copies.  Attached is "An International Appeal to Oppose War Provocation in Korea and to Resolve North Korean Issue by Peaceful Means".  Thank you. Yours in peace,  Gyung-Lan Jung Women Making Peace National Council for Peace on the Korean Peninsula     Stop War Planning and Start Peace Talks An International Appeal to Oppose War Provocation in Korea and to Resolve North Korean Issue by Peaceful Means  For the past five decades, the horror of war has constantly dominated Korea, instilling mistrust, hatred, and confrontation in the people living in North or South Korea alike. This quasi war-state has also frustrated the efforts they have made to develop a peaceful Korea and a peaceful world. The era of confrontation must end now. As we mark the 50th anniversary of the armistice of the Korean War, we invite you to proclaim with us a Jubilee of Peace, a year marking the start of a new epoch of peace and reconciliation, coexistence and prosperity in Northeast Asia. The peoples of Korea and the world demand that the armistice be replaced with a peace treaty as a way to end the current confrontation and build a cooperative relationship.  The peoples wishes notwithstanding, a danger of war looms large over the Korean Peninsula at the moment. The conflict is between the US administration demanding unconditional dismantlement of the North Koreas nuclear program and North Korean government refusing it for a security guarantee. Attempts to resolve this issue by threats and sanctions have only escalated the tension, leading to the de facto annulment of the 1994 Geneva agreement that had sustained a hope for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. This year the tension between the two sides has ascended to an unprecedented level, making war a real possibility.  Military means cannot be a solution to the current dispute. The nuclear and security issues between North Korea and the US should and can be resolved by peaceful means. The forthcoming six-nation talk on the issue, once deemed impossible to many, can be a starting point for a new direction. We, NGOs and peace groups in South Korea and around the world, make the following appeals to everyone who denounces war as a way to peace:  - The dispute between the US and North Korean governments must be resolved only by peaceful means. For this the US, North Korea and all other parties involved in the forthcoming multilateral talk should engage in a dialogue with a genuine commitment to peace. Threats of containment or use of force should be excluded from the negotiating table, as such threats have only obstructed meaningful talks in the past.  - We oppose the development, deployment or use of nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula. On the basis of this non-nuclear principle, we oppose North Koreas nuclear weapons programs as well as the US deployment and use of nuclear weapons in the Korean peninsula. The denuclearization agreement of the two Koreas must be respected by all states, and the US must clearly denunciate its nuclear first-strike policy.  - The current crisis should be resolved by a package deal where the U.S. provides for a security guarantee and the lifting of economic sanctions to North Korea in return for the Norths freeze of all nuclear weapons programs. South Korea and neighbouring countries need to support and guarantee the commitments made in the package deal while North Korea is required to conduct earnest dialogues with her neighbours. Only by replacing the armistice with a peace treaty, can the sources of the continued military confrontation as well as the sources of future conflict be removed once and for all.  - We believe that any policy regarding Korean future must take into consideration Korean peoples views and hopes. It should be clearly noted that the Koreans desire no war but reconciliation, cooperation, peace building and reunification between two Koreas. We welcome the proposed six-party talk as a diplomatic success jointly achieved by the governments of North Korea, the US, China and others. This frame of talk should serve as a venue of resolving the prolonged conflict in such a way as to fulfil the peace wishes of the Koreans.  A deadly arms race is on the horizon in Northeast Asia. The US has adopted a nuclear first-strike posture, is promoting high-tech weapons systems such as the missile defence, and is increasing its military presence in the region. Using the North Korean crisis as a justification, Japan is bolstering its military capability while dismantling legal constraints on its military activities. China and South Korea continue with their military modernization programs. This trend should be stopped now. Otherwise it will soon create an insane arms race that will doom the prospect of peace in the region and the world. We urge the governments in the region to realize the danger of this trend and to start immediately working together towards security cooperation and disarmament.  Recognising the tremendous positive effect that the peace-loving peoples of the world have made in preventing war, we are determined to continue to cooperate with them to bring a peaceful resolution to the current crisis not only as a way to bring peace to the Korean peninsula but also as a way to contribute to building a peaceful world. We appeal to everyone to work together for the world where peace and co-prosperity prevail over war threats.

      In This Issue: Noam Chomsky on America's Past 11 Months  Subscription/Unsubscription: See end of this message. Please do not reply to this message - instead, direct correspondence to magazine@tikkun.org  Noam Chomsky on America's Past 11 Months  When thinking about the way the media distorts Americans' perception of our political world, it sometimes makes sense to step back and try to assess the larger picture. Noam Chomsky's analysis below ignores the hunger of the world's people for a world based on justice, peace and generosity. This kind of macro-analysis makes invisible the peace movements and the attempts to organize alternatives to the established systems of poweralmost the flip side of the way those movements get "disappeared" when viewed by establishment media. Yet the self-marginalizing done by those who aligned themselves with International A.N.S.W.E.R. and the kind of mass demonstrations this past year that bespoke a movement that knew what it was against but never put forward a positive vision as an alternative may make Chomsky's approach more reasonable in the actual circumstances of 2003.  We at Tikkun seek to explore the ways that ordinary people could interact with and shape the outcome of some of the scheming that Chomsky loves to highlight in his analyses. We also believe that the seeming invincibility that these systems project and which are highlighted in Chomsky's analysis can actually be more effectively pierced by social movements that name the highest ethical and spiritual and psychological needs of human beings that this kind of macro-analysis renders invisible. Yet even as we question the adequacy of Chomsky's analysis, we at the same time want to acknowledge the brilliance of his capacity to capture large pictures, his compelling way of putting information together, and to salute as well a human being who has played an important and valuable role as a critic of the arrogance and moral blindness of those who have been running American policies for many decades. And we think that this particular account, if partial, is nevertheless very compelling and worthy of serious national discussion. Ask the next person who asks for your vote for any public office to first read and comment on this (and then, ask them also if they will sign the Resolution for Middle East Peace at www.tikkun.org   ). You might get a better sense of what that person really stands for with those two requests.  Jihad Unspun  Aug 16, 2003 by Noam Chomsky  September 2002 was marked by three events of considerable importance, closely related. The United States, the most powerful state in history, announced a new national security strategy asserting that it will maintain global hegemony permanently. Any challenge will be blocked by force, the dimension in which the US reigns supreme. At the same time, the war drums began to beat to mobilise the population for an invasion of Iraq . And the campaign opened for the mid-term congressional elections, which would determine whether the administration would be able to carry forward its radical international and domestic agenda.  The new "imperial grand strategy", as it was termed at once by John Ikenberry writing in the leading establishment journal, presents the US as "a revisionist state seeking to parlay its momentary advantages into a world order in which it runs the show", a unipolar world in which "no state or coalition could ever challenge it as global leader, protector, and enforcer" (1). These policies are fraught with danger even for the US itself, Ikenberry warned, joining many others in the foreign policy elite.  What is to be protected is US power and the interests it represents, not the world, which vigorously opposed the concept. Within a few months studies revealed that fear of the US had reached remarkable heights, along with distrust of the political leadership. An international Gallup poll in December, which was barely noticed in the US, found almost no support for Washington's announced plans for a war in Iraq carried out unilaterally by America and its alliesin effect, the US-United Kingdom coalition.  Washington told the United Nations that it could be relevant by endorsing US plans, or it could be a debating society. The US had the "sovereign right to take military action", the administration's moderate Colin Powell told the World Economic Forum, which also vigorously opposed the war plans: "When we feel strongly about something we will lead, even if no one is following us" (2).  President George Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair underscored their contempt for international law and institutions at their Azores summit meeting on the eve of the invasion. They issued an ultimatum, not to Iraq, but to the Security Council: capitulate, or we will invade without your meaningless seal of approval. And we will do so whether or not Saddam Hussein and his family leave the country (3). The crucial principle is that the US must effectively rule Iraq.  President Bush declared that the US "has the sovereign authority to use force in assuring its own national security," threatened by Iraq with or without Saddam, according to the Bush doctrine. The US will be happy to establish an Arab facade, to borrow the term of the British during their days in the sun, while US power is firmly implanted at the heart of the world's major energy-producing region. Formal democracy will be fine, but only if it is of a submissive kind accepted in the US 's backyard, at least if history and current practice are any guide.  The grand strategy authorises the US to carry out preventive war: preventive, not pre-emptive. Whatever the justifications for pre-emptive war might be, they do not hold for preventive war, particularly as that concept is interpreted by its current enthusiasts: the use of military force to eliminate an invented or imagined threat, so that even the term "preventive" is too charitable. Preventive war is, very simply, the supreme crime that was condemned at Nuremberg .  That was understood by those with some concern for their country. As the US invaded Iraq , the historian Arthur Schlesinger wrote that Bush's grand strategy was "alarmingly similar to the policy that imperial Japan employed at the time of Pearl Harbor, on a date which, as an earlier American president [Franklin D. Roosevelt] said it would, lives in infamy." It was no surprise, added Schlesinger, that "the global wave of sympathy that engulfed the US after 9/11 has given way to a global wave of hatred of American arrogance and militarism" and the belief that Bush was "a greater threat to peace than Saddam Hussein" (4).  For the political leadership, mostly recycled from the more reactionary sectors of the Reagan-Bush Senior administrations, the global wave of hatred is not a particular problem. They want to be feared, not loved. It is natural for the Secretary of Defence, Donald Rumsfeld, to quote the words of Chicago gangster Al Capone: "You will get more with a kind word and a gun than with a kind word alone." They understand just as well as their establishment critics that their actions increase the risk of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and terror. But that too is not a major problem. Far higher in the scale of their priorities are the goals of establishing global hegemony and implementing their domestic agenda, which is to dismantle the progressive achievements that have been won by popular struggle over the past century, and to institutionalise their radical changes so that recovering the achievements will be no easy task.  It is not enough for a hegemonic power to declare an official policy. It must establish it as a new norm of international law by exemplary action. Distinguished commentators may then explain that the law is a flexible living instrument, so that the new norm is now available as a guide to action. It is understood that only those with the guns can establish norms and modify international law.  The selected target must meet several conditions. It must be defenceless, important enough to be worth the trouble, an imminent threat to our survival and an ultimate evil. Iraq qualified on all counts. The first two conditions are obvious. For the third, it suffices to repeat the orations of Bush, Blair, and their colleagues: the dictator "is assembling the world's most dangerous weapons [in order to] dominate, intimidate or attack;" and he "has already used them on whole villages leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind or transfigured. If this is not evil then evil has no meaning." Bush's eloquent denunciation surely rings true. And those who contributed to enhancing evil should certainly not enjoy impunity: among them, the speaker of these lofty words and his current associates, and all those who joined them in the years when they were supporting that man of ultimate evil, Saddam Hussein, long after he had committed these terrible crimes, and after the first war with Iraq. Supported him because of our duty to help US exporters, the Bush Senior administration explained.  It is impressive to see how easy it is for political leaders, while recounting Saddam the monster's worst crimes, to suppress the crucial words "with our help, because we don't care about such matters." Support shifted to denunciation as soon as their friend Saddam committed his first authentic crime, which was disobeying (or perhaps misunderstanding) orders, by invading Kuwait. Punishment was severefor his subjects. The tyrant escaped unscathed, and was further strengthened by the sanctions regime then imposed by his former allies.  Also easy to suppress are the reasons why the US returned to support Saddam immediately after the Gulf war, as he crushed rebellions that might have overthrown him. The chief diplomatic correspondent of the New York Times, Thomas Friedman, explained that the best of all worlds for the US would be "an iron-fisted Iraqi junta without Saddam Hussein," but since that goal seemed unattainable, we would have to be satisfied with second best (5). The rebels failed because the US and its allies held the "strikingly unanimous view [that] whatever the sins of the Iraqi leader, he offered the West and the region a better hope for his country's stability than did those who have suffered his repression" (6).  All of this was suppressed in the commentary on the mass graves of the victims of the US-authorised paroxysm of terror of Saddam Hussein, which commentary was offered as a justification for the war on "moral grounds". It was all known in 1991, but ignored for reasons of state.  A reluctant US population had to be whipped to a proper mood of war fever. >From September grim warnings were issued about the dire threat that Saddam posed to the US and his links to al-Qaida, with broad hints that he had been involved in the 9/11 attacks. Many of the charges that had been "dangled in front of [the media] failed the laugh test," commented the editor of the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, "but the more ridiculous [they were,] the more the media strove to make whole-hearted swallowing of them a test of patriotism" (7). The propaganda assault had its effects. Within weeks, a majority of Americans came to regard Saddam Hussein as an imminent threat to the US . Soon almost half believed that Iraq was behind the 9/11 terror. Support for the war correlated with these beliefs. The propaganda campaign was just enough to give the administration a bare majority in the mid-term elections, as voters put aside their immediate concerns and huddled under the umbrella of power in fear of a demonic enemy.  The brilliant success of public diplomacy was revealed when Bush, in the words of one commentator, "provided a powerful Reaganesque finale to a six-week war on the deck of the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln on 1 May." This reference is presumably to President Ronald Reagan's proud declaration that America was "standing tall" after conquering Grenada, the nutmeg capital of the world, in 1983, preventing the Russians from using it to bomb the US. Bush, as Reagan's mimic, was free to declarewithout concern for sceptical comment at homethat he had won a "victory in a war on terror [by having] removed an ally of al-Qaida" (8). It has been immaterial that no credible evidence was provided for the alleged link between Saddam Hussein and his bitter enemy Osama bin Laden and that the charge was dismissed by competent observers. Also immaterial was the only known connection between the victory and terror: the invasion appears to have been "a huge setback in the war on terror" by sharply increasing al-Qaida recruitment, as US officials concede (9).  The Wall Street Journal recognised that Bush's carefully staged aircraft carrier extravaganza "marks the beginning of his 2004 re-election campaign" which the White House hopes "will be built as much as possible around national-security themes." The electoral campaign will focus on "the battle of Iraq , not the war," chief Republican political strategist Karl Rove explained: the war must continue, if only to control the population at home (10).  Before the 2002 elections Rove had instructed party activists to stress security issues, diverting attention from unpopular Republican domestic policies. All of this is second-nature to the recycled Reaganites now in office. That is how they held on to political power during their first tenure in office. They regularly pushed the panic button to avoid public opposition to the policies that had left Reagan as the most disliked living president by 1992, by which time he may have ranked even lower than Richard Nixon.  Despite its narrow successes, the intensive propaganda campaign left the public unswayed in fundamental respects. Most continue to prefer UN rather than US leadership in international crises, and by two to one prefer that the UN, rather than the US , should direct reconstruction in Iraq (11).  When the occupying coalition army failed to discover WMD, the US administration's stance shifted from absolute certainty that Iraq possessed WMD to the position that the accusations were "justified by the discovery of equipment that potentially could be used to produce weapons" (12). Senior officials then suggested a refinement in the concept of preventive war, to entitle the US to attack a country that has "deadly weapons in mass quantities." The revision "suggests that the administration will act against a hostile regime that has nothing more than the intent and ability to develop WMD" (13). Lowering the criteria for a resort to force is the most significant consequence of the collapse of the proclaimed argument for the invasion.  Perhaps the most spectacular propaganda achievement was the praising of Bush's vision to bring democracy to the Middle East in the midst of an extraordinary display of hatred and contempt for democracy. This was illustrated by the distinction that was made by Washington between Old and New Europe, the former being reviled and the latter hailed for its courage. The criterion was sharp: Old Europe consists of governments that took the same position over the war on Iraq as most of their populations; while the heroes of New Europe followed orders from Crawford, Texas, disregarding, in most cases, an even larger majority of citizens who were against the war. Political commentators ranted about disobedient Old Europe and its psychic maladies, while Congress descended to low comedy.  At the liberal end of the spectrum, the former US ambassador to the UN, Richard Holbrooke, stressed the "very important point" that the population of the eight original members of New Europe is larger than that of Old Europe, which proves that France and Germany are "isolated". So it does, unless we succumb to the radical-left heresy that the public might have some role in a democracy. Thomas Friedman then urged that France be removed from the permanent members of the Security Council, because it is "in kindergarten, and does not play well with others". It follows that the population of New Europe must still be in nursery school, at least judging by the polls (14).  Turkey was a particularly instructive case. Its government resisted the heavy pressure from the US to prove its democratic credentials by following US orders and overruling 95% of its population. Turkey did not cooperate. US commentators were infuriated by this lesson in democracy, so much so that some even reported Turkey's crimes against the Kurds in the 1990s, previously a taboo topic because of the crucial US role in what happened, although that was still carefully concealed in the lamentations.  The crucial point was expressed by the deputy Secretary of Defence, Paul Wolfowitz, who condemned the Turkish military because they "did not play the strong leadership role that we would have expected"that is they did not intervene to prevent the Turkish government from honouring near-unanimous public opinion. Turkey had therefore to step up and say, "We made a mistakelet's figure out how we can be as helpful as possible to the Americans" (15). Wolfowitz's stand was particularly informative because he had been portrayed as the leading figure in the administration's crusade to democratise the Middle East .  Anger at Old Europe has much deeper roots than just contempt for democracy. The US has always regarded European unification with some ambivalence. In his "Year of Europe" address 30 years ago, Henry Kissinger advised Europeans to keep to their regional responsibilities within the "overall framework of order managed by the US ." Europe must not pursue its own independent course, based on its Franco-German industrial and financial heartland.  The US administration's concerns now extend as well to Northeast Asia, the world's most dynamic economic region, with ample resources and advanced industrial economies, a potentially integrated region that might also flirt with challenging the overall framework of world order, which is to be maintained permanently, by force if necessary, Washington has declared.

The largest are richer than entire nations, and courts have given these entities more rights than people. To many Americans, corporate power seems out of control. According to a Business Week/Harris poll released in September 2000, 82 percent of those surveyed agreed that business has too much power over too many aspects of our lives. And the recent revelations of corporate scandal and political influence have only added to such concerns.                                                           Where did this powerful institution come from? How did it get so much power?

      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:August 29, 2003      FOR MORE INFORMATION: Rania Masri: 919-604-7777 rania@southernstudies.org Chris Kromm: 919-419-8311 x26chris@southernstudies.org    CONGRESS MUST INVESTIGATE WAR PROFITEERING BY HALLIBURTON AND OTHER BUSH-CONNECTED CORPORATIONS  Newly-launched Campaign to Stop the War Profiteers says recent revelations of secrecy, ballooning tax-payer funded contracts underscores need for action  DURHAM, N.C.  News reports yesterday that Bush-connected corporations Halliburton Co. and Bechtel are receiving billions of dollars in no-bid, insider contracts for Iraq reconstruction  including contracts previously kept from the public, and budget-busting increases on past contracts  demands immediate action by Congress to investigate and put an end to war profiteering, according to the newly-launched Campaign to Stop the War Profiteers.  Its more clear than ever that a handful of big corporations with close ties to the Bush Administration are making hundreds of millions of dollars off the death and destruction of war, all at taxpayer expense, says Rania Masri, a program director at the non-profit Institute for Southern Studies and co-director of the Campaign. Thats war profiteering, and it needs to stop.  The Campaign, launched by the Institute earlier this month, has quickly galvanized veteran, peace, and other public interest groups across the country. Veterans for Peace, New York Labor Against the War, Peace Action, and other leading organizations have signed on to the campaign, as well as national progressive luminaries Noam Chomsky, Bill Fletcher, Jim Hightower, Naomi Klein, and Howard Zinn.  Yesterdays reports concerning Halliburton (Washington Post) and Bechtel (Wall Street Journal) revealed vital new information about the scope of insider deals and war profiteering, including:  n TheWashington Post reports that As much as one-third of the monthly $3.9 billion cost of keeping U.S. troops in Iraq is being handed out to for-profit, big business contractors, led by Halliburton and Bechtel  both major contributors to and allies of the Bush Administration.  n Halliburton, including its subsidiary Brown and Root, has been handed contracts worth more than $1.7 billion  and stands to make hundreds of millions more, mostly under contracts in which other companies were not allowed to bid. At least one contract had not previously publicly acknowledged by the Pentagon. (WashingtonPost)  n According to theWall Street Journal, Bechtels Iraq contract was increased by $350 million  more than 50%  on top of the $680 million already given to the company in a secret, no-bid contract. Bechtel has former board members, former and current VPs and Presidents, the current CEO, and friends with seats in the Presidents Export Council, the Defense Policy Board, Committee for the Liberation of Iraq, USAID, the CIA, and several other government agencies.  Ever since Halliburton received a secret, unlimited contract for logistical support operations in 2001 for the war on terror, its been clear that Bush-connected corporations have had an inside track, said Chris Kromm, director of the Institute and a coordinator with the campaign.  When Halliburton reports that the companys profits jumped $26 million in the second quarter of 2003 while the rest of the economy is stalling, its also clear theyre making a killing off the business of war, Kromm added.  Campaign organizers say the recent revelations of war profiteering add urgency to demands the Campaign set our earlier this month, including:  nCONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ON WAR PROFITEERING: Congress should convene hearings immediately to investigate the scope of war profiteering, modeled on hearings in the 1930s by Sen. Gerald Nye or during World War II by Sen. Harry Truman.  nSTOP CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AND DIRTY CONTRACTS: As part of its investigation, Congress should examine and implement measures against conflicts of interest between companies receiving contracts and Administration leaders. Contracts should also only go to companies with clean business records  unlike Halliburton, which is under SEC investigation for financial scandals, has been accused of running up $2.2 billion in over-charges for previous contracts, and has yet to explain its business dealings in Iraq during the 1990s, when the country was supposedly under sanctions.  nREIGN IN PROFITEERING THROUGH AN EXCESS PROFITS TAX: As contractors rake in billions of dollars in profits from military contracts  such as the $490 million in taxpayer-funded profits promised to Halliburton injust one contract the Campaign demands that Congress reinstate the Excess Profits Tax. Such taxes to stop undue profiting from military contracts were levied during the Civil War, both World Wars, and the Korean War.  Tara Purohit, an Institute associate working on the campaign, noted that during World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said I dont want to see a single war millionaire created in the United States as a result of this disaster, and then-Senator Harry Truman denounced war profiteering as treason. Earlier in the century, Sen. Robert LaFollette called war profiteers enemies of democracy in the homeland.  Our country has a proud history of leaders who have stood up to the war profiteers, said Purohit. Now its time for todays leaders to stand up to the new merchants of misery and corporate war looters.

Members of the 'Bring Them Home Now' campaign told reporters that President Bush lied about reasons for going to war. No weapons of mass destruction have been found and Bush has not proved a link between former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and the al-Qaida terrorists, the group said.  And U.S. soldiers have become targets of Iraqis who consider them invaders, not liberators. The Pentagon said 267 troops have died in Iraq as of Aug. 13, including 58 from hostile fire after Bush declared major hostilities ended May 1.  'The war was supposed to be over,' said Kathy Powell, of Conesville. 'After what happened yesterday, I was so upset, I cried. I'm very angry and bitter.' "

The answer to our woes, the Times informs us, is more deregulation -- except for the visionary rules contained in the President's energy bill. In the editorial posing as a news story, the Times lectures us that the president's proposals would have been law, and saved us from the power outage, 'but politics have stymied their progress.'

      August 28, 2003   Bush's Old Tricks    When George W. Bush gave his speech at the favorite White House forum, the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention, he dipped into his bag of old tricks and tropes.  First, he nodded in the direction of Alabama Chief Justice Roy Moore by applauding the group's dedication "to the service of God and country. Times change, but those are still the right priorities," said the head of our supposedly secular state.  He tossed another bit of red meat to the crowd, saying, "You are committed, as am I, to protecting the dignity of the flag."  He then gave his sanitized rendition of American history. "In the twentieth century, the American flag and the American uniform stood for something unique in history. This nation gained great power, and we used that power in the service of human freedom."  Tell that to the people of Haiti, Nicaragua, and El Salvador, who were repeatedly beaten back by U.S. invasion, occupation, or proxy rule over the last century.  Tell that to the people of Iran, whose democratically elected government the U.S. overthrew in 1953.  Tell that to the people of Guatemala, whose democratically elected government the U.S. overthrew one year later.  Tell that to the people of Indonesia, whose founder, Sukarno, was overthrown by U.S.-backed forces in 1965, which led to a million deaths.  Tell that to the people of Chile, whose democratically elected government was overthrown thirty years ago.  Tell that to the people of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, when the United States used its power "in the service of human freedom" and ended up killing two to three million.  Bush then put on his Manichaean lenses and said, "No nation can be neutral in the struggle between civilization and chaos." This was a clear echo of "you're either with us, or you're with the terrorists." It is such crudeness that so offends rational people around the world, who loathe terrorism but despise Bush's reckless militarism. Why should they be forced to choose between the two?  Mr. "Bring 'Em On" puffed out his chest again when he bragged that the terrorists thought they'd make America run away. "The terrorists have not seen America running; they've seen America marching. . . . The terrorists have seen speeding tank convoys and roaring jets and special forces arriving in midnight raids. And sometimes justice has found them before they could see anything coming at all."  Note how Bush uses the term "justice" here. As he has repeatedly since September 11, he conflates our traditional system of jurisprudence with assassination.  Bush boasted of the "broad coalition" that has joined the United States in the war on terror. He said "thirty-one countries have contributed 21,000 forces to build security in Iraq," but he didn't mention that most of those forces come from Great Britain, and the rest have barely contributed anything in comparison to the 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq right now. This isn't a coalition effort; it's a U.S. occupation, with a British flank, and a sprinkling of foreign flavors.  With a straight face, Bush said of Saddam, "Because of our military, catastrophic weapons will no longer be in the hands of a reckless, unstable dictator." But where are those catastrophic weapons?  Bush called Iraq "a point of testing in the war on terror."  The problem is, Bush is largely fighting a monster of his own making in Iraq. Prior to the invasion and occupation, Iraq was not a locus of Islamic fundamentalism or a magnet for Al Qaeda.  But it may be now.  Yet that's not all that's going on there. Bush likes to say, as he did again to the Vets, that U.S. forces are facing "Saddam loyalists, the foreign fighters, and the criminal gangs that are attacking Iraqis and coalition forces."  But this conveniently ignores the indigenous nationalism and fundamentalism that Bush's illegal war and botched occupation have given rise to.  Trying pathetically to imitate Winston Churchill, Bush said, "Our only goal, our only option, is total victory in the war on terror, and this nation will press on to victory."  But the way Bush is waging his war on terror is only adding recruits to the other side. By invading and occupying Iraq and throwing open its economy to U.S. companies, the United States is following Osama's script.  Senator Robert Byrd made this point in an op-ed in The Washington Post on August 26. "Our military action in Iraq has forged a cauldron of contempt for America, a dangerous brew that may poison the efforts of peace throughout the Middle East and result in the rapid invigoration of worldwide terrorism," Byrd wrote, adding that Bush's handling of Iraq "virtually guarantees Al Qaeda a fertile field of new recruits."  What's more, as Seymour Hersh pointed out in The New Yorker recently, the Iraq War soured relations with Syria, which up to that point had been very helpful in sharing intelligence with Washington about Al Qaeda operatives.  There may be no such thing as total victory against terrorism, and the costs of trying to obtain it--in dollars, in lives, and in what it would do to our liberties here at home--could be astronomical.  Nor can terrorism be vanquished by George Bush upon a steed, bullying the world as he orders one invasion, occupation, privatization, and assassination after another.  It would help enormously if Bush did not play the part that Osama has assigned him.  -- Matthew Rothschild  http://www.progressive.org/webex03/wx0828b03.html

The success of welfare reform is a faith-based proposition in Washington, D.C. This month, as lawmakers debate the reauthorization of welfare legislation, the conservatives on Capitol Hill will offer their regular sermon on the virtues of 'personal responsibility,' ignoring the steady hemorrhage of jobs from the economy. And since welfare reform was a major legislative focus of President Clinton's 'New Democrats,' the other side of the aisle is unlikely to question the underlying belief that 'ending welfare as we knew it' represented a triumph in social policy.   Out in the real world, however, the jobless recovery and enfeebled social protections are increasingly set on a collision course. Local legislators must confront an ugly truth about their 'reformed' welfare systems: If critics charged that cutting welfare rolls had harmful impacts during the prosperous 1990s, the true extent of the damage is only emerging in the wake of the Bush recession.

Less than half (45%) of the respondents said they rated his job performance good or excellent, while a majority (54%) said it was fair or poor.

      Subject: Latin Religious Leaders Call US-led "Free Trade" FTAA a Neo-Colonialist Trap,      http://www.progress.org/2003/trade13.htm  Religious Leaders Call FTAA a Neo-Colonialist Trap  Favoritism, Special Privileges, and Fake Freedom versus Humanity,  Fairness and True Freedom  During the last two years, the Bush administration broke sharply away  from previous Republican policy, going with protectionist tariffs  against steel, against lumber, against agriculture, and against  catfish.  But the White House, now clearly opposing free trade, still  calls its policy "free trade."  Is that an attempt to trick people,  or just a sign of stupidity?  Either way, no one is impressed.  Here is an article circulated by InterPress Service and OneWorld.net.  Latin Bishops Launch Broadside against So-Called 'Free Trade' Area  by Raul Pierri  The so-called Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) looks less like  a true regional integration project than a ''neo-colonialist'' plan  that will make poor communities even poorer and will not respect  national sovereignty, said the Catholic bishops of the members of  South America's largest trade bloc.  ''What we condemn is that the only aim of the project is to increase  trade flows, regardless of whether it devastates everything and  everyone in its path,'' the secretary-general of the bishops'  conference of Uruguay, Bishop Pablo Galimberti of the southern  Uruguayan city of San Jos, told IPS on September 4, 2003.  The Catholic bishops of the countries of South America's Mercosur  trade bloc -- Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay -- and the  bloc's associate members Bolivia and Chile met this week in  Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital, to discuss the challenges of  integration in Latin America and the ''ethical and moral'' aspects of  the creation of the FTAA.  The initiative promoted by the United States will create a so-called  'free trade' zone made up of 34 countries -- all of the nations in  the Americas with the exception of Cuba -- with a total population of  800 million people and a combined Gross National Product (GNP) of  over $11 [trillion] by 2005.  The main objections to the FTAA raised by the bishops were that it  will benefit the richest countries -- like the United States and  Canada -- at the expense of the less competitive members, and that it  will consolidate the hold of ''unfettered neo-liberalism'' on the  entire region.  ''Christian ethics and the Christian vision encompass everything, not  just the moral aspects,'' said Galimberti.  ''They encompass the  spiritual as well as the economic. We do not separate out religious  and social aspects.''  In a statement, the bishops said the creation of the FTAA would have  ''grave consequences'' due to ''the excessive disproportion of the  competitive capacities of the countries, some of which have very  strong, developed economies while others are weak."  ''This initiative will foment the concentration of economic power in  a few hands, favouring the formation of monopolies and oligopolies,  which will end up imposing their hegemony over governments,  especially in the weakest countries in the Americas.  ''Rather than integration, this could involve neo-colonialism, with a  negative impact on local communities ... The chief aim of an  initiative like the FTAA should be to promote the common good and  solidarity between nations, and not merely to search for the greatest  advantage for just a few ,'' they said.  The bishops also expressed concern over the future of indigenous and  rural communities, ''which in this system would run the risk of being  displaced,'' from land rich in natural resources, for example.  In addition, they said the strategic natural resources of poor  nations ''should not be susceptible to appropriation by private  interests.  '  'A true process of integration in the Americas should be based on a  continent-wide policy that takes into account human rights and the  principles of sovereignty, justice, solidarity and respect for the  cultural identities of nations,'' said the statement.  The secretary-general of Brazil's bishops' conference, Bishop Odilo  Scherer of Sao Paulo, told IPS that the Brazilian Catholic Church is  working with non-governmental organizations on a campaign aimed at  raising awareness about the FTAA, which will include another  ''people's referendum'' in which Brazilians will be asked what they  think about the future so-called 'free trade' area.  ''We will hold an unofficial popular referendum this month to allow  Brazilians to express their opinions about the FTAA. Our big concern  is human beings, who should always take top priority,'' he said.  In a similar referendum held in September 2002, 10 million Brazilians  said they were opposed to the so-called free trade area, according to  the organizers.  The president of Argentina's bishops' conference, Eduardo Mirs,  stressed the negative impact that the prescriptions of the  multilateral lending institutions have had on his crisis-stricken  nation.  ''Our countries need help, without a doubt, but they don't need an  invasion of our sovereignty, which also implies a loss of our  identity. By meddling in our educational programmes, for example,  they are undermining the free determination of nations,'' Mirs, the  archbishop of the eastern Argentine city of Rosario, told IPS.  The bishops meeting in Montevideo did not agree on any concrete  common strategy, nor did they decide to discuss their point of view  with their respective governments.  ''We are making closer contact with political leaders, but we are not  a political party. This statement simply has the objective of helping  to form the faith of Christians, with a social dimension,'' said  Galimberti.  The declaration signed Thursday by the bishops of the Mercosur  nations and their associates Bolivia and Chile concurs with the  pastoral letter Ecclesia in America that Pope John Paul II made  public in Mexico in 1999.  Ecclesia in America stated that ''more and more, in many countries of  the Americas, a system known as 'neo-liberalism' prevails; based on a  purely economic conception of man, this system considers profit and  the law of the market as its only parameters, to the detriment of the  dignity of and the respect due to individuals and peoples.  ''At times this system has become the ideological justification for  certain attitudes and behaviour in the social and political spheres  leading to the neglect of the weaker members of society. Indeed, the  poor are becoming ever more numerous, victims of specific policies  and structures which are often unjust.''  The views of the Roman Catholic Church are of great significance in  the Americas, which is home to 528 million Catholic faithful, nearly  half of the world's 1.1 billion Catholics, according to Vatican  statistics.

      Subject: New Report on Trade and Environment      As the World Trade Organization prepares to debate the relationship between trade and the environment, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has published a new report by GDAE Research Associate Kevin Gallagher on the limitations of the U.S. government?s approach to assessing the environmental impacts of future trade agreements:  "The Environmental Review of the FTAA: Examining the U.S. Approach," Kevin P. Gallagher Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Trade, Equity, and Development Series, No. 7, August 2003. Read More: http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/Pubs/rp/CarnegieKGAug03.htm  Congressional environmental reviews of U.S. trade negotiations fall short of providing timely and useful information to policy makers. With the negotiations of Free Trade Area of the Americas quickly approaching, this paper argues that it is critical for Congress to rectify the methods and processes applied to environmental reviews and ensure they inform trade negotiation in a timely manner, not simply to justify predetermined trade positions.

You can ask us to tolerate modest budget deficits while spending whats needed to meet a major national challenge.   But President Bush cant ask us for $166 billion for Iraq while he runs record $500 billion budget deficits and doubles the national debt -- all in order to give $300 billion a year in tax cuts over the next decade mostly to the best-off people in America.   And Bush certainly cant do this when hes also saying theres no money for huge unmet domestic needs in health care, education and more.   No, this is the moment when President Bushs radical fiscal irresponsibility has veered into radical fiscal immorality.

Bush keeps trying to divert the potential "perfect storm" forming from the combination of the constant stream of bad news coming out of the Middle East and growing domestic discontent over the war and occupation in Iraq.  That storm is likely to gain even more force when the public has a chance to absorb this past week's events, which mostly slid under the media radar as Isabel approached the capital. Particularly striking were signs of growing disarray at the highest levels of the administration, revealed by remarks such as Bush's assertion that there was "no evidence" linking Iraq to the September, 2001, attacks on New York and the Pentagon. This statement directly contradicted both what Vice President Dick Cheney claimed as recently as September 14th and what he and some Pentagon officials had been advocating months before the war. Similarly, the assertion by the U.S. commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, that the popular resistance to the U.S. occupation might be broader than radical Islamists, foreign infiltrators and Baathist "dead-enders" appeared to contradict repeated assurances by top administration officials in recent weeks.  Jim Lobe   is a political analyst for Foreign Policy In Focus (online at www.fpif.org). He also writes regularly for Inter Press Service.

      Trying to hide bad news, povery and income report released Friday  Keep an eye on Friday's release of the Census Bureau's statistics on poverty and household income.  For the past 15 years, the Census Bureau has always released the report on a Tuesday or Thursday. This year, in order to mask the bad news buried within the report, the report will be released on a Friday.  Census spokesman Lawrence Neal says the agency "picked a date out of the air." But the Bush administration has a pattern of announcing controversial or unfavorable news as the weekend begins.    To attract little attention, the strategy makes sense. Friday night's network news broadcasts are the least-watched of the workweek. Saturday newspapers are the week's least-read editions.  Last year's report was pretty heinous, and if the release date is any indication, this year's promises to be even worse.  Last year's reports showed that median household income in 2001 registered the first significant decline since 1991 and the percentage of Americans living in poverty rose from 11.3% to 11.7%, the first increase in five years.  http://www.dailykos.com/archives/004262.html#004262

It was never intuitive. And the reason was simple. Like every other white person, I had never experienced it myself: the meaning of color was something I had to learn. The turning point was falling in love with my wife, an Indian-Malaysian, and her coming to live in England. Then, over time, I came to see my own country in a completely different way, through her eyes, her background. Color is something white people never have to think about because for them it is never a handicap, never a source of prejudice or discrimination, but rather the opposite, a source of privilege. However liberal and enlightened I tried to be, I still had a white outlook on the world. My wife was the beginning of my education."

It is the principalities of darkness. It is a demonic presence in that city that God revealed to me as the enemy."  Of Osama bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and North Korea's Kim Jung il: "Why do they hate us? The answer to that is because we're a Christian nation. We are hated because we are a nation of believers."  Of the president: "George Bush was not elected by a majority of the voters in the United States, he was appointed by God."  (All quotes taken from addresses made to evangelical congregations, all guaranteed genuine thanks to military analyst William Arkin of the Los Angeles Times, The Pentagon Unleashes a Holy Warrior.)  Now, the above quotes and others caused national news consternation. The day the story broke in the press, it was also at or close to the top of the various network prime-time news shows, though largely in a round-up-the-usual-suspects kind of way. The President was generally shown not to be of General Boykin's type. Yes, he had slipped early on. That darn "crusades" reference (which Eisenhower got away with in a famous book title -- Crusade in Europe -- back in the days when nobody here knew there were Muslims in the world). But generally, as we all know, the President has "reached out" to the Islamic world (as has his attorney general to Islamic immigrants with somewhat analogous results domestically and globally).  But let's stop and consider General Boykin's comments a bit more closely. If, as he claims, the younger Bush was appointed by God -- who, I wonder, appointed the elder Bush? -- and the younger Bush, in turn, appointed Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense, and Rumsfeld appointed Boykin to help hunt down the Satanic Triad, then it seems clear enough, from one point of view anyway, that Boykin (the poor sap had to offer public apologies yesterday) was himself deputized by and a deputy to God with a cap G.

      Bush Sr.'s 'message' to Bush Jr.  By Georgie Anne Geyer, 10/18/2003  WASHINGTON -- IT'S NOT AS THOUGH Osama bin Laden gave a Jihad Award to Ariel Sharon, or Donald Rumsfeld gave his Good Pal Award to Condoleezza Rice. It's not even as though Dick Cheney gave his Favorite Foreigners Citation to the French.  But the news from College Station, Texas, this week -- that the First Father, former President George H.W. Bush, has given his own most treasured award to Senator Edward Kennedy -- is nearly as astonishing.  When it was announced (with amazingly little fanfare) that the pugnaciously anti-Iraq war Democrat Kennedy had been awarded the 2003 George Bush Award for Excellence in Public Service, so many jaws dropped all over Washington that usually voluble politicians were only heard swallowing their real thoughts.  Since the current President Bush veered away from the real war against terrorism in Afghanistan and went a'venturing in Iraq, much to his father's dismay, just about everybody close to Washington politics has known of the policy schism between father and son.  It was politically and philosophically obvious. But people around Father Bush, a coterie of traditional internationalist conservatives who protect him like a wolf mother does her cubs, would heatedly deny any family rift -- and nobody spoke publicly about it.  Now it's all out. Father Bush has done it in his own preferred nuanced way -- the way Establishment gentlemen operate -- but he has revealed the depth of his disagreement with his impetuously uninformed son.  And won't it be interesting to analyze the speeches citing Teddy, who is surely one of W's primary political nemeses, for his public service and principles at the Bush Library Center on the Texas A&M campus on Nov. 7? One can bet they will be subtle -- but also very clear.  The ideological rift between father and son has been growing ever since George W. began focusing on Iraq and, with that obsession, proposed "theories" of unilateralism (America needs room in the world) and preemption (kill even your perceived enemy before he kills you).  But while family friends say Father Bush has made his disagreements known to his son, they clearly have not found fertile soil in this White House.  More curious, and in many ways depressing, is the fact that this President Bush has embarked upon a policy designed to counter, or even to wipe out, his father's entire political legacy.  The father lived his life in the service of moderate and intelligent internationalism. His manners were always meticulously courteous, as he wooed even critics overseas to see the American position. He was even-handed in the Middle East and thus brought the area to the verge of peace for the first time in history; he was capable of using force but preferred to do it supported by coalitions of friendly states, thus cementing international cooperation.  The son seems to have made posturing against his father's accomplishments and beliefs his life's work.  W has given way to a radical right that abhors international coalitions and manners; he mocks the world and denies any need for its help. He has led the Middle East to the nadir of its hope and possibilities, and he has led the United States to a moment in history in which we face asymmetric warfare from one end of the globe to another.  And above all, he has replaced his father's courtesy and good graces with an almost proud rudeness and scorn for others.  Why? I'll leave the question of "killing the father" to the psychiatric thinkers. Meanwhile, the tension between these two men reveals itself daily.  November 7 will give us a chance to see how this tension, which is crucial to the public and political lives of all Americans, plays out. In the Bush Library announcement of the award to Teddy Kennedy, the spokesman praised the liberal senator as a man who "consistently and courageously fought for his principles," and as an "inspiration to all Americans."  You know what I wish (besides being able to read the president's mind)? I wish Father Bush would drop his polite reticence and tell us what he and the team of his presidency really think about what is happening in America today. I think, as responsible citizens, we deserve that.  Georgie Anne Geyer is a syndicated columnist.   Copyright 2003 Globe Newspaper Company.

The rule, known as Order 39, allows foreign investors to own Iraqi companies fully with no requirements for reinvesting profits back into the country, something that had previously been restricted by the Iraqi constitution to citizens of Arab countries.While potential investors have applauded the new rules for helping rebuild the Iraqi economy, legal scholars are concerned that the United States may be violating longstanding international laws governing military occupation."

But DISAPPROVAL is actually a pretty good negative indicator-- a lot of time approval ratings go up and down as swing voters move from apathetic "don't know" to approval, but active disapproval shows a hard core of voters likely unavailable to an incumbent President.  And remarkablely Bush has generated a larger core of disapproval than either his Dad or Carter in 1980 at this points in their terms.   Folks sometimes wonder why I remain so hopeful on Bush's defeat-- maybe these numbers will expand the optimistic posse.

The investigation, which is continuing, could lead to indictments, a Justice Department official said.    According to these sources, John Hannah and Cheney's chief of staff, Lewis 'Scooter' Libby, were the two Cheney employees.

      Civil Rights Act of 2004   I criticize the Supreme Court for its constitutional decisions, but the rightwing on the court does great damage just by making narrow interpretations of statutory law which frustrates the civil rights and worker protections that the drafters of the law meant to defend.  So legislators, backed by a range of civil rights and labor groups, have introduced FAIRNESS: The Civil Rights Act of 2004 to overturn a number of those bad Supreme Court decisions:  Among other remedies, the FAIRNESS Act guarantees equal access to publicly funded services, protection for older workers and workers returning from military service, viable remedies for on-the-job discrimination, and equal pay for women in the workforce. Recently published fact sheets by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Education Fund assess the recent Court rulings mentioned in the legislation.  There is a good online fact sheet on why this new law is needed:  In Alexander v. Sandoval, the Supreme Court held that Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not permit individuals to sue to stop an apparently neutral practice that has the effect of discriminating; individuals may sue only if thy can prove the discrimination is "intentional."...Civil rights plaintiffs now must rely upon the federal government to bring virtually all of their cases, rather than being able to sue on their own - an inadequate alternative since federal agencies often are overburdened and unable to ensure individualized relief.   [and]  State employees have lost their rights to sue for money damages violations of the [federal minimum wage law], such as the denial of overtime pay. This was the Supreme Court's ruling in Alden v. Maine. The Alden ruling leaves state employees without adequate protection against employer abuses of federal labor laws.   [and]  In Buckhannon Board & Care Home v. West Virginia Dept. of Health and Human Resources, the Supreme Court held that if a losing defendant "voluntarily" changes its conduct as a result of the plaintiff's lawsuit, the plaintiff does not have the right to recover attorneys' fees from the defendanteven if the lawsuit was the catalyst for the defendant's change in conduct.    Immigrant workers have lost their rights to damages or back pay even when they prove that the employer violated federal labor law. In Hoffman Plastic Compounds, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Board, the Supreme Court held that undocumented immigrants are ineligible to receive back pay for violations of the National Labor Relations Act.  There's more, but through a drip, drip of bad decisions, the practical ability of plaintiffs to get relief for violation of civil and labor rights violations had been dramatically eroded in recent years.   This legislation is critical to restore those lost rights

      More on the Issue of women under US Occupation...  RULE OF THE RAPISTS Britain and the US said war on Afghanistan would liberate women. We are still waiting Mariam Rawi in Kabul The Guardian, February 12, 2004   When the US began bombing Afghanistan on October 7 2001, the oppression of Afghan women was used as a justification for overthrowing the Taliban regime. Five weeks later America's first lady, Laura Bush, stated triumphantly: "Because of our recent military gains in much of Afghanistan, women are no longer imprisoned in their homes. The fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of women."  However, Amnesty International paints a rather different picture: "Two years after the ending of the Taliban regime, the international community and the Afghan transitional administration, led by President Hamid Karzai, have proved unable to protect women. The risk of rape and sexual violence by members of armed factions and former combatants is still high. Forced marriage, particularly of girl children, and violence against women in the family are widespread in many areas of the country."  [Mariam Rawi, a member of the Revolutionary Association of Women of Afghanistan, is writing under a pseudonym www.rawa.org]

      Kahn Job: Bush Spiked Probe of Pakistan?s Dr. Strangelove, BBC reported in 2001   On November 7, 2001, BBC TV and the Guardian of London reported that the Bush Administration thwarted investigations of Dr. A.Q. Kahn who this week confessed selling atomic secrets to Libya, North Korea, and Iran.  The Bush Administration has expressed shock at the disclosures that Pakistan, our ally in the war on terror, has been running a nuclear secrets bazaar.  In fact, according to the British News Team sources', Bush did not know of these facts because, shortly after his inauguration, his National Security Agency defectively stymied the probe of Kahn Research Laboratories.  CIA and other agents could not investigate the spread of Islamic Bombs through Pakistan because funding appeared to originate in Saudi Arabia.  Greg Palast and David Pallister received a California State University Project Censored Award for this expose based on the story broadcast by Palast on BBC Television Newsnight.     According to both sources and documents obtained by the BBC, the Bush Administration Spike of the investigation of Dr. Kahn's Lab followed from a wider policy of protecting key Saudi Arabians including the Bin Laden Family.  Noam Chomsky, who read the story on page one of the Times of India, has wondered, "Why wasn't this all over US papers?"    To learn why, read the following excerpt from the 2003 edition of Palast's book, The Best Democracy Money Can Buy @

Further, we estimate that roughly one in four women and one in seven men who had full-time jobs the year round earned less than the poverty level for a family of four."

She said today: "The White House is already trying to backpedal from the annual Economic Report of the President which predicted 2.6 million jobs added for this year. We know that it will add far less; moreover, many of the new jobs will not be paying a living wage. Developments in technology and corporate globalization have greatly reduced the leverage of workers everywhere to obtain decent wages and working conditions -- until that changes, we are likely to continue to see divergent results: productivity is up but wages are lagging, profits are up but jobs are lackluster, stock market is up, so is the number of people without health insurance. Locally adjusted global minimum wage and universal corporate codes of conduct could be a first step."

      HEATHER BOUSHEY, hboushey@cepr.net, http://www.cepr.net An economist with the Center for Economic and Policy Research, Boushey said today: "Compare the current job-loss recovery to the job-less recovery of the early 1990s, and you'll find that in the first 25 months of the recovery of the early 1990s, the economy gained 1,681,000 jobs. Now, 25 months since the 2001 recession ended, the economy has lost 776,000 jobs and wages are actually falling, in spite of booming productivity growth.... This week, the administration has acknowledged that their policies over the past three years have not met their own projections for job growth [which] had assumed that the economy would add about 300,000 jobs per month. Although economic growth picked up last year, as did productivity, 2003 ended with fewer jobs than it had when it began, and over the past four months we've added an average of only 75,000 jobs per month. President Bush said that he would provide more funds for job training.... However, over the past three years, he has proposed at least $1 billion in cuts to job training and vocational programs."

      DOUG HENWOOD, dhenwood@panix.com, http://www.leftbusinessobserver.com Author of "After the New Economy," Henwood said today: "It seems the default explanation for the weak state of the job market more than two years after the official end of the recession is outsourcing. Or, in the crude form, foreigners are stealing our jobs. Reality is a lot more complicated than that. In manufacturing, most countries -- including, to almost everyone's surprise, China -- are losing jobs. And in services, jobs lost to outsourcing would be made up by two or three months of normal job growth. But we're not getting normal job growth, and the reasons for that are mostly of domestic origin -- mainly the lingering hangover from the late-1990s bubble. But few people want to talk about that -- or the almost nonexistent public support given to unemployed workers. Instead of the sterile back and forth between 'free traders' and 'protectionists,' let's recast the debate: protect the worker, not the job."

      Bremer left Brass out of Loop on Iraqi Army Dissolution  AFP reports that  Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Peter Pace says that the Joint Chiefs were never consulted by Paul Bremer over his decision to simply dissolve the Iraqi army last May.  Since actually having an Iraqi army might have made it easier to control the security situation, and since hundreds of US soldiers have been killed and thousands wounded as a result of poor security, you would have thought that the uniformed military deserved a voice in that epochal decision.  This sort of high-handedness has characterized the civilians in the Department of Defense ever since Bush got elected.  Gen. Shinseki said you'd need hundreds of thousands of troops in Iraq for some time to keep order.   http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/consequences/2003/0228pentagoncontra.htm   He got slapped down by Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz, those great military minds and masters of anti-insurgency.  Neither has ever offered Shinseki an apology or admission that he was right and they were wrong.  The Neocons have been ordering around the generals, and the generals have had no choice but to do as they are told.  Their premise is that the American public is populated by fools who can easily be swayed with a few rousing calls to patriotism.  One only hopes that the next election proves them wrong.  Why did Bremer dissolve the Iraqi army?  It is not true that it had stopped existing.  The men would have reported to their barracks if instructed to do so and paid.  Rumor has it that Ahmad Chalabi insisted on getting rid of the Baath army, because he wanted to build his own private militia and take over Iraq.  But then, there are also rumors that Bremer did not like Chalabi, and did not agree with the Cheney/Garner plan, which had been to hand Iraq over to Chalabi within 6 months.  One day we will know.  But we won't get back the men and women killed and maimed in Iraq.

      http://www.americanprogress.org/   As tax day approaches and American families prepare to pay their fair share, more and more big corporations are hiding their assets in corporate tax shelters and offshore havens, forcing average taxpayers to make up the difference.  http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/tax/etc/synopsis.html  PBS's Frontline reports, the General Accounting Office "estimates that illegitimate tax shelters cost the government more than $85 billion in recent years." Corporations are taxed at 35%, but with the help of shelters, large corporations pay less than half of that.  http://www.progressivetrail.org/articles/031209Drutman.shtml  And that means the average American is left holding the bag, paying about 15% more than they should. Last year, for example, "corporate tax revenues fell to only 7.4% of federal tax receipts, the second lowest level on record. (In the 1940s, corporations contributed almost half of federal taxes.)"

      http://www.americanprogress.org/  The Class Warrior  After supporting tax cuts for the wealthy which have already blown a gaping hole in the federal budget, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told lawmakers that Congress should extend the cuts indefinitely  at a cost of $1.5 trillion over the next ten years  and pay for it by slashing Social Security.  http://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/26/business/26FED.html?pagewanted=print&position=  Greenspan's comments were particularly surprising because our current budget problems are completely unrelated to Social Security. A recent Center on Budget and Policy Priorities study reveals that, in the last three years, the nation's long-term budget projection has gone from a $5 trillion surplus to a $4.3 trillion deficit and tax cuts were the single largest factor behind that decline.  http://www.cbpp.org/1-28-04bud.htm  The large role of tax cuts in the deficit has been confirmed by the President's own budget analysis. Social Security, meanwhile, continues to run a surplus. Greenspan's recommendation amounts to a huge transfer of wealth from future retirees to the very rich. http://www.govexec.com/dailyfed/0203/021203bb.htm   The President, for his part, dodged a direct question yesterday about whether he believes, as Greenspan does, we should scale back Social Security to deal with the rising budget deficit, saying he needed to "see exactly what [Greenspan] said." http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/02/20040225-1.html

      In a press statement today, the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, Americans Uniteds executive director,decried the notion that the Massachusetts high courts ruling was out of line and opposed any scheme to alter the U.S. Constitution.  Im not worried about gay marriage, Lynn said. I am, however, very worried about the marriage between President Bush and Religious Right zealots. Our Constitution has never been amended to take away minority rights, and we should not be taking such an action now.  The reaction to the Massachusetts ruling has been shrill and over-the-top. There is nothing radical about preserving individual liberty and demanding equal protection for all, Lynn continued. Nor is it extreme to uphold the separation of church and state, which is also what that decision did.

      Dear Friends:  Please read the second articlebelow for some good news around immigration processing (more immigration processing staff coming to Memphis and Nashville!).  If you areconcerned about theissue of immigration backlogs, please attend the press conference today at noon! This event will be held at the Somali Community Center, on 201 Thompson lane, Suite 202 in Nashville.Thank you!  - David Lubell  TIRRC      http://tennessean.com/local/archives/04/02/47583283.shtml?Element_ID=47583283    By ANITA WADHWANI Staff Writer  On today's one-year anniversary of the creation of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, immigrant groups in Nashville and across the country are asking that the agency's ''major flaws'' be corrected.  The mammoth department created last year, with 180,000 on its payroll, absorbed the former Immigration and Naturalization Service along with new post-Sept. 11, 2001, national security operations.  ''The complaints we've heard about immigration processing have only gone up since the creation of USCIS,'' said David Lubell of the Tennessee Immigrant and Refuge Rights Coalition. Lubell was referring to the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service, the arm of Homeland Security that is devoted to immigrants seeking benefits such as citizenship or legal permanent residence.  Lubell said the USCIS had inherited many of its problems from the former INS and has made them worse. The problems include longer waits for processing citizenship requests and plans to increase fees for services, Lubell said.  Related story.  Not everyone is upset over the changes, however.  The backlog in applications are ''good indicators right here that we're taking in more legal immigrants than we can possibly keep up with,'' said Donna Locke of Tennesseans for Immigration Control and Reform.  The number of applications waiting for approval by the USCIS have jumped about 60% in the past year, according to a report by the General Accounting Office released last month.  There were 6.2 million applications for people wanting to become citizens, permanent residents, or seeking some other immigration status by the end of September, compared with 3.9 million two years earlier, according to the report.  In addition, the agency has proposed increasing application fees for immigration paperwork by about $55 per application.  Immigrant advocates in at least nine other cities are planning events to highlight the Department of Homeland Security anniversary, Lubell said.  Anita Wadhwani covers race and demographics for The Tennessean. Contact her at awadhwani@tennessean.com or 259-8821.    http://www.tennessean.com/local/archives/04/02/47583284.shtml?ELEMENT_47583284  Nashville will soon have its first federal workers devoted to helping immigrants become citizens, according to staff in U.S. Rep. Jim Cooper's office.  At least four new ''citizenship interviewers'' will begin working out of Nashville, said Greg Hinote, Cooper's chief of staff. At least four others will beef up the staff in the Memphis office, the only existing immigration service office in the state.  The effort to establish a federal immigration office in Nashville has been going on for more than a decade, according to congressional staff members and immigration lawyers.  The Nashville area is home to more immigrants than any other part of the state. Currently immigrants living in Nashville  or anywhere else in the state  drive to Memphis to do business with the U.S. Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services.  The Memphis service is understaffed and overwhelmed by the number of people it has to work with every day, immigrant advocates say.  Cooper, along with Sens. Lamar Alexander and Bill Frist, have met with USCIS officials for several months to negotiate for the new personnel, Hinote said.   Anita Wadhwani

It was the most extraordinary and least heralded upheaval of the Age of Revolutions: rebel slaves defeated first the French, then the British, then a new attempt to re-enslave them by Napoleon. But in their ordeal lies some of the seeds of the country's problems today."

Meanwhile, the programs created over the course of the 20th century to shield people from labor market instabilities are being whittled away. The Republican majority in the Congress stalls on the extension of long-term unemployment insurance, the president proposes to make welfare (which has always been the unemployment insurance program for less regular workers) harder to get, and harder to keep, and housing subsidies and even earned income tax credits are slashed. This is not a compassionate conservative regime; it is a hard right regime."

This current account (mostly trade) deficit has gotten very little attention as compared to the federal budget deficit, although it is at least as important. Some implications: (1) developing countries that are offering costly concessions (in such proposed agreements as the FTAA or CAFTA) in exchange for access to the U.S. market will find this market unavailable for them as the dollar falls and our trade gap narrows over the coming decade; (2) the Federal Reserve may raise interest rates even in a weak economy, in order to counteract the inflation that results from the dollar's inevitable decline."

      I received this from someone concerned about our inclusion of pro palestinian position at the peace rally.  I include their email and my response.  What do you think?  Do you think I am off base?  Would you have stated it differently?  (looking forward to our rally Sat.  Remember poster making tonight 7:00 at the center.  We have received a lot of interest from people all over the county ( not just you usual protest goers)  For example the Germantown Democratic Club.  Deb Gibson has been great at reaching out to new groups.  Good Job Deb.  )  Email from Concerned Citizen....  I would be glad to discuss the merits of your position with you at any time. I would point out that the Jewish side to this issue has accepted a 2 state solution sice the Pell Report in the 1930's. That solution has been available to the Arabs side for about 70 years. As a life-long liberal, I have been dismayed at the romance of members of the Left with the Palestinians. The speakers listed on your program certainly would seem to represent only one side's viewpoint. But that is not the issue here.      My concern is the mixing of this with an anti-Iraq war rally. Why mix the two? They are two very separate issues at their core. There are plenty of anti-Bush, pro-Israel people out there. Heck, I am an ardent supportor of Israel and I think Bush's policies in the Arab-Israeli conflict (and just about everything else) have been a disaster from day one. But you sure have me upset aboout this rally. And by giving voice to the idea, expressed by many on the Palestinian side, that somehow the supposed aggression of the Israelis gives some credence to the actions of Hamas or Hezbollah or OBL & his crew, you partially legitimize or rationalize horrific acts and a strategy that has only brought misery & poverty to the Palestinian Arabs. Can't anybody read Gandhi over there?   My Response:  I think this is an excellent topic for discussion.   (maybe we can arrange for it in the near future.  the ignorance in the US about the range of views within the Israeli peace movement and the general population in Israel is a major obstacle to overcome-  for both those within the US peace movement and within the jewish community in America)  I really understand your anger on this issue.  The collection of activists that make of the Midsouth peace and justice center are(*see below)  utterly opposed to those within the peace movement (like ANSWER) that we feel are not sufficiently anti Palestinian violence and totally Anti the state of Israel.  They mistakenly embrace anything that is anti US empire as their friend. There is no one locally that reflects this reactionary wing of the peace movement.  *I can't use the singular verb because we are truly quite diverse.  But this is why it is important to raise and not ignore the problem of Israel.  we are proposing a radically new foreign policy that places all countries and sub populations on equal footing.  Our country is proposing a world empire with foreign countries serving US interests by suppressing human freedom of their own people.  This has to be opposed in no uncertain terms.  To remain silent is to allow the carnage and oppression to continue and expand.  We stand with the Israeli (and palestinian) peace movements.  We stand with the people that want what all humans want.  We stand against governments that act against the interests of their own people.  We are PRO Israeli and Pro Palestinians as well as pro american.  We refuse to remain silent when political leaders act in ways that harm the interests of their people.  The rally is about a single vision of human equality, freedom and empowerment.  All people whether male, female, gay or straight, jew or Muslim, iraqi or american deserve the same existence.  Our Government is set on dividing us into subgroups and pitting us against each other.  We say the Empire building has both domestic and international ramifications.  So we are equally against the patriot act as well as US support for Israeli settlements on Palestinian land.  We see the Iraqi war as a single act in web of relations that seeks to place the US in control over the world's economic resources.  To ignore the US role in supporting oppression in the middle east (iraq, saudi Arabia, and Israel) is to ignore an important tool for the Creation of the American Empire.  Ghandi would not make distinctions between governments.  All governments must be held to the same standards of justice and peace.   To remain silent in the face of human pain is not an option.  allan  Please let me know if you are interested in helping creating a forum on the range of views around peace within Isreal.

      A Reflection following the poor person prayer from Tikkun Olam (Repairing the World) Midrash on the Haggadah  By Rabbi David Seidenberg   "How do we raise our own voices? By protesting poverty and injustice. How do we do teshuvah? By responding to the voices that call out to us, by changing how we live. Only when we answer each other's needs do our own prayers become precious. Only then does our bread become "lechem oni/the bread of answering."   My reaction... What I really like about this time of of the jewish year is the Seder dinner.  Its focus on justice and liberation is empowering.    The needs of the poor are questions to be answered by us.  We can do Teshuvah  or repentance by changing our local ordances to allow more of our community members to join the ranks of living sustaninable wages.  It is a first step in creating a memphis where all people who work receive a living wage.   allan

That is a particularly inappropriate claim to make, leaving aside the obvious leaping of the church/state wall. Given that Bush has chosen to wage war in an Islamic country, it is unlikely that there are many Iraqis who are anxious to hear Bush's theological justifications.         Bush's rhetoric is proof once again that the government of the United States is in the hands of a crude and deluded leader, whose war policy in Iraq promises more disasters to come.      "Our work may become more difficult before it is finished," he said. With Bush's approach, that is a guarantee

He said today: "Many of the most important issues facing us -- climate change, international debt, nuclear proliferation, war, the balance of trade between nations -- can be resolved only at the global or the international level.... Our task is not to overthrow globalization, but to capture it, and to use it as a vehicle for humanity's first global democratic revolution.     "There is already a global governance system in place, dominated by the rich and the powerful. We need a new kind of global governance based on global democratic principles and moral authority. I propose establishing new institutions and making sweeping reforms in salvageable existing institutions.     "Simply scrapping existing institutions would not be enough. The near collapse of the reviled World Trade Organization has not prevented injustice as the European Union and the U.S. have discovered that they are in fact better off without the WTO -- they have now struck bilateral deals with most of the weaker nations, which are even more oppressive."  * "In principle, the United Nations is a good idea but in practice, it helps the strong to bully the weak, for three reasons: The permanent members of the Security Council have been granted absolute power; tiny nations have the same vote as the very large ones; dictatorships have the same voting rights as the democracies, and none of the attendant governments have any obligation to refer to their people before voting. The first steps in democratizing the UN could involve scrapping the Security Council and vesting its powers in the UN General Assembly, weighting the votes of the member states according to their country's size and their degree of democratization."  * "While the UN is, in theory, reformable, the IMF and the World Bank are not.... When they were established in 1944, a much better idea had already been proposed by John Maynard Keynes: an International Clearing Union, a bank operating at the international level, in which nations held their trade accounts. They would be charged interest not only on their trade deficits, but also on their trade surpluses and therefore have a powerful incentive to 'clear' their accounts -- in other words, to end up with neither a deficit nor a surplus...."  * "We also need some kind of a global trading body, if the weaker nations are to have any possibility of collective bargaining. The nations which are poor today would be permitted to follow the routes to development taken by the nations which are rich today: protecting their new industries from foreign competition until they are big enough to stand on their own feet, and making free use of other countries' intellectual property, for trade within their own borders and with other poor nations. It is unfortunate that many progressives from rich nations, such as presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich, portray attempts to curb back subsidies in rich nations, such as the recent WTO ruling against agribusiness cotton subsidies in the U.S., as a negative development. Such subsidies enrich large corporations while devastating millions of poor farmers around the world."

       urlLink Western States Legal Foundation home   JACQUELINE CABASSO, wslf@earthlink.net, http://www.wslfweb.org Executive director of the Western States Legal Foundation, Cabasso has written widely on nuclear weapons. She said today: "President Bush waged war on the pretext of disarming Iraq, whose nuclear weapons program in fact had been dismantled by 1995. Now at the United Nations, where governments are meeting about the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), the United States is claiming that 'the NPT does not prohibit the nuclear weapons states from modernizing their nuclear forces while they possess nuclear weapons.... It would be a novel interpretation of the NPT to assert that conceptual work on a "Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator" or other new weapons designs is problematic under the NPT.' But the treaty requires 'negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date.' More than 30 years after the NPT became law, and 15 years after the Berlin Wall came down, the U.S. position exemplifies bad faith, and is seen that way by most of the world. This does not bode well for the viability of the nonproliferation regime."

       urlLink PIPA - What's New   You have heard the news now read the report...the key finding is that if this perception could change, the presidency will fall...   STEVEN KULL, skull@pipa.org, http://www.pipa.org Kull is director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes which has recently released two studies: "U.S. Public Beliefs on Iraq and the Presidential Election" and "Americans on WMD Proliferation." He said today: "Sixty percent of Americans believe that just before the war Iraq either had weapons of mass destruction or a major program for developing them. Few Americans perceive most experts as saying the contrary. Perceptions of what the experts are saying are highly correlated with intentions to vote for the president in the upcoming election. Among those who perceived experts as saying that Iraq had WMDs, 72 percent said they would vote for Bush. Despite polling showing that the majority of world public opinion is opposed to the U.S. war with Iraq, only 41 percent were aware that this is the case. Among those who knew that world public opinion opposed the U.S. going to war with Iraq, only 25 percent thought that going to war was the right decision.... Asked how many nuclear weapons the U.S. has, the median estimate was 200 ... the actual number of U.S. nuclear warheads is 6,000. A majority is not aware that the U.S. made a commitment to seek the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons as part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. However [when informed] a very large majority (84 percent) thinks doing so was a good idea and that the U.S. should make greater efforts toward that goal. A very large majority supports giving international inspectors the power to examine biological research labs in all countries, including the U.S., to determine if they are abiding by the biological weapons treaty. Three-quarters incorrectly believe that the U.S. government supports such an inspection regime. Americans show a strong preference for multilateral arms control over the use of military threats."

Ellsberg said today: "In the special court-martial of Sgt. Mejia in Georgia on Wednesday, the wrong man is on trial. If Monday's revelations by Seymour Hersh are confirmed, on the personal responsibility of Donald Rumsfeld and President George W. Bush for treatment of prisoners amounting to torture, they should both resign or be impeached and tried by the International Criminal Court in The Hague for war crimes. Sgt. Mejia served his country bravely and well in Iraq; but he is serving his country better, and just as bravely, in his publicly-announced refusal to participate further in what he correctly identifies as an illegal war using illegal means. That is also true of his role in being one of the first to expose serious American violations of the Geneva Conventions on treatment of prisoners, which as ratified treaties have the status, with the Constitution, of the highest law of the land. Mejia's commendation ... cites his 'courage and commitment' ... Those words apply exactly to his present stance..."

      	TFTC Stop CAFTA Update 	By glencanyon@comcast.net  -  In this message:  1.  Press Release calling on Congress to vote NO on CAFTA   **************************** FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  May 28, 2004 Contact: Lesley Ramsey, (512) 507-4185  Coalition calls on Texas Congressional delegation to vote NO on CAFTA  (AUSTIN) Today, as President Bush signs the Central American Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) in Washington D.C., a statewide coalition of fair trade advocates in Texas is calling on members of Congress to commit now to voting NO on the agreement.  CAFTA is a regional agreement between the U.S. and five Central American countries: Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, the negotiations for the terms of which concluded in December 2003. The Dominican Republic was also "docked" onto the agreement.  First and foremost, we see CAFTA as a referendum on NAFTA, said Lesley Ramsey, director of the Texas Fair Trade Coalition. After 10 years of NAFTA, we know firsthand the devastating effects of this policy on working people everywhere. We will NOT support its expansion.  Second, CAFTA fails to meet any of the baseline requirements for a FAIR trade agreement:        It does NOT include adequate enforcement for violations of internationally recognized labor and environmental standards;        It allows foreign corporations to bring actions against governments that pass labor, public health or environmental laws that reduce corporate profits, as they are allowed to do under NAFTA Chapter 11; and        It includes rules that promote privatization and deregulation of services including education, health care, postal service, construction, transportation and water supply.  Finally, CAFTA is a crucial step toward the even more dangerous Free Trade Area of the Americas--which the Bush administration hopes to finish negotiating this year.  Based on the NAFTA model, CAFTA would push ahead the corporate globalization agenda that has caused a "race to the bottom" in labor and environmental standards in the U.S. and Central America. CAFTA would also include services provisions promoting the privatization and deregulation of fundamental public services.    In addition, CAFTA would remove all tariff barriers in the five Central American countries on imported agricultural products. This would allow cheaply grown and heavily subsidized U.S. corn and other basic grains to flood local markets (subsidies that almost exclusively benefit giant agribusiness in the U.S.). Small farmers in Central America, already devastated by the importation of cheaply grown agribusiness U.S. grains, years of drought, and the massive fall of coffee prices on the world market, would face the extinction of their livelihoods. CAFTA would likely force a massive migration of erstwhile farmers to large urban areas to work in the informal sector or maquilas (sweatshops), or to risk a dangerous journey to seek work in the U.S.  The Administration's push to implement CAFTA is part of a strategy for an expanded and equally flawed trade agreement, the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) which would cover all of North, Central, and South America except Cuba.   The Texas Fair Trade Coalition is a statewide coalition of labor, environmental organizations, family farmers, religious groups and other social justice organizations working together for economic fairness in trade policy.

The axis was originally between weapons of mass destruction and terrorism, with all the emphasis on Saddam. Rice and her deputy, Steve Hadley, "were aware of the secret planning on Iraq, and they worried that singling out Iraq as the embodiment of the 'axis of evil' connection between WMD and terrorism would appear a declaration of war. . . . So she and Hadley suggested adding other countries. North Korea and Iran were the clear candidates."

      While Republicans seeking the 65-million-strong Catholic vote want bishops to consider only abortion, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., provides a more balanced view of Catholic senators' attitudes toward Catholic teaching with his ranking of Senate votes on pro-life, domestic policy and foreign policy issues. Using the stated legislative priorities of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB), Durbin ranked the 24 senators on Catholic positions in 48 votes, from the minimum wage to the right to unionize on the domestic front to the Iraq war resolution and Global AIDS funding on the international side as well as pro-life issues. Nathan Newman, at nathannewman.com, noted that, unsurprisingly, Democratic senators do poorly on pro-life ratings, except for the death penalty, but some Catholic Republicans are way off on other legislative priorities. John Sununu, R-N.H., and Rick Santorum, R-Pa., received the lowest domestic ratings (23%) with Jim Bunning, R-Ky., and Santorum tied with the lowest ratings in foreign policy (6%). Other Catholic GOPers with notably low ratings were Pete Domenici, N.M. (27% Domestic, 12% International) and Lisa Murkowski, Alaska (33% Domestic, 7% International). John Kerry had the highest domestic rating of any Catholic senator (95%) and had the highest overall ranking of 60.9%, followed by Durbin (60.5%) and Kennedy (60.4). "Unfortunately, recent media attention has focused on one or two priorities of the Catholic Church, while obscuring others. This has made it more difficult for Catholic voters to understand the full range of issues that have been identified by the USCCB as priorities for public life," said Durbin. "What we have done today is to use the criteria established by the US Catholic Bishops to give voters an insight into the voting records of Catholic senators."  Steven Thomma of Knight Ridder Newspapers noted that US Catholic registered voters prefer Bush over Kerry by 48% to 41%, according to a national survey by Quinnipiac University in Connecticut. In Ohio, a key battleground, Catholics prefer Bush over Kerry by 42.5% to 41.4%, according to a recent survey by Mason-Dixon. By comparison, Protestants prefer Bush by nearly 2-1, while Jews and voters of other religions prefer Kerry by 2-1.  Ruy Teixera, examining the 2004 National Survey on Religion and Politics in his June 2 Public Opinion Watch at www.tcf.org, found that evangelical Christians are not as solidly Republican as conventional wisdom has it. In at least one group, the "modernist" evangelicals, about one-sixth of the total, supported Kerry over Bush by 9 points (46% to 37%). And while "traditional" Catholics support Bush 60-30, they are only 27% of the total. Of the rest, centrists support Kerry 45-51 and modernists by a lopsided 61-33. And the polling data suggest strongly that those Catholics are far more concerned about issues, such as the economy, education and health care than abortion and gay marriage.

      July 4th is coming.  Patriotism comes to mind, but who are the patriots that you see?  For many patriots are limited to those who choose violent professions like the military.  But what about non-violent patriots?  Who are your non-violent heroes?  I have one that comes to mind:  Myles Horton of Highlander Center in East TN.  He began his life as a labor and community activist, creating the Highlander center as a place where activists from all over the country could come together and teach each other about creating social change.  The Highlander center changed over the years, shifting to civil rights in the late forties (as the left activists were kicked out of organized labor) through the sixties. Then taking on issues of environmental justice,  community reinvestment as well as anti racist mobilization.  What remains is a commitment to cooperative egalitarian knowledge transfer with the goal of social change.    What are your non-violent patriots?

It's not a gift that somebody says, 'Hey, now it's time for you to get married. It's our bestowal to you.' It's a commitment that you make and it is a responsibility that you accept." Limbaugh also attacked correspondent Connie Chung, demanding to know, "How many divorces has Connie had?" And he lamented the "quadrupling in divorce rates," saying, "We have a behavioral problem. We have a love problem. We have a spiritual problem."

Lets create a movement for a social just economy in the world free of the dependency of an oil economy and military intervention to support that dependency.  Domestically we need a new aboltionism that will abolish the culture of fear that supports the patriot acts. By disinvesting in the petro-chemical industry and military, we have billions free to invest in sustainable energy, sustainable jobs, and sustainable communities.  As long as there is no masses or organized people, both parties will continue to ignore the interests and needs of workers and majority of the worlds population  and serve the interests of corporations.

      Bad news from New mexico on their living wage law...   Tuesday, June 29, 2004  Coke Co. To Take 'Wage' to Court  By John T. Huddy Journal Staff Writer  A lawyer for Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Santa Fe said Monday he planned to seek an injunction in federal court to stop Santa Fe's "living wage" law until a federal case against the measure is decided.  "When (the motion for an injunction will be filed) ... I just can't answer that," said attorney Paul Kennedy of Albuquerque.  Kennedy confirmed he has talked to Coca-Cola and plans to file for a temporary injunction, "probably sometime in the next month."  Affected businesses are getting their payrolls ready for increased wages and city leaders have been gearing up to enforce the law if necessary.  A federal injunction would supersede state First District Judge Daniel Sanchez's decision Thursday to uphold the measure. It requires Santa Fe businesses with 25 employees or more to pay an $8.50-an-hour minimum wage.  An injunction could be narrow in scope, said Morty Simon, a local labor attorney and founder of the Santa Fe Living Wage Network. That is, it could stay enforcement of the law at all businesses in Santa Fe or only at Coca-Cola.  "Another issue is, ultimately, if we (living-wage supporters and the city) win the litigation, will it be retroactive," meaning, will businesses that haven't conformed to the law have to pay back wages, Simon questioned.  The Santa Fe minimum-wage law was supposed to take effect in January, but Sanchez, anticipating a trial, delayed it. He ruled the law was not retroactive in last week's ruling.  Local business owners and managers in state court challenged the state and federal constitutionality of the law. A group of business owners that opposed the law said it plans to appeal Sanchez's decision. No appeal had been filed as of Monday.  Meanwhile, Coca-Cola contends in its lawsuit that Santa Fe's measure will cause irreparable harm to affected businesses, among other arguments.  "I guess I'll have to increase the wages of my dishwashers. ... They were the only ones making less than $8.50," said Joe Hoback, owner of the Pink Adobe restaurant in Santa Fe. Hoback said that if a federal injunction halted the law, "then I would probably go back to paying them the original wage."  City Attorney Bruce Thompson and City Manager Jim Romero were not available for comment Monday.  City Councilor David Pfeffer, the lone dissenting council vote when the minimum-wage law passed in February 2002, said he had "a hunch that many, many businesses will just go ahead and bump their employees up to the $8.50 wage, who aren't making it now," despite a potential injunction.  Hoback and other local business leaders agreed that they're not that worried about the increase to $8.50 per hour.  At most local restaurants, waiters and waitresses already make above the $8.50 wage if tips are included, which the law allows in computing the wage equation.  It's the increase to $9.50 an hour in January 2006, then $10.50 an hour in January 2008 that concerns business owners and managers such as Hoback.  Coca-Cola human resources manager Kathy Medina said Friday that the company was updating its payroll to bump 13 of its 94 employees up to $8.50.  Medina said paying $8.50 wage to the 13, who were making an average of about $7.95 an hour, would likely not "hit us that hard" economically, she said. She said increasing the wages further will.  Hoback agreed.  "And we also have to take into consideration compaction," he said. That is, paying more to an employee who made $8.50 an hour because of the increase of lower-paid employees' wages.  Monday, city attorneys and officials met to discuss the city's enforcement actions.  Under the city wage law, employees who feel they are not being paid the living wage can file complaints with the city manager. Investigation of those grievances will be handled by Romero's living-wage designee, Carlos Martinez.  The law holds that employees cannot be terminated because they filed a complaint with the city, under the code's retribution clause.

       To Nader or Not to Nader...  The hotest debate within the progressive/left community is how to  handle the greens/Nader during this elecction. For some this is herasy  either way... To vote for Nader is to asure 4 more years of bush (Tom  Harmann)...To others is delusional to think "vote for Iraq War  presidential authority Kerry" will be progressive on any thing of  substance (Greens (both Cobb & Comeao).  I take a middle stance. I think from an individual point of view, to  vote for kerry in a winner take all political system is very  understandable, even logical and defendable from a progressive point of  view. Tom hartmann is correct, given our present system to think that a  vote for a progressive third party candidate in a race with two leading  candidates evenly divided is a vote for the less progressive  alternative of the two leading choices.  But on the other hand, should progressive organizations through their  support for a clearly nonprogressive candidate. This is where I think  we in the Peace and Justice community need to hold back. Should we  spend our hard earned resources to support a candidate who will push  nafta like legilation and increase military spending not decrease it. I  think as progressive organizations (like mid south Peace and Justice)  should stand back from using our meager resources to promote a  nonprogressive candidate.  So where does that leave us. We as organizatioons should not work for  any of the presidential candidates. are we on the sideliness...no...We need to keep building a movement  that will force whoever wins to respond to our progressive agenda. We  shall work to change the election laws to have instant runoff voting (  see greens usa material on subject). We shall educate the population on  the true mechinism for social change: an organized populace, not an  election. Never has social change happend because some new person is  elected to the senate or the white house. Social change happened  because masses of people made it happen.  in solidarity, red al  > > Posted by AL to Red Al's Musings at 6/30/2004 08:19:18 PM    allan lummus, Board Member, Mid-South Peace and Justice	 901-722-9545 (phone) 901-355-0584 (cell) home email: allanclummus@earthlink.net MSPJ webpage: http://midsouthpeace.org MSPJ weblog: http://midsouthpeace.blogspot.com

       urlLink Scrooge & Marley, Inc. -- The True Conservative Agenda   There is nothing "normal" about a nation having a middle class, even though it is vital to the survival of democracy.   As twenty-three years of conservative economic policies have now shown millions of un- and underemployed Americans, what's "normal" in a "free and unfettered" economy is the rapid evolution of a small but fabulously wealthy ownership class, and a large but poor working class. In the entire history of civilization, outside of a small mercantilist class and the very few skilled tradesmen who'd managed to organize in guilds (the earliest unions) like the ancient Masons, the middle class was an aberration.   If a nation wants a middle class, it must define it, desire it, and work to both create and keep it.   urlLink more

Greenwald: I thought going into this we would discover what we all knew -- that Fox News is a conservative news network, with an opinion relative to a conservative look at the world. But what I found is more troubling, more upsetting and more critical to democracy: Fox News is a Republican news network. It takes a Republican line, which is different from a conservative line.   There are many well-meaning, thoughtful conservatives who disagree with the Bush administration about the war, about the tax cuts, about the economy, about [ex-White House terrorism advisor] Richard Clarke ... None of that is ever seen on Fox News because they consistently support the political line that the Republican party will take at any given time, which is different from a conservative philosophy or approach.      urlLink for more

Officially, full sovereignty was handed from the Americans to the Iraqi Interim Government. But it was clear from the start that this was sovereignty in name, not in deed. First, there is the continued military occupation: 138,000 U.S. soldiers and Marines, plus 20,000 troops from other countries and an estimated 20,000 contractors, all fully under U.S. control and immune to Iraqi laws. Equally debilitating, however significantly less well reported upon, is the continued political and economic occupation by the Bush administration and its corporate allies

They want to defeat Bush. But see that task as only the beginning of their work. With convention delegates more liberal than the nominee on most issues, the foundation exists to move the party away from its centrist orientation. Whether Kerry is elected. Or not.

Administration officials haven't gone that far, but when Tom Ridge offered a specifics-free warning about a terrorist attack timed to 'disrupt our democratic process,' many people thought he was implying that Al Qaeda wants George Bush to lose. In reality, all infidels probably look alike to the terrorists, but if they do have a preference, nothing in Mr. Bush's record would make them unhappy at the prospect of four more years.
