      Bought a really detailed map of the area (Professor Pathfinder's Harvard University -- I recommend it).  I should've done that sooner.  I've been wandering in the darkness but no more.  No more inadvertently taking the longest path possible to get everywhere.  No more hoping and praying that the next corner would be familiar enough that I'd know where to turn next.  And all for just $4.95.  Plus a 5% rebate at the end of the year (bought it at the Coop).  Started delving into my reading.  Easily distracted by the Mets game, answering e-mails, eating, sleeping, and going to the bathroom.  It's slow going so far, but I have to admit it's kind of comforting to be a student again.  I can deal with reading assignments better than I can deal with 401k plans.

      Exploring Harvard Square this morning, then doing my reading for class on Tuesday.  This is just a placeholder for a post later today.  Most likely subjects -- Harvard Square, or "my reading for class."  We'll see which one gives me something funny to write about.  I'd put my money on Harvard Square.  At least there's no baseball strike.  I have a funny story about the baseball strike, actually.  I was talking to a couple of people and this one guy gets a cell phone call.  He hangs up.  "There's no baseball strike."  Someone called to tell him.  Not more than twenty seconds later, my cell phone rings.  "There's no baseball strike."  Someone called to tell me.  I thought this was hilarious.  This is how you know you're a baseball fan -- when someone calls you to tell you there's no strike.

      Assigned seats in our classes.  Each seat has a number, each student has a number, we make the match.  This way the professors have a seating chart and can call on us.  Can't wait.  Had a tour of the library today.  Printing costs 5 cents a page, copies cost 10 cents a page.  Huh?  The best line of the library tour, said by our tour guide (who was the nicest librarian I've ever met, by the way!) -- "This is the largest academic law library in the world.  I say "academic" because there is one library that's bigger.  The Library of Congress.  They're slightly bigger than we are.  Slightly."  The second best line of the library tour -- "In the bridge between buildings are some bean bag chairs.  Students like to sit in them.  And late at night, sometimes we find couples doing more than just sitting in them."  The third best line of the library tour -- "Over there is where you can talk on your cell phones.  It looks private but the way the walls are, we at the reference desk can hear every word you say.  So you may think it's private, but we can hear you."

      I think I heard "...and I have just one more piece of paper to give you..." about fifty times today.  Stacks and stacks of stuff.  Stuff like this:  Information Technology Services packet (printing costs 5 cents a page.  That kind of sucks.)  Lexis-Nexis ID cards, daily planner with pen, big glossy brochure, sweepstakes entry (can win a Lexus -- oh, I get it!  Lexis, Lexus!  So funny!!), and some advertising propaganda rectangular sheet of paper with no information on it.  Westlaw bookmark, pen, and law students handbook all in a fancy box, legal summary book, manual, ID cards, coffee mug, and fake velvet case (to match the Fleet Bank sunglasses case).  Apparently, Lexis and Westlaw are competitors in the legal research game. Each one wants to woo students to their system.  I'm not sure I fully understand yet.  Their tables at orientation were right next to each other.  I was kinda hoping they'd start fighting.  Celebrity Deathmatch: Lexis-Nexis v. Westlaw.  And no one but law students would be tuning in....  But it is a good song idea.  We'll see later.  Playing it Safe: A Guide for students, faculty, and staff  This guide introduces the R.A.C.E. acronym for fire safety --   R escue  A larm  C onfine  E xtinguish  (As opposed to  R un  A way  C arrying  E verything).  Services for students with disabilities brochure "The law school will make appropriate changes in examination procedures for students with special needs."  What if my special need is the answer key?  Yearbook order form ("the price goes up so act now...")  Privacy request form, in case you don't want your e-mail address made public.  This is useful because the e-mail addresses are composed of the first letter of your first name and the first 7 letters in your last name.  So if you keep it private, no one can ever figure it out...  Deferred examination policy -- "if four or more exams are scheduled in a row..."  How many classes are these people taking?  Four exams in a row?  Drug and alcohol policy -- "food and non-alcoholic beverages must be available at any event where alcohol is served."  Oh yeah?  Good food?  Is it free?

      Wednesday's observations, one day late (just got my computer hooked up to the network)  10:03 AM  We had an all-dorm-residents barbecue last night, and then the first Bar Review (the oh-so-law-student way of saying trip to a bar) later on at night.  It's nice that they had something organized going on so I wouldn't be stuck in my room watching American Idol.  Which actually was pre-empted by the Red Sox-Yankees game on the local Fox affiliate.  But American Idol is apparently such a phenomenon that they let viewers know during the Red Sox game -- I caught about a half hour inbetween barbecue and bar -- that it would air (in full!) after the news after the game.  Got back to my room at 11:30 in time to see the contestants waving goodbye.  But -- and this is truly pathetic -- I had my mom tape it for me, so I'll see it at some point in the future, probably after the winner's career has already come and gone twice over.  So far it's seemed like in most cases, there appear to be only 5 questions on the approved "first day of law school making conversation" question sheet, and always asked in this order:  (1) What's your name? (2) Where are you from? (3) What school did you go to? (4) What section are you in? (The entire first year class is divided into 7 sections of about 70 people, who attend all of the required classes as a group) (5) Did you come straight through from college? And if the answer to (5) is no, (5A) What did you do inbetween?  That pretty much covers most of the conversations.  I guess it's like that with any new situation.  But a big nametag with all of that information might help things along... it was kind of funny to watch some people just go from person to person asking the questions, trying simply to meet as many people as possible -- quantity over quality I suppose.  One guy, after we talked for about 90 seconds, simply said "Okay, I'm going to go meet someone else now."  Well, at least it's honest.  I found myself guilty a couple of times of saying dumb things in response to people's answers, just because I couldn't think of anything else to say and the silence was awkward.  Like:  SOMEONE ELSE: "I'm from California." ME: "Oh.  So this is pretty far away for you." HIM: "Yeah." ME: "It gets pretty cold here in the winter." HIM: "Right."  Yeah, I know it's pretty idiotic to imagine that anyone -- from no matter how far away -- has no conception that Boston may get cold in the winter.  10:43 AM (yes, just 40 minutes later)  Who knew that just walking to the bookstore and back could give me enough for another Weblog entry?  First off, I went to the bookstore because after I saved the file with the preceding entry, I realized I didn't have a floppy disk to copy it onto in order to transfer it to a cluster computer later on today and post it.  But before I could even get there, I passed by the Fleet Bank "Please, please sign up for an account" table.  "Have you signed up for your free Fleet Bank account yet?  Get a free mousepad, keychain, and white board."  Did they say mouse pad, keychain, AND white board?  Not "...OR white board?"  How can anyone pass that up?  The deal is that they want everyone -- money or not.  Sign up, get a checkbook, and if you decide you want the account, make a deposit at some point.  Otherwise, don't.  "But I don't know my mailing address," I said.  "Leave it blank -- just put your name and we'll find it," the scary man in the blue shirt said.  Well... okay....  Another student passed by:  SCARY MAN: "Have you signed up for your free Fleet Bank account yet?" STUDENT: "I've already got a bank account." SCARY MAN: "What bank?" STUDENT: "Bank One." SCARY MAN: "How are you going to make your withdrawals?  We've got an ATM right on campus." STUDENT: "I'm fine.  I'm happy with my account." SCARY MAN: "But this account is free -- and convenient.  We've even got an ATM right on campus." STUDENT: "Yeah, but I don't want to switch banks." SCARY MAN: "Why not?" STUDENT: "It's a family thing." SCARY MAN: "The bank account?  Don't you want your own bank account?" (...the student starts to walk away...scary man screams after him...) SCARY MAN (cont'd): "...and a free mouse pad, keychain, and white board?  How about a sunglasses case?"  So Fleet Bank is pretty desperate.  But that's not all!  I was walking back from the bookstore -- with my one disk, cost: 99 cents plus tax.  $1.04.  Which means I have 96 cents in change rattling around in my pocket.  But that's besides the point.  I'm walking back, and I see someone who looks vaguely familiar.  And I quickly realize who I've just passed -- remember on the second season of Survivor there was Nick, a guy who went to Harvard Law School? This was him.  I'm positive.  I didn't say anything, but I'm sure it was him.  He'd be in his 3rd year now I guess, so it makes sense.  A brush with fame.  Now all I need is to pass Alan Dershowitz later today and I'll have seen every famous person on this campus.  Or not.    9:16 PM  Back in my room, inbetween the first day of orientation and another bar outing.  Started out at 4:00 with a section meeting -- first time with the other 80 people who'll be in all my classes, plus our section professor.  Saw a classroom for the first time.  Each desk had a microphone.  Scary.  "Attention, Seat 55, your lights are on..."   My dorm room is beginning to show cracks -- the fluorescent light bulb won't stop flickering, and the sink has a real slow drain.  Someone told me to e-mail the dorm office -- so I'll see if I get a reply.  12:32 AM  I really don't like bars.  Too crowded, too noisy, too dark.  I can't think of a less effective way to meet people than to put all of them in a room ten times too small, turn out the lights, and play loud dance music.  Maybe it's just me.  I just haven't mastered the art of bar conversation.  Usually I'm too quiet to steer the conversation anyway, so I just sort of nod and stand there.  No one gets past the magic 5 questions anyway -- name, from where, what school, what section, take any time off inbetween -- that it's pointless.  I think the key to these conversations is to have a gimmick.  One of the five answers has to be something different, something enough to keep people from moving right past.  Like one guy was from Canada.  So he got lots of questions from people I'm sure he'd never ever heard before -- "is it cold up there?" "you like hockey?" "ever been to the states?"  I asked, in a brief moment of insanity, "so, how do you feel about Quebec secession?"  Yeah, that's a great bar question.  I want to find a gimmick.  "I have six fingers on each hand?"  Naw, too freaky.

      Posting from a computer cluster in a Harvard Law school building whose name begins with an "H."  I can't remember the name, just the first letter.  Got here this morning, moved into my dorm room.  Passed by a supermaket with a sign "Pick and Pay Supermarket."  Isn't that what you do at every supermarket?  Pick your food, then pay for it?  Anyway, my dorm room is nice.  Carpeted, clean, big window, lots and lots of closet space, drawers, outlets, necessary things like that.  Needed to buy a lamp though.  Not that much light.  This is insanely boring to read, isn't it?  I bought my books.  They're really heavy.  And expensive.  $513.05.  But the Harvard Co-Op Bookstore has this thing where at the end of the year you get back 5% of what you spend.  Why not just charge 5% less?  I guess they think I'll have a good feeling when at the end of the year I get a $50 check -- better than if it's just pennies less each time I buy something.  Or they think I'll forget and then they won't send me the check.  Yeah, that's it, it's all a ploy.  I seem to be the only person moving into my dorm who hasn't learned from experience how to effectively pack and move -- other people had wagons and wheelbarrows and baskets and crates and boxes and dollies and hand carts and lever-and-pulley systems and rickshaws and wenches and indentured servants.  I had my socks in one garbage bag, my underwear in another, my computer wires laying loose on the back seat of my parents' car -- so I had to make 14 trips in and out of the building -- protected by two doors that each required me to take out my key each time (signs: 'Do Not Prop Open -- Under Penalty of Death... no, I'm making up the last part) -- and into "the world's slowest elevator (tm)," while everyone else backs their U-Haul up to the entrance, pulls out their electronic robot moving device, and is fully unpacked in seventeen seconds flat.  Led to exciting elevator conversations like, "You really know how to pack," "Wow -- so quick and easy doing it your way," and "Can I please borrow your pack mule and sherpa when you're finished with them?"  But now I'm all unpacked, my books are bought (which unfortunately means I have to read them -- but, hey, the sign said I can return them before September 13th, so if I just read them all really quickly... there's $513.05 I can save right there!), and I'm just killing time until a dorm barbecue at 5:00.  Good thing they don't let us have any cooking devices in our rooms or the barbecue could start a fire.  Wait, that logic doesn't make any sense -- a barbecue could burn down the dorm anyway, with or without microwaves in the rooms.  Guess it's a good thing the barbecue's outside, not inside.

      Okay.  Starting to pack.  I'm faced with how to pull all these wires out of my computer and pack them in such a way that reassembling the whole thing isn't a monumental task on the order of building a nuclear explosive.  When I went down to college freshman year, I painstakingly applied different-colored Post-It flags to the ends of wires to mark what "thing" they plugged into (the big thing with the disk drives, whatever it's called, or the monitor, or the printer, or the wall...) but the flags came off en route and I was left completely perplexed.  Another time I tried leaving everything plugged in on one end, so I'd only have half the number of things to reattach, but I found that carrying things with dangling wires is dangerous, and tripping over oneself while carrying a computer would be a bad idea.  But I think by now I've done this enough that it shouldn't be problem.  Until I get there and find that I'm missing three wires and a mouse.  Or something like that...

      I can't legitimately make fun of existing questions and answers for prospective law students (see today's earlier entry along with yesterday's ramblings) without at least trying to create an alternative of my own.  So here goes:   Questions and Answers for Prospective Law Students, from someone who hasn't even started law school yet so has no real expertise on the issue   1. Should I go to law school? For me, it was either law school or figuring out what kind of job (a) I could get and (b) I really wanted to do.  And that's really hard.  So I chose law school.  But that's not as stupid as it sounds.  Because there are lawyer-like jobs that do sound interesting to me, and regardless of whether I decide I want to practice law, hopefully law school will (a) increase the number of jobs I can get, and (b) give me some more information and time to figure out what I really want to do.  Plus, it's three more years of school, and I already know I'm good at school.  I don't know if there's really any advice there, except to say that from the people I've talked to, it isn't as simple as just being 100% sure you want to sue big companies for doing mean things (or defend the big companies against those obviously-frivilous lawsuits), because there's lots of jobs for lawyers that aren't so obvious, and lots of other jobs where the law degree can help... or so I hope....  2. If I decide I want to go to law school, should I take the LSAT? Definitely.  And you should make sure to do well!  3. How? By answering most of the questions correctly.  Here's a hint: if Sally eats Steak on Sunday, then Fred definitely eats Fish on Friday. (If you've never taken the LSAT, I'm talking gibberish here, I know.)  4. How do I decide which law school to attend? Try the U.S. News rankings.  They're perfect in every way.  5. Is law school hard? Ask me in a few weeks.  I sure hope not.  6. My parents say I must go to either medical school or law school, or they'll cut me off financially.  How do I explain to them that my real passion is sculpture and my dream is to be a famous artist? Hold on a second, who's telling you not to be a famous artist?  But do you really want to be a  struggling  artist?  Doctor-artist sounds awfully cool, with kind of a whole renaissance man (or woman -- imaginary questioner didn't tell me his or her gender) thing going on.  What have you got to lose if your parents are paying?  Worst case scenario is you hate school and you drop out -- but if you don't give up your art along the way, what have you lost?  And if the art doesn't work out, this way you've got a pretty neat backup plan.  Don't demonize graduate school like it has to make you give up your dreams.  Demonize investment banking and management consulting instead.  They're the real enemies.  7. My girlfriend walked in on me and another girl--- This is for law school-related questions only, please.  8. No, just listen.  My girlfriend walked in on me and another girl studying for the LSATs together and now she's jealous.  What do I do? Like I said before, if Sally eats Steak on Sunday, then Fred definitely eats Fish on Friday, if you know what I mean....  (I don't even know what I mean... but it's getting late here, so give me a break...)  9. Thanks for the advice. You're welcome.  But that's really not a question.

      The University of Miami School of Law (insert your own joke here), has its own prelaw "29 Critical Questions" at http://www.law.miami.edu/admissions/29questions.html.  They're pretty lame too.    Of course I admit for humorous purposes I'm only using the parts of the answers that are funny, so it's really not as bad as I seem -- and I know I'm not being fair to them... but nevertheless... here's a sampling:  1. Should I go to law school?  Only you can answer this question.  2. Is law school as challenging as they say?  Yes - and no.   4. When should I apply?  There are over 185 ABA accredited law schools in the U.S., and although the admissions process is similar at each, there are important differences.  5. What are law schools looking for?  As the entering class profile is important to prospective students, faculty, and the legal community, law schools are looking for the most competitive applicants possible.   8. How is the job market? Will I get a good job after graduation?  People attend law school for a variety of different reasons, and thus, the definition of a "good" job after law school is different for everyone.  27. I have a documented disability. Should I disclose this information?  This will be entirely your decision.   28. What type of support systems are in place once students are enrolled?  Support systems among law schools vary from the formal to the very informal.   I hope taking these out of context and making fun of them isn't slander.*  (*Note: "Slander" is a real legal term.  But since I haven't started law school yet, I don't really know what it means.  So forgive me if I'm getting it all wrong and this isn't slander, it's libel.  Or it isn't libel, it's battery. Or it isn't battery, it's just a tort.  A tort with whipped cream and glazed kiwis.  Yum.)

      I just discovered the "Law Discussion Area" message board on Princeton Review's website (www.review.com).  I think someone ought to be monitoring the board a little more closely.  Five of the most recent topics:  "Is my roommate right to be mad at me for listening to Eminem?" "Closet Homosexuals in Hollywood" "Do we brief ALL of the cases in our texts?" "Lawyer unhappiness" "I squirted my foam all over two chicks!!"  That's quite a mix, isn't it?  And... even more fun with law-related web sites... "The Incoming One-L FAQ" at http://www.ilrg.com/glasser.html features answers to common questions about starting law school.  Some highlights:  (Note: I don't really mean to pick on this specific web site as being any more ridiculous or less well-intentioned than any other resource.  I'm mostly just trying to be funny, and, if there's any point I'm trying to make it's that most well-meaning sources of "advice" are pretty lame and obvious.  It's really nothing personal against this site -- and if I was really diligent and really had readers who were depending on me for that type of thing, I'd surely do some research and find a site that was truly ridiculous.  But, in a pinch, this one will have to do.)  [3] How can I get ready for Law School? Are you sitting on the fence in a relationship? This is the time to fall off the fence, either one way or another. Do you have a place to live? Are you planning on getting dental surgery? Take care of these kinds of things *before* school starts.  Thanks, Incoming One-L FAQ.  I was going to start law school (a) without a place to live, and (b) needing dental surgery.  But now, thanks to that answer, I guess I'll cave in and finally leave the bench I've been living under.  And I'll read the fine print of my health insurance (see my August 8th entry for more about health insurance) and see a dentist.  [5] Are study groups a good idea? This is a very subjective call.  Helpful.  [8] How should I take notes? Use a pen. *rim shot* Seriously, you got through undergrad, you already know how to take notes.   Is this really worth my time?  [9] Socrates Unplugged The Paper Chase was a movie. This is the real world. The fact is, that at most top schools, it is considered very bad form among professors to torture students publicly. Some teachers hit students randomly, others call on the same people, looking for someone to parrot their take on things, yet others go in the order of the seating chart in a democratic fashion.  Uh, that's not a question.  Gotcha, Incoming One-L FAQ!  [11] Grades Unless you totally freak out and write gibberish, you'll pass. But is passing enough? It depends where you go to school. It isn't fair, but the facts of life are that if you are at a second-tier school, you are best advised to do particularly well.   Uh, that's not a question either.  But I'll let it slide in favor of making fun of the retarded answer.  "You are best advised to do particularly well?"  Come on, is this helping anyone?  From an imaginary testimonial ad for the Incoming One-L FAQ: "Well, I thought I ought to try and fail," thought Johnny Moron of Thomas Cooley Law School and Chinese Buffet, "but then I read the advice in the Incoming One-L FAQ and now I'm a straight-D student.  Thanks, Incoming One-L FAQ!"

      The worst part about packing to move somewhere: it's always too early to do laundry.  If I do my laundry now, by Monday I'll have 3 pairs of socks that are dirty, 3 pairs of boxers, a couple of t-shirts, and maybe a pair of shorts that will all need laundry again.  And there's nothing less fun than getting to a new place and already having laundry to do.  But if I wait until Sunday, I'll have a hundred other things to do -- like alphabetize my CDs, test my pens to see if they're out of ink, and sort through random piles of paper looking for the ones I'll need to start a new random pile of papers in my dorm room -- and won't want to do laundry.  And then I'll end up going up there with no clean clothes.  Which is stupid.  So I guess I should do laundry now.  Or tonight, after I take my socks off.  Or now, but take off my socks.  And if I go anywhere, not wear socks.  Or wear socks with holes in them that I don't want to take with me anyway.  See the dilemma??

      Need to start packing.  I'm hoping by now (after four years of college and a year and a half of my own apartment) I've figured out what I really do and don't need.  I hate the feeling at the end of the year when you start packing things up to take home and realize that you didn't use half of the things you had.  In that spirit, here's a list of 15 things my mom would want me to bring with me but I know I won't use them.   Top Fifteen Things My Mom Thinks I'll Need At Harvard But I Really Won't   (can't I come up with a shorter way of saying that?)  15. Paper towel holder 14. Three pairs of identical blue pants 13. Coasters 12. Extra extension cords 11. Pillow sham 10. Soap dish  9. Industrial-size box of dryer sheets (because one is never enough...) 8. Dust ruffle 7. Ugly green shirt I never wear 6. Boots (for the blizzard...) 5. Spare toothbrush 4. Something made of glass that is destined to one day break into tiny pieces 3. Extra vacuum bags to go with the vacuum I'm not taking 2. Industrial-size jar of peanut butter 1. The kitchen sink (yeah, I guess I could do better...)  And, because I can't resist, here's a companion top 10 list for your reading pleasure...   Top Ten Things The Most Competitive Law Student at Harvard Will Bring to School   10. His first-year casebooks, all of which he's already read 9. Bag of banana peels (for strategic placement outside exam rooms) 8. Pens with invisible ink, for generous lending to classmates 7. Master key to the library 6. Box of laxatives, for spiking the punch at law school parties the night before finals 5. Paper shredder 4. Complete set of audio tapes: "First Year of Harvard Law School for Dummies" 3. Those glasses they sell on late-night infomercials that have mirrors in them so you can see behind you 2. Semi-automatic weapon 1. His father's checkbook, and the home addresses of all of his professors

      Got my orientation schedule for next week.  Some highlights:  8:30 a.m. - 9:30 a.m.   Preparation for Registration 9:30 a.m. - 10:00 a.m.   Registration  Why would it take an hour to prepare for something that only takes half an hour?  1:00 p.m. - 3:00 p.m.   Dean's Welcome Lunch, Jarvis Field Tent  Maybe I'm wrong, but whenever I see the word "tent" in the location for "lunch," I get very unexcited.  I picture hamburgers.  Or little sandwiches on platters.  I also picture hot sun, really long lines, and a generally underwhelming experience.  But maybe I'm wrong.  4:30 p.m. - 5:30 p.m.   Financial Aid Orientation  "The bank is a quarter of a mile South.  You are currently facing West.  Here are your compasses."  9:30 a.m. - 10:15 a.m.  Library Tour, enter front steps  As opposed to from the roof.  I'm finding it hard to imagine there's 45 minutes worth of stuff to see in the library.  Unless they're going to have us shelve books, or complete a short research assignment while we're there.  I remember a "library orientation" in high school where we had to find things "hidden" in books -- kind of like a scavenger hunt, only without the fun.  Like, "use the Dewey Decimal system to find a book about Astrophysics," and "find a New York Times article about the death of President Taft on microfilm."  That was so much fun!!  And useful!!   10:20 a.m. - 11:20 a.m.   Campus Tour, immediately following  Well, first of all, it's not "immediately following."  There are five minutes inbetween the two tours.  And secondly, I hope the length of the two tours is not commensurate with the amount I'll be spending in each location -- "well, for every hour you spend anywhere on the campus, you'll be spending forty-five minutes in the library."  Hmmm.  5:00 p.m. - 7:00 p.m.   All School Party, Jarvis Field Tent  I don't know if I can stay up that late!!  (And the tent again?  Come on...)  8:00 p.m. - 10:00 p.m.   Boat Cruise.  Tickets, Pound 330  I have to buy tickets for something?  Aren't I paying enough?  And I hope "Pound 330" is a room number and not the price of the tickets, because 330 pounds is a lot of money.  Friday, September 27th 7:05 p.m.   Red Sox vs. Tampa Bay.  Tickets, Pound 330  Yeah, if they're not on strike.  Red Sox tickets, I'll pay 330 pounds for, it's fine.  But did they have to pick the game against Tampa Bay?  Is Tampa Bay even going to show up to play this meaningless late September game all the way up North in Boston?  They were mathematically eliminated from the postseason in June, are they even still getting paid?  But, honestly, this activity I'm looking forward to.  And it's not in a tent!

      Damn.  I spoke too soon.  See my last line below about American Idol -- "I think Tamyra's a shoo-in to win."  Well, she went first tonight and just sang Patti Labelle's "New Attitude," and gave me an entirely "new attitude" about her singing.  Eh.

      Another "American Idol" episode in just 5 minutes.  I'm a little concerned that I'll probably miss the final two shows because of law school.  But I guess I can tape them.  That sounds kind of pathetic.  Taping "American Idol."  I wonder if I'll be the only person at Harvard Law School taping "American Idol" on Tuesday night.  Gosh.  I'm kind of looking forward to seeing my dorm room.  There were a bunch of reasons I chose to live in the dorms, not least of which being that it was less work to sign up for a dorm than to start looking for an apartment.  But also there's the location advantage -- a block from classes instead of potentially a subway ride, bus ride, or 20-minute walk -- which in the harsh Boston winters (at least that's my stereotyped image... but I'm sure it'll be no different from New York...) could be pretty unpleasant.  And there's the advantage that everyone in the building will also be a law school student, so it should make it easier to make some friends and find people to hang out with.  And the ethernet connection onto the Harvard network is a definite plus.  And, finally, the cost difference -- including the savings on utilities -- is a nice bonus.    But there are negatives -- the size, and the lack of a kitchen (and a Cambridge ordinance banning any kind of cooking appliances in the rooms -- microwaves, etc) most notably (I sprang for the more expensive dorm -- with my own bathroom and my own thermostat, with air conditioning, so there are some usual negatives about a dorm that I'm avoiding).  But today I realized the positive side of no kitchen and no microwave -- my room won't smell like food.  See, there's always a silver lining!  And now, it's time to watch "American Idol."  I think Tamyra's a shoo-in to win.  But I reserve the right to edit this weblog entry to make it look like I chose right no matter what.

      A friend of mine who's going to be a 3L somewhere this fall has to write a paper this week for a pre-semester course next week on Professional Responsibility.  Lawyer ethics (oxymoron?) and stuff like that.  How ironic would it be if someone plagiarized the paper for that course?  "Uh... I didn't know I wasn't allowed to copy someone else's work for my paper on ethics...."  I flipped through a book called "Planet Law School" in a bookstore this afternoon.  Okay, I did more than just flip through it.  I sat down on the floor (Barnes and Noble used to have more chairs... have they finally decided that making it easy and comfortable for people to read the books for free in the store is a bad idea?) and read a few chapters.  The author of this one thinks all incoming law students should spend the summer beforehand learning the law and then not buy the casebooks and sporadically go to class.  I'm not in any position to cast doubt on whether this method can lead to good grades -- but it sure does seem like a waste of being enrolled in school.  Maybe I'll feel differently once I get there, I don't know.  Saw the Jennifer Aniston movie, "The Good Girl" this afternoon.  No lawyers in that one.  A complete aside -- ever since "American Beauty" came out and was successful, I've noticed a lot of movies about relatively ordinary people living relatively typical lives.  And these relatively typical lives are miserable, unfulfilling, and without meaning.  Personally, I find this more than a little disturbing and frightening.  These movies scare me into thinking that everyone's lives are like that, and I don't know that that's true.  I also wonder if the people who live these kinds of lives -- in "The Good Girl," Jennifer Aniston plays a retail clerk in a small town, and I'm sure there are millions of people in roughly the same situation -- go see these movies, and what they think about the "your ordinary life is worthless and meaningless" attitude that is portrayed.  I don't know how much sense I'm making... but, regardless, that's just the reaction I had to the movie...

      Should I rent "The Paper Chase" and completely scare myself about law school (now just a week away...)?  Nah.  Instead, I just watched Albert Brooks' "The Muse" on Comedy Central.  His previous film, "Mother," was really funny.  So funny, in fact, that when "The Muse" came out a few years ago I drove an hour to the nearest theater it was playing in, just to see it on the day it opened.  It's not as funny as "Mother" (but, then again, nothing really is), but tonight when I saw it in the TV Guide, I figured I'd give it a second chance.  It's okay.  Recommended.  But see "Mother" first!  And "Defending Your Life," which is good too.  Anyway, the relevant part of this mostly irrelevant weblog entry is that the movie gave me a few more opportunities to identify "Interesting Jobs that Lawyers Have."  I'm not sure that this guy was a lawyer, but he seemed like one, and being a Film Development Executive seemed like an interesting job that a lawyer could have.  And, just to make up for the irrelevance of today's entry (or add to it?), a short sketch.  Actually, it's more like an idea for a cartoon I would draw if I could draw.  Picture this: a law school courtyard filling with people moving out -- big boxes, cars with open trunks, etc.  The words underneath:  "Why's everyone moving out?" "Didn't you hear?  The U.S. News rankings came out.  We slipped three spots."  Huge laughter.  Maybe?  I hope?  Maybe I need "The Muse."

      I've been following the discussions on a message board for incoming Harvard Law students at a website called HLcentral.com.  Many of the posts have actually been pretty helpful -- about which cell phone providers have the best service, how first-year recruiting works, what banks have branches near campus, whether it's useful to be part of a study group -- but some posts have been simply inane.  I feel bad for saying that, because I'm sure the people who posted had legitimate questions and just didn't realize exactly what they were asking... but I can't resist sharing some of the highlights.  They're all taken verbatim from the website (except I've corrected some typos).  "A tiny matter, I know, but I'd love a response: I'm trying to budget for food and such, and I was wondering if the tap water in the dorms is potable."  (The reply, which was funnier than the question: "Have you ever been to Cambridge before? I'll assume not. You should rest assured though that the Law School is not located in a place akin to Cambodia. Cambridge is a fully function city where they do have tap water that meets various health regulations.")  "With the passing of baseball legend Ted Williams over the weekend, I've (for some reason) heard a lot about the tunnel in Boston named after him. Is this something that connects the Cambridge area at all?"  (I love the preface... "with the passing of...")   "I'm going to be in [the dorms] next year, and I wonder what the kitchens are like. Are some pots and pans available, or do we need to bring all those? Any common ingredients available?"  (Uh, do you really want to use someone's else's pots and pans?  And I know by common ingredients she probably meant salt and sugar and stuff, but on first read it sounds a little messed up, doesn't it?)   "I know there are common bathrooms in the [dorms], but there are separate shower stalls (with a door/curtain), right?" (Come on...!)  "I'm from Texas, so we're not used to much cold weather here. Are there any special items/clothes that I need to buy to handle the cold weather?"  And, finally... (and I swear I am not making this up -- check the website!)  "I was just wondering about how we go to the bathroom at HLS. Do you just walk out of class, or must you raise your hand and ask permission from the Professor? My old high school made us raise our hands, and then get a bathroom pass from the Professor. I figured HLS would do something like this, makes sense. But I might be embarrassed y'know? :) Does anyone know how to get fake bathroom hall passes so we can just leave class without making the hand-raising scene?"

      There's an article on Slate.com today called  urlLink Letters to a Young Law Student , with advice for incoming law students (like me!).  Basically it's three tips for law school mental health: (1) Know why you are going, (2) Know why you are not going, and (3) Have a life.  Not really much to argue with there.  (Except that advice like that gets its own article... although it is just Slate, not the New York Times magazine...)  The author, a lawyer (obviously), warns against getting swept into the law school tide and pushed into doing things just because everyone else is -- and by "things," she means ending up at a corporate law firm.  You know, if there's one theme that ties together everything I've heard and read about law school it's that (1) corporate law firms are evil, horrible places and (2) everyone ends up working for them.  I understand they offer a lot of money, and I understand they look nice on a resume, but what I don't understand is what turns the tide -- apparently (all I have to go on is what I've heard and read -- so this is probably a gross overstatement of the truth) virtually everyone goes into law school committed to never working for a corporate law firm, finding his or her own passion, not selling out, doing good for the world, etc.  And then at some point in the course of law school, they all somehow get brainwashed by the corporate recruiters and end up working for Long, Boring, and Hard, attorneys at law.  So my question is "how does this happen?"  And it's not even that I'm personally so dead set against working for a corporate firm -- I feel stupid admitting it, but I don't really have any idea what lawyers at a firm actually do, so I certainly don't feel informed enough to know what I want to do after graduation -- but I'm just curious what happens at law school to change everyone's mind, or at least make the idea of "selling out" palatable and acceptable to people who were dead-set against it beforehand.  I think that's enough rambling for tonight.  Hopefully in a few months I'll have a better idea why corporate law is so evil yet popular and I can edit this entry to make believe I had it all figured out even before I started.

      I went to the Mets game this afternoon, figuring that I ought to do as many "outside things" as I can before all the indoor stuff -- classes, studying, crying -- begins.  Disregarding how horrible the Mets are -- and they really are terrible -- what's really interesting are the advertisements all over the outfield wall and the between-innings scoreboard filler.  One of the Mets' biggest sponsors appears to be Acela -- you know, the high-speed trains that have been taken out of service due to safety issues.  There's a sign on the bleachers behind the outfield wall -- "hit this sign and win a free ticket on Acela."  Like that's an incentive now.  (And, besides, how many ballplayers take the train -- and if they did, can't they afford to buy their own tickets?  I mean, if they can't, is there even any hope for the rest of us?)  But funnier still was the between-innings promo sponsored by Acela -- a mock movie trailer for the Mets, with the Acela logo all over it, with printed quotes like -- "high speed action at every turn," "unending excitement," and "a thrill ride like no other."  Meant to apply to the Mets games, I know -- if you watched the game you know it didn't -- but quite a scary proposition when applied to Acela.  "High speed action at every turn?"  On a train?  No thanks.  "A thrill ride like no other?"  I think I'd rather walk.  Of course, the worst offender is the ad right next to the one for Acela.  "Off-Track Betting."  Now that's not really the kind of thing I want to think about when I think about taking the train....

      Just a few minutes ago, in the weblog entry below, I introduced chapter one of the "Interesting Jobs that Lawyers Have" series (see below for more).  And then it crossed my mind that such a discussion would be incomplete without an associated "Terribly Horrible Jobs that Lawyers Have" companion series.  And so I present chapter one of the "Terribly Horrible Jobs..." series, from an episode of Dateline NBC I saw a few weeks ago.  On the episode of Dateline I saw, the correspondent was interviewing the lawyer for a church in Camden, New Jersey, where the priests were being accused of sexually molesting teenage boys in the 1970s.  The lawyer was fighting to have the lawsuits against the church thrown out because the time since the alleged incidents occurred exceeded the statute of limitations.  This, I submit, is the perfect example of a "Terribly Horrible Job that Lawyers Have."

      From ESPN.com's article this afternoon on the ongoing major league baseball negotiations: "Rob Manfred, the owners' top labor lawyer, has repeatedly expressed optimism, but even he admitted little headway was made at the bargaining table Wednesday."  Some people see nothing extraordinary about that sentence, and, admittedly, a few weeks ago I probably wouldn't have either.  But that's before it sunk in that I'm really going to law school, and I started wondering whether I really want to be a lawyer.  Maybe a little late for that question.  But, nevertheless, I've started to keep my eye open for "Interesting Jobs that Lawyers Have."  (I've put that in quotes and capital letters because I'm thinking that I'll come back to that theme in future weblog entries, and this way I can avoid a lengthy introduction like I'm writing now... so we can just call this entry chapter one in the "Interesting Jobs that Lawyers Have" series.)  So when I was reading the ESPN article, I didn't think about the potential baseball strike, or wonder if negotiations would go better tomorrow, or click on the fancy pop-up ad for Orbitz.com on the top of the ESPN webpage.  Instead, I noticed that Rob Manfred, "the owners' top labor lawyer," probably has a pretty interesting job.  And he's a lawyer.  So there is at least one interesting job that lawyers have.   That makes the score Lawyers 1, Investment Bankers 0.  Hopefully I'll find more "Interesting Jobs that Lawyers Have" before my three years of law school are up.  Hopefully.

      To get back on track with the law school theme... here's a short comedy sketch based on a horrible nightmare I had last night.  It's called: "First Day of Law School."   First Day of Law School   Lights up on a classroom.  Lots of students who look really smart.  They all wear glasses.  Two pairs.  One on their eyes and one on their foreheads.  That wasn't really part of the nightmare.  But it sounds funny now so I'll run with it.  A teacher -- oops, I guess I mean professor -- stands at the front of the classroom.  He's wearing three pairs of glasses.  No, make it four!  PROFESSOR And that, my friends, is the meaning of life.  Any questions?  An overeager student -- let's call her "Target Practice" -- "Betsy Target-Practice" -- shouts out a question.  BETSY TARGET-PRACTICE Will that be on the final exam?  PROFESSOR Yes, Ms...   He checks his seating chart.  PROFESSOR (cont'd) ...Target-Practice.  That will be on the final exam.  Which is right now.  The professor hands out the final exams.  Spotlight on me.  I don't have a pen.  ME Uh oh.  I frantically search for a pen.  In my knapsack.  In my pocket.  In my sleeve.  But I'm out of luck.  And then, a brainstorm.  I grab a pen from the pocket protector of my neighbor.  Because smart people who wear two pairs of glasses always have pocket protectors, and always carry extra pens.  ME Phew!  I take a copy of the exam.  I begin to write.  But the pen is out of ink.  Once again, I am frantic.  But I get an idea.  I take the point of the pen and stab myself in the arm, letting out a small trickle of blood.  I have the blood drip into the ink-holding compartment of the pen, where it begins to collect.  I am home free.  ME What a relief.  I open the test booklet and read the instructions.  In big bold letters it reads, "No Red ink.  Black or Blue ink only."  I think to myself -- "Many of my classmates come from extraordinarily wealthy families.  You might say they are... blue-blooded."  ME A-ha!  And as I reach over towards the boy sitting next to Betsy Target-Practice -- we can call him Jimmy Donated-Library -- and get my hand into the pen-stabbing position, I wake up.  And realize it's only a dream.  And resolve to watch more TV and stop reading about law school and the horrors of the Socratic Method.  Because I am poisoning my subconscious.  And I'm sure Wanda Legacy-Admission would agree.

      Continuing the TV theme (see comments on NBC's "Meet My Folks" below), tonight I watched what has become my only summer TV habit, FOX's "American Idol."  Around the beginning of June, I told myself I wasn't going to watch any TV all summer, except for a couple of Mets games here and there.  That lasted about two months actually, with only a few rare exceptions.    But then a few weeks ago I discovered "American Idol" and the joy of hoping that a bunch of reasonably talented singers can screw up on live TV.  In case you live in a cave, here's how it works -- they held auditions for people who can sing, and chose a bunch of them to be on the show.  Each week they each sing a song that fits the week's theme (for example, "Songs of the '70s," "Songs of the '60s," or "Songs that weren't any good when they came out, and certainly aren't any better now"), the "celebrity" judges  -- Paula Abdul, Randy Jackson (a record producer; is he Michael's brother?  Or are they just pretending he's famous for the show?), and a British guy who is really pretty funny (by funny I mean that he insults the contestants and tries to make them cry) -- give their opinions, and then the American public (or at least the three or four teenage girls who are really into this show) votes by phone for their favorite, and the one with the least number of votes gets kicked off for next week.  They're down to 5 contestants.  Tonight's theme was "Burt Bacharach songs."  And, yes, that was as exciting as it sounds.  Burt Bacharach himself, in one of the many segments of filler necessary to turn 5 songs into an hour of television, helped the contestants choose their songs.  Then he apparently lost his ability to hear.  This was not the right genre of music for 18-24 year old aspiring pop singers.  Burt Bacharach songs are musically pretty complicated, it seems to me, and don't really have the melodic hooks that make them fun to listen to even when they're being butchered.  So the show was, well, boring at its best.  And in the case of one contestant, actually painful.  My ears began to bleed as the notes got flatter and flatter until it was like she was singing the national anthem at a little league baseball game.    But that was the best part of the show.  Because, just like it's secretly fun when the stock market falls a thousand points, it's kind of entertaining to watch someone mess up on live television.

      I know this has nothing to do with law school, but... I was watching the new NBC reality show, "Meet My Folks."  The premise is that there's a girl and her parents, and three guys each want to "win" a week-long vacation to Hawaii with the girl.  And the parents get to pick the guy.  Over the course of a weekend, throughout which, dirty secrets about the three guys are revealed (like, "Tom cheated on his SATs," or "Jason enjoys videotaping himself being intimate with his dates, without them knowing," or "Bill's a child molester.")  Aside from the fact that the show is having parents push their daughters into the arms of a sleazy guy they hardly know for a week in Hawaii, it all seems like pretty harmless fun.  But they're ignoring the real ratings winner hidden within.  I think it would be much more fun to reverse it.  Single parent, and the kids pick the date from a bunch of hopefuls.  We reveal dirty secrets about these middle-aged divorced guys -- after all, much more entertaining than "oh, those wacky kids," would be "oh, those sick, sick adults."  Picture it.  Janet, 40 years old, 300 pounds, who hasn't had a date in twelve years -- and the choices are equally appealing -- with the winner chosen by her children, ages 5, 6, and 9.  Well, I'd watch it.  (Of course, I'm watching it anyway...)

      As I continue my pre-law-school reading (see comments on "One L" and "Broken Contract" below)... I just finished "Law School Confidential," which bills itself "a complete guide to the law school experience."  I'm a little disturbed that it talks about how doing some studying before law school starts -- taking a course or buying some law-related tutoring software -- can be helpful.  Because with two weeks left, I'm just about out of time, and I don't know the difference between  collateral estoppel  and  concilium plebis .    (I did buy a dictionary, and those are in fact two terms I have randomly selected to use because they sound complicated and have lots of syllables.  And, even though I opened the dictionary to find them, I did not look at the definitions, so it is not an exaggeration in the least for me to say I do not know the difference between them.)

      Okay, it's officially sinking in that I have two weeks until law school.  Not that I don't want to go, but new things are always scary.  I decided to comparison shop for my textbooks on the Internet, quickly finding that (a) they're all expensive, (b) regardless what site you buy them from.  So I think I'll wait and try my luck with used books in the Harvard bookstore.  By my rough calculation, retail price of the books for my 4 classes should be about $700.  But how can someone feel guilty about buying textbooks -- again, after what tuition costs, everything is cheap, and besides, you have to buy textbooks, there are no options here, it's a necessary cost... but if I can save $10 by buying something used, I'll at least feel like I'm allowed to go see a movie.

      Another book review -- Scott Turow's "One L."  Well, it's not as scary as people say it is.  An e-mail from my soon-to-be "resident assistant" in the law school dorms warns us not to read it if we haven't already.  But it's really not that bad -- and certainly not worth the effort people seem to make to assure incoming students it's untrue and exaggerated.  I admit, clearly Scott Turow got way too wrapped up in grades and classes and studying and competition.  So when looked at under the lens of "this is how he perceived it," the facts he presents don't seem that unrealistic -- there's a lot of reading, you'll probably get called on in class, it's a bad idea to be unprepared for stuff, tests are long, and some people study way too hard.  He admits after the first set of exams that all of his extra diligence didn't really affect how much he was able to master the material and how well he did on the tests.  Didn't he learn any lessons in college?  You can always study too much -- and there will always be people who do.  And the "scary professor" he talks about -- only calls on people once in the semester.  Once you're called on for one day, you're safe.  Uh, okay, so what's the big deal?

      A quick comment on the book list I received in the mail along with my class schedule yesterday -- could they maybe give the textbooks more interesting names?  Even if just to fool us?  My contracts book is called "Contracts Cases and Doctrine."  My Criminal Law book is called "Cases and Materials on Criminal Law."  And most stimulating, my Civil Procedure book is called "Civil Procedure."  I mean, I'm sure they're fine textbooks, and I have no illusion that the reading is going to be like a Dave Barry column.  But if that Civil Procedure book was instead named, "The Crazy World of Civil Procedure," or "Civil Procedure for Debt-laden Law Students," or "Civil War -- I mean Procedure," maybe, just maybe, I'd look forward to buying the book.  At least until I looked at the price tag.  (No idea as of now what these books cost.  But compared to tuition, the books -- heck, anything! -- is cheap.)

      Today I finished reading "Broken Contract," by Richard Kahlenberg, one of two "famous" memoirs of life as a law student at Harvard (Scott Turow's "One L" being the other one -- and next on my reading list).  Interesting -- basically asking the question "how can someone balance being a liberal with being a lawyer?"  Spends a lot of time talking about the recruiting process -- the pressure to go to a big corporate law firm.  And how easy it is to make that choice, as opposed to going into public service or anything else.  Not just because of the salaries, but because they're there, on campus, wooing people, while the other jobs don't need to do that.    Just like college -- the investment banks and consulting firms have to come to campus and recruit, and they have to offer tremendous salaries, because without that, no one will take the jobs.  The good jobs -- not financially, but in terms of quality of life, fulfillment, etc -- don't need to pay huge salaries, and certainly don't need to come to campus to recruit, because people will seek them out and those jobs will be filled regardless.  Thinking about it that way kind of illustrates, at least for me, how bad some of these investment banking and similar jobs must be, considering all they need to do.  People are lining up to find entry-level administrative assistant jobs in advertising for $18,000 a year, without ad agencies needing to recruit like mad, but McKinsey has to wine and dine students on campuses across the country -- using significant time and money for the recruiting process -- and still as to pay people $75,000 a year to start.  Do I have any idea if I will end up at a corporate law firm?  No, not now.  The idea doesn't sound that thrilling, but I can't say I look around and see lots of my friends with jobs I envy.  Sure, there are awesome jobs out there (and of course my list of what's awesome is sure to be different from most other people's) -- writing for Saturday Night Live, being a working songwriter, writing speeches for politicians would be cool -- but what's the easy path to get there?  Scary thought is just like law school serves as a fine way to postpone finding the "path to adult career-hood" for three more years, I could certainly envision graduating and feeling like spending a few years at a big law firm would serve the same function -- and then where does it end?  If everything's a fine way to postpone actually having to seek out what will truly bring fulfillment, you never quite get there.  That's a little too deep for the fourth entry in a weblog, I know.  To my loyal audience of one (hi, mom!), I promise something lighter tomorrow.

      I received my course schedule in the mail today.  I open it up and the first thing I notice -- two of my professors are "E. Warren" and "R. Kennedy."  Earl and Robert?  No.  It's Elizabeth and Randall.  But still!  Maybe you really do need a famous name in order to teach at Harvard Law School.

      I got a whole packet of information the other day about the law school insurance plan.  Classes, they send me nothing.  But health insurance, I get a carton full of stuff.  Not so busy today, so I read what they sent.  A few observations:  Because it's not a dental plan, injuries to teeth are only covered when not due to a "biting or chewing" incident.  So if I fall on my head and break a tooth, great, I'm covered.  But if I bite into a rock, no such luck.  Ambulance rides are only covered for certain "participating ambulance services."  Because when you need an ambulance, of course you're always going to be the one calling.    (I suppose one of those "medic alert" bracelets would come in handy in a case like this -- "If I am injured and require an ambulance, please use one of the following companies: Hospital Express, Bleed-n-Go Ambulance Service, Hit-n-Run Emergency, Bob's "Stretch"-er Limousines, or No Frills Emergency Room Wheelbarrows, Inc.  Do not under any circumstances allow me to be placed in a Roger's Ambulance and Dog Catcher vehicle -- it is not covered by my insurance.)  Not covered: voluntary sterilization, tattoo removal, and "repetitive procedures (such as injection of varicose veins or hemorrhoids)."  "The removal of wisdom teeth is covered only if the teeth are impacted in the bone."  Exciting to think about.  The plan excludes coverage for "treatment for obesity... except as required by applicable law."  Hmmm.  I guess I'll learn about those laws in my "Obesity Law" class.

      Hi.  Welcome to my Weblog.  In a few weeks, I'll be a first-year law student at Harvard Law.  And this is just a place for me to record my thoughts and observations related (or unrelated) to law school.   E-mail me  if you stumble across this and think it's funny.

      Doing contracts reading at 11:30 is not so fun.  But I had Gilbert and Sullivan rehearsal until 11:00.  And wasted tons of time this afternoon.  So I'm stuck reading late.  Almost done though.  I was not offered the production editor position with the technology journal that I interviewed for last week, but actually that's totally cool because I think I'm getting involved in enough that any more will put demands on my time I'd rather not be there.  What's dumb is that the guy from the journal had to be really careful so as not to turn all of these people he's rejecting for the editor slots away from doing any work at all for the journal... and so it begs the question why have these couple of slots with an interview process when there's the risk it'll just sour people on the whole journal?    That may not make sense without some background on what the journal does and what these editor slots are.  I'll clear it up after I finish the contracts reading.  In the meantime, I leave you, my loyal reader(s?) hopelessly confused.  Apologies.

      A few notes on today and yesterday:  At noon today, my dorm building had a study break to go get crepes.  You know, like pancakes.  Kind of odd.  But what was really sad is that in this building of probably close to 200 people, only 5 showed up to go.  I mean, everyone has to eat *something* around noon, and it's not like there's tons of other stuff going on....  Well, my building's not very social to begin with -- we have our own bathrooms, so there's really no reason to be wandering the halls or anything like that.  But still, 5 people?  They missed out, actually,  The crepes were good.  Yesterday I sub-cited for the Environmental Law Review (that's footnote-checking for the non-law students -- and non-loyal Weblog readers).  In the library for three hours checking footnotes.  Could you imagine anything more fun than that?  The ELR (yeah, it has an acronym) is actually one of the more civil journals -- they just make you do the work for the three hours there, and they give you all the sources and everything.  The other journals make you rummage through the Harvard library system finding the books yourself, and give you an assigned number of pages, no matter how long it takes -- the technology one has done that... my section is due on Friday.  Hopefully I'll get to it by then.  I saw "Igby Goes Down" last night at the local movie theater -- for a 6-screen theater it's not bad, but it doesn't seem to get the big general-audience movies, so I'm a little concerned about my future movie-going possibilities.  "Igby Goes Down" gets one thumb down and one thumb asleep.  I didn't get it.  Any of it.  It all blew right past me and I didn't care.  A very uncompelling movie experience.  Not recommended for any reason at all.  And the  urlLink Cranky Critic  agrees with me.  Tonight, I just finished my 9-page first-year-lawyering memo on the enforceability of covenants not to compete for legal recruiters in New Jersey.  Brutal.  But it's not due until Friday and I finished it, so I can't complain too much.  And tomorrow is another day.

      Brief history just to set something up: after graduating from Princeton in June 2000, I went to work in the marketing department at Trilogy, a software company in Austin, TX.  I decided to leave Trilogy in January 2002, once I figured out I was coming here in the fall, basically to give myself some time to write and see if I could make anything happen by searching for writing opportunities and pursuing them unencumbered by a full-time job for 8 months.  So one of the things I worked on was I wrote the music for a musical -- I found the librettist (book writer) on a website with postings for collaborators, and he and I and the lyricist he foudn collaborated over the Internet and wrote a musical.  Eventually, in July I flew down to Raleigh, NC, where the librettist lived, to record a demo CD of the songs, but until then, the three of us hadn't met.  He's now shopping the show to a bunch of theaters around the country hoping to get someone interested.  It would be very cool if something happened, but I'm not holding my breath.  To make this relevant -- somehow he convinced the theater critic of the Detroit Free Press newspaper to write an article about our Internet collaboration and the novelty of it.  It came out in today's paper.  So I'm in the newspaper!  Check it out!   urlLink Detroit Free Press article -- check it out!    I said  urlLink check it out!     urlLink I mean it!

      A Song Lyric About the Socratic Method of Teaching  It was early Monday morning I was sitting in my class The teacher has her seating chart ...and we're not allowed to pass  I sink down a little lower And pretend that I'm not there I look into my laptop screen  ...start my game of solitaire  And she's calling on my neighbor And he gets the answer wrong Where's my casebook, am I ready, must stay strong  Chorus -- (Don't call on me) I did not read the case (Don't call on me) I'm trying to hide the blank look on my face I've been staring into space... Don't call on me  She insults the guy with dandruff She dismisses Mr. Yale She says anyone who's not prepared Will fail.  She goes up and down the aisles Sees me win my pinball game Goes back to check her seating chart Please don't look at my name  And she's got all of this power And this look that's in her eyes She's just waiting for when your name's a surprise  Chorus -- (Don't call on me) I did not read the case (Don't call on me) I'm trying to hide the blank look on my face I've been staring into space... Don't call on me  Bridge -- And the guy who went to Stanford Again has peed his pants And the girl who's formed a study group Has breast implants But that's not really relevant  Chorus -- (Don't call on me) I did not read the case (Don't call on me) I'm trying to hide the blank look on my face I've been staring into space... (Don't call on me) You're gonna make me cry (Don't call on me) I'll kiss my pride goodbye I am here in law school why? Don't call on me Please Don't call on me

      Just got back from Fenway Park, where I saw the Red Sox beat the Devil Rays 6-1 in the rain.  Light rain.  Not too bad.  Fenway Park is excellent.  Nice and cozy.  My seat was in the bleachers, which couldn't have been more than half as far as the outfield seats in Camden Yards.  In the 6th inning, we moved over to seats right behind home plate -- 4th row -- which was pretty cool.  Could practically touch the players.  The seats seem much closer to the field than at Shea Stadium or anywhere else I've been.  I definitely want to go see some more games in the Spring.  A few random notes on Fenway -- at one food stand they serve a "steak tips" sandwich and a "turkey tips" sandwich.  What exactly is a turkey tip?  Where is the tip of the turkey?  Is it the beak?  The feet?  I'm just not sure.  Also, there's a big milk advertisement on the foul pole -- a big plastic container of Hood's milk, which reads, on the container, "New Light-Blocking Container."  That's their big new thing -- I've seen the commercials too.  It keeps light out so the milk stays fresher.  And, of course, the container is all lit up, glowing brightly in the night.  Uh, I thought it was light-proof.  Completely unrelated to Fenway, but has been on my mind for a while and got a good reaction in conversation today, so I figure I'll share -- since I got here, I've been finding that lots of people here studied at Oxford.  It probably seems like more than it actually is -- but just because they all seem to bring it up in every conversation.  No matter what the conversation is about, it seems like if someone went to Oxford, they're going to find a way to say it.  Twice.  "Look at that tree!"  "Ah, yes.  It reminds me of the trees we used to have at Oxford."  "It rained like this at Oxford."  "I ate a turkey sandwich once at Oxford."  "Someone wore a hat like that at Oxford."  "That flower reminds of me of something in the gardens at Oxford."  "The sky was blue at Oxford."  "We breathed air at Oxford."  "Objects were made of atoms and molecules at Oxford."  And so on.  This one guy -- who will of course remain nameless -- I've had perhaps five conversations with him.  And in each one, he's found a way to remind me that he went to Oxford.  I was at a meeting with him where we all had to go around and introduce ourselves -- "say your name and one fact about you" -- like I even need to write the rest of the sentence, right?  Figure it out.  It's not that hard.  :)

      Had to go to the undergraduate library this morning to find a book for the subciting I have to do for the Journal on Law and Technology.  (A brief description of subciting, for the non-law students in the audience -- it's basically checking footnotes in journal articles to make sure they're accurate and formatted properly, based on a 386-page "pamphlet" called the Bluebook.  And, yes, it's as boring as it sounds.)  So I went to Widener Library.  I think it's called Widener because every time they wanted to add books, they just said "Widen 'er."  Yeah, not funny, I know.  Anyway, this library is huge, and harder to navigate than the streets of a South American country during a soccer championship.  Yeah, that's not funny either.  So... back to the library... there's an East wing and a West wing, and they're only connected on some floors, and at some narrow passageway in the middle of the library.  I asked the librarian how to get from 1-East to 1-West, and she said, "Go through the doors, and make a right.  Follow the stacks and then make a right.  Go through the door, past the copier, and make a right.  Then go past the bathrooms and make a right.  Go by the refueling station and make another right.  Then follow the signs towards China (I mean "Chinese language and literature"), take off your shoes, go down the slide, under the ropes, make three more rights, and it'll be behind door #3.  There's only a copy machine on every other floor.  I found a staircase, went up, and was greeted with a sign, "this is not a staircase."  Uh, sure it is.  Just without a door at the top.  Finally I found what I was looking for.  Well, sort of.  I found 2 of the 3 books I needed to find.  The third one is at the Harvard Book Depository, which I think is where President Kennedy was shot.  I have to fill out a book release form for it, so they can send someone to the warehouse to get it out of cold storage (next to Ted Wlliams' body) and let me look at it for 4 hours in special reserves on floor B-9 -- that's the 9th floor underground, right above the fifth ring of hell.  Yes, so that was my adventure in the undergraduate library.  Makes me wish I was an undergrad.  Not.

      I went to a panel on Sports Law this evening.  3 attorneys from a firm called Proskauer Rose talking about sports law -- apparently they represent Major League Baseball, the NBA, a bunch of players and teams, David Stern (NBA commish) and Gary Bettman (NHL commish) used to work for them, they do MLB arbitration for the Marlins, Royals, and Expos, they did the owners' side for the MLB strike-avoiding settlement... all sorts of cool stuff....  So HOW did the attorneys on the panel make it all sound so BORING?  They were so dull, so unenergetic, talking about how really sports law is just another kind of labor law, and uninteresting blah blah blah.  They actually made their jobs sound dismal and horrid.  And if it's dismal and horrid doing sports law, then imagine non-sports corporate law.  AHHH!!!

      Not sure if I've mentioned in the weblog yet -- I'm writing a weekly column for the law school newspaper about life as a 1L.  Trying to be even funnier than the weblog, where I don't do rewrites and I'm not expected to produce something with a beginning, middle, and an end.  I have an idea for next week's column regarding advice that 2Ls and 3Ls give to us lowly first-years.  I did an entry sort of talking about this last week, after the Environmental Law Review's "study tips panel."  But that was more of a rambling list.  I want the column to hang together better, maybe even to actually have a point.  Let's try a quick first draft... postscript: [It needs work.  I'm not that happy with it.  But it'll do for now.]  Thank You For Your Contradictory Advice  A room full of 1Ls, and the conversation is fairly predictable.  Six basic questions.  "What's your name?" "What section are you in?" "Where are you from?" "Where'd you go to school?" "How long ago did you graduate?" and "Which of the twenty-five pre-approved corporate law firms do you one day hope to work for?"  Okay, maybe not the last question.  But it's probably coming soon.  Nevertheless, the conversations all seem to start out with those same basic questions.  Put a 2L or a 3L in the room, however, and the Earth begins to spin in a completely different direction.  Invariably, it seems like within forty-five seconds, the upperclassman will be holding court, being pelted with questions and urged to share his or her infinite wisdom and advice with us lowly first-years.  In case you haven't yet found yourself in one of these conversations, here's the advice you're missing:  Brief the cases.  Don't brief the cases.  Go to class.  If you want.  Your grades are very important.  Your grades have nothing to do with how well you know the material.  Your grades are completely random and unpredictable.  Everyone gets B's, even people who say they got A's. Grading is blind.  No, it's not.  Gilbert's, Emanuel's, Nutshells, Hornbooks, Restatements, Treatises, Outlines, Flash Cards, Review Tapes, Bar-Bri Classes, Private Tutors, Rent-a-2L, Bribe Professors, Crime of Passion, Transfer to Jupiter, The answer is always "C," Read Glannon for Civ Pro.  Maybe the most confusing advice I've gotten is regarding study groups.  I've heard everything from, "I had a study group first-year, and we met every day of the semester from midnight until 4 a.m. going over the day's reading and taking sample exams.  Except we took one day off for Thanksgiving.  And did a conference call instead," to "At about 11 at night the day before my first exam, I ran into this guy at 7-11 in Harvard Square.  He kind of looked familiar, but I'm not really sure if he was in my section, or a panhandler.  I asked him if he understood section 2-718 of the Uniform Commercial Code and he kind of shook his head.  That was pretty much my only time trying a study group."  (Of course, after trying this paragraph out in conversation the other day, just to see if it could get a laugh or if I should just toss it, I got a reply, with all seriousness, "I think the best strategy may fall somewhere inbetween those two."  You really think so?)  I think I was most disturbed by a piece of advice I got from a particularly hard-core upperclassman.  "Just remember, you're not here to make friends.  You're here to get a job."  Actually, I have two issues with that statement.  The first is fairly easy to dispose of.  I'm not "here to get a job."  I'm here NOT to get a job!  If I really wanted to get a job, I wouldn't be here.  I'd have a job.  I'm here to hide from that for three more years!    My second issue with the advice is that the two statements don't seem mutually exclusive to me.  Unless the job you're here to get is kicking babies and tripping the elderly (and I believe that since that isn't a corporate firm job, it would count as public interest work under the LIPP program, yes?), I don't see why you can't be here to make friends too.  I'm totally here to make friends.  I can't think of a more dismal outcome to three years here than to leave and not have made a corporate jet-load of friends.  Actually, that's not true.  I can think of three more dismal outcomes: (1) flunking out, (2) felony-murder, and (3) interest rates on student loans rise to 400% compounded daily.  But not making any friends is close to the top of the list.  Worst of all about getting advice from 2Ls and 3Ls is that the advice never comes with the right disclaimers.  You never hear, "don't brief your cases.  I didn't, and I got all D's," or "you don't need to make your own outlines.  I used ones I found on the ground in front of CVS.  And this is my fourteenth year as a student here."  I gave myself some advice the other day about listening to other people's advice.  I don't.  I nod, and smile, and occasionally say "uh huh," or "sure," or "replevin," but I'm not really listening.  Instead, I'm collecting cans for the five cent deposit so I can earn enough money to buy every hornbook in the Coop.  Because the guy in 7-11 said that was a good idea.

      Apparently an incoming Harvard Law student won the Miss America pageant the other night.  I heard that for the first time, they had a "knowledge quiz" as part of the competition.  The highest score was 12 of 16 correct.  If you didn't see the pageant either, you can imagine with me that these were the questions (keep in mind they were multiple choice):  1. What's your name? 2. Spell the first word in the title of the movie "A Beautiful Mind." 3. Name a word that rhymes with "gymsuit" and starts with the sound "sw." 4. Name one President.  (Hint: the current President is George Bush) 5. If you're happy and you know it, clap your hands. 6. What's your name again? 7. What's 1+1? 8. Count to ten, starting with the number 10. 9. What day of the year do we traditionally celebrate New Year's Day? 10. If today is Monday, what day of the week is today? 11. Name one TV channel, by number. 12. Put your left foot in. 13. Take your left foot out. 14. Put your left foot in. 15. And shake it all about. 16. Do the hokey pokey, and turn yourself around, and that's what it's all about.

      Got into the a capella group I auditioned for, and got a chorus part in the Gilbert and Sullivan musical -- "Trial By Jury" -- that I auditioned for.  Good that these activities exist.  A little worried I'm biting off more than I can handle.  But no problems yet.  I'll wait and see how my schedule looks once things have actual meeting times.  I took my mess of Microsoft Word class notes and turned them into the beginnings of neat and organized course outlines.  Here's the before and after:   BEFORE   Contracts notes for Sept. 18 ----- professor says contracts are good.... student in third row wearing green shirt says no..... contracts are always enforceable ---- never --- sometimes.... maybe... **this is very important** page 143, second paragraph from the middle.  Justice Rehnquist on contracts.....  tomorrow we will continue and look at the next case... bring the supplementary textbook....   AFTER   I. Contracts are good ---A. No --------1. Enforceable ------------a. Green shirt ----------------i. Justice Rehnquist --------------------(a) tomorrow  See?  Much better!

      Idea for an offensive comedy sketch -- male bulimics.  Lights up on a men's bathroom.  Retching and vomiting noises.  One stall opens and this big wrestler dude comes out.  Next stall door opens, a football player comes out, wiping his mouth.  And so on.  I don't why I think this is funny.  Maybe just because the mental image of bulimics are these wafer-thin girls forcing themselves to vomit and you don't really think of guys as being bulimic.  Frankly, I don't understand bulimia.  Anorexia I kind of understand.  I want to be thin, so I'll stop eating.  Messed up, but at least there's some logic there.  But "I want to be thin, so I'll eat everything I can and then vomit it all up?"  Doesn't make sense to me.  Why does anyone want to purposely vomit?  It's disgusting to vomit when it's not on purpose -- how much more disgusting must it be when you're making yourself do it?  I just don't get it.  On the topic of bodily functions, this actually reminds me -- there's a USA Today editorial in yesterday's paper written by Al Neuharth, the Founder (and I think still the publisher) of USA Today.     urlLink Click here to read this USA Today article, but don't forget to come back   It's about how he wears adult diapers.  Seriously.  He says it outright, I'm not just making an inference and leaping to conclusions.  I have to wonder why he felt compelled to reveal this in USA Today.  Aside from the fact that most USA Today readers are still in children's diapers, I just don't get it.  It's too much information.  Like finding out someone has lice, or warts, or a yeast infection.  I just don't need to know.  Especially not about the founder of USA Today.  I don't care if he wears adult diapers.  And I don't know why he wants to tell the world.

      Someone told me the library is giving out free spill-proof mugs.  And that they're enormous.  Second only to the size of the Library of Congress spill-proof mugs...   I got a callback for the a capella group.  Sunday night they get to see if I can blend.  I'm going to a party tonight near Central Square, which apparently quite a hike.  But that's okay, the exercise'll be good for me.  Nothing else really to say tonight... maybe more after the party...

      Last night I auditioned for the law school's production of "Trial by Jury," a Gilbert and Sullivan musical.  I'm not by any means confident that I'll get cast -- but I figured the audition would at least be fun and maybe I'd meet some people into theater and music and stuff like that.  If I don't get cast I might volunteer if they need any tech people -- lighting, sound, etc.  In fact, that kind of sounds like more fun than performing Gilbert and Sullivan on stage.  I'm a writer inside.  Not an actor.  So not getting cast won't kill me.  I also auditioned for the law school's a capella singing group, Scales of Justice.  I auditioned at Princeton for a bunch of a capella groups and never got in.  But maybe the competition's less fierce here.  Again, no expectations that I'll get in, but I figured why not try it.  I'd probably like to get into this more than I would the Gilbert and Sullivan musical, but I'm perfectly prepared to make it into neither.  I know, this entry isn't funny yet.  It's coming.  As I continued on the "Join My Organization" Express Train (TM) this week, I attended a meeting this evening for RAP, the Recording Artists' Project.  They give legal advice to musicians who can't afford to pay for it.  Sounds pretty cool.  And they gave out free cookies.  Later on tonight I have subciting training for JOLT, the Journal of Law and Technology.  (Then I'll take a NAP, the Nocturnal Anti-awake Protocol -- enough with the acronyms!!)  RAP had cookies.  JOLT promises food of some non-pizza variety.  Together they'll make dinner.  Anyone here who's worried about cooking simply isn't joining enough organizations.  I could eat six meals and still have meetings left to attend.  Of course, then I'll need to join the Soccer Club and the Ultimate Frisbee Team to burn off all of the calories.  Every organization says the same thing -- "you can get involved for as much or as little as you want."  I just want the food.  I don't know.

      I've got a free bouncing flashing ball from Lexis-Nexis.  You bounce it, it flashes.  Very useful for alerting people you're in danger, or frightening young children.  It's an incentive to sign up for their bar review course.  Seems a little early -- like, say, three years early -- to be thinking about taking the bar exam, but I guess there's lots of competition for bar review course providers.  They had all sorts of information about how if you sign up now you get free end-of-the-year tutoring sessions for exams, and stuff like that.  Not that interested, really.  Just too soon to be worrying about the bar exam.  Although I appreciate the ball.  This afternoon we have the student organizations fair in the Ropes-Gray room.  Could they name that room after two less fun sounding people?  I think of ropes and gray and I think of being on line in the post office.  Waiting for a bank teller.  Visiting someone in jail.  Ropes.  Gray.  How about the Handcuffs-Drizzle room?  Should we hold the carnival in there?  Or the Trapped-Lightning auditorium.  Let's turn it into a dance club.  Why couldn't they pair Ropes and Gray with different people to create more pleasant room name combinations?  Ropes-Carousel has a nice sound to it -- makes me think of a theme park.  The Gray-Hound room could be the travel office.  Gray-Zing could be the barn.  I don't know.  "Ropes" is a tough one for a room name, actually.  It conjures up waiting in line.  One of those turnstile lines, zig-zagging back and forth and back and forth.  It doesn't help that registration was in the Ropes-Gray room, and that basically was just a whole line-waiting extravaganza.  It reminds me of a South Park episode I saw once, where they're at an amusement park and there's a "Line Ride," where you wait on line, get to the end, and then you're done.  "Thanks for riding the line ride."  Acceptable for a cartoon, sure.  But not acceptable at law school.  I want the student organizations fair to be in the Enjoyable-Diversions room.  Or the Time-Filler corridor.  Or even the Fail-Gracefully amphitheater.  But Ropes-Gray?  Come on.  They can do better than that...

      I just went to a "study tips" panel as part of a journal's introductory meeting.  No disrespect intended to the second- and third- years on the panel -- because it was all well-intentioned and there was nothing "wrong" with the advice... it just wasn't very useful.  Expanding on that theme, a brief rundown of all of the things I've been told will make the first year of law school a success (and, no, this is not going to be yet another comedy sketch disguised as a weblog entry):  Read the cases once. Read the cases twice. Don't read the cases. Re-read the cases before class.  Re-read the cases after class.  Re-read the cases during class.  Write briefs.  Brief in the book.  Keep your briefs short.  Make your briefs long. Don't rely on your briefs. Your briefs can be useful.  Take lots of notes. Don't take too many notes. Don't take any notes at all. Get outlines from upperclassmen. Write your own outlines.  Buy commercial outlines. Join a study group. Start a study group. Study groups are great. Study groups are useless. Join your group early and meet every week. Wait until the week before exams. Study in your room. Study in the library.  Study in the morning. Study at night. Study in the bathroom. Study with the TV on. Study in silence. Study in the dark. Study in your sleep. Don't study.  Grades don't matter. Grades are arbitrary. Grades are meaningless. Grades control your future. Raise your hand in class. Never raise your hand. Cut off your hand. Go to your professor's office hours. Have lunch with your professor. Shine your professor's shoes.  Do your professor's laundry. Ignore everything your professor says.  Read hornbooks. Read treatises. Read restatements of the law. Read the exam answers off your neighbor's screen.  Read quickly. Read slowly. Sleep a lot. Sleep a little. Binge. Purge. Starve. Pay your bills. Join activities. Don't join anything. Have fun. Do work. Make friends. Everyone's your enemy. Be prepared. Stop, drop and roll. Say no, go, and tell someone you trust. Only you can prevent forest fires. A watched pot never boils. One in the hand is worth two in the bush. Save your money. Save your soul. Read the cases. Read the exam carefully. Read your professor's mind. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. Set your alarm clock. Don't forget chapter three. The correct answer is (c). Save the whales. Let's make a deal. Leave it to Beaver. Say no to drugs. Play ball!

      Tried to mail a small package -- really it's just a padded envelope with a CD and some papers -- today.  Sounds easy, right?  Well, the nearest post office is in Harvard Square, about a 10 minute walk --no big deal, but I didn't really want to walk 10 minutes.  So I went to the Harvard mail room.  Surely they'd be able to tell me how much my package weighed, right?  I wasn't even going to ask them to let me buy the stamps from them, or ask them to toss it in the mail for me -- although those both seem like reasonable things that might be possible in a mail room.  All I wanted to know was what the package weighed.  Me: Excuse me?  I have a little package I want to mail, but I'm not sure how much it weighs.  I was hoping you might have a scale and be able to tell me how much postage I need to put on it. Woman: Oh.  I don't do that.  Try Room 4.  They have a pretty good scale. Me: Thanks. (I walk to Room 4) Me: Excuse me?  I have a little package I want to mail, but I'm not sure how much it weighs.  The woman down the hall told me you might have a scale and be able to tell me how much postage I need to put on my package. Man: I don't do that. Me: What do you mean? Man: We don't do that. Me: Don't do what?  Can't you just tell me what this weighs? Man: I have a scale, but we really don't do that. Me: I see the scale.  It's right over there.  Can't you just weigh this for me and tell me how many ounces? Man: Aw, just give me the package and I'll see what I can do. (I hand him the package.  He takes 4 steps to the scale and weighs the package.) Man: It's about 3 ounces, basically. Me: More than 3 ounces, or less than 3? Man: I don't know.  It's less than a half a pound. Me: Yeah, I know. Man: So it's about 3 ounces. Me: Great. Thanks. (he hands me back the package) Man: Don't ask me how much postage that is though.  I don't know.  It's a bunch of stamps. Me: Yeah, I'll just look it up I guess.  Thanks. Man: Sure. [Sigh]

      I got the world's fastest haircut this afternoon.  I was in the barber's chair for 6 minutes.  Amazing.  He was earning $150 an hour if he could keep that chair filled.  Today's Yom Kippur. I'm not fasting, but I don't think I've eaten any pork or shellfish products today -- yeah, I think the crab in the California Roll I had for lunch was just that imitation crab stuff -- so at least it's a step in the right direction.  They taped the classes today so people who missed them for the holiday can listen to them later.  Imagine trying to make sense of an audiotape of class, with the Socratic method and everything... doesn't sound like much fun....

      Harvard Square's kind of nice.  Lots of stores.  Lots of activity.  Lots of choices.  Lots of little streets to turn down.  But, to continue with the rhetorical device, lots of people asking for change.  And -- as opposed to the taxi drivers -- they're more aggressive than their counterparts in New York.  They try to make conversation, they stand in the middle of the sidewalk, they follow you, they plead, they make eye contact.  They're persistent.  It's kind of interesting, actually.  Because they don't seem dangerous, and there are lots of people around so it's not like it feels like a safety threat or anything, but it's just a little surprising that this is where they flourish.  In Cambridge, Massachusetts, right outside the Harvard University campus.  Just seems a little odd and cognitively dissonant to me.  But the real point of this is that I want to write a little sketch about it.  So here goes.  "Completely Invented Interview With A Guy Asking For Change In Harvard Square"  Guy Asking For Change In Harvard Square: Nice khaki pants, man.  Spare some change? Me: Sorry.  No change. Change Guy: That's okay.  I take bills too. Me: That's funny.  Tell you what.  I'll give you a dollar if you'll answer a few questions. Change Guy: Two dollars.  And not those weird Sacajawea coins. Me: Okay, deal. Change Guy: Okay. Me: So how'd you end up on the street? Change Guy: Orgo. Me: Orgo? Change Guy: Yeah. Organic Chemistry.  I was a student at Harvard, class of '77.  Wanted to be a doctor.  Took organic chemistry.  Flunked it. Me: This was before grade inflation. Change Guy: Yeah.  So I flunked it and had to drop out.  And I needed some quick cash to start paying back the student loans. Me: Cause the late '70s and interest rates were so high. Change Guy: Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I voted for Carter, but those interest rates were totally not what I needed at that point. Me: Okay, so you flunked out and needed the cash.  Why begging? Change Guy: Couldn't get hired at the Gap. Me: Gotcha.  And you've been here ever since? Change Guy: Actually I tried New Haven for a couple of years but I kept getting mugged. Me: Understood.  So how much do you usually pull in a day? Change Guy: About three hundred bucks if I work a full eight hours. Me: Three hundred bucks?  That's incredible! Change Guy: Yeah, my wife thinks so too. Me: You're married? Change Guy: Yeah.  And we live just up Mt. Auburn Street.  My wife's a dental hygienist. Me: What? Then why are you still on the street? Change Guy: Well, like I just said, it's lucrative.  And it's creative.  You know, coming up with new ways to get people to give me money. It's kind of fun, it keeps me sharp.  Plus I get to be close to my son. Me: Your son? Change Guy: Yeah, he's a sophomore at Harvard.  Economics major.  He's real smart.  Stops by to say hi a couple of times a day, we usually have lunch together. Me: Where do you eat? Change Guy: Well usually he just brings me his leftovers from the dining hall.  Gotta save on the expenses here.  Every quarter counts.  Especially those state ones.  That's one of the big perks doing this actually.  I see the new state quarters usually the day they come out. I've got a whole book of 'em, I'm a collector. Me: Cool.  What do you notice most about Harvard students? Change Guy: The conversations I overhear.  Can always tell who's a Harvard student.  They're always throwing those 10-letter words into the conversation.  Words like "privileged,"gentrified," and "epiglottis."  Sometimes makes me sick.  Well, that or the smell coming from Au Bon Pain.  Not sure which. Me: One last question.  What's the future hold for you?  You want to be here in Harvard Square forever, or you have plans to move ahead? Change Guy: Well, I've enjoyed my time here.  I really have.  But actually this is my last semester in the Square.  I took the GMAT a couple of weeks ago and scored pretty well -- and I'm starting at the business school next fall.  Hopefully start up a technology company of some sort.  Make a "change."  Get it?  Change?  Cause I ask for change?  It's a pun. Me: Yeah, I got it.  Well it was nice talking to you.  Here's your two bucks.  Have a nice day. Change Guy: Thanks.  Maybe I'll see you around -- I'm thinking about auditing a couple of law school classes.

      I went somewhere and got a sandwich for lunch.  The woman behind the counter was wearing a pair of plastic gloves while she made the sandwich.  She wraps the sandwich up.  She comes over to the register to take my money.  She takes my $10, gives me back my change.  Still wearing the gloves.  Isn't the point of the gloves so that what touches dirty stuff like money doesn't touch the food?  Why bother wearing gloves if you're gonna get them dirty?  Right?  And doesn't it sound dirtier to make a sandwich wearing dirty gloves than with dirty hands?  I mean, it's probablty the same either way, but something feels even less sanitary about dirty plastic gloves than dirty skin.  I don't know.  The sandwich was good, and I'm still alive, so I guess no big deal.  But still...

      Tripling up on the entries today to make up for yesterday.  Actually no, it's because I have stuff I want to write.  I crashed the Federalist BBQ for lunch today to get free food -- a wise decision (hot dogs were good, the cookies were Great), but I think I may have been a bit too forthcoming as far as my motives.  I saw someone from my section and whispered -- 'I'm not really a Federalist, I'm just here for the food' and he gave me a look that didn't seem too welcoming.  I tried to cover with a line like "well the Federalists believe in giving power to the states... so why not hamburgers to the hungry..." but that didn't fly.  And then I was talking to someone and it came up that I spent a summer in Washington interning for Senator... uh... Schumer.  I wanted to swallow that one back when it came out.  Ha.  In my defense, I'm probably closer to being a federalist than, say, a socialist, so it's not like I'm some commie liberal spy.  I would be willing, however, to bet that the food here was better than it would be at the Human Rights Association barbeque (or, more definitely, the ANIMAL Rights Association barbeque -- "Would you like some ketchup on that empty bun?  How about some celery?")

      Apologies for no entry Friday.  But it's hardly past midnight Saturday morning, so hopefully you'll forgive me.  I just got back from the 1L Boat Cruise in Boston Harbor.  Like every other evening social event, it was crowded, noisy, and dark.  But this was better than the Bar Reviews.  Writing stuff down after midnight, for me, usually produces something a little more introspective and revealing than I'll let myself put on paper during normal business hours.  So, given the time, against my better judgment, I'm letting myself write the following poem.  Usually my feelings come out in song lyric form, but this one's definitely a poem.  I'm sick of superficial conversations About the weather and the scenery and the food I'd like to roll my eyes and scream "enough!" But I'm afraid that it would come out rude  It's not important where you're from, no really A city is a city, they're the same And maybe if I say it one more time now You'll finally remember what's my name  It feels like there's a padlock on your spirit A wall that's blocking visions in your soul I want to know just what you're really feeling Instead of listening to you play a role  I'll tolerate if you have something witty A line that you've been practicing all day But let me know there's something more beneath it A person deep inside the words you say  I only want to make that one connection To find someone who understands my brain An ally, just a friend to whisper thoughts to To keep me from a journey towards insane  I know there's something more than what I'm getting There must be real emotions that want out I'm waiting, listening, pleading, give me something Cause isn't this what life is all about?  I'm tired of the same old bunch of questions With answers that you'll anyway forget I'm sick of superficial conversations But that's the only kind I seem to get.

      If you've been a faithful reader, you may recall that occasionally I'll stick a phrase in quotes and mention that I'll likely come back to that theme at some point -- recall "Interesting Jobs That Lawyers Have" -- but as of yet haven't.  Well, here's another first in a series that may only be one installment long.  I'll call it a "Cambridge Travelogue," only because I can't think of a wittier name that still indicates what I'm talking about.  Today's "Cambridge Travelogue" will focus on "North of the Law School."  Heading north of the law school I've found to be generally easier to deal with than heading South, because really there's only one street to head North on (Massachusetts Avenue) and it's really hard to get lost.  Heading South into Harvard Square presents all sorts of problems involving underpasses, diagonal streets, locked gates, disorienting 5-way intersections, and a general lack of street signs.  But heading North on Massachusetts Avenue presents none of those problems.  It's hard to get lost walking up and down a 4-lane road with a big concrete median in the middle (is "median in the middle" redundant?  Or perhaps it's the name of a TV show on Fox).  Heading North one encounters a wide variety of restaurants and shops, none of which I've visited.  One of the first things you pass when heading north (I'll stop capitalizing "north" now because it looks weird) is a Starbucks.  When you see the Starbucks, it's reassuring, because you know you must be in civilization and you haven't accidentally wandered off into the woods.  The unique flavor of Boston is reflected in ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about the Starbucks, which of course is a carbon-copy of every other Starbucks in the world.  A few blocks north of the Starbucks are some ethnic restaurants -- Mexican, Indian, Korean -- that may or may not be good. A few more blocks and you arrive at the Porter Square Exchange, a small shopping mall with a particular focus on Asian food.  It's actually quite interesting and unique -- there's an low-priced Asian food court I tried once (the noodles with seaweed were good... I didn't have my glasses so I couldn't read all of the menu, but squinting I saw noodles and seaweed and figured that sounded safe), a Japanese supermarket with all sorts of interesting (and cheap) food items, along with sushi-grade fish, a stand that sells bubble tea (good stuff -- see weblog entry from about a week ago -- although after just three trips there I'm kind of sick of it, which may indicate the novelty has worn off), and the world's smallest Barnes and Noble bookstore, which is really the Lesley University bookstore run by Barnes and Noble, complete with perhaps 5% of the selection of a normal Barnes and Noble (or the super-duper Harvard Coop in Harvard Square that's also obviously a Barnes and Noble, with what looks like a great selection) as well as Lesley University paraphenalia (the official colors of Lesley University are lavender and teal -- no, they're not, but imagine if they were!).  Further north is the Porter Square shopping center, with a hardware store, a big Star supermarket -- with these awesome self-checkout stations I'd never seen before.  You scan your own stuff and bag it and are outta there in a jiffy -- it's way cool -- and some other stores I can't remember.  Further north are the woods.  Maybe.  I don't know.  That's as far north as I've gotten.  In the next "Cambridge Travelogue," whenever that might be -- we head south towards Harvard Square, get lost, and have to buy a map to find our way back (don't laugh).

      I need to do laundry.  First I need to buy laundry-doing supplies, like detergent.  This is going to be a significant barrier to the laundry ever getting done.  I'm ashamed to admit that twice in college, when I didn't want to do laundry, I went out and bought a few pairs of socks, just so I could wait a few more days.  If I had any clue where to buy socks near here -- that is, cheap socks that don't say Harvard on them, because those I'm sure I could find -- I'd be tempted to do the same.  But I think I have 2 more days before laundry really gets desperate, so I think I'll push it off until at least tomorrow and perhaps Friday.  I've gotten into a pre-bedtime routine the last 3 nights where I've been watching a Golden Girls rerun on Lifetime at 11:30.  It does old up well to the test of time -- there was a Gary Hart joke last night that I'm not certain I fully got -- but Lifetime really needs to change their slogan.  Every time they say "You're watching Lifetime.  Television for women."  I feel like I shouldn't be watching.  Like there couldn't be anything more pathetic than watching this.  Even though it's 11:30 at night and it's not like I should be doing anything else.  But that slogan completely turns me off.  They're alienating half their potential audience.  It's really stupid, if you ask me.  "You're watching Lifetime.  Television for women."  Like if I wrote "You're reading my weblog.  Reading material for my mom," I'd totally be alienating half my audience.  :)  So I won't say that.  Anymore.

      Today we had a university-wide moment of silence at 9:40.  Normally on Wednesday I have a class from 8:30-9:40.  But yesterday she told us she wanted to move it back ten minutes to 8:20-9:30 so we're not interrupted by the moment of silence.  It made sense when she said it, but when I got up ten minutes earlier to get to class, it didn't make sense anymore.

      I went to the Office of Public Interest orientation meeting this evening -- very inspiring speech from a guy who works trying to get prisoners off of death row.  It was very much a "do what's in your heart, don't go work for law firms" message, which is a great message for them to be telling us, I think.  I was just surprised, honestly, how broad their definition of "public interest" is -- basically anything that isn't a corporate law firm, which is cool.  I can't really make fun of this presentation -- I thought it was really cool.

      Just got back from the "Journals Fair," where editors from each of Harvard's nine law journals stood up and gave a five-minute speech, trying to get people to join their journal.  Which was great, except they all gave... the SAME speech.  There is simply no way to distinguish the International Law Journal from the Human Rights Journal from the Journal on Legislation from the other six from their speeches alone.  No possible way.  All the speeches sounded like this:  Good evening.  I'm Law McLawyer, this year's assistant managing associate editor for the Harvard Journal on Cheese.  I know you've been sitting through a lot of speeches this evening, but I think you'll find this one is different because of the unique opportunities afforded by joining the Journal on Cheese -- opportunities that are identical to those offered by all of the other journals.    The Journal on Cheese is a relatively new journal.  We've been around for the same amount of time as all of the other journals.  We're also a relatively small journal, with roughly the same amount of people as all of the other journals.  We publish a series of articles in each of our issues, which come out a number of times throughout the year and are, if I may be so bold as to say, the longest journal issues on campus, approximately the same size as the issues of all of the other journals.    In each issue, we publish a wide variety of articles from law professors, judges, practitioners, janitors, and, yes, even students.  In fact, the Journal on Cheese distinguishes itself by its commitment to publishing student articles each year -- in exactly the same number as all of the other journals.  Last year, we published a fascinating article about the dried-up cheese on the outside of a bowl of French Onion soup written by a third-year student.  We have copies outside at our table if you're interested, along with some candy -- the same candy, in fact, as all of the other journals have at their tables.    The Journal on Cheese is really a fun organization to be a part of.  We're committed to being not just a sweatshop for first-year students desperate to pad their resume, but we also host a number of social events each year.  That number is one.  And the event is next week, when we will be hosting an open house to get you to sign up.  We'll be providing valuable, interesting, and interminable training sessions over the next few weeks so you can learn how to check citations on articles.  Which is of course the work you'll be doing, but in much lower amounts than any other journal would have you do, except if you actually count all of the minutes you'll spend on it.    We're also unique in that we allow first-years to come to our meetings and help us choose articles, just like all of the other journals.  First-years play an integral role in helping us say that we have first-years on our journal without having to lie.  In addition, from your work at the journal and your attendance at our meetings, there's the possibility of making one or two -- and even in a few rare cases, three -- friends.  Some of the best people I've met at Harvard, I've met because of the Journal on Cheese.    In closing, I think it's quite clear why the Journal on Cheese provides the best and most unique opportunities on campus, opportunities that are exactly the same as all of the other journals.  I hope you'll visit us at our table outside the lecture hall and sign up to receive reams of useless information about us and what we do.  Thank you for listening, and I hope to see you all at our open house, which we've conveniently scheduled at exactly the same time as all of the other open houses.

      I don't think I've yet given any direct advice about law school to anyone reading this who's going to go to law school sometime in the future.  Sure, there's all sorts of indirect advice and helpful incidental stuff you can pull from some of these entries, but I think this entry will be my first real piece of advice, and I'm totally serious about it.  A week too late, but I really am totally serious.  First a story to lead up to the advice, then the advice.  Don't skip ahead or you won't get the full impact.  So, for the past week, since classes started, I've been doing my work in my dorm room. Reading, outlining, whatever.  And going insane.  Because even though I'm making friends and I'm doing stuff, whenever I'm in my room I somehow feel like everyone else is out doing something interesting.  Or even something uninteresting.  But something.  And intellectually I know that's not the case, but emotionally I felt like being in my room was swallowing my soul.  Or something like that.  So this afternoon I decided to read in the library.  And after just a half hour, what a difference.  I didn't get as much done, but just the fact that there were all these other people around -- just the fact that I wasn't all alone in my room -- made all the difference in the world.  At least this afternoon it did.  Hence, my advice.  Get out of your room.  Go to the library.  You'll feel saner that way.

      Watched a video in First Year Lawyering class today about research tools at the library.  One source, according to the text superimposed on the screen, is "legal encyclopidias."  Their spelling, not mine.  If there's going to be one place in the universe where the word "encyclopedia" should be spelled correctly, shouldn't it be at Harvard's library?

      Overheard someone on his cell phone as I was walking through the law school campus:  "I'm really worried about Munich because I don't think the merger's gone through..."  Well, that sounds quite a bit more important than my last cell phone conversation, "...pepperoni, and a large cheesy bread."  (Okay, okay, my last cell phone conversation wasn't really ordering a pizza.  I haven't ordered a pizza on my cell phone ever I don't think, but it just sounded like the right punchline there, so I didn't want to let the joke fall by the wayside.  I know I shouldn't start inventing anecdotes, but the main part is real, I swear. Okay, it's almost real -- I changed the name of the city so on the off chance this person I don't know has stumbled onto my weblog, I won't have revealed secret merger information that he may get annoyed at.  But the rest is all true. Promise.)  I spent part of the day taking my class notes from the past week and separating the wheat from the chaff (is that a real phrase?  At first I wanted to say separating the curds from the whey, but I don't know which of those you save and which you toss, so I won't go with that).  That was just as much fun as it sounds.

      Last night I went to Rosh Hashana services at the Hillel here.  (This was a rare occasion for me -- I'm a pretty nonobservant Jew -- but I figured it would be a good way to meet people.)  The longest reform services ever.  Over two hours long.  At the end, they were talking about the next set of services, for Yom Kippur, the holiday we're supposed to fast.  The rabbi kept saying "fast."  "Before the fast," "after the fast," "breaking the fast."  Every time he said "fast," I looked at my watch and thought, "this isn't Fast.  It's excruciatingly slow.  Stop reminding me by saying 'fast' every ten seconds."    There was some cool stuff about the service though -- it was led by Harvard undergrads and they had a pretty fantastic student cantor who was better than most real cantors I've seen singing at services (although my breadth of experience is admittedly limited).  And I did meet a couple of people, so that was good.  I have a 2-page ungraded paper to write this weekend.  "2-page ungraded paper" certainly makes it sound fairly meaningles, doesn't it?  They should at least lie and say it's going to be graded, or posted for all to see, or something, anything, to make it feel like less of an exercise and more like a real assignment.    I get to try out the subway again today -- this time switching lines from Red to Green. Apparently the Green line is extra confusing.  If I don't post anything tomorrow by noon, send out a search party for me -- I'm probably wandering around downtown Boston unable to find where the subway lines meet....  I get bored way too easily.  I need to fix that before I start annoying the friends I'm making here with too many e-mails sounding too desperate about wanting to do something besides read about law.  Of course, I also need to read about law.  So I'm not sure where the balancing point it.  Still looking for it.  Today's bowl of Crispix was especially satisfying with the fresh milk I bought yesterday.  I'm really stretching for content now... must mean it's time to stop writing (and resume reading about law, and getting ready for my lunchtime subway adventure...).

      Lunch today at the cafeteria.  Got a bottle of Tropicana grapefruit juice.  Opened it, took a sip.  Tasted fine.  Noticed the date on the bottle -- "Jan 19 02."  Uh, that was 9 months ago.  Freaked me out.  Threw it away.  I was wrong to go against the Nantucket Nectars monopoly I guess....

      Thursday and Friday are my easy days. One class, 11:35-1:10. Civil Procedure.  It seems fairly inaccessible so far -- the history of the development of judicial procedure -- filing motions, collecting evidence, stuff like that.  Necessary stuff for courtroom law, but not the kind of stuff on Law and Order.  Or even on Court TV (actually, who knows... maybe there is a show on Court TV about civil procedure... I wouldn't know).

      First day of classes!  8:30 AM: Contracts.  The professor walks in, and immediately starts asking questions and calling on people off her seating chart.  Question!  Bam!  Question!  Bam!  Question!  Bam!  She was sharp, she was really sharp.  She should teach a "how to keep students awake" seminar to undergraduate professors.  Because no one was even thinking about anything besides contracts in that class.  It was like being on a quiz show, sort of, with 80 other people and no one knowing when it was going to be his or her turn, or what the subject of the question was going to be.  So it kept everyone, uh, on our toes.  But no disasters.  She got to probably 60 of the 80 people in the class with at least one question or another, and everyone's so concerned they'll be called on that no one remembers at the end who gave a good answer, who gave a bad answer, who did what.  It all just blends into an hour and a half long adrenaline rush.  They should conduct kindergarten the same way:  Lights up on a kindergarten classroom.  Maybe a dozen students all over the floor.  No teacher yet.  Students are drawing with crayons, playing with toys, whatever.  A teacher walks on, a little overdressed for the occasion.  She puts down her briefcase and pulls out some cards with big colored shapes on it.  She holds up a card with a blue triangle and points to one girl.  She talks fast.  the kids don't.  TEACHER: Ms. Smith, what color is this? (No response) TEACHER: Ms. Smith -- Sally -- what color is this? SALLY SMITH: Uh... TEACHER: Can anyone help out Ms. Smith? (One boy raises his hand) TEACHER: Mr. Johnson. BILLY JOHNSON: Blue. TEACHER: What shade of blue? BILLY JOHNSON: Huh? TEACHER:  You said blue.  I said what shade of blue? BILLY JOHNSON: Dark blue. TEACHER: Dark blue.  Okay.  How do we know it's dark? (No response) TEACHER: Ms. Rogers. BECKY ROGERS: What? TEACHER: How do we know it's dark? BECKY ROGERS: Dark blue? TEACHER: Yes, Mr. Johnson said that already.  It's dark blue.  How do we know? BECKY ROGERS: It looks dark. TEACHER: It LOOKS dark.  Okay.  How do you know? BECKY ROGERS: What? TEACHER: How do you know it looks dark to me?  Maybe it just looks dark to you.  How do you know?   BECKY ROGERS: I have to go to the bathroom. TEACHER: How do you know? (Billy Johnson raises his hand) TEACHER: Mr. Johnson. BILLY JOHNSON: It's dripping out of her skirt. TEACHER: Very good.  A fact.  Urine is dripping out of Ms. Rogers' skirt.  OBjective, not SUBjective.  Now what if it wasn't urine?  What if it was realy apple juice?  Mr. Sanchez? JOEY SANCHEZ: People don't pee apple juice. TEACHER: People don't pee apple juice.  All people? JOEY SANCHEZ: Yes. TEACHER: What about people you haven't met yet?  How do you know they don't pee apple juice?  What if some people did pee apple juice? JOEY SANCHEZ: Then they could go where people are starving and give them something to drink. TEACHER:  Interesting.  Now we're moving towards policy.  From facts to policy.  Very nice, Mr. Sanchez.  But back to the issue at hand.  Before Ms. Rogers peed on the floor, she said she knew this was dark blue because she saw it.  Is that compelling evidence?  What do you think, Ms. Jackson? (SARA JACKSON shrugs her shoulders.)  TEACHER: Use your words, Ms. Jackson.  Think back to the reading last night.  Is that compelling evidence? SARA JACKSON: See Spot run? TEACHER: No, we'll get to The State v. Spot in tomorrow's class.  Today we're focusing on the dark blue triangle.  Anyone know how we can prove this triangle is really the color that Mr. Johnson and Ms. Rogers are insisting it is? Mr. Phillips, if you could put the dump truck down for a moment and join us? DAVEY PHILLIPS: It's dark blue because we all think it's dark blue. TEACHER: Cultural convention. Interesting.  Now who can tell me about promissory estoppel and the interstate commerce clause? (Fade to black...)  The professor also mentioned not too many people have ever written songs about contracts.  I think I'm going to take that as a challenge.  Check back tomorrow for that one....

      I went on the subway -- I mean the "T" -- for the first time today.  Unlike New York subways, it's relatively clean, spacious, and temperature-controlled.  Unlike New York subways, no one was spilling food on fellow passengers, selling generic AA batteries, asking me to embrace the Lord, or making a big fuss over people leaning on the doors.  Unlike New York subways, the stations were well-lit, equipped with clean benches, and had platforms wide enough to allow even the largest Bostonian to pass without almost falling onto the tracks.  Unlike New York subways, the announcer clearly stated what the next stop was, the train did not stop for no apparent reason in the middle of the tunnels, and there was a security guard visible and awake.  Like New York subways, I'd still rather walk.

      I went to the Jewish bagel brunch today.  Good bagels.  Took some back with me.  Because they're free.  No stereotypes here.  Someone came over and asked if this was the Christian brunch.  I thought he was kidding.  He wasn't.  He left.  I'm a little bit addicted to Bubble Tea.  If you've never tried it, it's like iced tea with milk and balls of tapioca at the bottom which you suck up with a big straw.  Yeah, that sounds pretty vile.  But it's really good.  It's about a 10 minute walk away.  I've gone twice so far, once when I stumbled across the place when I was exploring, and then today as a little reading break.  So twice isn't too bad.  If it gets to be more than once or twice a week I'll seek professional help.  Speaking of the reading... it's not that bad... it's not the most thrilling stuff so far, but it's manageable.  I'm trying to read for the whole week -- and especially since I have only one class on Thursday and one on Friday, so my week is very front-loaded anyway.  Oddly enough, the Criminal Law reading is the least interesting of my subjects so far -- and you'd think that would be the most interesting.  On 60 Minutes, Andy Rooney did a thing about trains. He likes trains better than planes.  He also still uses a typewriter.  I typed up my schedule onto a little sheet of paper so I know where I have to be at any given time.  For whatever reason, Harvard's time slots aren't consistent across days.  Monday and Tuesday have the same slots for classes, and Thursday and Friday have the same slots as each other (but different from Monday and Tuesday), and Wednesday's different from all of them.  So I have classes that begin or end at the following times throughout the week: 8:30, 9:40, 10:00, 10:15, 11:10, 11:35, 11:55, 12:00, 12:30, 1:10, 1:20, 2:00, 2:50, 4:00, 4:20, and 6:00.  See where this can get a little confusing?  I was inspired to write a song the other day.  It's more introspective than funny, but if you're reading this far you're probably willing to indulge me.  It's not so much about how I feel, but it's taking an idea that crossed my mind and expanding on it in song lyric form.  E-mail me if you want the mp3.  :)  "You're Still You"  No one knows you No one can tell No one knows you No one knows you well You can be anything you want to be You can do anything you want to do But before you know it You're still you  Want to change it? Well here's your chance Want to change it? Take a brand new stance? Even though you try your best to make a change In your heart there's really not a lot to do Cause before you know it You're still know  (BRIDGE) You say no, this time's different Be the one who you dreamed you could be This time is different Live a life that you're longing to see This time's different You will do what you wish you could do And you won't be you anymore You won't be you  No one knows you 'Cept the reflection you see No one knows you Except you in your heart You can try, try as hard as you can try You can do all the things you want to do But in the end You're still you  And it's okay Cause I like you for you  (end song)

      An e-mail from my civil procedure professor last week:  "A brief note to those of you who are playing computer games during class.  I hope you're paying close enough attention to what's going on in the room that you occasionally fail to put a red nine on a black ten!"  A follow-up today:  "In my last e-mail, I tried to joke people out of playing computer games in class, but I guess that wasn't a complete success.  You have every right to be bored, of course, but I don't believe it's fair to those around you to try to relieve the boredom that way.  Give day-dreaming a chance."  Awesome. He's right that it's awfully distracting to see all the people around you playing solitaire, hearts, minesweeper -- or on rare occassions, even kung-fu fighting games, tetris-like block-falling games, and snood-like ball-shooting games.  Not that I'm totally innocent of all this -- I haven't yet resorted to playing games in class, but I sometimes start changing the color scheme of my screen, gratituously running the spell-check on my class notes, or playing with Word's autotext feature to make "sc" turn into supreme court automatically, "jur" into "jurisdiction," and, perhaps my biggest autotext triumph, having "oms" turn into "objective manifestation of subjective intent."  You wouldn't believe how often that comes in handy.  But I do (perhaps mistakenly) take the moral high ground since I don't play solitaire.  What's most distracting is when the guy or girl next to me wins and the cards fall down like springs across the screen.  Very hard not to be sucked in.  Mind-numbing...

      An ad in the mailboxes today for a tuxedo store... "over 20 HLS students served in this year only."  2 problems -- (1) don't they mean "this year alone?" and (2) there are over 1700 law students here.  The fact that 20 of them bought tuxedos from this place is decidedly unimpressive.  20 people here have probably been struck by lightning.  Run for Congress.  Contracted syphillis.  Seen Madonna's new movie.  (maybe not the last one)

      Our First Year Lawyering course -- abbreviated FYL -- is often a topic of conversational scorn.  It's a "legal skills" class -- how to do legal research, write memos, negotiate, conduct client meetings, etc -- and it's graded on a pass/fail basis (high pass / pass / low pass / fail, if I'm not mistaken), so it's basically just not as "real" as the other classes.  Plus it's taught by a lecturer, not a famous professor like the rest of the classes.  And apparently my section has more work than the other sections -- an extra memo, I guess -- but I think the fundamental complaint is that the class in general feels like busywork that takes time and energy away from the other classes, as opposed to feeling like valuable supplementary instruction.  Because writing a 10-page memo -- even though it's graded pass/fail -- still takes a lot of time and effort, because what's the difference between aiming for an A and aiming for a pass in actual performance?  Should I purposely spell words wrong because it's only graded pass/fail?  I imagine a solution to people's disgruntled-ness might be if they set it up as a real class -- didn't make it pass/fail, didn't act like it was any different from contracts or criminal law or civil procedure, and didn't give us reading targeted for a nine-year-old (we have a book called "finding the law" which basically tells us how to open books and turn pages, and we've had some excerpts from books about client interaction that say things like "it's important to listen and not to judge other people" -- yeah, because lawyers just lawyer and it's judges who judge).  Anyway, as I try to figure out if this is a good topic for my newspaper column next week, I've been trying to come up with some other (funny) things that FYL could stand for with regard to the class, besides First Year Lawyering.  So far:   F inding  Y our  L ibrary  F inishing  Y ou  L ast  F rustrating  Y our  L eisure  F eeble  Y oung  L ecturers? (that one's too harsh... but the F and Y are hard...)  I'm in search of more and better ones...

      On recommendation from a friend, I took a walk this afternoon (taking advantage of the really awesome weather) to a bakery that's in a completely different direction than anywhere I'd been so far, but only a 10-minute walk away.  (To put this in geographical terms, the main road -- Mass Ave -- runs North-South.  The two major places where food and stores are are Porter Square and Harvard Square, 10 minutes North and South, respectively.  Walking east takes me to Somerville, which looks like a part of town I ought to avoid although probably is perfectly safe.  This was west, where I hadn't ventured before)  So I found the bakery -- no small achievement given my utter lack of a sense of direction (I actually brought a map with me just in case -- that's how easily I get lost).  And I got a piece of Cranberry Pound Cake (and a cup of some herbal tea... I dunno, looked interesting, and was only a dollar.), and started to walk back.  So I reach into the bag to try a piece of the cake.  And it's ok, but there's a weird "extra" taste -- some flavor that didn't seem to belong.  Couldn't quite place it.  A few minutes later, the next bite.  Again, something extra -- not sweet, almost salty, kind of a robust flavor.  Third bite.  I figured it out.  The cake tasted like beef.  Like they accidentally dropped some roast beef in the batter.  Or they used meat drippings instead of milk as the liquid.  Very strange.  Like eating a "roast beef on cake" sandwich.  Not something I'd recommend.  Very strange.  Won't be going back there anytime soon....

      Went to a meeting last week -- motivated by the "free ice cream" -- of the Symposium committee for a journal I did some subciting for (reminder: that means footnote-checking).  They had about 8 of those haagen-dazs ice cream bars -- chocolate covered in chocolate, or vanilla covered in crunchy chocolate, or chocolate and vanilla covered in saturated fat and sprinkled with unsaturated fat.  8.  Which was enough for each person at the meeting to have 2.  Not a very well-attended meeting.  Which made me feel bad, since I was only there for the ice cream.  Now I feel obligated -- now that my name's on the list, and now that I've taken their free ice cream -- to actually get involved in this Symposium committee.  If only I had the foggiest notion of what a Symposium is...

      Game 7 of the World Series!  I'm rooting for the Angels... not sure why, but I'd rather they win than the Giants.  Maybe it's because if the Mets aren't going to win, I don't want any National League to win (unless of course they're playing the Yankees...).  Like the Mets are going to be winning the World Series anytime soon... right... like they have any players under the age of 35....  I joined a fantasy basketball league with some people in my class.  I know nothing about basketball.  I read six different sets of rankings and tried to combine them together to get a consensus.  We drafted yesterday.  It's sad that even my first round pick -- Dirk Nowitzki -- I simply had never heard of before yesterday.  Stephon Marbury is the only guy on my team I had heard of before.  I didn't get Jordan or Pippen or Malone or Stockton or Grant Hill (the 5 players I had actually heard of), but I imagine those are good things, since they must be quite elderly by now.  It'll be fun to see if I can do well at Fantasy Basketball knowing absolutely nothing about what goes on in the NBA... heck, maybe it'll make me into a fan.  Or prove to me that fantasy sports success has no relationship to actual knowledge.  Which would be a disappointment, since I really do enjoy fantasy baseball....  We'll see....

      This post sounds mildly insane, but I'm trying to puzzle out this notion that I'm been thinking about this afternoon, and figure maybe writing it down will help.  So excuse the strange-ness.  More and more, I find myself feeling like there are a limited number of "types" of people in the world.  Like a bunch of people fall into the "generic friendly normal person" category, but then you get a set number of alternatives like "pompous jackass" or "insane aggressive dude," and that if you could somehow develop a list of all these types -- and maybe there are 20, i don't know, you could easily fit 99% of people into their appropriate category.  What I find myself doing is looking to compare people I meet here to people I know from before -- like "Oh, Jim is like Mike, only with a little more energy and fewer moral qualms," and stuff like that.  And then I find myself looking for people who fit into the types I'm most drawn to.  Like "melancholy introspective thinker" and "sarcastic observer with good heart" and "sunny extrovert mind-reader."  I don't know if this makes any sense at all.  It's hard to find people in those three categories, really.  Maybe they're too specific.  Or hard to sense right off the bat, whereas "phony social climber" and "just doesn't understand the world around him/her" are so easy to pick up on right away.  I should read some Myers-Briggs stuff.  I think studying personalities would be fascinating.  I think I've just turned off anyone who's reading this entry.  I would say that if anyone has stumbled across this weblog and thinks they fall into any of the three categories I listed as desirable, send me an e-mail and let me know I'm not insane.  :)

      I had an interesting conversation with someone in my section the other day about our impressions regarding law school so far.  A few observations we were able to articulate that I hadn't really reflected on before:  1. The people here from what U.S. News might call less stellar undergraduate universities are in some ways (and this very much a generalization) more impressive than the people from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc.  And I think the reason is because to get in here from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc is, while "easy" probably isn't the right word, certainly it's easi*er*.  The people here from SUNY Albany, or the University of Oklahoma, or any number of schools, presumably had to be really extraordinary -- at the very top of their class, or have had some outside work experience that's unique and interesting and makes them stand out.  While the people from Harvard, Yale, Princeton, etc have a little more wiggle room.  I know I wasn't at the top of my class -- I told someone during the first week here that I had two C's on my transcript and the reaction I got was "...and they still let you in?" -- but undergraduate background becomes a plus as opposed to something that has to be compensated for, like if your school is the University fo Utah.  So I think a lot of the impressive people -- I know a doctor, a couple of phD's, just as examples -- are the ones not from U.S. News's favorite places.  Which I hadn't really reflected on before.   2. This place is really pitched at 22-year-olds right out of undergrad.  ...and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  But I've definitely been surprised at how little difference there is between this and undergrad, from a lifestyle perspective, and even from a schoolwork perspective.  For me, I'm happy with that -- I loved undergrad, and I'm thrilled that there are lots of opportunities here to meet people, that there are lots of activities to get involved in, that -- although to a lesser degree than Princeton undergrad, but still enough -- it's not hard to get into a routine where this is your entire world, especially if you live on campus.  I mean that less negatively than it sounds -- all I mean is that unlike a job (or at least unlike the job I had before coming here), you don't need to make connections external to the law school, to go into Boston and find activities to get involved with unrelated to school, to make friends in town, stuff like that.  Those opportunities are there if you want them, I'm sure.  And for people with lots of Boston connections before coming here, I'm sure they find it refreshing to talk to non-law school people and maybe even find it frustrating that they don't have *more* time to spend outside of here -- but for me, I'm awfully happy that I've been able to find enough that I'm fulfilled without being forced to go searching in the "real world" for things to fill my time and energy and keep me satisfied.  So in that sense it's a lot like undergrad -- in a good way for most, but if someone has a family, and, well, a Life outside of Harvard Law School, I can imagine it's frustrating.  And, similarly, just as an aside, the Socratic method of teaching is certainly pitched more at a 22-year-old than at an "adult" (yeah, I know lots of 22-year-olds probaly think of themselves as adults.  I'm 23 and certainly don't).  Being questioned, and pushed, and potentially embarassed in class (although that's so much more in people's heads than for real -- no one remembers who gets an answer wrong, and even more so, no one cares) is not really an adult technique, and if I was 35 I'd probably be more than a little annoyed by a teacher treating me like a 5-year-old.  But at 23, I'm totally cool with it.   3.  A little work experience goes a long way.  Just seeing what's out there besides school I think really makes a difference.  I was joking with someone that I feel like I can tell who's straight through from undergrad and who tok some time off.  I was wrong on the two cases they tested me on, but still I think it's a valid idea, generally.  There's something different about the people who have had a job, even just for a year -- they know there's something more out there, they have more of a reason for being here and understand that school isn't the entire universe.  I think for a lot of people straight out of undergrad, they're here because it's the next logical step.  It's what it made sense to do.  And they haven't really thought about *why* they want to be here, and they don't really know what their other options were, and they have nothing to measure law school against in terms of a job or real-world experience.  Whereas the people who were out in the world have a little tiny bit of perspective, and realize that if law school isn't for them, or being a lawyer isn't for them, there are other options, and they've seen what they are.  And because they made a conscious decision to leave something else to come here -- as opposed to just right here when undergrad ended -- I think there's more of an element that they have a reason to be here -- or at least they know why they made the choice and they're not wishing they were elsewhere or wondering what life would have been like if not here.

      When there are events on campus, the practice here is that people write them on the blackboards in all of the classrooms.  Today there was an announcement for a Halloween party on Saturday sponsored by the Student Activities Council.  Except they spelled sponsored wrong -- "s-p-o-n-s-E-r-e-d."  Maybe it was part of the Halloween theme, because the idea that Harvard students can't spell sponsored is pretty darn scary.

      I was getting worried because I couldn't think of a newspaper column idea for next week -- but then they told me that next week there's no newspaper.  So I'm off the hook.  But the reason why there's no newspaper gave me a good idea for a column.  Ah, the conundrum of it all.  Anyway, the reason there's no paper is because it's "flyout week," when the 2Ls go to callback interviews around the country for their law firm jobs for the summer.  By "around the country" I mean New York and DC.  Because those are the only places anyone gets jobs.

      Here's something scary.  I just laughed at something in a contracts case.  I have become comfortable enough with reading these cases that I was actually able to find humor in a court's opinion.  This is very scary.  Let me try to share without being incomprehensible.  There's this case where a big company took out a loan from another big company, and the contract clearly says the company can't pay it off early.  But they want to pay it off early because interest rates have gone down and they're locked into a high rate.  So they sue, claiming that while the contract is clear, the intent of the parties when they signed it was to allow early payment -- and they have evidence they want to present regarding that.  The court wants to say no, this is ridiculous, you're stuck in your contract, you can't show us extrinsic evidence when the contract is so unambiguosly clear.  Go away.  But, there's a prior case where the court decided that words are never completely unambiguous and that one should always be able to show extrinsic evidence to determine intent.  So the court here is stuck.  Even though they really want to dismiss the case.  So the opinion says, "While we have our doubts about the wisdom of [the prior case], we have no difficulty understanding its meaning,  even without extrinsic evidence to guide us ."  This is funny stuff.  This is laugh-out-loud law going on here.  And, yes, I realize how pathetic that makes me sound.  I have reached rock bottom: I am laughing at case law.

      Is there a good way to get rid of junk e-mail?  I get about 5 e-mails a day regarding lowering my credit card debt or refinancing a mortgage, and while 5 e-mails a day is not an intolerably large number, it bothers me when I hear the incoming e-mail bell ring and then I'm disappointed.  It's a real disappointment too, not just like the mild inconvenience when i swallow mouthwash by accident, or the fitted sheet starts to slide off my mattress in the middle of the night.  I don't just want a filter that'll hide the evil e-mail -- because then I'll constantly worry I'm filtering out something real by accident.  I want a way to get myself off their lists.  But everyone says that if you do waht they say to do to unsubscribe, they just put you on more lists.  Does anybody have a solution?

      Searching for random stuff on Lexis-Nexis is a great way to waste time.  I uncovered a two-year-old article from Esquire magazine about five 1990 Harvard Law graduates and what they were doing ten years later.  Learned that stand-up comic Greg Giraldo (he's had a couple of failed sitcoms too...) has a Harvard Law degree.  I'm not sure if there's a lesson there or not.  Interesting article though.  Now that the Gilbert and Sullivan shw is over, I feel like I have a lot of free time.  It's been over for a day, and already I'm feeling that.  Not good.  The show was fun, though.  I'm glad I did it.  I met a bunch of cool people, got to fill in my days for the last few weeks, and most importantly I met the people involved in the law school parody show in the spring -- a student-written musical comedy that makes fun of the law school.  First writers meeting on Tuesday.  I'll be there with bells on.  Actually, I'll be there with sketches and songs in my pocket.  Literally.  I am more excited about getting involved with that than I am about anything else here.  Isn't that disturbing?  Doesn't it mean I'm in the wrong place???  I should really be doing my contracts reading right now, but I feel like after having done laundry this afternoon, I've accomplished enough for one day.  There was some sort of odd attempted sabotage in the laundry -- there was a fountain pen ink cartridge in one of the dryers.  I'm lucky I noticed it before I put my clothes in, or else they would've been ruined.  I didn't think much of it at the time, but now I'm wondering how exactly an ink cartridge -- alone, without a pen -- gets into a dryer without there being some sort of bad motive.  I'm completely baffled.  Because even if it was some sort of intentional bad-ness, the perpetrator wouldn't be around to see the results.  So I don't get it.

      I have a desperate urge to create a mock powerpoint presentation parodying the powerpoint we were shown the other day at a "career services orientation session."  There were 5 slides:  Slide 1 -- a quote from an alumnus about how valuable working for a law firm is. Slide 2 -- % of graduates who go to work for law firms, public interest organizations, etc. Slide 3 -- average salary of graduates who go to work for law firms vs. public interest Slide 4 -- % of graduates who find jobs as compared with the national average.  Big surprises here. Slide 5 -- law firm retention rate after x years out of school.  My spoof coming by the middle of the week hopefully.  If I can find a way to attach a powerpoint file to the weblog, I'll do that.  Otherwise, you'll have to e-mail me for it.

      I'm making up a new verb.  "Final drafticizing."  Fairly straightforward what it means.  I'm spending the morning (uh... and the afternoon, I guess... this isn't very productive...) turning my first draft memo into the final draft that's going to get "graded."  I'm putting "graded" in quotes because the writing workshop is pass/fail.  This is an utterly useless exercise.  They made us write the first draft and hand it in, and gave us comments back.  It's fairly clear to me that if the first draft was really the final draft, and was getting graded, I'm well past the threshold to receive a "pass" rather than a "fail."  So the incentive to make any changes to this thing is virtually zero.  I know I'm getting a pass, it doesn't matter what I do.  I already wrote the memo two weeks ago and don't really want to go back and work on it more.  If they want us to write a memo, just make us write something and then grade it on a real scale.  This hand-holding -- first draft, then comments, then a final draft, plus not really a grade, just pass-fail -- seems kind of pathetic given that we're in law school, not third grade.

      The Gilbert and Sullivan show I'm in has its third and final performance tonight.  We're trying to break speed records -- 33 minutes last night from start to finish.  It's a brief little adventure.  An e-mail from our first-year-lawyering workshop instructor regarding the professor and class on Monday -- "Also, I know that there has been some discontent about the amount of FYL work you have.  [The professor] is aware of it, too, and he will address the issue in the lecture on Monday."  Should be entertaining to hear.  Frankly I'm sick of people complaining about the work -- it's a pass-fail course, and everyone passes.  It's really not that brutal.  Doesn't one give up the right to complain about schoolwork when they go to Harvard Law School?

      First draft of next week's newspaper column:  Im Sorry, Dean Clark  The invasion of the suits finally spread to the 1Ls last week.  At least to my section.  But it wasnt overeager students flagrantly violating the ban on summer job searching until December 1.  No, that will have to wait for next week.  It was just for yearbook photos.  And for our sections reception with Dean Clark.  First, the yearbook photos.  Im not sure if that was really a legitimate reason to wear a suit.  They suggested we wear business attire.  But doesnt that depend on what business youre in?  What if youre a lifeguard?  A hooker?  A clown?  An underwear model?  I think its a bit of a stretch to assume that business attire means you have to wear a suit.  Its presumptuous.  What if I cant get any of the jobs that require suits and Im stuck wearing a paper hat and apron?  Then assuming that suit and tie as business attire will make me feel awfully silly.  But Ill excuse the people who simply wanted to look spiffy for their yearbook photo.  After all, yearbook photos are permanent.  Like these columns I write.  Gosh.  Harder to excuse are the people wearing suits for our sections reception with Dean Clark.  Right before our reception, we had our OCS/OPIA orientation session, which I suppose was an even worse occasion to wear a suit.  The orientation presented us with a number of graphs about the career prospects for graduates.  First, a graph showing the number of graduates who went to firms as compared with the number who took public interest jobs.  It was like a graph comparing the Harvard endowment to the change Ive collected in a plastic cup on my desk.  The only way it could have looked worse is if theyd used a logarithmic scale.  The second graph showed the percent of graduates who get jobs as compared with the national average.  Perhaps it would have been a fairer competition had they compared the percent of graduates who get jobs with the percent of people with beating hearts.  Are we really supposed to be surprised that everyone gets a job after graduating from here?  Is this news to anybody?  Anyway, after the exciting career orientation, it was off to the Dean Clark reception.  With the people in suits.  Unnecessary for a few reasons.  First, they said thered be food there.  And my policy is anywhere where theres food is a dangerous place to wear my one suit (actually its not even really a suit  I have a jacket and a pair of pants that come oh-so-close to matching.  Barely visible to the naked eye.  Almost cant tell one piece is navy blue and the other is black.  Almost.  Goes great with my olive green only-pair-of-dress-socks and my brown shoes.).  So easy to get it dirty, and then what?  Complete and utter disaster.  Plus, what could the consequences possibly be of not wearing a suit?  Would Dean Clark kick us out of school?  Erase our entries from the log we had to sign to get our ID cards?  Ensure we get a low pass grade in FYL?  Wheres the incentive?  And, frankly, the reception wasnt really worth a suit.  Maybe a polo shirt and a pair of khakis, but definitely not a suit.  The leap from styrofoam plates to real ceramic was impressive, though.  As was the food.  A step above the goldfish and assorted crackers at the all-law school party (does Harvard own stock in Pepperidge Farm?), there were miniature spinach pies, fried wontons, little triangles of toast baked with cheese, assorted fruit, and other finger food that in large enough quantities makes for a filling and nutritious dinner.  Especially if you brought a Ziploc bag and loaded up on the chicken on a stick.  There were also some assorted flavors of what more sophisticated members of my section told me was pat.  It looked kind of like slabs of clay to me, so Im not sure.  Tasted like clay too.  The highlight of the reception with the Dean was when he told us some of the accomplishments of people in our section, like he did for the whole class during orientation: a Fulbright scholar, a Truman scholar, two people with an allergy to peanuts, one student who still wets the bed, three hypochondriacs, one convicted felon, four transvestites, and a former stunt double for Barney the dinosaur.  Now theres one person whose business attire most certainly wasnt a three-piece suit.

      We had to go take pictures for the yearbook today.  They suggested "business attire."  What exactly does that mean?  Doesn't it depend on what business you're in?  What if you're a lifeguard?  Or a hooker?  Or an underwear model?  Or a professional football player?  Business attire is a vague and ambiguous concept.  This is the kind of thinking law school forces us to do.

      I sent my section a mass e-mail about the show I'm in this week.  I think it's kinda funny:  Apologies for sending a mass e-mail.  I'm a jury member in this weekend's production of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Trial by Jury" and the director is making me tell people about it so we have an audience.    The show is Thursday, Friday, and Saturday at 8pm in Ames Courtroom.  The show takes place in a courtroom.  So that meant we didn't have to build a set, which was good.    It costs $5.  (Random fact: in 1875, when the musical was written, $5 in today's money was equivalent to 31 cents.)  Tickets are on sale in the Hark tomorrow from 10-2, or you can buy them at the door.  I don't get the feeling that you should worry at all about it being sold out if you wait to buy them at the door, but they didn't tell me to say that in my e-mail, so I make no promises.  Frequently Asked Questions  "What's the show about?"  Bitter over Edwin's refusal to marry, Angelina takes him to court to recover damages.  Edwin is forced to defend himself in front of a jury and a wacky judge.  Hijinks ensue.   "Is it all music, or if I come will I be forced to sit through boring dialogue too?"  No dialogue.  All songs.  Isn't that a relief.  "But 8pm on Thursday, Friday and/or Saturday nights are my favorite times to study."  That's not a question, it's a statement.  But anyway, the show is only 45 minutes long.  And besides, it contains a bunch of legal terms, like "breach of contract," and "court of the exchequer," and "be firm, be firm, my pecker."  (Those last two rhyme.)  So it's really sort of educational.  "But if it's only 45 minutes long, why is it worth my $5?"  Sorry, no more questions.  "Couldn't you have said all this in about three lines instead of writing this whole long e-mail?"  I said no more questions.  "Okay, okay, I get it.  Sorry."

      Another "stumbled across" web site -- they seem to come in bunches, don't they -- Worth magazine did a study of the Top High Schools in the nation for getting students into Harvard/Yale/Princeton.  Seems like an awfully narrow view of a high school's excellence, but I'm sure there's a demand for this kind of information out there.  94 of the top 100 are private schools.  I'm not sure that can be called a surprise, but I would have expected it to be less overwhelmingly skewed.  To get 50 public schools, they had to go to spot 294 on their list.  930 of 31,700 nationwide high schools sent at least 4 students to Harvard, Yale, and Princeton combined in the four years 1998-2001.  More than half of those sent less than 1%.  School #1 sent 21%.  School #100 sent 4%.  And the rest inbetween (obviously).   urlLink High School Rankings     My alma mater is the top ranked public school, which is pretty cool.  #26 overall.  I think this list is a great argument for a private school voucher system, because it shouldn't have to cost $20,000 a year to get a real chance at these schools.  Obviously there's some self-selecting going on, but still....

      Just stumbled across an incredibly pointless editorial in the Daily Princetonian about the evils of Diet Coke.   urlLink Diet Coke is Evil   It strikes me that I often use the phrase "stumbled across" when talking about articles or websites I've found.  I guess that makes me sound less pathetic than if I were to say "found in the course of my reading" or "searched for and found."  Truth is, in this case, I do try and check the Daily 'Prince every couple of days or so, in case there's anything interesting.  And in the case below, I was actually searching for other law student weblogs -- so to say I "stumbled across" it is not exactly forthcoming.  I read stuff on the web too much.  It's a mild addiction -- there's always more interesting news to find.  And I know it makes no sense to read the sports sections of 5 different New York area newspapers each morning to get the widest perspective possible on the Mets' search for a new manager, especially since they're all tailored versions of the same Assoicated Press wire story.  But it's healthier than Diet Coke, at least according to the 'Prince article.

      My weblog has some competition, sadly enough.  They don't know it yet, but I've been scoping out whatever weblogs I can find written by other law students.  There's one that's got something somewhat thought-provoking today about law students that I completely disagree with.  Here's a long and out-of-context plagiarized quote:  "There are few things that get me angrier then law students in my position complaining about the difficulty of law school. Before I say anything else, however, let me be clear. 'Nothing I say here refers in the slightest to people... [in] difficult positions, with responsibilities for children, aging parents, or whatver. All this is about is people like me; just out of college, completely unburdened professional students. Now, what could possibly be difficult about law school in this position? We're surrounded by young people, even (let me add!) those of the opposite sex. We're studying interesting material; material made interesting, let me be clear, not by my personality but by its nature. We study the very bones of our society. Outside the law school, many of us live in interesting places, and at least the rest of the university is around to provide entertainment. We're mostly young and healthy, and in general, the work is demanding but not overwhelming. And, if the great problem of life for many of us is finding something to do, then, law school fits the bill exactly. What, then, is the problem? Do people expect endless hilarity?  Actually, I think people do expect to be constantly entertained, and consequently, when they're not, they become unhappy... You know, our jobs sometimes just aren't going to be very interesting. Certainly, they'll be more demanding then law school. And at that point, it's going to be these daily routines that are going to save us from complete depression. It's going to be the gentle sizzling of the onions in the pan, the stirring of the risotto, the weekly walk to the supermarket or to the dry cleaners or whatever, that's going to keep us going. If you see the basic functioning of your life as a chore, then you place too high a burden on the rest of your life to be fun and interesting. When the rest doesn't deliver, you're probably going to be in trouble."  (Here's a link citation  urlLink This Other Guy's Weblog  -- but please don't abandon me for him.    Anyway, I have a beef with his argument.  I don't see what's so bad about wanting our lives to be interesting, and not being satisfied with the routines and the everyday.  Yes, it's nice to be able to appreciate the little things in life -- and often the little things deserve appreciation.  But if the little things are what's "save[ing you] from complete depression" then aren't you in trouble?  Doesn't it mean that your life's pursuits are wrong?  I can't help but think that this is the rationalization for going to work in a big corporate law firm -- everyone knows they won't enjoy the work, that the 20-hour days will be grueling, that the lifestyle will be unhappy and lonely and boring and unfulfilling, albeit lucrative (but what good is the money if you have no time to spend it?).  So people start making absurd claims that jobs aren't supposed to be interesting, and life isn't supposed to be fun and exciting.    I have to admit, my argument falls apart if I broaden my circle of awareness -- it is unfortunate but true that there are lots of jobs very important to society that are not interesting.  We have waiters and janitors and secretaries and IRS auditors who do things that have great utility but probably are not spectacularly interesting and rewarding.  And they're only there to make money to support themselves and their families and not because it's their dream job.  Fair enough.  But, at the risk of sounding elitist (at the certainty of sounding elitist, I should say), I'm at Harvard Law School.  If people here (and by "here" I really mean a broader circle than Harvard -- I mean the, I don't know, 10% of the population that goes to reasonably selective colleges and universities and has a wide variety of doors open to them, and isn't forced to take a job in CVS as the only means for survival.  It's an elitist argument, but I'm not so elitist as to single out this place as special -- I mean people fortunate enough to get educated and have options, that's all)  aren't in a position to find a job that is at least interesting and fulfilling, then who the heck IS?  And if society is set up in such a way that there are NO jobs that are truly rewarding, then we're in trouble.  It's an awfully low bar being set if the goal isn't at least to have a job that's interesting and rewarding.  I feel bad for my fellow law student if he's truly bracing himself for a life one smell of risotto away from constant depression.

      I saw "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" on Friday night, and I'm going to see "Moonlight Mile" tonight.  I liked "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" more than I thought I would.  I heard someone's theory the other day about there being more short people here than one would expect.  I'm not sure I'd noticed this phenomenon, but I guess it's more the case that there just aren't a ton of really tall people, not that there are lots of short people.  But anyway, this person's theory was that short people work harder in school to compensate for their height.  This sounds like utter baloney to me.  I don't buy this theory at all -- even if I did think there were an unusual number of short people here, which I don't.  I was explaining to someone yesterday that my dream job would be to write for a TV show.  She said, "oh, you want to be an entertainment lawyer?"  I said, "no.  I want to be on the other side of the table.  The one who needs the lawyer."  Explaining this took forever -- this girl simply could not fathom that someone would have this desire to write as opposed to practice law.  Completely inconsistent with being at law school.  Oh wait, I guess it is...

      This is the kind of learning you're missing if you're not in law school.  I just sent an e-mail to my study group:  "I have a really specific question about today's class that I was going to try and articulate into an e-mail to Prof. Warren, but I'm kind of scared to do that, so I figured I'd see if any of you had the same thought as I did or could tell me where my logic is going wrong.  Apologies if this makes no sense -- it made really good sense in my head during class but now it's not as clear to me, looking back at my notes.  But anyway --  Regarding Nebraska Seed, when Prof. Warren was looking for reasons why we take the soft-edged approach of inferring the "invitation to deal" term instead of the hard-edged approach of requiring people to write in their advertisements that it wasn't an offer ---  If the default is "this is an offer," we run the risk of binding people into contracts they don't intend (like unsophisticated parties who don't know they need to include the invitation term), but if the default is "just an invitation," then the only risk we run is that two parties who both want to enter a contract, and are agreed on the terms, need to take that one extra step of invitation-offer-acceptance.    So the soft-edged rule doesn't really have any potential to cause any harm -- because if people want to make a contract, and agree on the terms, then another step won't stop them.  But the hard-edged rule does have the potential to bind people who don't mean to be bound, so there is possible harm.  And that seemed to me like an argument in favor of the soft rule, but it wasn't one of Prof. Warren's in class.  (Just as an aside -- I'm realizing that under my logic here, transaction costs might be higher with the soft rule -- because of the extra step needed (invitation-offer-acceptance versus offer-acceptance), which is the opposite of the transaction costs issue Prof. Warren talked about in class -- higher with the hard rule because you need a lawyer ---- but aside from transactions costs, I'm wondering if my reasoning makes any sense)  Does this make any sense at all (or have I, as I suspect, done a really crappy job of articulating what the heck I'm talking about)?    Thanks."

Now I know why.  No, seriously, it was nothing.  But clearly this place had never seen educated people before.  It was full of middle-aged drunk people with beards (even the women) and plaid shirts.  I don't know what that means, I'm just trying to paint a picture here.

      Draft of my next column.  If you've been reading this weblog since the beginning, you'll recognize a chunk in the middle.  Otherwise, it's all new stuff:  This afternoon, I ventured into the basement of Pound in search of a cure.  A cure for this pesky sore throat I mustve caught from one of those classmates whos always opening his mouth and spreading germs (along with words upon words upon self-indulgent words) throughout the classroom.  So I went to the law school health center.  Where they told me I had a sore throat (thats the medical term for a sore throat), and that I should try my best to stay healthy.  Thats very practical advice.  The nurse gave me a sheet with some tips for dealing with a sore throat.  There was a list that began with the instruction, call your doctor right away if any problems develop including the following.  Already a problem.  There was no doctor.  Only a nurse.  But anyway.  Call your doctor if: you are worse in any way.  Does being a day older count?  How about falling behind on the reading?  Does that qualify?    Other reasons to call your doctor: confusion, drowsiness, or loss of memory.  Sounds like what happens when I get called on in class.  Trouble walking or controlling arms and legs.  Yes, that does sound like a pretty ominous development from a sore throat.  Drooling. Huh?  Anything else that worries you.  Again, the open-ended problem.  Im worried about this war with Iraq.  Is that a good reason to call my doctor?  After reading the oh-so-helpful sheet, I figured it would be a good idea to check over the restrictions in the health care plan, just in case try[ing] my best to stay healthy doesnt end up working out for me.  A few observations we all ought to be aware of about our health coverage (these are real):  Because it's not a dental plan, injuries to teeth are only covered when not due to a biting or chewing incident. So if we fall on our heads and break a tooth, great, we're covered. But if we bite into a rock masquerading as a chicken breast in the Hark, no such luck.  Not covered: voluntary sterilization, tattoo removal, and repetitive procedures (such as injection of varicose veins or hemorrhoids).  How about subciting?  Thats a repetitive procedure.  The removal of wisdom teeth is covered only if the teeth are impacted in the bone. Exciting to think about.  Ambulance rides are only covered for certain participating ambulance services. Because when you need an ambulance, of course you're always going to be the one calling.  I suppose one of those medic alert bracelets would come in handy in a case like this  If I am injured and require an ambulance, please use one of the following companies: Hospital Express, Bleed-n-Go Ambulance Service, Hit-n-Run Emergency, Bob's Stretch-er Limousines, or No Frills Emergency Room Wheelbarrows, Inc. Do not under any circumstances allow me to be placed in a Roger's Ambulance and Dog Catcher vehicle  it is not covered by my insurance.  The plan excludes coverage for treatment for obesity... except as required by applicable law. Hmmm. I guess we'll learn about those laws in our Obesity Law class next semester.  Taught by the guy who plans the menus at the Hark.  Actually, the menus at the Hark arent so terrible.  But something that was disturbing  the other week I was getting lunch and decided to get a bottle of Tropicana grapefruit juice. Opened it up, took a sip. Tasted fine. Then I noticed the date on the bottle  Jan 19 02. Uh, that was almost 10 months ago. Freaked me out. I threw it away. I guess I was wrong to go against the Nantucket Nectars monopoly, and that was my punishment.  Id never seen Nantucket Nectars in cans before coming here.  Or in vending machines.  Or coming out of water fountains.  Or the sinks in the bathroom.  Or my shower.  Or in the swimming pool at the Mac.  Half and half.  Half lemonade, half chlorine.  Its delicious.  And would kill all those germs that caused my sore throat (see, it all comes back full circle).

      Today in contracts class, the professor said it wouldn't be a bad idea for people to eventually form study groups.  She's inadvertently (or --gasp-- intentionally?) unleashed a monster.  I just got an e-mail inviting me to join a study group.  The long slow march towards exams has apparently begun for my section.  Thanks, Professor. Ugh.

      Ideas are starting for my next column.  Here's what I've got so far --  Before coming here, people kept telling me that law school was like high school  with lockers, required subjects, and classes with the same set of people.  But after Field Day last weekend, I think high school may have been pushing it.  Law school is really fifth grade.  My school had a Field Day in fifth grade.  It was pretty much like this one.  Except for the eight kegs.  And the section subciting competition.  (Kidding.)  But I think that may have been the last time I played dodgeball.  And I havent gotten any better at it than I was then.  In fifth grade, I remember there was an obsession with being one of the cool kids.  I'm not sure what being 'cool" meant in fifth grade -- I think it was still to young to be dating or anything like that, so that wasn't it.  I guess it was all about not getting beat up during recess, or getting invited to the boy-girl parties.  Or having someone to sit next to on the bus during field trips.  Or at the lunch table.  But I do remember that I wasn't one of the cool kids.  I'd be willing to bet that most people here weren't.  We were the smart kids.  The cool kids then are the ones working at the gas station now.  Or in business school.

      I went to a speech on "Finding your Identity at Harvard Law School" this evening.  I thought it sounded like it would be really interesting -- that it would cover some of the territory I spend way too much energy thinking about.  About people fitting in"the box" and stuff like that.  But no.  It was a psychology gobbledygook speech about finding a place where Personal values, Community values and Professional values converge into one.  It didn't make any practical sense.  It was mumbo-jumbo.  I have no idea what the guy was talking about.  So disappointing.  Because I thought it was really going to be about the stuff I obsess about.

      I turned my song about the socratic method into 4-part harmony today.  My first time trying that.  I think it turned out okay.  I'll bring it to a capella rehearsal on Tuesday and see what they think.  I know I haven't written anything substantial or funny in the last couple of days -- just not much to say I guess.  But I promise, tomorrow will be a banner day here on the weblog.  I'm talking pages of gut-busting hilarity.  I promise.  Or I will delete this post.  :)

      I missed Saturday Night Live last night -- ended up staying at this party I went to for longer than I thought.  Got into a conversation  with like 6 people from my section that lasted about 2 hours, so that was cool.

      I played dodgeball today at Field Day.  And, yes, this is really fifth grade, not law school.  It was fun, even though my section lost.  People were protesting, saying the other team cheated.  "Breach of Contract," they yelled.  No, I'm making that up.  Tonight is the season premiere of Saturday Night Live.  My expectations are low.  I'll post a review after it's over.

      Computer virus came back.  But I think I got rid of it again.  I think the network is giving it to me.  Oh well.  I went to the law school bookstore to buy some paper for my printer and made an impulse purchase -- a miniature stapler for $3.00.  It's sad when a stapler becomes an impulse buy.  But I needed it.  Because when I handed in my legal memo -- which needed to be staple, according to the instructor's oh-so-informative "last minute questions" e-mail -- I had to go lurking around the administrative offices until I found one with a stapler right on the front desk that I could sneak in and quickly use.  I saw "Red Dragon" last night.  It was okay -- for a scary movie (not my usual preferred genre -- I like my movies short and funny) it was pretty good.  Today is "Field Day" from 12-5, featuring activities like Tug of War, Dodgeball, and Check a Footnote in Twenty Seconds.  Or something like that.  I have rehearsal from 12-2, so I'll be late to Field Day, but according to what people have been saying, the turnout won't be that good anyway.  More about Field Day later.

      Legal memo due tomorrow.  Finishing up my proofreading.  Was delayed a bit because of a computer virus.  Fun stuff.  I had to do all sorts of weird stuff -- create a boot disk, type in commands in DOS, run crazy virus-checking programs -- but I think I've eliminated it without any ill effect.  I had all my stuff backed up onto CD so I wouldn't have lost any information, but still, it was annoying to have to waste time eradicating a virus from my computer.  Ah-choo.

      More on Bobby Valentine's firing -- I read in the NY Times (or maybe it was the Post, or Newsday, or the Daily News, or the Bergen Record, of the Star-Ledger -- sadly, I check 'em all each morning for the Mets articles... obsessed perhaps?  ...but I'll pretend I read this thing in the Times because it sounds more credible that way) that Valentine demanded more input as far as roster decisions and who to sign and trade for, and that forced the owner to make a choice.  So I think he made the wrong choice of who to fire, but at least it seems to be the case that one of 'em had to be fired... so it's not like he just decided to give up on Valentine without any provocation.  I want to watch some playoffs tonight, and I have no other activities besides working on my memo due Friday, so I should at least get to catch some baseball in the background of my editing and footnoting...

      I don't know what's with all the kinda-dumb e-mails I'm getting recently, but here's another:  from my First-Year-Lawyering Workshop professor, regarding our memo due Friday:  "Some of you have asked logistical questions that may be of interest to the whole group, so I share them (and my answers) below.  SHOULD I NUMBER THE PAGES?  Yes, please number each page.  ARE THERE ANY FORMAT REQUIREMENTS?  Yes, please see the handout you received detailing your memo format requirements, and follow them strictly.  MUST I STAPLE THE MEMO?  Yes, please do."  [Did people really ask him these questions?????]

      Here's a very rough first cut at my newspaper column for next week.  It needs work, but I think the idea works.  If you read this, please do send me some feedback -- it's appreciated.  The Box  Everywhere we go now, we see people in suits. (And I dont mean law suits. Sorry, not funny.) 2Ls and 3Ls with three dozen interviews over six days, or six dozen interviews over three days, or ten dozen interviews over lunch tomorrow from noon until one. By all accounts, pretty much no one passes up the opportunity to at least try and get an offer from a corporate firm. Just to be safe. Even if they know they dont want to end up there. Because its just for one summer. Because its only a few years. Just until the loans are paid off. Only until I make partner. Just until I can retire. Only until the day that I die. It cant be that bad. Everyone does it.  Ive heard people try to explain why this happens -- why people start law school dead-set against working for a big firm, but end up selling out. And, yes, I know there are lots of great reasons to go work for a firm, not least of which being to pay off student loans, but also because you can make good contacts, some people really do find it interesting, your salary gives your relatives something to brag about (as if just going to Harvard Law School isnt enough!), and so forth. Im sure well get a big glossy brochure with all of these reasons (and pictures of happy, smiling, multi-ethnic men, women, and domesticated animals) from every law firm in the country when its the appropriate time.   But aside from these good and justifiable reasons, I think its mostly about expectations. It seems like from the first day of orientation, theres an expectation that everyone here will fit into a certain box. Went to a good college, majored in something appropriately related to the study of law, had some sort of law or business-related job or internship -- paralegal, management consultant, investment banker -- and has a burning desire to use his or her law degree to either (a) help a specific set of people -- the poor, children, taxpayers, foreigners, sports figures, or (b) make a lot of money.  Or both.  And thats The Box. Its what all of those questions people ask you during orientation are designed to put you in. Whered you go to school? Whatd you do before you came here? Whats your future goal? Harvard, I sold stocks in management consulting firms to paralegals, I want to help the poor children of professional soccer players pay taxes in Bolivia. Youre in the box. Wonderful.   And I think it excites us to meet people on the fringes of the box: Where are you from? Canada. Canada? Wow, thats cool!"  "But I went to Yale.  And my dad is a Supreme Court Justice.  Perfect. Youre in the box.  But people too far out of the box don't quite fit: What did you do before you came here? Juggled hoops of fire in the circus. Not in the box. Youre too different. You don't belong.   And no one doesnt want to belong. The Box has a magnetic pull. Its why everyone talks about his or her year at Oxford (and if I hear one more person force that into a conversation Oh, wow. Those trees remind me of trees we had -- when I was at Oxford, or I ate a turkey sandwich once -- at Oxford, The sky was blue -- at Oxford, We breathed air -- at Oxford.) and no one talks about his interest in snorkeling. Or her comic book collection. Or his innermost thoughts and feelings. (Ooh, thats too deep for a column trying to be funny. Sorry. I think I must have meant, Or his favorite Beatle.) Were scared that if we reveal too much, well put ourselves outside the box, and we wont belong. And that really is pretty scary.  So I think thats part of the reason why all of the 2Ls are dressed up in suits, going to fourteen dozen interviews in eight minutes, even if their hearts arent really in it. And why the deepest conversations in the Hark are about the weather, the Civ Pro reading, and the utility of Daylight Savings Time. But it doesnt have to be that way. We can make the box bigger. And find out the guy sitting next to us is from Canada. Or an amateur sumo wrestler. Or really a girl.

      Received the following e-mail last night from the residential advisor in my dorm (a 3rd-year student).  I think it's kind of funny:  Hello,  I wanted to let you all know that I have had numerous reports from residents that their food is being stolen from the kitchen. Clearly, this is not allowed and is very inconsiderate and disrepectful of the other residents.  As a result, I am taking steps to address these issues.  I want to remind you that no one is allowed to take, eat, or throw out any other resident's food.  At the same time, if you food has been stolen, you are not allowed to post hateful notes in the kitchen.  All signs in the kitchen have been posted by the housing office or the dorm Resident Assistants.  In an effort to resolve these problems, I am asking that if you have food in the kitchen, you label it with your name or your initials to rule out the possibility that people are taking food that they mistakenly believe is theirs. Also, if any food of yours has been taken or is taken in the future, please send me an e-mail informing me of what has been stolen. I want to ascertain how bad the situation is and how drastic the solutions need to be.   If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. Thank you in advance for your assistance.  Your RA.

      So close to Boston yet so far  The turkey was good.  Nobody vomited.  And my request not to have any squash at the meal was honored (Hark overkill).  So, all in all, Thanksgiving was a success.  I think its good to go home for a few days every once in a while.  I brought my contracts casebook home and it made a great prop for show-and-tell.  Look at this big heavy book we have!  Ooooh, they all said.  And theres stuff highlighted here, at the beginning.  And theres stuff highlighted here, at the end.  Aaaah, they all said.  Fun stuff.  Too bad the whole book isnt written in Russian, or in binary code, or ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics (Im picturing a hairy hand symbol here)  then the reaction would be even better.  Being home for a few days, seeing my family, seeing some friends, reminds me why Im in law school.  (In a parallel universe, the next sentence would include the phrases help people, correct injustice, and make large companies slightly larger through marginally justifiable litigation.  This is not that universe.)  All of my friends hate their jobs.  Maybe its just a fluke, and there are lots of people out there in the world, our age, who enjoy what theyre doing.  But I dont know any of those people.  Its not that Im happy my friends dont like their jobs  its just that it kind of makes me feel like Ive done the right thing by going to law school if I dont see anyone not in law school whos found something awesome to do.  Its kind of like when I watch Saturday Night Live, I root for it to be horrendously unfunny.  Not because I dont want to laugh, but because if Saturday Night Live really sucks, it gives me hope that maybe Im a better writer than the writers theyve got, and that makes me feel better about myself.  I have a friend whos a consultant.  He got sent to Geneva for 3 months.  He tells me thats in Switzerland.  I suppose Ill believe him.  He flies seven hours into Geneva on Monday, and flies back from Geneva seven hours on Thursday.  He says all hes seen in Geneva is the insides of the airport, the airport hotel, an office building right by the airport, and three different Starbucks branches.  This whole business travel thing?  Doesnt sound that cool.  Then again, if he were to ask me how much of Boston Ive seen, it probably wouldnt make him particularly jealous.  Well, Ive seen Boston Harbor from a boat.  I think.  Was that Boston Harbor on the 1L boat cruise, or was it the Charles River?  Or the Atlantic Ocean?  Or some big lake Harvard built using its endowment, actually in the middle of Allston?  Its weird that were so close to Boston, yet going into Boston seems like such an event.  More than once Ive decided not to go to a bar review because its all the way in Boston, as if Boston was across some giant ocean and the only way to get there was to swim.  Even the seven-minute walk from my dorm to Harvard Square sometimes seems like a chore.  (Thats the kind of attitude Three Aces depends on to get customers, isnt it?)  When people ask me how I like living in Boston, I find that I really dont have an answer.  None of the responses Ive tried  it seems nice, you know, a city is a city, theyre all pretty much the same, looks like fun on TV, and gets awfully cold in the winter,  really seem satisfying.  My latest attempt, well, how do you like living in... uh Portland? just gets me a puzzled stare.  I figure my best solution is probably to buy a Boston guidebook and read all about the cool things Im not seeing and doing, so I can at least talk intelligently about them.  (I know there must be another solution, but I cant quite think of it)  By the time I come home next month, Ill be armed with a whole set of anecdotes about Boston landmarks I havent seen  The Tremont Street Burial Grounds are a wonderful attraction if you want to learn all about Bostons Puritan history.  Almost as exciting as Kings Chapel, whose bell was originally cast by Paul Revere.  But you havent lived until youve wandered the streets just off the Freedom Trail and seen how contemporary Boston has incorporated its past.    Ill also bring some more items home for show-and-tell besides my contracts casebook.  Like my crim casebook, my civ pro casebook, and some of my professors past exams.  Which may in fact seem like theyre written in Russian, binary code, or ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.  Cant wait.

      I went to the movies this afternoon and saw "The Emperor's Club," a movie about a teacher at an elite boarding high school and his students.  It wasn't terrible, and actually pretty interesting -- if contrived but well-done movies about teachers and students are your cup of tea.  Not as good as Finding Forrester or Good Will Hunting, but not awful by any stretch.  The biggest problem I had was its predictability.  Every plot point was telegraphed a few minutes in advance and set up such that nothing was a surprise.  The most glaring example (and I'm really not giving anything away here) was that at one point in the movie, the students persuade the teacher to join them in a game of baseball, the pitcher convinced he'll strike him out without a problem.  Just then, the headmaster pulls up, across the courtyard, in his automobile.  Camera focus on the driver's side window.  I don't need to continue.  It's the attempted emotional manipulation of "Stepmom" combined with the "there's-a-deeper-meaning-here" of "Field of Dreams."  So if that sounds like something that wouldn't put you to sleep, I recommend it.

      Continuing this absurd theme (see below)... The World's Third Worst Cover Letter:  December 1, 2002  Shearman and Sterling New York, NY 10012  To Whom It May Concern:  I am a first-year law student at Harvard Law School, and I am not interested in a summer internship with your firm.  Not interested at all.  I am simply seeking to inquire -- just out of curiousity -- what kinds of things you might be looking for from people who ARE interested in a summer internship.  I don't mean me.  Like I already said.  For example, would telling you about how I spent last summer working for the Department of Justice and earning a Presidential Medal of Honor help me get a summer internship, if I wanted one?  Or would that be of relatively little importance compared to my award from the American Bar Association for dedicated service to the legal profession following my initiation while in college of a class action lawsuit on behalf of four million citizens injured by the plastic caps on soda bottles, resulting in a $16 million settlement and a feature article in the New York Times Magazine.  How about my 4.2 GPA at Yale?  My gold medal in the Luge event at the recent Winter Olympics?  My Nobel Peace Prize?  How about the fact that my father is a partner at your firm?  Would that help me?  Again, I'm not interested in a summer internship at your firm.  But I just thought I'd check whether or not my past experiences might help me -- if I ever was interested.  I'm available for an interview Tuesday afternoon.  Give me a call.

      The World's Second Worst Cover Letter:  December 1, 2002  Harry's Corporate Law Firm and Taco Shack 123 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10036  Dear Harry:  I'm a first-year law student at Harvard Law School -- and an avid consumer of Mexican food -- seeking a summer internship at either your law firm or taco shack.  In fact, my top preference would be to split the summer -- 5 weeks at the law firm, and 5 weeks at the taco shack.  My favorite kind of law is corporate litigation, and my favorite taco filling is spicy chicken with a green tomatillo salsa.  I have significant experience doing legal research, writing memos, and re-frying beans.  In fact, I'm a member of Harvard's Corporate Law Journal, and I eat at Anna's Taqueria at least twice a week.  I am a skilled negotiator, analyst, and vegetable chopper -- and have experience with Lexis-Nexis, Westlaw, and both whole wheat and corn tortillas.  I'll be in New York over Christmas, interviewing at law firms and taco emporiums throughout the city.  I would love to come in for an interview, armed with a resume and an apron.  I will call you next week to follow up.

      Apparently Adam Sandler's new cartoon movie, 8 Crazy Nights, is one hour and eleven minutes long.  71 minutes.  Pathetic.  If I'm going to pay $10 for a movie, I at least want 90 minutes of entertainment.  Or 90 minutes of something trying to be entertainment.  Or a 90-minute long nap in a nice comfortable seat.  71 minutes is ridiculous.  Regardless of quality.  Just my opinion...

      The World's Worst Cover Letter:  November 28, 2002 (Who cares about the December 1st restriction??)  Jones & O'Smith 123 Madison Avenue New York, NY 10101  Dear Hiring Partner (I would have called to get your name, but I was too lazy):  I'm a first-year law student at the 3rd-ranked law student in the country (we would have been first but there's a conspiracy), Harvard.  I'm sure you've heard of it.  I'm seeking a summer job where I can do very little and get paid a lot.  Your firm seems like a perfect fit.  Ever since I was a child, I've had an interest in whatever type of law it is that you specialize in.  The size of your firm, whether large or small, appeals to me very much.  And the location is somewhere I've always wanted to live.  Last summer, I worked for a firm that does very similar work to at least one firm that someone in your office may have heard of, meaning that I have the skills and talents needed to make a tremendous impact even from day one.  Plus, my uncle went to high school with the guy who used to wash the windows at your building until the unfortunate accident.  In college, I was a member of the RBA (Resume Builders Association), where I served as Associate Treasurer and Second Vice President of Marketing and Publicity.  Here at Harvard, I've become involved with a multitude of activities and interest groups, some of which are surely relevant to the work you do.  I am most proud of my involvement with the Consortium on Getting Summer Jobs, where I've learned valuable tricks like how I should stamp "confidential" all over my envelope so it gets opened by you and not your secretary.  Of course, that would be a more useful trick if I had bothered to call up and find out your name.  I think it's obvious that I'd be a perfect fit for a summer internship in whatever department is it that I seem to have expressed interest for in the first two paragraphs.  I look forward to hearing from you with a salary offer.  I will not actually take the time to call and follow up, so it is up to you to contact me.  Be aware that my phone number appears nowhere on this letter or my resume.  You'll have to do some detective work if you really want me.  I don't do interviews.  So don't even ask.  I know you're cheating on your wife.  I have pictures.  Trust me.  Sincerely, A Future Partner At Your Firm

      No snow on the ground here in New York, but apparently I missed from travel-difficultifying (yeah, I know that's not a word, or even anything close) snow in Boston.  It's weird to be home.  Not that much to do.  Went to the dentist this morning.  Fun stuff.  Read "The Death of Contracts" on the way home.  For class, not for fun.  Thank goodness.  I'd need some medical attention if I was reading something like that for fun.    Forgot to mention earlier this week -- I somehow got my first choice elective, International Environmental Law.  Even though there were only 15 slots open.  Out of 550 people who could have chosen it.  And in fact the class is still open, so it must have not been a very popular choice.  I had been planning on choosing Law and Education as my first choice, but 5 factors made me change my mind.  I offer them only to provide insight into the elective-choosing process (and because I can't think of anything else to write about...) (1) The professor for the Environmental class is a visiting professor, so it's a one-time-only thing; the Education class appears to be taught most years; (2) I found an outline for the course, and it looked kind of boring (but they all do...); (3) I spoke to some people who took the course last year and they had pretty mediocre things to say; (4) It's an 8-hour take home exam and the other one's a 3-hour in-class.  I like my exams short.  Like my [looking for something to put here that's funny, but I can't think of anything.  I'll come back to it.  Or if this is funnier than whatever I'm going to think of, I'll just leave this bracket in]; (5) I heard too many people talking about the Education class as their first choice and was afraid I wouldn't get it and be stuck with my 8th choice.  Which was Advanced Legal Research.  No, I'm kidding.  That would've been my 9th choice.  My 8th choice was Health Care Advocacy.  Which is probably as dismal as it sounds.  Anyway, I'm pleased that I got my first choice and am looking forward to the International Environmental Law class.  I took an Environmental Economics class in undergrad I really liked.   Here's a sketch I've been working on in my head.  It's closer to the truth than one might like to believe.  "The Unprepared Professor"  [Lights up on a classroom filled with students.  They're restless, looking at their watches, talking to each other.  PROFESSOR runs in, harried look on his face.  He stops at the front of the room and takes a deep breath.  He bangs on the desk a few times to get people to be quiet.  They get quiet.]  PROFESSOR Sorry I'm late.  I was working on something.  Something more important than class.  Sorry.  [He looks around, a little confused.]  Someone remind me... uh... what subject is this?  [He looks around the room, sees a few hands go up.  He's at a loss for words.]  PROFESSOR Let me get the seating chart.  [He pulls the seating chart out from under the desk.]  PROFESSOR Mr. Silverberg.  [No response.  The professor points in some general direction.]  PROFESSOR Mr. Silverberg.  [From the other side of the room, a girl speaks.]  GIRL You mean me?  Ms. Silverman?  PROFESSOR Yeah, sorry. Ms. Silverman.  GIRL This is Property.  PROFESSOR Yeah, yeah, now I remember.  What case did we stop at last time?  GIRL Rogers v. Big Empty Field.  PROFESSOR On page...?  GIRL 372.  [Professor flips open his book.  Looks at the page.  Scratches his head.  He has no idea.]  PROFESSOR Uh... let's take twenty seconds to... uh... remind ourselves what the case is about.  Everybody reread the case silently.  [He, like a man on a mission, speed-reads the page.  Flips.  Speed reads.  Flips.  Speed reads.  He's going as fast as he can.  But he realizes everyone's watching him.  He looks at his seating chart.]  PROFESSOR Ms. Chan?  [No response.  He points in a general direction.]  PROFESSOR Ms. Chan?  [From another part of the room, a guy talks]  GUY You mean me?  Mr. Cheng?  PROFESSOR Yeah.  [more confidently]  Yes.  Of course.  Go ahead, Mr. Cheng.  GUY Uh... go ahead with what?  YOU called on ME.  PROFESSOR Oh.  Sorry.  What was I....  Oh, yeah, the case.  Uh, just for the benefit of -- uh -- your classmates... tell me -- I mean US -- the facts of the case, as if you were speking to someone who'd never read the casebook.  Or any casebook.  And who wasn't really paying attention but was instead thinking about how his wife was in a really crappy mood this morning because it's that time of the month and I forgot our anniversary and she found the love letter I sent to my secretary.  The facts of the case, Mr. Choi.  GUY Mr. Cheng.  PROFESSOR Sure.  GUY Uh... in this case, Rogers sued the government over the Big Empty Field he claimed he had won in the land auction.  He sent a certified check to the Department of Land for seventeen thousand dollars, but then the National Guard attempted to evict him and his family.  PROFESSOR I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.  Could someone else repeat that?  [He points.]  You.  You in the shirt and pants.  GIRL 2 Me?  PROFESSOR Fine, whatever.  GIRL 2 Uh, he said that Rogers was suing --  PROFESSOR I'm sorry, did someone call on you?  GIRL 2 Yeah, you did.  PROFESSOR Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  GIRL 2 Rogers was suing the government for--  PROFESSOR And remind me what the question was that I asked.  GIRL 2 You just wanted me to repeat what he said.  PROFESSOR Yeah, yeah, gotcha.  Okay, go ahead.  GIRL 2 Okay.  Rogers sued the government for--  PROFESSOR You know, before we get to that, I'd like to see what everyone thinks about the decision in this case.  This is a fascinating case, really.  One of the few that, uh, the casebook editors decided to put in the casebook.  So it must be important.  I'd like to get a sense of what everyone thinks about it.  You know, in your heart, not necessarily what the law is.  Like you're talking to someone who has no idea what the law is.  Why don't we just go around the room.  Class is, what, an hour long?  [Guy calls out]  GUY An hour and a half.  PROFESSOR Well, we'll say today it's an hour.  And there are 60 of you, so that's one minute each.  We'll go around the room and everyone take one minute to say what you think about the decision.  We'll start with you -- [he points to someone]  -- whoever you are.  GUY 2 Well, I thought --  [Professor begins to head up the aisle and out of the room]  PROFESSOR And while you guys do that, I'll be -- uh -- in my office working on some other stuff.  Just leave whenever everyone's done or an hour is up... and I'm cancelling my office hours for later today.  If you need to speak to me, uh, I'll be around sometime next week probably.  Call my secretary at some point in the spring...  [Blackout.]

      Tonight at 9:00 on the History Channel: a two-hour documentary about Ronald Reagan.  The reason why I point this out is that I read something about it somewhere this afternoon ( urlLink www.tvtattle.com ) saying that it seems like it was originally written to be aired after Reagan dies (it's all in the past tense), but since he hasn't died yet they figured they'd air it anyway.  If I watch, I may be able to singlehandedly lower the average age of the viewers by a few years.

      Today in contracts, we were discussing a case where a contractor withheld a $7,000 payment to his subcontractor until he received assurance that the job would be completed.  The professor said, "you may wonder why they're suing when it's only $7,000, but you have to remember that $7,000 was a lot of money back then."  The case is from 1997.  Oops.

      "My Least Favorite Holiday"  There's a holiday coming up this weekend.  Everyone seems to be preparing for it.  But forget the turkey and cranberry sauce.  I'm talking about mail merges and cover letters.  December 1st.  Officially, it's "the day the National Association for Law Placement (NALP) says that 1L students and employers may initiate contact with each other regarding summer employment," but that's a little cumbersome, so I'd like to just call it "Frito-Lay Resume Day." (Because if it really was a holiday, I'm sure there'd be a corporate sponsor.)  We sometimes hear people complain about how long the Christmas season is, and how early people start preparing.  But Christmas is nothing compared to Frito-Lay Resume Day.  They've been preparing us for this since the moment we arrived in September.  With World of Law panels, letting us hear from lawyers at medium-sized firms focused on inter-jurisdictional litigation, or private public interest firms based in the mountain time zone who have business casual dress codes, or lawyers who work for non-governmental organizations closely affiliated with the Department of Agriculture.  Or unemployed lawyers looking to network with their peers and beg for jobs.  I actually can't speak with any authority regarding the World of Law panels.  I was too busy updating my resume to actually find the time to go.  (But I went to a couple of the law firm panel discussions.  Invariably, one of the lawyers would ask, "how many of you are 1Ls?"  And everyone's hand would go up.  That should have been an indication that these things were useless.  Well, not completely useless.  I ended up with a pen.  And some Pepperidge Farm goldfish.  So it was all worth it.)  We had the Public Interest orientation, where they gave out a 414-page book listing every job any lawyer ever got that pays less than $25,000 per year.  We had opportunities to meet with Fellows of all sorts - Public Interest Fellows, Christopher Columbus Langdell Fellows, Why-Didn't-I-Just-Hang-Up-On-The-Career-Services-Office-When-They-Called-Me Fellows.  Even Female Fellows.  However that's possible.  We had pre-introductory workshops to prepare us for the introductory workshops to prepare us for the actual workshops where they would tell us that they can't really tell us anything about finding a summer job.  And this was all before Gatorade Career Advising Day.  I mean November 1st.  The day they were allowed to stop having workshops to tell us they weren't really allowed to talk to us yet but under this or the other loophole, they were allowed to answer questions specifically about how many inches long your tie should be when going on an interview, but not whether you were allowed to double-knot your shoelaces.  Since Gatorade Career Advising Day, it's been a whirlwind of meetings and workshops designed to prepare us for Frito-Lay Resume Day.  Whirlwind is the wrong word.  I really mean "time-sucking monstrosity."  Take a typical recent week.  According to the online Career Events Calendar, there were 19 career-focused events one could attend.  Like the "Legal Smackdown" program featuring famous WWE wrestlers like Larry the Litigator and Pete the Probate Practitioner.  Resume workshops, brown-bag lunches with At-Least-They're-Letting-Me-Keep-The-Frequent-Flyer-Miles Fellows, World of Law: International Tariff panels, and, best of all, tours of the hallways on the third floor of Pound.  "To your left is the women's bathroom.  To your right are piles of binders listing every job everyone in the class of 1955 interviewed for.  Behind this secret panel is the closet where we keep the Attorney Advisors at night.  Under the floorboards is a copy of every resume we've ever seen.  Enjoy your search."  I finished my resume.  It looks like everyone else's, so I know it must be right.  I made sure to put that recommended "interests" line at the bottom.  "Interests: wearing dark suits, pretending to know what distinguishes your company from its competitors, and revising my resume."  I'm not quite done with my cover letter yet.  I thought I was done, but OCS told me I needed to spend some more time sucking every shred of personality out of it.  "I am a Harvard Law School student.  I like the law.  Please hire me.  You can reach me whenever you want, even at 3 a.m.  I'll be in the library, printing out more labels with law firm addresses on them."  Seriously, we've been here three months and already we have to look for a summer job.  Aren't we all here to avoid looking for jobs?  Isn't that the whole reason we went to law school?  I'm not ready to look for a job.  I want to go home and enjoy Thanksgiving without having to worry that all of my classmates have exhausted the world's supply of 9x12 envelopes.  Okay.  Back to my cover letters.  "Dear Taco Bell"

      From ESPN.com:  "The Boston Red Sox are expected to name a new general manager this week, with all signs pointing to the promotion of 28-year-old assistant GM Theo Epstein, ESPN's Peter Gammons reported. ... Epstein will be the youngest GM in baseball history, just ahead of Randy Smith, who was 29 when hired by the Padres in 1993."  When I was a college freshman, I remember noticing that there was a major league baseball player younger than I was.  And that pretty much ended any hope of that.  Now it looks like I've only got about 5 more years until there's a general manager younger than me too.  I guess after that the next set of people to look at will be the owners... and after that, I guess I'll just have to admit it's not gonna happen....

      Working on my Civil Procedure writing assignment.  He gave us a page-long scenario... "Ms. Atherlee has not been paying her rent... the lease contains a clause that says disputes are governed by Kansas law... Ms. Atherlee has never been to Kansas..." and some questions to answer... "Can she assert a defense for lack of personal jurisdiction...."  We have 1400 words to write, and a suggested time of 8-9 hours.  It's practice for the final exam.  And oh what fun....

       urlLink Washington Post article: "Harvard Mulls Offensive Speech Ban"  The Washington Post has an article about a proposed offensive speech code at the law school.  Frankly, if you read the article, you'll know as much as I do about this.  Apparently part of the offensive speech they're banning is actually telling the students about this.  News to me.  I can, however, point out an error in the article.  It says, "In the meantime, the school is also offering first-year students a new course to help them "manage difficult conversations" and learn how to speak with sensitivity on touchy issues such as race and gender."  Well, that's not really true.  They experimented by having one or two of the first-year sections (there are seven sections total) go through a two-hour workshop on this.  It's not a "course," it wasn't "offered" to anyone, and my section wasn't one of the ones picked, so I have nothing to say about the content.  The other thing they left out of the article is that on Monday night there was some sort of task force on diversity open meeting, and a bunch of professors spoke against any kind of speech code (that news courtesy of the Boston Globe -- not like I actually know what's going on here...).  Alan Dershowitz apparently said something like "I will not be silenced."  Good for you.  I don't know what else to say about this.  Personally, I haven't heard too much offensive speech here, so I don't know what the big deal is.... You can see this is an issue really close to my heart...

      More from the files of administrator stupidity.  I mentioned in a post a few days ago that we have to pick electives.  So there are about 30 choices on the "1L electives sheet," each with a number of slots available, and all 550 of us 1Ls have to rank our top 8 choices.  We can't pick anything that conflicts with our required classes.  So I went through the list, and discovered that about half the classes conflict with the required classes for my section.  That's ok, no big deal.  Out of curiosity, I looked to see if the other sections had it better or worse than my section.  And it turns out that all of the sections have the same timeslots filled with their required classes next semester.  OK.  So that means that half of the courses on the "1L electives sheet" can simply not be takem by a single 1L.  So the fact that there are, say 40 slots open in a class, is meaningless, because no one can choose it.  So the big fuss they made that since there are 1,350 slots for 550 students, so everyone will get a top choice, is really not the case at all.  Brilliant people at the registrar's office I guess.

      We got a Legal Citation assignment, 10% of our grade in the pass-fail writing class.  The instructor took the first few pages of a court brief and messed up the footnotes, and our assignment is to rewrite them correctly.  Fine.  Not a big deal.  On the bottom of the instructions page, he writes, "if you're interested in this topic, you can find the complete brief at [internet address]."  Uh, you mean the complete brief,  with all of the correct footnotes ???  Did he not realize that he was giving away the answers there?  I didn't look, because (a) the assignment is easy, and (b) come on, could someone really be desperate enough to cheat on this thing, worth 10% in a pass-fail class? and (c) I really feel bad for the professor because clearly he didn't intend to do this, and it wouldn't be right to take advantage of his carelessness.

      The Daily Show is interviewing some woman who wrote a book called "The Case Against Lawyers."  She says we have too many regulations, and so lawyers and legislators control the world because they control the rules that everyone has to follow, by being the only ones who get to make and interpret them.  She's saying the Court system is bad because the "making, manipulation, and selective enforcement of laws" is bad.  She says lawyers are only after money and power, and they're evil, and they're self-interested.  They're one day lobbying and the next day writing our laws, while the rest of us sit on the sidelines.  I say "they" like I'm not going to soon be one of them.

      I keep buying boxes of cereal, eating half of what's inside, and then getting sick of that cereal and buying something else.  The disadvantages of living alone on a dorm room.  No one to eat the rest of my cereal.  A few weeks ago I noticed a cereal on the supermarket shelf I'd never seen before -- Quisp.  Apparently it's a cereal from the '70s that Quaker recently brought back.  It tastes like Captain Crunch.  I don't like Captain Crunch.  My latest purchase is Life cereal.  I'm not sick of it.  Yet.  There's an article in The Onion this week (www.theonion.com) about a guy whose e-mails to his friends are too long.  Aw, he just needs a weblog.  :)

      Something more funny (I hope) than my essay below on the summer job search.  A sketch and song:  "1L Summer Job Hunt"  [Lights up outside Holmes Hall, nighttime.  6 students are bundled up in winter clothing, each wearing a backpack.  Student 1 looks at his watch.]  Student 1: 11:59.  Only one more minute till midnight.  Student 2: I can't wait.  Student 3: Yeah, I've been looking forward to this since September.  Student 4: Ten seconds.  [They count down together]  All students: 10 - 9 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 3 - 2 - 1 - ZERO!  [They're very excited!]  Student 1: It's December First!!  Student 2: Now we can apply for summer jobs!!  Student 3: I'm so excited!  [They open their backpacks and pull out stacks of manila envelopes.  One student tries to open to the door to Holmes, to get into the mail center.]  Student 4: It's locked!  Student 5: Don't worry!  I stole the guy's key ring during lunch yesterday and made a copy!  No one's gonna get their resumes to the firms before us!  [He starts to unlock the door.]  Student 2: How many envelopes have you got there?  Student 3: Sixty.  How about you?  Student 2: Sixty-three.  Student 3: [trying not to show his disappointment]  Well, this is only the first batch.  [Student 1 takes off his winter coat to reveal that he is wearing a suit.]  Student 6:  Why are you wearing a suit?  Student 1: I have an interview with Milbank at 12:10.  Student 6: Tonight?  Student 1: Yeah.  Unfortunately someone had already taken the midnight slot. I'd better run.  [Student 1 exits.]  Student 6: That sucks.  Student 4: Yeah.  I'm really worried.  My first interview isn't until tomorrow.  After lunch.  Student 3: After lunch?  But by then all the jobs will be taken.  Student 4: That's what I'm worried about.  [Student 2 pulls out his cell phone and starts dialing.  He motions for everyone else to quiet down.]  Student 2: Shhh.  I'm on the phone. [he talks into the phone]  Yes. Shearman and Sterling?  Hi.  I'm a 1L at Harvard and I was wondering if I could set up an interview.  [pause]  Yes, I realize it's just after midnight.  But it's December 1.  [pause]  I realize that.  But it's the first day that 1Ls can try to get summer jobs, and so I figured. [pause] Oh, the hiring partner will give me a phone interview right now?  That's great!  [As soon as the other students hear that, they all take out their phones and start dialing.]  Student 3: O'Melveny and Myers.  Speed dial number 7.  Student 6: [into his phone] Hello?  My grandfather is Mr. Cromwell.  Student 5: [into his phone] Do you have Mr. Cravath's home number?  Yes, I realize it's late..  [Student 2 hangs up his phone, excited.]  Student 2: I got a callback!  I've got to get to Logan to make the red-eye for my 4 AM interview!  [They all begin to sing // to the tune of: "Higher" by Creed]  When reading I'm dreaming 'bout another world A world where I get paid At sunrise I want to be at interviews And talk about the law and all about myself 'Cause there's a hunger, a longing for the good life Fulfilling all the dreams I've had since was four  I'll make partner Then I'll find me a life I will make partner Then I'll buy me a wife  I can finally get hired So my law career can start I can finally get hired Because I am really smart  It's easy when firms are falling over To try and talk to second-years but I am not quite there Cause first year, they say that it's a challenge But I am gonna be the first one, who's hired for the year First step towards the White House And first step towards my future monarchy  I'll make partner After my third heart attack I will make partner And buy my wife a new rack  I can finally get hired At a firm where rates are high I can finally get hired Work like mad until I die  I'll make partner, partner I will make partner I will partner some day  In suits I feel like I'm alive for the very first time With dictionaries, photocopies, Westlaw searches, lunches with the boss All that I'm learning in FYL will soon pay off  I can finally get hired Doors are opening, let me through I can finally get hired Legal research is what I'm meant to do I can finally get hired All my loans be reimbursed I can finally get hired Just after midnight, it's December first

      In Criminal Law today, we were talking about a case where the police were searching the scene of a shooting and saw some stereo equipment they thought might be stolen, and turned the equipment over to check the serial numbers.  The justification they gave was that nice stereo equipment didn't seem to fit in an otherwise poorly-outfitted apartment.  But, as one guy in my section said -- and it's the funniest thing anyone has said in class all semester, by far -- that would be "stereo-"typing.  Ha.

      I chose my elective for next semester this afternoon.  Had to rank my top 8 choices.  Because each class only has a few open spots, and there are 550 1Ls who have to fit in all these classes.  It was hard to find 8 courses to rank that I wanted to take, which is not a good sign for next year and the year after, when all of my classes are electives and the choices are not much larger.

      I watched the new Behind the Music: Matchbox Twenty on VH1 last night and then listened to the new Matchbox Twenty album on vh1.com (I sound like an advertisement... sorry...).  I'd like to make a prediction that their song, "The Difference," which, as far as I'm aware has not been released as a single, will be released as a single and be a pretty big hit.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album didn't impress me that much.

      Nothing really interesting happened today.  So I'm searching for something to post.  I sent an e-mail to a friend this morning regarding my thoughts on school vs. work and the on-campus recruiting process.  Maybe some of that would be interesting to anyone reading this.  So here's some thoughts, based on the admittedly limited experience and perspective I've got.  My advice -- from my limited and narrow experience -- would be that before you take a job, make sure you understand the day-to-day work you will have and what they really envision you doing. My other advice is that on-campus recruiting is not the be-all and end-all of the employment world.  There are other jobs out there -- and the jobs that *don't* come to campus to recruit people are perhaps in many cases much better jobs.  My reasoning -- and this kind of makes sense, I guess -- there's a reason why some companies have to come to campus and woo people and make it really easy for people to take their jobs, and some companies that don't.  Companies that come to campus need to do that because all else being equal, no one wants their jobs.  If nobody came to campus, students would go out and find enjoyable, fulfilling jobs because they'd have to go searching regardless.  But these smart companies that have crappy jobs to offer need to come and intercept -- before you find the good jobs -- and snatch up students, making it as easy as possible for them to say yes and not think about what they really want out of a job.    I know I'm ignoring the flip-side of the argument, which is that these companies really need people while the ones that don't come just don't need as many young people right out of school.  But my response to that line of reasoning is that there's a reason they need more people -- because everyone quits and leaves when they realize how crappy the job is.    I don't think it's as extreme as I'm pretending it is, though.  I'm sure there are lots of good matches people can find between what they want and what's being offered.  Just remember you're gonna be there 40+ hours a week, so make sure you like the people and you like the work before you give them half your waking hours.  As far as working vs. going right to grad school -- it's pretty clear here who's right from undergrad and who took some time inbetween (although I'm wrong sometimes when I try to guess).  Seeing what's out there besides school, even just for a year -- seems to give people a little bit of perspective, and helps them realize that school isn't everything, that they can function in the real world, that they're employable, that the world doesn't revolve around them, and they appreciate that school is easier and more fun than working.  Not so much that schoolwork is easier than workwork, but that the school lifestyle is easier than the work lifestyle -- it's very hard to do much besides work when you're working all day.  Your energy is low, there aren't "extracurricular" activities floating around, you don't have forced opportunities to interact with lots of people... it makes you have to try harder to do stuff.  Maybe people here who came straight through don't try as hard to make themselves happy and fulfilled as people who had some outside experience, if that makes any sense.  I'm not really basing this on anything except my intuition, but it seems like maybe they're more content to be stressed and unhappy and insane.  And it's no fun dealing with stressed unappy insane people who can't put things into perspective and realize they're lucky to be here, they've pretty much guaranteed a decent future by being here, and law school can be a lot of fun if you let it.   The scariest thing about working was that it's so easy not to do anything else besides work and eat and sleep.  It took a bigger effort than I expected for me to fill up my spare time fulfillingly and not just busily.  I found people to eat with, and occassionally do other stuff with, but it seemed like "doing things" became more special than it should have been, and instead of the default being to do something, the default became to go home and maybe try to write, or maybe watch TV, or maybe go to the supermarket, or maybe go to sleep.  Which I didn't like.  The best thing about being here is that it's so much easier to do stuff -- there's more time, and there's more stuff.  I don't know what the point I'm trying to make here is, I'm sorry -- I forgot where I was headed. Just to basically say that school is good after not school for a while because you realize how much there is to do and how easy it is to do it.  Whew, that's a whole bunch of text.  Hope it's kind of helpful and interesting... or if not, hope you'll still come back tomorrow and see if I post something better and funnier.

      An all new Saturday Night Live soon.  I always root for saturday Night Live to be bad and not funny.  It makes me feel better about myself if I can confidently say that I can do just as well as their writers can.  And since it usually sucks, I find that watching it becomes my self-esteem boost for the week.

      Giving Thanks for Thanksgiving Break  For many of us 1Ls, Thanksgiving break next week may be the first time well see our families since starting law school.  For me, one of the most common questions my family asks me about law school is, so what exactly are you learning?  (The other most common questions Im asked by my family include, are you eating enough vegetables? have you met a nice Jewish girl yet? and have you figured out a way for me to get out of that felony murder charge?  My uncle Elmer.  Hes got some problems.)  Usually, I just respond to the question about what Im learning by saying some big complicated words Ive heard in some of my classes.  For example: Im learning a lot, Grandma.  I now know that given the precedent set in the landmark case of promissory estoppel v. appellate restitution, the jurisdiction of the exclusionary rule is intentional infliction of emotional distress.  But only if the action is brought in a federal district court in reliance on the expectancy nudum pactum de novo res judicata assumpsit. That usually shuts people up pretty quickly.  However, Ive recently begun to wonder if I am in fact learning anything useful, or at least anything useful for Thanksgiving conversation.  Ive already thought of a few good lines Ill hopefully be able to use at the dinner table.  Like when my little cousin throws up on the floor, I can exclaim that he was simply performing a restitution remedy and disgorging the benefit the festive meal had conferred upon him.  Or when my aunt throws out the burnt sweet potatoes, I can gently warn her that even under the fourth amendment, her trash can be searched without a warrant, and the whole world will know she cant cook.  But more seriously, I wonder if theres anything substantive Ive picked up in eleven weeks of law school.  And when I really think about, I realize that there is quite a bit Ive learned.  Ive learned that highlighters dont last very long.  Ive learned that getting called on in class isnt as scary as it first seemed.  Ive learned that you can always read more carefully.  And Ive learned that for every argument on one side of a policy issue, theres four counter-arguments, two counter-counter-arguments, and one random aside into the world of ancient Greek mythology.  Ive noticed law school has started to make me think differently.  I send e-mails where my points are numbered: the movie was (1) a dramatic masterpiece, (2) with stirring performances by (a) the pretty blond girl, (b) the overly-precocious child, and (c) the giraffe, but (3) I was distracted by the German subtitles.  For the first time, Im mindful of promises made without bargained-for consideration: I promise Ill meet you by the Harkboxes at noon.  But youd better give me a dollar, just so we can be sure weve got an enforceable contract.  Yes, of course Ill give you back the dollar.  Not!  Ive started to recognize the opinions of certain Supreme Court justices: well, the rhetorical flourishes in the first section make me think its Justice Jackson, but the wavering between federal and state common law smells a lot like Justice Ginsburg. And, finally, the most dangerous knowledge of all, Ive begun to actually recognize the names of law firms: White and Blue.  Yes, I know them very well.  They specialize in international export law, yes?  And the esteemed firm of Chance, Luck, and Happenstance.  World leaders in capital markets and currency law. Fascinating firm.  My family thinks its pretty cool Im at law school.  Frankly, so do I.  I think its pretty cool that last week in Civil Procedure, we had to read page 1000 of our casebook.  Lets turn to page one thousand and four is something I never thought Id hear anyone say.  I think its pretty cool that three months ago I would have said that UCC was some fringe cable network (the United Cheese Channel?  the Urban Cinema Channel?  the (always-exciting) University Choir Channel?) and now I know that it stands for the Unenforceable Contract Channel, and, without looking, I know that UCC 2-205 refers to firm offers.  (But please dont ask me what a firm offer is!)  Valuable knowledge?  Maybe not.  But enough to impress my relatives at the Thanksgiving table.  Ill be sure to tell my grandmother that Im eating lots of vegetables (well, lots of one vegetable, anyway  it always seems be squash week at the Hark).  And maybe that nice Jewish girl will give me a call.  I'll make sure to keep her away from Uncle Elmer.

      I should be working on my memo, but instead I'm having "fun with math" -- here's something stupid I just discovered while looking at the course schedule list regarding the electives we can take -- all of the sections have pretty much the same time blocks filled with required classes next semester.  Yet on our list of elective choices are a whole bunch of classes that fall into those slots.  So the "list of 1L electives" included classes nobody can possibly take.  And yet the available slots in those classes are counted in the total number of available elective slots, meaning that instead of 550 students to choose from 1350 total slots for spring courses, it's really only about 1000 slots.  Hence they make us choose our top 8 elective choices.  Because some people may get choice #8.  Ick.

      I got back my first legal writing memo today.  It's pass/fail.  I passed, along with everyone else.  Phew, what a relief.  In the comments section, there's a comment: "your issue #1 could use some more analysis" followed a comment section later with "you do an especially nice job of analyzing issue #1."  I felt like I was reading a course review.  :)

      I had lunch with one of my professors this afternoon.  He's been taking groups of 6 students out each week, and this was the week I'd signed up for.  Mostly I'm just awed by the professors here, and it's really cool that this professor in particular has made it part of his routine to go to lunch with his students.  So it was 6 of us and this Civil Procedure professor -- he's 70 years old, has been at Harvard a long, long time, and in class he's super-sharp, and really quite funny.  And we basically were all in awe of him the whole time, he was telling us how of the people he keeps in touch with from his law school class (here, class of '54 I think), one was a U.S. Senator, two were law school deans... he asked us how we like law school so far... I don't know that I said more than three words the entire two hours we were out, but I was content just to listen and absorb.  Cool experience.  The funny anecdote I'm getting to is at the end of the lunch -- it was a Chinese lunch buffet -- the guy sitting next to me opens his fortune cookie, and the fortune says: "If you make a promise to give someone something, keep it."  Read that again, please.  Obviously it means keep the promise, not keep the something -- but what a poor choice of words...  And you're probably thinking, "Now wait a second.  He goes to lunch with a professor and the best anecdote he's got is about a fortune cookie."  Yeah, that's the best I can do.  Actually, here's something else kind of funny -- so we all went up to the buffet once and took some food, and then it became what could perhaps have seemed like a contest of wills to see who'd make the first move to go back and get more food.  And nobody did.  It's cool, because we were all engaged and listening to the professor, but I thought it was interesting that no one (including me, of course) had the guts (guts isn't the word I'm looking for... I don't know what is though...) to get up and get more food.  But still, lunch was really cool.

      We had a negotiation workshop today.  They told us what it means to negotiate.  The guy teaching it said "I give this lecture to kids ranging from elementary school all the way up to adults."  The same lecture I bet.  This was really boring.  He spoke for about 20 minutes, then we had a negotiation exercise with a partner -- not worth going into detail -- and then we come back from that thinking it's almost over and he says, "now I'll just talk for another 40 minutes and then you can go."  Great.  At the end he said, "I'm sure this is way too much information for any of you to grasp."  Yeah, because we're seven years old.  What we learned: (1) negotiation is when two sides bargain to come to an agreement, (2) you can be nice or you can be nasty about it, and both tactics have plusses and minuses, and (3) talking about negotiation is really boring.  The funniest part of his whole lecture was at the beginning he mentioned that there's a negotiation class we can choose to take in the spring as our elective, but this is just a sample.  What I heard that to mean was it was a 90-minute infomercial for the negotiation class.  And a very unsuccessful one at that.  No one's gonna take his class.  He'll be negotiating for his job.  And then he'll be negotiating with pedestrians for spare change...

      I ran into a girl across the hall from me a little while ago who asked me if the noise last night kept me up.  I asked her what noise she meant.  She said she and some friends were playing loud music and screaming in the hallway between 4 and 6 in the morning.  I kind of remember hearing something in the middle of the night,but if it woke me up I fell right back asleep... so I told her I didn't really notice.  And she told me it woke my next-door neighbor up, and she went out in the hall and asked them all to be quiet.  But apparently I slept right through.  My question is: what the heck are people doing making noise in the hallway -- what are people even doing awake?!? -- at 4 in the morning?  Maybe this is why people think law school is hard.  If you're gonna be up at 4 in the morning, just staying awake the next day is going to be hard, let alone reading and thinking.  I just don't understand...

       urlLink Click this link   Unbelievable.  For $100,000,000, you can name the Harvard Law School Library.  Which, by the way, already has a name.  But I guess Mr. Langdell, the founder of the notion of the modern law school (or so they tell us), isn't really that important.  This kind of stuff is what gives lawyers a bad name.  Or maybe it's the kind of stuff that gives ivy league universities a bad name.  I don't know.  Either way, I think it's absurd.

      Another week, another column draft:  Evaluating the Course Evaluations  I was excited to read in the Advisor last week: 1Ls will be able to submit their elective course selections via the Web on Mon., Nov. 18, from 9 a.m. until Thurs., Nov. 21, at 12 p.m.  An elective!  Exciting!  So many choices!  But unfortunately, all of them are about the law.  Having no idea what I want to take, my first reaction was to check the online Course Evaluation Guide and see whats gotten good reviews in the past.  The first evaluation I clicked on was very helpful: Students generally liked [the professor]. Four students found him clear. Other students said [he] was not clear (4).  Very informative.  Clearly, the Course Evaluation Guide has modeled itself after the Zagats guide to restaurants.  The food was good, but bad.  Service was lightning-quick, but painfully slow.  I was delighted, but poisoned.  I read another review: positive comments [about the casebook] ranged from good, well-edited, and challenging, to fine, relevant unclear, horrible, boring, unorganized, the worst, impenetrable, and too complex.  Ah, yes.  The more adjectives, the better.  I was also disappointed at some of the math in the course reviews: [t]welve students commented that the casebook was bad and poorly edited (8).  But perhaps those course reviews were tabulated by the students referred to here, regarding another course: [a]s for prerequisites, one student recommended second-grade math, while another suggested fourth-grade algebra.  The course was Family Law.  No, Im kidding.  But, seriously, did we really learn algebra in fourth grade?  Must have been a private school   It was nice to see agreement about the value of course materials: [s]tudents seemed to blame [the professors] power point presentations (11) [a] significant number of students did find [the professors] power point presentations helpful (10).  In another review, [s]ome students stated that the casebook was poorly edited, poorly organized, and not great. Other students found the book good and decent.  Wonderful.  Some students apparently used their course reviews to show off their knowledge of obscure vocabulary words: [o]ne student called the course unnecessarily obfuscatory.  In another review, [o]ne student described [the professor] as baroque in his formulation of the issues.  Yet another student described a professor as a pedagogical trainwreck.  I was perhaps most amused by the following excerpt from a review: [t]wo students declared that they would love to have [the professor] as [their] grandfather. A minority dissented. They found him confusing, unable to bring students to the point, and grating.  Grandfatherly qualities indeed.  What was truly baffling about the course reviews was the lack of agreement regarding how the course was taught.  Given the options  Socratic, no passing, Socratic, passing allowed, Voluntary participation, Group/panel asked to prepare, and Lecture, one would think it would be fairly easy to get a consensus from the reviews as to how each class is taught.  But we are not so lucky.    For one class, 22 students said the class had voluntary participation, and 58 said group/panel asked to prepare.  Can there really be that much confusion between the two?  For another course, 66 said it was Socratic, no passing, and 54 said passing was allowed.  With two students, who apparently were never called on, insisting it was voluntary participation.  Huh?    One of the more baffling splits was a full five-category spread  10 for Socratic, no passing, 41 for passing allowed, 17 for voluntary participation, 2 claimed a group/panel was asked to prepare, and 37 chose lecture.  If you cant even get this question right, how can you even think about the final exam?  Odder still was a class that 99 students said was Socratic, no passing.  Seems pretty clear.  Yet 2 students said passing was allowed, 2 said it was voluntary participation, and 1 said it was a lecture.  I dont want any of those five students in my study group.  My favorite comment seemed truly out of left field: [s]tudents felt that [the professor should avoid bashing the South (3).  The conclusion I draw from reading all of these course evaluations is that the evaluations need an evaluation of their own.  Because while theyre comprehensive and organized, theyre also contradictory, confusing, and utterly useless.  The proliferation of quotation marks makes them difficult to read.  In sum, theyre good, bad, long, short, clear, unclear, unnecessarily obfuscatory, baroque in their formulation of the issues, and grandfatherly.  Maybe Ill just cross-register.

      A Parody of the disco song "What Is Love" that I wrote for the a capella group which they probably (and justifiably!) won't use:  What is law Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more  Oh, baby don't sue me  Don't sue me no more   What is law  Yeah   Oh, you sued me, in District Court  But I want to have, the case removed to the state  Which law is right, which law is wrong  Gimme a rule   What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more  What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more   Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh  Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh   You win if we, apply state law But federal law, I will come out on top  We can't decide, the judge don't know  What can we do   What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more  What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more   Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh  Whoa whoa whoa, oooh oooh   What is law, oooh, oooh, oooh  What is law, oooh, oooh, oooh   What is law  Oh baby, don't sue me  Don't sue me no more   Don't sue me  Don't sue me   I read State v.

      Went to a "public interest student job fair" today, where students who worked at public interest firms sat at tables to answer people's questions.  Good concept, poor execution.  They should have given out background on each job first, or some handouts -- because the only question you could ask would be "uh... what did you, uh... DO?"  And most of the jobs were so specific and targeted towards a certain narrow group of people -- "International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda," "Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch," "US Attorney, Western District of Missouri," "Farmworker Legal services of New York," "AARP Foundation Litigation" -- that I didn't really feel interested  enough  to actually go up and start a conversation.  The level of interest needed to get people to potentially rope themselves into a ten-minute conversation they don't want to be in is too high -- if they had more printed material, or it was a forum where each person got up and gave a short speech and then hung around for questions... I don't know, that may have worked better.  At least they had some free food.  Not enough for dinner though.

      I spent an hour tonight working on my resume in preparation for a 20-minute meeting tomorrow morning with an advisor in the Office of Career Services.  Basically, they prefer that all resumes are the same and that everyone is very boring.  Corporate law firms like to hire boring people without personalities or interests because that means they won't mind spending 21 hours a day at the office working.  Not that I want to work for a corporate law firm, but still.  I have my answer prepared for when they say something like, "an employer doesn't want to see this stuff about you writing things."  My answer: "then I don't think I want to work for them."  And that's not as flip an answer as it sounds -- I don't think it's terrible to want to work for an employer who is looking for someone to do the kinds of things I want to do.  If what they want is a legal research slave, that's great -- but it's not the job I want, so why should I have to make my resume look like I do.  I want a job that uses my passions and skills, not that ignores them.  Something else that bothers me -- they want you to shunt everything non-law related into a catch-all category called "Interests."  I think that's idiotic and demeaning.  "Reading" is an interest.  But if someone, I don't know, wrote a book, or performed in the Olympics, or anything real and substantial, that's an activity, a livelihood, an accomplishment.  Calling it an interest minimizes it and relegates it to second-class status.  I don't like that.    I'll post tomorrow after my meeting, to say whether or not I got to use my prepared answer.  I'm betting I will.

      My law school fantasy basketball team got crushed this week.  5 categories lost, 2 categories won, 1 tie.  Dismal performance by these players whose names I don't know.  Fantasy baseball was more fun, since I actually had some idea what was going on.  Election day tomorrow.  Up here, apparently it's a super-close race for governor between Mitt Romney and Shannon O'Brien.  The negative ads are funny.  Mitt Romney's ad director has gone out of his way to find the most unflattering pictures of Shannon O'Brien -- in the middle of chewing some food, hunched over... she could pass for Ted Kennedy's twin sister.  And Shannon O'Brien's latest ad features some random senior citizen saying something like, "I met Mitt Romney once, and he was mean to me.  Don't vote for Mitt Romney.  He hates old people."  Wonderful stuff.  My prediction is O'Brien will win.  I have no factual basis for this prediction.

      Law School Mad Libs!  Fun for the whole family!  Without peeking at the story below, choose each the following: (Celebrity Last Name #1) (Celebrity Last Name #2) (State) (Adjective) (Person you dislike) (Place you don't want to go) (Date) (Deviant Activity #1) (Deviant Activity #2) (Celebrity Last Name #3) (Celebrity Last Name #4) (Deviant Activity #3) (Number) (Plural Noun) (Activity) (Celebrity Last Name #5) (Celebrity Last Name #6) (Deviant Activity #4) (Action, present tense - ex: bake cookies, run up the stairs) (Adjective) (Another adjective) (Another plural noun) (Number) (a family member) (Deviant Activity #5) (Deviant Activity #6)   Now insert the words in the story below:  This is the case of (Celebrity Last Name #1) v. (Celebrity Last Name #2) in the (State) (Adjective) Court, on appeal from Judge (Person you dislike)'s court in (Place you don't want to go).  On (Date), the Plaintiff alleges that he/she entered into a contract with the Defendant.  The plaintiff promised to (Deviant Activity #1) in exchange for the defendant promising to (Deviant Activity #2).  The question before the court is whether (Deviant Activity #2) served as sufficient consideration to create a binding contract.    In the case of (Celebrity Last Name #3) v. (Celebrity Last Name #4), the court ruled that the plaintiff's promise to (Deviant Activity #3) was in fact sufficient consideration to support a payment by the defendant of (Number) dollars and three (Plural Noun).  However, the judge insisted that because of unequal (Activity) skills, the contract was void on public policy grounds.  Conversely, in the case of (Celebrity Last Name #5) v. (Celebrity Last Name #6), the court ruled that the plaintiff's promise to (Deviant Activity #4) was made in bad faith, and could not support the defendant's promise to (Action, present tense) every day for the rest of his life.  In the case before us, we hold that the contract is (adjective), but unfortunately is in violation of the (Another adjective) Evidence rule and the Statute of (Another plural noun).  Our judgment is supported by the (Number) restatement on contracts, written by (a family member) while (Deviant Activity #5).  Case dismissed.  Time for Justices to (Deviant Activity #6).

      In Criminal Law, we're switching from learning substantive criminal law to criminal procedure, so we use a new casebook.  I had bought a used copy of this casebook at the bookstore, and I remember thinking it wouldn't be a big deal because only a small section of the book is written in.  Sure enough, it's the pages we have to read from now until thanksgiving that are marked up.  As I started reading today, I was holding out hope that the former owner's margin notes would be perhaps marginally useful -- but about three-fourths the way down the first page we have to read, after the book says "some regulation of policing is essential to a free society," in the margin, this person wrote "regulation good because otherwise people crazy."   Yes, clearly this will be very useful... oh well.

      Solitaire  The black nine on the red ten.  Dont you see it?  No, dont give up, no, NO!  You can win this one.  To the left, to the left.  Look at the column.  Its right there.  NO!  Ive found that its very hard to telepathically communicate solitaire moves to the person sitting in front of me, no matter how hard I try.  I pretend to take the moral high ground by refusing to play games on my laptop in class.  Instead, I watch everyone else.  Its become part of the sights and sounds of the classroom.  The clickety-clack of laptop keys.  The message on the blackboard about this afternoons symposium on Law and Cauliflower in the Ropes-Gray room.  The kid down the row from me peeing in his pants every time his name is called.  And the solitaire.  Well, not just solitaire.  Hearts.  Minesweeper.  Snood.  Games where you shoot colored squares as they fall down from the sky.  Games where you catch colored circles as they rise up to the sky.  In criminal law, I see people playing first-person shooting games.  Next semester in property, I imagine Ill see people playing Sim City.  Perhaps in the sports law class, people play NHL Hockey.  Id hate to imagine what subject-appropriate games people play in tax law.  And in feminist legal theory, perhaps everyone just watches porn.   Its hard not to watch the screens.  Its impossible not to get mesmerized by the cards falling like springs when your neighbor wins at solitaire.  Impossible not to marvel at the ability of some people to simultaneously play pinball and answer a professors question, without missing a flip of the flipper or a precedent case cited.  Impossible not to wonder why we feel the need to keep ourselves otherwise entertained even while were sitting in the classroom being taught by some of the smartest people in the world.  I dont know whether its our fault or the professors fault that its hard to stay focused.  Even without playing games, I find things to steal my attention away.  I change the colors on my screen.  I spell-check.  I use Microsoft Words autotext feature to create time-saving abbreviations while I take notes.  My computer now automatically turns sc into Supreme Court.  It turns tjur into territorial jurisdiction.  My personal favorite is that oms immediately turns into objective manifestation of subjective intent.  Thirty-seven letters saved.  Used it twenty-four times in one contracts class.  The distractions make computers a curse as well as a blessing.  Sure, they let us take more notes more quickly, more organized and easier to read  relieving us from having to decode our hurried scribbles when we go back over the pages (is this a reference to UCC section 2-207, or my professors office phone number?)  but they also give us dozens of ways to keep from paying attention.    I genuinely feel guilty whenever I lose focus and start changing my font or making the text blink.  I feel like its ridiculous that I cant force myself to concentrate for an hour and a half  especially since much of whats happening in the classroom is genuinely interesting, or at least useful.  I start to wonder if its a function of technology having made our expectations too high  television and computers and video games and cell phones and microwave ovens.  (Microwave ovens?  Maybe not.)  Constant stimulation.  Overkill.    I see commercials for cell phones that let you check e-mail, play games, send text messages, surf the Web, store your daily schedule, and do long division.  Isnt simply being able to talk on the phone enough?  And if were used to our gadgets and gizmos doing eight things at once, I guess were used to our brains functioning like that as well.  So a professor talking just isnt enough.  We need solitaire and minesweeper and pinball and Warcraft III (I did research to find that one) as well.  It almost makes me wish we didnt have technology at all.  That we didnt grow up with all this stuff to distract us.  That laptops didnt come with solitaire.  That simply listening to the professor would be enough.  Almost.  But Im writing this during class.  So who am I to talk.

      From the hypothetical press kit, for a hypothetical upcoming Broadway show, "Trent Lott: The Musical"  Born in Mississippi in 1941, the son of a sharecropper farmer turned shipyard worker and a school teacher, Trent Lott has lived a storybook life.  That storybook, however, was written in 1825.    From the highest of highs -- serving as Senate majority leader -- to the lowest of lows -- forced to resign his leadership post and serve merely as Chairman of the Senate Rules Committee -- Trent Lott: The Musical tells a uniquely American tale of a man undone by the most tempting of all temptations, making a toast at a birthday for a hundred-year-old man.    It's a story we've seen time and time again -- recall Thomas Jefferson, impeached from the presidency after saying "I never should have written that darn Declaration -- all hail the King of England" at Benjamin Franklin's 100th birthday party; recall Charlie Chaplin, buried alive after saying "the world would have been better off if we'd never added sound to movies" at Bob Hope's 100th birthday party; and recall Derek Jeter, stripped of his World Series rings after saying "I wish I was on the Red Sox" at George Steinbrenner's 100th birthday party.    But none as riveting as the story of Senator Lott, who suffered not only the indignity of losing his Senate leadership post, but also of losing his spacious Capitol Hill office overlooking the Washington Monument in favor of a slightly less spacious office in the Hart Senate Office Building overlooking the Jefferson Memorial.    This uniquely American musical traces the rise of Trent Lott from a sharecropper's son, to Senate Majority Leader, to husband of actress Halle Berry. (Note that some details of Mr. Lott's life have been altered to enhance the drama)

      Inspired to write a song about the holidays.  It's not about law school.  Thankfully.  Finally.  It's a ballad.  :)  A little unfocused, but it's just a first draft.  Of something.  At least it's not about law school.  :)  As we put away the presents As we take apart the tree* Say goodbye to wrapping paper Say goodbye to family  As we finish all the cookies Cut the final piece of cake Close our eyes and picture snowfall On the ground when we awake  It's another year gone quickly As the time is flying by I can't freeze these memories But I can try  (chorus) I don't want to face uncertain future Not when now has turned out not so bad I don't want to find out that I'm living In the best days of the life I will have had.  As the snowman melts to water As the leftovers are gone As there's no more sharing stories Stay up talking until dawn  As the years pass bonds are broken People go their separate ways Suddenly it's been a lifetime Made of long-forgotten days  It's another set of moments That are passing through the air Once they've slipped through our fingers They're no longer there  (chorus) I don't want to face uncertain future Not when now has turned out not so bad I don't want to find out that I'm living In the best days of the life I will have had.  (bridge) I never used to realize when you grow up you're still who you are inside That there's no switch that turns you from a child to a man There's no beacon of direction, there's no light that shines the way Everyone's just out there doing what he can  (chorus) I don't want to face uncertain future Not when now has turned out not so bad I don't want to find out that I'm living In the best days of the life I will have had.  *Is "take apart" the right verb for what you do with a Christmas tree when you're done with it.  "Unscrewing the electric bulbs from the menorah" doesn't have the same song-feeling, so I'm an honorary Christian for the purposes of writing the song...

      Just saw a commercial for "High School Reunion" (yes, I'm watching way too much WB... but I kind of like the show "Everwood" for no articulable reason), a show that takes 17 people who graduated from high school 10 years ago and flies them to Hawaii to re-live old conflicts and make good dramatic reality TV.  On the website, they label each person -- "The Bully," "The Bitchy Girl," "The Loner."  Why, why, why, why, why would anyone agree to be on a show like this?  Is the week of fame they'll have before the show is cancelled really worth being forever known as "The Bitchy Girl?"  The next commercial was for "The Surreal Life," another reality show, where 7 B-list celebrities live together Real World-style.  Corey Feldman, Gabrielle Carteris (from Beverly Hills 90210), and 5 others.  This one I guess I understand why these people would agree to do this -- they've already been semi-famous once, and they miss it.  And it's a paycheck.  Imagine combining the two shows -- B-list celebrities at a high school reunion.  I wonder what Pamela Anderson was like in high school. Did she even go to high school?  And what do her high school classmates think of her now?  Too many reality shows.  Eventually they'll run out of people to put on these shows.  There'll be a reality show with a cameraman roaming the streets in search of people who haven't been on reality shows.  And they won't find any.

      I watched the TV show "Do Over" on the WB on Thursday night.  Been meaning to catch an episode because the concept is cool, and something I've thought would be a cool gimmick for a screenplay or a tv show, done well -- adult, through some unexplained accident, gets to go back in time and re-live high school, knowing what he knows as an adult.  Could be really good.  This sitcom, however, wasn't.  Instead of using the concept to create interesting dilemmas for the character -- save someone from heading down a road he knows leads to disaster at the cost of affecting your own future negatively? -- this show's writers used it purely as an excuse to have the character say one-liners that are funny to him but no one else knows what he's talking about.  "Oh -- look how stupid the son of Vice President Bush is.  He'll never amount to anything."  "I wouldn't be so sure."  One of the subplots of the episode I saw was the kid turns in the Nirvana song "Smells Like Teen Spirit" as a poetry class assignment, and the teacher gets concerned.  What a waste of a good concept.  Kind of like the movie "Galaxy Quest."  Cool idea.  But the execution totally wasted the potential.

      E-Mails and Outlines  The hardest thing about being home for break has been not getting nearly as much e-mail as usual.  I really like getting e-mail.  It makes me feel like someone is thinking of me, even if its just a faceless organization or a company seeking to help me either lower my interest rate, lose weight fast, or get cheap prescription drugs.  Like the woman who sends out the e-mails every Thursday telling us that the Adviser is available to read online.  I really love those e-mails.  I missed getting it this past Thursday.  I guess there are no new administrative announcements regarding a special holiday-themed resume workshop, or a clinical project helping the unfortunately-injured sue the city for not clearing the snow away fast enough.  There were a couple of days this week I didnt get any e-mail at all.  One day I actually sent myself a test message to make sure my e-mail was still working.  It was.  Of course.  I was a bit disturbed by the news that Harvard will now be virus-checking our e-mails.  Not actually disturbed that theyll be virus-checking, but just that they werent before.  Did it bother anyone else that on the first day they virus-checked they caught 175 infected e-mails?  I dont know how many e-mails are sent every day on the Harvard system  none to me that day (see, I can make my paragraphs flow together so well)  but 175 seems not completely insignificant.  If they starting checking the students for viruses and found 175 of us were infected with something, it would be pretty big news.  I guess e-mail is different.  The snowstorm in the Northeast this week forced me to actually sit down and study (Im at home in New York).  Its ironic that in elementary school, the snow means you dont have to do any work.  Home from law school with exams looming, it means you have no choice but to.  At least its miserable outside.  Ive been trying to incent myself to study by lavishly rewarding myself for each bit of work done.  For every thirty seconds I study, I get to eat a meal.  For every five minutes I study, I get to watch six consecutive holiday-themed episodes of South Park on Comedy Central. For every hour I study, I get to spend a day hanging out with friends.  For every full day I study, I get to uh not fail my classes.  Ive been generally unimpressed with some of the study aids Ive referred to, to try and get a sense of some frameworks for organizing my notes.  Civil Procedure for Dummies isnt really helping me much.  Chapter 1: Courthouses are Big was especially unhelpful.  The HL Central Outline Bank has been somewhat useful, although the law of diminishing returns (Is that really a law?  Its not in my notes) seems to kick in pretty quickly.  After reading, say, fifteen contracts outlines, theres probably nothing in number sixteen that one hasnt seen already.  There are only so many different ways to say value promised minus value received.  I was in a bookstore a few days ago.  And discovered that, unfortunately, What to Expect When Youre Expecting is not about expectancy.  Also, The Intent to Be Bound was not about consideration.  I found that right near a treatise on covenants not to compete for legal recruiters, called Servicing Your Clients.  And in the video and DVD section of the bookstore, I noticed an exercise tape without a warranty of fitness.  Sitting in front of my computer for too long makes me think thats actually funny.  Almost as funny as chapter five of Civil Procedure for Dummies, called One Law, Two Law, Red Law, Blue Law, all about the Erie doctrine and choice of law provisions.  Or chapter three of The Idiots Guide to Criminal Law, Oops!  I Didnt Think It Was Loaded!    Not to be confused with the chapter about the Goetz subway shooting case, Oops! I Didnt Mean to Merely Injure!

      An excerpt from the popular study guide, Civil Procedure for Dummies.  Chapter 1: Courthouses are Big  Look outside the window.  Turn around.  Not too fast or youll get dizzy.  Chances are, you will see at least one building bigger than all the rest.  It might be a courthouse.  Because courthouses are big.  Chapter 2: Going to Court  Its usually best to go to court in a car, unless the reason youre in court is because your drivers license was suspended.  Or if you dont have a car, its probably not a good idea to steal one and drive it to court.  If you live really close to the court, you might be able to walk there.  Look both ways before you cross the street.  Chapter 3: Finding stuff  Lawyers use a technique called discovery to find evidence that you did bad stuff.  They can ask you questions or make you give them papers that have big words on them.  Dont try and read the papers.  Theyre for the smarter lawyers.  The ones who didnt buy Civil Procedure for Dummies.  Chapter 4: Personal Jurisdiction  You can skip this subject.  You wont understand it anyway.  Chapter 5: One Law, Two Law, Red Law, Blue Law  Different states have different laws.  Luckily, you dont have to know any of them.  Just know theyre different.  And they each have rules about when you use their laws, and when you use the laws of other states.  There are 50 states.  Thats why there are 50 stars on the American flag.  The flag is pretty.  And big.  Like a courthouse.  Theres probably a flag in the courthouse.  Chapter 6: Res Judicata  An anagram of res judicata is Jar Caused It.  Thats also a good defense if youre ever accused of throwing jars at people.

      Merry Christmas!  Here in New York, the snow's coming down pretty hard.  Yet, even on Christmas, in the middle of a snowstorm, we were still able to get chinese food delivered.  What a world we live in!  In honor of the snow... it's yet another pair of song parodies... I promise more variation once I'm back at school and things are actually happening that can inspire me to have something to write about...  One about the law... "Just a 'B'" (to the tune of "Let It Snow")  Oh the thought of a "C" is frightful And an "A" would be delightful But I'll be okay to see Just a B, Just a B, Just a B.  The law isn't learned by osmosis The wave of a wand, "hocus-pocus" In the classroom I've got only me Just a B, Just a B, Just a B  When the test paper's there in my hand And I realize I don't know the law I suppose then I will understand That studying's what winter break's for!  Right now there are students reading And they'll be the ones succeeding As I write this song par-o-dy Just a B, Just a B, Just a B  And one not about the law... "Fill the Malls" (to the tune of "Deck the Halls")  Fill the malls with Christmas shoppers Fa la la la la, La la la la Eating donuts, eating Whoppers Fa la la la la, La la la la Spending money, all on credit Fa la la, La la la, La la la Self-control? Aw just forget it! Fa la la la la, La la la la  See the people fight for Barbies Fa la la la la, La la la la Eating fattening food from Arby's Fa la la la la, La la la la One of each, let's keep on churning Fa la la, La la la, La la la Back tomorrow for returning Fa la la la la, La la la la  Now we've got that Christmas feeling Fa la la la la, La la la la Boxes stacked up to the ceiling Fa la la la la, La la la la Low low prices! Down they're marking! Fa la la, La la la, La la la Twenty dollars just for parking Fa la la la la, La la la la!

      More wordplay.  I'm in the middle of studying civil procedure, so I thought I'd try a rhyming couplet for each of a bunch of Federal Rules.  These are mostly pretty dumb I guess.  Sorry.  Rule 8: Plead your facts plain and short Or your case will be thrown out of court  9(b): If it's fraud, be complete 'Cause it's not nice to call one a cheat  11: Make sure paper's signed Or you may well get yourself fined  12(b)(6): There isn't a claim Your facts have no law to their name  12(e): If the pleading is vague Like "that thing he sold gave me the Plague"  12(h): You might lose a defense Malpractice suit's quite an expense  (13) Is asserting my counterclaim good? If it's all one transaction you should  (14) If another guy's really the cheater Then bring him in with an impleader  (15) My pleading's wrong! Can I amend? If the trial judge is your best friend  (23) Tiny lawsuits don't bring satisfaction But together they make a class action   (24) "Let me in!" she screamed, causing a scene 'Til the judge let the girl intervene  (26) Divorce case, so gifts from her lover Are perfectly fair to discover  (28) Just subpoenas: I don't need permission To take anyone's deposition  (32) If you've died since I had you deposed Then I may present all you disclosed  (35) Are you insane enough to commit? An exam: the court has to permit  (55) You may not have committed assault But by staying home from court, you're in default  You may think that these couplets all suck But in my head, all these rules are now stuck

      Some Holiday-inspired law limericks.  For whatever they're worth.  The girl worked on Christmas and New Years Hadn't gotten a day off in *two* years She begged her employer But he is a lawyer So she's stuck with one more of her *blue* years.  There once was a man who was short Who was sued for committing a tort He thought state court unpleasant Gave the plaintiff a present And removed it to federal court  The judge said there's issue preclusion Leaving John in a state of confusion Though he'd studied at Yale Always passed when pass/fail Seems the J.D. is just an illusion  Santa came with the presents you got But as he walked towards the tree he was shot In this state, the law said You can fill them with lead When they enter your house, on the spot.

      39-page outline for criminal law, 42 pages for criminal procedure.  Next up: civil procedure.  I'm finding there's a way to do these things --   Step 1: find a good study guide and read it to make sure there aren't any big gaps in your knowledge Step 2: find a good commercial outline and steal their structure and main category headings, along with the black-letter rules, deleting the parts you didn't cover and aren't responsible for Step 3: go through your class notes and beef up the commercial outline where appropriate with policy, clarifications, etc Step 4: find some old outlines, comb through for some extra stuff you don't have, or sections they've done better than you've got, and add it in Step 5: read through and cut any redundancies out  And, voila, I've got a workable and complete outline.  Or at least I hope I do...  anyone have a better way to do it or see something I'm missing??

      Today I've been trying to make my way through Glannon's Civil Procedure: Examples and Explanations study guide, just to make sure there aren't any big holes in my understanding of civil procedure and to make sure I understand all of the concepts.  My favorite part -- at the end of each chapter there's 10 pages of questions and answers.  I'm sure they're useful, but for my purposes right now I'm skipping over them, and I'll probably go back to them closer to the exam, to make sure I can answer them quickly and accurately -- so it makes the page numbers go up nice and quickly.  4-page chapters with 10 pages of q&a are especially rewarding.

      A Look Into The Future  Since Ive been home, Ive been watching too much television.  Too much news.  Too much about the public shaming of Trent Lott and the almost-imperceptible daily movement towards the war with Iraq  United States issues international proclamation of badness on Monday, President Bush dreams of day when war with Iraq was not imminent on Wednesday, and New study shows war with Iraq is moving closer but potentially holds the key to curing leprosy, on Friday.    I realized the other day that while they keep talking about war  war is coming, war is bad, war is expensive  they never consider the chance that we might lose.  I know very little about the actual reality of foreign affairs, and I'm really just using this premise to make the funny part of what I'm writing make sense and have some context -- so I apologize if this is unintentionally offensive to say; I'm really just going for the joke here -- but it just doesn't seem to be within the realm of newsworthy possibility that Iraq would ever beat us and I suppose then take over the United States.  Sounds silly even to say, I guess.  Kind of funny.  But imagine the news stories then.  Dateline: January 2004 Cambridge, MA  Harvard Law School Renames Library  Today, Harvard Law School announced that Langdell Hall, the largest academic law library in the world  and second only to the Library of Congress overall  would be renamed effective immediately due to the United States' defeat in the war against Iraq.  Saddam Hussein Library will reopen this afternoon. Without any books.   In addition, the Harkness Commons student center is set to be renamed the Hussein Center tomorrow morning at a ceremony in which the bar will be converted into a holding cell for infidels, the television will no longer receive HBO, and the Harkbox Caf will discontinue offering the Caffe Americano variety of Starbucks coffee.    When classes resume next week, students will find that a number of courses have new titles.  Evidence, Property, and Criminal Law will now be called, respectively, Fabricating Evidence, Government Property, and Death! Death! Death! Feminist Legal Theory has been cancelled and the professor has been hanged.  First Amendment Law is expected to be cancelled, but the new law prohibiting the mention of the first amendment has made it impossible for a statement to be released.  Robert Clark, former dean of the law school, issued a statement today reading in part, Boy am I glad I retired when I did! But new dean Saddam Hussein, Jr. has big plans for the law school.  Last week, he proclaimed to much fanfare, I promise to make Harvard Law School #1 in the Iraqi News and World Report rankings.  Down with Stanford.  New dean of student life Saddam Hussein III, in a nod towards reform, promises to execute no more than 40% of the student body.  And the Office of Financial Aid recently announced that the LIPP program will now forgive loans for students in military service, but will force those students who do any sort of good for society to pay double.  All female law students, obviously, have been transferred to Lesley College, where they will learn how to sweep up rubble.  (Lesley College officials refused to comment regarding the necessary expansion of their sweep up rubble program, which had previously been relatively unpopular as compared with the needlepoint and quilting departments.)    It was expected that given this set of changes, applications would drop, but since Harvard Business School has been converted into the worlds most luxurious missile-building factory, with diamond-studded 14-karat gold warheads being produced at a record pace, applications to the law school have in fact risen. This is a trend that has not affected at least one of Harvards competitors.  A spokesperson for Yale Law School said in a press conference this morning, we haven't really been affected by losing the war. After all, some may say that Iraq is actually an improvement over New Haven.  Nevertheless, even as much of the law school changes, one thing will stay the same.  The First-Year Lawyering program (FYL) has been praised by the Iraqis as fostering exactly the kinds of skills and talents they hope to instill in their future leaders.  Thus the program will go unchanged, and will in fact be expanded to meet daily in Hussein East.  I mean Hussein North.  Or is it Hussein West?  Students are instructed to gather by the big statue of Saddam Hussein made out of leftover squash and the correct classroom assignments will be posted.

      Finished up the song from yesterday.  Check it out.  Today's creative endeavor... an open letter to summer job employers from a generic first-year law student.  We'll call this generic first-year law student "Not-Me."  I'll also stick a disclaimer here that this is designed to be funny, like this whole entire weblog is.  It's all designed to be humorous, not serious.  It's a creative outlet, that's all.  Like the song from yesterday about the model penal code -- I don't hate the model penal code, I'm just trying to be funny.  In fact, I have no overall opinion about the model penal code whatsoever, other than I've always thought the word "penal" is a funny word.  And writing a song about the model penal code doesn't make me a bad person who likes to make fun of our legal regime, or if it does, that's not my intention.  Disclaimers aside, here we go... an open letter to summer employers... apologies that this is in fact more serious than most of the weblog entries.  The funny will return after this brief message...  Dear Potential Summer Employer,  There are lots of us, and we look awfully indistinguishable from each other.  We've been at law school for just three months, and already we have to look for a summer job.  We've all taken the same classes, learned the same things, and haven't even gotten any grades.  We haven't seen enough law to even know everything that's out there, and the different things that lawyers do.  We've only had a short opportunity to be inspired, fascinated, challenged, excited, and perplexed by the law.  There are future corporate lawyers, district attorneys, policymakers, U.S. Senators, law professors, judges, advocates, arbitrators, radio talk-show hosts, and commissioners of professional sports leagues among us who simply don't know it yet.  We haven't been exposed to enough law to figure it all out.  So three months in, as we search for a summer job, we can't be totally sure, and we shouldn't be expected to be.  The mass of us applying to corporate law firms -- most aren't doing it because of a burning desire to practice corporate law, although most aren't doing it because of a burning desire not to.  The mass of us applying to public interest organizations -- many of us have issues we care about, policy ideas we're passionate about -- but many of us are just trying to figure out where our hearts lie.  We're trying to figure it out, and hoping this summer lets us find out a little more about where we do want to be, where we want to end up, what we want to do.  There's a difference between sending out four hundred resumes indiscriminately to anything and everything in the three cities we've decided are tolerable to work in as opposed to making a good-faith effort to identify what we want to do this summer, where we can contribute value, and what might help us decide what the future should hold -- even if in both cases the result is a cover letter and resume that look pretty similar.  None of us are beyond the point where we have to make choices without full information -- we've experienced only a small piece of our law school experience.  So a corporate law firm looking at a resume that screams out "passionate about the environment" can't necessarily assume the person doesn't want to work there, just like a public interest firm looking at a resume that screams out "investment banker" ought not assume the resume necessarily reveals the contents of a person's heart.  We're trying to figure out what we want to do, where we want to go, who we want to be.  It's a good-faith effort.  Thanks."

      It's hard to study at home.  Much easier to surf the web, watch TV, and sleep.  Yet I must persist.  Or write another law-school-parodying song.  If the world went by the model penal code... And if you were one day walking 'cross the road... And a car came by and flattened you Yes he roadkill-in-Manhattaned you Then a prison sentence surely he'd be owed If the world went by the model penal code...  If it turned out he was merely negligent... And to hit you wasn't something that he meant... If he simply hadn't hit the brake It was just an innocent mistake Then while it would surely be a felony Negligent homicide is just a third degree  But if he was in fact a reckless reckless man Driving even though the law didn't say he can If he's blind and deaf and has no arms And he caused you homicidal harms And he thought he had a license; he did not Then it's probably manslaughter what he's got  If he did purposely and knowingly commit A gun that he done shot or wrist he slit Then it's murder, murder first degree He values life indifferently And the inside of the jail will be his life If he thought and deliberated -- then killed his wife  If the world went by the model penal code... If the world went by the model penal code... If the rules were set consistently 'Bout the different kinds of felony Then at least what you were doing could be knowed If the world went by the model penal code...

      A song about the Parol Evidence Rule.  (For the non-law students in the audience: the Parol Evidence Rule is simply a rule that says if you have a contract in writing, you're not allowed to claim there's stuff you talked about that wasn't included in the contract that should be enforced.  For example, you buy a car, the contract says nothing about a CD player, and you claim the seller said he'd install a new CD player.  You're out of luck.  And one more thing -- Parol is pronounced with a long o, like parole, or hole, or goal, or birth control.)  We met on a park bench in the summer A day that surely changed my life Because just seven hours later I asked you if you'd be my wife  You said you needed time to think it over And forty-five seconds passed like years You said you'd love to have a wedding And we could register at Sears   That's when I knew that we different From two separate income brackets You buy generic acetaminophen I have 3 ten thousand dollar tennis rackets So I asked you to sign A pre-nuptial agreement to say That when I divorce you You'll be back at the Sizzler buffet   I told you that I'd always support you But wrote down you don't get a cent Told you you'd never have to worry "You'll be poor" is what I meant  And since I am a contracts lawyer And you dropped out of school at eight You did not really read the contract And make me set the record straight   So nine months later it's our trial I found someone slightly thinner You want back the shirt you bought me I want you to starve for dinner And that's what you signed The contract says you have zero claim What I said doesn't count From a rule that has a name  It rhymes with birth control Which we didn't use, so you'll have a kid, and you'll both be on the dole But I don't care Saved by parol The parol evidence rule Keeping rich people rich That's what they teach us in law school  (Note: I haven't actually studied yet... so my understanding of the Parol Evidence Rule may be totally screwy.  Oh well.)

      Time to Study  As I write this, I have approximately 589 hours until my first exam.  And Ive read approximately 3000 pages in all of my classes combined.  So if read about 15 pages an hour, I can read everything again twice, spend 50 hours per class on outlining and doing practice exams, spend 30 hours memorizing the Uniform Commercial Code, 6 hours reading Glannons for Civil Procedure, and still have time to see a movie.  But not Harry Potter  its too long.  Maybe Adam Sandlers cartoon.  Its only 71 minutes.  If I time it right, I can even see half the previews too.  But Im forgetting something.  A couple of things, actually.  Like sleeping.  And eating.  And brushing my teeth.  Although if I dont waste time eating, I suppose I dont really have to brush my teeth.  Or go to the bathroom.  This can turn out to be quite a plan.  Although to stay awake for 24 straight days, I probably need to drink some coffee, and then of course Ill have to go to the bathroom.  So I dont know.  I may be stuck.  One more thing Im forgetting.  That Im not insane.  I was going to bring all my books home with me, but then I remembered I dont have a pack mule to carry them, so thats not going to happen.  Its come down to my contracts casebook or underwear  Im still deciding which ones more important.  I actually spent time last night contemplating tearing apart the binding of my criminal procedure book and ripping out the 300 pages we read, just so I dont have to take the whole book home with me.  But, once again, I remembered that Im not insane, so I stopped.  Im falling into the trap of overscheduling my time at home.  On Tuesday, Im meeting two friends for lunch, another friend for coffee, three friends for dinner, two more friends to see a movie, and one friend to carry my casebooks around for me all day so I can study in between.  Actually two friends.  Like I said, the books are too heavy.  Really, its just a waste of energy (not to mention a valuable twenty minutes I could otherwise spend memorizing one more federal rule of civil procedure) to even think about studying when I know that while Ill be a good boy when I get home  take my books out of my bag, stack them neatly on my desk, take out some highlighters, boot up my laptop  after about twenty minutes, the next time I see the word assumpsit will be when I pack the books to come back here two weeks later.  If I really get any studying done it either means I dont have enough friends, or that law school has actually succeeded in turning me insane.  We should all make a pact.  No studying over break.  Leave the books here.  Take the batteries out of the laptops.  Shut down the HL Central outline bank.  After all, were graded on a curve.  So if nobody studies, were no worse off individually than if everyone studies.  And we can actually enjoy ourselves.  I know the argument against this plan is that theres a pretty big incentive to cheat  to be the only one who studies while everyone else is out ice skating in Central Park, relaxing on the beach in the Cayman Islands (the first tropical location that came to mind  the commercials work!), or interviewing at law firms in Washington, DC (fun!).    But theres an honor code, isnt there?  And if there isnt, there should be.  A law student honor code.  No raising your hand in class when other people are speaking, no working on assignments more than 24 hours before theyre due, no background reading not assigned by the professor, no comments about how class isnt really supposed to end for another ten minutes, no commercial outlines, no showing up on Friday, and no tasty-looking food unless you have enough to share with everyone.  I hate showing up to class hungry and seeing everyone eating muffins and donuts and cookies and roast beef and pasta and tandoori chicken and king crab legs while I have a little bit of toothpaste in the back of my mouth I can swallow and an orange lifesaver thats been stuck in my jacket pocket for eight months.  So we just have to add no studying over break to the honor code.  Easy as pie.  Pumpkin pie, lemon meringue pie, pecan pie, cherry pie while all I have in my refrigerator is half a container of milk thats rapidly turning into cheese, and half a block of cheese thats rapidly turning into a prescription-strength antibiotic.  I probably shouldnt write when Im hungry.  It all ends up about food after a while.

      At the end of Civil Procedure today, the class presented the professor with a monogrammed bathrobe and a set of shower accessories -- he had said at the end of class one day that class had been so stimulating that he needed to go home and take a shower.  This is a 70-year-old man, by the way.  So his response to the gift was "this is something my wife and I will enjoy.  Perhaps together."  In that spirit, I present a very disturbing Top 5 list of other things he meant to say.  (I apologize that without some Civil Procedure knowledge, this isn't that funny).  5. "For all the places my Long Arm can't reach!" 4. "This soap smells just like my arthritis cream." 3. "I can use it to wash my Hanson and my Denckla." 2. "This will allow my wife and I to engage in some new forms of Discovery." 1. "This soap will help me clean my most personal jurisdiction of them all!"

      Saw someone on his way downstairs to do laundry.  He was wearing a bright purple-and-green striped shirt and a pair of red sweatpants.  That's when you know it's really time to do laundry.  The West Wing tonight featured the Yale Whiffenpoofs a cappella group.  Way cool.  I wish I was a Whiffenpoof.  Althoug I'm happy being a Scale of Justice (our a cappella group) I suppose.  We had the last contracts class this morning.  Professor ended with a great speech about how grades are imperfect measures of our minds, and they don't even really count for anything anyway.  I'm paraphrasing: "You got good grades to get here.  Well done.  You won.  The game is over.  You're here, and you'll do fine in the world, whether you get A's or B's.  Unfortunately, half of you will be in the bottom 50% of the class.  The real shame would be if you let that stop you from caring, stop you from engaging, stop you from playing the game.  Don't turn down the dial just because you get a B.  You already won.  Enjoy it here and get the most out of what there is to offer.  Because you'll never be in a place like this again."  She's so awesome.  It's ridiculous.  I wrote in my course evaluation that I would take a class on the phone book if Prof. Warren was teaching it.  She's why there are teachers.

      Colin Quinn (formerly of Saturday Night Live) has a new TV show on Comedy Central, following the Daily Show.  I saw the premiere last night.  It's basically a low-rent version of Politically Incorrect.  4 comedians and Colin Quinn talking about random stuff in the news.  Not very good.  I predict it lasts two weeks.  Maybe less.

      There's another weblog out there that's been categorizing law students into a number of different classroom types.  I thought I'd give it a try, as semester one finishes up...  THE WORLD-REVOLVER For the World-Revolver, every class is a class of one, and anyone else in the room is invisible.  If the World-Revolver puts down his hand, it's only so that he can leave class to get some food, or so that he can simply interrupt the discussion without even bothering to wait to be called on.  Why is it even necessarily for the professor to acknowledge his or her hand when there's no else of any use in the room anyway.  It's a one-on-one tutorial for the World-Revolver, so questions of no interest to the rest of the class are fair game.  And, of course, the class doesn't really need to end when it's over, so the World-Revolvers are sure to run up to the professor's desk to continue the tutorial when class has finished.  A typical in-class comment from a World-Revolver: "I was absent yesterday -- would you mind repeating everything you said?  And after that, I have this hypothetical I'd like to pose regarding my grandmother's infected boil and article 2-305 of the Uniform Commercial Code."  THE APPROVAL-SEEKER The Approval-Seeker treats class as an opportunity to demonstrate to the professor that he or she wants to be the President of the professor's fan club.  A student of this type constantly nods his or head in agreement when the professor makes a point, laughs heartily at the professor's jokes, and offers comments in class that consistently reflect the student having done additional reading on his own, especially of anything written by the professor.  These students compete with the World-Revolvers for the prime positions up at the professor's desk after class to ask questions.  But the Approval-Seekers aren't usually there to ask actual questions.  They just want to bask in the professor's glow -- and make sure the professor remembers they were there.  A typical in-class comment from an approval seeker: "Wonderful point, professor.  I was reading your article in the May 1974 Journal of Administrative Law and noticed you also said that government regulation can stifle innovation.  Is that point still valid, or have there been substantial changes since?  I was thinking of doing an independent study project on the issue and was hoping you might be willing to be my advisor.  But we can talk about that after class."  THE MY-TURN The My-Turn simply won't shut up.  It's not so much that he ignores the rest of the class or cares about impressing the professor.  It's just that he or she always has something to say.  Anyone else's comment is simply an opportunity for the My-Turn to share his or her thoughts on the matter.  Someone else is talking?  The My-Turn's hand is in the air, waiting impatiently for the first moment he can jump in.  Professor poses a question?  He's got an answer.  Right or wrong, it doesn't matter.  Said it before?  Who cares?  The My-Turn can never hear himself talk enough.  A typical in-class comment from a My-Turn: "Following up on Ms. Smith's point, I want to once again reiterate that I think crime is bad.  No matter what kind of crime, we need to try and stop it.  I disagree with whoever said some kinds of crime are good.  I think crime is bad.  And if you disagree, I will only continue to press my point.  Crime is bad.  Unquestionably."  THE FILLING-MY-QUOTA The Filling-My-Quota has decided that he or she must speak once per class, come hell or high water.  Prone to not paying any attention at all to what's actually going on -- usually having not done the reading and addicted to solitaire to boot, a class simply can't pass without the Filling-My-Quota offering some instantly forgettable comment of some sort.  It's not so much that this type of student is irritating -- he doesn't talk enough for that to happen -- but that you know it's coming, and you know it'll be siply a useless statement.  Typical comment from a filling-my-quota: "I agree with the last point.  String beans are usually green."  THE CRAZY-OUTLIER The Crazy-Outlier says strange things consistently.  He or she simply has extreme positions on anything that comes up in a class discussion, and makes it a point to share those positions.  Usually entertaining, often a relief in comparison to hearing the usual chors of agreement, the Crazy-Outlier just needs to be careful of speaking too much and becoming a My-Turn.  In small doses, the Crazy-Outlier can sometimes make a class truly interesting.  Typical comment from a crazy-outlier: "Abortion should not only be allowed, it should be mandatory."  THE EYE-ROLLER The Eye-Roller hates his classmates, hates life, and, most of all, hates what you've just said. Sometimes it's just a facial expression, sometimes a sigh from the back of the room, sometimes a comment: "yeah, right," "I don't think so," and "sure..." being some of the favorites.  Whenever he or she raises his hand, it's to cast doubt on what's been said before, or simply to express disgust for the entire discussion.  Typical comment from the eye-roller: "That's a ridiculous point-of-view.  We can't go around arresting criminals.  It's nonsense.  I don't even know why it's on the table and how Mr. Brown looks at himself in the mirror every morning after making a comment like that."  THE LOST-IN-SPACE The Lost-In-Space may as well not be in class.  He or she may have done the reading, but probably hasn't.  The real problem is that the lost-in-space is just never paying attention.  It's a shock to the system when he's called on, and can never really get it together enough to make any point at all.  Also prone to asking questions about irrelevant subjects.  Typical comment from a lost-in-space: "Can you repeat the question?  I just, uh, I wasn't really following... I'm a little confused... could you explain how contracts and steamed broccoli are related?"  THE FIREFLY The Firefly spends most of the time completely silent.  But every so often he lights up with something extraordinary to say.  It's never expected, and it's always completely on the ball.  And it's rare enough that there's no irritating factor at all.  This is the kind of student most aspire to be.  Typical comment: "It seems to me that even though the two laws conflict on the face of things, the first applies only to nights and weekends, and the second applies to normal business hours.  So, using the precedent set in the previous case, we can reconcile the differences without the legal theory collapsing onto itself."  THE WALLFLOWER The Wallflower never dances unless he or she is forced to.  Sometimes they can dance, sometimes they can't, but they'll never volunteer to.  And once they're on the dance floor, they're looking for the quickest way off.  Typical comment: "Me?  Uh, the court said no."

      Had the last criminal law class this morning.  Had to fill out course evaluations.  The bubble sheets, that require a #2 pencil.  Which, of course, three people had.  So we all had to share.  Maybe it's a secret plan to keep us from filling out the forms.  In undergrad they always had little boxes of golf pencils for us to use.  I guess Harvard's endowment isn't big enough to afford those.  We're doing a Secret Snowflake (think Secret Santa, but non-denominational) thing in my section and I still have to go get my person a present.  I spent a few minutes trying to think of something creative.  But nothing came to me.  I think I'll go with a Jelly Belly bear with jelly beans or something like that.  The cold weather makes going out and actually getting it somewhat of a chore.  Maybe that can be an activity for later this afternoon.  The only schoolwork I have left before break is to revise my first-year-lawyering memo and hand in the final draft.  I keep opening the Word file and just not doing anything.  I'm paralyzed to do work.  I took a nap last night from 6:30-8:40, prime working hours... I don't know what it is that's stopping me from just sitting down and getting done with it.  Sorry for the rambling without a point.  I'll try to make up for it with something funny here.  Top Ten Things A Professor Shouldn't Say At the End of the Last Class of the Semester  10. "You guys should know, you're the fourteenth best class I ever taught."  9. "One last thing.  Everything I said this semester was a lie.  Have a great vacation." 8. "And that concludes the introductory remarks.  Next semester we'll start with the real stuff." 7. "I hope you've learned a lot this semester.  Because the exam's gonna be a killer." 6. "I faked this whole teaching thing pretty well, didn't I?" 5. "The half of the book we didn't cover?  You'll be responsible for knowing that as well." 4. "I suppose it's okay to tell you now.  I'm not really the professor.  I killed the professor in September and have been pretending to be him all semester so nobody would notice." 3. "Wow.  All semester I've had a highly contagious infection, and, shockingly enough, no one in whole class has caught it!  Congratulations!" 2. "Finally!  I can't wait to get away from all of you!" 1. "We still have a lot more material to cover.  The doors are locked from the outside.  We're staying here until I'm done."

      From my civil procedue professor: "...each paper is marked with a letter, either "E" (for excellent), "G" (for good), or "F" (for fair).  A brief effort to explain these letters is made in the cover memo, but I mention the letters here so that no one will mistake any of them as standing for something else."  If the lowest grade is F, can it really stand for Fair?  Can everyone's paper really be no worse than Fair?

      Here's a column about yesterday's job fair.  More observations that didn't make the column are below, in the next post.  Those are the exclusive "weblog job fair outtakes," available only in the weblog (or in every conversation I'll have for the next three days, until I've gotten maximum mileage out of every funny thing I can possibly think of about the fair).  A Trip to the Job Fair  I showed up too late to the job fair this past Friday.  All of the stress balls were gone.  Theyre my all-time favorite job fair giveaway.  Overall, I was pretty underwhelmed with the things the law firms had for us.  I ended up with a yo-yo, a couple of highlighters (including a really cool  but fundamentally impossible to hold in one hand and actually write with  three-sided futuristic highlighter-slash-boomerang), more pens than Ill ever use, a garbage pail full of fake-velvet pen cases (the point of which are completely and utterly unclear to me  are they saying their pens are so valuable, you need to protect them in a tiny bag or risk them getting  what  dusty?), and a tremendous block of post-it notes from the law firm of Sticky & Stickier.  LLP.  Whatever that stands for.  Lonely Law-firm Partners.  Lawyers Loot People.  Less Life Probable.  Long Long Projects.  Let us Leave, Please.    The yo-yo I got came in an impenetrable container.  I felt awfully silly standing in front of the recruiter trying to wedge open the box.  Im not smart enough to open a metal container, but Id like a job at your firm.  I would have felt stupider if Id actually handed her a resume.  I only gave out one resume.  Printed on plain white paper, rolled up in a ball in my pocket.  Only because the woman asked for one when I reached for the velvet pen case.  Which office do you want to work for? she asked.  New York, I said, confidently.  Oh.  We dont have a New York office.  I meant Washington, DC.  We dont have a Washington office.  Boston?  Nope.  She pointed to some pile of glossy literature I hadnt noticed, in between the mints and the chocolate bars.  Our offices are listed in here.  Atlanta, Milwaukee, and San Francisco.  I guess Ill go with Milwaukee, I said, hoping I wouldnt be asked why.  Why? she asked.  I hear its nice there, I lied.  Okay, she said, pitying me and my chances of finding a job.  Amazingly enough, she actually wrote Milwaukee on the top of my resume and put it in a pile.  That pile just happened to be in the trash can.  As I walked away, I saw her take the moron rubber stamp from her pocket, and stamp my resume three times.  One for each city I didnt know they didnt have offices in.  Undergraduate job fairs were more fun than this one.  I went to a technology job fair once, and walked away with seven t-shirts, four stress balls, a koosh yo-yo, three cookies, a Nerf football, four daily planners, and, unfortunately, an interview.  Which, oddly enough, ended up being the job I took coming out of college.  I traded my resume for a t-shirt at a career fair, and it just sort of snowballed from there, became the line Id use when people asked me why I chose to come work there.  No one else seemed to find it amusing.  On my way out of the job fair, I passed by the ACLU table.  They were giving away some kind of small metallic container with a pull-tab.  It looked very much like those small cream cheese packets they have at the Hark, or you get on airplanes or in the kinds of restaurants where waffles are available twenty-four hours a day.  Cream cheese or jelly, perhaps.  I was sure it was one of the two.  I was assuming they had run out of bagels, and were just left with the spreads.  Im glad I didnt ask them about the bagels.  Because it wasnt cream cheese.  And Im not sure that a bagel and a condom makes for a very satisfying afternoon snack.  Seriously, why would the ACLU decide to give out condoms at a career fair?  What career were they pushing?  Does taking a bunch of free condoms make you a more attractive potential employee?  Hey, you taking all the condoms  looks like youd be perfect around the office.  With our Christmas party coming up and everything can I see your resume?

      Yesterday I went to a job fair the office of career services was holding -- 30 law firms and the ACLU were there, some trying to actually solicit first-years to give them resumes for a summer position, and some just trying to make their names known so we like them better next year, when they're actually looking to hire us for the summer.    Like simply seeing them at a job fair a year ago is going to make me more likely to take a summer position at Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw.  I remember their name only because they gave out a pen.  Anyway, I got there pretty late, but I was still able to collect a bunch of free toys.   One firm was giving out Bon Jovi CDs.  I'm confused as to why.  Perhaps the remnants of a promotion from, oh, I don't know, 15 years ago, were discovered in a warehouse?    I missed the stress balls -- they were all gone by the time I got there.  Does it say something when a law firm gives out stress balls?  Are they admitting their job causes stress?  Or just that they got a good deal from the local stress-ball supplier.

      I had dinner last night with my Criminal Law professor.  He's been sending out e-mails inviting groups of 6 students out to eat with him.  It's pretty cool to eat with professors and get to talk to them outside of the classroom.  He talked a bunch about his year spent clerking for Justice Marshall on the Supreme Court and how he got to go to a barbecue at the Justice's house, where the Justice himself was flipping burgers on the grill.  He said the clerkship was really hard work and long hours.  But still, if you're gonna work long hours, are there that many jobs cooler than clerking for the Supreme Court?

      From page 307 of my Civil Procedure casebook:  "The same year, a decision of the Sixth Circuit expressed concern about mass tort product liability class actions, particularly when they embraced a nationwide class.  Anerican Medical Systems, Inc. sought class certification of a nationwide class of people  who suffered damages from implants of allegedly defective penile prostheses  manufactured by defendant. *** It noted that class members had used  at least ten different models  of the prosthesis and that legal claims would 'differ depending upon the model and the year it was issued.'  It also found that there would be individualized evidence as to such issues as 'surgical error, improper use of the device,  anatomical incompatibility , infection, device malfunction, or  psychological problems .'"  And you thought law school reading was dry and boring!

      Just in case you thought life at law school was interesting:  "Perspectives on Democracy, Stability, and Development in Ecuador" Round-table Discussion with former President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador Thursday, 5 December 2002, 7:00PM  I'm being a little too glib here.  I'm sure there are some people who'd find this interesting.  Also, just in case there are any other Harvard Law students reading this... have I been discovered yet?... I figure I should plug the a cappella concert I'm in this Thursday:  "Worst Case Scenario" - Scales of Justice Winter Concert Thursday, 5 December 2002, 8:00PM Ropes Gray Room, Pound Hall  Come hear the Scales of Justice, the law school's premier a cappella ensemble, on Thursday, December 5 at 8pm in Ropes-Gray for its Fall 2002 concert, "Worst Case Scenario"!  Featuring favorites by U2, Dave Matthews Band, Shawn Colvin, Jackson Five, originals, and more.  Tickets are only $5 and are available Wednesday 4 December and Thursday 5 December in Harkness Commons and at the door.  And if you need any more incentive to take a break from the grind... there's free beer!  The "originals" they mention refers to a song I wrote and arranged called "Don't Call On Me."  You'll find the lyrics if you search my archives.  The "Worst Case Scenario" refers to the theme of the skits inbetween the songs, which I helped write.  "the law school's premier a cappella ensemble" is overreaching a bit.  "the... only" would be more like it.

      I was just watching 60 Minutes (yes, I'm really 75 years old...) and literally cringed at something Andy Rooney said during his commentary at the end.  He was talking about newspapers -- and I'm not really sure what his point was -- he had about a dozen newspapers spread across his desk and he had a couple of comments about each one.  "Here in the Asbury Park Press was an article about a woman who dressed up her twin daughters in costume and sent them to rob a bank... I wonder what her husband does for a living."  And one of the last ones he had was a college newspaper from the University of Virginia -- the headline and byline were called out on the screen -- "Taking a Stand for Good Writing" by Jeffrey Eisenberg.  And I thought to myself, "wow, what a lucky kid, his college newspaper article's on national television.    And Andy Rooney said: "And here in the Daily Cavalier, a newspaper at the University of Virginia, a student wrote an article all about good writing.  And it's written  badly ."    And I literally cringed.  Regardless of whether the article's good or not -- I found it on the web  urlLink here  but I haven't read it yet, so I have no idea if it's good or not -- what right does Andy Rooney have to embarass a  college student  on TV like that?  He's not a professional journalist, and even if the article sucks, so does most of what's in any college paper.  I really, genuinely feel bad for the writer.  I mean, millions of people watch 60 Minutes.  It just doesn't feel right to me.  Maybe it just hits close to home because of my law school newspaper column -- I certainly wouldn't want Andy Rooney telling the world I write badly, whether or not it's true.  I have to wonder if I'm overreacting, or if this is really going to turn into a story.  I'll check the UVA newspaper tomorrow and the next day to see if there's any mention...   Edited to add : The article's from January 2002.  The rest of the articles Rooney talked about were about recent events -- the oil tanker spill near Spain, John Kerry's exploratory committee for President -- so why would he pick this UVA article from 11 months ago?  The last article this guy wrote, incidentally -- but I imagine that's just a coincidence.  I'm baffled.  At the very least, the fact that the article's so old means that Andy Rooney's careless to include it.  But I wonder if there's more than that?  I'm a little baffled.  And, yes, I know this isn't worth the time I've spent thinking about it...

      Back in Boston.  Cold.  I saw "Bowling for Columbine" last night.  I liked it, thought it was very entertaining and parts of it were thought-provoking.  But what confused me a bit was the point Michael Moore was trying to make.    (Warning: Non-specific spoilers ahead)    The overall message was "there's too much gun violence in America," which makes sense enough, and the data holds that it's the case that more people in America are killed by guns than anywhere else (although the documentary conveniently uses raw numbers instead of adjusting for population when comparing the US to other countries -- needlessly, really, because the numbers are much higher here regardless so why even try and mislead).  But his explanations as to why seemed contradictory.    He argued (1) It's not just because we have more guns, because other countries have lots of guns, like Canada, and nowhere near as much gun violence.  Then he argued (2) It's not because of lax gun control laws and too many bullets for sale -- because, again, Canada has similar laws and easy availability of bullets (although he spends a chunk of the film focusing on the fact that Wal-Mart and K-Mart sell bullets, and isn't that a shame -- which it is, I agree, but he contends it's not the reason for gun violence -- so why spend so much time on it).  (3) He doesn't blame violent TV, movies, and video games.  He says Japan has more, and they don't shoot each other.  And he spends a segment interviewing Marilyn Manson and trying to convey the point that he's not the reason kids shoot each other.  So we end up at (4) A culture of fear.  We have more gun violence because our TV news focuses so much on violence and fear.  BUT, he admits we have more gun violence.  So that's kind of why it's on TV.  They don't make it up.  So I guess he's arguing that it's a cycle that feeds itself.    But gun violence was high here before the emergence of the mass media and hysterical local newscasts.  And he doesn't present any actual evidence to show that fear spurred on by local newscasts leads people to shoot each other.  And then he spends a chunk of time talking about a 6-year-old who shot a classmate in Michigan.  Because he found a gun at his uncle's house.  I can't find the connection between this and the TV news.    He also takes a segment to blame welfare-to-work programs for gun violence, which I couldn't quite follow -- I guess he was saying that taking parents out of the house gives the kids more time alone to find guns and then go shoot people with them... but why welfare-to-work is different from just normal work isn't clear to me, and it was not at all clear that he was arguing that parents shouldn't work at all.    Nevertheless, despite my problems with the logic, it was thought-provoking and entertaining.  Definitely worth my two hours and ten dollars.  The New York Times liked it too but had similar reservations with the logic.  From their  urlLink review:   "Mr. Moore vacillates between acknowledging their complexity and giving in to his own urge to simplify. He dismisses a number of possible answers out of hand. Is violent popular culture to blame? No, because in a country like Japan, with a tiny fraction of our gun deaths, people consume super-brutal movies, video games and comic books with even more voracity than we do. Poverty? No, since Canada and many European nations have much higher unemployment rates and much lower homicide rates. Is it our history of warfare and brutality? Compared with imperial Britain and Nazi Germany, he suggests, we're downright pacific.    "But each of these assertions rides roughshod over some obvious doubts and qualifications. Unemployment, in countries with more extensive welfare states than ours, is not necessarily the same as poverty, and the wholesale brutality of states and empires engaged in wars of conquest is not the same as the retail mayhem of armed individuals.  "But though he seems to be hunting for a specific historical cause for events like Columbine, Mr. Moore, when it serves his purposes, is happy to generalize in the absence of empirical evidence and to make much of connections that seem spurious on close examination. Several times he notes that the Columbine shootings occurred on the same day as the heaviest United States bombing of the Kosovo war. The more you think about this coincidence, the less it seems to mean."

      Building on yesterday's post about choosing a new seat in Property class...  778 Words About Assigned Seating  Im not sure whether I won or lost the assigned seat lottery this semester.  In both required 1L classes, I was assigned a seat in the back row.  One fictional classmate Im inventing solely for the purpose of writing this column thought I got lucky: I hate sitting in the front, she would have said if she were real.  I feel too exposed.  Too conspicuous.  Too noticeable.  (If she were an exceptionally ironic fictional person, I would point out that she often came to class not wearing any clothes.  But Ill choose instead not to head down that path.)  She also might have mentioned how its much more difficult to fall asleep, play solitaire, or make cell phone calls while sitting in the front row.  Another fictional classmate thought I got the short end of the stick.  I hate being in the back, he said as he practiced raising his hand in preparation for the first day of his elective.  The professor never notices me nodding my head in agreement.  I yawned.  He continued: And, sitting in the front row lets me pretend that its just me and the professor, having a one-on-one conversation.  Like theres no one else in the room.  I tried to interrupt.  But he just kept talking.  Even after I walked away.  Even after the janitor turned off the lights.  Even after the world ended.  After a week of classes, I had gotten used to my back row seats.  And had started to appreciate the people-watching that you can do when youre in the back.  I was getting used to the guy three rows in front of me whos addicted to spider solitaire, but really bad at it.  Used to the girl down the row who stays awake by playing with dust.  And used to the guy across the room who brings animal crackers to class and uses them to put on elaborate animal cracker plays on his desk.  I started naming the plays in my head.  On Monday, I enjoyed Lion goes to the Circus to see the Elephants.  On Tuesday, I watched Three Tigers eat the Zebra, and then visit their good friend, the Giraffe.  And on Wednesday, it was Rooster, Seal, and Boar Hog have a threesome.  But it all came to a crashing halt this past Wednesday, when our Property professor told us hed gotten complaints about how people feel cramped and cant fit their laptops, power cords, casebooks, notepads, wrist supports, foldable keyboards, portable monitors, donuts, coffee mugs and animal crackers on the desks without infringing on their neighbors space.  (My ironic imaginary friend noted that it was especially fitting that people would complain about their personal space in a class about Property.  But, then again, my imaginary friend is also convinced that the Harks Sushi Day came about by accident, when the oven broke and they were unable to finish cooking the flounder with molasses gravy and chunks of blue cheese that was originally on the menu) So, since the back half of the room was empty, he allowed us to come in the next day and pick new seats.   Unfortunately for people who were hoping to get fodder for a super-amusing column about the seat-picking event, it was a fairly calm process. No fistfights over any particular seats, no arguments reminiscent of second-grade class trips when kids fought over whether or not you were allowed to save seats for your best friend, and nobody seemed visibly upset that he had carefully placed himself in the perfect seat and then his arch-enemy came along and sat down right next to him.  (My ironic imaginary friend sometimes wishes he had an arch-enemy.  He thinks it would be cool.)    It sounds fairly pathetic to say, but I actually set my alarm for 10 minutes earlier than usual so I would get to class to make sure I got a good seat, and wouldn't be stuck right behind a compulsive Snood player, next to a compulsive talker, or directly in front of a compulsive projectile vomiter (or is it vomitor?).  In the end, I was giving myself (and my ironic imaginary friend) a headache by thinking so hard about the relatively unimportant choice of seats.  So I left it up to chance.  I called my grandmother and asked her to choose a number between one and a hundred.  She chose 475.  She had forgotten to take her pills.  I asked her again, but spoke more slowly.  She chose molybdenum.  And since molybdenum is number 42 on the periodic table of the elements, I chose seat 42.  (And now theres even room for my ironic imaginary friend to sit next to me!)

      Yesterday in Property class, the professor told us that people had been asking if we could move from our assigned seats and spread out a bit so we have more room -- some people feel cramped by the small desks (can't fit laptop plus textbook without infringing on our neighbor's space... or as we might one day say in property class, if we were the kind of people who made relatively un-amusing comments trying to tie the law into all aspecs of everyday life, crossing the property line between ourselves and our neighbors) and the room has a bunch of empty rows in the back.  So he told us that we could all choose new seats in class today.  Unfortunately for people who were hoping to get a super-amusing weblog post out of this event, it was a fairly calm process.  No fistfights over any particular seats, nobody visibly upset that they had carefully placed themselves in a seat and then their arch-enemy came and sat down right next to them.  It sounds fairly pathetic to say, but I actually set my alarm for 10 minutes earlier tha usual so I would get to class a bit early to make sure I got a good seat and wasn't stuck right behind a compulsive solitaire player, next to a compulsive talker, or directly in front of a compulsive projectile vomiter (or is it vomitor?).  I also actually spent a non-negligible amount of time considering my options -- taking into account that the professor calls on people based on seating location: the right side is at risk of cold-calling on Wednesdays, the center on Thursdays, and the left on Fridays.  Wednesday's class is 20 minutes shorter than the other 2, so that was a plus for the left side.  However, the center is much larger, so the chances of each individual getting called on are quite a bit smaller.    Balancing those two factors -- along with my preference to be off to the side (it's easier to see without other people's heads and laptops getting in the way, especially since the professor tends to walk from side to side quite a bit), I chose the right side, 3 rows back, 1 seat in from the aisle.  I also made sure to take into account the potential pre-class conversation with those around me, and tried to pick a region of the room where other people I'm friendly with were sitting.  ...and my mother says I think too much about the little stuff... :)

I'm stuck with the Law School B For overachievers like me We blame the curve, but still the grade is too low Studied all night Thought I was bright Well I feel so broke up I want to go home  You see all the B-range grades Still there's that sense of shame Thought you could rise above All of the rest, all of the rest I wanna go home, yeah yeah Well I feel so broke up I wanna go home  The gunner, man he got drunk Locked himself in his trunk The white coat men, they came to take him away All 'cause of that B He got in Property, yeah yeah Well he felt so broke up, and now he's gone home  The transcripts they all say B Some of the worst say C All of the students who hoped to make law review cry Let me go home, let me go home I wanna go home, let me go home Why don't you let me go home (Stuck with the law school B) Stuck with the law school B I feel so broke up I wanna go home Let me go home  The justice's son was disowned The one who got an A got stoned Classmates all threw rocks at him cracking his head Then he went home Helping the curve for next time, yeah yeah This is the worst grade a few ever saw  Let's all hold our B's up proud Lowest grade the registrar's allowed We pay tuition -- can't fail!  So we all get Bs Let me go home, let me go home I wanna go home, let me go home Why don't you let me go home

      Coming soon to FOX... "Socratic Idol"  (Lights up on the Supreme Court, and a line of eager law students waiting outside.  Sleeping bags, tents, everybody all bundled up in winter coats.  Studying casebooks.  Piles and piles of casebooks.  Everyone wearing glasses, everyone speed-reading page after page after page.  Emanuels, Gilberts, Casenotes, and every other legal outline imaginable litters the ground.  Ryan Seacrest stands in front with a microphone.)  RYAN SEACREST I'm Ryan Seacrest and we're here outside the United States Supreme Court where over three thousand law students have been lined up, hoping to get an audition for Socratic Idol, the new Fox reality show designed to find the next great legal scholar.  (Ryan walks over towards the mass of people.  He picks one out, curled up in a sleeping bag, using her enormous Langdell coffee mug as a quite-serviceable hat, and reading a Civil Procedure casebook.  She's excited to be on camera.)  RYAN SEACREST What's your name?  LAW STUDENT VIOLET Violet.  Like the color.  RYAN SEACREST Okay, Violet.  And how long have you been waiting out here?  LAW STUDENT VIOLET Five days.  I got here Friday, and it's Monday now.  RYAN SEACREST Uh, okay.  And why are you here at the Socratic Idol auditions?  LAW STUDENT VIOLET Well, Ryan, it's been my dream ever since I was two years old to be the next Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  RYAN You have the looks for it.  VIOLET Thank you.  It all started in elementary school, when I couldn't resist getting into arguments with my classmates.  I even kicked one in the leg once and got taken to court.  After grade school, I debated in middle school, did Mock Trial in high school, and even participated in Moot Court my first semester at law school.  But I'm still waiting for that big break.  I want to get discovered by a great common law judge.  I know I'm ready to be the next Socratic Idol.  RYAN SEACREST Great story.  (Ryan goes down the line a bit more.  The law students are screaming.  He stops at a guy wearing a judge's robe.)  RYAN SEACREST What's your name?  LAW STUDENT TOM Tom.  RYAN SEACREST How long have you been here, waiting in front of the Supreme Court?  LAW STUDENT TOM Since last spring.  My friends raised the money for me to get down here by working an extra hour at their corporate law firms.  They raised seven zillion dollars that way.  And all it cost them were their hobbies and friends.  But I'm here against the wishes of my parents.  They're not supportive of my dream.  RYAN SEACREST They don't want to see their son be the next Socratic Idol?  LAW STUDENT TOM No, this whole law school thing has been a tremendous disappointment for them.  They wanted me to pick a career that was safer, more secure, less predicated on the whims of a few judges, hiring partners, admissions committees and standardized tests.  They wanted me to be a pop singer in a boy band.  But at the Mickey Mouse Club auditions, at the talent shows, at Pete Townshend's open casting call for young boys who want to be stars, and at my voice lessons, I'd always be reading the National Law Journal, briefing circuit court opinions, or practicing my Latin phrases.  Ex ante!  Sua sponte!  Arguendo!  RYAN SEACREST That's exactly the kind of legal jargon our judges are going to want to hear in the auditions.  Good luck.  LAW STUDENT TOM Thanks.  I mean, a habeas corpus to you, Ryan!  RYAN SEACREST Speaking of our judges, let's meet them now.  (Ryan runs down the line and into the Supreme Court building. He passes through the metal detector and it beeps.)  SECURITY GUARD Excuse me, you'll have to step through again.  (Ryan puts down the microphone and walks back through.  It beeps.  The security guard waves the metal detector wand around him a few times.  They find some change in his pocket.  He takes it out, walks through again, and he's fine.  He enters the courtroom, and three judges sit up top, where the Supreme Court justices would normally sit.)  RYAN Here they are.  US District Court Judge Randy Jackson, Supreme Court Justice Simon Cowell, and Traffic Court Judge Paula Abdul.  Randy, what are you looking for in the next Socratic Idol?  RANDY He or she has got to have the whole package.  Broad knowledge of precedent cases, intimate familiarity with legal reasoning, the ability to draw analogies and make connections, lots and lots of Westlaw points, a broken spirit, a neatly written name card, and, of course, a winning smile.  RYAN Paula?  PAULA I'm looking for a law student who can make me want to bang my gavel.  SIMON You're a moron.  PAULA But I'm pretty, Simon.  That's all that matters in jurisprudence anyway.  And I'm so excited to be sitting up here.  I feel just like Diana Ross.  SIMON The Supreme Court, Paula.  Not the Supremes.  PAULA Same thing, Simon.  RYAN Simon, what are you looking for?  SIMON I'm looking for someone special, Ryan.  Not the run of the mill law student, with the decent grades and decent LSAT.  This isn't Socratic Practitioner, or Local Socratic Writing Instructor.  This is Socratic Idol, and the next Socratic Idol has to be someone who can really be a star.  I'm looking for young Antonin Scalias, feisty David Souters, law students with a presence like Sandra Day O'Connor and a confidence like William Rehnquist.  The football skills of Byron White combined with the interpersonal relationship skills of Clarence Thomas.  And the good looks of notable Circuit Court judge Elizabeth Hurley wouldn't hurt either.  RYAN Elizabeth Hurley isn't a Circuit Court judge.  SIMON Well, she should be!  RYAN A tough standard to meet.  But I think we're ready to start.  Bring in the first contestant!  (Law Student Cathy enters, very excited.)  CATHY Oh my god!  I can't believe I'm finally here!  Justice Cowell, I love you!  SIMON That's great, but that's not why we're here.  For that, you can see me after the competition.  I'm wearing nothing under my robe.  RANDY What case will you be answering questions about this morning, Cathy?  CATHY Hawkins v. McGee  PAULA That's one of my favorites.  Good choice.  (Paula pulls out a commercial outline to find the case)  SIMON Okay, let's start easy.  What was Hawkins' first name?  CATHY Uh... Mortimer?  SIMON I'm sorry.  Which hand had the surgery?  CATHY The right?  No, the left.  No, the right!  RANDY Did you actually read the case?  CATHY Yes, yes, I did, I swear.  I'm just nervous.  Give me one more chance.  Let me appeal!  PAULA I'm sorry, honey.  It was a good try.  SIMON That was dreadful.  Simply dreadful.  CATHY But-- But I go to Yale!  SIMON I don't care where you go, that may have been the worst Socratic dialogue I have ever heard.  You're simply not cut out for this.  PAULA Simon, there's no need to be mean.  SIMON I'm not being mean, I'm being honest.  Clearly, she does not have what it takes to be the next Socratic Idol.  CATHY But my law professors---  SIMON Frankly, I think you should sue your law professors if they think you're gonna be able to make a living as a lawyer.  Go back to vocational school, get a job as a bank teller, I don't know.  But you're no lawyer.  Dreadful.  Absolutely dreadful.  You deserve to be trying small claims cases in the smallest small claims court in the smallest county in the smallest state in the smallest country on the smallest planet in the smallest galaxy.  And even there you should really only be a paralegal.  (Cathy exits, her dreams crushed.)  RYAN Next we have Joseph, a 2L from Columbia.  (Joseph enters.  He's got a great smile.)  PAULA Wow.  Joseph.  You certainly have the looks to be a Socratic Idol, no question.  SIMON But will his words be as bright as his smile?  RANDY What case have you prepared for today?  JOSEPH The Bernhard Goetz case, State v. Goetz.  PAULA Criminal law.  Interesting.  RANDY So was it self-defense?  JOSEPH I think we have no choice but to say that it was.  He was genuinely scared, he thought was in danger.  He had no choice but to shoot.  SIMON What about the reasonable person standard?  JOSEPH Only in some jurisdictions.  The Model Penal Code says you just need a subjective belief, not an objective standard here.  RANDY And when he went back and shot the kid again, after he paused and saw he wasn't dead?  JOSEPH Uh... well, that's a tougher call to make...  SIMON Come on, Joseph.  A tougher call?  Give me a break.  There are no tough calls in Socratic dialogue.  You either read my mind or you read the want ads.  Get out of here before I throw this casebook at you.  PAULA Ouch.  SIMON I wasn't actually going to throw it at him, Paula.  PAULA No, I was saying ouch because my brain hurts.  From thinking.  RANDY Look, Joseph, that wasn't bad, man, but I just don't think you're quite ready for the big time.  Another year, perhaps.  It wasn't bad, but you're still young.  A lot of cases ahead of you, a lot of facts, a lot of theories, man.  Legal reasoning, dissent, concurrences, all that jazz, man.  You're just a kid.  PAULA I think maybe criminal law just isn't your genre.  You might want to try torts, or property.  SIMON Why sugar coat it, Paula?  You weren't good enough.  You're not the worst lawyer in the country, but that doesn't make you the Socratic Idol.  You're in over your head.  Go back to state court, Joseph.  I think that's where you belong.  I don't think you're cut out to be dealing with choice of law and complicated issues like that.  Save that for the real champions.  RANDY Don't listen to him, man.  Bone up on your arguments and come back next year and try again.  I see potential.  PAULA And don't lose the essence of you.  Very important to stay within yourself and not try to be a justice you're not.    (Joseph exits, disappointed.)  RYAN Our next contestant is Mary Beth, a 1L all the way from Stanford.  (Mary Beth enters, 3-piece suit, her hair pulled back)  PAULA All the way from Stanford, wow.  SIMON You've got to update the image, Mary Beth.  You're an Eleanor Roosevelt in a Ruth Bader Ginsburg era.  RANDY I don't know.  I like the retro look, if it fits with the case.  PAULA What have you prepared for us?  MARY BETH Nurse v. Barns.  RANDY See?  An old english case.  Perfect with the image.  Nice choice.  SIMON So what kind of damages were we talking about here?  MARY BETH Consequential.  And they were certainly foreseeable, as under Hadley. And easily calculable, as under Dempsey.  An open and shut case.  SIMON What if the expenses were incurred beforehand?  MARY BETH Then it's an Anglia issue.  When measuring expectancy, the timeline doesn't matter.  RANDY And if we were in reliance?  MARY BETH But we're not.  It's distinguishable from every reliance case in the canon.  PAULA I'm impressed.  RANDY Nice job.  SIMON I say pack your bags, you're going to the Senate Confirmation round.   (Mary Beth shrieks in joy)  PAULA Definitely.  RANDY Absolutely.  SIMON See, Mary Beth, you are exactly what this competition is looking for.  A bright young legal mind.  Excellent job.  Finally someone who we wouldn't be embarrassed to call the Socratic Idol.  MARY BETH Oh my god!  Oh my god!  Oh my god!  Justice Cowell, I love you!  RYAN And there we have it, our first contestant going to the next round.  After this commercial break, some more of the worst of legal scholarship, and some of the best.  Stay tuned for more Socratic Idol... here on Fox....  (blackout)

      Apologies if this parts of this make no sense to my non-Harvard Law School readers.  How Bout Some Grades?  Semester two has started.  Only five more sets of finals to go.  Its tough to start a new semester without knowing how we did in the last one.  Tough to evaluate our study habits and decide what worked and what didnt, and how to change it for semester number two.  We may not find out until a month into the new semester that our method of reading only every fifth word in the casebook didnt lead to grades as high as we wished.  Or that the hack into the professors computer and steal the model answers plan went even better than expected and we wont need to go to class at all this time around.  Worst of all, the gunners wont know if theyre allowed to continue being gunners or if some lackluster grades will shock their confidence and render them powerless to continue raising their hands at speeds never seen before law school.  As much as I keep telling myself I dont care about my grades  they wont affect the jobs I can get, Im confident enough in my abilities that my performance on a couple of exams shouldnt matter, just getting into law school should be enough validation  I cant quite fully internalize it.  I care.  I admit it.  But its harder to figure out why.  Maybe its habit.  Weve spent our entire academic lives caring about our grades.  But I think theres more to it than that.  Our grades are basically the only feedback we get  our only chance for approval, a proxy for our professors saying, job well done.  And its sort of tough not to want that.  Of course, the flip side of good grades being a proxy for our professors saying job well done is that not-so-good grades become a proxy for job screwed up pretty bad.  And, given the curve and the fact that everyone here is pretty bright to have gotten in here to begin with, thats probably not really the case.  However, law school gives us only one person to blame if we dont do as well as we might have liked.  The registrar.  Its the registrars fault.  Well, the registrar and the rest of the examination bureaucracy.  For eight reasons (one for each hour of the take-home exams):    1. I didnt get my take-home exam until 7 hours and 45 minutes after the rest of my section did because I was at the end of the exam distribution line. 2. I was rushed in copying my identification number onto the cover sheet, did it wrong, began to cry, and the ink ran off the tear-stained pages, spoiling my exam.   3. The proctor tripped and dropped my computer disk down a sewer grate and I had to re-take the exam.  (She also broke her hip.)  4. The exam drop-off window closed shut on my wrist, slowing my typing ability by 50%. 5. I relied on the e-mail system to send my exam to myself so that I could print it in the library, but at that very moment, all of our e-mail was erased by a mysterious system failure and I had to start over. 6. The fire alarms went off and I stopped, dropped, and rolled right over my laptop, erasing the hard drive. 7.  The bookstore sold me a replacement ink cartridge filled with invisible ink. 8.  My professor determined that my answer to one of the questions was so horribly incorrect that he knew it could only be me who had written it, and therefore I was deemed to have self-identified myself on the exam, and I failed anyway.  Thankfully, exams ended before season 2 of American Idol started.  I think they should do a spin-off called Socratic Method Idol where law students compete to determine who can most accurately read the professors mind.  I think the auditions would be quite amusing.  Or a Joe Millionaire spin-off called Joe Highest Grades Prize.  These twenty-five law firms all think hes won the Highest Grades Prize, but, in fact, he got a low pass in the first-year lawyering workshop.  Boy will they be surprised when he starts work and they discover he cant write a memo!  But, of course, that television show can exist only in our minds, because the law firms (and public interest organizations, and district attorneys offices, and Taco Bell, and anywhere else we might end up working this summer) dont know our grades yet.  Actually, thats the best reason Ive come up with for the professors to take their time.  Come to think of it, if they take another ten months or so to grade the exams, we wont have to worry about them at all.

      For the umpteenth time in as many weeks (that would be umpteen weeks, but who's counting?), Harvard's e-mail server has done something weird, prompting them to (in their infinite wisdom) send us an e-mail saying e-mail isn't working.  Apparently, for some people, their entire set of mail stored on the server was deleted.  For others, mail that they sent never arrived at its destination.  Apparently for me, neither have those have occurred -- and, in fact, I received the e-mail saying e-mail was down, so I'm not really sure what it all means.  And the one e-mail of reasonable importance I sent yesterday (regarding a summer job opportunity) got responded to, so I knw it made it to where it was going.  A haiku about e-mail servers going down:   I am lost e-mail I did not get where I'm sent No one will read me

      Today during torts class, I amused myself by writing a few limericks based on what the professor was talking about.  I'm hoping to make my class notes interesting enough so that I can post them on the Harvard outline library after the semester is done and feel confident that I'll amuse generations of law students to come.  At the very least, I'm probably amusing my seat neighbors.  In the case of Marshall v. Ranne:  There once was a hog who went wild Leaving a farmer beguiled He put out his hand Defense didn't go as planned But at least the hog didn't maul a child  And regarding the recent McDonald's lawsuit:  There once were some people humongous Who lived on this planet among us They loved all-beef patties That turned them to fatties At least the meat didn't have a fungus

      'Twas the night before classes, and all through the dorm Not a student was clicking on Internet porn All the casebooks were open, the highlighters out Every student decoding what each case was about There were briefs being written and outlines to make There was nervousness building in case of mistake There were keyboards a-clicking and disk drives a-whir Opinions dissenting and those that concur There were court names and years on the notes that got made Procedural histories, reasonings weighed There were details and thoughts and some brand new ideas There was music to every professor's two ears Cause the day before classes, it started anew For a brand new semester, the work we would do! We'd resolved to be better, to show up prepared So in case we got called on, our ego'd be spared We'd have pages and pages and pages of notes Filled with case cites and precedent, Justices' quotes But then sitting in classes, the truth would be clear Perhaps it's not worth missing American Idol's premiere The briefs can be shorter, could read with less care As long as the big picture story is there The details for later -- the Daily Show's on The outlines can wait till a few weeks have gone And if I get called on, I'll surely survive Cause February sweeps will be soon to arrive All the great motivation was here for a day A brand new semester; they all start that way.

      The bad thing about having a counter on the weblog is that statistically insignificant changes in the number of readers I get make me draw conclusions.  I have concluded that I must have been funnier last week than I am this week, due to the slight drop-off in average daily hits (and we really are talking statistically insignificant).  Hence, I feel extra-obligated to post something extra-funny.  This is a warning that it's coming later this afternoon.  I don't what it is, but I promise it will be extra funny.  So tell all of your friends.  :)

      I learned all about the differences between pigs, hogs, boars, and swine in Torts class today.  And, in unrelated news, the cafeteria had made-to-order sushi.  But it was really expensive ($5.95 for a roll), so I passed.  Plus, it was the cafeteria, so who can trust the fish?  They probably got an accidental shipment of raw fish -- instead of, I don't know, acorn squash -- and figured they had to do *something* with it.  I have very little faith in the law school cafeteria.  I do, however, have renewed faith in building maintenance, which fixed my slow-draining toilet while I was in class today.  I realize that by writing about sushi, swine, and toilets in the same post, I'm opening myself up to all sorts of odd google searches resulting in a link to my page.  But I really have nothing more interesting to say today.  A quick TV tip: Dave Chappelle's sketch comedy show on Comedy Central last night -- pretty funny.  I recommend.

      Had my new semester classes today.  Well, the two required ones (the elective starts next Wednesday, but mine only meets on Mondays and Tuesdays, so I guess it doesn't start for almost 2 more weeks.  I don't understand the scheduling quirks here.), Property and Torts.  They seem fine.  I can't figure out how to turn the alarm off my watch (I got it for free, so how much can I complain...) -- I had set it initially during exams as a backup, for 7:30 AM, but then it woke me up one morning after exams, so I changed it to 12:00 figuring I wouldn't care if it went off every day at noon.  And I forgot about it.  Until noon today, when I was sitting in class.  It starts beeping.  I immediately fumble around and press every button as fast as I can, simultaneously shutting off the beeping, starting the stopwatch, and resetting the seconds counter.  Five minutes later it starts beeping again.  I think I jumped.  Pressed the buttons again.  Realized that it's going to keep going off every 5 minutes until I let it beep for the full minute.  I don't know why this is.  So for the rest of class -- 4 more 5-minute cycles -- I was vigilant -- VIGILANT, I tell you -- about staring at my watch and watching the second count down until that 5-minute mark, and trying to intercept the beeping by pushing the buttons immediately.  It went okay I guess, except that I was freaking out in my head.  It's not a particularly loud alarm, and I'm in the back row (results of the random assigned seating lottery -- back row in both of my classes), so I'm guessing the professor didn't hear it anyway.  And if he did, he doesn't know who we are yet anyway.  But I really need to figure out how to shut this thing off, which combination of the 4 buttons needs to be pressed so this watch makes no noise ever again.  Or I need to hit it with a hammer.

      2200 words about the summer job search, some of which my loyal readers will recognize, but many of which are brand new:  Truth, Justice, and the Summer Job Search  Id been a law school student for less than a week when I found myself in a crowded lecture hall staring at a PowerPoint slide that read, Introduction to the Summer Job Search.  Already?  I thought I was at law school to avoid looking for a job.  Wasnt that what made law school sound so appealing?  Three more years to figure out what I really wanted to do with my life?      Were not allowed to talk to you yet about finding a summer job, the woman with the permanent smile told us.  The rules are that we cant talk to you until November, and you cant send out any resumes until December 1st.  This is to make sure youre able to focus exclusively on your classes for the first part of the semester.  I took a deep breath and relaxed a bit.  Maybe this wouldnt be so bad.    The woman continued.  We are, however, allowed to talk to you more generally about the kinds of jobs that are out there, and give you some tips on writing resumes and cover letters.  Im passing out a pamphlet we publish every year with some more information.  Id already learned that a pamphlet in law school means something very different than a pamphlet at the doctors office.  On the first day of civil procedure class, the professor asked to turn to page 845 in our federal rules pamphlet.  Everyone looked around, wondering if wed missed the pamphlet distribution session, and what kind of pamphlet could possibly have 845 pages.  It turned out he meant the thick red book wed each spent sixty dollars for in the bookstore.  But I suppose compared to the 1400-page casebook, it was in fact just a pamphlet.   Sure enough, the woman proceeded to distribute a 425-page book listing the address of pretty much every organization in the world thats ever hired a first-year law student, along with sample resumes and cover letters.  Of course, they werent allowed to talk to us about finding a summer job for two more months.  According to the New York Times, students are flooding graduate and law schools with the highest number of applications seen in decades.  A recent article in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette proclaims that across the nation, graduate and professional schools have experienced a surge of interest not seen in nearly a decade as graduating seniors seek refuge from a dismal job market by re-enlisting for another hitch in the academic world.  Seek refuge?  Not quite.  I can say with confidence that going to law school to avoid looking for a job is like going to the rainforest to avoid getting wet.  Here at Harvard, they double the pleasure.  An Office of Career Services for the law firm jobs, and an Office of Public Interest Advising for everything else.  Literally everything else.  As long as its not a law firm.  I get the feeling that I could get public interest funding if I took a job cutting down redwood trees, spilling oil in the ocean, or kicking puppies.  Just because its not a law firm.  At times it feels like the two offices are at war with one another.  Another September meeting joined representatives from both offices together  again, they werent allowed to actually talk to us about finding a summer job; this was merely a meeting to discuss what they would be allowed to tell us once they were allowed to talk.  A tag-team summer job assault, I suppose.  They took turns  the man from career services said that most people go to a law firm, and theres a good reason why.  The woman from the public interest office made a face.  Money isnt everything, she said, and a law firm job isnt for everyone.    But there are many different kinds of law firms, not just the large corporate ones in the big cities.  There are also the medium-sized ones.  But public interest doesnt mean living in poverty.  It might, but it doesnt have to.  There are many fulfilling public interest jobs in cities where the cost of living is low enough that earning $17,000 per year is not that terrible.  Cities like Moscow.  But theres a reason everyone goes to work for a corporate firm.  Its good training.  But its only good training for corporate work.  Theres a temptation to follow the herd, but you dont have to be sucked in.  They make it easy for you.  They come to campus  800 employers a year, for 550 students.  So some walk away empty-handed.  They want you.  Youre smart.  Theyll pay you lots of money.  Its not that bad.  Some people like it.  I met one of them once.  They make it easy for you because if they dont make it easy, no one will go work for them.  And the pay really isnt that good when you factor in that youll be working 120 hours a week.  Eighty, tops.  A hundred.  Ninety?  Ninety-five.  Ninety-two.  And a half.  When youre working ninety-two and a half hours a week doing something you hate---  Remember, you still have over 75 more hours to do something you love.  And to sleep.  Good lawyers dont sleep.  And on, and on, and on.  We left that meeting with two sets of handouts, one lauding the praises of law firm work, and one comparing it to a deal with the devil.  Only the devil doesnt make people defend tobacco companies, insurance companies, oil companies, corporate polluters, former dictators of third-world countries, and Enron.  Actually, the deal with the devil metaphor isnt mine.  It comes from a brochure we received in our mailboxes.  From a law firm.  Its scary enough when the public interest office tells us that law firm work is no fun.  Scarier still when our friends whove already graduated tell us.  But scariest when the law firms themselves say so.  In their promotional materials.  The trend appears to be manipulated honesty.  They admit life at a law firm sucks, but they position themselves ever-so-slightly above the fray.  Yeah, it sucks.  But here at Wealth, Power, and a whole lot of Caffeine it sucks slightly less.  So come work for us.  Please.  Im not exaggerating.  Verbatim from one law firms brochure:   You are about to become a lawyer. Think about it: This may be the last time anyone is totally up front and 80 percent honest with you.  As a first year, you may feel like a fire hydrant. Here, at least you're a well-respected fire hydrant.  [Our] Summer Associate Program: Glamorous work, lavish meals, theatre tickets. Your basic deal with the devil.  Now that's something you don't often hear in the halls of a law firm: Laughter.  In closing, we know you have a choice. So let's talk about our cafeteria.  As the day when career services was actually allowed to talk to us approached, law schools delicate balance between classes and the job search began to tip.  As if a big bag of gold coins fell on one side of the scales of justice.  On November 1, resume workshops began.  They instructed on the Harvard Law School resume template, where every resume looks the same, and every student is equally qualified.  Anything not legal sounding  any jobs not involving grueling hours of research, any extracurricular activities that dont have the word law in them, any hobbies like the sport in which you won an Olympic Gold medal  gets shunted off into a section on the bottom called interests, or personal.    Frankly, I find it offensive for them to say that one persons published book is of equal worth and should be treated the same on the resume as another persons interest in watching reality television. Yet thats the advice.  On December 1, when people were finally allowed to send out resumes, it was like a holiday.  A holiday for the post office, actually.  Classmates racing to the mailboxes at seven in the morning so that their envelopes would be among the first batch sent out, and among the first batch received by the law firms.  As if on December 3, a firm would say, well, weve waited two whole days for these resumes to come in  I guess we should probably make our choice today.    One of my friends stamped confidential on all of his envelopes, so that the secretaries wouldnt open them and throw them away.  I asked him if he thought a working lawyer might be bothered by the fact that his confidential mail was simply a resume from a law student and throw it out, and whether it might be better for the secretary to open it, since she probably had a whole pile of resumes she was collecting.  He didnt think my reasoning made any sense.  After all, why wouldnt a lawyer want to read his resume?  He does, after all, go to Harvard Law School.    A bunch of firms came to campus for a job fair.  However, none of them were hiring first year students.  They were here in preparation for next year  so we would remember their names and send them our resumes for a second-year summer job.  As if anyone did actual research on individual firms and didnt just use the mail merge files that we were provided for each major city.    Actually, there was a competition to be one of the people on the mail merge verification committee.  The opportunity to call the firms, speak with the recruiter to verify the mailing address  and introduce yourself so she knows your name  seemed too great to pass up for lots of people.  Anyway, it seemed as if the real goal of the firms at the job fair was to bribe us for our resumes.  They had glossy brochures, pens, highlighters, mouse pads, keychains, yo-yos, t-shirts, bookmarks, calendars, and stress balls to distribute (the entire Oriental Trading Company catalog, in full color).  The choice to distribute stress balls seemed a bit odd  was it a subtle admission of what life at a law firm would actually be like?  The American Civil Liberties Union also came to the job fair.  The one public interest organization with a budget for tchotchkes, I guess.  Although  and I am not making this up  they were giving away condoms.  From a distance they looked like little cream cheese containers, like you get on an airplane.  I was assuming they had run out of bagels, and were just left with the spreads. I'm glad I didn't ask them about the bagels, because it wasn't cream cheese. And I'm not sure that a bagel and a condom makes for a good snack.   I was left to wonder why the ACLU would decide to give out condoms at a career fair. What career were they pushing? Does taking a bunch of free condoms make you a more attractive potential lawyer? Hey, you taking all the condoms  looks like you'd be perfect around the office especially with our Christmas party coming up.  Can I see your resume?  A typical week in December had 19 career-oriented events we could attend  according to the handy career calendar on the career services web site.  The nicest web site of any department at Harvard, probably underwritten by a law firm or two.  Panel discussions, exploratory workshops, meet-and-greets, receptions, and on and on and on.  More choices than the course catalog has classes.  But, then again, more potential payoff than a two-hour lecture about the federal rules of evidence.  I suppose the real truth is that pretty much everyone came to law school to get a job, and so this really is what were paying for.  And Ill concede that the idea of being employable is a nice one, especially in this economy.  But did it have to start so early?  Is this really what law school is supposed to be about?    Maybe my problem isnt that theres such a focus on getting a job, but that theres more of a focus on the mechanics of it than of finding the job thats right for each person.  I know more about how to get hired by a law firm than what lawyers at law firms actually do.  I know more about the difference between cotton fiber resume paper and white linen resume paper than about the difference between corporate practice and litigation.  I know more about what to wear to an interview than why Im even going.  By this time next year, most of my classmates will already be hired for our second-year summer jobs, most of which will lead to full-time offers, and most of which will be accepted before the third year of law school even begins.  Meaning that most of law school will have been spent already employed.  So they start early.  But if the goal is for us to really make informed decisions, for us to really discover what aspect of the law motivates us, inspires us, makes us passionate, maybe they start too early.  They should at least wait until the second week of school.

      From Rotoworld.com:  Tony Delk - G - Boston Celtics  Jan 17  Tony Delk returned to action tonight, but he didn't start and played just 15 minutes.  J.R. Bremer got another start at point guard for Boston. Although Bremer looked good while Delk recovered from a sprained ankle, Delk likely will get his starting job back next time out.    This is what being in a fantasy basketball league does to a person.  I actually CARE whether Delk gets his starting job back, because he's on my team. Three months ago, I had never heard of Tony Delk, didn't know what a point guard was, and couldn't have told you whether 15 minutes was a lot of time to play in a basketball game, or just a little (although I probably would have guessed correctly on that one).  But now I know all about blocks and centers and steals and 3-point shooting percentage.  More than I need to know.    Excuse me while I check the box scores to see whether Nene Hilario has fouled out for the second day in a row.  (The moral of the story: if you either (a) are woefully ignorant about a major sport but wish you weren't, or (b) have twenty minutes a day to kill setting your lineup, checking the waiver wire, and closely scrutinizing box scores, join a fantasy league!)

      In the student mailboxes: a small green booklet from a corporate law firm.  The trend in law firm promotional materials continues -- they all appear to be trying the same thing.  Acknowledge that working at a law firm is not that thrilling, but make themselves appear to rise slightly above the fray.  They're spinning us.  And, oddly enough, reading this little green booklet makes me want to work for their advertising firm instead of their law firm, because they really are trying here.  These are directly out of the brochure:  "You are about to become a lawyer.  Think about it: This may be the last time anyone is totally up front and 80 percent honest with you."  "As a first year, you may feel like a fire hydrant.  Here, at least you're a welll-respected fire hydrant."  "The [Firm's name] Summer Associate Program: Glamorous work, lavish meals, theatre tickets.  Your basic deal with the devil."  "Now that's something you don't often hear in the halls of a law firm: Laughter."  "In closing, we know you have a choice.  So let's talk about our cafeteria."  If every other firm weren't trying the same messaging, I'd almost believe them.  It would be a fresh, new approach, and I'd appreciate their honesty.  But not when every other brochure is saying the same stuff.  I'm exaggerating.  Half the firms are trying this "hip" (I bet that's what they think it is) approach.  The other half are doing it the more traditional way: by sending us materials designed to frighten us.

      Time for another song.  How about an end-of-exams song!  (...starts off like a ballad...)   I spotted all the issues Or at least I hope I did Looked in every corner of the fact pattern where they hid  I took my pile of outlines Made with tender loving care And now that exams are over, threw them in the dumpster over there...  (...and picks up tempo...)  They're over Exams are over Take that term of jurisdiction And pretend that it was fiction Forget all the little details About merchants, goods, and resales Don't lose sleep over that murder Cause it's not a crime you've heard of... anymore Exams are over and the books are off the floor ...and in a drawer ...or in the trash ...or sold for cash ...or out the window as they smash ...onto than man and leave a gash ...is it a crime? is it a tort? ...who knows? who cares? take me to court! ...but i don't know because exams are finally done ...and it's time to start the fun... of next semester.  (...back to the ballad...)  Explained it with precision Hit the word count on the dot But the moment it was over, all law I forgot  They say do no post-mortems Don't re-check, re-think, reflect I can't go back regardless, because the spine of all my casebooks is now wrecked...  (...pick up tempo again...)  They're over Exams are over Take the statutes and their sections Leave them for the trash collections Take the study guide you saved for Ask what have you been enslaved for Now you're free from all the study No more casebook is your buddy... not today Exams are over and so now it's time to play ...perhaps to pay ...for all the books ...the bookstore crooks ...say you will need for class that starts ...in just five days when break departs ...and then it all comes back again ...when will it end? when? when? when? when? ...cause after school we'll all get jobs and they're no fun! ...so what's the point of being done... when all that we have won... ...is another semester... of... this.

      Finished!  Finished.  A whole semester of law school, done.  Following the slowest week in the history of the universe.  It feels like the first exam was five weeks ago, not five days ago.  And that winter break was three winters and a very brisk fall ago.  Its weird to remember how much more important this all felt a week ago.  Before exam number one, as much as I didnt want to admit it to myself, I was kind of concerned.  Felt like a fairly major event  I went to sleep early, made sure to go to the bathroom the night before so I wouldnt have to go during the take-home and lose valuable time (admit it, someone out there thought about hooking up a catheter), did all the practice exams.  By exam number three it was just like any other day in the life of a law student.  I even decided to only set one alarm instead of the three  clock, cell phone, and TV auto-turn-itself-on-really-loud-to-the-Spanish-channel  Id set for exam number one.  And exam number three seemed so much harder to get motivated to study for  after the first two, I knew that regardless of how I did, I probably wasnt going to completely explode upon reading the questions or anything like that.  I bet that if they compared students work from exam number one to exam number three, across sections and across classes, theyd find a tremendous dropoff in quality.  Theres tension at the beginning, as much as we dont want to feel it.  By the end, were old pros.  By next semester, well be going out for lunch in the middle of 8-hour take-homes and waiting at the door of Pound 335 at 3:30 for them to start collecting them.  Or maybe not.  The one good thing about exams is that they provide a whole bunch of new things about law school to make fun of.  Like proctors.  Boston accent and Medicare card required.  Its not they arent well-intentioned.  But did it occur to anyone that the best people to deal with potential problems with laptops and computer disks in exam rooms might not be the elderly?  When I have a problem saving a file to disk, my grandmother is not the first person I call.  Someone asked if he could burn his file onto a CD, and the proctor said there would be no matches allowed in the exam room.  Okay, not really.  And that wasnt even funny.  What the proctor actually said was that in the event of someone burning his file onto a CD, the fire alarm would sound and we should all proceed to carefully save our work, shut down our laptops, and exit the building and await further instructions.  In that order.  So the building is engulfed in flames, but priority number one is saving our work to disk.  At least risk-of-fire is an argument against having us write the answers in bluebooks  made of paper.  But perhaps thats the only argument against it.  There doesnt seem to be a reason why, for an open-book exam, we need to write it in-class on our laptops and then hand in a disk anyway.  Instead of taking it home and printing it out like the 8-hour exams.  Or even e-mailing it.  Its as if someone decided, hey, lets let them write their exams on computers.  Computers are fun! and that was the entire extent of the thoughtful planning process.  But that alone might have made it a more carefully considered plan than the take-home exam distribution madness.  Again, if I want to efficiently run a process that involves people reading the small numbers on our ID cards and matching them to small numbers on a printed sheet, my grandmother is not the first person I would call.  No, the first person I call would be her neighbor, who has cataracts, glaucoma, and two eye patches (but still drives at night).  Having every section come get their exams from the same room at the same time may not have been my first decision either when planning the process.  Im surprised we didnt get the fire alarm speech there too, considering the amount of people in Austin Hall was certainly a violation of the fire code.  In case the fire alarm should sound, please remain in line and wait your turn.  After you receive your exam, you may proceed to the nearest exit, and stop, drop, and roll.  If you leave the line before it is your turn, you will need to go to the back of the line and begin again.  Couldnt they just e-mail the exam to us at 8:30 in the morning?  Were all headed back to our computers anyway.  So now that were done, its all supposed to be a big relief, right?  Sell our casebooks back to the Coop for seventy-one cents each, burn our class notes in a big bonfire  or is that burn the files with our class notes onto a CD?  I forget.  Ill ask my grandmother.  She knows all about computers.  But seriously, is it really a relief?  It all just starts over again.  And Ive still got a summer job to find.  Maybe, if I put on a gray wig and borrow a walker, I can get work as a proctor.

      I bet that if the exam responses from Exam #3 were compared with those from Exam #1 -- across classes, across schools, across professors -- that the answers to exam #1 would be so much better.  It just seemed so much more... more crucial to be ready for that first-ever law school exam.  I went to bed at 10:00, I made sure to go to the bathroom the night before so I wouldn't have to go during the exam, I was meticulous about my studying, did all the practice exams, really felt ready.  Because it really felt important.  But now, by exam #3, I feel like I'm an old pro.  Exams? Eh, I know all about exams....  No idea how I did, but still, it just feels like there's so much less pressure, it feels less... less crucial... to really be as prepared as for the previous ones.  And everyone else I've talked to -- regardless of what class the exam is in, what professor they have, whether it's an in-class or a take-home -- seems to feel the same way.  Just an observation.

      Where do they find the proctors for our exams?  Do they put an ad in the newspaper?  WANTED: Retired people who like to sit.  Must be able to manage room filled with 80 students, most of whom haven't slept in a week and aren't all that relaxed to begin with anyway.  Must be able to read small print (bring your glasses!) on student ID cards and match the numbers to those on a sheet.  Ability to read basic instructions aloud without mangling sentences to the point of incomprehension is a plus.  Finally be able to put law school on your resume and impress all of your friends.  For more information, log onto our website... uh... that won't work... for more information, send us a telegraph at (617) 123-4567.  Positions filling up quick, but there's still room on the wait list.  Pleasant personality and basic grooming habits not required.

      10 piles of paper on my floor, 2 casebooks, and a study guide.  Learning everything on those pages in the next 24 hours is all that stands between me and a semester completed.  Criminal Law.  If all else fails, the answer is: "the Court would probably rule that he is guilty, but may be swayed the other way by an argument that his rights were violated."

      Recuperating from civil procedure exam.  Or, as my civil procedure exam would say, "Assume you have just spent eight hours staring at a computer screen typing words upon words upon words (as in Exam-taking).  Dinner (D) is tempting, but Sleep (S) is tempting as well.  Studying (St) for Wedensday's (W) Exam (E) is less tempting (T).  Watching (W) the Real World-Road Rules Challenge (RWRRC) is most tempting (T) of all (A).  Papaya (P) Banana (B) Ceiling (C) Elephant (E) Unrelated Words (UW).  Write a memo (M), 1300 words, only 2100 vowels allowed total, pretending you are a law clerk (LC) to Justice Bob, and addressing wahtever issues (I) are relevant (R) to this discussion (D).

      Five (serious) tips for taking law school exams.  (I'm writing them down mostly so I can go back and read them tomorrow while I'm taking my Civil Procedure exam...)  1. Relax.  Breathe.  Eight hours is a long time.  You don't need to rush. 2. The answers are there somewhere.  Everything they're testing on is based on something you've learned.  There are issues hidden in the question somewhere.  All you need to do is find them. 3. Thoughts, not conclusions.  Don't dismiss things because they're obvious or tangential.  Mention them.  Think about them.  Deal with them. 4. Puzzle it out.  The easy answer may not be the right answer.  How is this the same as some cases you've seen?  How is it different?  What's the crux of the issue? 5. Relax. Breathe.  Eight hours is a long time.  You don't need to rush.

[dream sequence music, please]  [Lights up on a beach filled with female law students.  And one man.  Not a handsome man.  Not a rich man.  Not a charming man.  But a man with a handful of paper.]  MAN: I'm Joe Final-Exam-Answers.  And I have the answers to your final exams.  GIRL 1: Ooh!  Joe Final-Exam-Answers!  I love you!  GIRL 2: I've always dreamed of being with a guy... who had the exam answers.  Joe, I can fulfill your every fantasy... if you can tell me how to test for personal jurisdiction.

      One exam down, two to go.  And let's not kid around: taking a one-hour in-class closed book short answer exam (1/3 of my grade) immediately followed by the six-hour take-home open book essay portion of the exam (2/3 of my grade) is not so much fun.  Where did the day go?  Draining.  Very draining.  And an eight-hour take-home awaits me on Monday.  Fun stuff.

      Five Time-Saving Tips for Peak Performance on Timed Take-Home Exams  1. Put your lunch in a blender and suck it up with a straw, freeing your hands to continue typing even while you eat. 2. Spread the pages of your outline on the floor in a single layer of paper, eliminating the time-consuming task of turning pages. 3. Unplug your phone, TV, internet connection, refrigerator, hot water heater, lamp, and hairdryer.  No reason to risk a fire during thr exam. 4. Have your parents tell your friends that you're dead so they don't interrupt you during the exam. 5. No need to waste time going to the bathroom! Use a catheter!

      Here They Come!  I suppose I have no choice but to write about exams, given that its been hard to think about anything but for the past few days.  Practice tests are instruments of the devil.  Its cruel and unusual punishment to make ourselves take practice tests.  Are prisoners on death row forced to take practice tests?  Sit in the chair just for practice.  Strap you in just for practice.  Well flick the switch just for practice.  Sit there, get some electricity through you and well let you out just before weve turned the dial up too high.  But dont forget to take a look at these model results of what itll look like when you get the real thing.  Itll make you sleep easier at night.  Ive come up with a list of 25 things not to do the night before an exam.  Other writers may have been able to come up with as many as ninety, some as few as four.  The mean is probably around 15, but only answers that incorporated substantive policy discussion were able to reach beyond that and score in the 30s.  Oops.  Im copying language from a model answer for a practice test.  Forgive me.  Heres the list.  1. Install reverse-antivirus-software on your computer 2. Try a new antihistamine 3. Take part in a sleep-deprivation experiment 4. Watch any show on UPN (itll lower your IQ) 5. Smash your laptop to bits 6. Play with your roommates shotgun 7. Burn your casebook 8. Remove the batteries from your alarm clock 9. Rinse out your disk drive 10. Spray pepper spray in your eyes 11. Stop breathing 12. Begin making a course outline 13. Drink 14. Drink bleach 15. Drink bleach followed by fabric softener (remember, its fabric softener *before* bleach!) 16. Tie your shoes together 17. Forget how to read 18. Sleep under the stars (and over the ice) 19. Go orienteering without a compass 20. Undercook your chicken 21. Handcuff yourself to your bed 22. Swallow a bottle of laxatives 23. Learn how to use a chainsaw 24. Buy some invisible ink toner for your printer 25. Make a list of 25 things not to do the day before an exam in lieu of studying (shoot!)  It would be fun if exams were written in the style of a Choose Your Own Adventure story.  Annie Ames files a suit in federal court after being hit by a bus in her hometown of Cleveland, Ohio.  The bus was driven by Howard Dean, who in his spare time fancies himself a viable candidate for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination.  It was a bus headed from Miami, Florida to Portland, Maine.  The long way.  It was operated by United Airlines.  Because their airplane business went bankrupt.  If the court can exert personal jurisdiction, go to Question 2.  If not, got to Question 3.  Question 2.  Oops.  Annie Ames has fallen into a manhole on the way to court.  She lands in Panama City, and expresses an intention to remain there indefinitely.  She marries Billy Backwoods, half-Brazilian and half-New Hampshirite.  When they divorce, should the witch doctor who oversees the divorce proceeding use Panama law, or the law of Singapore, where the witch doctor was born and still owns property in.  If Panama, go to question 4.  If Singapore, youve been caned and your story is over.  Hand in the exam or return to the beginning and choose a new path.  That seemed like a funnier idea to me before I wrote it.  Oh well.  In any event, heres 10 more things not to do the night before an exam:  1. Contract Lyme disease 2. Play hide and seek with your contact lenses 3. Begin outlining for your spring semester classes 4. Let a friend borrow your cerebellum 5. Do-it-yourself home enema kit 6. Translate your class notes into pig latin 7. Turn the thermostat up as far as it will go and try to sweat off those last few holiday pounds 8. Finally take that pregnancy test youve been planning on taking 9. Reformat your hard drive 10. Make a list of 10 more things not to do the night before an exam.  Damn!  Thats all, folks

That I found this page is evidence that I should be spending more time studying.

      Found something funny at one of the websites I find myself visiting way too often for my own good --  urlLink Baseball Primer  -- basically a message board about baseball news and articles.  There's a thread about yesterday's Hall of Fame election of Gary Carter and Eddie Murray, and someone posted a quote from Eddie Murray:  He had just gotten glasses, fairly late in his career, and someone asked him if he'd noticed anything different since he began wearing them, and he said something like, "I noticed there's a lot of ugly people in the stands."  That's pretty funny.  And in case you're looking for a couple more websites to make you less productive:  urlLink Television Without Pity  and  urlLink TV Tattle  -- recaps and forums about TV shows at the first, news about TV at the second.

      Three quick thoughts to ponder: 1. Starbucks is really in the whipped cream business, not the coffee business.  (Actually, they're really in the real estate business...) 2. Trent Lott will run for president in '04 on the Dixiecrat ticket. 3. Snow is prettiest right before it hits the ground.

      E-mail sent by Career Services:  Charting Your Legal Future For First-Year Students of Color Tuesday January 28, 2003.  Refreshments will be served. Topics will include life as a lawyer, practicing in Boston, job search and more.  Interested students can sign-up....  Two points: (1) Are topics like "life as a lawyer" and "practicing in Boston" really different for "students of color" than for "students of no color" (or whatever the appropriate opposite term is)  If they are, I think that would make a more interesting discussion than the topics themselves. (2) Is "students of color" a term that people are happy with?  It seems like it's just trying way too hard to be non-offensive, at the cost of being fairly vague and silly-sounding.

      My short study break to get dinner has turned into my short study break to get dinner, watch a fascinating (yeah... sure...) 60 Minutes segment on the guy who edits the NY Times crossword puzzle, motivating me to go online and try (and fail) to do the free NY Times crossword puzzle from the archives, watch "Becker," perhaps the least entertaining show I've seen... all day... and now I'm halfway through the "King of Queens."  And "Andy Richter Controls the Universe," which is actually funny, is on at 9:30, so I won't be returning to my short issue-spotting contracts outline until after that.  To justify that paragraph of relatively self-absorbed uninteresting details of the last two hours of my life, I need to write something really funny now so you actually return to the weblog tomorrow for more.  How about... a brief Choose Your Own Adventure law school story.  Chapter 1: Harold is a law school student with exams coming up soon.  He opens his contracts casebook.  If you think Harold should study, go to chapter 2A.  If you think Harold should throw it in the fireplace, go to chapter 2B.  Chapter 2A: Harold tries to study, but falls asleep from the boredom.  He dreams of a happier time, when he was studying Astrology at Vassar.  He wakes up and looks at the clock.  If you want the clock to have moved ahead by 1 hour since Harold opened his book, go to chapter 3A.  If you want the clock to have moved ahead by a week, and it is now 5 minutes before Harold's contracts exam, go congratulate yourself on screwing Harold's future... and go to chapter 3B.  Chapter 2B: Harold tosses the book in the fireplace and it catches fire.  The fire alarm goes off.  The fire inspectors come and arrest Harold.  Then they realize they're not really police officers, so they let him go, but they issue him a $50 fine.  To pay the fine, Harold sells his Criminal Law book back to the university bookstore.  But that only gives him 71 cents.  To get the rest of the money, Harold takes a job with a corporate law firm specializing in international interjurisdictional interpleader cases.  I don't really know if those three words make sense together.  Neither does Harold.  Two years later, he throws himself into the fireplace.  The end.  Chapter 3A: Harold can't believe he's only been asleep for an hour.  He decides to make up the time by spending $6 on a venti vanilla latte at Starbucks mixed with Red Bull and Mountain Dew so he has enough caffeine to stay awake all night.  His brain explodes.  All over his contracts book.  So even if he could still read without his brain (and he thinks thats probably what he was doing before anyway), the pages are all dirty.  He sells the book back to the bookstore and gets 71 cents.  And fails his exam.  And, now brain-less, goes on a reality TV show and wins the fame and fortune that all reality TV participants are after.  The end.  Chapter 3B: Harold runs to his exam, but trips and falls in the snow.  Oops.  As he tries to get up, his classmate Susan, also running to the exam, trips over him and falls.  Their eyes lock.  It's love at first sight.  They decide to skip the exam, drop out of law schooll, get married, and live happily ever after.  Working at Starbucks.  The end.

      A conversation I've been having too much since I got back from break:  ME: How was break? OTHER PERSON: Awful.  Really awful. ME: Oh.  Guess they did more studying than me.  Or at least found the studying they did to be more distasteful.  It's kind of disarming to ask a friendly question about how someone's break went and get such a strong answer.  Like if you ask someone how he's feeling and he tells you something really personal about his sinuses or his gastrointestinal system.  ME: Hey.  How's it going? OTHER PERSON: Constipated. ME: Oh.

      Working on an optional practice exam question for my Criminal Law class -- the professor gave us the option of answering a sample question, sending him our reponse, and we would get feedback.  It certainly can't hurt -- the more practice, the better.  And hopefully the feedback will provide some sense of what a professor is looking for in an answer to an exam question.  Other than that, it's cold in Boston.  But I expect that will be the case for a few months now...  Five Signs That It's Cold Outside 1. The pile of snow is wearing a winter coat.  2. Instead of hot dogs, street vendors are selling gloves. 3. Santa Claus is wandering around looking very lost.  And shivering. 4. Mugger: "Your money... or your hat." 5. You don't notice that the bowl of hot soup you're eating is actually a bowl of ice cream.

      If I was writing a stand-up comedy act:  "My grandmother went to a New Years Eve party with some of her friends -- they ate dinner at 6 and she was home by 10.  She didn't understand when I told her that sort of defeats the purpose of a New Years Eve party."  I'm reading the latest issue of Harvard Magazine, available free in a big stack near the law school mailboxes.  Here's a brief tour of the highlights.  There's an article about a recent academic conference regarding chimpanzee rights: "[Several speakers] compared the chimpanzees' situation with that of slaves in nineteenth-century America. Going even further, [one speaker] drew an analogy to Nazi Germany: 'We abuse animals to make ourselves feel better, and we justify it,' he said -- just as the Nazis justified their attacks on Jews and the mentally retarded."  Uh okay  Four pages later, from an article about a lawyer-turned-food critic: "What we need... is a system of graduated fines and perhaps short jail sentences to discourage the production of totally depressing baked goods."  If I was a professor and I read that quote, Id really be tempted to turn it into an exam question.  The legislature in the state of Ames has decided to make the production of inferior baked goods a crime.  Starbucks sues the government, challenging the constitutionality of the law.  The only other cases in the jurisdiction are Hawkins v. McGee and Erie.  Discuss in 700 words or less.    From an ad: "Yoshiko offers hand fabricated jewelry." Does hand fabricated mean it's all in your hand's imagination?    From another ad: "The combination youve been waiting for. Single-family style living. For age 62-plus." Not the combination I've been waiting for.  In fact there are ads for at least five different elderly housing communities in the magazine.  I guess thats the readership of Harvard Magazine.  They all call themselves different things: "retirement community," "accredited life care community," "assisted living retirement community," "life-care retirement," and, "where you go when youre done with all that being alive stuff."  The Harvard Calendar announces a "Mineral Madness Family Festival" at the Museum of Natural History along with a "drop-in winter scavenger hunt."  Mineral madness?  Ooh!  Sign me up!  An interesting article about liberal political essayist Hendrik Hertzberg that has not one line in it that I can take out of context and make seem either stupid or funny. A very good read, actually. In all honesty, Harvard magazine seems like a great example of what an alumni magazine can be. The Princeton Alumni Weekly, which I get in return for my four years of undergraduate tuition, is a less great example, usually featuring a cover story about Princeton's new Director of [Fill in the Blank -- Public Safety, Financial Development, Janitorial Services, Undergraduate Binge-Drinking, Cafeteria Waste Distribution], an article about some big lacrosse game that took place eight months ago, and pages upon pages of death notices.  But back to the Harvard magazine. "When I conceived Barbie... I believed it was important to a little girl's self-esteem to play with a doll that has breasts." I swear I am not making that quote up. Page 47, if you don't believe me.  "Harvard's fiscal year 2002 revenues and expenses yielded the $70.4 million surplus... given the immediate situation, said [the VP of finance], Harvard's schools are 'very conscious of the need to moderate expense growth tremendously.'" I guess $70.4 million isn't enough?  "Though she calls him 'an inspiration and role model like no other,' [female basketball player] Hana Peljto's uniform number [23] was not chosen to match Michael Jordan's." And in related news, the forty-three cents in my pocket has no relation to the fact that George Bush is our forty-third President.  In an advertisement for Harvard's Office of Gift Planning: "One really can't help being caught up in what's going on with Harvard's libraries." Is that really the best they can do? I can think of at least ten better reasons to give money to Harvard than to help make the libraries better. In fact...  Ten Better Reasons to Give Money To Harvard Than to Help Make the Libraries Better 10. The 2002 surplus of $70.4 million makes you worried about Harvard's future. 9. The Rockefellers refused your help and you were looking for an equally impoverished place to give money to. 8. Coming soon: The "In Memory of John Smith" handicapped bathroom stall. 7. If only the water fountains dispensed champagne... 6. No more room under the bed for your wads of cash. 5. Better return than the stock market. 4. Yale rejected you. This is your form of payback. 3. No real passion about giving money to help doctors find a cure for anything. 2. Already sponsoring every child in Africa. Now just need a college for them all to go to. 1. Meant to write "Heart Association" on check; bad penmanship made it look like "Harvard"  In the classifieds section: "Cambridge furnished apartment. Two bedrooms, two baths. Perfect for visiting professor." Huh? Too small for a tenured professor?  And, finally, the personals. "A younger dark-haired more radiant Jane Fonda. Thin, smart, stunning... stands out in a crowd." Doesn't say modest. Another ad: "...written children's book for 9-11 families..." Yes, I know what she probably means, but wouldn't it be funny if she actually meant her children's book sold about 10 copies?  Okay, that's all I've got today.  Hope this was at least semi-entertaining.

      Happy New Year!  My plan was to write a quick limerick about heading back to Boston tomorrow to finish studying for exams.  But the best I could up with was:  I go back to Boston tomorrow The best rhyme for this line is sorrow I will ride a big bus Perhaps the driver's name will be Gus And get ready for my exam horror.   And pretend that horror and tomorrow rhyme  And that's not very good at all.  But fortunately I read the Jan. 1 post of a fellow law-student weblog writer (see  urlLink this other weblog ) and it strikes me enough that I can probably just write a paragraph or two reacting to it.  So, after this long introduction, that is what I will do.  In case you don't want to click over and read his post, basically he says (and I apologize if I'm not doing his post justice -- it contains lots of big words like "chimerical" and "ephemeral" that, to be perfectly honest, I don't really know exactly what they mean)  that most people he's seen have been panicking over law school exams but he's not because he sees exams as big fantasy monsters who scare people but only if they let themselves be scared.  And I suppose I certainly agree with his conclusion -- that everyone who came before us has survived and there's no reason to panic -- but I'm really not into this whole "exams as monsters" analogy.  Exams are exams.  Everyone who's gotten to law school has taken lots of exams already and has probably done pretty well on them.  Of a world of glib responses I could choose to give when people ask me how law school is, my favorite is "school is school."  Because I really believe that's true.  Law school is not terribly different from undergrad.  You read, you write, you go to class, you do extracurriculars, you make friends.  And you take exams.  We've done all this before, we're good at it.  They're just exams.  So you study, you do your best, and they're done.  They're not monsters, they're some questions the professors have written to see how well you know the material.  If you learned the right stuff and have a good day, you do well.  If not, you do less well.  But everyone coming out of law school has his or her pick of jobs, and no one has to live in a cardboard box because he got a B-minus in torts.  So calling them monsters -- even if you say you're not really scared of them and they're just pretend monsters -- I think just feeds into the whole idea that exams are somehow these awful things we have to conquer and overcome.  They're just exams.  I'm not denying that I've been spending time studying, or that I'd rather do well than do poorly, but really everyone here has already taken enough exams and done well enough academically over the course of enough years that we should all have enough self-worth to know that no matter what we get, we're all fairly bright people, and a B-minus doesn't mean anything except you didn't write a particularly good response to this particular set of questions.   The last sentence of his post reads "Ill leave my panicking for the workplace, when large sums of real dollars are at stake, and Im responsible for them."  Sigh.  You know what, I'll leave my panicking for when I find myself falling out of an airplane without a parachute, or I have a wife and kids and they get sick.    I'm imagining that for most jobs that deal with large sums of real dollars they feel like abstract sums of fake dollars anyway.  Sigh.

      We've had grades for two weeks now, and still, the "grades are random" / "no they're not" conversation pops up pretty often.  I'm tired of not having anything of any value to contribute on the subject, so I'm hoping that writing about it will at least help me figure out my thoughts.    My opinion: they're not exactly random.  I have full confidence that professors are able to rank exams in terms of how well students answered the questions and create a pretty accurate ordering.  The real trouble occurs on two levels: (1) where to draw the lines between grades, and (2) what the exams are measuring.  (1) is an unavoidable hazard.  The lines have to be drawn somewhere.  Some exams have to be on the border and fall one way or the other.  And even though there's a pretty big difference between an A- and a B+, or a B+ and a B, I'm willing to accept the reality that your exam might be 1% worse than the one slightly better, and you get a grade that looks a lot more than 1% just because there are only 5 (maybe 6 or 7, depending on whether the A+ or the C are in play) different grades you can get.  (2) is at first glance slightly more troubling, just because measuring us once, on one set of questions, on one day, and through one professor's eyes, is hard.  And people have off days.  And maybe it's measuring test-taking ability as much as it is subject knowledge.  And maybe some people are better at faking it.  And maybe there's luck in whether you spend your limited word count on the things the professor wants you to write or you focus on other issues that may be equally interesting and valuable but just aren't what's being looked for.  And those are all good arguments.  But on the flipside is the thought that in the real world, all of those skills that help you "beat the test" can help you "beat the judge" or "beat your boss" and it's not so absurd to be grading on them -- maybe people who can fake an answer that convinces a law professor they know what they're talking about can fake a judge into thinking his client is right.  A valuable lawyering skill.  Maybe clear presentation that overcomes lack of content isn't necessarily something bad to reward.  Maybe knowing, or at least being able to sense, what someone is looking for, even when there are lots of things you can choose to focus on, is a valuable lawyering skill.  Maybe being able to shine even on an off-day is something they should want to encourage in the grading process.  So I'm not so sold on the one test-one grade system being so awful, since the real world often judges people in the same way.  I'm not sure if that makes any sense, but I think it's at least a reasonable contribution to next time I'm in the "grades are random" discussion and want something else to do besides sigh and roll my eyes.

      Many apologies for the couple of skipped days and generally short posts the last few days.  Rehearsal, rehearsal, rehearsal.  Which is no excuse, I know.  This weekend will produce a motherlode of new material that will keep you laughing all week.  Trust me on this one.  And Thursday and Friday will have good stuff too.  If you're a loyal reader and have a preference between ramblings in paragraphs, sketches, or songs, shoot me an e-mail and it will motivate me to get cracking on some funny stuff.  I mean that.  Random thought as I was returning to my room today after a trip to CVS to buy a toilet plunger because the plumbing sucks and building services is slower than my digestive system is -- hard to disguise a plunger in a plastic bag.  There's simply nothing else it can be.

      Went to an information session for people who might be interested in helping to teach the First Year Lawyering program next year... it's an organization called the Board of Student Advisors.  The meeting wasn't funny enough to give me anything funny to write.  Unfortunately.  In other news, the show I'm in opens next week.  From the e-mail I sent to my section:  Some questions and answers about what the Parody is and why you should come see it.  "What's the parody?" It's a musical poking fun at law school life, some professors, and some students.  "Did you say students?" Yeah.  Quite a few students, in fact.  "Really?" Yeah.  And some not so gently either.  That makes it funnier.  Like, for example, imagine if there was a girl in our section with a tropical disease, and her name was, I don't know, Mallory Smith.  And imagine pro basketball player Yao Ming was in our section too.  There might be a scene that looks kind of like this, but funnier:  YAO-IS-HE-TALL MING: Hi there, MALARIA SMITH.  How's your tropical disease coming along?  MALARIA SMITH: My arm just fell off.  Oops.  What's it like with your head in the clouds, YAO-IS-HE-TALL MING?  YAO: A little lonely sometimes.  MALARIA: That's too bad.  By the way, my disease is contagious.  YAO: Oh.  I think I want a vaccine.  MALARIA: That sounds like a song title.  YAO: Yes, it does.  [MALARIA and YAO begin to sing a song, to the tune of the Backstreet Boys' "I Want It That Way"]  "I Want a Vaccine"  You are, infected Your arm, not connected Your skin, a bit green I want a vaccine  And so on... you get the drift.  "Am I being parodied?" You'll have to come see the show to find out.  I signed a confidentiality agreement (because, of course, this is law school...), so I can't tell you.  But hopefully I am not violating anything by saying that at least one student in our section and at least one of our professors is being parodied.  "Is the show funny?" Yeah.  "How long is it?" Let's just say you'll get your money's worth.  "Oh." No, what I mean is that it's funny.  "Can I buy tickets directly from you?" Sort of.  You can come to the Hark during one of the times when I will be serving my mandatory ticket selling duty.  "Is this e-mail going to end soon?  You're wasting my time and it's not even that funny." Sorry.  I'm done now.

      Another song... based on Torts class and our discussions of the McDonalds obesity case, where someone sued McDonalds for making her fat... to the tune of "Say You, Say Me" by Lionel Richie  (Chorus:) Sue you, sue me; sue us together Sue us every day Sue you, sue me; sue us together It's the American way  I had a lunch, I had an awesome lunch Burgers in the bun, I could eat a ton Nobody said, you should have salad instead When I finally broke the scale, sue McDonalds, I'll prevail  Sue you, sue me... (Chorus)  And all of those fries, all of those sumptious fries Extra mayo, extra salt, but I know it's not my fault They didn't say, you shouldn't eat that way So I have someone to blame For the cow that I became  (Chorus)  So you think Big Macs are good for you - Oh no And the ice cream shakes are not so good as well That's right - I'm telling you It's time to call a lawyer - Oh yes Believing who you are: Manipulated victim  (Chorus)  Sue us together... it's the American way.

      The moot court competition  Hows your moot court brief coming along? has been a pretty common refrain lately. Next to howd the grades turn out, boy, that weather, and gosh darn it, income taxes are due in less than two months.  As if first-year lawyering wasnt marginalized enough by the fact that its graded pass-fail, taught in part by fellow students, and relies on videos about the Dewey Decimal System to fill up lecture time, this semester we get to work in pairs.  Semester three of first-year lawyering, if it continued down this path, would involve making a diorama of a courtroom  complete with a toy action figure of Justice Thomas, and a thimble full of Coca-Cola with an eyelash on it (Im so close to crossing the line with that comment, I can feel it)  and writing a Haiku about Westlaw.  I search for cases / But I never win a prize / Screw these stupid points.  I dont think winning the first-year moot court competition (yeah, yeah, I know its not really a competition.  Just by writing the brief, were all winners) depends on the actual brief quality as much as it depends on a strict adherence to the byzantine rules and regulations that we have to follow.  I imagine that by the time we give our oral arguments, there are only a few briefs left even eligible for the best brief award.  All of the rest will have been disqualified for failure to turn in seventy-three copies, each bound in a unique and different way (like snowflakes), with a different color cover.  Are you sure the brief with the Mustard Yellow cover gets stapled into a Mobius strip and the one in the Burnt Sienna folder gets shot out of a cannon?  I think its the Plum cover in the Gannett House boxes with a candlestick.  You both know better than I.  I havent a Clue.  After counting the number of pixels on each page to make sure I didnt exceed the three million, seven hundred thousand, six hundred and forty-four pixel-per-page limit, I made sure that my margins measured 12 pica and I had stapled the brief on all six corners of the special hexagonal brief paper I purchased at the only moot court-approved Kinkos copy shop in the world, located just outside of Stockholm, Sweden.  My partner and I also remembered to sign each punctuation mark, as the rules indicated.  However, even given our careful attention to ensuring we had exactly twice as many consonants as vowels, and no use of the letter D, our brief was disqualified because I had accidentally overheard a conversation two librarians were having about inter-library loan.  As soon as the Ames surveillance cameras posted in the treetops and installed in each campus squirrels left eye caught wind of this conversation, we were notified by express mail with a blue letter in a green envelope with no more than seven-tenths of a gram of saliva used to lick the stamp.  But weve appealed the disqualification to the Advisory Board since the letter cited an unpublished regulation that appears on neither Lexis nor Westlaw.  After being caned for our failure to follow the rules (the additional penalty imposed by our first-year lawyering instructor, per the last sentence on the first page of the Rules Packet), my partner and I decided to give up any hope of earning our High Pass on the Ames brief itself, and instead sought to make up for any deficiencies by concentrating on the 10% of our grade devoted to class participation.  I decided to raise my hand at the beginning of class, and simply not put it down until I was called on, no matter what the question.  However, this failed to distinguish me from a number of other students, who appeared to have shoulder injuries that made it physically impossible for their hands to be in anything but the oh, please, please, please call on me! position.  My class participation strategy having failed to put me in the good graces of my lawyering instructor, I chose instead to volunteer to be a research assistant and look for new textbooks for next year, to replace Briefing for Lower Primates and All About Microfiche.  The results of my comprehensive search of the Community College Bookstore, the seventh sub-basement level of the library, and the popular website pornographiclawschooltextbooks.com, were not particularly fruitful, and all I was able to recommend were the updated versions of the two books were already using, retitled Briefing for Lower Primates, and some species of Birds, and Everything You Always Wanted To Know about Microfiche, but were afraid to ask.  But I forgot to package my recommendations in a corn husk with a dollop of sour cream, and so they were instantly disqualified.

      Sequel to yesterday's song.  Here's a parody of "Hold My Hand" by Hootie and the Blowfish.  See me sit up front, see me lift my chair up high See me start to twitch and tremor See the glimmer in my eye See me sort of smirk, just a little, hardly there The professor turns around And my hand is in the air  Oh, I got a hand for you A hand in the air for you  Yesterday, I had not read the case But I have thoughts, so you should listen Or just keep staring into space This class is mine, all mine and nothing more Let me step up onto my soapbox Captive students, hear me roar  'Cause I got a hand for you A hand in the air for you  Raise my hand, I just have to raise my hand Raise my hand, I'll tell you what I think About everything Raise my hand, everything you ought to hear Because I will be talking The most that, the most that I can  See, I was quiet, but I was in denial About how much I had to offer And how my words are so worthwhile I raised my hand, and then I screamed aloud And all the eyes were focused on me I felt big and smart and proud  Now I got a hand for you A hand always up for you  Raise my hand, I just have to raise my hand Raise my hand, hearing me talk makes me feel grand Raise my hand, maybe I can't get an A but I want to raise it, the most that... The most that I can

      He must like lunch:  From an e-mail just now, regarding a "brown-bag lunch" (means lunch in a classroom with a speaker) we're invited to as part of one of my classes... "Students - Prof. XXXXX will be inviting 2 students to join him... for another lunch after the brown-bag lunch on Friday... If more than 2 students are interested, a lottery will be held. Thanks."  It makes perfect sense, I guess, for the professor to be having lunch with the speaker after the talk.  But it just sounds funny to say "another lunch."

      One class cancelled due to the snow, but one went on as planned.  Quick story: I was going to the bathroom before class, and as I was walking in, a professor was on his way out, and there was another student on his way in right behind me.  I heard the following exchange:  STUDENT: Oh!  Professor! PROFESSOR: Yes? STUDENT: I'm so sorry I missed your class yesterday. PROFESSOR: Well, it was a very good class. STUDENT: Yes, I'm sure it was. PROFESSOR: And I hope you have a good excuse. STUDENT: Uh... PROFESSOR: I'll see you there tomorrow. STUDENT: Uh... yes.  Yes.  See you tomorrow.  I thought it was funny.  In international environmental law class today, the professor made a comment that I think would make a great slogan for the country Jordan.  "Jordan: Surviving entirely due to aid."  Yes, that'll get the tourists coming.

      Lots of snow!  Classes for tomorrow morning (until noon) have been cancelled!  It's amazing how excited I am for an hour and a half of extra sleep!  In my international environmental law class today, the professor said something about endangered dolphins.  For the remainder of the class, I imagined that the professor was actually a dolphin -- a talking dolphin!  It made class much more interesting!

      I have a bunch of friends planning to go to law school either this fall or next fall.  One of them works in a DA's office now, doing real work that lawyers do.  Which means that he'll be very well-prepared for the pass/fail writing workshop, should he come here, and might challenge for the elusive "high pass" grade that few people are able (or even trying) to achieve.  However, it's interesting to realize that the class his lawyer-like work would most help him in is our least important, most disregarded class.  They're not training us to practice law here.  Save that vocational stuff for the get-your-degree-at-home courses advertised on late-night TV.  I have a friend in physics grad school too who wanted me to mention him in my weblog.    My friend in the witness protection program, however, prefers I keep his name and identifying characteristics to myself.

      Thanks to fellow law blogger  urlLink Sua Sponte  for her grade-related "hug" in her weblog (and I should also note that her weblog is a pretty good law school-related read... so check it out!).  I want to write more about grades, because they should feel more important than the attention I've given them, but I honestly can't come up with anything to say.  Seems like most people did OK.  And the people who did better than that seem to be doing a good job of keeping it to themselves. Unless I'm not picking up on the code.  What code?  I don't know.  But at least it gives me an idea for something funny.  So here goes.  THE "TALKING ABOUT YOUR GRADES" CODE  You say... "Grades are completely random" When you mean... "Man, I screwed up those exams."  You say... "No, grades are imperfect but still valid measures of how well we've learned the material" When you mean... "I did pretty well.  Yay for me."  You say... "It's only three grades so far... not enough to really know how we're doing." When you mean... "Man, I screwed up those exams."  You say... "I should raise my hand in class more often now, since I want everyone to know how smart I am." When you mean... "I did pretty well.  Yay for me."  You say... "I think I'm really interested in working in a smaller city, for a smaller firm, for a lot less money than the big firms.  Less money is totally the key." When you mean... "Man, I screwed up those exams."  You say... "Do they even give B's?" When you mean... "I did pretty well.  Yay for me."  You say... "Do they even give B's?  Or A's?" When you mean... "Man, I screwed up those exams."  You say... "You think the Supreme Court will have a vacancy soon?" When you mean... "I did pretty well.  Yay for me."

      Working on brief for first-year-lawyering class... and not really much more to say about grades after yesterday's posts.  So I figured I'd resort to bathroom humor today, for a change of pace.  Apologies to any first-time readers... this one's a but more low-brow than where I usually aspire to go.  "World's Worst Law Careers Panel Discussion"  [Lights up on a long table where the lawyers sit, ready to start their panel discussion.]  Moderator: Good afternoon to the [she counts with her finger] seven students whove shown up today for our exciting World of Law panel.  Well be focusing on a quickly-moving field of law this afternoon  bathroom law.  Our three distinguished guests are experts in the field.  First, from Ropes Gray, third-year associate Rhonda Flush. From Milbank, hiring partner for the insurance, finance, and excretion practice group, Harry Septic.  And from Shearman and Sterling, founding partner Bob Shearman.  Shearman: Its pronounced Charmin.  Moderator:	 Oh, Im sorry.  Bob Charmin.  [students applaud.]  Moderator:	 First, Id like you each to tell us how you got involved in bathroom law, and why you think its one of the most compelling areas of law today.  Ms. Flush?  Flush: Thanks.  Let me start off with a question.  How many of you have ever gone to the bathroom?  (some hands go up, not all.)  Most of you, thats great.  So clearly, bathroom law is something that affects virtually everybodys daily lives, or at least a few times a week.  I like to tell people a story about one of my early clients.  An elderly couple walked into the office, pretty much dripping with dung.  I had been working in bathroom law for only about a week, but the receptionist knew exactly where to send them.  They came into my office, wiped themselves off, and told me this awful story about being in a department store and the wife having the urge to relieve herself.  So she went into the bathroom  he was standing outside  and something didnt seem right.  First flush, not everything went down.  So she calls him into the stall with her, and they flush again.  And  BAM!  the toilet explodes, covering them both in feces.  It was awful.  We sued the department store and the toilet manufacturer, and came away a winner.  And ever since then, this has been my passion.  Septic: My story is a lot like Rhondas  just think cows instead of people, and buckets instead of toilets.  But I want to talk more about the day-to-day of bathroom law.  Its not just the people coming into your office covered in excrement.  Although thats certainly part of it.  Its also safety issues  one of my clients had a baby sucked down the bottom of the toilet when she flushed.  We sued the manufacturer, the installer, and the city fire department for breaking the babys arm when they fished her out of the sewer.  Its not just litigation either, its also contracts  I work with construction companies that rent Port-a-Pottys.  Its amazing how complex the rules are regarding how many workers per toilet and how many rolls of toilet paper per day a company is required to provide.  I also defended 2000 Flushes in a class action suit claiming that after 1474 flushes, the product was no longer functioning properly.  It turned out that the complainants had high-capacity units.  That project was a great way to get hands-on experience in the field, as was my very first assignment when I joined the insurance, finance, and excretion practice group  figuring out how bathroom law varied across the 50 states by going to each one and taking a crap at a rest stop.  It was perhaps the best experience Ive had in all my time here at Milbank.  Shearman:	 I founded Shearman in part to capitalize on the demands for experienced bathroom law attorneys back in the 1960s.  Federal regulations regarding the diameter of toilet seats, the number of gonorrhea bacteria allowed per square inch of a public toilet, the maximum odor anyones personal excrement is permitted to have  these were all pressing, pressing issues.  Im proud that Ive been able to grow my firm into a leader in bathroom law  and the choice of 8 of the top 10 toilet manufacturers.  This means that at Shearman, even a first year associate can get his hands dirty right away.  Moderator:	 Thanks.  The panelists will now take questions from the audience.  Student 1:	 Im often constipated.  Will this make job advancement difficult?  Moderator:	 Why dont you take that one, Harry.  Septic: Not at all.  I cant speak for my colleagues firms, but at Milbank weve got people of all different bowel consistencies and volumes.  And our senior partner wears Depends.  Moderator:	 One final question before time is up?  Student 2:	 What kind of summer position would you recommend to a 1L who wants to get into bathroom law?  Flush: Id say definitely one where youll be sitting down.  [they all laugh]  Flush: No, seriously, Id say the best thing you can do is observe.  Watch people using the toilet  family members, strangers, even well-trained cats and dogs.  Notice the problems they have, keep a keen eye for the bathroom challenges people face.  Then youll be in a great position to get a job with one of us after your 2L year.  Moderator:	 Thank you to our three panelists, and to the students who were here.  Join us for some finger food and other refreshments across the hall.  [blackout]

      This week's column for the newspaper... hot off the press...  "Of Course, There's Nothing to Write About This Week"  I really wanted to write about the public interest auction mandatory volunteer meeting this week.  I had a great line planned about how when the leaders of each of the committees got up to talk about what their committees do, I started my rank-order numbering up from the bottom as each committee said things that I don't want to do.  For example, cleaning toilets.  Or, in the case of the Faculty committee, cleaning faculty's toilets.   So by the time all of the committees finished their no-longer-than-two-minutes-but-only-assuming-your-watch-had-stopped presentations, I was out of numbers and all finished ranking them.  I was also going to mention that I had an idea for a new committee - the Phone Bank committee, which would consist of students calling all of the other students to remind them that they needed to show up to the phone bank to call Alumni, Faculty, Students, Parents, Law Firms, Business Owners, Famous People, 911, 1-800-Dentist, and the Psychic Friends Network, depending on their respective committee assignments.  And, of course, for the Silent Auction committee, calling deaf people.  I was going to write about how popular the meeting was - standing-room only! - and how I was glad I wasn't forced to go to one of the overflow rooms to watch the simulcast.  I was going to write about how I'd be happy to spend my six hours of required service writing a song for next year's meeting that won't make Aretha Franklin cry.  ("F-U-N-D-I-N-G, if you do our slavery.  F-U-N-D-I-N-G, bother all the faculty.  F-U-N-D-I-N-G, clean up auction trash debris.  F-U-N-D-I-N-G, making phone calls frightens me.")  I was going to finish the column by admitting that, really, six hours isn't too much to ask in exchange for a few thousand dollars of funding.  It's almost a thousand dollars an hour, if you're eligible for work-study, and not that much less even if you aren't.  But then I realized that's about how much we pay for every hour of class.  So it's not that impressive an argument to make.  I was going to devote the entire column to talking about the public interest auction, because, to be perfectly honest, my life just isn't that exciting, and nothing else really happened this week that's of that of much interest to 1Ls.  No big, defining moments of our 1L experience.  No unifying events, nothing that happened to all of us at roughly the same time, on the same day, that immediately sparked conversation and concern.  Certainly nothing that we'd been waiting for since exams.  Oh, but then we got our grades.  There goes that whole public interest auction thing.  Who cares about the public interest auction now anyway?  I'd have to rewrite my whole column!  I'd have to write something about how the first reaction I had to opening the envelope was how thin the paper was.  Can't they afford thicker paper?  Perhaps with a watermark, or a seal, or at least a signature?  I opened the envelope, and wasn't ready to see the letters yet.  But I could read right through the back of the paper.  It messed up my whole plan.  I read it wrong first.  A "P" in Crim?  I thought I got at least an "M."  And then I turned the paper over, and after it blew away a few times and I crawled out on the window ledge to retrieve it (noticing many of my classmates out there as well, some with quite concerned looks on their faces and brief notes ending with the word "afterlife" sticking out of their pockets), I was able to finally stick a paperweight on top and really look at it.  And what did it tell me?  Not that much.  Whatever I did as far as studying last semester, I ought to do more or less of it, depending on the class, in similar and different ways.  I figured out a pattern to my grades that may also help you figure out how to make sense of yours.  If I rank order the classes by how confident I felt going into the exam, compared to how confident I felt leaving the exam, multiplied by the number of pages my outline was, divided by my seat number, raised to the [official registrar's course number] power, and then I take the logarithm base 7, and multiply by 6.02 x 10^23 (not sure what number that is exactly, but I remember it from AP Physics in high school), I end up with a very large number that has nothing at all to do with any of the letters on my sheet.  I've also made the very astute observation that there seems to be no correlation between the number of credits a class was and my grade.  I do, however, feel bad for the person down the hall from me who noticed a strong correlation between the first letter of the class name and her grade.  She's a 2L.  She took Family Law.  And Federal Litigation.  And Feminist Legal Theory.  And Food and Drug Law (she got two grades in that one... ouch).  And Quicksand Law.  That Q really messes up her transcript.

      Top Ten Registrar Mistakes Regarding 1L Grades  10. Hiring dyslexic data entry employees.  (That's a "C" in "Briminal Law," right?) 9. Using "F" as the abbreviation for "FYL Passing Grade" on the transcripts. 8. New bilingual initiative requires grades to be reported using Egyptian hieroglyphics ("I got 'man slaughtering a horse' in Property and 'big gray rock' in Torts.") 7. "Not an Official Transcript" disclaimer treated as permission to just make stuff up. 6. Registrar's four-year old son declared, "it's backwards day!" and registrar believed him. 5. Allowing Crimson Cash to be used to increase grades.  An A-plus and a piece of blue cheese pizza costs just $7.95 as a combo deal at the Hark. 4. Liberty Bell as inspiration for the Bell Curve.  Unlucky students fall into the crack. 3. "Did postage really go up from 34 cents?  Oops." 2. Putting up the "if we don't offer you 99 cent fries with your grade report, your next B-plus is absolutely free" sign. 1. "These are the grades from the students' preliminary events.  They will be averaged with the scores from the swimsuit and evening gown competitions to determine the ten finalists who will go on to compete for the crown."

      Just got my grades.  There are some things having an anonymous weblog would be better for.  This is one of them.  Regardless of how I did, I can't think of anything I can possibly write about them in a non-anonymous setting besides:  1. The paper should be thicker.  It's no fun to open the envelope and already be able to read through the back and see what it says. 2. They shouldn't do it on a Friday, because you get all weekend to digest without enough distractions. 3. They should give back model answers when you get grades, so you can at least try and make the grades all make appropriate sense, good or bad.

      The library here at Harvard is named Langdell Hall, after Christopher Columbus Langdell, the guy who apparently invented the case method of law instruction.  Reading cases.  In big casebooks.  Enough to fill up a library.  Or so the reasoning must go.  This is just background so the song makes sense:  "Langdell Reading Room" (to the tune of Margaritaville)  Started on Monday That was a fun day  Signed into Lexis and found me a case  But then I saw her I couldnt ignore her And spent all the day staring right into space  Wasting away again in Langdell Reading Room  Searching for the thesis statement to write Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  And there is  And shes a librarian  I came back on Tuesday  A gave-me-the-blues-day  Because my librarian wasnt around   She's a real beauty  A researchin cutie Finds all of the cases that need to be found   Wasting away again in Langdell Reading Room  Searching for the Supreme Court case to cite Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  And there is  And shes a librarian  I saw her on Friday Yeah, that would my day I needed her help and she came to my aid  Wearing that short skirt And I looked down her shirt I wasnt to get any work done all day 	 Wasting away again in Langdell Reading Room  And now Ive got just three hours to write Some people claim that there's a woman to blame  And there is  And shes a librarian  Some people claim that she dont even know my name... And she dont Cause shes just the librarian.

[commercial break]  "Hadas, I'm sorry, but the American people have... done something that we'll find out after this commercial."  [commercial break]  "Hadas, you're not in the top three.

      Learned about adverse possession in Property class today.  It's kind of the property equivalent of common-law marriage, I guess.  If you act like you're the owner of a piece of land for a certain number of years, and you build stuff on it, and live there, and the real owner should reasonably know you're there but doesn't do anything about it, the land becomes yours.    So, with that in mind, here's a song about an elderly couple where the wife wasn't really in love with her husband, but after so many years of living together, he's taken adverse possession of her heart.  It was never true love We've been stuck here as two You may have loved me But I didn't love you  But our life was arranged This was how it should be Now a half-cent'ry later You adversely possess me  You've taken my heart And given your own We're always together Our bond is well-known  It's exclusive, there's not Any other with me And for all of these years With continuity  At the start, was adverse I did not love you well But you said to hang in there And time, it would tell  And in this state, the law Says possession's year 10 And at that point you sued me And then  You were declared The adverse possessor of my heart I did not love you Right from the start But you met all the elements Now your title is clear You adversely possess me In my heart, right here

      I taped American Idol because I wasn't home earlier.  Isn't that pathetic?  Sat through a meeting this evening regarding the "public interest auction," which students are required to give 6 hours of work towards in order to get summer funding in the event we have a summer job that does not pay.  We were asked to rank our choice of 11 committees, 8 of which sounded remarkably similar:  (and, yes, I'm building up to a joke here...)  1. Students -- phone bank where you will call students and beg for donations to the auction 2. Firms -- phone bank where you will call law firms and beg for donations to the auction 3. Corporations -- phone bank where you will call corporations and beg for donations to the auction 4. Alumni -- phone bank where you will call alumni and beg for donations to the auction 5. Faculty -- phone bank where you will call faculty and beg for donations to the auction 6. Special Projects -- phone bank where you will call famous people and beg for donations to the auction 7. Media -- phone bank where you will call newspapers and magazines and beg for publicity for the auction 8. Silent auction -- phone bank with TDD for the hearing impaired  (yes, that was the joke I was building towards...)

      Noticed a debate between fellow law-bloggers  urlLink Waddling Thunder  and  urlLink JMB  regarding whether someone can work at a big law firm without sacrificing his or her moral beliefs.  Since I want some of the web traffic my two fellow bloggers seem to be getting out of their back-and-forth, I figured I'd offer my thoughts.  :)  My initial reaction is that defending bad people is bad.  And I don't see any real way around that -- if you go to court defending tobacco companies, I have trouble thinking you're doing good for society.  But there's the counter-argument that being entitled to representation in court, and having a justice system where even people who do bad things get a fair trial is a value that's just as important to protect as the value of not selling things that kill people.  I can understand that argument intellectually, but I don't know if that's really the motivation for why people defend companies doing bad things, and why people go to work for law firms -- I'm pretty sure it's more about the money and the prestige than about making sure we have a fair and equitable justice system.  Because if the fair and equitable justice system was really their concern, there are people more in need of representation than big companies -- like poor people, I suppose.    But I guess my more fundamental question is whether working on something bad necessarily makes you immoral and a bad person, or if it's just a job and it's okay.  The argument I don't like is that if you don't do it, someone else will.  That seems like a cop-out.  But it's possible to work somewhere and not truly be emotionally invested, and not truly care if your client wins -- you might care on an intellectual level, that you're doing competent work and won't get fired -- but not truly deep down.  I imagine more people than we'd like to believe sleepwalk through their jobs not really feeling a stake in what happens to whoever they're working for.  But does this absolve them of moral responsibility for their actions?  Or at least make them less blameworthy than people who really care?  Or is it worse to be doing stuff that's bad for society without even having a good reason, or a low moral character that can justify your actions?    I don't really have an answer there -- and I'm certain this rambling makes little sense.  But I just figured I'd post my thoughts...

      From an e-mail:  ************** The Annual VALENTINES MATCH PARTY  "Let the Naughtiness Begin"  $15 at the door with your Harvard ID  Fill out your match survey to get a list of your 10 most compatible matches at Harvard. Lists $5. Sold ONLY at the party, so don't miss out! **************  Doesn't charging money seem like a bad idea?    Think of the counter-argument:  But how else can you possibly get a list of 10 random people who happen to answer a small sample of survey questions somewhat similarly to you????????  Isn't that worth a $15 entry fee + $5 list fee + hoping that at least one of the people on your list also showed up + the chance you can actually find them in the crowd of the people + the chance that you're actually on their list too + the incredible odds that since you both like "reading," "watching movies" and "eating food" that you must be perfectly compatible in every way??????  Actually, it sounds like it would make a great parody commercial, like those Mastercard ads.  A box of chocolates... $10 A dozen roses... $30 A list of 10 people who answered some survey questions sort of like you did... Priceless.  Oh wait, no, actually it's five dollars.

      It seems as if every day, were hit with another invitation to a law firm 1L reception.  They all sound pretty much the same.  You may have heard of us from the rejection letter we sent you a month ago when you sent us your resume looking for a summer associate position.  However, wed like you to forget about that, tear our rejection letter from your dart board, and come join us for free food and drinks so that we can convince you to send us your resume again next year.  So we can reject you one more time.  Ha ha ha.    Some firms have decided that a fancy invitation in our mailboxes is the best way to woo us.  You, generic student, and all of your classmates (or non-law student friends who can pretend), are individually invited to our informal gathering where we will distribute reams of promotional material.  Others have opted for the cheaper e-mail route, following in the footsteps of the Lower Your Mortgage Rate, A Free Gift Is Waiting For You, and Enlarge Any Body Part You Want businesses in deciding that the best way to get people to do things is to send them lots of spam.  As if the seventh time we get a reminder e-mail  Weil & Gotshal reception is just 23 weeks away!  well suddenly decide that we want to attend.    I think they should combine the MIT matchmaking service (described in a post a few days ago) with the 1L law firm receptions.  Each firm could ask us a few questions about our legal interests, and what were looking for in a mate, and match us up with an associate at their firm who can simultaneously be our recruiter, and our date.  Frankly, I think theyd get a huge turnout.  Of just the kind of associates they want, actually  single ones, without a family to keep them from working 160 hours a week.  Hey, I think Ive stumbled onto something here.

      Passage taken directly from my International Environmental Law casebook, part of an excerpt from Ambassador Tommy Koh's reflections on a United Nations environmental summit:  "At 4:00 am, after eight hours in the chair, I was desperate to go to the toilet.  I also sensed that there was a lot of tension in the room.  I announced that we would recess the meeting for five minutes in order to enable me to make a discharge of a non-toxic waste.  I promised to do it in an environmentally safe and sound manner.  The delegates broke into laughter and the meeting resumed in a better mood."  File that under too much information...

      Some thoughts about nighttime activities for law students:  We received a flyer in our mailboxes about a Harvard-MIT Valentine's Day matchmaking service.  I think it's safe to assume that this endeavor was probably MIT's idea.  The ninety-eight to two male-female ratio presumably does make it pretty difficult for MIT guys to get dates.  Of course, I'm absolutely sure that's the only thing standing in their way.  I went to the website to check out the questionnaire.  And, indeed, they're looking to match people up in terms of the most important qualities that two people need to share in order to be compatible:  1. My idea of the perfect Saturday night is: (a) studying at home; (b) studying in the library; (c) studying in the student lounge; (d) recharging my graphing calculator  2. My favorite computer programming language is: (a) Java; (b) Pascal; (c) Basic; (d) the one I used to program my last girlfriend  3. My career goal is: (a) to one day be a guest on "Charlie Rose"; (b) to move to a secluded cabin in the mountains; (c) to grow a long and unkempt beard; (d) to get rid of the voices  4. My favorite movie is: (a) A Beautiful Mind; (b) All About Eigenvalues; (c) Quantum Mechanics Lecture Series Volume 5; (d) Quantum Mechanics Lecture Series Volume 4  5. My last kiss was with: (a) my mom; (b) my dog; (c) myself; (d) my roommate, but we were both drunk  6. My favorite fashion accessory is: (a) my brown glasses; (b) my green glasses; (c) my black glasses; (d) my glasses with the masking tape  I filled out my questionnaire and sent it back.  Twelve seconds later, I received an e-mail telling me that my top three most perfect matches are the woman who alphabetizes signed promissory notes in the financial aid office, the automated student organizations activity notifier (it's a real person; her first name is Jennifer), and Stephen Hawking.  However, I wasn't able to set up a date with any of them, because all of my nights are busy going to law firm receptions.  I find it ironic that some of them are held at the House of Blues.  Because what better way to describe a law firm than a "House of Blues?"  Can't get much bluer than sitting in an office all day searching Westlaw.  "Join us for cocktails and conversation."  "Cocktails first.  We need you as drunk as possible in order for us to have any chance to convince you that we're different from all of the other firms."  If I could bring myself to pass up the reception for Sleepy, Grumpy, and Doc LLP, according to another e-mail, I could attend the Jewish Law Student Association's Board Games night, featuring Taboo and Pictionary.  The card set for Taboo: The Orthodox Edition (suitable for any religion, in fact - I'm trying for an equally-offensive punchline regardless of what you believe in) has twenty-one thousand cards, with such "taboo" activities as "smiling," "conversing with members of the opposite gender," and "thinking marginally-dirty thoughts about undergarments."  And Pictionary might be a challenge as well - how exactly can we draw a picture of God?  Especially with this one lousy crayon.  But the very best way to spend our nights is at none of these activities.  It's at the cafeteria, enjoying "this afternoon's lunch at tonight's prices."  I think that should be the dinnertime slogan.  Just like the slogan for the soup should be "yesterday's side dishes, in last week's broth," the slogan for the calzones should be "last week's leftovers in last month's extra pizza dough," and the slogan for breakfast at the cafeteria should be "what on Earth are you thinking??"  MIT just sent me another e-mail.  Apparently my new "most perfect match" is Lara Croft, Tomb Raider.

      In property class today, we talked about a case where a hotel built a huge wall on the side of its property, ostensibly to block the sunlight from the hotel next door, casting a huge shadow over its pool and beach, making it a much less attractive option for tourists.  Here's the chorus for the song that would result from such a dispute:  "You Block My Light" -- Chorus  You block my light Always dark in the day Like it is at night You cast shadows on me And it isn't right But I lost the legal fight You block my light

      The World's Worst Summer Job Phone Interview  LAWYER Hello, is this Student?  STUDENT Mom?  LAWYER No.  This is Richie Rich from Rich, Rich, and Rich Associates.  We set up this phone interview for a summer job, remember?   STUDENT No.  I don't.  But that's okay.  LAWYER Is now a good time?  STUDENT Yes, it's perfect.  Let me just turn the volume down on the adult video I'm watching.  (the rest of the line originally read "...and pull up my pants" but I thought that was too graphic.)  LAWYER Yes, why don't you do that.  STUDENT What firm did you say you were with?  LAWYER Rich, Rich, and Rich Associates.  You can just call us Rich for short.  STUDENT I'm so excited about the possibility of working for your firm.  I really want to be in New York for the summer.  LAWYER Our office is in Stockholm.  STUDENT Yes, that's what I meant.  LAWYER So what made you apply to Rich Associates?  STUDENT Well, I was definitely most influenced by the fact that your firm and its contact information was in the mail merge file I downloaded.  LAWYER Oh.  STUDENT And of course the work you do.  LAWYER Like for example?  STUDENT That work you do.  On behalf of those companies.  And the litigation they're involved in.  LAWYER Could you be any more specific?  STUDENT No, I'd rather not.  LAWYER I see.  I noticed on your resume -- right next to the blood stain -- that you're very involved with the Target Shooting Club.  STUDENT Yes.  I love target shooting.  I like it even better without the targets.  LAWYER I was wondering how your interest in target shooting is related to your interest in our firm.  STUDENT Well, target shooting can hurt people, and, well, so does your firm.  LAWYER That's actually a fantastic answer.  STUDENT I know.  I used it in a previous interview and got a great reaction so I figured I'd add it to the piece of paper with all of my standard answers that I'm currently reading off of.  I can move to question 6 now, if you'd like.  About my work on the Journal of Cheese.  LAWYER I can't say I'm familiar with the latest in cheese law.  STUDENT Neither am I.  I'm only on the journal because it looks good on my resume.  In fact, that's why I do everything that's listed there.  To tell you the truth, I don't even go to class -- but listing my courses on my resume still looks pretty freaking awesome, don't you think?  Corporations?  Tax?  Bankruptcy?  It makes me look so knowledgeable!  It's wonderful!  LAWYER Yes, I noticed all of those courses.  I was wondering about references.  You didn't send me a sheet with any professors I can call.  STUDENT Yeah, I know.  I couldn't get any to agree to say good things about me.  But I'm happy to give you the phone number of my parole officer.  Just don't tell him where I am.  LAWYER I thought I'd end by telling you a little bit about the work you'd be doing as a summer associate.  STUDENT No, that's ok.  Every firm is the same.  I already know what you're going to say.  LAWYER Great!  Well, it's been a delight talking to you this afternoon.  STUDENT Yes, same here.  I look forward to hearing from you after you've made the hiring decisions.  LAWYER Yes, I'll be sure to drop a form letter in the mail twelve weeks after the summer ends.  Best of luck.  STUDENT Say hello to your wife for me.  (end)

      The a cappella singing group I'm a member of here generally rehearses in unoccupied classrooms.  In addition, student organizations often write announcements on blackboards to advertise upcoming events, so that students coming into class the next day will see them.  I had an uncontrollable urge this evening at rehearsal to replace the "Reagan week" announcement (see point 6 below) with "Grover Cleveland week."  I feel a twinge of guilt.  If I had truly been feeling creative, I wouldn't have merely stopped at changing the title, but I would have made small changes in the entire week's itinerary:  TUESDAY Hear Professor Charles Fried talk about the Cleveland legacy and how Cleveland's policies impact our world today.  WEDNESDAY Celebrate Grover Cleveland's birthday with a screening of his most beloved film, "Bedtime for Grover."  FRIDAY Join the business school and the law school for an '80s party.  Come dressed in your most stylish outfit from the '80s.  The 1880s!!  AND NEXT WEEK Receive your grades by US mail, much like they must have distributed them back in Grover Cleveland's time.  Since it's not like we have the technology to make grades available over the computer or anything newfangled like that.

      Random thoughts on a Wednesday afternoon:  1. "You are responsible for the actions of your cows" was something the professor said yesterday in Torts.  I think it would make a cool t-shirt slogan.  2. I have become addicted to "Everwood" on the WB and went so far as to download an episode I missed off of Kazaa.  3. Phone interviews for summer jobs are not so much fun.  I wish they could just issue interrogatories instead.  (For non-law-students: an interrogatory is a list of questions you provide written answers to.)  It's just very difficult to come up with reasonable-sounding answers to perfectly legitimate questions with the pressure of having to avoid silence.  In person, you can pause, and ponder, and use visual cues to see if the other person thinks you're making sense or thinks you're a lunatic.  On the phone I'm finding it's much harder.  I imagine there are surely people who are really good at these things, who have a great phone presence and sound confident and sure and can create compelling answers on the fly.  I'm not one of those people.  And what bothers me is that I think I'm a lot stronger of a candidate in reality than how I come across in a phone interview, but I don't know how to show that.  I've resorted to basically ending the interviews by begging the interviewers to call my references, because I really do think that they can make a better case for me than I can.   4. Lots of foreign students and older students in my International Environmental Law class.  (Subtitle: "The World Is Ending Soon!  Ahhh!")  It's actually interesting to hear what they have to say and how their attitudes and ideas are different from we selfish Americans.  It's also fun to hear cool accents.  5. Should McDonalds be liable for people getting fat because they eat too much fast food?  What if they're seduced by the advertisements?  What if they truly believe McDonalds food is healthy?  What if their parents make them eat it?  What if they're addicted to beef tallow?  I don't know if it's all as silly as it sounds.  6. Check this out: "Join the Harvard Law Republicans for one last "Reagan Week" event celebrating Ronald Reagan's 92nd birthday."  Reagan gets a whole week, while Thanksgiving only gets two days.  :)

      Had my first class of International Environmental Law today.  Provided a good excuse to play with Microsoft Word's autotext feature some more.  "Intl" becomes "international," "env" becomes environment, and "law" becomes "law."  That sounded funny in my head, but doesn't really work so well on paper.  The International Environmental Law class is my first class around a large table instead of in a lecture hall.  Providing no noticeable difference except that the laptop outlets are further away.  But that's ok, because I think I may forego the laptop in this class.  Wasting sheets upon sheets of paper is so much more environmentally friendly.  Tomorrow in Torts, we have a "bonus class."  The professor says they're fun.  Hopefully.  It's all a framing issue.  Tell us it's a "bonus class" and we have high hopes.  Tell us it's a "mandatory extra session" and people would probably go complain to the registrar or something.

      Ten pages of optical illusions to look at in my packet reading for the First Year Lawyering workshop.  Weird.  I think the point is to make us see that legal arguments -- like optical illusions -- can be framed in different ways, and that our job as lawyers is to fraem our legal issue in the way most favorable to our side.  So the judge sees the young lady instead of the old woman.  Actually, if the justification we get us in class tomorrow makes even half as much sense as that, I'd be surprised.  Instead, I'm expecting to hear something like, "yeah, we had you look at optical illusions because we want you to see that sometimes things aren't clear.  Like the law.  Yeah.  That's it.  See you next week."

I thought he vanished off the face of the Earth in 1988 when he ingloriously (if that's not a word, it should be!) dropped out of the Presidential race.  I don't know why I'm linking this article.  Maybe because my counter tells me I've had 5 visitors in the last hour, and I feel obligated to post something new.

      I'm going to use the excuse of the space shuttle exploding as a reason not to try and write anything funny today.  I can remember being in second grade and watching the Challenger explosion on a TV in the school auditorium.  They had gathered everyone together to watch the first teacher go up into space... and after they realized something had gone horribly wrong, they quickly got us back into our classrooms and we watched the newscasts with our teachers.  It's awful when stuff like this happens.  I was watching ABC News earlier and Peter Jennings made a comment to a guy from NASA, something along the lines of "the one good thing that might come of this is that more attention will be given to the space program."  And the NASA guy said, "this really isn't the kind of attention we want."  No kidding.

      A few phony Harvard Law School news briefs, in honor of April Fools Day tomorrow:   Saddam Hussein named new Law School dean   Harvard University president Larry Summers announced this week that Saddam Hussein has been named the next dean of Harvard Law School. Mr. Hussein, who has a wealth of executive experience, will begin his term in the fall. Summers said, we feel fortunate that Saddam was looking for a change, and that the timing of our opening with his early retirement was perfect. I look forward to working with Saddam on critical issues facing the law school, and feel he will be a tremendous asset as we explore the possibility of stockpiling weapons of mass destruction, and taking over Lesley College by force. It is rumored that Mr. Hussein just barely beat out Professor [name withheld to protect the guilty] in a faculty vote. One faculty member who wished to remain anonymous said, we just felt Professor [name withheld] was a bit too dictatorial, and thought we would be better off with someone with a bit more warmth. Mr. Hussein released a statement expressing his honor and delight at being selected for the position, promising to bring himself up to speed on all matters concerning the law school just as soon as the current project Im involved in finishes up.    Reflection Room disaster: coffee cold, cookies stale   Students held a rally outside the Harkness Commons Monday afternoon, not in protest over the war in Iraq, but in protest over the conditions of the Reflection Room, set up as a place where students could seek refuge from the turmoil in the Persian Gulf. Over thirty Reflection Room regulars carried signs, including no more cold coffee, cant you afford fresh donuts? and eating these horrible cookies is worse than flying in military helicopter and being attacked by missiles. Upstairs in the Hark, the sounds of the protestors could be heard by the few students bold enough to venture into the Reflection Room regardless of the quality of the free refreshments. Said one 2L, I think the cookies are just fine. I especially like the little gingerbread men. Although the ones whose heads are missing are a bit frightening, and only serve to remind me of the world situation. Excuse me while I cry myself to sleep. Dean Clark expressed disappointment that students would react negatively to the free coffee and donuts, meant entirely as a goodwill gesture to the law school community. Dean Clark explained: I had the idea to give out free cookies, donuts and coffee, but just needed a reason. Then I called up my good friend President Bush and he agreed to start a war for us, just so I could put my plan into action.    Harvard endowment grows 36%; slow economy blamed   Harvard Universitys 2003 tax return, released publicly this week, indicates that the endowment grew by 36% this past year to a total of 28 and a whole bunch of zeroes. The lackluster return is blamed on the slow economy. The office of financial planning released a statement apologizing for the situation, and promising a return to the usual triple-digit growth in the coming year. Said a representative, I understand that people will be disappointed that we were only able to beat every single mutual fund, bond, and international currency investment by approximately 40% in this year of troubled economic times. But I can assure you that there will be accountability for this disaster and the coming year will involve a greater-than-usual amount of strategic investment, fundraising, and currency printing in the basement of Langdell Library.    Students use break to make a difference   Last week, Harvard Law School students traveled around the world to help the economies of a number of countries over spring break, including Jamaica, Cancun, Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. Staying in some of the nicest resorts in the world, accompanied in some cases by MTV Spring Break camera crews, these students sacrificed their week off from school to help grow the economies of these struggling nations, going out of their way to buy copious amounts of liquor, eat gourmet food, and sleep until noon.

      If you're a baseball fan, you'll want to read this NY Times Magazine article about Oakland A's GM  urlLink Billy Beane .  Great article.  And, even more remarkably, yet again the NY Times Magazine has an awesome article.  Every week, without fail, there's one great, great article.  Whoever's editing the NY Times Magazine must be super-cool.  Every week, something I want to read.  I'm consistently impressed.

      Off-topic: just came across something pretty interesting on the web,  urlLink criticizing the accuracy  of Michael Moore's "Bowling for Columbine" and saying it distorted reality for the sake of making a compelling movie.  My politics are probably closer to Moore than the author of this piece regarding guns and gun control (though perhaps not in general), so I'm not linking to this to say "ooh, look, Michael Moore's wrong."  I just thought it was a really interesting and detailed discussion -- whether it's accurate or just some guy looking to attack, I don't know.  (caveat: if you didn't see "Bowling for Columbine," odds are you won't find this link particularly interesting...)

      To the tune of "A Whole New World," a fantasy about a professor actually changing someone's grade after the exam!  "A Whole New Grade"  I can look at your test This time actually read it Random grades, I concede it Makes my winter break a breeze  Did the questions make sense? I didn't actually write them Stolen from a website, them Cut and pasted them with ease  A whole new grade I've never seen this done before Actually turn the page And try to gauge The value of the answer  A whole new grade That students care, I never knew But since you seem concerned And law you've learned I think I've got a whole new grade for you  Wow, this answer's not bad Maybe if I had read it Gave you good grade instead - it Seems to spot the issues well  A whole new grade I'm gonna help your GPA You'll graduate cum laude The system's flawed Perhaps you'll clerk at where I used to be  A whole new grade You've new horizons to pursue Job offer anywhere A millionaire Make partner with this whole new grade for you  A whole new grade Erase that C If there's a way You'll have an A [and just to complete the fantasy] ...and law school's free!

      To the tune of Bryan White's "Someone Else's Star"  "Someone Else's Notes"  I'm in my room today, I did not go to class I had not done the reading, and I went to sleep too late Oh, I tried hard as I could, but I couldn't get out of bed So instead of solitaire in class, I play it in my room instead.  I guess I will be borrowing Someone else's notes I hope there's someone who showed up And did not fall asleep Why can't I be as lucky as those with no class till noon So I'm left to beg for mercy And someone else's notes  You'd think that I could find a class I'd want to go A teacher who's dynamic so the class won't seem so slow If that's too much to wish, perhaps there could be A teacher using lecture notes that are on the Web for free  I guess I will be borrowing Someone else's notes I hope there's someone who showed up And did not fall asleep Why can't I be as lucky as those with no class till noon So I'm left to beg for mercy And someone else's notes  I sit here in my room, and watch a DVD I could do that in class like lots of laptop screens I see But when I sit in class, the options ain't the same Sure I could play solitaire, but there's no sound on the game  I guess I will be borrowing Someone else's notes I hope there's someone who showed up And wrote down all the quotes Why can't I be as lucky as those with no class at all So I'm left to beg for mercy And someone else's notes

      Baseball season starts in just a few days.  I'm in five fantasy baseball leagues.  I'm addicted.  I'm in two fantasy basketball leagues that are in the playoffs now -- I'm in 2nd of 8 in one, and 5th of 12 in the other.  And I know nothing about basketball.  An advantage, perhaps, because all I go by are the numbers -- no prejudices for or against certain players, no idea how to project future performance on anything but past stats.  No idea that Caron Butler's first name isn't pronounced like "Karen" and Corey Maggette's last name not like the worm ("Maggot").  No idea what a block is, just that not too many players get them, and the ones who do are mostly Cs.  Which I think means Center, but if you told me that Centers actually stand on the Right (and Forwards stand in the Back), I'd believe you.  I know that GFs are especially valuable for their positional flexibility, and 15 rebounds is a good day.  I know that Dirk Nowitski is awfully good, but I don't know what team he plays for and if they're any good.  I know Tony Delk gets lots of 3-pointers, but I don't know a single other thing about him.  I know Michael Olowokandi has been injured for a while, but I don't know what his injury is, who replaced him, or whether his team is suffering because of it.  I just know he's good at getting blocks.  Because he's a C.  (Baseball I know much better.  So my 5 fantasy teams actually have a lot of the same people, because there's a set of players I just seem to value more than other people do, or about whom I have a hunch they'll do well.  Braden Looper, Ivan Rodriguez, Mike Sweeney, Kris Benson, Austin Kearns, Dave Roberts, Jeremy Giambi, Erubiel Durazo, Edgar Renteria, Jake Peavy, Oliver Perez, Randy Wolf, Josh Phelps, Woody Williams, Scott Williamson, Carlos Lee, and Tim Hudson seem to be my most common picks, all on at least 2 in some cases 4 of my 5 teams....)

      A quick riff on the "public interest auction" that Harvard's got -- every year, they have a big auction, and the proceeds go towards giving students summer funding if we take summer jobs that don't pay anything, or don't pay much.  I think it's like $3600 for the summer, so it's really quite a generous stipend -- although considering it's really just a small rebate on tuition more than it is actual free money, it's not really that generous.  Plus the thought that they need the money from an auction to afford to give people this summer funding when they have an endowment as big as the war cost is a little silly.  But anyway.  They solicit donations from firms, businesses, alumni, faculty and students for the auction -- and get a few hundred items, actually.  My volunteer task -- everyone who wants funding needs to "volunteer" to work 6 hours for one of the auction committees -- has been to copyedit some of the item descriptions, so I've had a chance to read them all.  A couple of faculty members are auctioning off dinner at their houses -- but I imagine it would feel awfully weird to win, and then go have dinner with the professor, and know that you're only there because you bid the most money.  I wouldn't want to force a faculty member (or anyone, really) to have dinner with me just because I bid for it.  It just sounds disturbing to me -- spending money for access to people, even if the money goes to a good place.  One professor is auctioning having him go up to your parents at graduation and tell them you were the best student he's ever had.  That feels a little wrong to me.  Even though I guess it's all in fun, sort of.  But it's only a small step from that to auctioning off good grades.  "We'll start the bidding at $1000 for an A-minus...."  And obviously that's not going to happen... but still, once we get on the slope... it bothers me a little.  Lots of students donated food -- baked goods, lasagna, etc.  Everyone's descriptions made these things sound probably much better than they really are: "world's best meat loaf," "the law school's tastiest brownies," "the best strawberry shortcake you'll ever taste."  I guess they're relying on the fact that in contracts class we learned that people can't be held liable for statements made that are obviously opinion and no one would take to be fact.  I wonder how much these things end up selling for -- on the one hand, it would be insulting to donate a cake and have it sell for a quarter... but is it really worth very much money to have someone's homemade lasagna... maybe a dollar?  What do you do with a whole cake, or a whole meat loaf anyway... it'll go bad before it's finished... and if you start giving pieces away then what's the point of having spent the money.  I guess it's the good cause stuff again....  Some people donated babysitting time -- one person wrote "World's best babysitter.  Kids love me!"  That's not very modest.  At least it's not "I love kids!  Literally!"  That was Michael Jackson's donation.  Bid for him to love your kids.  Gross, I know.  Sorry.  Lots of people donated rides to the airport.  "Ride in a stylish 1984 Honda Civic.  It's even got an AM radio!  And you can pick the station!"  Alumni donated books they'd written -- Senator Jeffords donated autographed copies.  "To Bob.  You spent way more than cover price for this book.  Stupid.  Best wishes, Jim Jeffords."  Restaurants donated gift certificates.  Law firms donated trips.  BarBri donated discount coupons for its courses -- which is kind of self-serving.  Actually, that reminds me of something else.  Yesterday, someone was telling me that most of the bar review courses are actually done on videotape.  You take the course the summer after you graduate, before you take the bar, and it meets every day for 6 weeks, for 4 hours a day.  And costs like $2500 (although if you're working for a firm, usually they pay).  And apparently there's no teacher -- they just set up a TV in the room and you watch a video lecture and take notes.  I'm not kidding.  Hearing this -- and I'm just going on one person telling me, I haven't verified it anywhere -- boggles my mind.  $2500 for a videotape series?  And being forced to "go to class" to watch a video?  Some of them are 8am-1pm every day -- why would I wake up early in the morning and trudge to a classroom for 5 hours to watch a video?  For $2500????  If this is how it's done, there had better be a book instead.  Books are faster than hearing a lecture, and easier to deal with than a videotape.  Plus, you can study it when you want.  And it wouldn't cost $2500!  And if there isn't a quality book alternative to the videotape series, I think I ought to write one, charge $500 -- it's an 80% savings, not even including any value you might put on your time -- and make my fortune that way.  Surely there's got to be a market for it.  I can't fathom that people really stand for paying $2500 to take 6 weeks of a class-on-tape.  I still can't believe my friend wasn't kidding when he told me about this.

      Today on  urlLink Attorneys Suck , a weblog by a frustrated attorney I've become mildly addicted to, the author sums up his accomplishments for the day.  It's funny.  And sad.  But more funny than sad.  Maybe.  I had some similar days before law school, when I was working.  At least at school I know I'm building towards a degree -- so days when nothing worthwhile gets accomplished are okay, because I know I'm still there for a reason.  The frustrating thing about days in the real world when nothing gets accomplished are that it makes you start to wonder what you're doing, and why you're spending 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 hours a day in an office doing nothing, and what the meaning of life is.  I'm on spring break this week, and have been having meals with a bunch of friends the last few days.  Nobody I know seems genuinely at ease with his or her situation -- friends in the real world want to go back to school; friends in school want to go be in the real world.  It's as if too much of either one is no good.  This actually leads very nicely into some thoughts I've been meaning to try and articulate into a reasonably-coherent paragraph for the last few weeks.  So I guess I'll give it a shot and see how it comes out.  A little spring break introspection... "Why I Like Law School."  "Why I Like Law School" -- reflections and incoherent ramblings after a semester and a half that hopefully have some relevance for anyone reading this who's not sure if law school's the right next step for him or her.  First of all, law school is school.  It's not nearly as different from undergrad as I thought it would be.  The lifestyle is the same, pretty much.  Classes, homework, extracurriculars.  Lots of other students, lots of social stuff to do, flexible schedules, bad cafeteria food, exams.  It's school.  If you liked undergrad, you'll like law school.  Workload hasn't been tremendously different.  More reading, less writing.  Manageable.  If you survived undergrad, you can hack it at law school.  Classes aren't as boring as I feared.  Good professors are good, no matter what they're teaching.  Less good professors are less good.  But everyone's had less good professors before.  It's not that big a deal.  The hardest things about the real world were (1) having to plan my life -- knowing that if I didn't make a special effort to do things, I would get into a rut of work, eat, sleep, repeat and would be lonely, bored, and unfulfilled.  Not a problem at school.  Usually people around, and even if not, activities are all set up for student enjoyment.  Searching unnecessary.  Easy to join things and get involved.  Lonely, bored, and unfulfilled hasn't been a problem yet.  Thankfully.  (2) pointlessness.  At work, I'd ask myself why I was there, what the point was, what this was building towards.  At school these questions have easy answers.  I get a degree at the end.  No matter how useless the day-to-day could possibly feel, the degree is still something tangible that's being worked towards.  No one -- including my own brain -- can tell me I'm wasting my time.  Of course I'm not -- I'm in law school.  Regardless of whether I feel like I'm actually learning anything.  The only downsides -- this is very expensive, and in reality it's only delaying the inevitable 3 more years.  After law school, I have to go back to the real world.  This is a nice shelter, but it's not forever.  And, as the weblog linked above illustrates, being a lawyer doesn't magically solve the problems with the real world.  Still need to find a fulfilling job -- and make a fulfilling life for myself.  But even if it 3 years of shelter, what's wrong with that?  Law school is fun -- I'm involved in lots of stuff, I've met a bunch of cool people, made some friends, learned some interesting stuff, and I come out with a really marketable and valuable piece of paper telling me I'm a lawyer.  Besides the cost -- which I can earn back if I choose to go that route -- what's wrong with spending 3 years fulfilled and reasonably happy in school even if you know you're only delaying the inevitable?  After all, isn't the entirety of life just delaying the inevitable until death?  Why not make yourself as happy and fulfilled as possible?  If I learned one thing in my two years inbetween undergrad and law school -- and my job really wasn't that bad, most days, but the days when it was pretty crappy were actually really good for coming up with platitudes about the meaning of life -- it was that it's just not worth doing something that doesn't make you feel fulfilled and reasonably content and at peace with yourself.  Life is too short.  Money isn't worth it -- beyond a certain level required just to subsist and live comfortably -- when (1) you have no time to spend it, and (2) you're sad.  I feel a bit disturbed when my classmates say they'll go work for a big law firm for a few years and then they'll have a bunch of money.  Fine, but after a few years of working 16 hours a day doing something not particularly enjoyable isn't there a risk they'll have no more friends and no more interests and hobbies.  So what good is it?  We have a limited number of days to play with.  Is it worth spending them doing things that aren't making us reasonably happy?  Maybe it is, I don't know.  I don't have answers.  But I do know I feel better at law school than I did in the real world.  So I'm glad I'm here.

      Choosing between law schools?  Play  urlLink The Ranking Game , a slightly outdated application on the University of Indiana web page that lets you rank law schools based about two dozen categories that you can assign weights to.  Find fun measures -- like # library seats / student -- that put Drake University at #1 and Harvard at #164.  Or school sq. feet / student, where Thomas Cooley is #1 and Yale is #155.  Fun stuff.

      To the tune of "The Times They Are A-Changing" by Bob Dylan, a song parody about the common law...  "The Law, It Is A-Changing"  Another tough case with An activist judge While for strict constitutionalists Law won't budge But a liberal court Can be swayed by the facts And the precedent's rapidly aging And the judge sees distinctions That may not be real And the law, it is a-changing  A hundred years one way But times they have changed But regardless, all's needed Is one judge who's deranged The opinion's a muddle Of policy talk And there's no tellin' if This is stickin' Or if they will appeal And this case overturned But the law may be a-changin'.  Come senators, congressmen Don't play it cool It depends on the Congress To pass a good rule Make it airtight and solid To withstand judges wild There are activists here Hearing cases They'll be hearing the victims And swayed by the facts Oh the law, it is a-changin'.  Though students have learned it It all could be moot All the memorization Destroyed with one suit The rules and the standards Can flip in a blink The old law is Rapidly aging Let's come up with a new one They can't understand Oh the law, it is a-changing  Exam is tomorrow But Westlaw is wise The key to the course Changing before my eyes All the students who study Are studying wrong The law's different now than this morning And the right choice before Will fail cause the law  Oh the law it is a-changing  Education is quickly outdated Cause the law it is a changing...

      From  urlLink JD2B , an article from the NJ Star-Ledger,  urlLink Law school graduate who didn't disclose prostitution arrest is fit to become attorney .  The more-than-slightly-tweaked text of the article:   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- A law school graduate who failed to disclose a prostitution arrest should not be banned from practicing law, the all-male Kentucky Supreme Court ruled, after meeting with the student for a short time in their chambers.   A majority of seven justices emerged from chambers a bit dissheveled, but smiling, and lauded the graduate for having "taken appropriate steps to deal with the residue of her early life" as well as "having really nice [assets]."   After an investigation, two hearings, and an hour at the local Motel 6, the lower court's committee had found that the graduate "has not demonstrated the maturity and insight to be placed in a position of trust.  There are, however, other positions she seemed very comfortable in."   But the court said the committee concentrated too much on her past "and not enough on her [assets]."   "Any prospective member of the bar brings his or her life experiences to this profession. She simply brings more experience than most," the court wrote.

      An article in last Sunday's Boston Globe magazine about  urlLink Marketing Food Products to Children , or, "The Invention of Purple Ketchup."  Really interesting stuff.  Heinz has apparently gained incredible market share since it started making ketchup in colors besides red, and in e-z-squeeze bottles suitable for drawing pictures.  I think law school could learn from this strategy... adding fun to everyday items... imagine if our casebooks were printed with glow-in-the-dark ink.  More fun to read.  Can read even in bed, and we wouldn't have to worry about falling asleep with the lights on.  Or if professors had to wear outlandish costumes to class.  Might increase attendance.  "Federal Rules of Civil Procedure" comic books, animated "Restatement Cartoons" starring our animal friends Richard Posner Porcupine, Justice Cardozo Dodo, and Oliver Wendell Horse.  Or maybe not.  But think about it.  Wouldn't it make law school more interesting?

      Trying desperately not to cross the line between making fun of law school and making fun of war, which I'm really not trying to do, since war is a lot more real and scary and serious than law school is.  "Free Cookies"  The Dean wrote in an e-mail: "Alternatively, you may feel that you would benefit from being in a relatively quiet place without the intrusion of news media.   For this purpose, we will make available the south end of the Harkness dining room. We will have coffee and snacks (donuts, cookies) available during the day, free of charge, at times when meals are not being served."  Free coffee, cookies and donuts?  Good intentions, and not that I'm against free food, but what does it have to do with the war?  And, if the Hark is actually making the cookies and donuts, isn't the war punishment enough?  And wouldn't the cookies be better used as weapons - biological warfare; one cookie can kill thousands; harder than plutonium; can crack windows and teeth alike.  My first thought was that if they start out giving us cookies and donuts, will the food get better if the war gets worse?  The first sign of ground troops and we're upgraded to sandwiches.  Tanks mean turkey and cranberry sauce.  Bombing raids mean it's time for a lobster bake.  I find it hard to imagine the meeting that led to the cookies-and-donuts decision.  Were there other options on the table?  "It looks like we're about to go to war.  What should we do?  Should we suspend classes?  Have an assembly?  Simulcast CNN across campus?"  "How about cookies."  "Huh?"  "Not just cookies.  Donuts too."  "Great idea... but what will they have to drink??"  "Ooh, nice catch there, associate dean for student beverage enjoyment.  We'll give them coffee too."  "Sounds like a plan.  Now let's get back to making course selection a more complicated and drawn-out -- and less automated -- process."  My biggest question concerns the donuts.  Donuts are fried in oil.  Oil comes from the Middle East.  Are we using Iraqi oil to fry the donuts?  Is it all a secret ploy to support the opposition?  Is the oil we fry donuts in even the same thing as the oil we use to make gasoline?  This seems like such a basic question, but I really don't have any idea.  I find it hard to imagine that it's vegetable oil that we pump out of the ground, but I'd believe you if you told me it was, as long as you seemed like you knew what you were talking about.  I went to find some of the free cookies this afternoon - thinking about the war made me hungry.  But there weren't any.  The sign on the door read, "The Reflection Room" and listed its hours - 7:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m., 2:30 p.m. - 5:00 p.m."  Aside from wondering what they expect us to do late at night when we're craving a Boston Crme, I found it hard to believe that someone took the time to name the room.  "The Reflection Room?"  It sounds like that weird spot in the middle of every art museum, with a fountain, a pile of rocks, and a Yanni CD playing in the background.  This is the freaking cafeteria.  "The Reflection Room" smells like roast beef and looks out over the Gropius Complex dormitories.  What kind of deep reflection can I do while staring at salt and pepper shakers and a pile of napkins?  I know the intentions are good.  There's nothing the administration can actually do about the war - except perhaps fund it, given the size of Harvard's endowment - so anything they try and do is going to seem silly and insignificant.  Coffee and cookies and donuts don't make any sense, but at least they're trying.  Like MTV News.  I turned on MTV last night to watch Sorority Life and Fraternity Life - don't criticize me for my TV preferences, please (but do give Everwood, Monday nights on the WB, a fair chance.  It's good stuff.) - and they were pre-empted for war coverage. On MTV?  What is the audience of people who are watching MTV for news? It's not like if they want to watch news about the war, they don't have just a few other choices.  "Well, the words they were using on MSNBC were just a little too big for me to understand, so I switched to MTV News, where not only can I watch Uncle Kracker telling me all about missile defense, but I can hear President Bush's news conference with J-Lo's latest single playing in the background.  Split screen.  Baghdad on the left, Madonna on the right.  Scrolling ticker: "Turkey allows United States to use its airspace... Vanessa Carlton releases latest single... Hussein hiding in bunker... O-Town gets haircut."  I know the war is serious stuff, and I don't mean to joke about it.  It's scary, it's uncertain, our military is filled with courageous and honorable people risking their lives for a greater good.  I have unlimited respect.  We're relatively safe here in law school.  They're the ones who deserve the free cookies.

      I turned on MTV last night to watch Sorority Life and Fraternity Life -- sometimes the stupidest TV shows I just find compelling for whatever reason -- and they were pre-empted for war coverage.  On MTV?  What is the audience of people that are watching MTV for news?  It's not like if they want to watch the news they don't have just a few other choices....

      A post on another weblog,  urlLink liable , from last Friday (March 14) talks about how most law school-related message boards, books, and weblogs focus on the top national law schools and not regional schools like the midwestern university she (or he, I guess -- I haven't read enough of the weblog to know) will be attending in the fall.  I suppose my take on it is probably that there's more of an audience for materials about the schools that are more well-known nationally.  Even a non-law student might be interested in hearing about what goes on at Yale.  Probably less so about Joe's Tackle Shop and Law School.  (Actually, I'd be kind of interested in what goes on there...).  Also, a lot of the books and weblogs and discussion boards out there concern the admissions process and "getting in" -- and a lot of the more regional schools simply don't have as selective an admissions process, so there's less concern and less need to analyze and discuss it.  Plus, a regional law school only has regional appeal -- there's less of an audience automatically, just based on geography.  But, overall, I sympathize with liable's concern -- although certainly my weblog doesn't do anything to fix the problem.  I agree with  urlLink Waddling Thunder , who wonders if it could be that students at regional law schools have more work to do -- and thus less time to worry about writing a weblog -- than students at the more national schools.  I think that's quite possible.  I've been a little underwhelmed at the amount of work overall, at least compared to what books like 1L and movies like the Paper Chase made it seem like it would be.

      Following up yet again on my musings from last week on extracurricular elections -- Monday night I went to the elections for a law journal I'm on.  They elected 9 people for 7 positions -- Editor-in-Chief, 2 Executive Editors, 2 Managing Editors, a Submissions Editor, Technical Editor, Communciations Editor, and Speakers Editor.  All but two of the positions were contested, so it was quite a process of people making speeches, then answering questions, then leaving the room while people talked smack about them, then we voted, then did a runoff of the top two candidates, and then announced the winner.  Repeat.  Three and a half hours.  A few things I learned you probably shouldn't do when making an election speech:  1. Don't pick your nose. 2. Don't stick your hands in your pockets, look at the floor, and pace back and forth while talking 3. Don't say "I don't care which position I get, I just want to be on the Masthead." 4. Don't use the fact that you're up at the front of the room as an opportunity to play with the window shades, dim the lights, or take another piece of cake.  And if you do take another piece of cake, don't try to hide the fact that you're eating it while your opponent is speaking. 5. Don't answer questions with, "that's a not a very good question." 6. Don't joke about the war. 7. Don't read off notes you wrote on your hand. 8. Don't forget the name of the journal you're running for the position for. 9. Don't stand with your face pressed against the window of the closed door when you're supposed to be out in the hall not hearing what everyone says about you. And, finally... 10. Don't forget to ask for a recount.  (groan)

      Check out this column from the Harvard Law Record this week,  urlLink Wild America meets Harvard Law , which responds to a column I wrote a few weeks ago.  My column included a quick aside about the LL.M. students who tend to disproportionately use dormitory kitchens.  My line, which was, I admit, perhaps a bit insensitive -- "...Although a kitchen that wasn't all the way down the hall and filled with LL.M.s roasting wild game or painting their homemade clothing with goat blood might be a pleasant change of pace" -- clearly wasn't serious.  I wasn't actually suggesting that the LL.M.s were roasting wild game in the dorm kitchens, and didn't think anyone would mistake my column about toilets for a serious news piece.  But I'm pleased and amused that it got a response.  So feel free to check that out.

      From the law school dean's e-mail about the war:  "...you may feel that you would benefit from being in a relatively quiet place without the intrusion of news media.   For this purpose, we will make available the south end of the Harkness dining room. We will have coffee and snacks (donuts, cookies) available during the day, free of charge, at times when meals are not being served."  Free cookies?  Let the war begin?  I can't possibly be the only person who thinks this is a little odd.

      A couple of experiments:  1. If there's something you find notable about law school that I haven't written a song about,  urlLink E-mail me  and I'll try to write something and post it.  2. If there's any questions about law school you'd like me to answer in my weblog, also  urlLink E-mail me  and I'll try my best.  Just figured I'd see what would happen if I ask my readers for ideas... :)  Also... I feel sort of obligated to post something -- or at least feel something, even if I weren't going to post it -- about the impending war , but, really I really have nothing to say.  I feel bad that I have no strong feelings going through my head, especially since it seems like everyone in law school has strong feelings about everything, but what can I do...  And, finally for right now... maybe if I link to this pre-law information site called urlLink  JD2B  , they'll finally know I exist.  Usually I'm cool with just getting discovered by whoever discovers me, but pretty much all of the other law school weblogs I know of are listed on their page, but not me.  Maybe the guy in charge of it read my weblog and decided he didn't like it.  Oh well.

      Trying to get motivated to work on an optional practice exam question for Property class.  Professors should never call anything optional.  It totally eliminates all motivation to actually do it. Everything should be mandatory and graded if it's worth assigning... or so I say now.  Maybe a song will help me get motivated.  A song about procrastination.  From the musical "Annie."  Enjoy.  "Tomorrow"  The work'll get done  Tomorrow Bet your bottom dollar  That tomorrow I'll do work   Too busy until Tomorrow  Checking e-mail, watching TV reruns 'Til I sleep   When I'm stuck with a task That's dull And dreary,  I just load solitaire  And sit And play.  The work'll get done Tomorrow  Let the clock keep ticking  'Til tomorrow  Not today   Tomorrow! Tomorrow! I'll do it tomorrow!  You're always a day a way!  ...and if one song isn't enough...  "Maybe"  Maybe in an hour Or maybe in a day Something will click in my brain cells Telling me I shouldn't play Maybe when my list Of things to do grows long I'll start accomplishing something Rather than writing this song  Betcha I'll pass I'm sure I will It'll get done At some point, but still Doing it's not Really that bad Why can't I start  Then I'd be glad   So maybe now it's time, Instead of when I wake  I'll get it all done today, me Maybe.   Betcha I won't Won't even try Telling myself I know it's a lie Maybe it's hard And I should start  Maybe I should But I'm just not that smart   So maybe now this song Will get me going strong  Maybe I'll start it today, me Maybe... not.

      I synthesized some of the extra-curricular activity thoughts from earlier in the week into a nice, 700-word package:  "Everybody cool reads my weblog..."  That is just part of my campaign speech for Second Assistant Vice President of the Cool Law Students Society.   They're just one of the many organizations that have recently sent me an e-mail encouraging me to come to their next meeting and vote for the new officers - and inviting me, along with the hundreds of other students who find themselves on the mailing lists of organizations they once signed up for but have no actual involvement in, to run for office myself.  As I've been discovering, it's election season.  I sat at a table at the activities fair during admitted students weekend and was surprised to realize that I knew many of the other people in the room.  I don't think I know an unusually large number of other students, but it seemed like almost everyone sitting at a table for some organization, I knew from another organization that we both had in common.  A friend of mine tried to explain the phenomenon: "There are only a limited number of 'joiners' here, and more organizations to go around than people to participate.  So, really, every student organization consists of the same people, just with different titles."  So the President of SALSA (South Asian Law Students Association -- this is real) might be the Secretary of NALSA (Native American Law Students Association -- real too), and the Treasurer of BLSA (Black Law Students Association -- pronounced "Ball-Sa.)  But the Vice President of APALSA (Asian-Pacific American Law Students Association -- totally real) may be the Publicity Director for CLSA (Catholic Law Students Association -- "Call-Sa") and the Membership Chair of JLSA (Jewish Law Students Association -- "Jall-sa").  And that's not even considering the two height-related affinity groups at the law school, TALLSA and SMALLSA.  (Not real.  That's the joke this whole paragraph is building towards.)  I'm still considering whether or not to run for a position in any of the organizations I'm in.  It seems like we've finally passed the point where resume-building ought to be a consideration.  I expect it's very unlikely that underneath the bold "Harvard Law School" heading, the difference between getting rejected by an employer and getting a job will be whether or not someone was Recording Secretary for the Harvard Defenders.  Meaning that the traditional intuition of trying to strive for the highest position realistically possible probably shouldn't apply, and that not running for anything probably shouldn't be seen as somehow "losing a race."  As one of my professors said last semester before the final exam, the race is over.  We've all already won.  Winning an election for Deputy Social Director of the Medieval Law Studies Association (MLSA) just doesn't matter.  So we're each faced with the harder question of what we actually want to do, as opposed to having to worry about what we ought to do.  Which should be a good thing.  It lets us look at the actual tasks involved in doing a given job - say, Managing Editor of the Cafeteria Lunch Menus, who perhaps needs to come up with names for the entrees, arrange the sample plates, and pick whether the pasta ought to cost $4.95, $5.25 or $6.42 - and decide whether or not they are things we feel like we'd enjoy doing and that we'd be good at.  Kind of like the considerations we all took into account when we decided whether or not to subcite for a journal in the fall.  Right.  Because everyone loves to subcite, and that's why we all do it.  Let's face it.  We're not used to really thinking about whether we want to do something or not.  We're all overachievers; that's how we got to law school.  If the girl who sits across the aisle from you in Contracts class gets elected President of the Student Animal Legal Defense Fund, and you're just the Chairman of the Neutering Committee, you feel like you've lost.  Even if you don't really want the responsibility of manning the animal phone lines and having to listen to clients barking orders at you all day.  It's human nature.  It's hard to let what look like possible opportunities go by, even if intellectually we know it won't make a difference.  So, in conclusion, I ask you to come out to next week's meeting of the Unspecific Law Students Association (ULSA) and vote for me for Associate Coordinator.  And if you'd like to run for Lieutenant Representative, there really is still time to submit your candidate statement.

      Top Ten Lies I Think Law Students Should All Conspire To Tell Admitted Students And Scare Them Away  10. "Average age of the students here?  Seven. They're brilliant. Trust me." 9. "I get seven, eight, sometimes nine minutes of sleep a night." 8. "You think the weather's bad now?  Just wait until monsoon season in the fall." 7. "No, we're just the students they let out.  The rest of them are locked in the basement doing manual labor as punishment for putting an extra comma in a footnote." 6. "All classes are conducted in Latin.  Except on Wednesday, when they use Ancient Greek." 5. "Why don't you come sit in on Legal Writing. It's the most interesting class at the law school." 4. "The reading's not too bad.  One, maybe two casebooks a week per class." 3. "Yeah, I think there's a bathroom... somewhere... not really sure.  We've all had the required surgery already." 2. "It's a lot of fun, if you don't mind the ritual sacrifice of three students a week." 1. "Weekends?  No, we have class 7 days a week.  Seriously."

      Not only is it election season (see posts from earlier this week), it's also recruitment season for the three big upperclass activities here: Legal Aid Bureau, Board of Student Advisors, and the big one, the Harvard Law Review.  Each has its own application process, its own informational meetings / wine & cheese receptions / ice cream socials / sponsored lectures, and, most important, each has its own way of filling up 20-40 hours a week that you could otherwise enjoy.    The Legal Aid Bureau, according to the five-minute presentation they made in one of my classes, requires 20 hours a week of service from each of its members, and basically helps people who can't afford legal services.  This sounds like a great thing for people who really want some hands-on experience practicing law.  I have no interest in this.  The Board of Student Advisors helps to run the First Year Lawyering program I've talked in glowing terms about (sarcasm).  But, seriously, I think it might be cool to get some experience teaching legal writing, and be a great way to spend 20 hours a week.  Plus, they pay some money.  The application process includes an edit of a deliberately-awful legal brief, some essays, a recommendation, and an interview.  The Harvard Law Review sucks approximately 40 hours a week out of the lives of its members, and has a rigorous application process involvingchecking some footnotes and writing an article about a Supreme Court case, all in a week's time after exams in the spring.  They then use a complicated algorithm involving the scores on these two things, your grades, and some factor added if you're a woman or minority, to determine who gets to write "Harvard Law Review" on their resumes.  The resume-builder in me wants to apply, just to see if I would get in.  The sane person in me wants not to.  We'll see who wins the battle.  I have a few more months to decide.

      Torts professor asked us to write 250 words about Tort law and the issues we've been talking about in class.  Here's my thoughts:  Since the beginning of the semester, when we talked about the McDonalds coffee case, I've found myself trying to identify other situations where we instinctively blame injured parties when in fact the fault may be someone else's.  Interestingly enough, I've noticed the parallels most strongly in situations involving elements of law school life.  "Looks like you chose the wrong meal" is what people say when they notice your lunch from the Hark is practically inedible.  "Guess you picked the wrong elective" is the sympathetic response to a story about a less-than-thrilling class.  "Too bad you ended up with that career counselor," "maybe you shouldn't have gone to the health clinic if you really wanted to see an actual doctor," and "guess you should've backed up your e-mail files" are all things I've heard people say.  But, on second thought, why should we blame ourselves for the cafeteria food being lousy, our electives being uninspiring, the career counselors being hit-and-miss, the health clinic offering band-aids to fix sore throats, and ITS losing our e-mail?  Mostly, I think it's because we feel powerless to do anything about these things.  Just like an individual customer really can't act alone to make McDonalds cool its coffee - except through the Torts system, I guess - we can't act individually to improve the mediocre aspects of an institution that, in most respects, at least for me, makes me feel lucky and privileged to be here.  But still, like in the McDonalds case, the intuition is to blame ourselves, and not Harvard - and maybe that's an intuition we need to question more than we currently do.

      There's an article in this week's  urlLink Harvard Law Record  about how law students interested in the arts fell pressured to hide it.  An excerpt:  "There are almost no law school organizations devoted to the arts (the Drama Society and its delightful Parody is a rare exception). Arts groups outside Harvard Law School seldom poster here because it is a waste of paper. Law students do not have time for fluffy artsy stuff. After class we must attend events that prepare us to be the political leaders of the world. Good preparation involves gaining legal, clinical and research experience, schmoozing with VIP speakers and attending info sessions that enable us to suck as much as possible out of the resources Harvard offers....You will be surprised how many of us possess talent in music, dance, acting (not just the people in the Parody!)  but keep it secret while dutifully pursuing the political life through our legal studies."  Nonsense!  The author has it backwards!  I find it hard to believe that there's a secret underground cult of Harvard Law students who want to dance and sing but feel ashamed to admit it.  The reason why there's a dearth of artistic expression (and, actually, I would argue that really there isn't this dearth at all!) is because this is a law school, and most people here are interested in the law.  The aforementioned Parody had a cast and crew numbering approximately 60.  Add to that a half dozen a cappella singers who weren't in the Parody, a half-dozen more involved in a Gilbert and Sullivan show this past fall, an improv comedy troupe of about a dozen (although I'm not totally certain they still exist... since they rejected me in the fall, I haven't anything about them...), and a handful of musicians I'm aware of who play in University orchestras, we're probably getting close to 100.  Out of a law student body of 1800, 100 evidencing a substantial interest in artistic pursuits -- and the number is probably higher, since I'm sure there are lots of off-campus things people do I'm just not aware of -- isn't an embarassing number.  After all, the self-selection here is awfully high -- most people interested in the arts probably don't want to be lawyers.  And the idea that people feel compelled to hide their interests because of peer pressure to be focused, interest-free law students is gobbledygook, I think.  I think it goes back to the joiner / non-joiner distinction from my posts over the last few days.  The joiners are doing artistic things, without a doubt.  The non-joiners aren't doing anything.  If law school is forcing people to hide their artistic side, they're doing a great job, because I just don't see it.  And the suggestion that organizations don't poster here because it's a waste of paper?  I think it's just laziness -- the Parody sold something on the order of 1500 tickets over 5 nights, the a cappella concert I was in this past fall practically sold out... I think if we knew about more events going on across the campus, law students would go no less than any other group of students.  This article, while well-intentioned, I just think is plain wrong.

      Kind of a follow-up to my joiners / non-joiners post from yesterday.  This one's really only about the joiners.  Just in the last few days, it has become election season for all the extracurricular activities, getting things in place for next year as the second half of spring semester begins.  I've been a little disappointed at my initial reaction, which has basically been the resume-builder instinct -- the thought that the higher the position, the better it is, and trying to think about what's realistic for me to be thinking about, and what can I do to put myself in the right position to end up as a person with a nice title for my resume by my 3L year.  I was hoping I'd outgrown this instinct, or at least that I'd feel that being here all by itself was enough of a resume-builder, and that I really didn't need to add Treasurer of A Cappella Singing Group in order to impress an employer.  And, intellectually, I'm completely aware that Treasurer of A Cappella Singing Group is not -- and should not -- impress an employer.  I'll concede that Editor-In-Chief of the Harvard Law Review probably impresses most employers.  Perhaps Editor-In-Chief of any legal journal here impresses many employers.  Maybe even Managing Editor.  President of the Legal Aid Bureau.  Sure.  But I think there's a very steep slope beginning to show.  Vice President of the Prison Legal Assistance Project... maybe a line on a resume, maybe a slight bonus in the job search... maybe... Secretary of the Law School Council... probably not.  The less legal-related, I'm thinking the less it matters to anyone, and the less it makes an impression when seen next to the boldfaced Harvard Law School.  Like Publicity Chair for the Drama Society... probably not worth pursuing if the goal is resume-building.  Food Editor for the newspaper... unlikely to help someone land a job.  What I really want to feel is that the time for resume building has passed, and that anything I do, I'm doing entirely because I want to do it.  Not because I think it sounds impressive, or I feel like by not running for a position I'm somehow "losing a race."  A friend of mine is on the same legal journal as I am.  They sent out a call for people interested in running for managing editor.  They sent out a second call.  It was fairly clear that they weren't overrun with candidates.  My friend said he was interested.  3 candidates, 3 positions, no elections, he;s now managing editor.  And great for him.  And, in my heart of hearts, I don't want to be managing editor of a legal journal.  I don't really have a burning desire to do the work it would entail, and I'm probably never going to be looking for a job in the field that the journal covers, so it won't ever matter that I don't have the title.  But I'd be lying if I didn't admit that it worries me a little bit.  He has a title now, and I don't.  I'm losing the race.  I had trouble falling asleep last night, lying in bed wondering where I can get a title of my own -- from which of the organizations I'm involved in can I make a compelling case for deserving a given position -- or capitalize on the disinterest of my classmates.  That's not how I want to feel, and that's not wat I want to be lying in bed thinking about.  But it's the "joiner" mentality, and the kind of stuff lots of people have been trained to feel.  I'm okay with just being a "singer" in the a cappella singing group.  The duties that the President has -- scheduling rehearsals, arranging performances, keeping track of the keyboard -- are not thrilling duties.  It's not a resume builder.  So why am I forced to admit to myself that if another 1L gets it (if a 2L gets it, awesome for them) -- that if another 1L gets it, I'll feel a little disappointed.  Whether or not I even run.  It's not that I would deserve it any more than someone else.  I really don't think I do.  (Although I don't know that I deserve it any less.  But that ain't no good reason.)  And it's not that I think other people don't deserve it, or wouldn't do a good job.  And it's not that I have any reason for wanting the job other than it's out there and attainable.  I don't need it.  Yet I have that sense inside that I'd like it.  And that it can't hurt.  Is this just the "joiner" urge?  The "achievement" urge?  It's a mystery to me...

      A bunch of law school weblogs, including  urlLink Waddling Thunder  have been posting about their legal writing classes.  One of them,  urlLink Jewish Buddha  mentions my weblog and wonders if the First Year Lawyering (FYL) class I talk about is our legal writing class (it is), and whether our mandatory moot court competition is part of it (it is).  Just to hopefully steal some of their traffic, I figure I'll add my thoughts to the discussion, more generally about the class than about the moot court competition I wrote about two weeks ago -- February 22, if you want to scroll down and read it.    The biggest flaw of the FYL program is that it's graded pass-fail (with a "high pass" grade that is apparently given to a few people per 80 person section, and a "low pass" grade hardly given at all).  Nobody fails, nobody really gets a "low pass," and the bar for getting a Pass is set pretty low.  Not that I'm saying that the only thing that drives people to do their work is the grade, but it doesn't hurt as motivation.  There simply doesn't seem to be a reason -- beyond the desire to become a better legal memo-writer (but, arguably, the memo-writing method we're taught isn't necessarily a wonderful method -- more important than figuring out whether or not it's a good method is that in many students' minds it isn't, so there's no motivation to try and perfect our understanding of it -- to put in tremendous effort, especially for students who don't necessarily expect to have to write legal briefs and memos in their chosen future careers.  Because the class is pass-fail, it feels like an inferior, less important class.  Because it's taught in part by an upperclass student (competent as she may be... and in my case, she really is terrific... she's still just a student), and in part by a "lecturer on law" as opposed to professor, it doesn't feel as vital as Contracts or Civil Procedure.  Also, the hand-holding nature of the class -- we write first drafts of all of the assignments, receive feedback, meet with the instructor to talk about it, and then write our final, graded drafts -- makes it seem, perhaps unfairly, like we're in baby school.  None of this is to say that I try less hard to do a good job here than for my other classes -- and I honestly don't believe that there are too many people who do put in less effort than they otherwise would -- but the problem is that it makes me feel stupid when I do put work into it.  I feel like I'm wasting time fixing marginally important "mistakes" in my first draft, that I'm wasting time trying to manipulate my writing into the rigid memo structure we need to follow, that I'm wasting time double-checking my footnote styles, that I'm wasting time doing some extra research to find one more relevant case -- skills that I know I have, and have demonstrated in what I've written, but just need to do the busy-work to make sure it's all nice and polished -- just to lift my grade from a Pass... to a Pass.    So, disregarding whether or not the curriculum is solid or not (I don't know enough about legal writing to have any clue, so I can't even speculate as to whether the memo format we learn is useful or garbage), I think the best thing they could do to make people less resentful of the time they put into the assignments, and respect the class more, is to give people real grades and have professors teach it.  Or call the lecturers "adjunct professors," "class B professors," or anything with the word professor in it, just so it seems like just another class and doesn't get called out as being a waste of time.

      Some thoughts on law school extra-curricular activities... I volunteered yesterday to help out with the admitted students weekend activities fair for the a cappella singing group I'm in.  I sat at our table for an hour or so, giving out copies of our fall show program to any interested students, and answering any questions people had.  But mostly just enjoying the free cookies, pretzels, popcorn, and Nantucket Nectar drinks they had.  Admitted students get treated well before they send their deposits.  We got a total of 4 interested students to sign up for our non-existent mailing list.  Including an unfortunate girl whose first name rhymed with her last name.  But what I foudn most interesting was that probably 15 out of the 50 or so students manning tables were people who'd been in the Parody show.  Out of 1800 students in the law school, the odds that 15 of 50 would be from among the 50 people in the Parody show are probably pretty steep.  (A probability shareware program I just located on the web and downloaded -- look at how dedicated I am -- tells me the odds are 4.04 x 10^(-12) of 15 or more out of 50 students manning tables would be from the Parody cast of 50 out of 1800 students.  So, yes, the odds are pretty steep.  Apologies if I screwed up the calculation somewhere.)  The explanation is that of course it's not random chance -- the people who did the Parody show were people who were willing to rehearse four hours a night for a month.  There may not be a tremendous set of people here who are willing and interested in doing that, at the potential expense of staying on top of their schoolwork.  And, by and large, people heavily involved in other organizations -- to enough of an extent that they'd be sitting a recruiting table for it -- are also people from this subgroup of law students willing to put time into extracurricular activities.  Because these "joiners" are limited in number, and because many have more than one interest they're eager to pursue, there's lots of repetition.  One of my friends manning a table yesterday agreed with this distinction of joiners vs. non-joiners.  He's a 2L, and laughed when I said I was surprised to see so many familiar faces.  "What you haven't realized yet," he said, "is that every organization here is the same group of people, just with different positions."  Perhaps that's not completely the case, but it many be closer than intuition places it.  After all, there were Parody cast members at tables for the newspaper, the Latin-American students organization, the Big Brother-Big Sister group, and lots of others.    So, the point I'm trying to make... law school has "joiners" and "non-joiners."  I think it would be interesting to see a study done comparing overall happiness, grades, and future success among the two groups (with the distinction between the two groups being, say, involvement in a substantive way (having a position with a title) in at least one activity and involvement in some way with at least one additional activity as the definition for a "joiner").  My hunch would be that joiners would be substantially happier, and peraps even have better grades -- in part because happy, busy, fulfilled people probably do better, and in part because people who are able to balance schoolwork with some extracurricular activities might just be better and quicker at the academic stuff.  I wonder if people at other schools feel this same "joiner" / "non-joiner" distinction as sharply as I've noticed it here...

      Perhaps the coolest thing I've ever witnessed... last night, before our final performance of the Parody show, someone proposed to someone else in the show.  It was really super-awesome to see.  The show went well.  Regular blogging will resume in force, now that I have six extra hours a day to work with, instead of this day-skipping nonsense of late.

      The best thing about being in the law school's parody show, without a doubt, has been getting to see the Dean putting on stage makeup while wearing an ape suit.  I think a video of that alone - the Dean of Harvard Law School in an ape suit putting on lipstick - sent to all of the admitted students - would lead to the highest enrollment yield ever.  I think it would somehow humanize the institution in a way that a tour of the library can't.    Instead, the admitted students this weekend will be treated to a weekend of well-choreographed and carefully-managed activities and events designed to demonstrate that our library has books, our courses are taught by professors, and our financial aid office needs your tax returns.  Inspiring stuff.  I took a peek at the schedule:  SUNDAY  9:00 AM: Admitted students line up outside of Health Services for a lice check.  10:00 AM: Career services panel: "How to start looking for a job before you even start law school.  First of a twelve-part series."  Also available on audiotapes for the car ride home.  11:00 AM: Financial aid lecture: "We know where you're hiding that inheritance."  11:00 AM: "I'm Not On Financial Aid" lecture: "Tips on tolerating classmates without trust funds."  12:00 PM: Lunch, provided by anywhere but the cafeteria.  Be careful of the cafeteria employees, who will be lining up to get their first taste of edible food all semester.  1:00 PM: Bar-Bri recruitment rally.  Lock in the low price now, before it goes up.  2:00 PM: Yearbook order form collection.  Lock in the low price now, before it goes up.  3:00 PM: Panel discussion: "Training for the Law Review Competition, a year in advance."  4:30 PM: Guided tour of a typical dorm room.  (Please reserve in advance, due to space constraints.)  4:31 PM: Lecture: "The History of Harvard Law School's Admitted Students Weekend."  Sponsored by the committee on self-important events.  5:00 PM: Sample 1L class and spider solitaire tutorial.  6:00 PM: Introduction to the pro bono requirement.  Attendance counts towards fulfilling the 40-hour requirement.  Attendance for all 40 hours of the meeting fulfills all pro bono requirements.  7:00 PM: "Picnic under the slush."  8:00 PM: Movie night.  Choose from: "Soul Man," "How High," or "Stealing Harvard."   9:00 PM: "Legacy Party," presented by the Student Activities Council.  10:00 PM: "I'm Choosing Yale Instead Party," presented by U.S. News and World Report.  MONDAY  12:00 AM: Sale of used books begins at the bookstore.  12:05 AM: All used books are now sold out.  3:00 AM: Random construction and/or snow plow collision outside the window of wherever you are sleeping.  Sponsored by facilities management.  7:00 AM: Deadline for nominations for "Admitted Student Section Representative."  8:00 AM: Breakfast reception, Wilkie Farr law firm, "It's never too early to start recruiting you."  9:00 AM: Subciting competition, Library.  10:00 AM: The price of a Bar-Bri review course has already risen by $10 since yesterday.  Haven't you signed up yet?  11:00 AM: Lexis-Nexis raffle for 3500 Lexis points.  12:00 PM: Lexis-Nexis lecture: "Making the Most out of your Lexis points... and why you shouldn't use Westlaw."  1:00 PM: Concluding remarks (and introductory 1L elective information session), Registrar's office.  2:00 PM: Your car has been towed.  You can't leave.  3:00 PM: No, really. You're stuck.  In all seriousness, after a semester and a half of law school, I have two pieces of advice for admitted students, to help them make their decision:  1. Don't believe any advice that starts with the word "everybody."  The stereotypes just don't hold true.  There are all kinds of people here, who do all kinds of things.  That's part of what makes it interesting.  2. You'd better like snow.

      Just got my housing lottery number for next year.  I'm on the wait list.  Which means I'm not guaranteed housing, not even in the Gropius Complex, Harvard Law School's answer to the high demand for rooms that while they are the size of bathrooms don't actually include bathrooms.    So, basically this post is to say that if you're a Harvard student reading my weblog, and will have a vacancy in an apartment next year, and want to hear draft versions of all of my weblog posts before I even post them... then please do shoot me an e-mail.  :)   (...and what's the deal with the Gropius Complex anyway?  There's nothing Complex about it...)

      I'm in the law school's parody show, which starts tomorrow.  It has inspired me to write some song parodies geared more towards performing on stage on general than to law school... but I hope you enjoy anyway...  To the tune of Billy Joel's "Piano Man"  It's halfway through One more endless scene The dialogue's dragging along Yet there's one quick fix in the bag of tricks Let's just all sing a meaningless song  The actor here On the left of me Was clearly not cast for his voice But he wanted a song, though the notes will sound wrong He's the last one left, so we've no choice  Sing us a song, you're the soloist For this number that's just filling space We know that you've come for a musical Here's some music that's in the wrong place  Now the techie backstage had my microphone But she got the clip caught on a light Now I'm screaming as loud as my voice can get But I know you can't hear me tonight  I said techie, I need a replacement mike Ought there be something extra around She said I just do props, and some costuming I don't know what to do about sound  Sing us a song, you're the soloist For this number that's really a waste We know that you've come for a musical And we know this scene should be replaced  Now sometimes a cast isn't big enough But clearly that's not what's wrong here So to give us a chance to let everyone dance There'll be three songs you wished disappear  There are characters we need to parody But when scenes start to build up too long There is only one way that the crowd's gonna stay And that's just if we give them a song  So sing us a song, you're the soloist For this song where the singers won't blend We know that you've come for a musical But I bet you thought soon it would end  Oh, sing us a song, you're the soloist For this number that's killing the band We'll be done in a moment, but humor us With some laughter, and clapping your hand  Sing us a song, you're the soloist One more chorus and then we'll move on To the next random tune we wrote this afternoon But by then all the crowd will be gone...   [to the tune of REM's "Losing My Religion"]   "Leaving my Rehearsal"   Oh, Lord, it's later  It's later than they  Said I'd be here  The times rehearsal goes to  To run this scene once more  Oh no we screwed it up  We start again   That's me in the doorway  That's me out the window  Leaving my rehearsal  Trying to sneak out the door  But I don't know if I can do it  Oh no the dance was wrong  We'll run it six more times  I thought this was till 11  I thought we would start at 8  I think I thought that I'd get fed   Every evening  Every waking hour  I'm leaving for rehearsal  Trying to read in times between  But the band is loud and lights dark  Oh no I missed my line  We start again   Consider this, consider this  The payback for our sins  Consider this  A dream, a nightmare of a dream  Stuck here  What if these notes we get, he'll  Just change his mind  We've been here  Too long  I thought this was till 11  I thought we would start at 8  I think I thought that I'd get fed   And who said run the scene  Once, twice, thrice, why? Who said run the scene, run the scene, run the scene, scene   To the tune of "Smells Like Teen Spirit"  They hung the lights Built the set The microphones Are on the stage   From cue to cue What's the line? This light is wrong Redo design   How long, how long, how long we'll go How long, how long, how long   Listen to the techies screaming Actors on stage, are daydreaming Broken spotlight, won't stop beaming Burning speakers, could be steaming Oh the light tower, please don't climb now Run the last line, one more time now Yeah!  Hey!  Hey!   I broke the leg, off a chair I lost a prop but I don't care Unscrewed a bolt, what the hell I laughed when all the towers fell   How long, how long, how long we'll go How long, how long, how long   Listen to the techies screaming Actors on stage, are daydreaming Broken spotlight, won't stop beaming Burning speakers, could be steaming Oh the light tower, please don't climb now Run the last line, one more time now Yeah!  Hey!  Hey!   And I forget, what's my cue I should have brought some work to do You think they'll care I broke the stage You think we'll ever turn the page?   How long, how long, how long we'll go How long, how long, how long   Listen to the techies screaming Actors on stage, are daydreaming Broken spotlight, won't stop beaming Burning speakers, could be steaming Oh the light tower, please don't climb now Run the last line, one more time now It's a spotlight Broken spotlight Shining spotlight Falling spotlight One less spotlight...

      "Toilet Humor"  Like most people, it seems, I have my own personal system for keeping track of things I have to do - class assignments, appointments, strangers' credit card, social security, and PIN numbers....  For me, I find post-it notes work the best.  Not only are they just the right size for listing a day's worth of things to do (or briefing a case...), but they also tend to stay where I put them.  On my desk, on my bathroom mirror, inside my shoes, on the back of my neck....  This weekend's list includes the exciting task of filling out the dormitory housing renewal application.  It just seems so much easier to live in the dorms than to worry about furniture, Internet, electricity bills, more than a hundred square feet of space, privacy, pleasant architecture....  Although a kitchen that wasn't all the way down the hall and filled with LLMs roasting wild game or painting their homemade clothing with goat blood might be a pleasant change of pace.  Overall, I guess living in the dorms here has been mostly as I expected.  No real surprises.  Besides, perhaps, the plumbing.  As soon as the weather got cold, for whatever reason, my toilet decided it no longer enjoyed the flushing process.  I deposited nothing extraordinary into the toilet, yet it began to consistently fail to fully power the journey from bowl to wherever the pipes take my little friends.  I called facilities management the first time, and they came a few hours later to fix the problem.  A week later, I had to call again.  This time it took them a day and a half.  But my bladder is strong.  The maintenance worker laughed when I asked him if maybe there's a bigger problem than what it seemed, since I'd needed to call twice in the span of just over a week.  He said twice was nothing, and that someone upstairs from me had called the past four nights in a row.  Well, at least he's regular.  And apparently eating his fiber.  And other people's fiber, too.  Three weeks later, when it happened again, it took them three days to come fix the problem.  Again, my bladder is strong, so there were no consequential damages.  But still, three days is a long time to wait when the cafeteria serves "Prune chicken in a bean sauce," and "Metamucil pizza."  Finally, this past week, I decided it was time to take matters into my own hands.  Not literally, of course.  I went to CVS in search of a plunger.  And found a selection of two.  The regular, traditional wooden plunger with the rubber suction cup, and the Plunge-O-Matic 3000, a battery-operated device complete with sound effects and splash guards.  Well, not really.  But there was a little plastic one for a dollar cheaper than the wooden one.  But I'm not sure if it was designed for real toilets or if it was part of the Barbie bathroom set.  Miniature plunger, toilet brush, and shot of mouthwash, in a kit with ultra-small Q-tips, a fingernail-sized bar of soap, and condoms for Ken.  I'll let you insert your own joke here.  When I was walking back from CVS, I passed a friend who, while we've had some fascinating conversations about the weather, I wasn't really prepared to discuss my bathroom habits with.  Yet I quickly discovered that it's very hard to disguise a plunger in a plastic bag and make it out to be something else.  "What have you got there?" he asked.  "Oh, nothing...," I said, as I put the bag behind my back.  "It's just a stickball bat."  "With a suction cup on the end?"  "Yeah, suction stickball.  It's a new game.  It's lots of fun.  There's an intramural league.  We're going down to UVA to play in a tournament."  "Sounds like fun.  You play... in the bathroom, right?"  He'd seen right through my story.  There was no hiding the plunger from his observant eyes.  After I politely excused myself from the conversation - "I really have to go to the bathroom" works as a highly believable excuse when you're carrying a plunger down the street - I kept on walking.  And passed by a professor, the girl I have a crush on, the woman who'd interviewed me earlier in the day at career services for a job with her law firm, and, oddly enough, the maintenance worker who'd come to fix my toilet the previous time.  He looked at me, and at the plunger, and I could see his heart sink.  He felt betrayed.  Double-crossed.  Disappointed that I would turn elsewhere for relief.  My neighbor saw me carrying the plunger as I got back to my room.  Word spreads like wildfire.  I'm charging by the use now.

      Time to start studying for exams.  Tests on the 16th, 19th, and 21st.  Too much time that I can't really get motivated yet.  But I should.  Soon.  American Idol update: I think it's Joshua Gracin's turn to get voted off on tomorrow night's show, after a lackluster performance this evening.

      A couple of soon-to-be 1Ls recently sent me some questions via e-mail.  Thought I'd post some of the answers, slightly edited, since someone reading might find them helpful.  If anyone reading has other questions, I'm more than happy to answer ( urlLink e-mail me )... anything to distract me from my schoolwork.  :)  1. Do professors really call on people randomly?!  Professor styles differ, but all of my first-year professors have, to some extent, called on people randomly.  And it's nowhere near as bad as it sounds.  (1) It doesn't count at all in your grade -- the grade is based only on the exam, which, at least here, is graded without them knowing whose paper it is (we use code numbers), and (2) when everyone's at risk of being called on, they're too worried they'll be next and thinking of their own answers to actually listen to yours -- no one remembers "how you did," and no one cares, because even if you mess up, they'll mess up eventually too.  It's not a big deal.  That said, I had one professor who was a master of this calling-on-people stuff, and got to about 50 of us every day in an hour and a half.  And, although it sounds like torture -- and I am not a person who generally talks in class at all -- it was my favorite class because it was so intense, and time moved so quickly, it was like an event, she was so entertaining, just to watch her "manage" the room of 80 students.  Amazing.  And the less interesting classes, to me, have tended to be those that rely mostly on volunteers -- many professors do this, but will also assign a group of students to each day, as being the ones "at risk" of being called on; so when you know it's your day, you read more carefully.  I find this ends up being a somewhat less effective method of getting students to do the reading, because it encourages everyone to be less prepared when it's not their day.  So, yeah, they call on us randomly, but it's really no big deal.  By day two, it won't even be a concern.  2. How all-consuming is law school?    Personally, I find it more similar to undergrad than I expected.  There are definitely people here who do nothing but go to class, study, and perhaps do some footnote-checking for a law journal a handful of hours each semester.  There are people I see in the library every time I go (which is not that often, and at random enough times that they wouldn't always be there, unless they're always there).  But I honestly don't know what they're spending all that time doing, and I'm certain that whatever's making them devote so much time to studying is in their own heads -- they're the ones responsible for their work-life balance, and it's not the inevitable result of the workload.  On the flip side of the spectrum, there are lots of people for whom law school, like undergrad was, is a lot more than just classes and studying.  I've had three-hour lunches with classmates in the middle of the week, with nobody running off to study, I know people who leave campus almost every weekend and visit friends or significant others or go skiing or any number of other things, without their work suffering.  I do lots of extracurriculars, I hang out with friends, I do my reading, I watch TV, I don't feel stressed, and I don't feel pressed for time much.  So it's definitely possible to have a life, and not be neglecting your classwork in the process.  3. Do law students love learning the law, or are they just there to get a job?  I may be the wrong person to answer this question, since there are lots of people who "love the law" more than me.  That said, there's no doubt that classes are generally interesting, some more so than others, but they're not bad.  And there are lots of students who get really into this stuff, and are really invested in the material and invested in the class discussion.  A good amount of people here are excited and invigorated and motivated by what we're learning, and talk about it outside of class, and talk about it with our professors, and get a lot out of it, and are not just passing time to get the degree. In fact, I don't know anyone who genuinely dislikes it, and isn't at least interested -- if not completely personally invested -- in what we're learning.  I go to class every day.  Most people do.  I do the reading.  Most people do.  I'm learning stuff.  Most people are.  If you're worried that people treat this as a necessary evil on the way to their comfortable law firm jobs, that's not what I've seen here.  That said, second and third year may be different, once many people have job offers and are looking past law school toward their careers ahead, as opposed to first year.  Although I hope that's not the case.  4. Are faculty accessible?  I've actually been pleasantly surprised at how accessible the faculty have been.  They all seem to have been ordered by the administration to take the 1Ls out to lunch in small groups -- so that's been nice, getting a meal with each professor at some point in the semester, in a group of 6 (some of them even paid).  And they have office hours, and they're eager to talk to students.  Personally, I'm not very aggressive, and I really don't seek out the professors like some students do -- going up to them after class with questions, asking them if they need research assistants, etc.  But some people do.  The professors are eager to get to know students.  Of all the concerns you might have about law school, this really should not be one of them.  5. Is law school super-competitive?  Everyone with a Harvard Law School degree will do fine, or at least that's what they keep telling us.  So there really doesn't seem to be that much overt competition.  And because the entire grade in each class is based on a final exam, graded blindly by the professor (you use a number, not your name) and often with so much room for different answers that it seems kind of hard to weigh one exam against another, a lot of people feel that their grades are somewhat arbitrary and aren't really a true reflection of anything.  I'm not sure I agree with that -- but it is hard to get too worked up when you're not really sure the questions the professor will ask will be representative of the course in the first place.  So, it's easy to rationalize that a bad grade isn't indicative of anything. Even though I think that's more of a rationalization that the complete truth.  That said, there is a mandatory 1L curve in each of our classes, centered apparently somewhere between B and B+.  Which disappointed a lot of people after we got first semester grades because they expected all As, and also made some people happy because they didn't get anything below a B-minus.  Bottom line: hasn't been ultra-competitive, and maybe in part because this is Harvard and not Joe's Law School & Tackle Shop, people are less worried, because we know we'll all do fine regardless.  6. Are students connected at all to the world at large?  I think this depends a lot on the student.  There are people here who never leave Cambridge, and probably rarely leave the law school campus.  There are also people here who are almost like commuter students, and go to class but live complete lives outside of the law school.  Because Boston is just a 20-minute subway ride away, there are options -- you're not trapped here, unless you want to be.  But lots of people want to be.    The school provides ways to be connected to the outside world in an academic setting too -- there are clinical courses that allow people to work with real clients and get hands-on experience as a lawyer, there are student organizations like the Legal Aid Bureau that do the same, there are organized social outings in Boston, I know people who do things completely unrelated to school... there's definitely a way to be connected to the world at large.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  responds to my response to his response to my post about LSAT prep courses being a waste of time and money.  I think we agree completely.  Only quibble I've got with his latest post is the last line, and it's more a quibble with my original post than with his post -- his post makes it seem like I think people who are scoring below 160 should in fact take a course.  I really don't.  Practice tests (real questions!  not fake test-prep-company-written ones!) are the way to go.  If you don't have the willpower to take some LSAT practice tests without an underpaid prep-course instructor forcing you too, is law school really the place for you?  And, just to clarify, I never actually taught a prep-course.  I did the training but it was too late in the cycle for me to teach a whole course before law school started last fall... but it was still interesting to go through the process and see the materials they use and strategies they teach.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  responds to my post about LSAT prep courses being a waste of time and money (you'll have to scroll down a bit).  Says he skipped a logic game and things turned out fine.  I'm a bit impressed, actually, because it probably means he got most everything else right, since he got into Harvard.  But just because there's a data point against it won't get me to give up my point so easily -- I still think it's generally unwise to rely on a strategy that involves your skipping a handful of questions, thus ensuring no points for them.  And that it's reasonable to say that strategies that encourage going into the exam planning to skip chunks of the exam are strategies generally designed not for people scoring at the higher end of the scale.  That said, if Waddling Thunder did in fact go into the exam with the intention of skipping a logic game, my question would be whether that strategy was formed after taking a bunch of practice tests and figuring out that, for him, it was the right strategy, or whether he took a prep course and blindly accepted their test-taking methods.  The former seems perfectly sensible.  The latter seems less so.  Not a real powerful or revolutionary point I'm trying to make here, just warning that if you want to score a 180, or something close, the market-leading test prep courses may not be the right way to go to help you get there.

      I have 930 Lexis points.   urlLink This other 1L blogger  has 4,050.  But she says she logs on every day.  I only log on when I have legal research to do.  650 points buys a $10 certificate to your choice of chain stores, like Barnes and Noble and Pizza Hut.  So I've done about $15 of Lexis surfing.  I only have 380 Westlaw points.  That other 1l blogger has 3,005.  I guess I don't do very much legal research.    What a stupid way to make people use your product unnecessarily.  I use these things when I have a reason to, not for free gift certificates.  Is there any good argument for giving away prizes?  I'm going to use Lexis anyway if I need to do legal research.  Nonsense.

      Happy Passover.  Heres some raisins.  I thought Id devote a few hundred words to mentioning the cafeterias ridiculous Passover provisions this week: a table with matzoh, beets, raisins, and hardboiled eggs for 29 cents an ounce.  Because if there were ever 4 ingredients you could put together to make a nourishing and delicious meal, its matzoh, beets, raisins, and hardboiled eggs.  Could they come up with nothing else thats got no bread in it?  Are raisins and beets really traditional Jewish foods?  I mean, it wasnt ham, but still.  And, even more absurd, how did they decorate the Passover table?  Wrapped in a napkin, a big loaf of challah.  Thats bread, for the unfamiliar.  Exactly what we cant eat on Passover.  But its Jewish, so its good enough.  Maybe they should have thrown a Torah on the table too.  Because thats Jewish.  And some foreskin.  Bread is absolutely the last thing that ought to be decorating the Passover table.  You would think they would have realized that when they were having trouble finding the challah at the supermarket.  One employee, at the supermarket: Okay, Ive got the beets and the raisins.  Have you found the challah yet?  Other guy: No, I dont see it anywhere.  Its not in the aisle with the matzoh and the fourteen flavors of macaroons.  Come on, its got to be here somewhere.  Look for some dude not eating pork.  Hell know.  Lets just go to the Italian bakery and get one.  Good idea.

      Town Meeting, A Summary"  I went to Dean-designate (Im borrowing that term from the law school newspaper  Im thinking theres probably something less clumsy, but for now, Im cool with it) Kagans town meeting this past Thursday, and was surprised at how few people were there.  Maybe 40.  I thought itd be packed.  It makes me wonder how few people go to all of the events Im not even a little bit interested in attending.  Lectures by marginally-famous alums, career services introduction to cufflinks workshops, Bar-Bri propaganda festivals, free salad from the animal rights folks... is it different people who go to each of these events, who fall in the narrow band of people actually interested, or is there a core group of two dozen or so  the Committee on Just Showing Up  that just attend everything?  Truth is I only went because I thought it would give me some material for this weeks column.  Not because I had any questions I was dying to ask about the curriculum, the possible move to Allston, the JAG recruiting policy, or the maltreatment of LL.M.s and S.J.D.s.  Microsoft Words spell check wants me to replace LL.M.s with llamas.  That may not be such a bad idea.   I like llamas.  Theyre friendly.  And dont raise their hands nearly as much in class as LL.M.s.  The town meeting was interesting.  Kagans pretty quick.  Not afraid to give direct and reasonable answers even to indirect and unreasonable questions.  It seemed like most people there had some sort of very narrow agenda they were hoping to promote.  With the growing number of students at the law school who are pregnant with Siamese twins, one girl didnt ask, but might have, are there any plans to include Siamese twin separation in the student health care plan, or build new seats in the classrooms to accommodate Siamese twins who come with their mothers to class and both want to plug into the Internet at the same time, but surf different sites?  One student asked why we dont ban law firms from recruiting on campus, since it disrupts the 2L fall semester pretty severely.  Kagan responded that it might create some competitive disadvantage if firms could recruit elsewhere but not here, and that students actually do in some cases want these law firm jobs, and for valid reasons.  Her answer was interrupted by a small skywriting airplane flying through Austin East classroom, writing Dean Kagans Town Meeting, sponsored by your friends at Skadden in chalk, and dropping those funky three-sided highlighters on the crowd.  If I was the one responding to that question, I might have answered that we dont ban classes, even though they disrupt the semester pretty severely.  And we dont ban exams, even though they totally mess up the holidays.  Another student asked if Kagan had any ideas for increasing school spirit, like giving away free t-shirts to 1Ls.  I like that idea.  Who wouldnt like a free t-shirt?  It wouldnt even have to cost Harvard anything.  It could be the 1L Harvard t-shirt, courtesy of Lexis, Westlaw, Fleet Bank, and Bar-Bri, covered with lots of fun logos and a coupon for $10 off the HLS yearbook if you act now, and $20 off your bar review class if you acted ten minutes ago.  Kagan had a great response to a couple of questions that I want to steal for my own use in class.  Im not entirely familiar with that issue, she would say, but it sounds like you are, and if you write up a memo for me, Id love to take a look.  Im going to say that next time I get asked a question in Property.  Im not entirely familiar with regulatory takings, Professor, but it sounds like you are.... And, since gradings blind, what can they do?  One student asked why some professors seem to have lots of money to take students to lunch, and others never seem to have any.  At first puzzled by the question, Kagan revealed that professors have fairly flexible accounts  they can take money from their books or research assistants fund and move it to their student entertainment fund, or vice versa, so professors really can choose how to prioritize, and whether or not were worth free meals or not.  So, basically, whenever you hear that one of your classmates is doing work for your professor, it means hes basically stealing food right out of your mouth.  Damn law students.  One person wanted to know why we dont have a campus-wide bonfire and burn down the Gropius dormitory complex.  Or something like that.  Kagan said we cant because its an architectural landmark.  Thats the problem with hiring famous architects and getting them really drunk.  But she said we could perhaps gut the buildings, turn them into office space, and build some fancy dorms across the river.  How low on the totem pole would you have to be to get an office in Gropius?  Im sorry, I cant meet with both of you at once.  All three of us cant fit in my office.  Hand that to my secretary on the way out.  Shes in the room at the end of the hall, the second stall from the left.  Just knock if the latch is closed.  900 words later, Im glad I went to the town meeting.  I got to participate in Kagans thumbs up / thumbs down vote on the FYL program, got to hear whats on the minds of some fellow students, and got the opportunity to see who I should avoid if I ever have anything nice to say about the curriculum, JAG recruiting, the move to Allston, Gropius, stingy professors, and on-campus recruiting.  But now, if youll excuse me, Ive got a memo to write in favor of creating a casebook-free campus.  Dean Kagans not entirely familiar with the issue, but would love to hear my thoughts.

      A post on  urlLink another weblog  urging law students-to-be not to waste their $1000 on an LSAT prep course but instead buy some books and take some practice tests.  I couldn't agree more.  I didn't take a prep course, but I did train to teach the LSAT for one of the major test prep companies -- and finished training feeling very glad I hadn't wasted my money on a useless twelve weeks of classes.  For people scoring on the high end of the LSAT scale and get into a top school -- the course isn't even designed for you.  They advise things like skipping a logic game because you'll "surely" run out of time, or outlining each reading comprehension passgae in detail "because it's hard to remember what you read as you go along."  Um, if you need to skip a logic game or else you're gonna run out of time, maybe instead of accepting that and knocking a bunch of points off your score automatically, you should just practice more logic games.  Practice on real tests from years past, under timed conditions, check your answers -- and you should eventually start to recognize what the test-makers are going for, and the right answers should become easier and easier to see.  The prep courses are taught by a script, and not a very good script.  It's designed for people who don't have the willpower to make themselves take practice tests -- not a good sign, if you want to be a law student, actually -- and who can't learn out of a book (again, not a good sign if you want to be a law student).

      An article in the  urlLink Harvard Crimson  about Dean-designate Kagan's town meeting I wrote about yesterday.  I was talking to a few of my friends over dinner tonight and the topic of law students as extroverts or introverts came up.  I was surprised that they disagreed with my opinion that the majority of students here are extroverts.  They insisted that many people here are actually very inwardly focused -- very into themselves, their own thoughts, their own feelings -- and not into really genuinely interacting with and feeding off of the people around them, thus making them introverts.  My train of reasoning had been that many people here seem overtly outgoing, shaking people's hands, aggressively dominating conversations, trying to be the center of attention.  Which seems extroverted.  I think maybe we're all right and that somehow these law students who have these traits have co-opted the worst of extroversion and introversion into a unique and particularly irritating personality.  :)  (Of course, this doesn't apply to plenty of people here, perhaps even most.  Just something I've noticed in more people than I'd like...)

      I went to a "law school town meeting" hosted by the new Dean (Prof. Elena Kagan -- appointed a few weeks ago to take office this summer), designed to give students an opportunity to ask questions and share their views on issues facing the law school.  Lots of questions about improving the curriculum -- people want more international law and environmental law professors, more opportunities for clinical work and "experiential learning," which I guess means doing real stuff instead of sitting in the classroom, more writing, less emphasis on just having one exam at the end of the semester to determine the whole grade, a revamp of the first year writing workshop program....  Other issues discussed were the law school's possible move across the river to Allston, creating more school spirit (one student suggested that for all the money we pay in tuition we ought to at least get a free t-shirt), improving the older buildings and dormitories, and making sure students are aware of non-corporate legal careers.  Prof. Kagan's broad overriding vision seemed to be one of engagement -- how she can get the students to engage in classes and learning and the intellectual atmosphere of the law school, and how she can get faculty to engage in teaching... not a bad vision overall.  Glad I went.  Was surprising poorly attended, I thought... maybe 40 people there to hear what the new Dean has to say... I guess people aren't fully engaged quite yet....

      There's an organization on campus, the Student Animal Legal Defense Fund (SALDF) that had a veggie food fair today of some sort.  I can't help but think that that's a perfectly good waste of an acronym, when only a few letters changed and they could really have something cute going on.  Student Animal Legal Advocacy Defense veggie food fair. SALAD.  Wouldn't that work better?

      Have to rank courses for course selection next semester.  Trying to outsmart the course registration system by ranking in such a way that I take advantage of the peculiar details of the computer algorithm.  They gave us the details.  They're funny if I exaggerate a bit. So here goes:  1. Randomize students 2. Try to enroll first student in student's first choice. 3. System crash.  Start over. 4. Randomize students 5. Enroll first student in second students' first choice and second student in first student's third choice. 6. Check for time conflict.  Enroll fourth student in three classes that all meet at the same time. 7. Check year and credit limits.  Ignore them. 8. Check whether the course is full.  If so, kick out random student and replace with student who doesn't even want the class. 9. Re-randomize students 10. System crash. Start over. 11. Note that rising 3Ls have priority over all courses over sinking 3Ls and unleavened 2Ls. 12. Enroll sixth student in eigth student's ninth choice. 13. Carry the 4 to the next column and add 7. 14. Artichoke. 15. As a consoloation, place the "bumpee" next on the priority list for that course and attempt to enroll the bumpee in his or her next choice using the tests above. 16. If the course is full with no eligible bumpee, add the student to the priority list and go on to the student's next choice until the student has been enrolled in a course. 17. Re-randomize students. 18. Repeat all steps.  6 of these steps are real.  12 are not.  Can you guess which 6?

      Funny, funny, funny  urlLink ESPN column  about today's Boston Marathon.  I've never before linked to someone and called their article "funny, funny, funny," usually because (1) it makes me feel bad to think that other people can write funny too, and (2) most articles, even those that are trying to be, (a) really aren't funny, (b) certainly aren't funny, funny, and (c) can't possibly be funny, funny, funny.  I especially like where he uses the word "defecating."  That's always worth an extra funny.  Not that I really ought to compete with "funny, funny, funny" Bill Simmons of ESPN.com and Jimmy Kimmel Live (which, the one time I've seen it, was definitely not funny, funny, funny), but here's my comment about the Boston marathon:  Why are all the famous marathons -- Boston and New York are the only marathons I can think of, so that's the entirety of the "all the famous marathons" group to which I refer -- held in cold cities?  I'd much rather see a Dallas marathon, where if you do it in the winter, it's pleasant outside, and if you do it in the summer, you have the added bonus of ending the sport of competitive running because all of the runners will die of heatstroke.  Would there be a better evening news headline than "Dallas marathon ends with four thousand dead, no winner"?

      An article in the NY Times about what seems like it could possibly be the biggest threat to law student productivity since, I don't know, spider solitaire.  You'll just have to  urlLink click  to find out what I'm talking about.  There are days when I think having one of these would be cool, but then I realize that there's really nothing lacking in my life not having one, and that one would only bring more distractions to my life.  So I'm glad they're too expensive for me to really contemplate buying anyway.

      Advice We Wish We Had (most of a column to be hopefully published in next week's newspaper)  With the first year of law school coming to a close, it seems to be the perfect time to look back on the 1L experience and reflect. Eight months ago, my classmates and I arrived on campus, armed with dog-eared copies of Scott Turows One-L, resumes-in-progress with a few lines of blank space under Law School waiting to be filled in, and lots of expectations. Have our expectations been met?  I think the answers probably different for everyone.  But I think we can all agree that theres a set of things we know now that we wished someone had told us back then, on the first day of orientation.  Ive come up with a few such pearls of wisdom about the first year of law school:  Pack your sweaters: youll need them here in Boston.  And your earmuffs, gloves and hat.  And a portable space heater.  And a snow shovel.  And pajamas with feet.  And, not that its really relevant for this paragraph, but before I forget, a plunger.  Lexis is better than Westlaw.  I mean Westlaw is better than Lexis.  I mean dont bother buying any highlighters, because theyll give you more than youll ever need.  Dont buy a coffee mug, yo-yo, miniature garbage pail basketball set, bouncing light-up ball, stale tootsie roll candies, fake velvet pen case or pocket-sized Constitution either.  Theyll give those to you too.  The refrigerators not necessary.  As long as you can make a meal out of chicken on a stick, miniature spinach pies, potato puffs and tiny hot dogs, and dont mind putting on a button-down shirt and schmoozing it up with recruiters from a gaggle of interchangeable law firms, you can eat free every night.  Invest in a quality screensaver.  Sometimes you need something more exciting than the Windows logo to jar you out of the occasional mind-stupor and remind you that you havent touched the keyboard in ten minutes, while the professors been talking all this time about whats going to be on the exam.   The summer job search has already begun.  Imagine how much more relaxing the winter would have been if only wed spent all of last summer, before starting law school, looking for the next summers job.  We could have beaten everyone else by five months and come to school relaxed and undistracted, avoiding hundreds of hours of lectures, panels, forums, information sessions, advising appointments, meetings, orientations, workshops, cocktail parties and clambakes, all devoted to making sure all the bullets lined up straight on our resumes.  Subciting isnt fun. I remember going to the journals fair in the fall and thinking about how much fun looking up footnotes in the Bluebook sounded like it would be.  So I was definitely in for a shock when I realized its really not a particularly enjoyable way to spend a Saturday.  If only someone had told me.  No one will remember if you give a dumb answer when a professor calls on you.  However, if you do it twice, everyone will remember.  And laugh at you.  For a long, long time.  There are normal people here.  Somewhere.  Im sure everyone had that moment during the first week of school when they looked around and wondered why everyone seemed so strange, and where all the normal people were.  Hopefully, most people wonder about that less often by now, and not simply because all of the people wondering have now become strange.  If you can follow my logic here, clearly youre not one of the normal people Im talking about.  And, finally, you will survive.  We all have.  Except for those who havent.  But theyre surely not reading this, so they dont count.  Eight months, approximately five hundred hours of class (you mean we could have done this all in three weeks if we didnt sleep?), perhaps three hundred thousand pages of reading... and were almost there.  Were almost 2Ls.  Just some pesky exams standing in our way.

      From a post about Harvard on the Princeton Review law school message boards:  "Most students eat dinner in their rooms"  Is that really true?  I guess it could be... but am I unusual in that I feel like a complete social reject if I'm forced to eat dinner alone in my room?  I'll do anything to avoid eating dinner alone in my room.  I'll go to the cafeteria, even though for dinner it just serves the same day's lunch (not kidding!  I swear!), just because I know I'll see at least someone from my section there to eat with.  I'll wait until right before a meeting / rehearsal / activity to get dinner and take it with me over there.  I'll make up an errand to go do that'll force me to just grab something quick on the way back. A few times I've gone to the library with the express purpose of finding someone I know who hasn't eaten yet.  And I've been successful each time.  Am I unusual in that eating dinner alone bothers me?  (The implicit message here: if anyone I know is reading this and wants to grab dinner, anytime, just let me know...)

      The Student Organization Election Primer: How to become President of the Federalist Society, the Ballroom Dance Society, or anything in between.  Five steps to winning an election.  I'm trying here to straddle the line between funny and serious...  Step One. Find a large organization where lots of people are eligible to vote in elections, yet only a handful ever do anything besides show up for free food.  Journals are especially good at this stuff.  Boring activities too, that look good on a resume.  People show up, get on an e-mail list, write it on their resume, and then stop going.  Rabid political organizations of either end of the spectrum probably don't get points here.  Step Two. Find a way to stand out in some way.  Volunteer to do something terribly unenjoyable, like vacuuming the office, or organizing the minutes from past meetings, or repainting the walls.  This ensures you get comments at elections like, "She's really dedicated.  She even volunteered to mop up the urine after that unfortunate incident with the goat."  Step Three. Suck up to the person who currently has the job you want.  "Madam President, do you need someone to help you change the bandage on your wound?  I'd be happy to help.  We've got so much in common, like our two eyes, ten fingers, and love for this wonderful organization you do such a good job of heading up.  Wouldn't it be great if your legacy could continue with the next President being as dedicated as you. But not nearly as pretty, of course."  Step Four.  Drag people to elections.  Swallow your pride and beg your friends -- who should all be members of this large and relatively useless organization, even if they do nothing for it -- to come to elections and vote for you.  If they're good friends, you might even get them to say ridiculously nice things about you that, while not actually lies, could be construed as somewhat misleading.  Like, "Every time I was in the office, she was there doing work," from a friend who has never actually been to the office.  Or, "I was impressed that she never wanted any credit for that great job she did licking the paper plates clean after the banquet.  I didn't even know about it until she sent out that e-mail to the entire organization where she just happened to inadvertently mention it in bold letters."  Step Five.  Make friends with the vote counter.  There's no easier way to win an election than to make sure the vote counter's on your side and relatively unencumbered by principles of democracy.  "It's not fair that all of these people who never show up to meetings get to vote," you can say if your opponent has somehow done a better job on step four than you have.  "It's your duty as outgoing president / randomly-chose upperclassman / former aide to a member of the Senate Ethics committee to make sure the election isn't decided by people who don't care about the future of the organization.  Think about the consequences."

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  with a reaction to my thoughts about the Public Interest Auction.  He says that what disturned him most was that they called the student-helpers "volunteers" when in fact we were compelled to help if we wanted to receive public interest funding.  Fair point.  I just hadn't thought of it before.  Seems like a bunch of stuff at law school is voluntary without really being voluntary, like working for a journal (everyone does it).  Actually, that's the only other example I can think of.  I could say "ending up at a law firm," or at least "looking for a law firm job," but I might be overstating things.  I could also say "going to class," but that really is voluntary, and, judging by the attendance in some of my classes lately, not a voluntary opportunity that's taken advantage of particularly often.

       urlLink Another 1L , at the University of Chicago, posted a comment about my criticism of the public interest auction from a few days back.  (You'll have to scroll a bit on his blog -- it's his bottommost entry on the 13th)  He doesn't think buying access to professors is such a big deal:   "First, exams in all the 1L classes, and in most other large classes, are graded anonymously.... Second, professors are already so accessible here, it doesn't seem like one would need this method of access. I think the novelty of the auction isn't so much the opportunity to see professors outside of class; it's the opportunity to see them while riding a ferris wheel or tasting various scotches. Which just doesn't seem to me to be that big a deal."  And, actually, he's probably right.  It's not that big of a deal.  I don't genuinely believe that it affects grades at all.  Or that professors aren't otherwise accessible.  It's not earth-shattering, I'm not calling the ABA to take away Harvard's accreditation, but it's just gray enough that I felt compelled to write about it.  And that I felt compelled to think about it.  Does it really matter?  Not so much.  Does it make me a little uncomfortable?  Yeah.   urlLink Another 1L , late Monday night, also poses the question to fellow 1Ls, "Are you having fun? Do you like it?"  I hope it comes in my writing here that, personally, yeah, I do. Better than I ever expected.  Of course, most of that is because of extracurriculars that aren't so much related to the law (plus the T1 Internet connection... kidding?), but still, classes are sometimes cool too.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder , who, by the way, has just revealed himself to be a Harvard student, breaking his anonymity regarding which school he was at (I kept his secret well, didn't I?  Kind of figured it out when everything he was experiencing seemed to happen at his school the same exact day as it happened to me.), posted Monday about the meeting for prospective applicants to the Law Review (the Law Review has a week-long competition after school ends in the spring, and the results of that, combined with our grades and a dash a magic fairy dust, determines who gets to spend the bulk of their remaining law school hours in the library looking up footnotes).  Apparently the competition requires an average of 9-10 hours a day of work.  From what I hear, sounds kind of like what being on Law Review requires.  Talking to one of my friends on law review -- I must be a truly valued friend; he actually left the library to eat a meal with me; I'm kidding of course; Sort of -- he said I probably wouldn't have to drop all of my other activities to do law review.  Just most of them.  Nothing about law review sounds fun except the part about putting it on your resume.  And for people who strive to be Supreme Court justices -- or Supreme Court clerks, I guess, or Harvard professors -- it truly is valuable, and probably worth it.  For the rest of us, I don't know.  I think the Harvard Law School name may be enough, without Law Review there too.  My resume will survive... I hope...

      At Kinko's today (actually, I guess that would be yesterday... missed another day... by mere minutes...), making photocopies of a flyer for the a cappella concert my group has next week:  WOMAN BEHIND ME IN LINE: You getting colored paper for that? ME: Yeah WOMAN: What color were you thinking? ME: Ultra Lemon WOMAN: Yes, that's a nice color.  A litle acidic, though. ME: Oh. WOMAN: I was looking at your flyer.  I think Sun Yellow might be better.  You see, I'm a painter, and I know about colors and these things.  Sun Yellow is a very warm color.  Is your singing group co-ed? ME: Yeah. WOMAN: Yeah, Sun Yellow is a very androgynous color too.  I think you should go with Sun Yellow.  I used Sun Yellow.  The flyers look very nice.

      I've turned my thoughts about the recent public interest auction (see Thursday) into 800 words I'll probably regret.  "Going Once, Going Twice, Sold"  "Item #721. An A in Professor Tribe's Con Law class. Enjoy the guarantee of an A, without having to take the exam. Yours, if you're the highest bidder." "Item #462. Your third-year paper written by Alan Dershowitz, and guaranteed publication in the Harvard Law Review." "Item #684. Supreme Court Clerkship. Donated by Justice Anthony Kennedy."  No, these weren't actually items up for bid at last week's public interest auction. But are they really as far from reality as they ought to be? Something bothered me about access to professors - lunch, dinner, a hike in the woods - being auctioned off to the highest bidder. I think it's great that the faculty is willing and oftentimes eager to have lunch with students, and the opportunity to interact with our professors is part of what makes the law school experience worth the tuition.  But it disturbs me that additional access can be bought... if the price is right.  It's unfair to students who don't want to pay that their classmates can get something that's valuable not in the same way that a sweet potato pie, an autographed picture of the cast of "Everybody Loves Raymond" or, in the case of Lambda's donation, a brand new vibrator is.  Access to professors is part of why we're here, and creating an imbalance of access, and allowing it to be bought and sold, really does disturb me.  Many professors post on a discussion board or e-mail out to the entire class the answers to questions that students ask.  One of my professors last semester stopped office hours after classes ended and would only take questions about the exam via e-mail, with answers mailed to the entire class, precisely to make sure that access was completely equal.  Being able to pay for more begins to destroy the integrity of the professor-student relationship.  And besides, something feels dirty about having lunch with a professor - or with anyone, really - just because you've won it at an auction.  "I paid for this conversation, Professor," I could picture someone saying - or at least thinking - "and you're just not being interesting enough.  Stop with the stories about your clerkship and start talking about the Tax exam - or I want my money back."  But, you know, it's for a good cause, so maybe it's okay.  But is it really?  "Harvard Law School is having a charity auction?" someone from, say, the American Cancer Society might ask.  "That's fantastic.  Who are they donating the proceeds to?" "Uh... Harvard Law School."  "Oh."  While I have no reason not to believe that the money raised in the auction does in fact go towards giving students working in public interest this summer a stipend (or "small tuition reimbursement in exchange for actually helping people"), is it really the case that without this money, Harvard couldn't afford it?  Look at the endowment.  This is not a needy institution, desperate for the proceeds from an hour of babysitting and a tray of homemade manicotti to pay the bills.  It's in Harvard's best interest to make public interest work possible for students - for public relations, to be able to recruit a broad range of students including those who want to practice public interest and not just corporate law, to ensure continued institutional connections with public interest organizations... it's not hard to argue that the benefits exceed the costs... and I have a hard time believing that if the public interest auction proved to be a fundraising failure one year, Harvard would simply end summer public interest funding outright.  All of this energy, and all of this goodwill.  All of this money raised, and for who?  So that Harvard can save a couple hundred thousand dollars?  Then again, who's really bearing the costs?  It's the winning bidders.  In effect, the students with disposable income are subsidizing their fellow students' summers.  It's a massive wealth redistribution scheme, from rich to less rich, hampered only by the transactions costs of actually planning and holding the auction.  Why bother with the auction at all if what we're trying to do is make the students with firm jobs kick in a few hundred dollars to subsidize public interest?  Why not just impose a tax?  I think I'm kidding, but I'm really not sure.  I hate to criticize something that, at first glance, sounds like a great idea.  And I know it's well-intentioned.  But all of this energy spent on transferring wealth, helping save Harvard some money, and bastardizing the professor-student relationship makes me a little queasy.  But, of course, it's nothing that a strawberry cream cheese pie, homemade pierogi, a Westlaw gift basket and a Soviet navy hat pin won't cure....  And, please, don't get me started on the ethics of serving free beer right before people go to bid....

All about high-level executives who can't find jobs after being laid off.  Scary stuff.  Almost makes me want to go work for a law firm, just so I have some protection against ever ending up in this situation.  Almost.  But not quite.

      I think Monday April 7th's post on  urlLink Janeway Speaks , another weblog of a 1L somewhere, illustrates some point I was making a few weeks ago.  She writes about having been in law school for two semesters and just now joining her first non-law-related activity. And that even though her classmates think that's weird, she thinks it's okay.   Well, of course it's okay!  I can't for the life of me figure out why it's such a big deal.  Why people think it's odd for a law student to be involved in activities that may not be directly related to the law.  We're smart people, we have other interests.  Yet, on this campus, I know lots of people who don't do very much at all outside of class.  I heard one person comment, upon seeing someone else putting up flyers for some event or another, "what are all these activities people do where they have to put up flyers?  I don't do anything."  So do something.  Nobody's stopping you.  I don't know what my point is other than to say that people not taking advantage of the multitude of activities there are to do are only decreasing the competition for the rest of us and robbing themselves of something to do besides watch TV and read casebooks.

      This evening is the annual public interest auction here at Harvard.  See, the school provides a stipend ($3600) to students who spend their summers working in a public interest job, as incentive to not necessarily go the much-more-lucrative corporate route because you need to earn some money.  The auction is set up to help raise the money that Harvard will use to pay these stipends.  Maybe I'm a moron, but I find a few things about this to be completely baffling:  1. Calling the $3600 a summer stipend is a public relations ploy.  We pay them a lot more than $3600 to come to school.  I'd feel much less dirty calling it a small tuition reimbursement in exchange for spending your summer helping people instead of helping corporate law firms, frankly.  2. The notion that Harvard Law School can't afford this money without holding a charity auction is absurd.  And probably insulting to actual charities, which could benefit from the money earned a lot more than Harvard Law School needs to.  It's a law school fundraiser more than it is a public interest auction -- it's to Harvard's advantage to fund people who aren't getting paid for the summer and doing public interest work because it helps them get public interest-oriented students and build up goodwill; but having to raise money to do it sort of defeats the purpose.  3. In actuality, this is a wealth redistribution scheme.  Students with money bid on the items.  The money then goes to students without money.  It's tax and transfer.  That actually may be a good thing, but if I had any money to bid on these things, I'd basically be paying to fund a classmate's summer.  Which sounds weird.  Anyway, it's actually a really big event.  Students, faculty, corporations, and famous people donate stuff.  Signed footballs, homemade cakes and cookies, etc.  Most of this stuff I'm cool with -- I think it's perfectly legitimate for a student to bake a cake for the auction to help raise money for public interest funding, or to donate an hour of golf lessons, an hour of babysitting, all sorts of personal services that students donate to be auctioned off.  What disturbs me -- and it bothers me more and more each time I think about it -- are the faculty donations.  Lunch for you and 5 friends with a professor, home-cooked meal at another professor's house, poker game with a professor, hike in the woods with a professor.  One professor will go up to the parents of the highest bidder at graduation and tell them that their child was the best student he ever had.  That last one I'm sure isn't taken completely seriously and probably doesn't actually trigger in practice the ethical issues it sounds like it might, but the rest of them bother me because they're having students pay for access to professors.  The students with the most money get to literally buy a professor's time.  Does no one else find this extraordinarily disturbing?  We're here in no small part because of the faculty Harvard has -- for the opportunity to learn from these brilliant, accomplished people.  We pay thousands of dollars in tuition for the privilege.  The thought that students can buy greater access to their professors is astonishing to me.  And incredibly awkward.  I don't want a professor having lunch with me because I've paid for the privilege.  To think that the lunchtime conversation at the rent-a-meal the professor sees as obligatory because I was the highest bidder makes me angry.  Yes, our tuition pays for access, and yes, professors probably wouldn't have office hours if they weren't getting paid a salary, but that's all kind of indirect.  To create a direct commodification of the relationship -- you give money for access?  I'm doing a bad job putting this into good words that are actually creating a persuasive argument -- I know there's some more powerful rhetoric I'm just not coming up with right now -- but this makes sense, doesn't it?  It's a profound perversion of the teacher-student relationship to allow -- encourage! -- professors to sell their time to the highest bidding student, and allow students to buy greater access to faculty.  I don't think the fact it's for a "worthy cause" -- if I can even accept that funding Harvard Law School's summer stipends is a worthy cause -- even comes close to justifying it.  Do the winners really feel comfortable with the results?  Sure, you get to have dinner at the professor's house.  But not because she wants you there.  Because you paid for it.  Thrilling.

Copyediting for the newspaper, a cappella rehearsal, more copyediting for the newspaper, and an inbox full of waiting-for-replies e-mails when I returned to my room.  The Backstreet Boys song parody promised yesterday, which I know at least two people are anxiously awaiting, will hopefully magically appear shortly after lunchtime... :)  I'll also say more about moot court and course selection soon.  In the meantime, check out  urlLink Greg Lipper's Harvard Law Record column  from tomorrow's newspaper, which has a nice comment about my columns.  I don't know Greg, and I'm sure he doesn't read my weblog, but just in case, I do appreciate the compliment.

I'm glad I didn't get too concerned about this or it would have been anti-climactic.  I really want to write a song parody about it.  The moot court program here is called Ames.  So, to the tune of the Backstreet Boys' "Quit Playing Games With My Heart," something like "I'm Losing Ames From The Start."  Look for it tomorrow.

      "It's Time for Course Selection!"  It's time for course selection!  And boy, am I excited!  Of course, before I can begin to choose my courses, I need to carefully read all of the materials they've given us.  Let's see... there's the purple book that lists the courses alphabetically by course name, the green book that talks about the visiting professors and lists their courses alphabetically by professor name, the other purple book that groups the courses into categories and discusses each of them, but in different words than the first purple book, the pamphlet - a lighter green than the green book - that groups the courses into a different set of categories but doesn't really discuss them, and, finally, the white and red book about clinicals - oh, wait, there's a second red and white book inside the first book (sneaky!) - that only talks about some courses, and repeats only a selection of the instructions from the purple book.  Okay, twenty-seven hours later.  I've read all the books.  Am I ready to choose courses?  Nope, not yet.  Page vii of the purple book: "Detailed information on the requirements of the J.D. Degree may be found on pp. 202-205 of the 2002-03 Catalog."  Okay, so I have to read that too.  Page ix: "Maximum and minimum credit requirements are set out in the Catalog...." No page reference.  Gotta read the whole book.  Twelve hours later.  Okay, ready to choose courses? Nope.  Page x: "This is a brief introduction to cross-registration. Review all cross-registration information in the HLS Catalog and in the Cross-Registration Memorandum, Calendar, and How to Complete the Cross-Registration Petition, all available at http://www.law.harvard.edu/Administrative_Services/Registrar/." Good thing I read the seventeen books the office of information technology gave out at orientation and so I've got a working Internet connection.  Two hours later.  Now?  Not yet. Page xi: "On September 12, 1975, the Dean prepared a statement about the student-faculty consultation with respect to the written work requirement. This statement is available in the Registrar's Office and second-year, third-year, and graduate students should familiarize themselves with it." Damn, it's the weekend.  Registrar's office isn't open.  Monday morning. Okay, read the statement. Can I please choose courses now? Well, maybe. What do I want to take in the fall? Well, I hear Prof. Tribe is great. So I'll sign up for his bundle. He teaches in the spring. And that would mean my Tax course would be in the fall, timeslot G. And I really want to take bankruptcy.  And that's in timeslot... G. Okay, well, everyone says Admin Law is a good class to take.  Timeslot G. Copyright sounds interesting.  It's in timeslot G.  Entertainment, Media, and the Law?  Yep, G.  I really hear good things about Tribe.  So maybe I should sign up for his fall course too. Constitution at War.  But that probably requires Con Law first.  Yeah.  And besides, it's in timeslot G.  How about International Law?  Timeslot C!  Finally!  Let me just check the bundle again... when's the corporations course?  Oh, it's timeslot C.  Uhh... perfect.  Maybe I'll sign up for Comparative Law.  Because there's no C or G in its timeslot, TBA.  How about a clinical?  Better read the procedures and rules.  Page 5 of the white and red booklet where the red stripe is above the gray stripe (as distinguished from the companion booklet, where the gray stripe is above the red stripe): "In addition to this booklet, the Preliminary Registration Bulletin, the Law School Catalog and the HLS Adviser contain important information about the clinical program."  The Adviser? More reading!  And I can't be the only person just a little bit bothered by the lack of consistency between these booklets regarding the use of the serial comma.  The purple book? Serial commas all over the place.  The clinical book? Nowhere to be found. Maybe someone forgot to read the Dean's statement from July 14, 1854 regarding the use of the serial comma in registration materials.  Okay, courses chosen.  Time to fill out the worksheet on the last page of the purple book.  "J.D. students are advised to list all 31 course choices to maximize their chances for a full schedule."  Thirty-one?  Wow.  The first thirty I'm excited about, but if I get my thirty-first choice, I'm really screwed.  I know it sounds fascinating - Policy Issues in Tax System Redesign Reading Group - but still, it does conflict with my twenty-eighth choice, Trade and Competition: Irrevocable Objectives in the Context of Developing Societies Seminar, so I don't know what I'd do.  Actually, I may just need to wait.  Page v of the purple book: "Since changes sometimes occur over the summer, students should review... the 2003-2004 Catalog, as well as the updated information in the fall Registration Adviser."  More reading!  Yippee!

      Just spent the last few hours looking at course choices for next year.  Here's what I'm thinking:  FALL Constitutional Law Bankruptcy Economics of Regulation and Antitrust Seminar on Law and Literature 1-Credit Pass-Fail Accounting Class  WINTER (we have this strange little 3-week winter term, where you take one class that meets for a whole bunch of hours every day) Food and Drug Law OR Psychiatry and the Law OR Secure Transactions  SPRING Tax Communications Law [and one more course to be determined, possibly Corporations]  A heavy fall, a lighter spring... but just because there's more stuff that interests me in the fall... recognizing that Fall Recruiting may mean that having a heavier program that semester will come back to haunt me.  Coming tomorrow: something funny about course selection, hopefully in the form of an 800-word newspaper column

      A  urlLink thread  on the Princeton Review discussion board about people going to Harvard in the fall (side note: I wonder if any of the half-dozen people who actually post on that thing read my weblog), focusing a lot on the dorms, and choosing between them.  So here's some general thoughts about housing.  Based on my 1L year, I think it was really important to live close to campus, and to have a place where I was comfortable and didn't hate.  Studying in my room, even with the distractions, I just found so much more enjoyable and less like work than going to the library.  It helped to have a home base that was pleasant to be in, and clean, and complete with bathroom that made life a little less crazy than it might have been.  Helped not to be woken up in the middle of the night by people screaming in the hall, or vomiting in the echo chamber, or whatever else disturbing people could do in a noisy dorm (as opposed to a relatively quiet dorm).  I don't think on campus / off campus mattered so much as close enough to not feel like you're commuting.  Because for the people who couldn't just go back and forth at will and had to plan their day around travel to and from home, school becomes less like a lifestyle and more like a job. And nobody likes to have to go to work in the morning.  It just feels different.  Even now, 4 days into my summer job, I ralize how much different work is from school.  Work ruins the whole day.  You have to go, and be there all day.  You can't go back home when there's nothing to do, you can't run errands, waste two hours surfing the web, take a nap... well, you can... but you feel guilty.  The great thing about the student lifestyle is that it's flexible, that it isn't a job, that you control your time.  So my advice is live close, and live comfortably.  Don't try and save $100/month by picking the apartment that smells like fish.  It's just gonna make law school that much more unpleasant.  Just my advice.

      Just in case reading three separate posts about the law review competition was too much for you, I've condensed those thoughts, added some new ones, and even come up with a few fresh jokes.  Hence, the definitive 1000 words about the law review competition.   "3 1/8 inches"  Three and one-eighth inches. No, not that. Get your mind out of the gutter.  I'm of course talking about the law review competition packet.  It's a monster.  Over twelve hundred pages.  Without any pictures.  They handed out blow pops when they were giving out the packets.  You know why?  Because it blows.  Heck, just picking up the packet - literally, just picking it up off the table, since it's so darn thick - should be enough to get someone on law review.  I was expecting a little packet, a couple of cases, some forms to fill out.  I don't know, eleven hundred pages max.  But what do I get but a 1200-page monstrosity that almost made me wish I'd only picked it up so that I could write smack about it.  Oh wait.  That *is* the reason why I picked it up.  The one thing that was missing from the packet - the only thing, I suppose - was a list of reasons to apply.  I know everyone says being on law review is great - the parties, the food, the millions of adoring fans, the free sneakers.  Oops, I'm getting it confused with being on the Celtics.  No, everyone says law review is great because without it, you're pretty much automatically disqualified from this whole bunch of jobs.  Like nine of them.  Souter, Rehnquist, Scalia, O'Connor, Stevens, Thomas, Ginsburg, Breyer, and the other dude.  The one with the black robe and the gavel.  Not Byron White but the one who's still alive.  Whatever, you know who I mean.  And so from what I gather, law review's great if you want to be one of those guys - or clerk for them, I guess.  Or if you want to be a professor.  Of law.  At Harvard.  You can still be a professor of screenwriting at Vassar without law review.  I hope.  So I totally have no issue at all with people doing the law review competition because they really want to get a job that being on law review improves their chances of getting.  That seems like a fine reason to forego sleeping for the next two years.  Really, it does.  And I guess I have no issue with the people doing it just in case - you know, you don't want to be Justice Breyer now, but maybe twenty years from now, after a law firm has sucked all the spirit of your soul, it'll seem like a cool gig.  So you do law review now, just in case.  Like the Japanese lessons and the brochure you picked up at the doctor's office about the sex change surgery.  Because you never know what you're gonna want down the road.  Like, for example, if you saw MTV's "True Life" last weekend, calf implants.  There was a crazy dude convinced that his life would be perfect if only he had bigger calves.  So he got implants.  And if you think your life would perfect if only you were on law review, then cool, go for it.  I guess I just want to know whether the line to pick up the packets was two hundred people long because there are two hundred 1Ls who really want to do stuff for which being on law review will make a difference, or whether they're just doing it because just being a normal Harvard Law student isn't prestigious enough and they need more.  I realize I've left out the category of people doing it because they really enjoy subciting and tracking down sources and undangling modifiers.  And maybe that's not what people do who are on law review.  I don't know.  It wasn't in the packet.  Or at least not on pages 1 - 347.  I stopped when I started seeing footnotes dancing in front of my eyes.  Last Friday night, after getting the packet, instead of counting sheep to fall asleep, I counted people on line to get the packet who won't end up making it onto law review.  No, actually I counted how many licks it took to get to the center of the Blow Pop.  I told a friend about the law review competition (don't worry, I don't mean I collaborated with him on my answers.  That would be a violation of the rule on page 841, footnote 62).  He said a "writing competition" didn't sound too bad.  Then I told him that meant writing a 20-page comment on a recent Supreme Court case and editing a brief.  "But editing can be fun," he said.  "I edited my sister's college application essay about the time she finally became a woman, and she got into Wellesley."  I said that's not quite what I meant. But after I showed him the packet he understood, and then he called up a bunch of law schools to withdraw all of his applications.  Another friend asked me if maybe it wasn't so bad - "you know, it's only a week of torture and then you potentially "win" the competition, right?" (And, yeah, I know it's kind of strange that all of my "friends" ask the perfect questions to fit right into my sentences.)  And what do you win?  A grueling, unpaid job.  Oh, yeah, right, great, exciting.  Again, I don't mean for this to sound like I have anything against law review.  I really don't.  I understand that it helps put people in a better position to get certain jobs, and so for people who want those jobs, or at least want the option of getting those jobs, or just like the idea that they're not excluding themselves from those jobs, or just like hard work and have some free time on their hands, it's silly not to try to get on law review.  Absolutely.  And because so many people want to be on it, they need to have a competition packet that's three and one-eighth inches thick.  I'm cool with all of that.  This is not a negative essay, this is just some rambling thoughts from someone who's still trying to recover from the hernia he got from lifting the competition packet.  But like I said before, I picked up the packet basically so that I could write about it.  So I have to say something.  And I know the ninth justice is Thurgood Marshall.  I was just trying to be funny.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, John Harlan.  Potter Stewart.  Oliver Wendell Holmes, that guy from the Dred Scott case with the funny name, Louis Brandeis, Felix Frankfurter, Anthony Kennedy. Aha!

      Grotesque Tales From the New York City Public Transportation System  Virtually verbatim, from this morning on the bus:  Man: So how's your nephew? Driver: Good, good. They grow up so fast. Man: So I have this friend who was 400 pounds. Driver: Is that so? Man: She was having trouble walking, breathing, moving.  So she went to the doctor, and they said she had some circulatory problems.  So she went into the hospital, and the blood wasn't flowing right, so they cut off a toe. Driver: Wow. Man: Yeah, and that didn't really help, so they cut off another, and then another, and one by one until all 5 were gone. Driver: And then they removed the foot? Man: No.  Then they thought she has gall stones, so they cut her open and looked inside.  And you know what they found? Driver: No, what did they find? Man: Her gall bladder was all gangrene.  Like totally black and rotted. Driver: So is she all better now? Man: No, no, she died.  Followed by this morning on the subway:  A couple comes on the train.  The man has a box of tic-tacs.  He offers his girlfriend, or wife, or whoever she is.  She says no, and gestures to the bottle of water she's got.  As if drinking water means no tic-tac.  But whatever.  So she opens her water and takes a sip and makes an awful face, like she's just swallowed a rat.  The man looks at her.  Asks if the water's bad.  She says she thinks so.  He looks at.  Says it looks ok.  He smells it.  Makes a face.  Says it smells like something's wrong with it.  She looks at it.  Says it looks ok.  She smells it.  Makes a face.  And then... And then... And then... And then she takes another sip.  Really.  If you're also subjected to the New York City public transportation system (motto: "Did you get there?  Isn't that enough?"), you may be able to recognize me -- I'm the guy constantly shifting his weight and trying to steady myself with my feet because I'm too frightened to touch any of the exposed metal surfaces.  Also funny -- heard a radio ad at some point today. I'm sure I just heard wrong, but it sounded like the commercial said: "St. Vincent's hospital.  Taking good care of patients, whether it's your first visit, or your last."  Lovely thoughts.

      I promised something funny, to make up for the not so funny post about final exams below.  Instead of funny, how about completely random?  Like this sketch about a ball of dust I found under my bed while I was studying for exams (ok, not really, but I have to at least try to make this relevant, right?)  DUST: A completely random sketch that might be funny  (scene opens on a dorm room. Bed and desk. Jeremy is sitting at his desk, studying.)  Jeremy: Stupid Evidence final tomorrow. (he slams the book closed) I wish there were no laws.  (an actor in a big round gray costume emerges from under the bed. he is a ball of dust. he dusts himself off. ha. he slowly sneaks up behind Jeremy, and taps him on the shoulder, very carefully. Jeremy turns around.)  Jeremy (startled, screaming): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  Dust: Calm down, dude.  Jeremy (scared): Who...What are you?  Dust: I'm a ball of dust. From under your bed.  Jeremy: What? What do you want?  Dust: Well, you haven't vacuumed or cleaned all year. And that's great. You know, so I don't die. So I figured I'd say thanks.  Jeremy: Uh... Okay...  Dust: And I heard you complaining about your Evidence final, and thought I might be able to help.  Jeremy: Are you a lawyer?  Dust: No.  I'm a ball of dust.  But still.  Are you a lawyer?  Jeremy: No.  Dust: So what's the difference.  Besides, the guy who roomed here last year took the same class and he was real smart. And he never cleaned either.  Filthy humans.  (Dust reaches inside himself and pulls out a sheet of crumpled paper) Just use his outline and you'll be fine.  (Jeremy grabs the sheet of paper from Dust)  Jeremy: Thanks dude. This is awesome. Hey, can you help me with my Environmental Law final too?  Dust: No, but I've got a friend who can.  (Environmental Law Dust, who looks kind of like a cloud of air pollution, emerges from under the bed)  Environmental Law Dust: I'm illegal in 49 states. But they don't care in Texas.  Jeremy: Do you know environmental law?  Environmental Law Dust: No, but I can give you asthma.  Jeremy: Close enough!  Environmental Law: I figured.  Can I go to the bathroom?  Jeremy: Sure.  Environmental Law: Don't worry, it'll be non-toxic.  I'm environmentally-friendly.  No hazardous waste coming out of me.  Jeremy: Great.  Hey, are there any more dusts under there?  (Registrar Dust comes out from under the bed)  Registrar Dust: I'm Registrar Dust.  I can help you choose classes.  (Student Loans Dust comes out from under the bed)  Student Loans Dust: I'm Student Loans Dust.  After law school, your net worth looks just like me: completely turned to dust!  Ha ha ha!  Jeremy: Maybe I should vacuum.  All the dusts scream: Noooo!  [The end.  Don't say I didn't warn you this was random...]

      Haven't said much about my spring exams, so I figure today's as good a day as any to talk about those.  The biggest thing I noticed was that people seemed a lot less concerned / stressed / intense / insane about spring exams than they had been in the fall.  Which I suppose makes sense, since we'd already been through it all once, whereas in the fall it was all brand new, and people had already gotten a set of grades and so probably at least were secure in knowledge that they could pass a law school exam, and that a B wasn't going to kill them.  Unless they got an A on everything, in which case they had another reason not to be too concerned -- because they probably had the knack for this sort of thing.  In any event, people seemed much more relaxed.  Of course, everything is relative, so by "much more relaxed" I mean still pretty insane, but just not as much as in the fall.  Last semester I made nice outlines, which it turned out I didn't really find that useful during the exam, and didn't really feel like making them was so valuable as compared with reading stuff.  So no outlines this semester.  Instead, I did lots and lots of practice exams.  As many as I could fine.  And for the ones that didn't have model answers, I did them with people so we could compare answers.  Found that to be pretty helpful.  Also tried to get my hands on lots of different outlines and find the best pieces of each one.  Didn't find that too helpful though.  It wasn't that the outlines weren't good, it was just that they didn't really help with putting everything together mentally to make the whole course fit together.  All of my exams wee open book.  I find studying for open book exams to be really frustrating because you don't need to memorize anything, and memorizing stuff doesn't matter anyway.  You just need to make sure you understand stuff well enough to be able to play around with it and wrap your head around whatever questions the professor makes up.  I found it useful in the fall for contracts to write out my own "story of contracts," trying to fit everything together into one cohesive package.  I did something similar for property this semester, but just based on the exam styles of the different professors, didn't find it to be as useful.  I think it's important to have something written out that lists everything you covered in the course so that when writing an essay or trying to spot issues, you can go down the list quickly and see if anything fits.  Just a 1-2 page issue sheet, with some keywords to remind of important concepts, units, cases, etc.  That was probably the most useful.  It's really frustrating, when the exam is 100% of the grade, to have exams that seem poorly designed for measuring knowledge and understanding.  Easy or hard, doesn't matter, I feel a little angry when the exam isn't testing what I think it ought to be testing -- when it's too vague to know what the professor is really looking for, or when it's too specific to really force you to apply concepts.  I imagine it's really hard to come up with good exams from a professor point of view, but I would guess that while grading it quickly becomes clear whether the exam was good and the answers are all on target but still differentiable, as opposed to when they're all the same because it was too easy or too right-out-of-the-book, or there's such a variation that it's clear that some people who probably had a decent enough understanding of the course just missed the boat and didn't go in the direction it was expected they'd go in, or missed the key concepts, not because they didn't understand the material but because the question was vague or unclear or just badly thought-out.  I also think there should be a permanent moratorium placed on professors making any comments about grading being random, arbitrary, vague, hard, or anything else like that.  Even if it's true, it's so not motivating.  I want to believe that the quality of my answers has something to do both with my understanding of the course, and with the grade I get.  Maybe too much to ask, but at least allow me the illusion.  My other grade reform would be that I think they should have to share samples of an A answer and a B-minus or C answer after the exam is over -- I want to see what people are and aren't doing that's causing them to do well or poorly.  Otherwise we're left kind of clueless -- how good is the best answer? How bad is the worst?  Which one am I closer to?  And is there something stupid I'm not doing -- like creating subheadings, or drawing diagrams, or whatever -- that alone could give me higher grades without actually having anything to do with my comprehension.  Just curious.  That's a long paragraph.  Without a real point.  Gosh.  Rambling about exams.  Hmm.  Hope someone finds it sorta interesting, I guess.  Sorry about the lack of funny in there.  Maybe something funny later tonight?  Any ideas? :)

      MTV's "True Life" this past weekend (yes, I watched MTV's "True Life."  And, yes, I could have been doing the law review competition instead) featured young people getting plastic surgery.  Two girls -- aspiring Playboy models (are there internships you can get for that?) getting some assorted breast, nose, and thigh work done, one tremendously overweight girl trying to become merely obese, and one particularly disturbed guy getting "calf implants" because "[he] wants big calves" to impress all of his friends.  Because the first thing I look for when picking my friends is big calves.  Anyway, he got his new calves, the surgery pretty much paralyzed him for a few days, but then he was off to the bar to show off.  "Big calves!  Who cares?" was pretty much the reaction of his friends.  But he went off to pursue his dream of being a male model (a sock model, perhaps?).  After the surgery, I kept waiting for him to say, "well, I got my calves, but now my elbows are too small!  I need big elbows!"  And why is any of this related to law school?  Well, if you go to law school, then after exams, you too will have time to watch MTV's "True Life."  And also, you'll be able to wonder what the contracts these doctors make the patients sign before surgery look like, and if they're open to any liability at all if the new claves aren't big enough, or they mess up and give you big knees or big ankles instead.  You can also spend time wondering about malpractice insurance.  Law school: it can even turn watching MTV into a lesson in adhesion contracts.  (Thanks to Roger, for reminding me I watched this thing.  Thanks to MTV, for costing me brain cells.)

      I mentioned something in yesterday's post about starting a summer job today.  Particularly alert readers (read: obsessive stalkers of mine) may have noticed that was probably the first time I'd mentioned anything about a summer job, at least since December, when we were first allowed to send out resumes.  And the mention in passing yesterday didn't really say anything other than "I have a summer job, and it starts tomorrow."  There's a reason I've spent more words talking about the cafeteria food than anything having to do with my summer job.  And now that the summer has started, I feel relatively comfortable sharing a story I've been saving, and reluctant to post while I was still looking for summer work.  Back on December 1st, when we were first allowed to send out resumes, it felt like all of my classmates were literally racing to the post office.  I had friends applying to over a hundred law firms, or twelve dozen public interest organizations, or every Starbucks on the East Coast.  I had been delaying actually sitting down and thinking about the summer job search -- I thought I'd gone to law school to avoid looking for a job, and now, three months in, we had to start sending resumes out?  And once I did start thinking about it, I figured that regardless of what I want to do next summer and in the future beyond law school, it probably made sense for me to try to get something different for this summer, so I could explore some other options.  And since it's relatively easy for 2Ls to get summer jobs at firms, but less easy for 1Ls to do so, especially in this economy, by not even trying for a firm job, I wasn't really costing myself anything.  But it's hard to get hired for something that isn't a law firm in December, when the summer is six months away.  And there's pressure to do *something,* since everyone else is.  So I looked through the Public Interest Job Guide we'd received, and I identified a handful of public interest organizations that I'd totally consider working for, in areas I'm interested in.  I wasn't passionate about public interest legal work -- but I thought I'd explore, send out some resumes, see if any opportunities ended up sounding really good and would be a nice fit.  Totally in good faith, just not things that I was truly passionate about -- not that all of my friends sending out resumes to corporate law firms were totally passionate about them either.  So I sent out a dozen resumes, and I posted something flip on the weblog, like "just sent a dozen resumes to places I don't really want to work."  Not completely the truth -- it wasn't that I didn't want to work there, just that I wasn't dying to work at any of them, at least not until I'd found out some more about them and what exactly a public-interest legal organization does, anyway -- but not completely a lie.  And a week later, I received an e-mail from someone at one of them, saying, basically, "Thanks for your resume, but according to your weblog, you don't really want to work here.  Best of luck."  And my stomach dropped.  And I realized that I needed to be careful.  I mean, she had every right to send me that e-mail -- although I'm not sure she didn't overreact to the post -- but it scared me that I was potentially making myself unemployable by writing this thing, and not doing it anonymously.  But for every hundred potential employers who might find my weblog, decide they don't think my song parodies are very funny, and decide not to hire me because of it, there might be one who reads it and thinks it's pretty funny.  And that's probably the place I want to work anyway.  So I decided it's worth the risk.  But you're not going to find out what my summer job is anywhere in this post.  Or tomorrow's, or the next day's.  Because it wouldn't be fair to them, it wouldn't be particularly courteous, and man would I be scared they'd find it and fire me.  Even though I have nothing bad at all to say.  Day one was awesome, and I can't wait for day two.  So, the moral of my story, fellow webloggers and aspiring webloggers, heed my warning, even if it's six months late.  They're gonna find it.  So be careful.  And be nice to the elderly, too.  Because they're generally pretty nice people.

      Decided not to do the law review competition.  Actually, hadn't really planned on doing it, but by picking it up I thought I'd at least give myself the chance to get motivated and potentially change my mind.  My reasoning for not doing it?  (1) I don't think that for the things I want to do in the future, which -- at least now, and without law review, I guess never -- don't include clerking for a Supreme Court justice or being a Harvard Law professor -- that law review would be particularly necessary, and, in fact, (2) my current extracurricular activities, most of which I'd probably have to drop if I were to make law review, might actually be more helpful.  I want to make sure I have time to write, that I have time to work on the newspaper, that I have time to sing in the a cappella group and act in the law school Parody show, that I have time to hang out with friends, to enjoy my classes... and (3) I really enjoyed the past year, and the balance I found between class and law-related stuff, and stuff that was less law-related.  I'm more than a little worried that adding a 40-hour-a-week job to the mix -- a job that, by all accounts, isn't particularly enjoyable or relaxing -- would mess that up, and make me enjoy life a bit less.  Not worth it. To me.  Worth it to others, and that's totally understandable and sensible and great for them.  I'm not at all trying to say I think law review is stupid or a bad idea for everyone or even automatically a trade-off.  There are people who like checking footnotes and editing articles, and there are people who have serious goals for which law review makes a lot of sense.  (4) A side consideration is that I start my summer job tomorrow, and so I probably wouldn't have had time this week to give the competition the effort and energy it would take to make it on.  So it turns out that I did only pick up the packet in order to write about it and find stuff to make fun of.  Which was my hunch all along.  It frightens me a little that I even thought about doing it.  The only reason I was tempted is because it's a competition, and "winning" a spot on law review, even if I didn't want it, would feel nice.  More than one professor told us this year that just by being at Harvard, we've "won" the race, and we'll all do fine, and we can stop competing.  But in the back of everyone's mind, I think it's hard to get out of the mode of competing and wondering if you "have what it takes" and how you compare to your classmates.  And it felt silly to automatically pass up something prestigious and desirable and wanted without even trying to get it.    I'm gonna try an analogy here, although it's probably not a very good one.  I think of law review as a pile of rocks, and the law review competition as a race to the rockpile.  Some people really want rocks -- for their slingshots, for the construction project they're working on, for their rock collection.  Lots of reasons to want a pile of rocks.  And if you do have a slingshot, or a construction project, or a rock collection, those rocks are really desirable, and really helpful.  And they're lovely rocks, so even if you don't need them, if you win the rockpile, people are going to think you're pretty special.  "Wow, you've got nice rocks."  Some people will be really impressed by the rocks, whether or not you actually need them for anything.  But if you don't need them, you've got this big pile of rocks, and nothing to do with them -- they're hard to move, they take time to bring to the rock deposit, they take up space you could use for your shell collection, or you refrigerator magnet collection, they block the door so it's hard for people to get in, and this big pile of rocks casts a big shadow and makes it hard for anything else you're doing to really stand out.  And the race is pretty long.  So if you don't want the rocks, and they're only going to cause trouble, maybe it's okay not to even run the race.  What a long and convoluted analogy.  I'm spending way too many words explaining this.  Probably I'll turn this into an 800-word "law review summary entry" in a couple of days, but besides that, I think that's enough words on law review.  Until I change my mind on Thursday night and stay up for 24 straight hours writing.  Right.

      Not law-related but kind of funny: my mom was telling me about a woman she works with who's having a baby.  She saw the sonogram and found out that it's a boy.  Now she's telling her co-workers: "I could tell, he has a really big [you know what word goes here] -- just like my husband."  From the sonogram!  Seemed funnier when my mom told me the story.  Oh well.

      Linking to a weblog over at  urlLink Sanction Films  that was kind enough to link to me.  Their film project, "In the Bathroom," a spoof of "In the Bedroom," sounds pretty funny just from the title.  I'm been meaning to link to them for a few days now, but was waiting for a weblog post that gave me something to say in response so I could combine the link with something substantive to say.  And today, there's a post that's awfully sad, but I think conveys feelings that we all have some of the time, when we're frustrated, or lonely, or just scared of the future out there unknown.  He writes, in part:  "I am 23 years old, and the more I go through life the more I realize that no one cares. No one cares if you go to work. No one cares if you don't wake up today. No one cares if you don't pick up your dry cleaning this Tuesday. No one cares about what happened to you on the way home...  No one is going to make you become something. You have to do it yourself or it is just not going to happen."  He sounds like someone who needs some good old-fashioned graduate school.  :)  I'm actually completely serious.  One of the great things about law school -- and one of the reasons I decided to go, really -- is that no matter how meaningless the day seems, how useless you feel, how little you get done, at the end of the day, in the back of your mind, you know at least you're getting a degree at the end.  That you're working towards *something.*  That you won't wake up in three years and find that you're three years older and have nothing to show for it.  You've wasted all of this time and what for?  At least you have a degree.  Maybe it's not a degree you want, but it has value.  It can get you a job.  It can make your wall more crowded, and your resume look prettier.  And even at its worst, it fills the day with classes to sit through and surrounds you with people your own age to interact with, and fills your weeks with activities and assignments and a feeling of purpose.  The two years I spent in between finishing undergrad and starting law school were often interesting, often enjoyable, and often worthwhile.  And there were also days that I came home, sat on my bed, and wondered "What in the world am I doing? Where will this lead?  Why am I here?"  Those feelings simply don't exist at law school.  Vanished.  Gone.  I'm in school, I'm getting a degree, it's fun, there's stuff to keep me busy, I'm never stuck sitting in my room doing nothing, it's great.  No complaints.  Lacking a sense of purpose?  I don't say that law school is necessarily the answer, but find something -- anything -- with a carrot at the end of the journey.  So you're building towards something and no day can ever truly be deemed a complete waste of time.  Or at least that's an idea.  I don't know.  Writing at one in the morning is never a good idea... this entry needs a meaningless top ten list to balance the melancholy.  And so...  Top Ten Classes Not Offered by Any Law School.  Or at least not any ABA-accredited law school.  1. The Law of One-Celled Organisms 2. Extraterrestrial Legal Regimes 3. Torte Law (the pastry kind) 4. The Law of Oligarchy 5. Prison Law 6. Fungus and the Law 7. History of Traffic Court 8. Law and Breakfast Cereal seminar 9. Clinical Workshop: Influencing the US News Rankings Through Subterfuge 10. Uncivil Procedure

      Questions and Answers about the Harvard Law Review writing competition from someone who knows nothing more than they're telling us in the packet and readily admits that he really doesn't know what all of the benefits and burdens of actually being on law review are, whether or not it's a good idea for everyone to try to get on or just people with certain specific career goals, and whether or not being on law review would mean having to drop lots of other activities and never see your friends again:  "Finals just ended three days ago.  And now I can choose to spend another week doing grueling law-related work?  Ooh, I'm excited -- tell me more!"  Gladly. It's the Harvard Law Review writing competition.  Each year, the Law Review chooses its new editors (everyone who's on Law Review is called an editor) through a writing competition that takes place the week after finals.  Any 1L can choose to participate, and is given exactly a week to do the competition.  "A writing competition!  That sounds like fun!"  Uh, maybe.  The term "writing competition" is actually a bit misleading.  It makes it sound like you have to write an essay, or something like that.  You actually have to complete two tasks -- editing a 30-page excerpt from a law review article that's been doctored so that it has lots and lots of mistakes, and then writing your own 20-page case comment about a recent prominent court case.  "What do you mean by 'prominent'?"  I mean it's something I'm guessing I should have probably heard of but I haven't, since my only sources of news are the Daily Show and that 60-second news break at 10 minutes before the hour, every hour, on MTV.  And the only court cases they mention on there are about Eminem and Puff Daddy.  "Editing an article doesn't sound so bad.  After all, I edited my little sister's college application essay about the first time she got her period, and she got into Wellesley!"  It's not really that kind of editing.  They give you a stack of paper -- and I mean a stack like pancakes, not a stack like playing cards -- that has all of the sources (court cases, law review articles, ancient Cyrillic texts) used, and you have to read them to make sure they're not misrepresented, or misquoted, or misinterpreted.  And then you also have to do all the standard editing stuff like figure out whether any modifiers are dangling, infinitives are split, the voice is passive, any redundancies, misspellings, etc.  "But you get a week to edit a 30-page article?  It really doesn't seem that bad."  But you're forgetting about the case comment part, where you have to write a 20-page paper about a case, relying on 722 pages of support materials to make your argument. You have to do that too.  "Is that '722' one of those fake made-up numbers you sometimes use when you're trying to exaggerate for comic effect?"  No.  "Oh.  Remind me again why I'd be putting myself through this thing for a week?"  To get on law review.  Or at least to try and get on law review.  Apparently something like 250 people (out of 550 1Ls) pick up the competition, 175 or so hand it in, and they accept about 40.  So it's certainly not a slam dunk even if you do the competition.  "And I want to get on law review... why?"  I wish they'd be more explicit about this, because tons and tons of people want to get on law review, and I'm not completely certain why.  I understand that it's pretty much required if you want to clerk for the Supreme Court -- but so few people are in a position to do that anyway -- and that it's an awful big help if you want to be a law professor at a place like Harvard, although you can certainly still be a professor at lots of other schools -- and there's a lot more besides law review you need to do to make yourself a viable candidate for a professorship.  So for these very small number of jobs...  "But if it's just a week of torture, isn't it worth it?"  Oh, totally.  I definitely think it's totally worth it if it was just this week of competition.  What makes me hesitate is that if you make it onto law review, you're basically accepting a full time job doing this same kind of work -- editing, checking footnotes, and, in one instance, writing a case comment or note of some sort, if I'm not mistaken.  For those accepted, they return to campus on August 11th and do law review work until school starts, and then basically work upwards of 40 hours a week on this stuff all year.   Plus go to class, in a few exceptional cases.  And so it becomes difficult to balance law review with classwork with other activities and commitments, plus hanging out with friends and relaxing and stuff like that.  So in cases where people have fulfulling lives already, and want to do more than law review, I don't know if it's worth it.  "But I love Justice Souter."  Doesn't everybody.  But even with law review on the resume, it's still awfully hard to get to be his clerk.  "But it seems silly to pass up an opportunity that most people would kill for -- there's got to be a reason it's such a competition.  And you don't know what you're going to want to be doing ten years from now, and if all that will be holding you back is not having been on law review.  It seems stupid not to at least do it and give yourself a chance -- don't arbitrarily close doors that can be of great value in the future, robbing yourself of future success and happiness..."  Lay off the crack, dude.  No, you're right.  And that's why I picked the packet up.  And that's why I'm kind of torn. Right now, the opportunities Law Review makes easier aren't things that I'm really interested in.  But who knows.  And silly to pass this stuff up without at least giving it a shot, getting rejected, and then at least saying you tried.  Otherwise you run the risk of blaming yourself down the road.  "But let's get serious for a second.  The only reason you picked the packet up is not because you really think you're gonna do the competition, but because you wanted to write about it and find stuff to make fun of."  Well... on some level...   "And another thing -- don't you think it's a little bit arrogant for you to be devoting all these words to a debate with yourself about whether or not to try out for the Harvard Law Review.  Many people in this world -- most of whom post on the Princeton Review law school message boards -- would give their little sister away just to have this choice."  Yeah, I know, and I don't mean for it to sound that way, because it's not like it's causing me any inner turmoil or I'm having nightmares about it, or anything like that.  It's really not a big deal, and I have this 1200-page packet in front of me, and no real desire to be on law review or spend the next week doing this competition... but I figured some people out there in weblog-reader-land would be interested anyway.  Because it's kind of interesting.  Maybe.  "You're petering out.  I think it's time to end this post."  I think you're right.  But wait -- I have a one-liner I've been meaning to fit in here somewhere -- "I picked up the law review writing competition packet.  And at over 1200 pages and 46,000 pounds, that in itself is an accomplishment that should be enough to get me on law review."  And, yeah, the 46,000 is one of those made-up numbers for comic exaggeration.  Okay, now I'm done.  See you later.  Tell your sister I say hi.  "Sure, no problem."

      3 1/8 inches.  No, not that.  The law review competition packet.  More pages than I can count.  But not more pages than  urlLink Waddling Thunder  can count.  He has some thoughts on the law review writing competition, which, until I unpack my stuff from lots and lots of bags now that I've returned home, should suffice.  I should note that it's pretty apparent from his post that Mr. Thunder is awfully serious about this thing and intends to put in the requisite gazillion hours of work to do really well and make it onto the Law Review.  Meanwhile, I think it's a pretty big accomplishment just to have measured how thick it is.  He's bought binders and stuff.  I read the instructions.  He's gonna do it.  I'm gonna find funny things to say about it.  I wish him luck.

      An eyewitness account of the Yale explosion at  urlLink TimSchnabel.net .  Super scary.  I can't imagine how freaked out the students there must be.  Seems like nothing's really safe anymore.  I'd trade a bit of personal freedom for a bit of security, I think.  Metal detectors at the door of every public building, security guards, bag searches... I'd be cool with all of it, if it can potentially stop bad stuff.  Of course, then they'll just do bad stuff that doesn't come through doorways and in bags....  No real solution I guess.  But, man, that Yale explosion is freaking me out.  Thank goodness no one was in the room.  Wow.

      "It's Over"  It's finally over.  38 weeks, over 383,000 minutes since it began.  American Idol has ended.  Oh, and the school year has too.  As of 4:30 this afternoon, assuming they didn't change the curve so half of us fail, I'm no longer a 1L.  My classmates and I have gained wisdom, knowledge, and carpal tunnel syndrome.  We've lost our innocence, our souls, and thousands of dollars in tuition.  The next time we go to class, there'll be people on campus who know less than we do.  And that's a really scary thought.  It seems like only yesterday that I arrived on campus for orientation and quickly realized I had no idea how it was possible for Massachusetts Avenue to bend a full 90 degrees at Harvard Square, and no idea why the sidewalk on one side of the street simply vanished in the middle of a 5-way intersection.  The first night, I was walking back to campus after dark, and actually had to ask a security guard where Massachusetts Avenue was.  He told me I was standing on it.  I told him I went to the Kennedy School.  Don't want to give law students a bad name.  I'm excited to be finished, but a little scared.  Scared that from here on, instead of being on the way in, I'm on the way out.  Three years is short, and made shorter by the fact that by the middle of the fall, most of us will probably already know where we'll be working upon graduation.  Our experiences won't be as new, our fears won't seem as important, and our outlines won't be as long.  Instead of seeing the same faces in every classroom, we'll see lots of new faces, and, probably, if my elective this semester is a representative example, lots of empty seats.  The guy sitting next to me in Con Law won't understand my jokes about 1L classes.  He'll just think I'm strange.  Then he'll stop showing up to class.  And I'll just have to whisper sarcastic comments to myself.  I have piles of paper on my floor.  I have notes from last semester that I don't need.  I have four copies of every Word file on my computer in my bookcase, and three more copies strewn across the room in no particular sequence.  I don't need any of these things.  I will never need to know the twenty-seven elements of a successful adverse possession claim again.  I probably never even knew them to begin with.  But I have a plan.  A plan to recoup 0.1% of my tuition.  I am going to sell my class notes on eBay.  "Learn what it's like to be a Harvard Law student.  Pretend you finished grad school.  Light a big fire.  Torts notes come with two thousand pages of background reading and a book about feminism.  Buyer pays shipping.  For entertainment purposes only.  Accuracy of legal statements not guaranteed.  For actual legal problems, call an actual lawyer."  I'm setting the reserve price at forty-seven cents.  Hopefully someone will bite.  Probably an incoming 1L, super-concerned about making a good first impression.  Someone for whom this will all be new, for whom this will all be important, for whom this will all matter now more than it will a year from now.  I'm going to miss it here this summer.  Not the weather, although the last few weeks have almost made up for the mini-Ice Age we experienced for much of the year.  And not the food at the cafeteria, which I can't go two weeks in a row without mentioning at least once. But the friends I've made, and the things I've learned.  Occasionally I'll be walking across the campus and it'll hit me that I'm actually a student at Harvard Law School.  Totally wild.  I feel like I'm still seven years old.  No way I should be at law school.  It's cool.  I think sometimes my classmates and I take for granted where we are and how special it is.  All it takes is a few minutes reading Princeton Review's online law school discussion board to see how much people would give to be in our shoes (ooh, maybe I can sell my shoes on eBay too).  We get to sit in the same seats as some very famous people did, before they had laptops, when casebooks were thinner (think of how many fewer cases they would have had to pick from a hundred years ago...) and when coffee mugs weren't seventy-six ounces and the size of our heads.  So they probably weren't as cramped.  But still, pretty cool.  I still have a box filled with the stuff Harvard sent me last summer, before school started.  My course list, with professors named E. Warren and R. Kennedy that made me wonder if one had to be a former chief justice or slain brother of a president in order to teach at Harvard Law School.  The Black's Law Dictionary I got as a gift last summer that has not been opened even once.  The Harvard coffee mug I've never used.  In the blink of an eye, it will be September again.  I'll have stories to tell about my summer, brand new classes to attend, old friends to reconnect with and new friends to make.  I'll have 1Ls asking for my outlines and wishing they were in my shoes.  I'll never be a 1L again.  But it's been an awesome year.  P.S. No worries (not that you're worrying...) that just because the school year has ended means nothing more to say on the weblog.  There'll be no interruption in service.  :)  And hopefully I'll have some time to reflect on the first year of school and offer some insights that might be helpful to people on their way in, on their way out, or just curious.  I'll have thoughts about my recent exams sometime in the next few days, after they've had a chance to sink in, and some thoughts about the different things people I know are doing this summer.  I'll probably take a look back and reflect on things I wish I knew and wish I'd done before law school, and things I would have done differently this year.  Things I'm glad I did, things I regret, things that no one should go to law school without doing.  And, of course, shoot me an e-mail if there's anything you, random reader, would like to see me write about.  When I started writing the weblog last August, I didn't really know if it would be anything more than a brief experiment.  I'm pleased and relieved that I've been able to keep it going all year, and hopefully I've been somewhat amusing and informative.  I know I've enjoyed writing it, and I truly hope that you, random reader, have enjoyed reading it and will continue to visit.  The cyber-connections I've made through this forum have truly enriched my life.

      I'm too afraid to really do this, but I kind of want to sell my reading packets on eBay.  See, for torts we didn't have a casebook, just packet upon packet of reading.  Like 2000 pages total.  It's interesting stuff, and I'm sure I could write a compelling description, like "Learn what it's like to be a Harvard Law student by purchasing this big stack of readings from a 1L torts class.  Exam included.  Buyer pays shipping."  And maybe someone would even bid.  Some super-motivated incoming student who's really curious and wants to get a head start.  But I'd hate for the professor to feel bad if he somehow heard about it, although it's really no different from selling casebooks back to bookstore... I don't know, it feels different.  I'm tempted though.  Because I don't what else to do with these 2000 pages besides throw them on a shelf somewhere.  They were interesting to read, but I don't know that I need to ever read them again... anyone want them?

      Note the change in the description in the upper left.  I've finished my last exam.  I'm done.  Of course, like everything else, it's sort of anti-climactic.  No real change in the world, other than no exams left.  It's not like the school blew up.  Oh, wait, that would be a different law school.   urlLink Explosion at Yale Law School .  Scary stuff.  My initial theory was that someone's head got too big and just blew up.  But that's only funny if the story wasn't true.  It's pretty frightening, actually.

      This headline in today's NY Times caught my eye, and is actually sort of related to the Torts exam I've got tomorrow:  urlLink Doctor Admits He Did Needless Surgery on the Mentally Ill   "An eye doctor who preyed on the severely mentally ill pleaded guilty yesterday to a nearly $1 million fraud scheme in which he routinely rounded up residents of some of New York City's most notorious adult homes and subjected them to unnecessary surgery or charged for thousands of procedures that were never done."  "They said that on patient charts, Dr. Debbi made notations like: "Smart. Do not invite," or "Confused. Must invite."   "Dr. Debbi's scheme was so flagrant that at one point, prosecutors said, he billed the government for multiple services on a resident's eye even though the resident was missing that eye."

      From an e-mail from the professor whose exam I have on Wednesday:  "I wanted to let you know ahead of time that the exam  appears to be quite long.  You will discover upon closer review that, in fact, the exam is merely long (as opposed to "quite long").  You should expect to spend a sizeable chunk of time reading the exam before you do much writing.  The reading, though, will often be light and interesting and should go fast."  Well, now I'm excited...

      To the tune of Disney's "When You Wish Upon A Star," it's a song all about Regulatory Takings  When you're taking property, from a citizen like me You must fairly compensate or else I'll sue  If the right you take is core, does not matter what it's for  That's per se, and courts today will punish you  BRIDGE: Value's down, my expectations lost The diminution of my land is crucial  Fairness is the guiding light, show the court that you are right When the city takes your property, they'll pay

      Coming to CBS this fall... In Vitro Survivor.  One woman.  Three fertility drugs.  Four infrared cameras.  Eight fetuses.  Tune in each week as the fetuses compete head-to-head* for the ultimate prize: birth.  A nine-month journey with only one winner, as each week viewers will call and vote for the fetus they'd like to see voted out of the womb.  The fetus with the most votes each week will be terminated; the rest will move on to more competition.  Watch the fetuses compete for food, drink, and the occasional (amniotic) sac of prizes.  The tangled relationships (and umbilical cords) will leave viewers gasping for air.  Don't miss... In Vitro Survivor.       *Competitions the first three months will not be head-to-head, since the fetuses will not yet have developed heads

      "Books, be gone."  "Here you go.  Ten, twenty, thirty, thirty-five, thirty-six, thirty-seven.  Thirty-seven cents.  Thanks for selling your books back to the bookstore.  Have a nice day."  Okay, so it wasn't quite that bad.  But it was close.  I've sold back three casebooks and a statutory supplement so far - over $200 in initial value - and received $37.50 from the bookstore.  And in the fall, they'll get about a hundred and fifty bucks for 'em, for a tidy profit margin of 300%.  They wouldn't even take back my Federal Rules of Civil Procedure book.  They said there'll be a new edition in the fall.  Like the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are really changing so much year after year that it's worth it.  Sanctions for this, penalties for that, whatever.  Like we're actual practicing lawyers who need to know the real rules or something.  I've heard two reasons from people as to why they don't sell their books back.  The first is that a bookshelf full of law books looks really impressive.  To who?  Illiterate house guests?  These must be the same people who tell their friends how much all of their clothing costs.  "I paid four thousand dollars for this gold watch.  It was on sale.  It's really worth nine thousand dollars.  And my socks are made of gold too."  "Oh yeah?  I got this watch in a McDonalds Happy Meal.  And the closest I have to gold socks are Gold Toe.  But they have holes in them."  I don't want a bookshelf filled with books like "Property Law," "Criminal Procedure," and "2002 Uniform Commercial Code Annotated Special Edition."  I don't think it's impressive, I think it's boring.  If I walked into someone's house and saw all of those books, besides being concerned the shelves would collapse from the weight and fall on me, breaking my gold watch, I would think that person was dull and dreary.  Like if they had "National Cactus Journal," and "Modern Fireplace" magazines on their coffee table.  CVS had a magazine all about chandeliers last time I was in there buying some socks and a brand new watch.  I think it was called "Chandelier Life," or something like that.  Who's buying these things?  Probably whoever's married to the lawyer who's got shelves full of "Tax Code, 2002."  The second reason I've heard as to why people keep their books is because they want them as reference materials.  For the next time you're dying to know which justices concurred in the Upjohn case and can't remember your Lexis password.  When am I ever going to need to be re-reading these cases?  Will I be bored one day and yearning for a series of perplexing notes and questions to ponder over a cup of tea served in a three-hundred dollar tea cup while wearing my new gold cufflinks?  Will I be desperate for a four-inch thick book to balance the leg of a severely unbalanced coffee table?  Will I need a heavy object to throw at the intruder who has come to steal my fancy chandelier?  Perhaps people think they can one day use their casebooks to teach their kids how to read.  "Assumpsit, daddy.  I think the word's assumpsit."  When I was a kid I remember seeing a Supreme Court paper dolls book in a discount bookstore.  All of the justices in their underwear, with paper clothes and paper robes to put on them.  Just seeing it in the store scarred me for life.  Someone really thought that Sandra Day O'Connor and William Rehnquist in their underwear made for an appropriate children's book.  Yeah, so I don't want my textbooks.  And the bookstore apparently doesn't either, or not much, anyway.  My plan after my exam in International Environmental Law was actually to sell the book back on my way to my room after the test.  In my own head I thought that would be making a very subtle statement about how valuable the book is to me.  "I don't even want you coming back into my room now that you've outlived your usefulness.  I'm done with you, you, you stupid casebook!"  True story - a guy in front of me in line at the bookstore when I was selling back books tried to return a study guide, still in its original shrink wrap.  Still in its original shrink wrap.  "I got it for the wrong casebook.  I just want to exchange it for a different one."  "No.  No returns on study guides."  "But it's still in the shrink wrap.  You can just put it back on the shelf."  "Not like that I can't."  'Not like what?"  "No returns.  No exchanges."  "But it's in the shrink wrap."  "No."  What are they, book nazis?  It's in shrink wrap.  Unless the bookstore is also selling do-it-yourself shrink-wrap machines (mine's made of gold and cost me three zillion dollars), he couldn't have photocopied it or done whatever else they think we do with study guides that makes them unreturnable (the pornographic treatises and hornbooks, I kind of understand why they're unreturnable...).  So take my books from me, evil bookstore.  Turn my dollars into casebooks into pennies.  Impoverish me so that you can continue to earn monopoly profits, and double the price of umbrellas whenever it's raining (you didn't think anyone noticed, did you?). Lure me in with your promises of cash back.  Where's my cash back, law school bookstore?  It's certainly not in my used books....

      The water coming out of the sink in my dorm room this morning is brown.  Like the cover of my civil procedure casebook.  I know I've been in law school too long when everything reminds me of my casebooks.  By mid-morning, at least a half-dozen people in my building will already have filed a lawsuit against the housing office in response to the brown water, and by tomorrow, there'll be a new course offering scheduled for next semester, called "Dormitory Water Law."  By next week, Johnnie Cochran will have been hired to defend the school ("What do the students have against *brown* water?  This is discrimination at its worst."), and they'll eventually negotiate a settlement -- perhaps a free bottle of natural spring water and a new toothbrush.  In a few years, there'll be a movie about it: "The Water Runs Brown" starring John Travolta as the prosecuting attorney, driven to ensure justice is served for the poor students, Julia Roberts as the crafty up-and-coming law student who never gives up the fight, and Tommy Lee Jones as the housing director, in search of the real culprit, the one-armed man with a bucket of food coloring.

      ...excuse this short interruption in the usual content for some self-indulgent commercial messages... (there's real content right below this message, I promise!!)  I had dinner tonight at the home of a cousin of mine in Newton.  I mention this mostly because I think he's probably going to search the Internet to see if he can find my weblog, since it came up in conversation.  The food was awesome.  It always is.  His wife's a fantastic cook.  If you're my cousin, and you've found my weblog, welcome... :)  (If not, welcome anyway...)     Speaking of things that aren't related to law school... Check out  urlLink Steve Hofstetter's weblog  if you like.  I went to high school with Steve, and he writes a weekly humor column called Observational Humor.  We've sort of lost touch (I should probably e-mail him), so he has no reason to know I read his column, or that I have a weblog of my own.  But maybe if I link to him, he'll see in his referrer logs that people are coming to his site from my site and he'll come check this one out and then I'd have an actual reason to e-mail him.  Although who doesn't like getting e-mail.  ...and now back to your regularly scheduled humorous thoughts about law school...

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  makes fun of the Star Market's sign that "Federal State Law prohibits the sale of individual sticks of butter" because there's no such thing as "federal state law."  I think he's been at law school too long.  Because my first reaction to that sign would have nothing to do with federal state law, but with why exactly the law prohibits the sale of individual sticks of butter (I thought butter was bad for us -- yet we're required to buy it in bulk??), and, even more so, why the Star Market needs to put up a sign about it.  Is there a gang of "butter bandits" running around Cambridge trying to buy single sticks of butter?  Has Star Market recently been faced with people opening up butter packages, removing individual sticks, and attempting to purchase them?  Is the US government subsidizing butter producers (I was about to say "butter farmers" but quickly realized that can't be right) by requiring us to buy more than we need?  Don't do it, Star Market.  Don't let the FDA create these butter purchasing regulations and interfere with the normal workings of the free market.  If I want to buy a single stick of butter, why shouldn't I be able to?  Why is there a law to stop me?  Is this what lawmakers are spending their time doing?  "Well, Senator, I know we wanted to talk about terrorism some more, but first I have a proposal to put on the table.  I think we should prohibit the sale of individual sticks of butter."  "But why?"  "Because I'm senile."  "Oh."  "And while we're at it -- let's prohibit the sale of cheese in any size smaller than a five pound block, and rolls of paper towel in anything fewer than a 24-pack."  "Gotcha."

      Making my way through my Property class notes... there's a lot of property law.  I guess there's probably a lot of law in every subject we take, but just that we've learned more of it in Property.  I need to do laundry -- and since I don't have any clean socks, I'm wearing sandals today.  It's perfectly reasonable for my clean laundry to determine what footwear I choose, right?  :)  I promised something about exam studying... here's ten things not to do when studying for exams:  1. Light matches near your outlines 2. Take advantage of the early-bird "sell your books back before you study" promotion 3. Throw lots of sequenced but un-numbered papers high in the air and watch them scatter as they fall 4. Overdose on sleeping pills 5. Take exactly the recommended dosage of sleeping pills 6. Buy sleeping pills and, just to consolidate the number of bottles you have, mix them with your vitamins 7. Become addicted to the Food Network 8. Become addicted to Food 9. Become addicted to sleeping pills 10. Blind yourself with acid  Here's ten more actual study tips for exams that aren't just me trying to be funny but probably not succeeding:  1. If it's an open book exam, gather all the relevant materials you can possibly get your hands on, because they can't hurt 2. Make an index of all the big thick things you have, like textbooks and big piles of class notes 3. Post-It flags can be useful I'm sure, although I have yet to find a good use for them 4. Stock up on highlighters: I am not kidding, I have gone through 4 this week so far.  I've resorted now to using the purple one that's always the last one in the package because it's so ugly 5A. Don't waste time posting to your weblog every day :) 5B. Don't waste time carefully setting the lineups for your 6 fantasy baseball teams every day :) 6. Take advantage of professor office hours -- maybe they'll be giving away hints inadvertently 7. Budget your time, making sure to leave breaks -- for, say, posting to your weblog 8. Wake up early 9. Delete all solitaire and solitaire-like games from your computer 10. This is not the week to go out and buy the new book about Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane ("Moneyball" by Michael Lewis), and spend time reading that instead of reading property.  (review of Moneyball coming later in the week... I ought to practice what I preach... good book though)

       urlLink Wadding Thunder  writes about how as he reviews for exams, he's finding that in the class where he volunteered the most, he remembers what he said, and that his comments provide memory clues to other important points made in class -- basically that he can use his comments made in class as a roadmap to recalling more of the subject matter.  Hence, a reason to volunteer.  (I hope I'm not completely misrepresenting his point here)  I have an alternative approach, and a way to get the same memory-jogging exam help without actually having to think of relevant things to say, raise your hand, and risk the wrath of your peers for volunteering too much in class.  You see, I occassionally write limericks in my notes, like, for instance, about the case of Vosburg v. Putney in Torts class, where I wrote something like:  It was only a kick to the shin That stirred the diseases within A kick to the knee A lawsuit or three In the end, the boy Vosburg did win  And going back through my notes, I'm finding that for the cases about which I wrote limericks, I remember the facts much better than the ones for which I stared into space or counted the number of empty seats in the classroom.  Hence, my lesson: writing limericks in class is useful for the exam.    Writing lists of the "top ten things people are doing to stay awake... #1: re-enacting the Last Supper on their desks with animal crackers," however, does not appear to be helpful in reviewing for the test.

      Sorry for the stream of article links without any real law school content -- I'll have something to say about exam studying soon, I promise -- but here's  urlLink the Boston Globe magazine's cover story  about American Idol and the backstage lives of the contestants.  Not as interesting as NY Times plagiarizer Jayson Blair, but still a good read.  Especially for the Boston Globe.  :)    As far as that pesky task of exam studying goes, I've finally realized: (1) I take too many notes in class, (2) I take too few notes in the casebook, and (3) I really, really should start outlining sooner in the semester.  Coming soon: my advice on taking notes in class (that I ought to actually listen to).

      "Stressballs and Bagels"  On Monday at noon, I went to the student center and got a free highlighter and stress ball from Dorsey & Whitney LLP, which, I'm guessing, is a law firm whose name I should probably know by now.  Or perhaps I shouldn't know their name, and they know that, so they feel like they need to give me free things so I'll learn their name.  What bothers me is that it worked.  A few months from now, when I'm preparing my list of firms to bid for on-campus interviews with --  Digression: I don't like how they call the process "bidding" -- it's all about money with these people; there's not even any money involved in the process, yet still it has a money-associated name.  And it's not just the term "bidding."  They assign the interviews with a "lottery."  Another money word.  And if you don't like your interview times, you have to "change" them.  Yet another money word.  And employers look at the number of "credit"s on your transcript.  Will it ever end?  (as I was saying) -- I'm going to remember Dorsey & Whitney, but not remember that the only reason I remember them is because they gave me a free stress ball, and I'm going to check off their name as a place I really ought to be trying to get a job at.  They're buying me off with a stress ball.  But it works.  The other place I'm going to make sure I bid for an on-campus interview with is Finagle-A-Bagel, thanks to the bagel study break they sponsored on Monday night.  I spent fifteen minutes on line for a free bagel, which costs about a dollar.  That means I value my time at about four dollars an hour, which is actually good, because that's just about what I'd be making at Finagle-A-Bagel if I work there.  It's also what I'd probably end up making at a law firm, if you take into account that I'd probably try and bill forty hours a day.  But only work twenty-three.  Because I'm lazy.  I've practiced billing my hours this week, as I've been studying for exams.  Yesterday I billed two six-minute increments for "counting how many socks I have left until I have to do laundry."  I billed one six-minute increment for "flossing really thoroughly."  And I billed five six-minute increments for watching the American Idol weekly results show.  I just realized this afternoon that the American Idol finale will be the night before my Torts final.  Not good.  Not good at all.  Stresses me out just thinking about the conflict.  Good thing I have my Dorsey & Whitney LLP stress ball to help relieve the tension.  And my Dorsey & Whitney LLP heroin.  But Dorsey and Whitney LLP isn't my favorite law firm, even with the stress ball.  No, no, that honor belongs to Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP (what's up with the LLP at the end of all the names?  I know I should probably know what it means, because it's probably important... my best guess is something like Lucrative Limited Partnership, but I'm not even sure that I'm close here).    Stroock put a brochure in our mailboxes last semester telling us that all of the other firms lie to us and just tell us what we want to hear, and that being an associate is long hours, not a lot of fun, and pretty unpleasant overall -- but at least they're honest about it.  A few weeks ago, they followed that up with an advertisement filled with mysterious pictures of bees and captions that don't seem to be particularly related to the photos.  A picture of lots of bees -- "you will work at a highly-ranked and prestigious firm."  Okay, I understand -- they're illustrating the herd mentality here.  Gotcha.  A picture of one big bee and lots of little bees around it -- "you will work one-on-one with partners on real matters."  Again, I think I'm following.  Now it gets confusing.  One bee, all alone -- "you will find the collaborative nature of the environment rewarding and thrilling."  Collaborative nature, but only one bee... are they telling us that's a lie, and we're stuck in an office by ourselves the whole time?  I don't know.  Finally, close-up of one bee -- "you will never seem to leave the office but still find time for adequate sleep."  Does the bee look tired?  How can we tell what a tired bee looks like?  Are they trying to say we're all just interchangeable honeybees who'll never leave the office?  Are they saying they give out free honey?  Are they saying their office building looks like a hive?  I'm confused!  It gives me stress.  I need my stress ball.  If I worked for Stroock, I'd want to be the guy making the brochures instead of the one doing legal research.  That's probably not a good thing.  I'm also mildly allergic to bee stings.  So I probably shouldn't work there anyway.  And I'm mildly allergic to legal research.  So maybe this whole firm thing is a bad idea.  But at least I have a stress ball.   Excerpts from Dr. Seuss's recently-discovered unpublished manuscript, "Oh, the Law School Exams You'll Take."  One case is long The other is short This case is property That one is tort  Issues here, issues there Issues, issues everywhere Issues hidden on the sheet You won't find unless you cheat Issues on the front and back Issues that your outlines lack Issues that you won't remember Till you're a 1L, once more, in September  I know the statute Do you know it too? Do you think it would pass a judicial review? Do you think you can ponder the writer's intent? What the senator wanted, what the congressman meant? And the precedent cases I hoped that you'd find -- Even the ones that I didn't assign -- Do they cause any questions to pop in your head? If you wrote the opinion what would you have said? Would you remand the case or affirm it instead?  I is for issue, just give it a try R is for rule that the court should apply A, application, it counts for a ton C for conclusion -- and then you're all done!  Look at the outline your classmate has made Your feeble note cards won't be of much aid Should have been studying; instead you played But what does it matter, you'll get the same grade  One test, two test Have-no-clue test Three test, four test Please no more test Five test, six test Full-of-tricks test Seven test, eight test Hand-in-late test Nine test, ten test In-the-fall, all-again test.

      Just a quick comment on something in the news.  I was watching The Daily Show last night (my main source of world news, it seems), and Jon Stewart had a segment about Bill Bennett, former education secretary under President Bush the elder, and pretty much the spokesman for the "Americans should have good moral values" movement, as author of "The Book of Virtues," "The Moral Compass," a book about how President Clinton was a bad, bad man, and other such stuff.  Basically, he's been on a crusade to stop Americans from traveling down the road towards moral bankruptcy, or something like that.  And apparently -- and here's an  urlLink article  all about it -- he's a compulsive gambler who's lost over $8 million at Atlantic City and Las Vegas casinos.  It's this kind of stuff that makes people lose faith in humanity.  If you're going to preach to the country about values and morals, don't be a compulsive gambler.  It's really pretty simple.  I mean, he's not a murderer, or anything like that (although it seems from the photos of him that gluttony may also be an issue), but still....  Ridiculous.

      Thanks to  urlLink this weblog  of a soon-to-be-1L for linking to my post about the career services meeting last week.  His weblog's actually got an awfully helpful list of hints for writing resumes and cover letters.  I've had to read a bunch of resumes in the past as well, and he's right on pretty much all counts.  Follow directions, make things easy for the person reading it, show you care... easy stuff... probably works for law school exams too, actually.  Follow directions, make things easy for the professor, show you care... maybe I'll try and follow that advice when exams begin... in just 11 days.  And a new feature I'll introduce today, as I begin my studying... Things that have distracted me from studying today: the stress-ball and highlighter giveaway in the student center, buying a new container of milk, reloading my stapler, counting how many clean socks I have left so I can figure out when I need to do laundry next, reading a chapter of the baseball book I bought off Amazon last week (just in time to distract me from studying),  urlLink Rob Neyer's Big Book of Baseball Lineups , watching C-SPAN's streaming video of the Democratic Presidential Candidate Debate from this past weekend (more on that below), and seeing how many times I can tear a Post-It flag in half before the pieces get too small.    More on the Democratic Presidential Debate: 9 candidates.  It makes it look like a student council election when there are more people on stage than in the audience.  Let's see if I can name all 9 off the top of my head: Dennis Kucinich, Bob Graham, John Kerry, Joe Lieberman, Richard Gephardt, John Edwards, Al Sharpton, Carol Moseley Braun, and Howard Dean.  Or, in other words, Grumpy, Sleepy, Wealthy, Moral, Boring, Youthful, Crazy, Irrelevant, and Doc.  That entire joke was driven by the fact that Howard Dean is a doctor, and I thought that could be funny.  My thoughts on each of the 9, not that anyone cares:  Dennis Kucinich -- I really hadn't heard of him before watching the debate.  Apparently he was mayor of Cleveland, and under his watch, Cleveland went bankrupt.  His favorite line was "take the profit out of health care," which sounds to me like socialized medicine, and I'm not sure that works so well in countries where they have it.  He gave me no reason to even contemplate voting for him, even for President of the local school board.  Bob Graham -- A Senator from Florida, he got totally muddled when he was asked what he would do to make sure voting problems wouldn't happen there again.  Said something about it not being the federal government's job to make sure people can vote, it's the state's job.  A softball question, and he got sloppy and unclear with his answer.   John Kerry -- Seems qualified.  Didn't say much memorable.  His favorite thing to say was that he fought in Vietnam and is the only one up there who fought in Vietnam, and that means he's brave, and bravery is something the President needs.  Well, okay...  Joe Lieberman -- Best one-liner of the debate, in response to a question about electability.  Something like, "I'm confident I can beat George Bush... because Al Gore and I already did it once."  Funny.  I like Joe Lieberman.  He seems genuine, and he's moderate enough that I feel comfortable with his positions on most stuff.  Richard Gephardt -- Is really pale.  The other candidates didn't like his health care reform package.  I didn't pay close enough attention to know why.  John Edwards -- Seems younger than he is.  I don't really have anything objections to him, but he didn't say anything I remember.  Al Sharpton -- A Sharpton-Lieberman ticket would lose to the Natural Law Party.  Al Sharpton is entertaining to watch, and is probably as qualified to be President as Dennis Kucinich.  I'm not sure if his comment about making the right to vote and the right to health care part of our Constitution was an actual campaign platform, or just a spur-of-the-moment sounds-like-a-good-idea.  Carol Moseley Braun -- I read an article somewhere that she removed the hyphen from her last name to make it easier for voters.  Is this what our country has come to?  Apparently she was most recently Ambassador to some country that we're not at war with -- I can't remember, but I think she said New Zealand.  In any event, I recall thinking, "wow, that's not a job they give to people who are going to be President one day."  She also said she wants to focus on creating more spirituality in this country, or something to that effect.  My own personal biases, obviously, but I don't feel completely comfortable when anyone besides Lieberman says stuff like that, and can completely understand why lots of people wouldn't like Lieberman saying that either.  Howard Dean -- Is against the war, is a doctor, and needed to rehearse his closing statement more, because his eyes were darting back and forth between the paper in front of him and the camera every three seconds or so, and it was pretty distracting.  He claimed to be more liberal than the other candidates.  His answers didn't really distinguish him though.

      From an e-mail we just got:  "So are you in need of some highlighters or post-its???  What about a stress ball to help relieve the tension of Reading Period??? Well then come to [firm]'s promotional giveaway in the Hark on Monday, May 5th from 12PM  3PM - where you can pick up your free study aids and learn more about this great firm."  Are we that pathetic?  Are highlighters, post-its, and a stress ball all we need for a firm to buy our love and affection?

      Random advice: "I'm going to law school in the fall.  What can I do this summer to prepare?"  Sleep.  No, seriously.  Sleep, eat, see friends, do something fun.  It's your last summer without pressure to go work for a law firm, or something else similarly legal-sounding.  Try not to feel any pressure to learn any law or anything like that -- there are people here who started reading when they got their professor and textbook lists in August, who took pre-law preparation courses (Law Preview I think is the big one... it's done by the Princeton Review people, and, from what I hear, is a huge waste of $1000), who found jobs as paralegals thinking it would give them a head start... all seem pretty useless.  What I found slightly useful over the summer, just to give me a sense of what to expect, was reading some books about law school -- One L, by Scott Turow, is the famous Harvard memoir -- written about 25 years ago, and painting a picture of a law school world much more intense than it is now.  Some people say it scared them, but I thought it was an interesting read, and as long as you know it really isn't terribly representative of reality, I don't think it's too frightening.  I also read Law School Confidential and Planet Law School, two guidebooks to law school life -- Law School Confidential isn't bad, although it has a chapter about reading cases using six different colors of highlighters that I think is a pretty bad idea.  Come to think of it, if you head all the way back into the weblog archives, there's reviews of all these "pieces of literature" (and some other cool stuff, if I remember correctly) back last August.

      "It's Time For On-Campus Recruiting!  (Well, sort of...)"  Ah, the weather outside has finally started cooperating.  No more snow, lots of sun.  It's finally fall.  I mean spring.  Sorry about that.  I'm just a little confused, since the Office of Career Services has already started the fall recruiting process.  So it can't possibly still be spring.  That wouldn't make any sense.  I went to the OCS fall recruiting orientation kickoff meeting this past week. Couldn't tell if it was mandatory or not from the e-mail: "If you plan to participate in fall on-campus interviewing, please attend the orientation, or we will sabotage your bid lottery number, burn your resume, and make you work in Omaha."  Guess it's mandatory.  The career services representatives began the meeting by congratulating themselves at how lucky they are to have ended up working here and not at Thomas Cooley Law School.  Over 700 employers come here to interview students in the fall.  This is entirely because of the competence of our career services office and has nothing at all to do with the fact that this is Harvard.  Nothing.  It actually is a bit amazing that 700 employers come for probably a total of 500 students looking for jobs, and given that the biggest ones take a bunch each, a lot of these firms must be literally competing to even have a possibility of getting one student (and how lucky they would be...). It sort of sounds like the opposite of the college admissions process.  Lots of spots, limited number of students.  And, apparently, plenty of "financial aid" to go around.  But, unfortunately, no time for any extracurriculars.  They told us firms come from cities big and large, over 100 cities in all.  Big cities like New York, Washington, and Chicago, and "small cities like Philadelphia, Miami, Houston...." On what scale are Philadelphia and Houston small cities?  Oh, I forgot.  The Harvard Law School recruiting scale.  Philadelphia and Houston are small cities in the same way that $100,000 is a small starting salary, and 80 is a small number of billable hours per week.  Another small city they mentioned was Michigan.  I think it's somewhere in New Jersey.  Perhaps the students at Colombia Law School in South America have heard of it.  The real key to the meeting was finding out the list of things we must do over the summer.  Impossible to explain without an in-person meeting, the list includes updating our resume, lining up three references, ordering our transcript, developing a writing sample, and choosing which firms we want to bid on.  Whew, that was complicated.  But things may change - "be sure to check the OCS website throughout the summer," the handout says in bold letters, "for critical OCI updates."  Like this one I'm projecting to see sometime in the middle of July: "Attention, students.  All law firms in the universe have decided that resumes must be written in Greek.  Please update yours accordingly."  Or this one, from early August: "Transcripts now come in three flavors: cherry, honey-lemon, and traditional menthol.  Please check with your top firm choices to see which they prefer."  Or, the day after the end of the world: "Due to recent events, three of the seven hundred firms scheduled to come to campus have cancelled their visits.  For the six hundred and ninety-seven others, on-campus interviewing will proceed as normal, except that the interviews will be held somewhere in the atmosphere (to be announced), since the planet has vaporized.  Not even the end of the world can stop our graduates from securing high-paid employment upon graduation."  The big key to the recruiting process is research.  Research, research, research.  Gotta learn the difference between the cities and states (I know, I'm beating that one to death).  "It's hard to tell the difference between firms A, B, and C," they said.  "They tell you what you want to hear.  They'll all tell you can have a rewarding career as well as a life.  It's all marketing."  They really said that.  I took careful notes.  They told us about the hypothetical "Joe Bloggs," the worst-case-scenario icon of what happens when you don't do any research.  He misses the OCS orientation, logs onto the Vault list the last day of the bidding lottery and just picks the firms he's heard of, ends up with 8 callbacks, but realizes they all do corporate transactional work, while he wants to do litigation.  Worst-case-scenario, they tell us.  The homeless guy outside of CVS in Harvard Square is crying for you, Joe Bloggs.  "Corporate transactional work instead of litigation?"  "Only 8 callbacks?"  "How will you ever survive?"  You want an on-campus interviewing worst-case-scenario?  Here's one.  You submit your resume on time but OCS loses it, your lottery bid choices vanish into cyberspace, you end up interviewing only with firms in "small cities" like San Francisco, Tokyo, and Calcutta, your fortune cookie at the Chinese restaurant you eat in the night before your first interview reads "You Will Get SARS" (I've been waiting all column to make that line... without a doubt a current best-seller in the novelty fortune-cookie market... make a tiny bit of sense somewhere... anywhere...), and on the way to the Charles Hotel you fall into a well.  Although even in a coma, you can probably get a job with a firm in a small rural farming community like Nashville or Cleveland, so you're still probably good.  But that's certainly a more realistic "worst-case scenario."  My favorite part of the OCS orientation was the question-and-answer session.  "I'll take any questions you might have that you think might be relevant to the 500 other students in the room eyes glued to their watches and perched on the edges of their seats just waiting to escape."  "Yes, here's a quick question I'm sure everyone else wants to hear the answer to.  I, personally, me and only me, want to split my summer between a litigation firm in Atlanta and a greenhouse in the city of Canada.  I was wondering how the following seventeen firms on this list I've got in my pocket would feel about that, just off the top of your head.  Also, I'm lactose-intolerant."  Yes, general questions like that.  On the way out, they noted that we could find the handouts they'd given us on their web page, "which can be found in a number of different locations."  (I think I'll just look for it on the Law School web site, if that's okay.)  You mean we could've gotten the handouts without going to the meeting?  Really?  Thanks for the meeting, career services.  Good thing I went, since I'm sure there won't be any more in the fall.  Outtakes from OCS  I've somehow gotten my hands on a super-secret videotape of the OCS practice session, held the morning of the orientation meeting, where the staff members rehearsed their lines and did some last-minute preparation.  Some of the lines that didn't make it into the real meeting:  "Welcome to the OCS orientation session for fall recruiting 2007.  We're trying to get an early head start here..."  "Even though there are seven hundred firms, only a small handful of students in most years interview with all of them.  You may want to trim your list to only four or five hundred of your top choices."  "...or small cities like Shanghai, Mexico City, and Neptune."  "You might try this tactic for finding out the real truth about life at your top-choice firm: find an associate who looks somewhat similar to you.  Club him with a crow bar on his way out of the office one morning at four a.m., steal his access badge and brand-new suit, and go into work the next morning at six pretending to be him.  You'll get a first-hand look at the life of an associate, and be all the more prepared to do your bidding."  "While most of your resume should be in 10- or 12-point font, the word "Harvard" should appear in 64-point type, and preferably be accompanied by blinking Christmas tree lights."  "...appropriate references can be law school professors, former employers, or Saturday Night Live actor Chris Parnell, pretending to be President Bush calling Skadden on your behalf."  "You should choose 8 cities to visit for firm callbacks.  This will enable you to earn frequent flyer miles out the wazoo, and keep you well-rested for the interviews."  "If you would like OCS to review your resume... tough luck."  "It is critical that you check the OCS website frequently over the summer.  We get paid by the hit."  "Make sure your cover letters... aw, screw it.  I'm sick of this crap, year after year, watching these 24-year-old bastards getting jobs with a starting salary thirty-three times higher than the $8/hour Harvard pays us, without so much as lifting a finger.  Let's see if they can hack it if we cancel the interviewing process, refuse to release their transcripts, and spray the campus with a highly contagious fungus.  Then we'll see how smart they are.  That'll show them!"

      Got my course schedule for next year, after a ridiculously complicated three-round lottery that, in its most recent "general lottery" round recommended that we rank 31 different courses, in order to fill the 5 slots left after we got our "bundles" (Constitutional Law, Corporations, and Tax -- the 2L "recommended" courses -- not required, but in order not to take them, you must sign up for them in the bundle lottery, and then, after you've been scheduled into them, you must affirmatively drop them.  So it's opt-out, not opt-in for the bundles).  After carefully scrutinizing the lottery details they provided -- schedule timeslot blocks, maximum and minimum credits per semester and per year, limit of one seminar during pre-registration, 3L priority bumping, lists of traditionally oversubscribed courses -- I ranked my top 24 choices (just couldn't come up with a final 7), and ended up, happily, getting pretty much everything I wanted.  I'm 38th on the "priority wait list" for a seminar on Literature and the Law that I ranked first -- rising 3Ls get two full rounds before us, so it must have filled up then.  In fact, I talked to a rising 3L who ranked it first and didn't get it, so it filled up real fast -- but it's a class of 15, so the chances of 38 people adding and then dropping it is pretty slim.  Other than that, I got the classes I wanted: Bankruptcy (fall) and Secure Transactions (winter -- a 3-week mini-term where you take one class, for three hours every day), both with the awesome professor I had for contracts in the fall, Local Government Law (fall), a seminar on Behavioral Law and Economics (fall), and a class on Jewish law (spring).  My one-liner on that is that I'm taking it to meet a nice Jewish girl.  You think I'm kidding?  :)  Also yesterday: the Office of Career Services' Fall On-Campus Interviewing kickoff meeting, letting us know what we'll have to do over the summer to get ready for on-campus interviewing in September.  I think I've got 800 words in me to talk about that, so I'll save it for tomorrow.

      Part of me thinks I should write something about how last weeks Supreme Court decisions are especially important for law students, and how they affect us in ways above and beyond the normal population.  But after some thinking, I realize they dont.  The affirmative action one doesnt because Im already in school, and so its not really my business anymore how they choose the next generation of law students, right?  I mean, I won the admissions lottery, so that means its just fine the way it is.  (Thats my rationale for not supporting world hunger, too.  I mean, Im pretty full.  I had a big lunch.)  And the sodomy one doesnt affect any law students because all law students are studying too hard to think about ever doing any of that stuff anyway.    My grandmother actually asked me what I thought of the two decisions, given my one year of law school education.  I told her I thought they were both okay, but that I hadnt read the opinions or anything like that, so I didnt really have anything profound to say about them.  And even if I had read the opinions, the odds that I'd have anything profound to say were pretty slim.  Then she asked me what sodomy was.  So I told her what kind of stuff shed be allowed to do now, without getting arrested.  And then she said she doesnt like the kind of filth that law school is teaching me, and I should go learn to be a doctor instead.  I told her the Court said its legal for doctors to do that stuff now too.  Now shes afraid to go to the doctor.  And thats pretty much where I run out of material about the Supreme Court decisions.  So instead I figured Id write about July 4th.  Independence Day.  When we were kids it meant having a barbecue, watching the pretty fireworks, and taking great-aunt Sally to the hospital after she blew her finger off accidentally while lighting a Roman Candle.  For whatever reason, its funnier to me if I think of an elderly woman lighting fireworks in my joke than if I were to have said Uncle John.  Ill use Uncle John next time I make a joke about rape, though.  But as a law student, I think of Independence Day a little differently.  When I see fireworks, I think of defendants  the firework manufacturers, the stores that sell them, the police for not enforcing the anti-fireworks laws, the hospitals for being understaffed on holidays and not able to administer timely treatment, the insurance companies for denying legitimate claims built on the negligence of the fireworks makers, not on the negligence of great-aunt Sally, lighting the Roman Candle even though shes legally blind.  I think of the missing warnings on the packages, the missing safety features on the fireworks, and the missing digits on Sallys hand.  I think of contingency fees, and gruesome photos to gain the jurys sympathy, and contingency fees.  I think of money.  I think of lots of money.  And thats not all I think of.  I think of the barbecue grill manufacturers, the meat packing plants that dont test for salmonella, the failure of the meat thermometer to tell me when the chickens cooked all the way through, the failure of the city septic system to fully process what results from eating the infected meat, the poor image of great-aunt Sally, not really having a good evening, unable to share in the festivities of watching the neighbors house burn down after the fireworks land on his roof.  But I dont just think of lawsuits.  The mere words Independence Day remind me of my own independence.  The independence to work for whichever law firm will hire me.  The independence to pay off my loans on either the 10-year plan, the 15-year plan, or the 25-year plan.  The independence to choose from a wide array of courses, all of which Im guaranteed to get if my lottery number is low enough.  The independence to sit in whichever seat in the classroom I want to, as long as its the one Ive been randomly assigned by the assigned seat computer algorithm.  I also think of the laws that allow there to be liquor and fireworks stores on the side of the interstate in places like New Hampshire.  Live Free or Die, they say.  Yes, die of drunk driving, or of a fireworks mishap.  Good choices there.  How about getting drunk first, and then lighting fireworks?  That sounds like a recipe for a fun evening.  Finally, Independence Day makes me think of that Will Smith movie where they blew up the White House.  And that helps me sleep soundly at night.  So, a bit premature (but, hey, I just write what the muse tells me to...), have a happy July 4th.  And be careful with your fireworks.  But if youre not, I know some law students whod love to take your case.

      To the tune of Clay Aiken's "This Is The Night," here's "This Is The Firm"  [Bear in mind I'm not working for a firm this summer -- so this isn't about any specific firm, or anything like that...]  When I interviewed day and night I was dreaming to find the one Where could I go where a law firm could even be... fun? When sometime deep in the night I could even be done?  Work me hard, 'til I die Though I have no life there is nothing that I cannot buy I've been waiting forever for this This is the firm  When the answer to all my dreams Is just one Lexis search away I will be here till the day turns to night turns to day.  Work me hard, 'til I'm dead But at least my parents can say that I'm striving ahead Lose my friends, lose my mind But my loans are paid and there's no take-out food I can't find I've been waiting forever for this This is the firm  This is the firm where we spend our best years and we end up a shell of ourselves This is the firm where the work I'll do sends me to hell  Work me hard, kill my soul Make me realize that giant paychecks can make me feel whole Heart grows cold, mind grows numb But the choice is one that is safe and will not be called dumb I've been waiting forever for this This is the firm

      The first perk ever from having a weblog.  The author of a new book about law school,  urlLink Law School Insider , provided a special deal for law student webloggers like me: 2 books, basically for the cost of shipping plus a couple of dollars, on the condition that I give one away to someone who reads the weblog.  More details about how you can be the one I give it to -- at the bottom of the post.  First, I figure I owe it to the author to post something about the book (I assume the reason for the deal is to get the little bit of publicity that a weblog can provide), and I owe it to anyone who might want to buy the book to provide a bit of a review.  So...  Book Review: Law School Insider  Before I begin, a caveat -- I thought the book was okay.  I'm really hard to please with this stuff.  If you read my review without knowing I thought the book was okay, it probably sounds like I hated it.  I didn't.  There were things I thought could have been better.  I've pointed those out.  But it's not a bad book, it's not a waste of your time to read it, and I think it's probably as useful as any other book that's out there.  So take my comments as criticism, but couched in the understanding that this is not a bad book.    The first thing you should know about this book is that it has a lot of words.  It's 338 pages of content (plus 50 pages of appendix plus index), but on top of that, each page is really dense with text.  This book uses the smallest typeface and the least amount of space between lines as any book I've ever seen.  The footnotes look like they're probably 8 point text at most.  This is a big, big book.  And, if nothing else, with all of those words, it's pretty comprehensive.  It really does cover topics from deciding whether to go to law school to the bar exam, and everything in between.  If it happens at law school, it's probably mentioned somewhere in the book.  Probably more than once.  And probably in a lot of words.  The book seems to be trying to be two things at once.  It's trying to be a guide to law school life, but at the same time, it's basically a really detailed summary of the author's law school experiences.  After reading the book, you know about virtually all of his professors, his classes, his dating life, his study habits, his vacations, his summer jobs (in tremendous detail), his journal elections (in excruciating detail), and his bar exam class -- and that list is without looking back at the book.  And some of it is absolutely universal, and interesting and useful to read.  But some of it is unnecessary, like when a friend tells you all about an episode of a television program you've never seen and have no real interest in watching.    The good thing about the abundance of detail is that it does provide a picture of what certain aspects of law school life are like for certain people -- although if you don't go to a school where journal selection happens like it does at Cornell (his school), and if you don't go to a school that does recruiting like it happens at Cornell, and if you don't spend a summer split between Cleveland and Irvine, CA like he does, and if you don't have a set of course options like he does at Cornell... then it's less applicable to you.    The frustrating thing about the abundance of detail (for me) was that while stories about life at law school can be entertaining, can be funny, can be enjoyable to read -- I hope my weblog illustrates that, at least sometimes -- his writing isn't particularly witty or amusing.  The writing's clear, easy to read, gramatically correct, and all of that... but it doesn't have a spark that grabbed me as a reader and helped me to overlook the abundance of detail, or to actually want to keep reading even when I knew this was just a story and not a piece of information that would be truly helpful.  If you're looking for an *entertaining* read, this isn't the right book.  It's a fine book for information and detail, but it's not going to make you laugh out loud.  One exception was a set of haikus about rejection letters from firms which was amusing, fun to read, and, honestly, felt a little out of place given the tone of the rest of the book.  It may be that after a year of law school, I know about most of what he's talking about, and so I didn't find the book as rewarding as I might have if I read it before law school.  If I'd read it before law school, though, it probably would have frightened me a bit.  The author worked really hard in school, and paints a picture of 1L life as absolutely wall-to-wall studying, with sleepless nights, hardly any time for extracurricular activities, and a life-altering boot camp experience.  Like I've written before, I just don't think it has to be that way, and my experience has told me that for most people, it isn't that way.  Most people I know got more than the 4-5 hours of sleep a night he says was normal, and if they were getting only that much sleep it was because they were going out every night.  He asserts that more than one extracurricular activity is probably too much to bite off.  I think that's wrong.  He talks about it being impossible to enjoy law school without having a tremendous amount of passion and diligence -- and of course both of those things help, but I think sleep and time-management skills may be two more important things to be worried about.   ...keep reading below...

      Because the author is trying to do two things at once -- share his own experiences and provide universal advice -- I think he overstates how widespread his experiences are.  He's really skeptical of professors writing recommendation letters in time for deadlines, and I'm not sure that's a universal problem.  He recommends Kaplan test prep because it worked for him.  He talks about studying at a level he never had to before.  He talks about his summer law firm treating him impersonally.  He talks about the frustrations with course registration and with who Cornell gaves tenure too.  All things that may not apply to everyone, everywhere.  No question, there are also some great parts of the book -- a crisp, clear description of gunners, of the Socratic method and its plusses and minuses, of how to judge a summer experience, of what's involved in Law Review, of how worried people get about the bar exam.  And some of his stories are interesting -- about cheating on exams, about dating at law school, parts of his description of journal elections.  If you're going to Cornell, I'd say this is probably a must-read.  You'll get a lot out of it.  If you're not going to Cornell, I'd say there's nothing wrong with this book -- it's certainly comprehensive, it's not a bad read, it's got some advice... although, I honestly liked Law School Confidential better.  Because it incorporated lots of people's experiences, it didn't get bogged down in the idiosyncracies of one person's life, and I also thought its advice was clearer, better, and more universal.  If you're reading law school weblogs, you're probably going to read both of the books anyway, regardless of what I say.    Take his experiences for what they are -- I don't think they're as universal as he paints them.  And don't let the book scare you into not doing as many activities as you think you'd like to, and as you think will make you happy.  And get more than 4-5 hours of sleep a night, Really.  Okay -- how you can get my extra copy.  I want to make this fair and not just give it to someone I know -- because I can just let them borrow the copy I get to keep if I know them.  So I'll give this until end of day Monday so as not to disadvantage people who only surf the web during the week.  Send me an  urlLink e-mail  telling me you want the book.  If anyone has a reason that's really super-compelling, I'll give them the book.  If not, I'll put all the names into a hat and pick one.  You pay nothing -- I'll spring for shipping, whatever it is.  Hope this was useful.

      A couple of weeks ago, I wrote a bit about an ad I saw on the subway for a law firm with a Fighting Irish Leprechaun as its mascot.  I don't think I beat the subject to death enough in that post, so here's more on Seamus.  If you read that other post, the first 30% of this or so will look mostly (but not entirely) familiar.  But the rest , I assure you, is brand new from the dark corners of my mind...  "Seamus, The Fighting Irish Leprechaun"  Throughout the New York City subway system (slogan: were cleaner than the New York City sewer system, sometimes), theres an advertisement I often see for a certain law firm.  I wont name them again (you'll have to scroll down about 2 weeks for that), just in case I end up working for them.  The ad lists a bunch of cases theyve won regarding lead poisoning, hospital errors, and other highly-respected tort issues (not included, but probably coming soon: supermarket slip-and-fall, the rare-but-dangerous asbestos-fried chicken incident at an Applebees in Detroit (yes, Im making that up), and alien abduction), along with huge dollar figures (that look even huger when expressed in pesetas or lira).  And a slogan, in quotes: We fight for kids with brain damage.  (As opposed to we fight against kids without brain damage, but our powerful blows to the head give them brain damage) The ad includes a silhouette of a man with a top hat and boxing gloves  fight[ing], I suppose, for kids with brain damage.  And it gets better.  On their web site (yes, I made it a point to remember the address so I could check it out when I got to work  it was not, as one might guess, www.Ivefallen,Icantgetup,andIneedsomeonetosue.com), they explain the top hat / boxing glove man:   Were proud of being known as fighters for our clients rights, and the [firms] fighting spirit is embodied in our logo and our mascot, Seamus, our Fighting Irish Leprechaun.  Seamus, the Fighting Irish Leprechaun.  Could I make this up?  Does this really help them get clients?    Hello, law firm?  Im on the floor of the subway after being left there by aliens, and I saw your ad.  I know you must be a reputable firm because youve got a fighting Irish leprechaun named Seamus.  And leprechauns, of course, are known for their great client advocacy skills and mastery of the complicated details of tort law.  I also think youre a reputable firm because you advertise on the subway.  Like with those magic brain enlargement pills I took a few weeks ago (before my lead poisoning caused it to shrink back to its normal size), Ive learned that businesses that advertise on the subway are often best in their class.  But its actually a bait-and-switch tactic.  At the first client meeting:  Wait a minute, Mr. OLeary.  Im sure youre a wonderful attorney  the law degree from the University of Phoenix Online notwithstanding, but I thought Seamus the Fighting Leprechaun was going to be my attorney.  Thats who I signed up for.  You mean Seamus isnt actually a lawyer?  Not actually a real person?  What are you talking about?  Hes your mascot.  And he fights for kids with brain damage.  My kid has brain damage!  Not from any specific incident, just from my genetic pool, but still  I wanted Seamus!  Fortunately, they keep a leprechaun costume in the back closet, and can have first-year associates pretend to be Seamus at a moments notice, popping into client meetings and ensuring that the lawyer assigned to each case has Seamuss seal of approval  a four-leaf clover, if Im not mistaken.  Oh, Seamus, thank goodness youre here today.  I know you must be very busy fighting for kids with brain damage.  But Mr. OLeary said you didnt really exist, and that you couldnt be my lawyer.  Dont worry, maam.  Thats just Mr. OLearys brain damage talking.  Every so often he loses his grip on reality and thinks Im an imaginary character.  But well get him back on the psychotropic drugs, and hell be just fine at trial.  You know, Mr. OLeary is one of our best attorneys.  He actually almost passed the bar exam!  Thanks, Seamus!  I knew I could count on you to fight for me.  Now that I know Mr. OLeary is usually mentally competent, Im confident that you guys can help me win my case against the people of the third moon of Neptune.  Thats what Im here for.  Now Im off to a special business lunch with Guido the Fighting Mobster, Ugubu the Fighting Marathon Runner, and Shlomo the Fighting Rabbi.  Weve got an animated series coming to UPN in the fall and weve got to go find a script writer.  I think Aaron Sorkin may be interested.  I used to watch the West Wing.  But they talk too fast.  Mr. OLeary doesnt talk too fast.  No.  Like I said, Mr. OLeary has brain damage.  And he went to the University of Phoenix Online law school.  Those two things are not merely a random coincidence.  Have fun at lunch, Seamus.  Thanks.  Enjoy the rest of your pre-trial meeting.  I think this is why people make lawyer jokes, and probably why lawyers suffer from higher rates of depression than people in virtually any other profession.  After all, I cant think of anything more depressing than being someones distant second choice for a lawyer, after a Fighting Leprechaun.  Except perhaps being their third choice, after a Fighting Leprechaun, and a Complete Moron.  The mascot of another law firm that advertises on the subway, actually.  Its Mikey the Complete Moron, fighting for people who cant afford a lawyer with a variety of form contracts he found lying in a puddle outside Grand Central Station and a diploma from Yail University Law Schoool he bought on the Internet.  But at least he saved the tuition money.

      Thanks to JCA at  urlLink Sua Sponte  for her awfully nice response to my response to her post about law school advice (below).    She writes, "never, never underestimate the force of law school culture. Pay attention to culture when you're choosing a law school. It's every bit as important as the professors' pedigrees, if not more so..."    I definitely agree in principle -- I just wonder (a) if it's really possible to tell anything about the "culture" of a law school before you're a student, and (b) what exactly "law school culture" means -- I guess there must be schools that on the whole are more competitive than others, or have more or less of a feeling of community, or have friendlier / more social / more relaxed people... but I think a lot of it is determined by the person.  I'd think that just about any law school (or undergrad, or job, or life...) can be either wonderful or horrible depending on what you make of it.  There are people in my class who are miserable, there are people who are in heaven... it's not the school's fault for the former or to its credit for the latter... it's that people have either found or not found what works for them within the school... and I guess some schools do fit people better or worse... but, going back to (a), I think that's probably really hard to know before you're there.  Heck, even after a year I have no idea what Harvard's "culture" is, and how it really compares to anywhere else in terms of lifestyle.  What vague advice I seem to have just provided...

      JCA, over at  urlLink Sua Sponte  offers a summary of advice by bloggers about a bunch of different aspects of law school, along with her thoughts.  It's an interesting post.  Just thought I'd piggyback on it, and offer my thoughts on some of the categories of advice she lists that I haven't expounded on before.  1. Doing what other people tell you  I agree with what seems to be the prevailing wisdom here -- obviously some advice works for some people, other advice works for other people, and you probably just need to figure out what works for you.  I have nothing profound to say here, except that at law school more than during undergrad -- probably because everyone was taking the same classes, so it was easier to compare tactics and discuss study strategies -- I've realized that different people really do learn differently, process information differently, have tricks and tactics that work for them, but may not work for others.  Just like people prefer different professors and different subjects.  I'm amazed that the people who don't take notes in class (there are a few) can retain all of the information the professor says in class.  But I bet they're amazed that people who are typing virtually a transcript of the class are listening well enough to really understand and comprehend the material at all.  So we're all different, I guess.  2. Talking in class  Again, I think everyone's different.  But for the people who want to talk in class -- who really, really want to talk in class -- I'd actually urge them to lay back a bit at the very beginning and let other people talk.  I'm just inventing thoughts on the fly here, so this may not make any sense.  I haven't really thought this through.  But, potential talkers, just watch and see how people are reacting in the first day or two of class to the people who are talking a lot.  See how you're reacting.  Are you thinking, "oh, wow, she's really smart; I'm glad she keeps raising her hand; she has interesting points to make," or are you thinking, "oh no, not him again."  See how it feels not to be a talker.  And then ask yourself, "do I really want to be one of them?"  And if you do, then go for it.  As long as you kind of understand that some people's reactions to some people who talk a lot in class are going to be negative.  I think some people are just gifted with the ability to be engaging, to seem humble and polite yet intelligent, and to be people who students like to hear talk, and appreciate their insights.  And some people, even though it's not their intent, come off as a little bit full of themselves.  I don't know if it's real, or just something in how they're talking that makes them seem different than they really are.  All this is to say talk if you want to talk, but recognize some people might form an impression of you that may or may not be true.  Unless you're one of the gifted ones, in which case you should talk all you want, because I'd rather listen to you than be called on myself.  3. Balancing school and life  I think I've beaten this one to death throughout the archives.  There are activities you can do that have nothing to do with school.  If you're not happy with your school-life balance, it's your own fault and you can do something about it.  Don't make yourself insane.  That's all the advice I have there.  4. Urban legends about law school  I read One L.  I recognized it for what it was -- one guy's successful battle to have a miserable time at law school.  Read it for an illustration of everything you don't need to do unless you want to be sad.  5. Metamorphosis  JCA writes, eloquently: "It's hard to invest so much of your time and energy into an experience designed to change you as a person without it having some effect on your identity. There are people, it seems, who can manage this, people who can cleanly maintain their law-school self and their external self in parallel. This skill is as mythical to me as shyness, or mathematical brilliance, or the ability not to take oneself seriously: all features that other people have, or claim to, with which I have no firsthand experience."  But I'm just not sharing JCA's sentiments here, at all.  I don't think law school is, or at least needs to be, "designed to change you as a person."  It's school.  It's teaching you stuff.  Some knowledge, some skills.  It's school.  Not POW camp.  If law school is making you become someone who you don't like, or who isn't really you anymore, you're taking it too seriously.  Way too seriously.  I met with someone at the office of student life counseling at one point during the school year -- to get summer job leads, after being referred there by career services (see the sketch from a couple of weeks ago about career services; it's fact, not fiction) -- and the guy I met with was concerned because I seemed to be "observing" law school as opposed to being "immersed" in law school.  I guess this is the distinction JCA is talking about, but I'm really not convinced that I'm on the incorrect side of that line.  Even for someone who wants to be a lawyer -- you don't actually want to *be* a lawyer as your exclusive identity, do you?  You're a person, with lots of other characteristics and traits, who happens to have a law degree, and practices law... I hope?

      A pretty random sketch, sort of about affirmative action, but really just me trying to be funny.  I'm working on a better ending.  Black and White Cookie  (BAKER is behind the counter at a bakery, carefully setting out his black-and-white cookies.  He sings a little tune.)  BAKER (singing) Black and white cookies are nice and sweet Make for a fine dessert time treat All the men and women they love to eat My secret ingredients a half a pound of meat...  (CUSTOMER walks in)  CUSTOMER Good morning, Mr. Baker.  BAKER Good morning, hungry-looking sir.  CUSTOMER You know, I was just thinking the other day what a fine coincidence it is that your last name is Baker, and you happen to be a baker.  BAKER Thats no coincidence, sir.  I changed my name.  My last name used to be Cleans the Sewer.  CUSTOMER How pleasant.  BAKER But enough about me and how I didn't wash my hands before I baked these cookies.  How can I help you?  CUSTOMER Id like a black and white cookie, please.  BAKER Excellent choice.  Since theyre the only things I have.  Here you go.  (he hands Customer a cookie)  CUSTOMER (he gasps in shock)  Mr. Baker, this cookie is at least 90 percent white.  Theres hardly any black at all on here.  BAKER Really?  CUSTOMER Really.  Take a look.  (Baker takes a look.)  BAKER Wow.  Youre right.  I hadnt realized that.  CUSTOMER Dont you use a ruler, or measure out the frosting, or some other way to ensure an equal mix of black and white?  BAKER No can do.  The Supreme Cookie Court outlawed quotas.  In an opinion written by Justice Candy.  CUSTOMER I think you mean Justice Kennedy.  BAKER Perhaps.  In any event, I cant have a set amount of black and white frosting in mind when I start.  I cant have a target Im trying to meet, or any kind of system aimed at ensuring equality.  I just need to wing it, and kind of try to make sure theres a decent mix of the two.  But no quotas.  CUSTOMER But I like the black side better, and theres hardly any black on my cookie.  BAKER Thats not my fault, sir.  I dont make the rules, I just make the cookies.  I dont know why you dont like the white frosting.  Its without question the most qualified frosting there can be on a cookie of this type.  It passed the quality inspection with flying colors, mostly white, which I guess isnt really a color... but anyway, it comes from very stable parents  flour and sugar, very well respected in the baking community  and its really well-positioned to flow through your digestive system smoothly and end up in the sewer without incident.  And I know the sewer system quite well from my last job, before I changed my name.  CUSTOMER Thats all well and good, but I like the black side better.  I want more of it.  BAKER No one told you to come to my bakery, sir.  This is an elite institution.  Ive baked for David Duke.  You could have gone to the co-op down the street, or just gotten an apple pie at Burger King.  Or bought some cookies from the unaccredited store on the Internet.  I hear theyre getting very popular.  But if you want to buy a cookie from my bakery, you need to realize that the frosting has certain standards it needs to meet.  CUSTOMER But the black frosting tastes so sweet...  BAKER Thats ridiculous.  Its the same ingredients.  Youre imagining things.  CUSTOMER But if it's the same ingredients... why are they different colors?  BAKER What am I, a scientist?  I'm just a baker.  Take your perplexing questions elsewhere.  I don't make sense, I just make cookies.  (CUSTOMER 2 enters.)  BAKER May I help you?  CUSTOMER 2 Yes, Id like to place an order for some dark pumpernickel bread.  CUSTOMER 1 You gonna give him white bread instead, Mr. Baker?  BAKER No, you ignorant fool.  Everyone knows the Supreme Cookie Court has absolutely no jurisdiction over bread.   Bread's covered by a statute.  (blackout.)

      You're probably looking for the affirmative action stuff below.  Have fun.  But, in case you've already read that, what I was actually going to post before I noticed Mitch over at  urlLink Yale Pundits  had given me something to respond to was something I've noticed about the NYC Subway that bothers me.  People don't give up their seats for old people.  It's ridiculous.  Elderly people -- or younger-than-that women carrying packages, or babies, or even yet-to-be-born babies -- get on the packed subway, and able-bodied young people don't bat an eyelash.  It's ridiculous, and should be a crime and prosecuted as such.  I love sitting as much as the next guy -- maybe even more, because of my irrational fear of touching the metal poles unless I absolutely must -- but if someone who looks, say, over 55 gets on the train, or a woman of any age who doesn't look like she's more fit than me -- I stand up and give up my seat.  And I'm continually shocked that no one else does this.  It's selfish, impolite, and really an unpleasant statement about society, I think.  Buses too.    What's not quite as bad but still pretty bad?  Half the time, if I give up my seat the person doesn't even say thank you.  That's not as offensive, but still kind of rude.

      Mitch Webber, over at the very thorough and truly impressive  urlLink Yale Pundits  weblog -- I'm saying it's impressive because somehow Mitch has the energy to consistently comment intelligently on virtually every topical issue in the news, while I can barely read the New York Times sports section without drifting off to go watch some mind-numbing reality television -- has a relatively severe, but very well-expressed and certainly thought-provoking, reaction to my thoughts on affirmative action (below).  Mitch says affirmative action isn't fair to people who are better qualified and get denied a space in a specific university that they've earned through their academic performance and hard work, and that we ought to expect the same performance from everyone, and that eventually people from every group will be able to perform up to that standard and Harvard Yard will look like a cross-section of America.  Mitch is probably going to hate that I threw the word "eventually" in there, because he didn't write it, yet it's what I'm going to react to.  But he kind of wrote it: "Diversity will come... [R]epresentatives from every ethnic group will perform... It may take a while for Harvard Yard to look like a cross section of American -- it may never quite make it -- but at least the diversity in a world without affirmative action would be meaningful..."  But I think we have to look why it isn't here now.  Why don't we have diversity now if we eliminate affirmative action?  Mitch gives some of the credit to culture differences, and that may be fair.  He says that Jews and Asians put more of an emphasis on education.  I'm not going to say I necessarily agree or disagree with him, but intuituively I can't help but think that if certain groups are placing more of an emphasis on education, it may be because it's harder to focus on education when you're worried about where your next meal is coming from.  Demographically, a larger percentage of some groups live in poverty, and maybe just can't worry as much about homework when they need to worry about the phone bill.  And I know it's all interrelated -- worry more about education and maybe not as much poverty, but given poverty how can you worry about education.  I have no data and no conclusions I'm trying to make.  Just saying it may not be as straightforward as just saying it's culture differences.  So if it's not culture differences, it's something else.  Socioeconomic status, quality of education, access to books, parents with college degrees... can be all sorts of things, and most of these things tend to fall to some degree on certain demographic groups more than others.  So as a society, we ought to be trying to address those problems.  I don't know that everyone is playing on the same field.  And if the playing field isn't level, it's not fair to expect the same academic performance out of everybody.  So we might need something that helps find the most talented people in every group when the numbers may not be really indicative of everything.  I don't like affirmative action.  In a perfect world, obviously we wouldn't need it.  But given the unequal playing field, it's hard for me to say we don't need it.  And in part because a university's mission isn't necessarily to train those students with the highest SAT scores.  If we don't do something to increase diversity, we're perpetuating the problem -- we'll continue to have an elite that's not very diverse.  It doesn't help address the underlying inequalities if we perpetuate this lack of diversity.  Affirmative action done in a good way should help to eliminate the need for itself -- in theory.  I would hope.  I would strive for.  Otherwise it's kind of pointless.  I realize I'm rambling.  Mitch did a better job than I am of making his post organized and coherent.  But I'm not done yet.  Mitch says: "And what about those who are harmed by affirmative action? You know, the students perhaps better qualified to sit in the classroom than those who were aided by affirmative action? ...Admissions is largely arbitrary. He -- and we -- got lucky. Many others just like us don't get so lucky. The least we can do is to try and make the system a little less arbitrary, a little more predictable and fair."  I'm going to seize on "many others just like us don't get so lucky."  Who's luckier?  The brilliant kid who went to prep school and, despite taking a Kaplan course, still aced his SAT (pardon the unnecessary jab at SAT prep courses), gets rejected at Harvard perhaps due in part to affirmative action and ends up at Penn.  Or the equally brilliant kid who grows up in the projects, can't afford the prep school or the Kaplan course, doesn't ace his SAT, and, in our world without affirmative action, ends up at McDonalds because he can't get in anywhere.  Suppose both of these kids are equally brilliant.  Both can thrive at the top universities -- probably kid A gets better grades because he's better prepared, probably kid B struggles.  But they're both smart, and neither one is a poor addition to any sort of elite group of well-educated people this society may have.  If the choice is making kid A go to Penn instead of Harvard, or kid B go to McDonalds instead of Harvard, I choose to help kid B.  Yeah, I'm oversimplifying, and yeah, it sucks for kid A.  It sucks big time.  But he's gonna get into a fine school with or without affirmative action, and have a great chance to do great things in life.  Why isn't it fair to make sure kid B has that chance too?  I know Mitch can probably tear this argument apart with his keyboard tied behind his back, but I'm making it anyway.  At midnight.  Without reading it over.  Because I'm a risk taker.  Ha. [edited to add: I know I'm just being sloppy here.  I know it's often not the Kid Bs who are helped, but the Kid As who just happen to be of a certain race or ethnic group -- and that may be a problem with affirmative action as practiced, I don't know that it means the whole thing is useless.  Emphasizing "I don't know."]  My favorite part of Mitch's post: "Any good Jewish mother would by dying to marry her daughter off to Jeremy."  Well, Jewish mothers reading my weblog, if you're out there...  P.S. Mitch writes: "Jeremy, despite his guarded political stances, reveals today what I'd consider a typical Ivy League response to the decision."  I hope that's not really true.  It may just be that my education has shifted me farther along the political spectrum than I realize, but I don't really consider myself a typical Ivy League liberal, if there is such a thing.  I like to believe that I'm much more moderate than that, and even, on a lot of issues, fairly conservative.  It may be that my views on affirmative action are more liberal than I realize.  But it certainly wasn't my intention to parrot the liberal party line, or anything like that, and if I've come closer to doing that than I thought I was, then maybe I'm just wrong about thinking I'm fairly middle-of-the-road...

      Given the Supreme Court's ruling today on affirmative action -- from my reading of this  urlLink New York Times article  seems like they're saying some sort of preference on the basis of race is okay, but specific quotas or point systems are not -- I feel like I ought to write something on the subject.  From a legal point of view, I have no idea.  I was in a lunchtime conversation one day at law school where people made constitutional arguments on both sides -- I think I was more focused on counting the tiles on the ceiling.  So, as a law student, I speak with no authority at all on the legality of this stuff.    But from a practical perspective -- I like the Supreme Court's middle-ground approach.  Diversity is good.  Absolutely.  It makes school better.  Being exposed to people of different cultures, of different races -- all good stuff.  Helps society to have top schools reflect the nation's population to some degree because if many of the future important people come from top schools, and we want the mix of important people to reflect the mix in society, this is good.  Does anybody argue against this?  That, in and of itself, given the choice of diversity or no diversity, all else being equal, that diversity isn't preferable?  I'm going to assume that even if that's not a universal sentiment, it's reasonable enough.  There is value in university students who've, say, never met a Protestant, and whose family thinks that Protestants all have three legs, meeting some Protestants and seeing they're just as smart and civilized and friendly as they are.  But quotas and "bonus points" and stuff like that make people freak out.  I read an analogy once that has stuck with me -- people overestimate the negative effects of affirmative action like they overestimate the impact of handicapped parking spaces.  Only one person can fit in that space, but every car driving around the parking lot thinks "if only that spot wasn't reserved for the handicapped, I could park there," when really only one of them could.  And, yeah, it's kind of icky when someone in an overrepresented group who scores a 1610 on his SAT, wins the Nobel Prize, and has a 5.2 GPA gets rejected in favor of someone in an underrepresented group who scored a 380 on his SAT and has a 0.02 GPA.  But when admissions committees look favorably upon extracurricular participation, situations where students have overcome hardship, good reference letters, or sports stardom, people don't complain so much.  And when they look at legacies, or, for some schools (that aren't need-blind), ability-to-pay, people complain, but not so much as to file lawsuits (or do they?  I just may not know of them.)  So it seems like treating diversity as another category to strive for -- we want a mix of artistic people, sports people, math people, and diverse people... -- isn't so awful, and is pretty much this middle ground that the Supreme Court is trying to find.    I realize I've failed to be particularly informative or controversial here, but pretty much only served to give my relatively uninformed opinion about why I think the Supreme Court is doing okay here, and why I think some sort of affirmative action is good, but quotas and rigid stuff like that is bad.  I can see both sides.  It's not fair to underrepresented groups who may not, on the aggregate given demographic realities, get the same kinds of opportunities in terms of elementary schooling and advanced placement classes and, because of past discrimination, have the same kinds of networks and connections to people in society's power elite.  And so affirmative action in principle can do a good job of compensating for some of these things, and making opportunities available to people who might otherwise not need the help affirmative action provides, but for the demographic realities.  And I understand the other side, that says it's not fair to give advantages (a) to individuals who haven't necessarily been disadvantaged, and (b) on a basis that undercuts the idea of a meritocracy and people being judged on demonstrated performance and potential, not on aggregate demographics and the injustices of past generations.  This is no doubt an oversimplification of both sides of the argument, but hopefully does an equally incomplete job of stating each side, no one can get mad at me.  I'm going to read the actual Supreme Court opinions tonight, and probably realize I have no idea what I'm talking about.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  writes about telling people that he goes to Harvard and how he avoides saying it, telling people instead that his school is "near Boston," and when he's finally forced to say "Harvard," it ends conversations.  Normally, I agree with much of what Waddling Thunder has to say.  But I can't help but wonder if what's turning people away isn't that he finally says "Harvard," but that they see that he's going through pains to avoid it.  By saying stuff like "it's near Boston," or "it starts with the letter after G," or "the school that Bob Clark was dean of until he retired," and avoiding just answering the question with a straight answer, it becomes an unnecessarily big deal.  It's just a school.  It's not a big deal. Who cares.  Yes, it's a good school.  And, yes, it probably means that I did slightly better on my LSAT or had slightly higher grades in college than someone who goes to an unaccredited law school in Guam somewhere.  And, clearly, both of those are measures of someone's worth, inner goodness, and value to society.  It's just a school.  I'm glad I go there, I'm lucky and fortunate to have gotten in, but it doesn't make be a better person, a smarter person, a more interesting person, or a taller person.  It does make me a poorer person, for now.  And, in the winter, a colder person.  But if someone acts like it's a big deal -- ooh, I can't say the H-word because it'll scare people away -- then it becomes a big deal.  If you just say it and move on -- "yeah, it's a good school, I like it there, but I'm sure the education and the students aren't really that different from at any number of schools" -- then I can't imagine why it would make people walk away and stop a conversation.  I'm not being fair to my colleague.  He says this behavior is particular to lawyers, and, now that I think about, besides in the one in-person job interview I had (the rest were over the phone), I don't think I've met a single lawyer since I started law school.  And job interviews ought not count anyway, since they know where I go to school.  They have my resume.  So maybe when I start doing lawyerly things and meeting lawyerly people, my reaction will be different and I'll concur with Waddling Thunder's observation.  I have no way of knowing at this point.  But my hunch is that it just doesn't have to be a big deal.

      Welcome to the Bar  Did I hear you right?  Did you just say that your bar review course isnt actually taught by a real person, but that you have to go to a room at a certain time for 6 hours a day, and watch a video?  On a little TV?  And take pages and pages of notes?  Are you serious?  Uh... yeah...  And that it costs you  or not you, your firm, whoever  twenty-five hundred dollars for you to watch these videos?  And you cant get a copy if you miss a class?  And theres no one to answer any questions?  And you cant get that last sentence played back, even if the tape skips?  Uh... yeah...  And no ones come up with the book version for, say, a hundred bucks, that you can just study on your own from, at your own pace, in your own living room, without having to trudge to class every day?  Uh... no...?  I thought my friend was lying to me.  I really did.  As Ashton Kutcher would say, I thought I was being Punkd.  Bar review courses are on video?  All that money for a video?  All those hours watching a video?  6 hours a day of law video?  I cant even concentrate for an entire episode of Elimidate, and Bar-Bri (or its competitors) will expect me to concentrate for the equivalent of a 12-episode Real World marathon all about evidence?  And then go home and study this stuff?  Are they nuts?  I know its too early to be thinking about the bar  its only nine in the morning! (ha ha ha) But I think theres a broader lesson to be learned. They can do this  charge a gazillion dollars for nothing more than a video series on the law  because theyve got us trapped (or, as Ashton Kutcher would say, Trappd).  No one would dare not take a bar review course, just like no one would dare not join a journal, and no one would dare boycott the bookstore because they give us three cents on the dollar for used casebooks, and no one would dare complain about bad professors, and no one would dare picket the cafeteria when the meat gets up and walks off our trays under its own volition.  Were conformists  thats how we got to law school.  The rebels dropped out in fifth grade and have never looked back.  We accepted that paste is not for eating, and its been downhill from there.  An employer tells us to find the legal rules about employee torture, and we dont ask why a company ought to be allowed to rip its workers toes off one by one as long as its done in a safe and sanitary way by machines operated by union members.  We just write a memo about it.  We dont ask why it takes longer to grade our exams than it would take to drive all the way around the equator in a Nissan Sentra.  We dont ask why some professors are great and some just arent. We just accept it.  But I dont want to accept it anymore.  I dont want to accept that law school graduates work at law firms and the work sucks but the moneys good. And I dont want to accept that bar review courses are taught on video.  Imagine if professors just sent a video in with their lectures.  Forget even showing up.  And then students could send a video of themselves listening. The good news would be no more socratic method, no more cold-calling, no more solitaire.  The bad news would be no more classes, no more school, no more learning.  Lock in your Bar-Bri price now, because you know once they switch over the DVD theyre going to have to raise the price.  And laser discs?  Forget about it.  Wed all be screwed.  Or, as Ashton Kutcher would say, Screwd.

      Some things you'll rarely hear in law school:  "And then the two sides just agreed to disagree" "I don't really have an opinion on that" "Exams?  We have exams?" "Nah, I don't really feel like we had enough reading this weekend" "You're right -- I'm a complete idiot" "Judges?  Completely infallible" "It's great the way all of these legal rules are applied so consistently" "I hear the Court just got rid of a 3-prong test and replaced it with a much simpler 2-prong test" "I've got this great visiting professor" "My casebook is so clear and easy to read" "Could I borrow your copy of the optional additional reading materials the professor said he wouldn't hold us responsible for on the exam?" "I think I'm just gonna wing it on the final" "I know you're having a tough time with the material -- but I bet if you came and sat in on a couple of our study group sessions, it would clear things up.  We'd be happy to have you join us even though you won't really be equipped to contribute anything just yet." "I love the cafeteria food" "I wish the professors were less prepared for class, less accessible, and seemed a lot more preoccupied with other stuff that was going on in their lives" "My fellow students? I'm probably the dumbest one here" "I got a C in that class" "This is so much better than lying on the beach" "You mean the lawyer wasn't telling the truth?" "You mean there are arguments on *both* sides?" "I've never heard of Judge Posner" "I think I'm gonna try and get a job with the government after I graduate" "Law review is fun" "You only got ten hours of sleep last night?" "I have scurvy"

      Thanks to the excellent  urlLink JD2B  for the link today that's brought gobs more visitors than normal.  Hope at least a few of you enjoy what you read and come back to visit again.  A few brief comments, and then I want to steal some content from the Princeton Review law school discussion board and offer my perspective on some stuff:  1. I'm living at home for this part of the summer, and we just got a DVD player for the first time.  And those director commentaries are mad cool.  Maybe it's just the novelty of it, but wow.  For anyone who writes, or dreams of writing, or is interesting in writing -- wow.  2. A friend and I came up with a great law school orientation activity the other day... since everyone feels pressured to go to everything those first few critical "don't want to be left without any friends" days... put up a sign saying "orientation activity, meet at wherever, and hand $50 to the guy in the top hat."  Then just put on a top hat and collect some cash.  Easy money.  3. Okay, now some real content.  JD2B linked today to a  urlLink Princeton Review thread  of a Harvard 2L answering questions.  One inquisitive soon-to-be 1L asks:  How was your first year (experience, competition, grades, etc.)? Is it as hard as everyone makes it out to be? Did you get a summer associate position? Which teachers did you find most interesting? How much time did you spend on assignments for class each day? How much did you study for finals?  My answers:   (1) Relax, soon-to-be-1L.  You'll figure it all out and you'll be fine.  Don't have a heart attack before school even starts.  If you have all of these questions and sound like a nervous wreck two months before school starts, you're going to be miserable by September and probably end up having an awful time at law school and not making any friends except with the other nervous wrecks and you can all go live in the library together.  Sorry, it's late, and I have no sympathy for people thinking about summer jobs and taking exams before they even get to school.    (2) First year's as fun as you want it to be.  You want to have a miserable time?  Good news is you can!  Want to be happy and well-adjusted?  Well, you can do that too!  There's lots of activities, related in various degrees to and not so much to the practice of law.  Find some you like, you'll make some friends, you'll keep busy, you'll have a good time.  Easy to do mediocre, not as easy to do great, but I'm not sure if doing great corresponds with number of hours studying, or corresponds at all with how miserable you are.  But feel free to put that one to the test.  There are people who hate school.  Go in trying to be one of them, and you'll likely succeed at that, but maybe not at class.  Who knows.  (3) Similarly, it's as hard as you make it.  The people who think it's hard are, by and large, making it hard for themselves.  Yes, there are probably for whom just getting by is hard.  But I think most of the people at law school -- at any law school, probably -- are more than capable of doing the work, it's just a matter of good study habits, decent time management, planning ahead, and not driving yourself nuts.  Don't get behind in the reading, don't try and write a thousand page outline, don't buy every study guide in the library, and (some controversial advice) get some sleep and don't stay out until 3AM every day.  (4) I didn't get a summer associate position, but I didn't interview for any.  Many of my friends who wanted 'em got 'em.  Some didn't.  Either way, you can get one after 2L year, and I imagine you'd have to be pretty messed up to not be able to get a job upon graduation, just from what I hear.  (5) I found the good teachers more interesting than the bad ones.  :)  1L professors are the luck of the draw.  You'll get good ones, bad ones, and mediocre ones I imagine.  And by the time you have any choice, you'll hear from enough people that you won't need any advice I can provide here.  Some people like the socratic ones, some like the other kind.  (6) I didn't spend an overwhelming amount of time on assignments for class, less as the year went by, and less the less chance there was I'd be called on.  In retrospect, I felt best when I tried to get the week's worth of reading disposed of over the weekend and could enjoy my week.  Which made the weekend less fun, but made me feel good I was always ahead of where I needed to be, and ensured I could get 9 hours of sleep a night.  Which made me unusually well-rested I suppose.  But I have no regrets about sleeping.  (7) I studied for finals as if it was a full-time job I was not very committed to.  Some hours in the morning, long lunch break, some unproductive hours in the afternoon, and generally not much after dinner.  Practice exams are the way to go -- not only are they more helpful, I find them more fun and interesting than just about any other study-related activity besides playing with post-it tabs.   Another asks: How was class generally? Students well-prepared and engaged or bored and consumed with Solitaire? How was the overall intellectual atmoshpere of the school? Conferences/speakers and the like available and readily announced? (and in a later post) How did you feel about the capabilities of your classmates?   (1) Way too much solitaire.  Disgraceful.  I think there should be a police officer in the back of the room who arrests any student caught playing a computer game.  It's disrespectful to the professor, and distracting to everyone in the room.  I am not kidding.  I am completely serious.  I think anyone who plays solitaire during class ought to stay home.    (2) That said, it's not so respectful when professors come to class unprepared to teach.  Not as common as one could imagine, but for some classes it happened sometimes.  I think they should stay home too if they can't do their job.  Of course, most of my professors were superbly prepared and extremely diligent and well-intentioned.  The result being that most classes were interesting.  I sure wish they required all professors to take some improvisational comedy lessons or something like that, because I found that a well-placed joke or quip or story or quick-witted reply could improve the enjoyment of the class tenfold.  Doesn't have to be as boring as it sometimes is.  Read Bill Bryson's new book about science as proof -- potentially boring subject, but I don't believe there's a more talented writer on the planet.  He could make anything a great read.  (3) Overall intellectual atmosphere?  I don't know what that means.  Lunchtime conversations smart things were not uncommon.  There are people who are into talking about affirmative action, the war in Iraq, and abortion -- and there are people into talking about cheese and tampons.  I have no idea why those two words came to mind.  Anyway, I think a mix of the two kinds of talk is good.  I might've wished for more introspective conversations about the meaning of life.  But that's just me.  Too many extroverts to get those going too often.  (4) Conferences and lectures are well-publicized.  Unfortunately, most of them aren't worth publicizing.  I find that stuff generally a little boring.  (5) I found some of my classmates to be quite swift, others of perfectly reasonable and capable intelligence, and a few to be on some other planet besides this one, or, as I sometimes wonder, not to have an internal monologue going on in their heads.  Like anywhere else.  I don't think it's possible for someone to be disappointed in the intellectual caliber of the people they'd find, as a whole.  There are enough super-bright people that it ought not be an issue no matter what you got on the LSAT.  :)   And then there was a whole bunch of crap about law review that if you read some stuff from end of May, beginning of June down below, I think I covered in about as much detail as anyone who doesn't live inside my head needs to know.  So there you have it, at least from my perspective.  (I'll also humbly take this opportunity, now that I have a stream of new visitors perhaps, to attempt to broaden an experiment I'm trying --  urlLink E-mail me  (subject line: e-mail list) to be added to a weekly e-mail list that'll send you the highlights of what I post here, plus some stuff that won't be posted here (maybe) and that I promise will make you laugh. Or your money back.  Of course also feel free to e-mail me if you have any questions about law school you'd like to see me ramble on about, or anything else.  There ain't nothing that makes the day go by faster than clicking to check e-mail and actually finding I have new messages.  Remarkable, that Internet thing.)

      About six months ago, I saw a segment on 60 Minutes about the peaceful Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan.  It made it sound pretty much like a paradise, actually, and then at the end talked about how it was beginning to modernize and had recently introduced television into the country for the first time.   urlLink This article , about what television seems to have done to their society, is very sad, and more than a little bit disturbing.  Much more interesting than the typical newspaper article.  Highly recommended.  I'd love to hear feedback on what other people think of it -- I thought it was a truly affecting story.

      The Children's Guide to Law School: Chapter 2 -- Going to Class  Most of the time, law school can be a lot of fun.  There's cool things to do (like rip pages out of library books), fun people to meet (one or two of them), and great food to be found somewhere, although usually nowhere near the actual campus.  But every so often -- only about twelve hours a week, so don't worry! -- you'll have to go to class.  Going to class sounds scary -- mean old people will stand up and talk at you, using big words and sounding like experts when really they're probably just reading from a book.  Of course, it's probably a book they wrote.  Teachers look funny when they talk, don't they? They look like aliens from the planet Zeptar. Zeptar is in between Mars and Jupiter, but because it's full of scary aliens, they don't talk about it in school much....  Anyway, in class the teachers will talk and talk and talk, but that's not really the scary part.  That's just the boring part (but you can play computer games and no one will care).  The scary part is when they want you to talk.  Like when the doctor gives you a shot but doesn't tell you first, you won't know when it's coming, and it can sometimes be a real surprise.  You'll be sitting in your seat, thinking about the pretty colored bricks on the wall of the building you can stare at through the window, and all of a sudden you'll hear your name called.  Sometimes your last name, because professors like to pretend nobody has first names, but sometimes your first name, and sometimes someone else's name, but since the professor will be looking at you, you'll just have to assume he means you, even if he gets your name wrong, even if you've been in his class for six weeks, even if he has a seating chart with your name on it right in front of him, even if you have a namecard right on front of you, even if you're his child, even if he doesn't even get your gender right.  And he'll ask you a question.  If you're lucky, he'll call your name before he asks the question, like, "Mr. Bubblegum, can you tell me why the judge gaboogledly googledly blah?" (so then, even though all of the words sound foreign, at least you can attempt to answer the question and only sound semi-stupid).  But sometimes he'll call your name after the question, and you'll be totally lost, like, "[staring at the flowers, pretty, pretty flowers] right, Ms. Jellyroll?"  And then what can you do but pretend you know exactly what is going on and just start throwing out some big long words.  "Jurisprudentially speaking," you'll say, "the gaboogledy googledly bloogleboggled."  And the professor will say "garumph," and call on somebody else.  Which is okay.  The thing to remember about class is that no one is listening to what you say.  Everyone is just sitting there thinking about the flowers, playing computer games, and praying they won't be called on.  You could stand up and go to the bathroom in the middle of the room, and as long as you didn't also scream really loud, no one would notice.  They might wonder what smells so bad, but, since these are law students, they would just assume they'd forgotten to shower that morning.  Or that the professor had an accident.  And no one wants to embarrass the professor by telling him they think he had an accident.  Instead they want to embarrass him by showing up to class completely unprepared and not paying any attention.  Plus, your performance in class counts in no way towards your grade, so it really doesn't matter much.  Just go to your six hours a week of class, count the snowflakes falling from the sky (unlike the lectures, they're all unique and different from each other), and you'll do fine.

      I saw "A Year in the Life of Frog and Toad" on Broadway last Friday night.  It's a musical.  Basically for kids.  And it closed on Sunday.  But I was able to get a $16 ticket, and I'd liked the song they did from the show on the Tony awards last weekend, so I figured it would be cool to go see it.  And it wasn't bad at all.  Simple, but entertaining.  The children in the audience seemed to be having a blast.  My friend who I went with and I both liked it.  In case you haven't heard of the Frog and Toad children's books, briefly -- Frog and Toad are best friends in the forest.  Frog is cheerful and helpful and happy, and Toad is a bit more grumpy.  But they help each other out.  The reason for all this background?  Today's weblog entry.  FROG AND TOAD WRITE THE LAW REVIEW COMPETITION  Frog and Toad waited on line to pick up the law review competition packet.  Frog got his copy, took a free lollipop, and waited patiently outside for his friend Toad.  Toad moaned: "This packet is so heavy I can hardly carry it.  It sucks."  But then Frog offered to carry Toad's packet too.  Toad agreed, but didn't give Frog his lollipop.  Instead, he threw it at a little tadpole.  Frog and Toad hopped home, installed their new DSL connections, and began reading.  Frog read everything carefully and then began to outline his case note.  Toad, in a fit of rage, threw his packet into the fireplace and burnt the edges of most of the pages.  Luckily for Toad, most of the pages were useless anyway, so it didn't matter.  Frog wrote all day and all night for the entire week, and ended up with a carefully-edited brief and a lovely case note suitable for publication in the Amphibian Law Journal.  Toad got drunk on Tuesday, vomited on two of the copies of his brief edit, and wrote a substandard case note riddled with errors.  But Frog agreed to let Toad copy much of his work, so they both ended up turning in wonderful packets.  They both beat out Sheep, Bear, Fox, Hawk, Paramecium, Jellyfish, Octopus, and Fatty Tuna to get a place on Law Review.  Toad had a nervous breakdown from all of the work.  But Dr. Dog at the mental hospital fixed him up and made him all better.  Frog ended up with a Supreme Pond Court clerkship, and all the flies he could eat.  He married Ruth Bader Ginsburg in a lovely ceremony at the beach.

      Uncensored: A Clip from Career Services' Career Counselor Training Video  NARRATOR: ...and that's how to look like you're carefully analyzing a student's resume when in fact you're just watching the second hand move around and around the clock.  Our next unit: how to handle "difficult" situations.  Watch this:  (A student enters the career counselor's office.  The counselor sees him and quickly hides the bottle of rum she's drinking from in her desk drawer.)  COUNSELOR: How may I help you, young man?  Are you looking to get your resume reviewed?  STUDENT: No, not really.  I'm a 1L, and I had some questions about summer jobs.  COUNSELOR: It can be hard to get a summer job at a firm, I know.  Firms are reluctant to hire 1Ls because they fear you'll just go elsewhere 2L summer, and they will have wasted all of that money.  You may want to look at smaller firms, or firms in cities beyond the traditional ones.  But keep plugging away and there's a good chance you'll find something.  STUDENT: Thanks, I understand all that.  But I had a question about stuff that isn't necessarily at a firm.  COUNSELOR: Not at a firm?  What do you mean?  Do you mean at a smaller boutique firm?  STUDENT: Well, no.  I mean something where the legal education is helpful, but it's not necessarily a law job -- like in government, or in business.  COUNSELOR: Not a firm?  STUDENT: No.  COUNSELOR: How many firms have you sent resumes to?  Maybe you're just not looking hard enough.  STUDENT: None.  COUNSELOR: Well that would explain it.  STUDENT: No, I don't want to work at a firm.  COUNSELOR: Have you tried Nashville?  That's a medium-sized market with firms that often hire 1Ls.  STUDENT: No, you're not really listening.  I don't want to work at a firm, and I was wondering if you had any resources for jobs that aren't at firms.  COUNSELOR: We do have a binder listing all of the firms that have hired 1Ls in the past.  STUDENT: But I'm not looking for a firm.  COUNSELOR: How you tried the website firm directory?  STUDENT: Not looking for a firm.  COUNSELOR: What about our law firm summer evaluation database?  STUDENT: Don't want a firm job.  COUNSELOR: We have some firm listings online.  STUDENT:  You don't understand.  I don't want to work at a law firm this summer.  Is there anyone who can help me find something else?  COUNSELOR: Wait.  Are you saying you don't want to work at a law firm?  STUDENT: Correct.  COUNSELOR: You do realize how much money they make, right?  STUDENT: Yes.  COUNSELOR: Are you on any medications?  STUDENT: No.  COUNSELOR: Under the care of a mental health professional?  STUDENT: No.  COUNSELOR: I think your best place to turn might be the mental health clinic.  STUDENT: I'm not crazy.  I just don't want to work at a firm.  COUNSELOR: We can fix that.  STUDENT: I don't want to be "fixed."  I just want to do something more in line with my interests and passions.  COUNSELOR: A few pills, maybe a lobotomy, and you'll be all set.  STUDENT: Just looking for job leads.  COUNSELOR: Electroshock therapy, hypnosis, lithium...  STUDENT: Please.  Just some job ideas.  That's all I want.  COUNSELOR: Just some job leads?  STUDENT: Yes.  COUNSELOR: Not at a law firm?  STUDENT: Correct.  COUNSELOR: Are you suicidal?  STUDENT: No.  COUNSELOR: Okay.  I think I understand.  You want help finding a job, but not a job at a law firm.  STUDENT: That's right.  COUNSELOR: But you haven't been to our mental health clinic?  STUDENT: No.  COUNSELOR: Well, I really think that should be your first step.  STUDENT: We just went over this.  I'm not crazy.  COUNSELOR: Maybe, maybe not.  But even if you're not, and that's a big "if," most anyone else who doesn't want a firm job surely is.  STUDENT: So?  COUNSELOR: And so the mental health clinic is going to have the best ideas for you -- from all of the people who've been through there before.  They'll know what kinds of jobs "people like you" tend to be able to find.  STUDENT: People like me?  COUNSELOR: Yes.  People who don't want to work for a firm.  Crazy people.  I mean people like you.  STUDENT: So the mental health people are the only ones who would know of jobs not at law firms.  COUNSELOR: Correct.  STUDENT: So even if I'm not crazy, I should go there.  COUNSELOR: Yes.  STUDENT: And they'll give me job leads.  COUNSELOR: And some prescriptions that'll help you out.  STUDENT: But job leads too.  COUNSELOR: Yes.  STUDENT: Thanks for your help.  NARRATOR: And that, as you could tell, is how to deal with students who are mentally ill.  Up next, we'll show you how to deal with students looking to choose between navy suits and gray suits...

      "Where's My E-mail?"  I can't believe it.  Can't they ever plan ahead?  It's already June and nothing yet this summer from the career services office at school.  How do they expect me to be able to interview for law firm jobs two and a half months from now when they haven't yet started flooding my inbox with needlessly complicated instructions?  Where's an e-mail about how I have to submit eight copies of my left thumb fingerprint to the registrar by Tuesday, August 32nd at 26 o'clock or else I will be slotted in round Q of the law firm interview lottery and only have a 41% chance of getting 7 of my top 12 firm choices in 2 of my top 3 city selections?  Where?  Where? Where?  How am I supposed to know if Lonely and Depressed LLP is interviewing before or after Sullen, Withdrawn and Partners if they don't send me a schedule. How am I supposed to find time to do my firm research if I don't have an e-mail from career services telling me where Stressed, Overworked, and Premature Artery Blockage (Blockage is pronounced like Fromage; they're a French firm) is interviewing.   At least my schedule is fairly open most evenings; I don't work too late, so if I get the e-mails in a week or two, I'll still have time to figure it all out.  Just barely.  But what about my friends at law firms?  How will they ever...?  Especially with all of the events the firms plan for them.  I hear stories of fancy dinners at the best restaurants (those people who took jobs in Milwaukee are kicking themselves right about now... three nights in a row at Applebee's?  I know it's the best restaurant in town, but still...), tickets to baseball games, Broadway shows, and tapings of The People's Court, trips to white-collar prison to visit the firm's fallen colleagues, free nights in cheap motels with hookers... oh wait, they weren't supposed to expense that?  But the gambling was okay, right?  And the heroin?  Only up to a hundred dollars?  A hundred Euros?  I don't understand all of these regulations.  Every time I ask my boss to reimburse me for my Metrocard expenses, I think of my friends at law firms, making twenty-five billion - excuse me, trillion - dollars a week, and don't feel jealous at all.  Because they still ride the subway one stop at a time.  Except they take taxis. Gold-plated taxis.  Driven by people who speak fluent English.  Gosh.  But I had a gourmet lunch today.  Two steamed pork buns for a dollar.  Amazing deal.  They were worth it.  Every penny.  My boss brought his dog to work and he was begging for scraps.  But I don't know if American dogs eat Chinese food.  I didn't want to risk it.  Making your boss's dog vomit - not a good idea.  Except at a law firm, where the odds that it would affect your ultimate chances of getting an offer are probably pretty slim.  Killing the dog, maybe.  If you also killed your boss.  Otherwise, I'm guessing you're home free.  Well, not free exactly.  Twenty-five trillion dollars a week. And your own secretary.  It's now been seven minutes since I started writing this (can't you tell?), and still no e-mail from career services.  But I did get something about a computer virus that's evidently invading the system.  Their virus "cure" instructions: "If your computer is infected, the recommended approach is to immediately remove the computer from the network to prevent damage from hackers and to rebuild the machine from scratch."  Okay, so the "cure" is to erase everything off of your hard drive and start over.  And that's better than what the virus would do because... yeah, that's what I thought.  It's a good thing doctors don't follow the same rules.  "I've got it!  A cure for diphtheria!  All you have to do is leap off the roof!  No more sickness!" "Hey, you're stealing!  That's exactly the same as my cure for tetanus!" "But then what's the cure for leaping off the roof?"  "Asphyxiation."  "Oh."  I think that's the cure for the recruiting process too.

      Advertisement on the NYC Subway for a law firm -- descriptions of cases they've won for damage from lead poisoning and medical malpractice -- and a slogan, in quotes: "We fight for kids with brain damage."  Wow.  And the ad includes a silhouette of a man with a top hat and boxing gloves -- "fighting," I suppose, "for kids with brain damage."  Wow.  And it gets better.  Because I went to their website,  urlLink Ambulance-Chasing Law Firm's Website , where they explain the top hat / boxing glove man: "Were proud of being known as fighters for our clients rights and the [firm's] fighting spirit is embodied in our logo and our mascot, Seamus, our Fighting Irish Leprechaun."  You think I'm kidding?  Check out the site.    If you do some exploring, you may notice the site includes a detailed questionnaire for people seeking the firm's help in suing the tobacco companies.  Among the perfectly balanced and fair questions: "What disease do you have that you think was caused by smoking?"    This is why people think lawyers are sleazy.  Seamus the Fighting Irish Leprechaun is why people make jokes about lawyers.  Does a fighting leprechaun mascot really help them get clients?  "Good day, my lead-poisoned friend.  I know a great law firm.  I saw their ad on the subway.  I know they're good because they have a fighting Irish leprechaun mascot named Seamus.  And they advertise on the subway.  Did I mention that already.  I don't know if I did.  Because I have brain damage.  But they're fighting for me.  The leprechaun dude is actually my lawyer.  I think.  Or that might be the brain damage talking.  Who knows."

      Orientation for introverts.  I don't like new situations.  It takes me a little while to get comfortable, to relax, to engage.  I'm fine once I've adjusted, but right at the beginning I'm quiet, timid, careful.  Which makes orientations and stuff of that nature not the most fun.  I don't like going around in a circle and talking about myself.  Too much pressure right away.  Concern about the first impressions.  I don't like "interviewing" a partner and introducing him or her to the rest of the group.  I like people, I really do, but I feel like I do better when I can get to know them at a natural pace, and not through a name game.  So, with that endless setup for the (hopefully) funny stuff to come, here's my ideas for activities for "orientation for introverts."  1. Write your name on a nametag and stick it on your shirt.  Walk around and look at everyone else's nametags.  2. Sit in a circle and try not to make eye contact with anyone.  3. Pull blades of grass out of the ground and make a small grass pile.  4. Try to stick the blades of grass back in the ground.  5. Tear little sticky pieces off the sides of your nametag.  6. Nap.  7. Whisper superficial conversation to the person next to you.  "It's sunny out."  "Yes, it is."  "They say rain later."  "Oh."  8. Go to the bathroom.  9. Lock yourself in the stall and cry.  10. Splash some water on your face and force yourself to rejoin the group.  11. Linger on the fringes of the clump of people.  12. Stare at the ground.  13. Pick some more grass.  14. Fidget.  15. Write out another nametag to replace the one you've accidentally ripped off and folded until it became all crumbly and disintegrated.  16. Wander for a bit.  17. Play with your fingers.  18. Ask if you can go home.

      The real study group advice I promised a few days ago when my post degenerated into a "Dear Diary" tale of study groups gone awry:  1. It's not a race.  You don't need to be the first one to have a study group.  I can't for the life of me figure out why a study group would be of any value in September, or October, or anytime before Thanksgiving -- heck, anytime before reading period.  Because what is there to study?  You're hardly in law school, there's nothing to review for, you don't know what you'll need to study.  A friend to ask what he thinks when you don't understand something in a case?  Sure.  Three-hour meetings twice a week?  Watch TV instead.  If you haven't worn your winter coat yet (or, in the case of people in warm-weather climates, long pants), you shouldn't be in a study group.  2. Before you commit, make sure your study styles are all semi-compatible, and I just mean in the "how long will our meetings be and what will we do" sense; anything else matters not.  If you think the point of a study group should be to go over practice exams a week before the test and maybe share outlines right at the end, just to double-check you haven't missed anything key, it's probably a bad idea to be in a study group with someone who wants to meet for an hour every morning and go over the reading.  Heck, if you want to meet every morning for an hour and go over the reading, I don't think you should be in a study group regardless.  You should be in a mental hospital.  3. Study groups ought to be fun.  You're going to be spending perhaps a bunch of hours with these people.  If you don't like them, don't join their study group.  Study with your friends, or least with people who you think could become your friends, because studying doesn't have to be torture.  Being in a room with people you don't like will make you unhappy.  Unhappy people are less productive.  That said, someone out there is thinking, "but if I study with my friends we'll end up having fun and not getting any studying done."  Well, if you can't force yourself to get work done in a group, maybe you should study alone.  And anyway, it's not like you're going to fail the exam.  If you have fun and don't get anything done for two hours one afternoon, the world won't explode.  I see very little reason to actively try to avoid activities that might be fun, even if you think they're not supposed to be because they involve studying.  Look, everyone at law school has enough self-discipline to make themselves study when they need to study.  There are lots of reasons why a study group might not work out -- different styles of learning, different time management skills, personality conflicts -- "it's too much fun" shouldn't be one of them.  4. Just because they ask you... doesn't mean you have to say yes.  Also doesn't mean you have to say no.  Just think about it.  Ask yourself if they hadn't asked you, would you have asked them.  Ask yourself if you're saying yes just because it's nice to be asked.  Ask yourself why these people are forming a study group on the second week of school.  5. Practice exams, practice exams, practice exams.  This is what study groups are best for, in my humble opinion.  Just thought I'd repeat that.  6.  Don't just trade outlines.  Well, maybe the day before the exam or something.  But if you're using a study group to get out making your own study materials, whatever they happen to be to best fit your style, you're just sabotaging your own efforts to learn the material.  I found that I learned best when I did things myself instead of just reading someone else's work output.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Just a warning.  7.  Don't let a bad study spoil a good friendship.  It's not worth it.  Study groups are easy to find, friends less so.  (Isn't that a lovely piece of advice?  Not tinged with sarcasm, I swear.)  8. Studying sucks.  Studying with other people can sometimes make it suck less, even if you get nothing done.  I recommend being in a study group for three reasons ("Why couldn't you just list those three reasons at the top and forget about these eight points?"  "Shut up."): (1) Practice exams, (2) Because it's lonely to study alone and you need interaction with people sometimes, and (3) Because if you're not in a study group you're going to feel left out and wonder what all of the people in study groups are doing (the answer: wasting their time, probably, and not really getting anything of any use done -- so no reason to be jealous)  9. The last list I did had nine points also -- see below.  Just figured I'd make this one match even though I really only had eight things to say.  10. Nah, I'll make this one an even ten.

      Whoops!   urlLink Waddling Thunder  just posted a terrific response to my advice about outlining (below, from a couple of days ago), and it made me realize I forgot all about practice exams.  Not that I forgot to do them when I was studying, just that I forgot to write about them, and so my post makes it look like I study for exams without thinking about practice exams.  Which, of course, would be wrong, wrong, wrong!  Practice exams are weapon #1, more important than the world's best outline, more important than knowing the material cold, more important, I dare say, than somehow finding a loophole in the rules that allows you to have a leading scholar in whatever field your exam is about standing by your side ready to help you with the exam.  Because professors, I dare say, are human.  And they have preferences and styles and patterns that come up in their exams.  And the more familiar you are with their exams -- like when you're taking standardized tests and trying to get into the heads of the College Board and figure out why the wrong answers are wrong so that you can better understand why the right answers are right -- the better you'll do.  Waddling Thunder talks about doing exams from other schools, and other professors before doing exams from his professor.  I understand the theory there -- the more practice the better, and real questions given by *some * professor are better than no questions at all.  I didn't look at any other professor's exams -- mostly because I had enough exams to go through that there wouldn't have been time, but I thought about it, and was concerned that it may not be worth the time.  Because even in a standard class like Contracts, each professor teaches different stuff.  They emphasize different things, they have you read different cases, they have different things they want.  It would be uber-frustrating to work on an exam from another school, puzzle through something hard, and then either (a) not be sure whether you're responsible for that nugget of knowledge anyway, or (b) realize you've just wasted your time on something you figure out you don't need to know -- and, yeah, I know (a) and (b) are pretty much the same thing and should just be labeled (a).  Less of a problem with other professors at the same school -- because at least you won't be wading into some trap where all California law schools teach special California rules about owning figs and raisins (I have no idea how my mind made me write "figs and raisins") -- but still the same issue of who knows what other professors are teaching, what kinds of questions they like, and what kinds of answers they're looking for.  Even in a standard issue-spotter -- my property professor told us not to worry about things like the recording system, and not so much about the rule against perpetuities (although a little bit).  Other professors think differently, I'm sure.  Heck, even among your own professor's past exams, there could be some years he or she emphasized different parts of the course, used a different casebook, skipped a unit, added a unit, had a brain disease in the middle of the semester that caused him to go on a tangent about the law of turkey legs.  Or something like that.  So, yes, yes, yes do as many old exams as you can tolerate and have time for.  But realize that exams that aren't geared to the same things you learned and in the same style as your professor aren't going to be as helpful.  And there's always the chance a professor will get lazy and repeat an exam question.  It does happen.  I've heard stories.    But even more likely, they repeat concepts, ideas, policy questions, turns of phrase -- and the more familiar you are with how they think, the better prepared you'll be.  They also often repeat instructions, so, like on the SAT and LSAT, you can save a minute by pre-reading instructions off previous exams.  Of course, you'll want to double check on your exam so that you don't answer the essay like it's a multiple choice question, or something silly like that.  Imagine, a 5 part essay question: Do (a), (b), (c), (d), and (e) that someone answers as a multiple choice question.  (a).  Ha.  That would be funny.  More exam advice -- going over an exam with a friend or two is probably the only thing a study group is useful for, in my opinion.  Do that.  Especially on issue spotters.  They'll see issues you won't.  And vice versa.  A learning experience for all.  And isn't that what law school is all about.

      [A fictional study group tale that was supposed to actually make sense, but just sort of degenerated into pointlessness.  I'll have some actual words about study groups tomorrow, once I get this train of thought out of my system]  October 15, 2002  Dear Diary,  I can't believe it!  One of the cool kids asked me to join his study group!  I mean, it's not that I'm not cool.  Especially here.  Where nobody's cool.  But in law school, like everywhere, there are the cool kids, and there are the not-that-cool kids.  And it just sort of falls into place like that.  I don't know if the cool kids here were cool before, or nobody here was cool before and they're just the coolest of the uncool.  But anyway, it just seems to happen that one group of kids is cool, and the rest aren't.  And everybody knows.  But maybe I'm doing something right (or wrong, as the case may be) because there it was -- right below the e-mail about the resume workshop and above the e-mail about the overdue library book.  The e-mail from the cool kid about joining his study group.  Maybe it's that new shirt I bought last week.  Or the new deodorant scent (switched from "Mountain Fresh" to "Valley Clean").  Or the twenty-five page outline I've already made that I happened to mention in conversation yesterday.  No, it can't be the outline.  It must be the new shirt.  But boy am I excited.  Because it's not just the cool kid who invited me -- the study group is filled with cool kids.  There's the kid who only shows up to class on Wednesdays, "just because."  Now what could be cooler than that?  There's the kid who's always wearing the hat.  Hats are super-cool.  And there's the kid who's going out with the professor.  The married professor.  The married professor with the wrinkles and the cane.  Now that's unbelievably cool.  And it's the three of them, and me.  So I must be cool too.  Or at least cool by association.  Maybe we'll all go do cool stuff besides studying.  Like go get ice cream.  Or hang out on a street corner without any real purpose.  Or swipe study guides from the law school bookstore.  Or graffiti the dorm building.  I can't wait for our first meeting tomorrow at midnight.  Midnight.  I guess that's when cool people do their schoolwork.  October 17, 2002  Dear Diary,  I'm pretty tired.  Only three hours of sleep.  And my left arm is sore from the punching.  They called it my "initiation," but if I didn't know better, I'd say they just wanted to beat me up.  Study group is nothing like I imagined.  So I got to the bar at midnight -- we met in a bar -- with my laptop, my outlines, and this great study guide I fashioned out of a roll of masking tape, three copies of Black's Law Dictionary, and some magic fairy dust.  And the cool kids were late.  Two of them showed up at about 12:30, kind of drunk, and looking like they'd been doing something naughty.  I think one of them mentioned they carjacked an elderly man on the way over, just for kicks, but I'm not totally sure.  They might have just been talking about one of the cases we're reading.  The third guy -- the coolest one -- didn't show up at all.  But I'm sure he had a good reason.  Anyway, they didn't come as prepared as I did.  They accidentally left their books at home.  And their outlines were lost, they said.  But I'm sure they'll send me a copy as soon as they find them.  So first they took my study guide.  We've decided to all share materials -- apparently that's what the good study groups do.  Whatever one person makes, he has to give to everybody.  But that's okay, because they're all really cool about it.  I'm sure they would never make an outline and not share it with me.  Unless they decided I wasn't cool enough.  Anyway, then they said they had to initiate me into the study group.  They took turns spitting on me and punching me in the arm.  I guess this is what cool people do.  And then they stole my pants.  They're such cool guys.  We're meeting tomorrow to talk about Contracts.  Not until three in the morning, though.  October 19, 2002  The study group split up.  Apparently I wasn't cool enough for them.  We met yesterday, but only Jimmy showed up.  He asked me if I wanted to hang out a little first, before we started studying.  Of course I said yes.  He asked if I could drive "getaway."  It was pretty cool.  Jimmy has an awesome car.  A Lexus SUV.  So we drove to the bank, and I waited outside.  Jimmy came back a few minutes with a big bag.  He told me to "step on it."  But it turned out he meant the gas pedal, not the bag.  Oops.  And then he punched me a few more times and stole my laptop.  I think my next study group is going to be with the uncool kids.

      Check out this  urlLink Fox News story  about a survey of the favorable and unfavorable ratings of the 2004 presidential contenders.  Notice the "never heard of" category, which can make you wonder who the 1% of the population is who's never heard of Hillary Clinton and the 4% who's never heard of Dick Cheney.  And apparently it was only six months ago that 1% had never heard of George W. Bush.  I guess he must have done something recently to increase his profile, for those who missed the fact that he's President.  Maybe he made a cameo in a music video or something.

      All About Outlining -- And all about Studying for Exams -- This is my story of how I prepared for my 1L exams; I feel like maybe someone out there will find it interesting and useful for me to have shared, as I watch the Mets get slaughtered by the Mariners on both sides of a doubleheader...  After reading "Law School Confidential," "Planet Law School," and a library of other pre-law books over the summer, and then after hearing things from classmates and upperclassmen and even professors, within the first couple of weeks of school, it became pretty clear that the conventional wisdom is that outlining your classes is the way to go if you want to do well.  What I mean by outlining, for the uninitiated -- basically making yourself a big course summary, with all of the law, the cases, the principles, the topics you're going to need to know for the exam.  Turning the class, in effect, into a packet of somewhere between 20 and 200 pages (depending on the class, your style, and how much it costs you to print).  Throughout September and October I heard people asking each other about their outlines -- mostly "have you started yet," but occasionally "what are you putting in your outline," "is there a standard format," and "what about those commercial outlines they sell in the bookstore but don't let you return for fear that you'll photocopy them and start your own competing discount outline sales business."  Again, the conventional wisdom is that you shouldn't wait too long to start outlining, because you'll end up with way too much to do at once -- the casebook pages and class notes build up and the task becomes insurmountably time-consuming.  So, like a good little eager law student, after the first two weeks of classes, I decided that I would outline over the weekend.  First, I chose a pleasing mix of fonts and determined a format -- cases get their own little text boxes, legal rules are in bold, class notes and summarized after the cases, other principles the professors threw in are in italics... I probably spent more time coming up with my template than I did actually doing anything productive.  And, sure enough, I was able to go through my class notes and turn lots of pages in somewhat fewer, and add in some brief paragraphs about the cases.  But had I really accomplished anything?  Was this useful?  No idea.  Three weeks later, feeling a little guilty that I hadn't been so diligent about the outlines, I returned to my contracts outline to get it up to date.  And realized, upon re-reading what I'd done after week two, that the information I had written in wasn't really that useful, and that now, three weeks later, some of the things I had thought were important weren't, and some of the things I thought were confusing were now second-nature and didn't even need to be written down.  And all the formatting stuff was a pain in the neck.  But, just to feel like I had accomplished something, I updated the outline.  Fast-forward to the end of fall semester, gliding past hours and hours of time spent not updating my outlines, and, as I sat down to start studying for exams, I had 5 weeks of a contracts outline (at 40 pages, a monstrosity already), 2 weeks of a civil procedure outline, and a stack of criminal law class notes that were about as organized as this weblog post (and, unfortunately for this weblog post and anyone reading it, about as funny).  And I tried to think about whether trying to outline all of this stuff was worth it.  And I realized I'd been going about it all wrong.    You see, the conventional wisdom (or at least as I understood it) was:  1. Making the outline is a valuable undertaking because it helps you learn the material 2. The outline is uber-useful during the exam so you don't have to go back to the casebook, class notes, etc.  But those two goals are not the same, and often can't be met with the same tool.  I don't think you need to outline for the sake of outlining, and, after two semesters of law school, I don't think an outline is always the most useful thing for meeting either of those objectives. (1) Doing something to learn the material, and (2) Making something to use during the exam are two separate endeavors, I think.  And after realizing that, I came up with my own system for each.  Nothing revolutionary, but different from just taking the casebook and class notes and turning it into an outline and then feeling like I'm done.  Personally, I just didn't find that made so much sense.  So, admittedly with only my fall semester grades to inform on the effectiveness of my approach, here's what I did:  Goal 1: Learning the material  My big worry on this dimension is always gaps.  Large chunks of material that I'm forgetting, rules I didn't write down, cases I glossed over, things that could come up on an exam that I don't want to say "uh, what is that, I have no idea."  That worries me more than comprehension failings -- things where I know what it is, and know I don't understand it that well, but at least I recognize that and know where the weakness exists.  I worry more about surprises.  My strategy, therefore, was to read lots of different materials in the hope that no gaps would remain.  For each class (except for Torts, but we were heavy on theory / light on law in torts, and the exam was to reflect that (and ultimately did reflect that) so I didn't feel the need to have backup):  1. I started with the Lexis free Emanuel's summary as my baseline.  Because it's a Word file and I could edit it without typing everything in.  I went through and deleted anything we didn't cover, and added in topic heading for things that weren't included, just so I'd remember to make sure I knew that stuff too.  Printed, read through a few times, put aside.  2. Then, for 3 of the 5 classes, I bought a commercial study guide of some sort that seemed to track well with the class in terms of material covered (Dressler for Crim, Glannon for Civ Pro, Singer for Property).  Not black letter law -- the Emanuel's was for that -- but for concepts and an overall understanding.  And read them cover to cover.  Did a little bit of highlighting, but mostly I was reading for overall themes.  And put them aside.  3. Did a google search and a lexis search for short overall subject summaries -- what's the overall story of contract law, property law, criminal law, how do all of the discrete subjects fit together into one discipline.  I wanted to be able to make sure I could answer a general thematic question.  4. Read through my class notes a few times, and added stuff to the Emanuel's that filled in gaps.  Printed the Emanuel's again.  Read it a few more times until I knew it pretty well.  5. And at that point, I felt pretty good about content and knowing the material.  It was then time to turn my attention to the second goal.  Goal 2: Having stuff for the exam  This may seem like it doesn't apply to a closed-book exam, but I think it does.  Just means you can't bring the stuff in the room with you and have to memorize the important pieces.  I knew the thick Emanuel's packet wouldn't really be of great help during an exam, and the books and class notes too big and comprehensive to rely on consistently for stuff like 3-part tests, quick rule applications, etc.  And yet I wasn't motivated to create my own materials from scratch because (1) I didn't know whether they'd be right, and (2) It would take a long time and a lot of work.  1. So I stole.  Well, borrowed.  Completely legally.  We had an outline bank with old outlines that people had posted.  Most people searched them for stuff from our professors' past classes, and there was some decent stuff for some of the classes.  I went a step further and searched for anything in the same subject, regardless of professor -- really just looking for charts / tables / schematic diagrams / easy explanations / quick case summaries that someone else had made that I could use.  So I'd pull the best Erie Choice of Law diagram from one outline, a Model Penal Code vs. Common Law chart from another, the "three sentences about every UCC rule" chart from something else -- just taking the best of what I could find, until I had a stack of application tools that I felt were useful for an exam.  Read through to make sure they were accurate (important step) and then put them aside.  2. Besides the application tools from the outlines, I also made a short issue-spotting helper... basically a mini-outline of all of the possible "questions" that could come up on a test.  "Was there a proper offer?"  "Was it mere puff?"  "Was there valid consideration?"  I think it was about 2-5 pages for each class... just for issue spotters, as the last step review during the test to make sure I hadn't missed anything.  For the closed book portion of my contracts exam, I turned it into a mnemonic of all of the units, that had 13 letters and was unpronounceable and that I can't recall.  3. A case chart.  If I couldn't find one elsewhere, I made one myself.  Just a list of every case and three or four words to remind me what it was about.  To refer to on questions that wanted case names or analogies, or to back up policy arguments.  And that was pretty much it.  Lots of different pieces of materials, but not really an outline.  And I didn't do any of it until after classes were over, because as I looked through what I'd typed up at the beginning of the semester, I realized that I didn't at that point know what was important, what was confusing, and what I'd know so well I wouldn't need to write down.  So all of the outline stuff I didn't really find that valuable.  My collection of assorted materials may not work for everyone -- some people may need one comprehensive piece they create themselves that's 200 pages thick and has everything.  And that's cool.  This is just an explanation (and a long one!) of what I did, in case anyone finds it helpful.  We'll return to something funnier tomorrow.

      Tales from the working world, volume 1  After a year of school Id forgotten this, but sitting at a desk from early in the morning until midway through the evening  no matter what youre doing, really  ruins the whole day.  I dont mean that to sound as negative as the only fair reading of it would indicate.  I just mean it gives you hardly a chance to do much else besides eat, sleep, and write a carefully constructed, riotously funny (or should that be uproariously funny...) 800-word column each week.  Because youre in an office, at a desk, and even if youre doing cool things, theyre not your things.  Theyre someone elses things, some faceless corporations things perhaps, or some faceless governments things, or, if youre working for a professor this summer, some grotesquely-faced monsters things.  No, I dont really mean that.  Unlike many of you, Im not working for a law firm this summer, so I dont have any hilarious stories to tell about how the senior partner cited the wrong precedent (ha, ha, ha!), or how the seventh-year associate flung himself off the roof of the building to his death (ha, ha, ha!), or how at the firms weekly lobster dinner everybody got crabs (ha, ha, ha!).  Nor am I working for any legal public interest happy wealth redistribution helping poor people environmentally friendly policy litigation save the world organization, so I have no stories about how my boss lives in a van down by the river, or how the people in the office cant afford shoes so they all walk around wearing paper bags on their feet  recycled paper  and for lunch make sandwiches out of their toenail clippings.  Nor am I working for the government, so I have no stories about the three-hundred dollar paper clip dispenser on my desk, the six-hundred dollar light bulb hanging over my desk, and (please dont tell me you could see this one coming a mile away, because it will spoil the illusion I have in my head that this is going to be funny) the pretty young intern  under my desk.  Instead, as makes perfect sense given that Im in law school, earning a law degree, which will prepare me to become a lawyer, and practice law, Im working for a non-legal-related-at-all company.  I have, however, done one Lexis search at work.  Law student and Not working at a law firm nor a public interest organization nor the government nor a judge came up with zero results.  And caused Lexis to cancel my account and automatically redeem my Lexis points for a $10 gift certificate to the mental health clinic, and a lifetime membership at the International House of Debt.  (Actually, the International House of Debt is running a special promotion this week: buy one, get three taken away.  Is that funny?  I have no idea.)  I actually wrote that last paragraph this morning, before I went to work, and didnt show it to anyone.  However, Lexis monsters have apparently infiltrated my fingertips, because, in fact, I tried to do a Lexis search today (hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt from a law school education and wannabe writer but not John Grisham) and discovered that Lexis really did cancel my account.  Or at least is now limiting me to searches in the Martindale-Hubbell directory (which allows me to find the names of game show hosts from the 1970s and space telescopes) or North Korean Lawyer magazine (this months issue, at almost one full page, is actually a double issue to commemorate the anniversary of when some dude filed a lawsuit and then got beheaded by government agents).  Apparently if we want summer access we have to be doing something somewhat tangentially related to the law.  Oops.  But, surprisingly enough, even my non-legal employer is trying to use my supposed legal knowledge to its advantage.  Young intern with baffling career path, my boss said to me today, stop writing semi-humorous things about me on your computer in windows you quickly try and close whenever I walk by but I see anyway because you dont click fast enough and come over here so I can give you real work.  I saved my file and rolled my chair-on-wheels down the ramp (handicapped access rules) to his desk.  Im assuming you know some law, since youre at law school.  Me: Uh... sure.  Him: I want you to take a look at these contracts we use for stuff and tell me how we can make them better.  Me: Better?  Him: Yeah.  More advantageous to us, but less advantageous to the people we do business with.  But in a legal way.  Can you do that?  Me: Can I do that?  Can alligators juggle?  Of course I can do that!    On Monday, the police will be arriving to take my boss away in handcuffs because of some funny business with his new contracts.  He will be cursing the day he said no, thats not necessary when I asked him if he wanted to see a transcript of my first-semester grades.  Law firms, of course, have all been cursing the day when they said no, thats not necessary when I asked if I should come work for them this summer.    And, just recently, I have been cursing the day I said no, thats not necessary when the waitress at the little Chinese restaurant I discovered has a $1.95 lunch special asked if she should wash her hands before touching my food.  No, Im kidding.  And, yeah, I know that wasnt really particularly funny.  But if you read this far, is that really going to stop you from getting to the end?

      The Children's Guide to Law School: a work-in-progress (part 2 of ??)  Chapter One: Arriving at Law School  Welcome to the first chapter of your law school adventure.  If you've read the introduction, you know that law school is where people go to learn what things are okay to do (like eat the cream out of the middle of an Oreo cookie before you eat the cookies), and what things are not okay to do (like make a pipe bomb out of Oreo cookies and use it to blow up the Hydrox factory).  And I've already told you that law school is a lot like preschool.  Except while preschool takes place in a safety-hazard-ridden living room of an unemployed scam artist who decided that pretending to watch a bunch of kids all day was easier than getting a real job, law school usually takes place in big fancy buildings with pictures of old people hanging on all of the walls.  Some of the old people might look like your grandparents.  Except these old people are much meaner and like to make children cry.  Judge Robert Bork once physically removed a child's intestines with his bare hands.  I know that's true because I read it in one of those colorful newspapers your mom always reads on line at the grocery store but never buys.  It was on the page right after the article about the three-headed werewolf child.  Before your surgery, you were a three-headed werewolf too.  But don't tell anyone I told you, because I think it's supposed to be a secret.  The first thing you will see when you walk inside a law school building is probably a large group of people carrying books the size of the boxes your toys come in, and crying.  You might wonder why they are so sad, but in fact they aren't really sad.  It's just something they've gotten used to after a few weeks at law school.  The teachers make them carry heavy books.  Heavier than mommy's belly while she's pregnant with the new child that will take your place and make her love you less.  The second thing you will notice is how strange the people at law school are.  It's because theyve all done well on a test called the L-S-A-T. You may remember the S-A-T from my previous book, The Childrens Guide to a Small Set of Elite Undergraduate Colleges and Universities that Your Parents Probably Cant Afford To Send You To Anyway, or at least not after Daddy divorces Mommy and burns the house down. The L-S-A-T is a similar test. But whats interesting about the L-S-A-T is that while there may or may not be a correlation between L-S-A-T score and pretty much anything else, depending on who you ask, theres a really high correlation between L-S-A-T score and having have some sort of latent psychological disorder. Thats why so many of the people youll find at Law School walk around muttering to themselves, or spend all of their waking hours in a library, drawing on windows with marking pencils and daydreaming about working for the C.I.A. You may recognize this plot if your parents couldnt find a babysitter and took you with them when they went to see A Beautiful Mind, a movie about a crazy math professor who won a special prize for his work. Whether or not youve seen the movie, theres a valuable lesson hidden between the lines: only crazy people win special prizes.  Anyway, the students are also strange because they want to be lawyers, and normal people would never want to be lawyers.  Normal people want to play all day.  Like with fun toys, or with coloring books, or with Mommy's ears.  But lawyers don't get to play at all.  They have to write memos and do legal research.  A memo is kind of like those boring things Mommy gets in the mailbox that come in envelopes and have lots of words on them.  Not very fun.  And legal research is kind of like when you have to go to the potty and it's kind of hard to get everything out and you have to squeeze a lot.  That's what doing legal research feels like.  Not very fun either.  So lawyers are not fun people like you are.  Instead of toys they have heavy books and instead of food, they eat sticks and leaves.  Sharp sticks, like Daddy throws at Mommy sometimes after she yells at him for not taking out the trash and for going to the hotel with his pretty secretary and taking her clothes off.  Daddy likes to take the clothes off of his secretary, and she does not like wearing clothes.  Mommy should buy her things like the nice sailor outfit she bought you and then maybe she would not want to take off her clothes for Daddy.  Maybe if Mommy was a better wife also.  The other thing you might see when you go to law school, if your law school is in New Haven, Connecticut, is an explosion.  But we won't talk about that because explosions are scary and because it's horribly inappropriate for me to be writing about that.  So we'll pretend I didn't say that.  Finally, you might see squirrels.  Because squirrels like law school.  I don't know why.  It's just something that's true for no reason.  [Coming up in chapter 2: How to Survive Class.  "Teachers look funny when they talk, don't they?  They look like aliens from the planet Zeptar.  Zeptar is in between Mars and Jupiter, but because it's full of scary aliens, they don't talk about it in school much..."]

      The Children's Guide to Law School: a work-in-progress  Introduction  You know how when Daddy's driving the car really fast and Mommy tells him to slow down or the police will come and give him a ticket?  You know how when Mommy says she's going to kill Daddy, she doesn't actually kill him for real?  You know how when you go out to a restaurant, Daddy isn't allowed to bring in his concealed handgun?*  Well, the reason for all of these things is that we live in a country where there are laws.  Laws tell people what they can and cannot do, kind of like Mommy does except when you dont listen to Mommy, all she does is lock you in a closet and hit you with a sharp stick.**  When you dont listen to laws, the police come and put you in jail.  And you dont want to go to jail.  Because they do bad things to little kids in jail.  (And on Michael Jacksons ranch, but thats a different book altogether.)  Anyway, this book is all about where people go when they want to learn the laws and help people stay out of jail  or help put people in jail who do bad things, think about doing bad things, or fit certain racial or ethnic profiles regardless of whether or not they did any bad things.  The place people go is called Law School.  And Law School is a lot like pre-school  theres lots of crying, and nobody likes to share.  Except instead of fingerpainting, students at Law School Shepardize.  Shepardizing is a trademark of the Lexis-Nexis corporation, which maintains a big computer database of all of the cases ever decided in court.  Court is where Uncle John went after he touched that pretty girl in the wrong place.  Lexis-Nexis is kind of like a big toy chest that you open up and discover its filled with lots and lots of horse manure.  But, if you dig through the horse manure often enough, Lexis-Nexis gives you prizes.  It sounds strange, I know.  But a lot of things about Law School are strange.  Like the people inside.  This book will teach you all about Law School and the strange things that happen there.  So come on board the flying toy chest filled with horse manure sponsored by our friends at Lexis and get ready for an exciting ride!  (*applicable only in Texas editions of the book) (**applicable only in Singapore editions of the book)

      Orientation Tips for getting off on the right foot with your law school classmates:  1. Make sure that whenever you introduce yourself, you also mention where you went to college, your GPA, LSAT score, and any honors or distinctions you may have received.  If you studied in England for any length of time, mention that twice.  Example: "Hi, I'm Sebastian Franklin IV.  I went to Yale, had a 4.2 GPA, and scored a 183 on the LSAT.  And I studied at Oxford for a year.  And I studied at Oxford for a year.  How about you?"  2. It is vital that you demonstrate your legal knowledge to your classmates immediately.  This way they will know how much more prepared you are for law school than they are, and they will therefore like you more.  Actually, this requires that before law school, you learn lots of names of cases and just enough detail about them to throw them into conversation regularly.  It's not important whether you have any real idea what you're talking about -- they won't know if you're wrong -- just that you sound informed.  For example, "You enjoy scuba diving?  Well, you had better be careful.  I'm sure you know that in the recent case of Davidson v. National Scuba Instructors, the Supreme Court of Newfoundland held that scuba instructors are not liable for injuries suffered using their equipment in a non-certified lake.  You see, the precedent in that case led the justices to assumpsit sua sponte linguini a priori per se reversed."  3. Whatever anyone else says he's done, you've done also, and even better.  This will furthur impress your classmates and let them know you'd be a good person to have in a study group.  "You say you've climbed Mount Everest?  Well, I built Mount Everest, and I own Mount Everest!"  4. Pretend you know everyone on the campus.  If you see random people walking by on the street, say hello.  Especially if they look distinguished.  This will demonstrate how well-connected you are and convince your classmates to give them their class notes on days you don't show up to class.  5. Pretend you know everyone in the world.  Whenever someone tells a story, you, of course, know someone who's done the same thing, or know someone involved in the story.  "Your friend went to a nightclub in New Delhi?  My friend manages a nightclub in New Delhi!  And once drove a rickshaw in Calcutta!"  6. Ask lots of questions.  Especially during activities that seem boring, like a library tour.  Having lots of questions will demonstrate your inquisitive mind and powerful critical thinking skills.   Your classmates will thank you for asking the questions they were just too shy to ask, but were wondering about nonetheless.  "The library books are listed in the order of their call numbers?  Or in alphabetical order?  And how many books are there?  Can we count them?  Can you show us the storage facility in the basement?"  7. Make fun of people behind their backs.  Nothing lets people know your sharp wit like making fun of your classmates when they aren't listening.  Mock the fat kid.  Joke about the woman with the bad haircut.  Imitate the guy with a lisp.  It's all hilarious.  And guaranteed to make you friends.  After all, conventional wisdom says lawyers are generally unpleasant people.  So why not start acting like a lawyer right away?  8. Tear pages from important library books.  You may have heard the rumors that this goes on at law school.  Well, maybe it doesn't, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't take it upon yourself to bring back a tradition from the days when people were cutthroat and generally uncivil towards each other.  Put the "awful" back in "lawful" by doing things designed exclusively to hamper the progress of others and give yourself an unfair advantage.  You'll soon find it's fun to be cruel!  9. Suck up to your professors.  There's nothing your classmates will like more than someone who rushes up to the professor's desk after every class and compliments him on a great lecture.  Or uses the entire office hour time period to ask the professor what she thinks about the latest Supreme Court decision that has nothing to do with the subject matter of the course.  This will show your classmates that you think you're special, and everyone loves special people.

      "You know you've been at law school too long when..."   ...a 700-page book ("An Unfinished Life," by Robert Dallek -- about JFK -- in case you're curious) seems like easy reading.  ...you start saying things like, "while the language bears that out, there's a social utility argument..."  ...you're trying to put together a study group to help you figure out the best strategy for getting a seat on the subway in the early morning commute.  Which reminds me...  Three ways to get a seat on even the most crowded NY subway car:  1. Sneeze on the person sitting where you want to sit. 2. Use a walker. 3. Borrow someone's baby and bring her along.

      I just happened to be looking at a can of Glade air freshener, and it says for questions and concerns, call an 800 number "or write Helen Johnson."  Now who is this Helen Johnson woman, and (1) don't you think it's a bit overwhelming to place all of the burdens of answering people's air freshener concerns on one person? and (2) what if she quits?  Also, I noticed that Glade is made by the SC Johnson Company.  So is it possible that Helen Johnson is in fact the loser family member who, instead of getting to run her own product line, or fly in the corporate jet, or make new air freshener scents whenever she gets so inspired, is forced to answer consumer mail?  Isn't that a little insulting to poor Helen?  Or, is it possible, and I think this is the most likely truth, that there is no "Helen Johnson" but the marketing folks over at Glade think it'll make the naive American public feel better if they think they're writing to a person and not a corporate bureaucracy where it's not the lovely and delightful Helen, but 17-year-old summer intern Spike who's answering their mail.  (See all the inspiration for posts I can squeeze out of my summer job?)

      Thought I'd tune in to the Yankees-Tigers game today to watch Roger Clemens get his 300th win.  Six hours, a nap, 14 pitchers, and 3 inning-ending double plays hit into by the Yankees' Juan Rivera later, Yankees won 10-9 in 17 innings.  No 300th win for Clemens.  Yankees pitchers threw 246 pitches (Detroit's were ever so slightly more economical at 243), so his arm may have fallen off had they left him in to finish it.  :)

      A post on  urlLink Waddling Thunder  about law firm prestige inspires me to add my thoughts.     [big blank space]     Those are my thoughts.  Seriously, I have nothing of any value to say about law firm prestige.  A spam e-mail from Vault told me they'd released new law firm rankings, and some time spent with the free Vault access that Harvard's career services office has* didn't really help much.  I have no doubt that Vault is ranking >something why  But unlike college (or law school), not everyone leaves their first firm to get another job, especially not one in another law firm or legal-related endeavor, so I think the rankings probably must have less of an impact on what people should do when choosing, just because it really may not matter, and lifestyle/location/area of practice/all sorts of other factors are important, and can surely matter more than a firm's rank.  Like I promised, I've just said nothing of any real value.  From reading the Vault stuff, I've figured out that there a number of dimensions on which law firms seem to differ, and a number of dimensions on which they seem not to.  Dimensions on which they seem not to differ much: >Salary >Dress code Monday through Thursday >Lavish summer programs >Health insurance  Dimensions on which they seem to differ a bit: >Dress code on Friday >Dental and vision insurance >The existence of a subsidized cafeteria >Practice groups >"Face time" -- the mysterious concept that keeps you from leaving the office early if you have nothing to do; but I wonder if the existence of "face time" at some firms is exaggerated, and the lack of it at other firms is exaggerated as well.  I just don't know. >Internal staircase :)  This is not that helpful for making any sort of decisions.  Clearly.  And so the investigation continues.  * = I didn't realize I got free Vault access until three hours after I ordered the book online.  They wouldn't let me cancel my order.  I paid $35 plus $6 tax, shipping, and handing.  So if anyone wants the brand new, 744-page Vault top 100 law firm rankings book, in untouched condition, I'll sell it to you for $30 and save you a few bucks, and I won't charge you any shipping (or handling!), because I'm more comfortable eating $11 than eating $41, and figure someone out there *must* want the book.  So  urlLink e-mail me  if you want the book.  First one who e-mails me gets it, and I'll delete this little paragraph after I have a taker.

      "How to Excel at Law Firm Job Interviews," by the National Association of Late-Night Telemarketers  Interviewer: Why should we hire you?  You: Why?  Here's why.  Three words.  Speed, versatility, and value.  First: speed.  Most employees operate on only one speed.  But the law-o-matic 3000 -- I mean, me -- I operate on twelve speeds.  Blend, grate, chop, dice, mix, stir, shake, whip, grind, pulverize, atomize, and demolish.  Fully adjustable, voice-activated, wireless, carbon-based, no need for expensive batteries, runs quietly, automatic shut-off, won't cost you hundreds of dollars in electric bills, and hardly spills.  Second: versatility.  Some employees just do one thing, like file.  But the Law Lion Millennium Edition is like twenty-three lawyers in one.  It files, faxes, reads, writes, copies, types, phones, e-mails, conferences, memos, briefs, argues, revises, submits, researches, staples, clips, binds, records, notarizes, alphabetizes, Shepardizes, and bills accurately -- all without clumsy attachments, small easy-to-swallow parts, tangled cords, expensive accessories, hard-to-replace filters, wasteful pulp and seeds, breakable handles, dangerous sharp edges, or addictions to Internet porn.  Third: value.  Comparable lawyers often sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars, and require expensive moving allowances, signing bonuses, bar fees, and more.  But if you hire me today, I can be yours for just fifty-two easy payments of $2404.  That's right, just fifty-two easy payments of $2404.  Plus, if you act within the next thirty minutes, I'll bring my own stapler, give up the dental plan, and proofread your web site -- a three hundred dollar value!  Free, if you act now.  Operators are standing by, laptop and Blackberry not included.  Interviewer: Well, can you explain the C on your transcript?  You: Yes, the C was an unfortunate bug in our prior model, the Law-o-Saurus 500X.  We've retired that version and replaced it with the brand new Law-o-Saurus Deluxe XP, and the bug that caused the C has been fixed.  Interviewer: How about your LSAT score?  Can you explain that?  You: In independent tests performed by our non-partisan institute, the Law School Admissions Council-o-Matic Deluxe Special Edition, I have consistently scored between 175 and 180.  I see no evidence that the "official" version as administered has any greater validity than our own independent tests, validated by a man in a white coat, and another man who wears glasses.  Crash tests have also shown that I can withstand a pressure equivalent to that of three hiring partners standing on my back and yelling profanities at me.  Interviewer: Am I reading your resume right -- it says one of your interests is placing small ads in local newspapers, and somehow turning them into a consistently weekly cash flow of up to $50,000, results may vary?  You: That's right.  I also buy and sell real estate from my home, with no money down, and earn seven-figure profits using an easy five-step plan anyone can follow on the path to Easy Street.  Interviewer: And you used to weigh 500 pounds.  You: Indeed.  But with a healthy shake for breakfast, one for lunch, and a sensible bowl of leaves for dinner, I've been able to take off the weight -- and keep it off! -- without pills, laxatives, suppositories, vomiting, untested herbal supplements, artificial drugs, natural flavors, food coloring, invasive surgery, electroshock therapy, psychotropic medications, fish food, fatal illness, or brussels sprouts.  Interviewer: Thanks.  Just to finish up, do you have any questions for us?  You: Actually, I do.  How would you like to turn your messy closets into neat, organized works of art, without expensive construction, backbreaking labor, or magic potions?  Interviewer: Hmm... That does sound useful... You're hired!

      This is not making a political point at all, don't worry.  It's just a sketch.  Enjoy.  President Clinton, September 25, 1997: All of us should embrace the vision of a colorblind society but recognize the fact that we are not there yet.  (Lights up on an intersection.  A pregnant woman begins to cross the street.  A truck comes barreling down the road, and barely swerves to miss her.  She is shaken.  The driver pulls over and gets out of the truck to see if she is okay.)  DRIVER: Are you okay, maam?  Im terribly sorry but you shouldnt be crossing against the light.  WOMAN: Against the light?  The light is red!  You nearly ran me over trying to run a red light.  DRIVER: Run a red light?  No, maam.  The light was green.  (An elderly man walks by.)  ELDERLY MAN: The light was yellow, folks.  Get your eyes checked.  DRIVER: Get your ears checked, old man.  We werent talking to you.  ELDERLY MAN: Look, if you want me to exit your scene, you dont have to get nasty about it.  Just tell me to go, and Ill go.  (He exits.)  WOMAN: I do think its possible my baby may have been a bit shaken up by the incident back there.  DRIVER: Good thing Ive got some fix-the-shaken-baby powder in my truck.  Ill go get it.  (He goes to his truck.  He comes out with two large boxes.  One is bright green with big red letters that say Baby Poison.  One is bright red with big green letters that say Fix- the-Shaken-Baby Powder.)  DRIVER: I know its one of these two boxes.  I just cant tell which one.  WOMAN: Me neither.  I have no idea.  Theyre both blank.  And kind of gray.  (Elderly man comes by again.)  ELDERLY MAN: Its the box on the right.  The other ones poison.  Get your eyes checked.  DRIVER: Get your prostate checked, old man.  We werent talking to you.  ELDERLY MAN: Fine, fine.  But Im getting the same actors equity paycheck as you whether or not you let me in your scene, so it dont bother me one bit to sit in the dressing room while you take one joke and turn it into a whole scene.  Young people.  Never know when to quit.  (He exits.)  WOMAN: Youve been very nice to me since you almost hit me, sir.  I was wondering if youd like to come see a football game with me.  DRIVER: Perhaps.  Whos playing?  WOMAN: The Washington Redskins and the Green Bay Packers.  DRIVER: Oh, Im afraid Im going to have to pass.  I can never tell those two teams apart by their uniforms.  WOMAN: Yes, I have the same problem.

      Some  urlLink ramblings from a soon-to-be-1L  on how he's worried about balancing law and life.  I think even just acknowledging that there's a work/life balance to think about, regardless of where you come down in terms of a decision, that's still more perspective than a lot of people have.  Good stuff.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  takes me to task for taking him to task about being upset he didn't make law review.  And he's right.  I didn't mean to say ambition's bad, and that it's bad to care about stuff like making law review, or a businessman with lots caring about making his next million dollars, or Barry Bonds caring about hitting yet another home run.  He wouldn't be in law school if he hadn't cared about stuff like that all along.  And just because the prestigious law-related accomplishments people can attain aren't what drive me personally, it's not fair for me to say they shouldn't drive anyone.  And, really, it makes a lot more sense for people to be driven by that stuff, given that we're in law school, than to be driven by stuff like whether people like my writing and think it's funny.  So I take it back, and in fact I think it's probably good that cares -- if I'm hiring a lawyer, I want him to care that he didn't make law review, and strive in his professional career to show that he should have.  It probably makes for a better lawyer.

      I used to think there was a moment in life when it all clicked, when it all just came together, and you were a fully self-actualized adult, immune from worry and fear, immune from insecurities and self-doubt, immune from the hazards of day-to-day life.  I'm starting to realize it's more of a gradual process not of getting rid of all that stuff but of learning to deal with it, and understand that some things are important, some things aren't, and most stuff isn't worth getting all that upset about.  I don't understand drivers who get really mad when someone cuts them off.  After all, there's no one on the road who *wants* to get into an accident, and it seems pretty darn amazing to me that we drive around at 60 miles an hour in big steel boxes and there are as few accidents as there are.  So everyone's just trying the best they can.  And when someone cuts me off, I'm happy to let them in, mostly in the hope that the karmic bonus I get for being polite will be returned when I accidentally miss something in my blind spot and start to make an ill-advised lane change.  The reason why I write this.  I was going to post something like, "I'm sorry  urlLink Waddling Thunder  didn't make law review."  But then I realized, with apologies to Waddling Thunder, that I'm really not that sorry.  And this isn't a comment about law review, it's just a comment about what matters and what doesn't.  He admits he knows it, intellectually, that this won't really change the course of his life and probably won't turn out to matter.  But he feels bad because it feels bad to get beaten by other people at something you think you're good at.  I understand all that, and, yeah, I guess I am sorry for him that he didn't make it, but if Harvard Law students are still relying on external academic validation, the world is in trouble.

      I went to a law firm recruiting reception tonight, held at the firm's gorgeous offices overlooking one of Washington's most beautiful structures.  I'm trying not to give the name of the firm away, so I'll be somewhat coy about what it's overlooking.  It was very nice.  Nice hors d'oeuvres, nice people, beautiful building, magnificent terrace, gorgeous view.  Met some people in my law school class I didn't know before, and that was very nice.  Met some lawyers at this firm, who seemed as pleasant as any other lawyers I've ever met.  Noticed as we saw one guy's office that there weren't people still there working Friday night at 8:30.  From all accounts, it seemed like the people there really get along, really enjoy being with each other, don't take their work overly seriously, all look intelligent and pleasant, enjoy their jobs, have a work-life balance, all that good stuff.  I've written before about how I think it's probably a good idea for me to work at a firm next summer, so I can make an informed decision about what I want to do in the long-term, and so I can see what life at a firm is really like and not just make assumptions based on what you hear.  And if I wanted to work in Washington next summer, which I probably don't (I think it'll be New York -- or at least I hope it will, depending on the results of my interviews in the fall), this firm did everything to impress me and nothing to turn me away.  I did not so much like the mini sausage pockets.  But that alone will not turn me away.  Some might have preferred Coke products over Pepsi products.  But that ought not turn people away.  Some people may have wished the office overlooked a different beautiful Washington structure.  But they were doing pretty nicely as it is.

      Content, content, content!  Tonight I went to a Harvard Law School Alumni Association event here in DC -- a speech by the new law school dean, a chance to see some classmates in the area, and what they called "substantial hors d'oeurves."  I figured that if I took a substantial amount of the substantial hors d'oeuvres, I'd be in good shape to save a substantial amount of money on dinner.  And two chicken skewers, five mini crab cakes, two mini mushroom things, a piece of mini bread, two mini cubes of cheese, a tiny little piece of smoked salmon, a cracker, a mini egg roll, and, inadvertently, three toothpicks, I'm pretty full.  Mission accomplished.  The event was pretty crowded -- perhaps 300 people, ranging in age from "in their 20s" to "born in the '20s."  There were a bunch of incoming 1Ls there -- I'm guessing the admissions people notified the people who got accepted of these events, and urged them to show up.  I feel a little bad for the one '06er who I ended up talking to for a little bit, just because I clearly wasn't the law school representative he was looking for.  HIM: "So, I see from your nametag you were just a 1L.  Did you like it?" ME: "Yeah, yeah, I really did." HIM: "So what are you doing for the summer?" ME: "[brief explanation of my summer split between two really non-legal jobs, relying for the tenth time this evening on the soundbite I practiced beforehand about my current job]" HIM: "It's that hard to get a law firm job for the summer?"  [If I'd tried to get a firm job this summer, I think that would have been mildly offensive.  But, no, at that point I simply started to realize what I have to say is of no interest to this guy.  Nevertheless...]  ME: "I didn't actually try.  I'm happy with what I got." HIM: "And they have to do with law school -- how?" ME: "They don't." HIM: "Why not?" ME: "Because I thought I'd try some stuff I'm really interested in." HIM: "Did most people find it as hard as you did to get a law firm job this summer?" ME: "Uh -- I didn't try.  But a lot of people did, and some got jobs." HIM: "At bad firms?" ME: "Excuse me?" HIM: "At bad firms." ME: "I don't know what the difference is.  Some got jobs with firms they really want to work at after graduation.  And some went to second-tier cities." HIM: "Like?" ME: "I don't know.  Columbus, St. Louis, Juneau." HIM: "Juneau?" ME: "No, I'm kidding." HIM: "I don't want to be a Supreme Court Clerk." ME: "Okay..." HIM: So I can probably just squeak by and still get a law firm job? ME: That's what I hear. HIM: Great. ME: Great. HIM: Is there anyone here you know who's working at firm this summer?" ME: Yes.  And then he kind of drifted away.  I feel bad I failed him in his quest to get some dirt on firms.  I had a small bout of uncontrollable laughter at one point during the Q&A session with the Dean.  Someone asked a question, which us young folks in the back couldn't hear, and she repeated what he'd asked: "The question -- the questioner said he's a trans---"  And at this point my brain filled in the rest of the word, and I thought it was really funny.  Obviously, the rest of the word wasn't "vestite."  It was "actional attorney."  And that's much less funny.  Tomorrow I'm going to a recruiting reception for a fairly high-profile law firm, hoping for more free food and perhaps a pen or t-shirt.  I'll keep you posted... :)

      Good stuff over at  urlLink Ambivalent Imbroglio , the weblog of a 1L-to-be-very-soon.  The post I'm linking to is a response to my post from this past Saturday, where I wrote about how I liked being a student, and if that's part of the reason I'm at law school... well... maybe that's okay.  I've since edited that post down a bit, so the version quoted over there may not quite match what I've still got below... but the insights over there at AI are interesting.  Basically, the point being made is that school helps you build a better life for yourself, so it's not a waste of time, even if it ends up being a waste of time.  Or something like that.  So I thought I'd flag it.  Also because it says nice things about me.  :)

      I got an e-mail from a reader last night, asking what I thought was an interesting question.  He's concerned because even though he's going to a top-notch law school in the fall, he went to a less prestigious undergrad, and he's wondering if his job prospects will be affected at all because his undergrad wasn't a "name" school, and if he's wasting his money on the expensive law school when he won't be able to get the good jobs it positions students for anyway.  I really don't know the answer (career services has never mentioned it as far as I recall, and I don't think I've ever heard anyone talk about it), but it's an interesting question.  Here's my intuition:  Where he's going is a selective school.  For him to have gotten accepted there, there must be something he did that overcomes any liability that he may have based on where he went to undergrad.  Because prestige of undergrad obviously matters in law school admissions quite a bit.  Law firms, from what I understand, look at the prestige of your law school, and they look at law school grades (and they do lots of interviews, and there's other factors I'm sure).  But if I'm a hiring partner at a law firm, and I see that someone's first year grades are as good or better than his classmate who went to Yale for undergrad, I don't think I'd have any good reason to hold his less-prestigious undergrad against him -- clearly, the law school liked him enough to admit him, and now that he's there, he's doing as well or better than this other guy.  Why would I hire the other guy instead -- this guy's doing better, at the same school.  So my intuition is that if someone does decently okay, it shouldn't matter. Maybe, maybe, maybe if you do really poorly -- maybe then a firm would use your undergrad to say to themselves that you didn't belong at the law school to begin with, and they'd be more likely to think that than of your classmate from Yale.  Maybe.  But if you do really poorly, it's harder to get a job anyway -- whether you went to Yale or to Joe's Crab Shack and 4-Year College & Seafood Breadery (I hope that's not actually where this guy went -- I'd feel bad poking fun at it).  But I have no idea if I'm right on the money, or if I'm giving out a bad answer to a good question.  Although, "bad answers to good questions" could be an awfully compelling idea for a syndicated newspaper column.  Or something in The Onion.  Q: "I was adopted and want to find out my birth parents.  How do I go about doing that?"  A: "Thanks for the good question.  Here's a bad answer. Open the phone book, and, starting with the first entry, call everyone whose name sounds female, and ask them if they ever gave someone up for adoption.  Here's another bad answer.  Go to a psychic and ask her to conjure the name for you.  Here's a third bad answer..."

      I saw a terrific movie last night.   urlLink Spellbound  (the link is to the Denver Post review, which is the most worthy-of-being-linked review I can find), a documentary about eight competitors in the National Spelling Bee.  I know, it sounds awful.  But it's absolutely captivating.  It's eight mini-documentaries about the kids, but almost as much about their parents -- some simply in awe of their children, some wishing they'd go to the mall more instead of studying lists of words, and some pushing, and pushing, and pushing.  In part, it's a story of the struggles of being a "smart kid."  It's wrenching to see these kids standing up at the microphone, after hours upon hours upon hours of studying, one wrong letter away from hearing the ding of the bell and being eliminated.  I don't want to give anything away.  I just want to convince you to see this movie.  Funny, suspenseful, fascinating.  Great stuff.  But maybe it's just me.  Maybe I just identified more, because of my own, albeit very low-level and not particularly dramatic, spelling bee story: in fourth grade I won my school spelling bee, and went on to the district.  I don't know if it was the first round, the second round, I have no idea -- but I was given the word "halibut."  The fish.  Like at age 9, I'd been to a fish store.  And the guy pronounced it kind of weird (actually, this is probably my imagination -- he probably pronounced it perfectly correctly) -- sounded like "hal-ih-biht" to me -- so I spelled it with an "i" instead of a "u," and that was the end of my spelling bee career.  And the winning word in the district bee?  "Refrigerator."  Like any self-respecting 9-year-old speller can't spell refrigerator?    I'm not bitter.  But I've never, ever, ever eaten halibut.  And I never will.  :)

      Okay, my curiosity has been piqued.  There's a thread on the Princeton Review law school discussion board where a hiring partner at a top firm is taking questions and giving his answers.  He responded to one person that he Googles everyone before he interviews them.  I'm sure there's at least a handful of lawyers who read this occasionally -- does the mere existence of my weblog put a real dent in my chances during the recruiting season?  Or does the fact that someone might find it entertaining balance the risk that someone else might see it as a negative?  At this point I'm merely curious.  Any thoughts, shoot me an  urlLink e-mail ...

      I know I've read something about this before, perhaps on Waddling Thunder's weblog a long while back, but nevertheless -- one of the stops on the DC metro line I take to work is called "Judiciary Square."  Yet none of the "conductors" (the people who announce the stops) seem at all able to pronounce it properly.  And it's never the same twice.  Among the variations I've heard:  Judishooary Square Judisharary Square J'dasharooney Square Dupont Circle Federal Triangle Pentagon Octagon  Actually, come to think of it, the DC metro is pretty well-covered when it comes to stops named after polygons.  The other funny DC metro thing that's happened is that a train got stuck at one of the poorer-named stops, "Foggy Bottom."  Leading to the following announcements:  "There's a train lodged in Foggy Bottom." "We'll be moving shortly, after they get the train unstuck from Foggy Bottom." "There's a backup in Foggy Bottom.  We'll be moving as soon as we can." "There's a line of trains waiting to get up into Foggy Bottom." "We apologize for the odor in Foggy Bottom.  That train was stuck there an awful long time."  (Okay, they didn't really say that one.)

      Just saw a commercial for "Who Wants To Marry My Dad?" a new reality show that takes over the "Meet My Folks" time slot.  And they just keep coming.  Finding true love.  Variations on this theme have spawned, what, two dozen, three dozen reality shows?  There's the "dating" set -- Love Connection, Blind Date, Love Cruise, Dismissed; the "pick from a bunch of suitors" set -- Bachelor, Joe Millionaire, Mr. Personality, For Love or Money; the "lots of people on a beach" set -- Temptation Island, Paradise Island; and the "stuff involving parents" set -- Meet My Folks and now Who Wants To Marry My Dad.  Animal Planet should have Who Wants To Marry My Dog, the Bestiality Network: Who Wants To Marry My Horse, and, well, probably Fox will have "Who Wants To Marry My Deformed and Awfully Unpleasant Mutant Goat-Child For The Chance To Be On National TV?"  In more law-related pop-culture news, I saw Legally Blonde 2 today.  A few inconsistencies in the otherwise true-to-life film: (1) Harvard Law School classrooms don't really look like that, (2) Harvard Law School professors wouldn't be interested in something as mundane as the Red Sox, and (3) it is virtually inconceivable that Elle Woods could have graduated from law school and not have some clue that sometimes lawyers don't do the "right" thing, especially if they have paying clients whose best interests lie elsewhere.  Other than that, not a single bit of fiction in the movie.  Except for maybe the part where, as a new staffer, she gets to talk in front of the whole Congress.  Maybe.  And don't worry, I really haven't spoiled anything for you here.  Really, I promise.

      I'm pretty sure I've covered this ground before, but not for a while.  Probably the hardest thing about the two years I worked before going to law school was that being on my own, being in a new city, having a job and an apartment -- it all meant I had to really make a life for myself.  And I realized that without doing anything pro-active, it's easy to end up going to work, coming home, going to sleep, repeat, sleep and run errands on the weekends, and not really have much of a life.  It's on your own shoulders to make plans, find activities, make friends, do things -- in a way that it's not at school.  Because at school you have classes and extracurriculars, and friends, and things to read and write and study, and purpose and meaning, and all that jazz...    And so I hate thinking that one of the reasons I'm in law school is because I like going to school, and because I like the lifestyle of being a student, and that I find all of this easier than making a life for myself.  Because thinking it kind of makes me feel like I'm just postponing the inevitable, or that I'm wasting time and money...    But if it's not one of the reasons I'm in school, it's at least one of the side benefits.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  writes some thought-provoking thoughts (i don't think that's redundant, actually) on Malcolm Gladwell's bestselling book,  The Tipping Point .  I read the book a few years ago after finding it on a bargain table for $2.99, and enjoyed it very much.  It's interesting -- how new things become cultural phenomena.  Like, for example, the Howard Dean campaign for President -- it seems to be building momentum, but is it enough to push it over the tipping point?  Or is it just a fad that will soon fade?  I hope it's the [former/latter -- insert whichever one corresponds to your own political beliefs, so that I don't alienate any readers with my radically right-wing/left-wing/moderate views].  Expanding on that idea -- I wonder how the tipping point relates to weblogs.  What is the threshhold for when a weblog all of a sudden jumps from, say, 40 visitors a day, to 200, or 2,000, or 20,000.  I can't imagine it's a gradual thing; it's got to be exponential -- a particularly striking post that visitors forward to their friends, who forward to their friends, and so on.  Who are, in tipping point language, the "connectors" that need to read the weblog before it becomes a cultural phenomenon.  And what does that post have to be?  How can one website find that tipping point given the vastness of the Internet?  A side note that was originally the reason for my post -- the guy whose apartment I'm subletting actually has a copy of the Tipping Point on his shelf.  Sort of.  He has the audiobook version.  I have a problem with audiobooks.  I mean, I understand their convenience, and why people might want to listen to them -- on a long commute, etc -- but there's pleasure in reading, so much more than listening.  And somehow reading seems like a much more beneficial activity.  We don't tell kids to go up to their room and listen to audiobooks when they're little because it'll make them smart.  Yet more than once, I've been in a conversation with a friend, and a book will come up, and they'll say, "Oh, I read that" and later in the conversation they say they listened to the audio book.  Yet they feel okay calling that "reading."  It's not reading any more than I can watch a video on MTV (i mean MTV2 -- there are no videos on MTV) and say "I sang that."  It's a totally different activity.  Reading does not equal listening to the audio book version.  Unless I'm wrong.  Unless it does, and this transformation of what it means to read has passed me by, much like the mp3 player and high-definition television, and minidiscs.  Speaking of minidiscs -- the stream of consciousness rant that never ends!! -- why do we have such an urge to always make things smaller?  CDs are not so big.  Or cell phones.  Isn't it getting a little ridiculous now?  They're pretty darn small yet they're getting smaller.  The distance between my ear and my mouth isn't.  Yet the phone is.  And it's doing more stuff.  I like my gadgets to do one thing, but do it well.  If you're a cell phone, I want you to let me make calls.  I don't need solitaire, web browsing, schedule-making, pez dispensing, or food dehydrating. Just let me make a phone call without losing service all the time.

      Received an e-mail with dormitory regulations for the upcoming year.  Permit me the luxury of making fun of some of this stuff:  >PLEASE NOTE - ITEMS ABSOLUTELY NOT ALLOWED IN DORM ROOMS: Pets, cooking appliances and halogen lamps  (Also, firearms and dangerous weapons are not allowed on campus).  OK, so compared to pets, cooking appliances, and halogen lamps, FIREARMS and WEAPONS get placed in parentheses.  NO FISH, and, by the way, just in case you were wondering, also maybe no nuclear missiles too...  >Your mailing address and telephone number was included in the confirmation for your dorm room.   (Please save this information where you will not lose it and give the information to people who may wish to contact you).    Wait a second.  You mean that if someone wants to contact us, we should give them our address and phone number?  Really?  And we should not just save it -- but save it specifically in a place where we won't lose it.  OK, I think I understand now.  >Law School students bringing a car to campus compete with other graduate school students for parking spots.    Like in an Olympics?  OK, now I'm just being a pain.  There's really nothing wrong with this sentence, it's obvious what it means... but, on the other hand, it might be fun to have a parking spot Olympics with other graduate school students.  We could have the rope-guarding-the-grass vault, and the library carrel hurdles, and the biathlon: reading combined with writing.  That might be fun!

      The last 800 words about grades (for now)  With a year of grades in hand (not literally in hand  Im working from memory here), the sample size is clearly large enough that I can draw some conclusions:  1. I do better in classes with the smaller red casebooks than the bigger brown casebooks.  Next step is to check which casebooks my scheduled 2L classes are using and add/drop accordingly.  2. I do about the same in classes where the professor wrote the casebook as in classes where the professor did not read the casebook.  3. My pass/fail first-year lawyering grades have no correlation with any other grades, except that the letter P sort of looks like the letter B if you hide one of the lumps of the B.  4. To best maximize the trends I have discovered, I should probably take classes from female professors who are losing their hair.  5. I do either better or worse in classes where I make my own outline versus classes where I dont.  6. I may or may not do best in classes where we have a paper option, but since I havent had any of those yet, I have no way of drawing any conclusions.  7. At first I thought that the plus and minus signs next to the letters meant something about the grades, but a careful regiment of yoga and hypnosis have convinced me otherwise.  Also, D looks like A if you have cataracts.  8. Not showing up to an exam, although not yet accounted for in the sample, would seem to be a poor strategy, given that for the exams I did okay on, I showed up 100% of the time.  9. I also showed up 100% of the time to the exams I did less okay on, so it is unclear whether showing up is indeed a grade-maximizing strategy.  10. Lists always look better when there are ten items than nine, but Ive run out of things to say.  11. Lists look even better with eleven items.  12. But not twelve.  The real challenge that getting grades provided was calculating my GPA.  Since my one spring elective was only 3 credits, and the 1L required courses were all 5 credits, it took some work.  Also complicated by Harvards odd GPA calculation system.  In two ways:  First, contrary to expectations, a three-credit class isnt worth three-fifths of a five-credit class.  Its worth half.  And a four-credit class is worth three-quarters.  I dont think Im making this up.  Unless someone was lying to me when they told me.  A two-credit class is worth seven times what a five-credit class is worth, and for a one-credit class, you raise e to the power of your grade, divide by pi, and take the square root of an imaginary number.  Then you go to math graduate school for 7 years, earn a PhD, and then, finally, you can maybe calculate your GPA.  But then you need to convert it from Metric to Fahrenheit using a microwave.  Second, Harvard uses an 8-point scale.  A+ is 8, A is 7, A- is 6, B+ is 5, B is 4, B- is 3 wait, Im running out of numbers C is 2, D is 1, F is 0?  Maybe?  D- is 0.5.  F+ is 0.0001.  B++ is about 5.42.  A++ is infinity, which, even in a three-credit class, can radically change the overall GPA.  I can only think of one reason to use an 8 point GPA, besides to confuse people (okay, that makes two reasons).  Its all part of Harvards sinister plan to take over the world.  You see, even if people arent swayed by the prestige of a Harvard degree, surely a 5.3 GPA is enough to make them swoon.  A 6.25?  The job is yours.  Even straight Bs  a 4.0!  youre top of the class.  We all are.  Those extra numbers on the GPA scale are part of what our tuition dollars pay for.    I wonder if people actually do list these 8-point-scale GPA numbers on resumes.  Quite a leap between undergrad and law school, you pretty young future trophy wife, an interviewer treading awfully close to sexual harassment might say to a female candidate.  From a 3.9 to a 5.8.  Thats quite remarkable.  Especially for a woman with your  shall we say  attributes, that same interviewer might say as they dragged him off to white-collar prison for sexually assaulting that other law student last interview season.  But regardless of whether someone's GPA is a 7.2, a 3.6, or a 1.2, my classmates and I finally have our grades.  So we all can sleep easy now, worried only about where the heck were going to work for the rest of our lives.  Yep, getting grades solved all of our problems.  But at least I know not to take any classes taught by Swedish toddlers.  Ive never done well in any of them.

      I should just go to sleep and get my full 8 hours.  But no, I'm gonna type instead.  A word of advice to law students starting to think about summer jobs and unaccustomed to warmer climates.  Stay away.  Doesn't matter what firm, find a satellite office closer to the arctic circle.  Because this is brutal.  Not only do the normal standards of the working world require clothing totally inappropriate for weather that approaches 90 degrees, humid and sunny on a cool day, but our bodies ain't built for this.  If I was smart, I'd bring a change of clothes just for the 10 minute walk from the subway stop, as I trek into a baffling corner of Washington that, while rich with Starbucks (which, if they serve any drinks that are heated at these locations, is clearly being run by buffoons) has been deemed unfit for metro stations.  So I walk, and I walk, and I sweat, and I sweat, and I get to work, half-melted, and I'm already ready for a nap.  And this lunch hour that has no choice but to be in the middle of the day, when the sun is at its peak, leaves me wandering the streets of DC, wishing for a sidewalk smoothie vendor or better yet a thunderstorm, hoping that the direction I choose to explore toady will yield quick food and not long journey.  This is why people at DC firms can be so productive -- no one can leave the office, for fear of heatstroke.  Even at its worst it is simply not this hot in New York, or buildings block the sun, or subway stations are nearer to each other, or cold people give off cold air, I don't know.  But I do know that it's hot out, and this is why people should not take summer jobs in Washington.  Consider yourself warned.  Go to Alaska instead (I know someone who did, and he sends me reports of fresh seafood and majestic scenery).  Or Iceland.  Or Greenland.  But if you must -- and you shouldn't (Even for governmnet work -- go to Ottawa instead!) -- at least make sure to find an apartment with air conditioning.  And a haiku:  Air conditioning Never heard two words so sweet Well, maybe ice cream

      I went to get a sandwich for lunch, just at a take-out sandwich place, no big deal, and the woman on line in front of me ordered 3 sandwiches, I guess for her whole office or something.  She gets to the cashier, the cashier asks her what she got, and she tells them only one of the three sandwiches.  She pays them $5.  Then they give her her bag, with three sandwiches.  And they say there's no such thing as a free lunch.  What's especially devious is that this woman isn't just getting free sandwiches -- she'll go back to work and give the food to her co-workers, and they'll pay her.  So she's getting free money.  Ten Really Terrible 10-Second Law Firm Interview Answers To The Question, "How Do You Like Law School?" 1. "I don't.  At all." 2. "Except for my awful grades, it's been great." 3. "It's been surprisingly good, given that I'm one of the stupidest people in the class." 4. "Oh, I wouldn't really know.  I hardly ever go to class." 5. "I like law school so much I never, ever, ever want to leave." 6. "It's been great for helping me figure out how to get away with crimes I've committed, or am planning to commit in the future, especially in the office of whatever law firm hires me." 7. "Excuse me?  I don't think that's an appropriate question and I'm going to have to report this as an incident of sexual harassment." 8. "It's made me really hate the law and dismiss any notion of actually practicing law anytime in the future." 9. "I like everything about it except how the loans I'm taking out will force me to take a job I will be sure to dislike so much that I sabotage the firm I'm working for and cause them endless grief and trouble." 10. "I'd been liking it just fine, until this interview started and you began talking."

      New day, new city.  Splitting my summer between two jobs.  Was in New York.  Am now in DC.  And it is hot here.  I have a 10-minute walk from where I get off the metro to get to my office.  And I was soaking wet.  And couldn't figure out how the buzzer on the outside of the door worked, but that's besides the point.  I eventually got in, and got settled, and got a key card for tomorrow.  Fun, fun, fun.  Baseball's All-Star Game last night made me think of a cool law-related idea for a reality TV show (on Court TV, I guess).  Lawyer Showdown.  Basically a professional's version of moot court.  You get two superstar lawyers (the superstars part is what came out of the All-Star Game -- I realize as I type this that there's very litttle connection here to the All-Star Game.  But I will not be deterred) and assign them to argue for and against some legal thing -- liability of McDonalds for obesity cases, pain and suffering limitations, OJ Simpson's guilt or innocence -- and have a panel of C-list celebrities, or, in the alternative, a studio audience, pick the winner.  Winner gets some obscene amount of money to make it all worthwhile, Court TV gets a cult hit.  Or maybe not.  OK, now a song parody.    "Our Lawyer's Here To Stay" (to the tune of George Gershwin's "Our Love Is Here To Stay")  It's very clear, our lawyer's here to stay Not for a year, but forever and a day He signed a contract, for a salary, that will make his lifestyle rise To where he can't afford to, say his firm goodbyes  Oh, partner, dear, our lawyer's here to stay Together we're billing a long, long day In time his marriage may crumble His happiness tumble As he grows old and gray But our lawyer's here to stay  Oh, partner, dear, our lawyer's here to stay The takeout meals, will add to the pounds he'll weigh As he grows bitter and lonely We will be the only He's never gonna stray Oh, our lawyer's here to stay Our lawyer's here to stay

Man that test was hard Questions made no sense to me Good thing I cheated  The teacher read this? I don't think he did because I ought not have passed  Did you get a B? Yes? I feel much better now No? I hope you die  Which semester's grades? They're running three behind now Not on their term bills  1Ls -- want my notes? You're more than welcome to them Won't tell you my grade!  Employers: they care But all they see is first year Then they don't matter  One dumb professor Turned in all his grades on time His colleagues shot him

      Like my colleague  urlLink Waddling Thunder , I (finally) got my spring grades today.  Like him, they're fine.  I'm still a law student.  :)  Like last semester, my prime complaint is that they mail them in such a thin envelope that before I open it, I know what it says.  So there's no way to make any ritual about it -- plus it's kind of annoying that probably at least one of the half-dozen postal employees who probably touched the envelope along its journey happened to catch a glimpse of the grades before I did.    My one observation of semi-consequence (but, then again, small sample size renders this point pretty much irrelevant) is that I was able to predict my grades with pretty solid accuracy (one grade differed by a third of a letter, but the other two were spot-on), so, at least for me, this semester, they don't feel particularly random or arbitrary.  But that could just be coincidence -- and who's to say my guesses were really anything more than random or arbitrary.  But enough about grades.  On Saturday, I posted about a hypothetical $1000 law school shopping spree and asked people to e-mail with their suggestions.  A weblog-record 3 (!) people e-mailed me their thoughts (that's not really a record.  I'm being sarcastic.).  And two of them (or "two of you," if you're the ones reading this), suggested an iPod.  $300 to move all of your music to a little travel thing you can use to ignore the world around you and/or avoid disturbing people who wish you wouldn't play your music so loud in the library.  One suggestion for 300-thread-count sheets (to go with the comfortable pillows I suggested).  Earplugs, concert tickets, eating out in nice restaurants, and alcohol were the other suggestions, all by Andrew Raff over at Brooklyn Law School, whose  urlLink weblog  I want to plug.  If you hate e-mail spam, but like Radiohead, you'll enjoy reading.  It's good stuff.  I had a fleeting thought as I received all three of these e-mails that I wonder if just about everyone who reads my weblog is someone with a weblog of his or her own, and that in fact the only people who read any of these weblogs are other people with weblogs, and we're all just amusing each other, with no influence at all in the world beyond our circle of weblogs.  Eh, even if that's the case, I'm still cool with it.  An audience of fellow webloggers is still an audience.  (And a fine audience at that...)

      I've gotten a couple of e-mails from people asking me if I've read "Brush With The Law," because they thought it was a great, super, fantastic, life-changing book.  And I did read it, last year before starting law school, and thought it was pretty absurd, a tale of people completely outside the mainstream of law school life, and completely foreign to anything I was at all likely to experience.  But thinking maybe I missed something, and would have a different perspective now that I've finished a year, I went back and read it again over the last few days.  And, while it's somewhat more interesting now that I know a lot of what the Harvard parts of the book (it's a dual memoir of someone at Stanford and someone at Harvard) are referring to and they have context for me, I still didn't think it came anywhere close to painting a realistic portrait of law school life for the vast majority of students -- unless there's this vast underground of illicit behavior that I'm too naive to know anything about.  Putting realism aside, I think the book would make a compelling movie and tells an interesting -- if depraved and worrisome -- story.  But as a guidebook to law school life, and a "must-read" for incoming 1Ls, sorry.  I don't think it's got a ton of value there.    What the authors try to get across is that it's possible to do virtually no work, attend few classes, and do well on exams solely through the use of other students' outlines, commercial study guides, and old exams.  And while those are useful tools, and you can probably swing decent grades if you're bright enough, you're pretty much throwing out your money and not learning all that much.  And some of what you learn is actually interesting, and class isn't really a bad thing.  I have no idea if there are people at law school who go to Foxwoods and gamble away their financial aid checks, or smoke crack every weekend, or anything else they describe in the book.  I don't know these people, and I don't want to know these people.  And there's the problem I have with the book -- maybe law school can be like that if you want it to, but why would anyone in their right mind want it to?

      Forget the pre-law preparation courses.  If you really have $1000 you want to spend on stuff that's going to make you a better and happier law student, here's my first take at what would be involved in the $1000 Law Student Quality-of-Life Shopping Spree.   urlLink E-mail me  with other suggestions and I'll post a follow-up in a few days.  1. Down pillows.  Comfortable pillows are so important.  For a good night's sleep, for something to lie on while reading casebooks, as a little piece of luxury you can give yourself even in the smallest of dorm rooms.  Personally, I have two awesome down pillows I got for $30 each at Bed, Bath and Beyond.  But with this hypothetical $1000, I think good pillows are so crucial that I'd probably trade up.  A quick Google search later, and I'm awfully impressed by the website over at  urlLink DeWoolfson Down .  Two pillows, $80 each.  $160 down (pun unintended, which makes it even better), $840 to go.  2. Wireless networking.  Seems cool.  I don't have it, but I bet it would be cool to be able to do Internet stuff from anywhere in your dorm, or outside, or in the library without plugging in, or in classrooms....  Obviously some schools are probably more wired than others for this.  Circuit City's web site surprises me how cheap it is to do this.   urlLink Home wireless kit.   On sale for $129.  $289 down, $711 to go.  3. A subscription to a magazine that will give you a half hour a week of something completely frivolous and non-law to read.  I prefer Entertainment Weekly, but pretty much anything except the Harvard Law Review will do.  Probably about $30.  $309 down, $691 to go.  4. Already running out of things.  See, I need your help.  Hmmm.  How about a selection of pleasant study music.  The 5 CDs that probably got the most play all of 1L year, in my CD player?  (Apologies if my musical tastes run frighteningly close to those of your parents)  James Taylor's Hourglass, Don Henley's Inside Job, Billy Joel's Cold Spring Harbor, Bruce Hornsby and the Range's Scenes from the Southside, and Marc Cohn's The Rainy Season.  5 of your favorites?  $0 using your favorite file-sharing program, probably about $75 elsewhere.  $616 to go.  5. TiVo.  I have friends who have TiVo and love it.  Why waste valuable study time with commercials?  Why waste valuable study time programming a VCR?  Why waste valuable TV-watching time sleeping?   urlLink $249 .  And that monthly fee I guess, but we'll ignore that for now.  $367 left.  OK, I'm out of stuff.  Maybe I'm just cheap.  Cheap enough that I can't even spend hypothetical money.  I'll take the easy way out.  1 movie a week, you're probably at school 30 weeks, so $300 ($10 tickets in Boston and NY at least...).  And use the remaining $67 to buy a cheap inkjet printer so you don't have to trudge to the library every time you want to print.

      I have seen the devil and he is a lawyer.  This story is the perfect illustration of what you don't want law school to allow you to become, of the dark side that's out there, waiting to steal your soul.  You see, I'm on an alumni e-mail list called "Princeton-lawyers" -- for lawyers, law students, people interested in legal stuff.  Usually very little action.  Questions about how to find a [personal injury / contracts / international tax] lawyer in [Detroit / Des Moines / Denmark].  Occasionally a question about employee non-compete clauses and whether they're enforceable.  But yesterday, someone posted a question like this:  "I will be starting law school in the fall.  I have been asked to sing in a choir at a close friend's wedding in September. Going will require me to miss classes on Friday, potentially up to four courses.  Are 1L classes so important that I should give up going to the wedding so as not to miss them?"    {Note: the quotation marks are merely illustrative; I've paraphrased for issues of space, clarity, and anonymity protection}  I hope you're laughing.  Or at least shaking your head and thinking, "Incoming law students.  How naive and well-meaning."  I understand the impulse to post the question, I really do.  He doesn't know what law school's like, he's anxious, he's worried, he's concerned about doing something stupid his first month there.  I never respond to stuff on these lists, but I felt like I had something to contribute, so I shot him an e-mail that basically said that missing a couple of classes is really no big deal, especially for a good reason like you've got.  People will share their notes, make sure to catch up on the reading, people miss class all the time for no reason at all, so you really shouldn't worry too much about one day.  I thought my response was pretty typical of what any sane and rational person would say.  And apparently it was.  He posted later that day saying that he'd received 29 e-mail replies, and the verdict was unanimous in favor of him going to the wedding (yes, 29 replies.  I have no bad words to say about Princeton alumni.  Except for the bad words to follow in the next paragraph.)  And then someone replied to the whole list.  "Weddings are only once, but so is the start of law school.... I'd say: Don't even think about singing, in this context; go to class. You're really not in that tough a spot, in fact. What you have is an unfortunate conflict, but the decision, though causing a regrettable absence, is easy....  Not to minimize your concern, but if you take a long-term view of things (imagine looking back at this one in 20 years -- or 2 months), I think you might agree with what I've said."  {Those quotation marks are legitimate.  I can't improve on that response much.}  My first reaction was that he must be joking.  Especially regarding the long-term view.  Twenty years down the road: "boy am I glad I missed my friend's wedding for that Friday morning contracts class.  Learning about the parol evidence rule was something I couldn't have gotten from a book; but seeing the wedding photos was just as good as being there.  More classes, fewer friends, that's what I always say.  And I totally understood when my friend missed my wedding because his printer at work ran out of toner and he had to go buy more."  That was followed by another reply:  "I am with [that other guy] on this one. I am into friends and friendship... [b]ut this is the beginning of law school, of which there is only one, and I think you will be in quite a hole missing all those classes so you can do something that is really, really nice but not really urgent."  Are there words?  And both of these people are well out of school, at a point in their lives when they should have perspective on what's important.  And admittedly I'm picking on the two outliers; everyone else said he should go to the wedding.  Two posts especially helped restore my faith in the goodness of my fellow man, after reading those two that made me want to rip my eyes out.  The first, short and sweet: "It is easier to put things in perspective after you've been through them.  Ten years out of law school, I have a better sense of what made a difference.  Missing a few classes for a friend's wedding isn't one of them."  The second played a trump card and seems to have ended the debate: "As an Adjunct Professor of Law, if you showed up in my class and I heard your dilemma, I would immediately grab you by the shirt collar, lead you out of the building and throw you into a cab headed for the airport."  Thank you.    Please don't become those other two people.  Please.  They scare me.  They make me sad.  They make me worried for the state of the world.  They make me lose my faith that all people, deep down, are good, and know what really matters.  People matter.  Friends matter.  Relationships matter.  The heart matters.  A law school class, quite frankly, just cannot compete.  I have seen the devil, and he is a lawyer.

       urlLink JD2B  talks about law school grades being some combination of legal ability, burnout, and luck, with the perceived arbitrariness of them enhanced by the fact that there are so few grades to give out at the top that minutely fine distinctions must be made, and the rest of the stack just gets shunted off into the B-range.  I suppose I agree (although I'd probably collapse "burnout" into a broader category called "studying skills" and call my components of grading (1) legal skills, (2) writing skills, (3) study skills, (4) luck and/or fate).  The way I think of it is not so much that the grades are arbitrary but that they are valid but with a margin of error larger than the distinctions between grades.  So the B+ may in fact (as if there's an objective "fact" as to the quality of an answer) be an A- or a B without proving the invalidity of the whole process.  The other thing is that grades may not be measuring what they intend to measure.  Being asked a handful (or, on one of my spring exams, just one) question that touches on themes/topics/issues/facts brought up in the class may not cover the breadth of material adequately enough that luck isn't a factor as far as which pieces you understand better and which show up on the exam.  Writing ability to the extent that you can cover up a lack of understanding and depth can also be helpful for some questions -- although I'm content with the justification that writing ability can save you in a real legal setting too, even if you don't really know what you're talking about -- especially if the professor is grading the exams quickly, or the questions are easy enough that everyone's nailing the concepts and the only clear way to separate and rank is through clarity and quality of the writing (a note on this point: to the extent that someone's "writing skills" being greater than their "legal analysis skills" could play out on exams, I would think it would play out more in policy-related classes with relatively easy-to-comprehend law, like contracts, as opposed to more complex and hard-to-grasp subjects like civil procedure.  Not enough data to support or reject this hypothesis, so it's just a thought for now).  And perhaps some sort of exam-taking skills.

      Courtesy of  urlLink Baseball Primer , a site that all baseball fans ought to know about, here's an article from the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel about a  urlLink Pirates player hitting a racing sausage with a baseball bat .  Let me explain, I guess.  In Milwaukee, to entertain the legions of fans that flock to each night's game, people dressed as sausages race around the field in between innings.  Pirates first baseman Randall Simon, perhaps not realizing that these were people dressed as sausages, and not actual racing sausages themselves, hit one of the sausages with a baseball bat.  Oops.  He was led away from the park in handcuffs.  (Hence, this is law related.)  If I was Simon's lawyer, after thanking the spirits for giving me a wealthy client who has done a stupid thing that will eat up lots of hours of billable time, I'd perhaps think about basing a defense on Simon being Kosher, and not approving of sausage in any form, on a plate, or running around a field.

      I went to the Mets game with some friends last night, one of whom said he'd read my weblog more if I mentioned him in it.  Hi Eric.  Anyway, the guy who sang the national anthem was James Earl Jones.  But he didn't actually sing it.  It was more like he dramatically spoke it.  "Oh, say.  Can you see.  By the dawn's.  Early light."  The first hint that trouble was coming was when he said "...whose broad stars and bright stripes."  But not too many people picked up on that.  He got to "O'er the ramparts.  We watched."  And then he stopped.  And on the big screen you could see him look down.  At a very visible sheet of paper.  But he couldn't find his place.  So he paused.  And searched.  And searched.  And searched.  And then, after what was probably a solid four or five seconds, he continued.  "Were so gallantly streaming."  One fan began to boo.  Perhaps that was uncalled for.  But I couldn't help but laugh.  I don't know if there's a broader point here, perhaps about how Americans ought to know the national anthem (eh, not really -- I don't think I really believe that's necessary), but more importantly, how people who are going to stand in front of a crowd of 29,000 (that's the paid attendance; actual attendance probably more like 500.  These are, after all, the Mets) and recite the national anthem really ought to make sure they've got it memorized.  And over at CNN studios, I can just picture Take 1 on the promo recording.  "This is C-N...Z?"  "Sorry, James.  Why don't we try that again."  Is this related to law school?  Not unless the Mets sue him for non-performance.  But if they weren't paying him, and if no one left the stadium because of it (it's the Mets' play that makes the fans leave, not the national anthem), I don't know what kinds of damages they could claim... aw, too much law here.  This is what happens when you go to law school (or at least when you try and write about it).  You see the legal issues in everything, even when you don't need to.  Can't we just enjoy seeing celebrities make mistakes without worrying about the legal implications?  Kobe Bryant's lawyer agrees with me on that point, I bet.

      The last weekly newsletter we got before school ended told us that spring semester grades were due from the professors by June 13, and would be mailed out to us sometime between July 9th and July 18th.  As of this afternoon, I can say with confidence that they were not overestimating the time it would take in between when the professors turn in the grades and when they'd be mailed.  Because I have no grades yet.  And so I find myself a bit torn over what I know less about: what my grades will be (no clue), or why it could possibly take something on the order of a month for the registrar's office to do whatever it needs to do such that we can receive them (no clue).  Even assuming the professors don't have to send the grades in any kind of computerized or format, or bubble them into a bubble sheet that can then be processed in some electronic way, I still have no idea what could take so long.  3Ls get their grades before graduation (the "expedited" plan... which makes me wonder why if they can get them then can't the rest of us?), so there are about 1100 students left to have grades processed.  Probably an average of 4 classes per student.  4400 grades.  Even if there's only one person dealing with these grades, that's about 220 numbers to enter a day, if this man or woman works 5 days a week; about one every 2 minutes if he or she works 7 hours a day.  That's an extraordinarily long amount of time.  I've written this whole paragraph in about 2 minutes.  Surely someone could type the letter "B" more than 30 times an hour.  And that's the estimate if they're inputting things by hand.  If there's a computerized system, I simply have no idea what takes so long.  The sheets they mail us have nothing extraordinary on them -- not even a calculated GPA... just a list of classes and the grades.  I have no idea why this can't be done on the web somehow, so we could get them marginally quicker, but that's another issue entirely.  They have our mailing addresses, the envelopes aren't hand-delivered, nothing could possibly happen in between the professors handing in the grades and the school sending them out... I simply have no clue.  Perhaps they need to verify that each class conformed to some curve.  But how long could that really take?  Perhaps they input them and then send out confirmation sheets to the professors to verify with their own records.  Probably not.  But even if so, could that really add more than an extra day or two.  It's just a list of names (I mean ID numbers) and a couple of letters.  Which are pretty much all Bs anyway.  I have no idea what my grades are, am more curious to see what I got than I am really concerned about the result. But I think I'm most curious why it takes so darn long.

      Follow-up thought to my last post (below) -- some things it might be WORTH worrying about if you're an incoming 1L, as opposed to worrying about what a tort is, and when the UCC applies to contract situations:  1. Do I have a place to live? 2. Do I have clothing to match the climate of my school? 3. Am I taking too much crap with me that I'm not going to use or need, and that I'll just have to lug back home with me at the end of the year? 4. If in a dorm -- do I have flip-flops for the communal bathroom that will prevent me from getting a fungal disease on my feet? 5. Does my computer boot up with error-free consistency or is it going to crash during an exam? 6. Do I have enough money to buy textbooks? 7. Do I have enough strength to carry textbooks? 8. Does my breath smell bad enough that no one will want to be my friend? 9. Have I gotten the most of my current health insurance before switching over to the meager university plan -- make your dental / vision / urology appointments now before it's too late! 10. Have I gotten any lingering addictions under control so they're not a problem at school? 11. Is my future roommate learning how to play the oboe this summer? 12. Do I own a toilet plunger? 13. Have I figured out some easy and quick breakfasts to grab on those mornings when I'm running late but can't imagine sitting in class for 90 minutes on an empty stomach? 14. Do I have a good starter set of highlighters? 15. Do I have access to a printer that will be available whenever I need to print stuff? 16. Does the cable TV package at school include the Food Network? 17. Where did I put the remote control for the stereo I'm taking to school? 18. If I have a car, do I know where I'm parking it? 19. If I don't have a car, do I know someone who does? 20. Am I sure I sent in that deposit check???

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  posts a comment on  urlLink JD2B 's link to law.com's review of pre-law school preparation courses, like Law Preview and Bar/Bri's equivalent.  WT says: "These companies are preying on people who don't know better. Please, for the sake of your pocketbook, don't take these courses. I don't care who teaches them, or how good they might seem, or how confident "graduates" look the week after getting out. They're a waste of time, money, and effort, and all you get in return is a reputation as a gunner if word ever gets out about you."  And I totally agree.  Basically.  I think in general they're probably pretty useless.  Even if you're nervous about law school and feel like you'd be more comfortable knowing some background about each of your first-year classes -- even though it's really, really, really not necessary, and you really, really, really shouldn't be worried about this -- instead of paying $1000, or whatever it is these things cost, go onto lexis.com and download the free course outlines, and take a quick glance.  You'll probably find them pretty boring, but if you're really, really worried about this, they do give a nice summary of the courses.  You won't find it particularly useful, I don't think -- maybe on day one, if the professor starts talking about the overall scheme of the course, you'll know some vocabulary your classmates don't, but if it'll put your mind at ease, maybe worth a day or two of your time.  But they're free.  Free.  As opposed to these courses.  3 problems I can think of with the courses that are more subtle that the overall fact that they're useless wastes of money and time:  1. Each professor teaches his or her course differently.  So you may in fact spend a week learning stuff that your professor won't require you to learn -- or stuff that they intentionally don't want you to know right at the beginning, because they have their own way of presenting material so it makes the most sense in their scheme.  For example, in contracts class we learned remedies first, and spent a good 3 or 4 weeks talking about what you do when contracts are broken before looking at all about what a contract is.  And the professor had a reason, and wanted to teach it that way so we could see contracts from a certain angle and with a certain understanding... so if I had taken one of these courses beforehand, I would have gotten less out of my contracts class.  Would have not just been a waste of money, but a real academic negative, potentially impacting my grade in a bad way.  2. Like Wadding Thunder says, socially it can't possibly help.  Even if you don't tell anyone, any knowledge you have that comes out in class will brand you a gunner, or a suck-up, or some other negative thing.  I know of one person whose comments in class seemed to indicate that she may have read some stuff before starting school, and always seemed "too informed" about the topics in class.  This became the subject of a few lunchtime conversations and probably didn't help her make friends right away.  Personally, I think holding stuff like that against somebody is stupid.  But other people may feel differently.  Why risk it?  3. With the $1000 you might spend on these courses, you can probably pay a 3L to take your exams for you.  Problem solved.  Of course, I'm kidding about #3.  Mostly because I decided I had 3 points to make before I figured out what I was going to say, and so I had a #3 I needed to fill.  But #1 and #2 are real and honest.  These courses don't provide anything you need.  INTERESTING THOUGHT: If, by some stroke of magic, your 1L professor is teaching the course -- and you somehow know this before you need to sign up -- I wonder whether it would be a help (get to know the prof, no risk you'll be taught something other than what you need) or a hurt (prof sees you as a desperate, worried law student being sucked into these stupid courses).  Certainly I can't imagine it's a $1000 help in any event.  But what an interesting situation that would be.  Something to ponder while you incoming 1Ls wade through the piles of material about health insurance, dorm life, and financial aid I'm sure you're being bombarded with.

      Sorry about the two days with no posts.  Was away at a wedding with -- gasp -- no Internet access.  Also sorry that East Coast radio stations appear to be obsessed with the Kelly Clarkson song, "Miss Independent."  But at least that gives me a song to parody.  Sort of.  The title here is better than my parody.  "Missin' Defendant" (To the tune of "Miss Independent")  (Verse 1) Missin' defendant Frustrated lawyer Summary judgment, mmm  Plaintiffs allege A crime on the street And missin' defendant arrested  Evidence shows Maybe unclear But lawyer can't do much if the client don't show  So, there he sits down at the table Defendant don't answer her cell phone Little miss plaintiff's lawyer Says ooh, declare this done  (Chorus) What is the judge going to do? Where is defendant, where can she be Why all your clients never show up This ain't the first missin' defendant; maybe your lawyering's not effective Going to jail, and lawyer you fail  (Verse 2) Out on the street Violates bail Missin' defendant won't show up but police are out on her tail  But she miscalculated She didn't wanna end up incarcerated But this missin' defendant will end up in jail  But by showing you she didn't want you She went in a new legal direction And you've been fired, you've lost one more client You've been disbarred  (Chorus) What is the judge going to do? Where is defendant, where can she be Why all your clients never show up This ain't the first missin' defendant; maybe your lawyering's not effective Going to jail, and lawyer you fail   Also: an interesting article in this weekend's NY Times magazine about  urlLink Baby Names .  Not relevant to anything at all, but just kind of interesting, if you're bored.

      Haiku poems about dorm rooms  The heat just came on The first time it ever worked It is summertime  A smell in the hall Not food but sort of like food It's leftover food  Hear that awful noise? I wonder what it could be The guy next door snores  Look in the toilet No, look closer, look closer Ha. I made you look.  Look in the shower A rat peeking from the drain But at least he's clean  Forgot my sandals Is this really a big deal? My foot's infected  Trying to study But someone is having fun Stop having fun please  4 in the morning But it's very hard to tell They're all still awake  My alarm clock rings? No, it is my neighbor's clock But I can hear it  There are no windows The brochure did not say that They think lying's fun

      Another link today from  urlLink JD2B .  I always feel pressure when I get linked, to post something extra-good so that any new visitors are extra-impressed and want to come back.  (I'm afraid it's thoughts like that which may have led me to become a law student, too...)  So, I posted a sketch last week sort of about the Supreme Court affirmative action decision (below).  Against my better judgment, here's one sort of about the other Supreme Court decision last week, about that thing that rhymes with lobotomy.  But not really.  "Tourism Committee"  (Lights up on WALLY BELL, state tourism commissioner)  WALLY I'm state tourism commissioner Wally Bell.  Over the past few years, I've been working to draw more and more visitors to some of our state's greatest attractions.  And I'm proud to say that my campaign has been a tremendous success.  In the past ten years, more people than ever before have swam in our polluted rivers, picnicked in our mosquito-infested parks, and bathed on our filthy beaches.  But one site has proven especially attractive.  Under my watch, we've increased visitation ten-fold, and made this place "the place to be" for visitors to our state, whether they're here for a week, or for a lifetime.  It's become the hottest ticket in town, hosting more Americans than ever before.  Of course, I'm talking about jail.  (A chain gang enters)  WALLY I know jail's not often thought of as a popular tourist attraction, and it's true, in the past it's been somewhat neglected, and the prisoners - I mean tourists - haven't experienced the first class treatment we'd all like to think our state is known for.  But under my watch, that's changed.  I've invited some visitors to talk about the renaissance that jail has undergone recently, and let you know about some of the improvements we've made.  It's all part of the kickoff to my campaign, entitled "That's Today's Jail."  But don't take my word for it.  Listen to what these fine folks have to say.  CHAIN GANG MEMBER #1 I remember coming here when I was a kid, with my parents.  This was their favorite vacation spot, and they never missed an opportunity to spend some time down here with their buddies in the neighboring cells.  They wanted me to have fond memories of the place, since even when I was young I showed a great interest in coming back here myself one day.  And ever since I was a teenager, I've chosen to spend more and more of my free time down here, in between jobs, or as a needed break after a strenuous business transaction. One thing I remember from my trips here as a kid was that the cells were pretty small, and had no windows.  But since the new tourism campaign, they've put one little window in each cell, tempered glass with reinforced steel bars.  At the right time of day, if I stand on the toilet and squint, I can see a ray of sunlight reflecting off the electrified fence.  A tiny little window.  That's today's jail.  CHAIN GANG MEMBER #2 When I first got to jail, I was surprised at the lack of scheduled activities.  Besides mealtime and hard labor, there really wasn't much in the way of recreation.  But ever since they brought in that deck of cards and installed the gumball dispenser, it's been like a whole new place.  Plus sometimes there's even chocolate chips in the cookies.  More variety.  That's today's jail.  CHAIN GANG MEMBER #3 Although it may not always be apparent, most of us here in jail want to be law-abiding citizens, and it frustrates us when the things we enjoy doing happen to be prohibited by law.  For me, it created a lot of mental anguish and distress when I discovered that one of my favorite activities here in jail was actually illegal.  Since this activity was one of the pastimes that drew me back here time and time again, it kept eating at my soul that every time I did this thing with one (or more) of the other prisoners, I was breaking the law.  But now that the Supreme Court has said that this thing is legal, I have nothing to worry about.  Me and my friends can enjoy this pleasurable prison activity without worrying that we're running afoul of federal statutes against that sort of thing.  Favorite prison pastimes now legal.  That's today's jail.  WALLY As you can see, jail is really the place to be here in this state.  And with our crackdown on crime - I mean our new tourism drive - we're offering almost everyone a free stay, for a limited time. Whether you're speeding down the highway, smoking in any public establishment, jaywalking, or killing your wife with an axe, you'll get a chance to see for yourself how much we've changed, and what it's like to spend some time at this state's most popular tourist destination.  A tiny little window, gumballs for a quarter, and exciting other now-legal activities.  That's today's jail.  See you soon.  (blackout)

      Haven't added one of these installments in a while, and can't think of anything else to write about today, so how about...   The Children's Guide to Law School, Chapter 3: Legal Journals  At home, you or your parents probably receive magazines in the mail.  Some magazines are about sports, some are about the news, some are about famous people and the tiniest details of their lives that no one really needs to know about, some have pictures of pretty people, some have pictures of pretty, naked people, some have pictures of pretty food, some have pictures of pretty furniture, some have pictures of pretty window ornaments, some have odd, pretentious cartoons that only sophisticated people find amusing, some have long articles about how bad Republicans are, some have long articles about how bad Democrats are, and some just have long lists of everything that's on TV.  A legal journal is like a magazine about law, except there are no pictures, and instead of the articles being interesting, they're really not.  In fact, one rule of thumb is that the more interesting the articles are, the worse the journal is.  The very best journals, in fact, are barely written in English.  Each journal weighs about as much as a canteloupe and is roughly the same texture on the outside.  At law school, most students work on at least one journal.  Some say the reason they do this is because they enjoy the work.  Those people are liars.  Some say the reason they do it is because it looks good on their resume, and the work's not really that bad.  Those people are just rationalizing.  A rare handful of people say the reason they do it is because everyone else is doing it, and so if they don't know it, they're worried that somehow this will reflect poorly on them, even though it's not completely clear how and why.  Those people are going to be terrible lawyers, but live honest and genuine lives.  Working for a law journal because you like to write is like working for a mining company because you like gold jewelry.  Yes, there is writing in these journals.  No, your work has nothing to do with anything that can even remotely be called 'writing' or compared to, say, the articles in any magazine ever published for a mass market audience to make a profit.  People who do work for legal journals typically are tasked with checking footnotes.  There are two different dimensions on which footnotes need to be checked.  One is worse than the other, but I'm not sure which.  I think it depends on the person and how little of a personality he or she has.  The first dimension is technical comptence -- is the footnote actually technically correct?  Are the commas in the right place?  Is the font right?  Is the name of the source spelled correctly?  Should there be one space or two spaces after the period?  Should there be a period there at all?  Should there be two?  Should they be printed or hand-written in on every copy?  Is that a comma or a cookie crumb?  What does it taste like?  The second dimension is substantive correctness -- Is the right source being footnoted?  Is the quote copied exactly?  Is the page number correct?  Does the book stand for the proposition that the text says it does?  Does the book exist at all?  Did the author make it up just because he needed a footnote there?  Does it sound real?  If we leave it, do you think anyone will notice?  Could "Lawyer McLawyerson" really be an author's name?  And could he have really written the book, "Lawyer McLawyerson's Guide to Lawyerly Law and the Lawgal system as practiced in Lawyerland, Lawburgh, Lapland, and Lawville?"  And is there really a page number 23.6?  As you might imagine, checking whether a book really stands for the proposition the text asserts it does may in some cases require you to actually find the book and even open it up and read a few pages.  Luckily, many law books have titles that make their point of view self-evident.  For example, "Ships Are Subject To International Law," by Admiral Jones.  If that book were to be cited, it would not be that hard to tell if the footnote was okay.  But some books, like "Important Law Stuff," may have a less clear point of view.  These require reading.  But first they require finding.  Luckily, every library in the world has every book ever written, and owns an unlimited number of copies so the book you need is never missing from the shelf.  Like Blockbuster, which always has copies of all of the new videos, even if you show up Sunday night after a long weekend when it's been raining and the only new movies in the theater are 'From Justin to Kelly," and the new one with Kirstie Alley and Tim Allen, "Low-Budget Romantic Comedy With A Bad Script."  Also starring three people who used to be on Saturday Night Live, and four people who wish they were.  And Ron Reagan, Jr.  And Pat Sajak.  And Ivana Trump.  Where was I?  Oh yeah, legal journals.  They're not terrible, but they're really that much fun.  Although, for the amount of the time they take up, it's probably worth it and it can be a decent experience and it looks nice on a resume and your name is on a masthead of something, and sometimes they give out free food at meetings.  Cool.

      I had a dream (a nightmare?) last night that I got my spring semester grades (yeah, still haven't gotten them).  In my dream, I got an F, an F, and an F+.  Really.  But in my dream, I also got the grades for next semester's classes that I haven't taken yet.  And in those I got an A, an A-, a B++, and a W.  I don't know what the W stood for.  Perhaps "What a weird dream," or "Wow, you need to stop thinking about law school," or "Why would you be taking new classes next semester if you get 2 Fs (and an F+!!) this semester?"  Hopefully not an indication of things to come, whenever it is we actually do get grades.

      I played ultimate frisbee this afternoon and ultimately got sunburned.  Forgot sunscreen.  Oops.  Hopefully a good night's sleep will do the trick.  It's really not that bad, just a little pink around the eyes mostly.  Google tells me lotion with aloe should help the healing.  After playing, I put some names and facts together and realized that I think one of the people I was playing with writes a weblog I read.  I'm sure I'll figure that out for sure sometime soon (especially if he reads mine too, which I think he might).  Here's a song parody.  "Firm, Firm, Firm" (to the tune of "Turn, Turn, Turn" by The Byrds)  In the fall - firm, firm, firm This is the season - firm, firm, firm There's a firm for every student who is breathing  A firm for the boy, on law review A firm for the girl, who likes to sniff glue A firm for the wand'rer who hasn't a clue A firm for the one, with a grade-point of 2  In the fall - firm, firm, firm This is the season - firm, firm, firm There's a firm for every student who knows Lexis  A firm with good food, a firm on the beach This firm's a safety but this one's a reach One firm that soon will say it's bankrupt But one firm who'll hire all their lawyers   In the fall - firm, firm, firm This is the season - firm, firm, firm There's a firm for every student with no jail time  One profits from war, one profits from peace One from cigarettes, and one from disease One firm pays less than the others That firm does not get any students  In the fall - firm, firm, firm This is the season - firm, firm, firm There's a firm for every student who's done sleeping  A firm for you, a firm for me A firm that wil fly you to meet them for free A firm who will woo you, a firm who will plead A firm that will promise you you will succeed A firm that will work you until your eyes bleed

      I saw the movie "Thirteen" this evening, which, in case you haven't heard of it, is about a nice girl who turns bad under the influence of "the popular girl" at school, and starts using drugs, piercing herself, and dressing like a hooker.  I closed my eyes during the piercings.  I don't handle blood well.    In all, I thought the movie was profoundly disturbing, but not, unfortunately, disturbingly profound.  I would have preferred to see "The Battle of Shaker Heights," because I like my movies light and fluffy, but I was outvoted.    The acting in "Thirteen" is quite good.  The characters were really convincing.  Which I suppose made it all the more disturbing, and I can't really say it's a *bad* movie.  It's just unpleasant to watch.  So, if you've had a good day, and want to watch something unpleasant to ruin all that before you go to sleep, I recommend "Thirteen."  Also if you are a parent of a teenage girl and want all sorts of stuff to become paranoid about, I highly recommend -- I imagine this movie will do the trick.  If you are usually depressed, but find yourself happy for some reason, this movie should help restore a state of normalcy in you.  If you'd always wanted to watch someone's tongue get pierced on screen, but haven't found the right movie yet, this one is for you.  If you prefer your movies to be the opposite of "heartwarming," check this one out.  If you are a fan of seeing teenage girls dressed like hookers, again, this may be your kind of movie.  If you left "Seabiscuit" wishing Tobey Maguire was really a thirteen-year-old girl, and instead of riding horses his passion was smoking crack, then, once more, this is the movie for you.  If you'd rather gouge out your eyes with a fork than frolic in the woods, this is most certainly your kind of film.  If you prefer to cry yourself to sleep, please see this movie.  It disturbs me to no end that I have seen 3 of the 6 movies playing in the "independent" movie theater.  Because I like formulaic Hollywood crap, I really do.  And definitely don't want to have to think of myself as the kind of person who sees independent movies on a regular basis.  That would really mess with my head.  But the saving grace is that I only liked one of them.  Of course, that was Spellbound.  Go see Spellbound if you haven't.  I promise, promise, promise that you will like it.  Spellbound.  Even though talking about it makes me sound like a complete dork.  Even among law students.  I don't care.  Go see Spellbound.  Or, if you'd rather start drinking again, go see "Thirteen."

      I bought a small refrigerator for my dorm last year, and stored it at school over the summer.  This year I'm in an apartment that comes with a real fridge, so I don't need my dorm one.  So I put up a sign saying it's for sale.  And tried really hard to be funny, but the best I could come up two days ago when I posted the sign was "I'll even help you push it down the hall."  Which isn't really that funny.  I then posted a message on a message board about it.  And tried harder to be funny.  And the best I could come up with was "refrigerator was one year old yesterday (happy birthday)," which manages to simultaneously be unfunny and make me sound like a moron.  Now, if I were to have to re-post another sign (which I don't, because someone bought the fridge, despite the sign's lack of funny), it might read something like this:  Single, White Dorm Refrigerator Seeking New Home  Housebroken; hardly ever leaks on the rug Not lactose intolerant; stores dairy just fine Drug/disease free Mostly enjoys just sitting at home Likes: baking soda, electricity, and ice trays Dislikes: arrogance, poor hygiene, and pickles Unable to have children  (Which, of course, would still not be funny, but would at least demonstrate some effort)

      Questions not to ask specific law firms during interviews:  Allen & Overy -- "Is that 'Overy' like the reproductive organ?" Fish & Richardson -- "Is that 'Fish' like the sea creature?" Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen, & Katz -- "Are there any Jewish people at your firm?" O'Melveny & Myers -- "Are there any Irish people at your firm?" Cadwalader -- "Does anyone ever get the pronunciation of your firm's name confused with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' famous tag line, 'Cowabunga?'" Akin Gump -- "Is Forrest Gump one of the guys your firm is named after?" Ropes Gray -- "Are all of the Ropes in your office Gray?" Hale & Dorr -- "Is that 'Dorr' like the hole in the wall that people use to enter and exit a room or a building?" Milbank Tweed -- "Does the word 'bank' in part of your name imply that you are richer than the other firms?" Kilpatrick & Lockhart -- "Has anyone ever pointed out that your firm name is kind of close to a complete sentence.  If it was 'Kill Patrick and Lock Hart Up,' it would in fact be a whole sentence that makes pretty good sense." White & Case -- "Is Royals left fielder Rondell White one of the guys your firm is named after?" Black & Decker -- "Don't you in fact make household appliances?" Binney & Smith -- "I like your crayons." A & E -- "I think you're actually a cable channel."

      Orientation 101: Two Truths And A Lie, The Inside Scoop!  Two Truths And A Lie is a popular orientation game where each person says three things about him or herself, two true, and one made up.  The key to the game is coming up with strange enough truths that people guess the lie incorrectly.  Most people commonly make the mistake of coming up with lies that are so outside the realm of possibility, that the game is no fun at all.  For example:  1. I'm allergic to shellfish 2. My middle name is Jennifer 3. I have no pancreas  See, that's no fun at all.  Another problem with the game is when people just use it as an excuse to trumpet their accomplishments.  To wit:  1. My team finished first at the Moot Court championships in Cyprus 2. I got a 1600 on the SAT 3. I once got a question wrong on a spelling test in 3rd grade  "Number 3 is a lie.  I never got any questions wrong on the spelling tests in 3rd grade.  Ha!"  This is clearly obnoxious.  A third problem is when people say things that are so specific no one could possibly know, nor possibly care.  To illustrate:  1. I had a fish named Scooter when I was six years old 2. I had a dog named Spot when I was nine years old 3. I had a cat named Betsy when I was twelve years old  Who cares?!?  A final problem is when people reveal awkward facts about themselves that are way too personal for people they've just met.  Like:  1. I have gonorrhea 2. I have syphillis 3. I have genital warts  On the other hand, answers like these make it very clear if anyone slept with the person the previous evening.  "Two of those are true?  Aw, damn.  I'm in deep trouble now."  A winning set of statements should be insightful, yet amusing; challenging, yet accessible; personal, yet universal.  Or, alternatively, you can try sarcasm:  1. I hate this game 2. I strongly dislike this game 3. I love this game more than life itself!

      Yesterday, I had lunch with a bunch of friends from my section last year.  Some of the conversation was about On Campus Interviewing (OCI).  Things I haven't done yet which apparently other people have, with regard to on campus interviewing:  1. Research the financial stability of firms.  Apparently there exist law firms at the brink of extinction.  Apparently it's a bad idea to take a job with them because the job, I guess, depends in a large part on the firm continuing to exist.  Apparently people have ways of finding out this stuff.  2. Really, really, really think about what makes one firm different from another, and why I'm interviewing in one place and not another.  I've already done a little bit of this, with some help from the NALP guide (http://www.nalpdirectory.com), and some help from the Vault guides (which, when I mentioned them at lunch, got less than rave reviews -- apparently those quality of life rankings have some correlation with the "how much did the firm pay Vault" rankings), and some help from the firm web pages.  Apparently there are other sources out there I still need to find.  3. "Beat the system" by figuring out the algorithm used to assign interviewees to firms and use to your advantage.  OK, no one actually brought this up at lunch, but I couldn't really have a list of two items and feel like I'd accomplished anything.

      I kind of wish there was 2L orientation.  It's a little boring without any library tours to take.  Also would give me more stuff to write about.  Occasionally, as I pass a group of Harvard 1Ls walking around on campus, I get a tad misty-eyed.  Part of me also wonders how many Harvard 1Ls have stumbled across this and read it, but I expect the answer's probably pretty low.  I'd guess about a dozen.  I dunno.  If any of them are reading this and have any funny orientation stories, I'm all ears.  10 things the law school's groundskeeping and construction crews have done over the summer (and maybe your school did this stuff too!):  1. They transformed a couple of crappy classrooms into gorgeous new ones, just in time for me not to have any classes there anymore. 2. They magically made the patches of dead brown grass return to life. 3. They erected a big ugly tent in the middle of the courtyard. 4. They put up lots of signs telling you which building you're standing in front of. 5. The new "plaza" in front of the student center that definitely wasn't there before, and actually looks pretty nice. 6. They killed the law school hobos and swept them away. 7. Police tape, in lots of unusual locations. 8. Extra golf carts and construction vehicles motoring down student walkways without any sort of horn or other warning sounds. 9. New font on the sign outside the cafeteria telling us what the meal is. 10. No more final exams.  I'm kidding about that last one.

      "My second thirty minutes back on campus: an even more excruciatingly detailed description"  I'm kidding.  I won't put you through that.  Leafing through our first Adviser of the year.  The Adviser is a weekly newsletter we get with administrative announcements, student organization meeting news, research assistant job postings from professors, etc.  Basically all of the really useful things we need to know.   And the not so useful.  1.  "For the first month of publication, the names of student organizations and HLS buildings are spelled out.  Initials will be used beginning with the first issue in October."  Uh, HLS, I'm looking at you here.  1A.  "The Adviser is available online... viewable with Adobe Acrobat Reader (available free from the ITS software site...)" Uh, ITS, I'm looking at you here.  1B.  "Please watch for... the HIV pamphlet."  Uh, HIV, I'm looking at you here.  2.  "Attention, All Student Organization Leaders.  Please check the mailroom for any mail or packages you may have there.... Some of this mail may contain valuable information for you and your organization."  Oh, is that what mail might contain?  Thanks.  3. Regarding one class: "For our first meeting... there is no assigned reading."  4. Another class: "Class will meet... in a room TBA."  5. "Study materials or personal belongings should not be left unattended [in the library]... Library materials will be reshelved."  I don't know why that seems funny to me.  I guess it's not.  I'm just wondering what else they would possibly think of doing with unattended library materials besides reshelving them, and if reshelving them is really such a harsh penalty for leaving them unattended.  I thought this would be funnier that it is.  Oops.

      "My first thirty minutes back on campus: a very, very, very detailed description"   [Ed. note: Exact times are merely approximations.  There is no way the author did all of this in thirty minutes.  But he wrote the title of this piece before he wrote the column, so hes kind of forced himself into a structure and will feel like hes failed if he doesnt get something out of this.  So just play along.]   Wednesday, 2:12 PM.  Back on campus.  The campus looks pretty much the same.  New bricks in front of the student center.  I heard someone call it a plaza.  Just looked like new bricks to me.  My first stop when I got back was Three Aces, the local pizza place, to see if theyd finished making the turkey sub I ordered back in May.  There was another guy there waiting for the pizza he ordered last winter.  Why does it take them so long to slice open a piece of bread and put some lettuce inside?  This isnt really a twenty-minute task.  Good thing they dont have eight-hour take-home exams here.  Theyd never finish.  Wednesday, 2:19 PM.  To the bookstore, to buy my books.  I've already written my shtick on buying books yesterday, so you can check that out below.  Wednesday, 2:32 PM. To the course packet distribution center, to say hello to hunched-over man and elderly woman, the two people Ive noticed who work there all the time.  I asked if there was a list of courses with packets.  They said there was no list, but I should just tell him all of my courses.  Three of the four had packets.  Amazingly, two of the three packets I were given are the correct ones.  I didnt notice one was wrong until I got outside.  I now have a super-secret copy of the syllabus for Seminar on Wills and Trusts.  Shhh.  Dont tell anyone.  Wednesday, 2:32:30 PM.  To the Office of Career Services, to pick up the resume I had them take a look at.  They cut all of my pronouns, and the words the and a.  This bothers.  Me.  Because now all sentences look not as English is first language of me.  If me legal employer read resume, me no want see sentence bad.  Me want sentence friendly good.  Honestly, Im a bit perplexed by this.  In response, I plan on adding extra pronouns and resubmitting.  I am serving as a subciter, and on some articles, I am serving as the only subciter, for the Harvard Journal on blah blah blah, which is the biggest, or I think it is perhaps the third biggest, journal on the Harvard the campus, at least that I know of. I the the the I.  The reader also told me to justify dates and locations.  I thought just mentioning them was enough.  I didnt realize I needed to justify them.  Wednesday, 2:32:45:30:62:45:03:24 PM.  To a small room in the basement to pick up a form for a locker.  They should put pens by the forms to save me a second trip.  But they didnt.  The room to pick up these forms is in the tunnels under the law school right by a bathroom with a security code (don't steal the toilet paper!).  Wouldnt it be funny if my locker code ends up being the same as the bathroom code?  These are the thoughts that keep me up at night.  Wednesday, 2:37 PM. To the library, to check my e-mail.  I got an e-mail saying my resume was ready for pickup at career services.  Thanks.  Wednesday, 2:41 PM.  To my student mailbox.  All summer, and only three pieces of mail.  Im invited to a Public Interest reception!  Wow!  I feel so special!  (I would feel more special if I didnt see the same invitation in everyone elses mailbox.)  Wednesday, 2:41:30 PM.  Back to Three Aces, to see if that turkey sub would finally be ready.  Wednesday, 2:41:45 PM.  Oh, hi!  How was your summer?  Good, good.  Yeah, mine too.  Yeah, too fast.  Yeah, excited to be back.  Yeah, noticed the new plaza outside the student center.  Yeah, could have bought some crack with the money I spent on textbooks.  Yeah, career services, resume, yeah.  Yeah, distribution center.  Oh, you got invited to the Public Interest reception too?  Cool.  Yeah, street people in Harvard Square.  No, my turkey sub isnt ready either.  Wednesday, 2:42 PM.  Boy, that was quite a busy half hour.

      Bought my books.  4 classes, 5 books, $297.  These are some big books.  Also picked up the syllabi and supplemental reading packets.  In one of my classes, we're each assigned to give a presentation.  The professor writes in the syllabus that the order will be determined by the last 3 digits of our student ID numbers.  So now I'm left to wonder until next week whether "032" (that's not really the last 3 numbers of my ID#, but it's close enough that it does the trick for these purposes -- I wouldn't be silly enough to post my ID number on the web) is crazy-low, or everyone has a "0" there and it's really pretty middle-of-the-pack.  Honestly, it would probably be good to get the presentation over with the second week of class (the first week of presentations), but deep down nothing really excites me about having to do it right away.  Oh well, I have no control over it so no use worrying about it.  That was not a particularly funny paragraph.  Let's try this -- other things I could have done with $297 besides buy my books:  1. 5940 pieces of Bazooka gum 2. Almost 10 cavity fillings (amalgam) under the Harvard supplemental dental insurance plan 3. Almost 5 cavity fillings (white) under the insurance plan 4. Pay the fine for keeping a library book about three and a half years overdue 5. Some amount of crack that I would have a better idea of if I was someone else who knows about that kind of stuff but I'm not 6. 24 online credit reports, with some change left over to mail back a bunch of credit card statements 7. 74 Blockbuster DVD rentals 8. Lots of ice cream 9. Pay bill for using cell phone a whole bunch of extra daytime minutes 10. Paying someone to do the calculations that I'm too lazy to do to figure out how much ice cream or how many minutes (or how much crack, I guess)

      A ridiculous post on the Princeton Review law school discussion board (not that most of them aren't ridiculous, but this one seems extra-ridiculous):  ----------------------------------------------- SUBJECT: What do law students eat?  "I started law school last week, but am still unsure as to what students eat. I'm trying to decide on lunch, but want to make sure I fit the mold of a true law student. Should I eat hot food? Deli sandwich? Salad, yogurt and fruit? I don't want to be seen as "that guy," so I want to fit into the whole environment here. If you know of anything, please advise." -----------------------------------------------  Um... he doesn't want to be seen as "that guy?"  "That guy" who eats hot food?  "That guy" who eats a turkey sandwich? How about "that guy" who thinks that anyone cares what he eats for lunch?  SUBJECT: How do law students put the toilet paper on the roll?  "I started law school last week, but am still unsure as to how students put the toilet paper on the roll.  I'm trying to decide whether it should come up over the top, or if it should just hang down below.  Or maybe law students are so special they don't need to wipe.  I don't want to be seen as "that guy" who doesn't know how to put toilet paper on the roll, and get ostracized from all of the law school activities open only to experts in toilet paper etiquette.  If you know of anything, please advise."

      One reader -- let's call him Gilbert Nutshell -- e-mailed me to ask about what I thought of supplemental study guides.  In case you don't know what these are, visit your local law school bookstore and you'll find them right below the sign that says "study guides are not returnable."  If you don't see that sign, you might want to buy some, read them, and then return them, but we'll get to that tip in just a minute.  Anyway, you'll notice they come in a bunch of flavors.  Because long lists of things are usually funny, here's a long list of just some of the kinds of study guides you might find:  Gilbert's Nutshells  E-Z Rules Professor Series  Legalines Legalpolygons  Roadmaps Mapquest  Blond's Brunette's  Examples & Explanations  Black Letter Series Extra line no one will notice Casenotes Outline Series  Sum & Substance Sub & Sumstance Emanuel's  Understanding Series  Another extra line no one will notice CrunchTime  Siegel's Series  Ha, ha, ha!  Long lists are so funny!  Anyway... here's an edited-for-comedic-value version of the e-mail question Gilbert Nutshell sent me:  "I have a professor who only speaks German.  Incidentally, he loves Goulash and you may have seen him eating last night at the restaurant you visited and reported on last night.  While he seems like a nice person, I fear I will not learn anything he is teaching, since I don't speak German.  I was also unable to tell from our first class today whether he is my Contracts professor, or actually the registrar giving us instructions on the course selection process.  If the latter, he may actually have been speaking English, but the instructions were too complicated for me to understand.  Especially since I had to leave in the middle of the class and get a Hepatitis vaccine to finish my immunization requirements.    My question: Should I go to the campus bookstore and buy a study guide?  Or should I buy a German-to-English dictionary?  Or should I wait and see if he learns English on his own and things get better?  I don't want to fall behind.  I've already missed a reading assignment since I don't know what pages he assigned, and the syllabus is written in Chinese.  I think his secretary speaks only Chinese.  The love child they have together speaks only Russian.  I barely speak English.  What should I do?"  My answer, in a Nutshell (ten points for laughing at that):  1. There is no way to know after one day of classes whether or not you need a study guide.  Wait a couple of weeks, and then see if the material is coming together.  Some professors, even German ones, start off the class in ways designed to be confusing (much like a German restaurant next door to a synagogue would be), and then they bring it all together like magic in order to make themselves seem all-powerful.  Plus, different professors emphasize different pieces of the subject, and approach things in different ways -- black letter vs. policy, for example -- so you won't know at least for a little while which study guides will be helpful, and which won't.   2. And even if you feel you need something, a study guide may not be what you need.  Perhaps you need an old outline from a 2L or 3L who might be willing to give you one -- most useful by far are those from classes taught by the same professor; next best but not really even close are different professor but same casebook; different professor and different casebook and you may be very prepared -- for a different exam than the one you'll be taking.  Perhaps you need to go to office hours and see if the professor can help you one-on-one, or perhaps if you can sleep with him or her for a higher grade and not have to take the exam or learn the material at all.  Or perhaps the professor only speaks German for effect in class and is really from Long Island and speaks perfect English -- well, perfect English with a horrid accent, that is.  3. And, if you know you want a study guide, check out if your law school library has a copy -- or if the local city library might -- or if you have 2L or 3L friends who kept theirs and can let you have / borrow them, or check out your bookstore's returns policy.  As interesting as these things are, they're kind of pricey, and no need to spend the money if you don't have to.

      Had dinner in a German restaurant with a friend.  Apparently, Monday nights are special at this restaurant.  Goulash, or Trout.  Nothing else.  $5 for the goulash, $6 for the trout.  Here's a haiku about it:  Six dollars for trout And five dollars for goulash But free to walk out  Naw, it wasn't that bad.  Dense, but not bad.

      Courtesy of JD2B,  urlLink Max Power  has a good, although not that surprising, post with thoughts on interviewing from the other side of the desk.  Max's tips, in shorthand:  1. Be likeable 2. Know your resume 3. Know the firm and why you want to work there 4. Have a plausible geographical story  Seems reasonable enough.

       urlLink Sua Sponte  has a great post with questions to ask during law firm interviews when you're stuck and can't think of anything to say.  Useful stuff to keep in the back of one's head for interviews.  At the bottom of her post, she wonders if maybe I could come up with a parody.  Well, I can at least try.  Ten things NOT to ask a lawyer on the recruiting path:  1. Have you tried Listerine? 2. Is it okay that I've completely forged my transcript? 3. The secretaries -- are they easy? 4. There aren't any German people at the firm, are they?  Because I hate German people. 5. How much did that suit cost?  Looks like a knock-off. 6. My sex change operation turned out okay, right?  Can hardly tell, eh? 7. Did you floss today?  Because I can see some stuff... nah, nevermind. 8. Any crack houses near the office? 9. How do you look at yourself in the mirror every morning? 10. I'm sorry, could you tell me the name of your firm again?  I've suddenly forgotten.

      A pointless multiple-choice game here.  Here's most of a sentence I just wrote in an e-mail to a friend:  "I still have no idea how people manage to work at a job for 20, 30, 40, 50 years -- if it's not their passion and they're just there to collect a paycheck -- long hours, lots of days a week -- [BLANK]"  Help me fill that [BLANK] in.  What I ended up writing was one of these eight things:  A) "although I suppose collecting that paycheck isn't a bad reason to be there." B) "but I guess that's all of our likely fates since how many people can really work at something they love?" C) "without throwing themselves in front of a train or something." D) "so perhaps I should ask an investment banker to explain it to me." E) "but I guess they manage okay and I'll figure it out eventually." F) "and still find the strength to wake up every morning." G) "but I admire them for being able to do it." H) "and I guess that's why I still have two more years of law school left."  Can you tell which one?  I think it's kind of cool I was able to think of 8 different ways to end that sentence!

      Long article in the always-excellent  urlLink New York Times Magazine  about the President of Harvard University, Larry Summers.  For those interested, here's what it says about the law school:   (Interested parties may note the second half of the excerpt here, which says the law school isn't likely moving across the river to Allston.  There are lots of people who seem to care deeply about this issue.  I'm not one of them, and don't see how either the law school moving or not moving would affect my life.  But nonetheless, this seems to be something some people are concerned about.)  "But Summers's most notorious power struggle came with the law school, and it wasn't over budget lines. Summers had identified Harvard Law as the one school most in need of presidential supervision, for despite its magisterial reputation it had been losing both students and scholars to other institutions. When Robert Clark, the school's longtime dean, agreed to step down, the faculty decided to appoint a committee to seek a successor. This was a transparent power play, for the appointment of a dean is arguably the most important power reserved to the president. The day the committee was to be established, Summers went to the law school and spoke to the entire faculty. According to one professor, Summers said flatly, ''The president is charged with sole responsibility to appoint a dean.''   The meeting degenerated into a series of angry exchanges. One veteran professor I spoke to denounced Summers as ''a control freak'' and mocked Summers's hierarchical ''Washington'' style. ''He doesn't give a damn what anybody thinks,'' said another professor. And Summers managed to make things worse by unintended acts of boorishness. He told a junior member of the law-school faculty that a question she had asked was dumb; surprised to hear later that the young woman was offended, he apologized grudgingly.   And yet Summers ultimately did what was widely perceived as the right thing. The search committee he appointed was respected within the law school. And Elena Kagan, a former Clinton administration official and recent arrival at the law school, whom he chose as dean (ultimately, the search committee was window dressing), was the one member of the faculty acceptable to virtually all parties. When I saw Summers recently, he said that not only the selection of Kagan but also the process of selecting her had led to a ''clearing of the air.''   This may be true. Martha Minow, a highly regarded member of the law-school faculty and one of the Summers skeptics, told me that the choice of Kagan showed that Summers had read the mood of the faculty very carefully. ''There's an extraordinary feeling of a new beginning at the law school right now,'' she said. Minow had also just come from listening to Summers address a conference on affirmative action, where he had delivered an endorsement of the process with which he had been grappling. That was a surprise. ''He is moved,'' Minow said, ''by powerful intellectual arguments.''   ...  Summers also seems to have reached a decision about the new campus at Allston that is consistent with his vision of Harvard. The question of Allston is the question of what Harvard should be like in 20, 30, even 50 years. What is it that needs to be bigger? What needs to be next to what? Does proximity even matter? Soon after arriving, Summers concluded that Allston should serve as the home either of the professional schools, and above all the law school, or of the sciences. The law school devoted tremendous time and resources to demonstrating that moving it would be a catastrophic mistake. The various science faculties were more open to a move, if extremely wary. Summers says he will announce his decision in the fall, but according to several sources, he has in fact already essentially chosen to move the sciences (as well as some other facilities) to Allston -- a decision that will make an important statement about the future of the university. Summers will then have to make a series of incredibly complicated decisions, which boil down to: Which sciences will go, and where?"

      Ten things 2Ls and 3Ls might say that 1Ls should be skeptical of:  1. "No, no, you're not allowed to use the bathrooms.  They're for 2Ls and 3Ls only."  2. "Professors like it when you interrupt them without raising your hand.  They also like it when you play with the microphones while they're talking, and when you don't do the reading."  3. "Here's a little secret they don't tell you about.  Each class has a surprise midterm exam.  At some point during the semester, you'll walk into class and the professor will spring a test on all of you.  But they never say anything about it, and you're not supposed to talk to your classmates about it.  Just keep up on your studying and be ready for it."  4. "You didn't know classroom attire was business formal?"  5. "No, no, looking for a summer job isn't really necessary.  Firms come to campus very late in the spring looking for 1Ls.  It's impossible NOT to find a firm job 1L year.  And they pay 1Ls more than 2Ls for the summer.  Betcha didn't know that, right?"  6. "Buy all the study guides you want.  The bookstore is happy to take them back, even after they've been opened and written in, photocopied, torn, and shredded."  7. "Everyone loves a gunner!"  8.  "I'd love to take you out to meet some of my friends, but you know 1L curfew is 10PM, right?"  9.  "Here's the criminal law outline I used.  If some of it sounds wrong, don't worry.  It's not like I went through and changed all of the important words to something else, or anything like that.  You mean you didn't know the penalty for burglary is execution by poison dart?"  10.  "No, no, no  you're SUPPOSED to wear this nametag with your LSAT score on it!"

      "School starts in just a few days, and I'm really getting nervous.  I enjoy your glib attempts at humor -- especially the song parodies -- but, seriously, what real advice can you give me to stop my knees from shaking and my palms from sweating?  I'm desperate here."  Thanks for the question, imaginary friend.  It's a good one.  A year ago I was pretty nervous too.   Although a check of my archives seems to show I wasn't admitting it to the world.  I don't know if what I have to share is really advice -- it's just observations I think might help, even just a little bit.  We'll see:  1. I think deep down everyone's nervous.  Some people just hide it better than others.  If they're not nervous starting a whole new experience like law school, moving to a new city, there's probably something wrong with them anyway.  2. This sounds weird, but, being at law school, you kind of start to get the feeling that maybe law students in general weren't the "coolest" kids in high school and in undergrad.  Not everyone, but I think probably the average law student is a little less "cool."  But, anyway, so in a group of on-average less-cool people, I kind of found that the threshold for coolness is lower than we're used to.  It's easier to be cool when most people aren't, and the "cool" standard ends up falling so far, that even if you were never cool before, you might be cool at law school.  This may not make any sense to anyone not living inside my brain, but if it does, maybe it's a little reassuring -- just because you don't think you were cool before doesn't mean you can't be cool at law school.  3. But most people I've met at law school are good people.  Nice people, kind-hearted people, friendly people.  They're all just people.  You'll be fine, imaginary friend.  If not on day one, then on day two.  But don't worry.  And don't forget to buy your books before they sell out.

      What if movie reviewers also reviewed law school casebooks?  Criminal Law Written by Bill Boring and Dan Dull 1,239 pages  It should be a "Crime," and against the "Law" to print casebooks like "Criminal Law" -- A.O. Scott, New York Times CaseBook Review   "Criminal Law," the new casebook from the pens of Bill Boring and Dan Dull, opens today in law classrooms throughout the Northeast.  And, like many other books in its genre, "Criminal Law" suffers from the problem of too many characters, too much action, and not enough time to build up any sympathy for any of the major players.  It seemed like every ten pages, away would go the murderer, or the rapist, or the guy who tried to bring an unlicensed handgun to the discotecque.  And would be replaced by another protagonist, with barely time to get to know him before he would disappear as well.  If you like casebooks where one victim after another is paraded before your eyes, maybe this is the one for you.  But if you like well-crafted melodrama, well, Boring and Dull have not done their jobs.  What was perhaps the most baffling directorial decision was the idea to spend so much time on the judges in each of the portrayed cases.  As if the man wearing the robe (and it's always a man, it seems, especially in the 1700s) is more interesting than the people at the tables or wearing the handcuffs.  Judge after judge after judge, with no context for who they really are, no reason to care.  Except they're there.  In every scene.  Constantly.  For shock value, the beginning of the book does introduce some elements that are interesting to read -- but once the endless middle of the book approaches, we've been desensitized, and it's all the same.  What really hurt the book was the collaboration -- Boring and Dull never quite were able to mesh their voices into one, and, in fact, their contributing authors all add other elements of inconsistency that are almost too much to tolerate.  But the most egregious flaw in the book is what the authors called, "Notes and Questions."  It's one thing to make an audience wade through case after case, but to ask them vexing questions and then not provide the answers -- well, that's downright "criminal."  Do yourself a favor and wait until this one's out on DVD.   Excerpts from reviews around the country of "Criminal Law" --  "This book really got me excited about statutory rape!" -- Kobe Bryant  "I was disappointed we didn't make the final cut." -- Lyle and Eric Menendez  "I read the book in one sitting and loved it!" -- Your Criminal Law Professor

       urlLink Janeway  and JCA over at  urlLink Sua Sponte  could have a Lexis Points contest.  Janeway reports she has 6,750 and Sua Sponte has almost 6000.  I have 950.  We've all spent the same amount of time at school.  And I do use Lexis-Nexis for most of my research needs (sorry, Westlaw -- but Lexis wins because it also has news sources like the New York Times, and so it works for non-legal research (gasp!) also).  I know I've made some mention of this a few months ago -- but what are JCA and Janeway doing on Lexis that's giving them so many points?  And is it really worth the $20 Amazon gift certificate they'll get at the end.  OK, maybe it's more than $20, and so maybe it is worth it.  I guess there are just some people who can motivate themselves to enter all the contests, and sign on every day, and probably also have one of those credit cards that gives them frequent flyer miles and never use ATMs from another bank that charges them a dollar-fifty fee, and always turn their library books in on time.  And they'll end up winning a new car from Lexis-Nexis, and I'll end up with a $4 gift certificate to Pets.com.

      How many tactical errors can you find in the following exchange?  "We're going to go around the circle and have everybody introduce themselves to the group.  We'll start with you."  "Hi.  My name is Joe.  I'm originally from Chicago.  I graduated from the University of Cleveland three years ago, majoring in Comparative Literature.  Since then, I've been helping underprivileged youths in third-world countries by serving in the Peace Corps.  The reason I'm at law school is because I want to learn how to work within the legal system to really effect change for children in these countries and make their lives better.  I also enjoy beer pong and softball.  In my spare time, I hope to get involved with the university orchestra and also work for a professor who's studying some of these international problems I'm really passionate about.  I'm also looking forward to making lots of great friends."  If you found at least 13 mistakes, great job.  If not, here's what you may have missed:  1. "I'm originally from Chicago."  What he ought to have said was "I'm from a suburb just outside of Chicago."  I don't know Chicago very well, but I have noticed that no one ever claims to be from the city itself.  Everyone's always from a suburb.  So I assume there's something awful enough about Chicago that admitting to being from the actual city is a definite no-no.  2. "The University of Cleveland" is not an Ivy League school.  So it's really better not to mention it at all.  Try just saying "I graduated from college," or "I graduated from school in the midwest," or, what might work best in this case, "I graduated from UC."  3. "...three years ago."  Makes you sound too old.  Try "...a couple of years ago," or something hard to calculate, like "...about 3% of the time that elapses between Halley's comet visits... ago."  4. Comparative Literature is not a law-school-approved major.  "The humanities" may be general enough that you won't be actually lying.  Or if you don't mind lying -- and you're in law school, so you probably don't -- "government" is a much better answer.  5. "...helping..."  That's an awfully weak verb.  Check out some of your classmates' resumes.  No one ever "helps" or "assists" or "collaborates," even if all they did was make photocopies.  They "fight" and "implement" and "manage."  Joe should say he "managed" children in underprivileged countries, or "fought for them," or "beat them into submission."  But not "helped."  Besides, nobody likes a humanitarian.  6. You know the old saying, "if you weren't a paralegal, keep your mouth shut."  Maybe that's not really an old saying.  But it should be.  Joe should get used to the following exchange: "You worked for the Peace Corps?  Well, at least you did  something .  7. This is an error of omission.  Joe won a silver medal for his work in Uganda.  That's the kind of stuff that might impress people.  So he shouldn't have left it out.  8. Another error of omission.  Joe's great-uncle is former Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart.  It's almost criminal for him not to mention that.  9. "spare time."  Ha.  10. "university orchestra."  Ha.  11. "work for a professor."  Uh oh.  Joe shouldn't be giving away his intentions.  He'll soon find rumors around the faculty that he likes to molest pet goldfish, or something like that, started by his classmates who want those plum research positions he's marked himself in line for.  12. "making lots of great friends."  This is Law School, not summer camp.  13. Joe should have at least another page of stuff to say.  Don't waste your first chance to impress your classmates by being brief and to-the-point.  *14.  This is a bonus one.  Joe scored a 177 on the LSAT.  He should definitely find a way to squeeze that in somehow.

      Harvard sent us an e-mail today regarding their recent installation of "Spam Assassin" on their mail servers, which will flag Spam as such, and allow us to filter is out.  All sounds fine -- except I was a bit disheartened by one of the FAQs on the website they referred us to:  "Will messages from Harvard groups be labeled as Spam?"  "No.  Any message which comes from an account with harvard.edu in the address is white listed and will not be labeled as Spam."  Well, that decreases its usefulness, because, actually, Harvard groups send me the bulk of the spam I get.  :)  (I can't really blame them -- I signed up for most of the organizations that bombard me with mail -- didn't sign up for Career Services, but some of that is kind of useful; but I only have myself to blame for most of the other stuff.  "Event in six weeks!  Mark your calendars!"  Right.)

      For the night before orientation, if there are any 1Ls-to-be reading this:  'Twas the night before law school And all through my head I was seeing disaster I was filling with dread I thought, "I'll never cut it," And "why am I here?" "Can I really survive this?" All I felt was the fear Fear of not being perfect Fear of not having fun Fear of wasting three years That will cost me a ton But I woke up that morning And looked all around At the faces all thinking The same thoughts I'd found All their fears were exactly The same ones as mine And we took a deep breath And we all turned out fine

      I expect this should be the last post about the blackout, but I figured I may as well try and get a song parody out of it.  "Blackin' Out" (to the tune of Billy Joel's "Movin' Out")  Anthony works in the grocery store Throwing his meat in the garbage But Mama Leone's serving sushi next door And there's a line twenty-deep for her bathroom They say a man in Cleveland coughed and we go black-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack Or that is the theory now  First we just blame the Canadians You know all they do is cause trouble And it seems such a waste of food That leftover crap I saved Ice cream's heating up cause we're blackin out.  We're blackin' out, oh oh...  Sergeant OLeary is walkin the beat Arresting the looters at Denny's They're stealing ninety-nine cent burgers As the bank goes untouched They're putting twenties aside to chase pennies They say it's not another terrorist attack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack-ack That's scheduled late this fall  And the subways stopped and the gas won't pump At least we can still drink the water And at Ohio's Cedar Point They're stuck in a coaster loop Hanging a hundred feet up 'cause we're blackin out.  We're blackin' out, oh oh...  No one's ever gonna visit Cleveland-land-land-land-land-land Like they ever did before But at least in a day we got power back Before we were killed in a riot And it seems such a waste of meat It seems such a waste of cheese Landfills will be filling up cause we're blackin out.  We're blackin' out, oh oh...

      I took the three blackout-related posts from yesterday and synthesized them into one reasonably-coherent 1200 word thing.  There's a few new funny lines in here, but I wouldn't really call it "new" so much as mostly a cut-and-paste.  But here it is anyway.  And I'll have a song parody or something else later tonight.  "Blackout!"  27 hours without power.  Makes an 8-hour take-home exam seem like cake.  I came back home to New York just in time for "Blackout 2003."  The news radio station I was tuned to on the Fisher-Price "My First Radio" I dug up in my closet had apparently navigated the legal process with ease and had the phrase trademarked by 5 hours into the event, and was trying to use it as much as possible.  "You're listening to non-stop coverage of Blackout 2003, here on the Blackout 2003 news leader, bringing you commercial-free Blackout 2003 information for all of you affected by Blackout 2003 and anyone else interested in Blackout 2003 and its aftermath."  The competing news radio station I switched to at around 8 hours in was using the phrase "Great Blackout 2003" instead.  Coming next year - Blackout 2004: The Klumps.  Besides missing the stats from Mark Prior's complete game for the Cubs this afternoon on one of my fantasy teams because he was on the bench and, without power, I couldn't get on the Internet to rotate him into the lineup for his start today, I believe I'm no worse for the wear.  An observation, after spending too many of the last 27 hours listening to the radio and thanking the divine spirits I'm not in Cleveland: New York thinks it's really special.  It's great that we got through a night of no power with only one instance of looting (and even that: a shoe store in Brooklyn (Payless.  Pay a lot less.  Pay nothing at all.)? Be honest: if you were going to loot during a blackout, would you really choose to loot a shoe store instead of, say, an electronics store, a jewelry store... or perhaps an adult novelty store?), fewer arrests than on a usual night, not too many car accidents, some added fires but all of them caused by morons incorrectly using candles rather than widespread arson, and no riots in the streets - but does this really make us so special?  All night, I kept hearing things like: "If not for the resilience and unbelievable brilliance and physical attractiveness of New Yorkers, Blackout 2003 could have ended in tragedy.  But, because New Yorkers are amazing people, we've shown the world how blackouts really ought to be handled;" "This is New York at its very best, the people of New York demonstrating how they truly are one-of-a-kind, just like Blackout 2003 is one-of-a-kind, and this news radio station is one-of-a-kind as well;" and "The real lesson of Blackout 2003 is not about power grids or electricity; it's about a city, its people, and what a great place New York is and how even the terrorists know, if there's one city in the world that you want to attack, it's got to be New York.  Oh, and Washington too I guess.  But New York is so much better."  Do the people in New Jersey and Connecticut leave their neighbors to perish on street corners? Kick the blind and tease the deaf?  Set monuments and national parks ablaze? Because that's sort of how it sounded. I'm all for pride in where you live, and the people you live with, but is acting civilly and responsibly during a blackout really so extraordinary? Are there any other options for coping with a blackout besides stopping carefully at intersections without signals and being kind to the people around you? Are New Yorkers really all that kind and patient compared to other people?  I wasn't so sure about that.  Yet all night long, politicians, news anchors, people on the street... all of them talking about what a great night this was for New York, and how we really showed the world how great we are.  The power went out.  We didn't kill each other.  Is this really so thrilling?  After the blackout ended, I took my grandmother home (she lives 5 minutes away but had been staying with me and my parents since yesterday; our house was cooler - I mean in the temperature sense, not the does-the-furniture-have-plastic covers sense, of course) and helped her empty her refrigerator and freezer of any food that had spoiled.  The food museum is now closed.  Her freezer was filled with artifacts covering the evolution of food over the last 50 years. The Mezozoic shelf included some chopped liver which, in the blackout (excuse me, I mean "Blackout 2003"), had separated into solid, liquid, and brand new organism; a first-edition salisbury steak TV dinner; something made of tofu before tofu was fashionable; matzoh balls from the matzoh meal fiasco of 1956; and egg drop soup -- which finally answered the question of what came first, the chicken or the egg (the chicken first appeared on the next shelf down, so we now know it appeared about 10 years after the egg did). The Paleozoic shelf included some chopped turkey, a vegetable dumpling, and a cinnamon roll complete with its original packaging (a rare find!). From the present-day era, Olive Garden leftovers in the original bag, Haagen-Dazs chocolate soup, some brownies, half a gyro, and some no-longer-frozen yogurt.  The exhibit starts from scratch tomorrow. By winter, no one will be able to tell the freezer had ever been emptied.  I've been evading the real issue so far in this column, I know.  We had a blackout.  We're law students. The natural question: who can we sue?  I've started making a list:  1. The power company. Too obvious, but we have to start somewhere. We pay them for power, they didn't deliver. An open and shut case.  2. The government. Under the takings clause. They took our power away. So there.  3. McDonalds. If people weren't so fat, they wouldn't need as much electrical power to cool their extra-large houses with extra large door frames, to power their extra-large microwaves, to shine light on their extra-large bodies, to run their extra-large clothes-stretching machines in their closets. And because McDonalds is the cause of obesity, they are clearly liable here.  4. Class action suit against the news media on behalf of African-Americans. Why the heck is it called a *black* out? Everything bad is always Black. Black plague, Black Monday, black eye, black lung, black sheep, blackout. Whiteout is a helpful little paint that covers up mistakes. Blackout is a calamitous loss of electricity that causes all sorts of crappy things. We should sue the news media for perpetuating this racist term.  5. Microsoft. My computer was running about a dozen different Microsoft programs when it crashed, including a few I'm sure I've never even heard of. Clearly there must be some connection. (And, besides, think Deep Pockets!)  6. Paul Newman. His salad dressing went bad in my refrigerator. Why can't he make shelf-stable dressing? Bad man. Bad, bad man.  That's all I've got for now.  Air conditioning was a great invention.

      The one good thing about the blackout: it's giving me lots of stuff to write about.  In between my previous post and this one, I took my grandmother home (she lives 5 minutes away but had been staying with me and my parents since yesterday; no good for grandparents to be alone when no air conditioning and stuff like that) and helped her empty her refrigerator and freezer of any food that had spoiled.  The food museum is now closed.  Her freezer was filled with artifacts covering the evolution of food over the last 50 years.  The Mezozoic shelf included some chopped liver which, in the blackout, had separated into solid, liquid, and brand new organism; a first-edition salisbury steak TV dinner; something made of tofu before tofu was fashionable; matzoh balls from the matzoh meal fiasco of 1956, egg drop soup -- which finally answers the question of what came first, the chicken or the egg (the chicken first appeared on the next shelf down, so we now know it came about 10 years after the egg).

And because McDonalds is the cause of obesity, they are clearly liable here.  4. Class action suit against the news media on behalf of African-Americans.  Why the heck is it called a *black* out?  Everything bad is always Black.  Black plague, Black Monday, black eye, black lung, black market, black sheep, blackout.  Whiteout is a helpful little paint that covers up mistakes.  Blackout is a calamitous loss of electricity that causes all sorts of crappy things.  We should sue the news media for perpetuating this racist term.  5. Microsoft.  My computer was running about a dozen different Microsoft programs when it crashed, including a few I'm sure I've never even heard of.  Clearly there must be some connection.  (And, besides, think Deep Pockets!)  6. Paul Newman.  His salad dressing went bad in my refrigerator.  Why can't he make shelf-stable dressing?  Bad man.  Bad, bad man.

      27 hours without power.    Besides missing Mark Prior's complete game for the Cubs this afternoon because he was on my fantasy team's bench and, without power, I couldn't get on the Internet to rotate him into the lineup for his start today, I believe I'm no worse for the wear.  An observation, after spending too many of the last 27 hours listening to news radio: New York thinks it's really special.  I mean, it's great that we got through a night of no power with only one instance of looting (a shoe store in Brooklyn -- just an aside--now be honest: if you were going to loot during a blackout, would you really choose to loot a shoe store instead of, say, an electronics store, or a jewelry store?), fewer arrests than on a usual night, not too many car accidents, mostly just *accidental* fires caused by candles rather than widespread arson, and no riots in the streets, but does this really make us so special?  All night, I kept hearing things like, "the spirit of New York shined through this evening, as we triumphantly came through the terrible blackout," "New Yorkers are out helping their fellow New Yorkers, and letting the world know what a wonderful city this is," "This has proven to me just how resilient New Yorkers are, and how New Yorkers truly are special people," "People giving rides to their neighbors, cars being extra careful at intersections with no signals... New York at its very best, the people of New York demonstrating how they truly are one-of-a-kind...."  Were the people in New Jersey and Connecticut running each other over on purpose?  Leaving their neighbors to perish on street corners?  Kicking babies and tripping the elderly?  Setting monuments and parks ablaze?  Because that's sort of how it sounded.  I'm all for pride in where you live, and the people you live with, but is acting civilly and responsibly during a blackout really so extraordinary?  Are there really other options for coping with a blackout than by stopping carefully at intersections without signals?  Yet all night long, from politicians, from news anchors, from people being interviewed, all of this talk about New York being extra-special.  If I wasn't from here... well... I'd probably hate this place.

      Got an e-mail today telling us about a new online biographical information system that we should use to update our address/phone/etc.  So I just did.  And one of the instructions on the online form (I swear this is real) is:   "If you wish to change your ethnicity information, please fill in a Change of Ethnicity Form at the Registrar's Office, Griswold 100."  There's a "Change of Ethnicity Form."  Wow.  Besides Michael Jackson, who would possibly need this form?  "Well, over summer vacation, I decided I'm black" is a great conversation starter -- but did they really have a need for this form?  Were they overwhelmed by requests for people's ethnicities on file to be changed that they felt they had to create this form and publicize its existence for us, tell us where it can be found....  Of course, like we can't get our grades online, apparently we can't change our ethnicity online either....  [Random unrelated--but probably grotesquely offensive--thought I just want to post before I forget it and it disappears into the ether: one of my friends is working for a magazine that's having him write a story about plays coming out that are related to September 11th.  A line you probably won't see in the article: "...it's expected that some of these 9/11-related plays will take flight, but some will unfortunately crash and burn...." [...I can hear the sound of readers clicking to go elsewhere...]

      An acrostic poem about a law firm interview.  S is for the suit that cost me way too much to buy U is for the underwear that, trust me, matches the suit M is for the mutual fund I could invest in after a summer's earnings M is for the mailed tuition bill that reminds me the mutual fund thing won't be happening E is for the estate tax; just some advance planning R is for the resume that has no typos.  Except the one I haven't found yet.  A is for the answers to the interview questions that you ask me S is for the shoes that match the suit S is for the socks that match the shoes that match the suit O is for the organizations I joined just to impress you C is for the cufflinks I couldn't afford to buy to match the suit I is for the interview itself A is for the ascot.  I don't know what an ascot is. T is for the tie that matches the socks that match the shoes that match the suit E is for the elevator that got stuck on the way to the interview and made me miss it.

      A COLLECTION OF ADVICE FOR INCOMING 1LS  Okay, this is going to be a work in progress here.  I'm going to gather a bunch of the advice I've given about the beginning of law school (nothing on final exams, summer jobs, or any of that stuff is catalogued here -- just stuff useful when you start) on my weblog into one list, so law students who start school this month don't necessarily have to go wading through the archives (although I'd be delighted if you would go wading through the archives, I really would).  Here goes:   urlLink Some questions from 1Ls-to-be about law school stuff, and my responses    urlLink Lots more 1L Q&A    urlLink Advice on raising your hand in class and balancing school and life    urlLink Advice about getting useless advice from 2Ls and 3Ls    urlLink Stuff I wished someone had told me before starting school    urlLink Sarcastic orientation tips    urlLink Classifying the types of classmates you'll find    urlLink Mocking the assortment of journals you can join    urlLink What the Socratic Method is like    urlLink Study groups    urlLink Outlines and note-taking    urlLink On assigned seating   And, finally, when you think it's just not worth it,  urlLink Ramblings on why I like law school ,  urlLink Keeping it in perspective , and  urlLink My favorite song parody I wrote all year

      My watch seems to be running faster and faster lately.  I set it 3 or 4 minutes ahead, and now it's like 7 or 8 minutes fast.  I guess it just be getting better and better at telling time, you know, practice makes perfect, it's just getting more efficient... no one's laughing, are you?  If you're in New York City with nothing much to do, and looking to see a play in the Fringe Festival -- check out "Mock the Knife" playing at the Red Room (85 East 4th Street -- between Bowery and 2nd Avenue) Wednesday 8/13 4:45-5:45, Sunday 8/17 1:45-2:45, Wednesday 8/20 9-10, Thursday 8/21 6:30-7:30, and Saturday 8/23 1:45-2:45.  I'm plugging it here because it's written by a friend of mine and he stars in it.  If you go, you can win me friend brownie points and tell him I sent you (he's the one who eats soap and butter in the show; the other actor only eats butter).  Seriously.  I went today and liked.  Also saw the independent movie "Camp," about kids at a performing arts camp.  Saw it mostly because one of the actors with a very minor role -- the camp director -- directed a show I was in during undergrad.  The movie's filled with pretty good musical numbers, but I can't say I really loved the film overall.  It seems like the kind of thing that could turn into a TV series on Bravo.  The CD is probably pretty listenable though.  Law school stuff.  Hmmm.  I'll have to get back to you on that.  It's Sunday.  It's summer.  You shouldn't be thinking about law school.  Go out and play.

      For anyone who's keeping track, my DC job came to an end yesterday and I'm now back in NY for a bit until back to school sometime towards the end of the month.  So comments about the subway really will be about the Subway and not the Metro, and probably no more restaurant haikus.  A lot of action on the Princeton Review message boards regarding thoughts about professors -- for whatever reason, Harvard students seem to dominate this thing, but this applies to anyone really.  It all seems sort of unnecessary -- you have no choice, you get who you get, and you'll survive.  Everyone in your section is in the same boat you are, and anything anyone tells you isn't anything you won't figure out on the first day of class anyway.  "She's boring" usually becomes pretty clear pretty quickly, "He's socratic" certainly makes itself known pretty much immediately, "She's brilliant" should be pretty easy to spot on day one....  So it's not like it's really earth-shattering to find out anything about your professors in advance.  That said, I'm being kind of disingenuous here, because I've been happy to share anything I've heard or experienced regarding certain professors with anyone who's e-mailed me.  But it's not like anything I have to say is particularly extraordinary or anything that doesn't become obvious ten minutes into the first day of class.  It's interesting, actually -- that first impression a professor makes is really important; seems to me that it sets the tone for the rest of the semester, I think.  Seem brilliant, and your students will think you are, even if you're maybe not, and for a while probably give you the benefit of the doubt.  Scare people on day one and maybe they'll think you're strict for a while, even if you're usually not.  Call on some students at random on the first day, and maybe some of them will even do the reading!  Amazing!  [Excuse me while I abruptly change the subject.  Apologies for a less-than-graceful transition.]  At some point in the next couple of weeks, before I go back to school, I need to buy an "interview suit."  My only suit right now is black, and isn't really even a suit.  It's a jacket and pants that are both black and made by the same company out of the same material.  So it passes for a suit.  But they say black suits aren't right.  I need a gray suit, I guess.  Maybe navy blue, but I don't like navy blue, so I'm going to go with gray.  I need shoes too.  The only "dress shoes" I have right now are made by Nike.  I'm totally serious.  It seems strange to me that I seem to have missed the whole suit-buying stage of becoming an adult, but I never really needed one that was more serious than what I could piece together from the random jackets and pants I've got, that all sort of match.  Ties and shirts I've got more than enough.  But I don't think it's smart for me to fake a suit for interviews.  I have to actually buy one.  And probably not the cheapest one I can find, although I'd kind of like to.  Maybe I can get on that new show on Bravo and they can tell me what kind of suit to buy that will look good and not make me feel like a little kid stealing his dad's clothes.  I haven't actually seen that show, but I hear it's funny.  Wearing a suit, instead of making me feel like I'm an adult, makes me feel like I'm completely out of place.  But I guess any setting where I'm supposed to feel like an adult I feel kind of out of place -- I feel like I relate well to adults, but I'm not "one of them" yet.  At work, I can be someone's colleague, and function fine in that capacity, but I still have no problem with them telling me what to do and being bossy, because I'm just a kid.  They're adults.  Although perhaps the willingness to be ordered around would make me a fine law firm associate....

      I went to a restaurant called "Potbelly Sandwich Works" this evening.  The sandwiches on their menu: Turkey Breast, Italian, Vegetarian, Pizza, Smoked Ham, Tuna Salad, Chicken Salad, Meatball, Roast Beef, and Peanut Butter & Jelly.  Things you can add to "any sandwich" for 50 cents -- extra mushrooms, extra cheese, extra ounce of meat, or extra marinara sauce.  I wonder: how many people have ever ordered any of those things on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  :)  An extra ounce of meat!  Ha!  (This kept me amused for way too long... much to the non-amusement of my friend I was eating with...)  Also, random fact of the day: the average 30-second commercial spot costs $343,000 to produce.  That's a lot of money!

      I meant to wait until tomorrow to post this, but I just couldn't wait.  Exactly one year ago tomorrow, I decided it would be cool to start a weblog about life as a law student.  Mostly to force me to write something every day, even if it was something stupid.  And also because I thought it'd be nice to be able to look back at the end of however long I'd keep the weblog going and have a collection of my thoughts, observations, and random attempts at humor.  As the counter started to rise a bit, I realized it was also pretty cool that I could use the weblog to share my experiences with other law students, people thinking about law school, people who once went to law school a long time ago, or people with nothing better to do than read about someone in law school, and that I could maybe provide some advice or at least a way for them to know that someone else finds this funny too, and that they're not all alone in the scary law school unknown.  Hopefully, I've amused and entertained a bit over the past year, and maybe even made law school, or the idea of law school, a little less scary for a few people.  From my end, writing this has been extraordinarily rewarding -- it's gotten me writing something each day and given me an outlet for the random thoughts that pop into my head so that they don't just disappear into the ether, and it's introduced me to a whole bunch of awesome people I've had the opportunity to exchange e-mails with or meet, a few of whom I'd certainly count as friends.  If you're reading, thanks for reading.  I'm just humbled that there's an audience out there, whatever the size, that's interested in what I've got to say.  I do appreciate it, and hope I've done enough to deserve your readership.  Tell me what else I can do to make this better for you.  Or don't, and just keep reading.  Either way.  And happy one-year weblog anniversary to me.  It's been fun so far.  And hopefully will continue to be for at least a little while longer.  I look forward to typing a similar message again next year.  Thanks.

      I've been waiting all day to write this.    At my job today, I encountered some large sheets of foam insulation.  And the company name printed on the back?  Celotex.  Celotex!  People who've taken a Civil Procedure class -- or at least people who've taken a civil procedure class and used the same casebook I did -- will recognize this name instantly!  Celotex!  They're not just a made-up company in the casebook -- they actually make something real!  This excited me way too much.  None of my co-workers shared in my excitement.  Please share in my excitement.  P.S. I realize that "At my job today, I encountered some large sheets of foam insulation" might be a sentence no one else in the world has ever used before.  And that it makes my job sound awfully mysterious.  I kind of like that.  P.P.S. Celotex!

      Courtesy of the incoming Harvard 1L over at  urlLink Undeniable Dilemma , I'll point to the Harvard 1L  urlLink information page , in case any Harvard 1Ls-to-be are reading my site and haven't discovered it yet.  It's not particularly chock-full of information -- professors and book lists for each section, and a generic welcome letter.  The kind of stuff I recall was sent to me via the always-reliable postal service around this time last year.  But it's GREAT to see they're putting more and more stuff on the web.  Our grades aren't on the web yet.  Kind of hard to believe.  But, anyway, it's great that there's this information page for incoming 1Ls, sparse as it may be.  And it doesn't tell them what section they're in, so it doesn't actually allow them to figure out who their professors are yet.  But still, it's something.  The professors, by the way, are mostly the same ones who taught 1L courses this past year, with a few names I haven't heard (visiting professors?) and a few who taught last year who don't seem to be doing so again.  But most look like a nice mix of younger and older professors for each section, with some well-known names scattered in there.  Three of the professors I had for my 1L classes seem to be teaching again, but two aren't.  TJ over at Undeniable Dilemma says: "I only hope that I'm not the only pre-1L with no plans whatsoever to start buying text books to get a 'head start'."  Oh, gosh, I hope so too.  I don't know anyone who did that.  Most professors don't go in order, don't start at the beginning, skip around... have different ways of explaining things than what's in the book... expect you to read focused on certain aspects... it seems awfully silly / useless / wasteful to read your casebooks before you start.  Although you may want to buy them right away when you get on campus -- if you want to save 25% and get 'em used, the used ones sell out fast, at least at Harvard.  Honestly, though, the two books I bought used I probably shouldn't have bothered.  One was so marked up with highlighters -- when I bought it I said to myself, "it won't be a big deal; only chapters 4 and 5 are highlighted," but it turned out we only used chapters 4 and 5... oops! -- that it was distracting, and the other was kind of falling apart.  Law school costs so much anyway; don't skimp on the casebooks.  If you find good used ones, great!  But if someone's burnt the edges of the pages and you can't read the last word one every line... might not be worth it.  Apologies that this post is of somewhat less utility if you're not about to be a 1L at Harvard -- I recognize that, and will try and conjure up something with broader appeal before the sun sets.

      Here's some advice for incoming 1Ls: update your resume.  Now.  Before you get to school.  When career services starts their onslaught in October or November, it's a pain to find the time and energy to do it then, so you may as well do it now.  Leave some room at the top for Law School stuff, but get everything else up to date, less than a page long, lots of white space, no typos... no big deal, but you'll be happy come November that you got a head start.

      I went hiking at Great Falls (the Maryland side, not the Virginia side, in case anyone really cares) with a friend today.  One interesting note (interesting to me, at least):  The park is a "trash-free" facility, which means that whatever you bring in, you take out; there are no trash cans, not even in the bathroom (there's also no paper towel in the bathroom; I presume there's toilet paper, but I didn't have the occasion to check).  Yet there's a refreshment stand, that sells things that absolutely would need trash cans to dispose of them (soda cups, and bottles, ice cream wrappers, napkins, little plates for hamburgers, etc, plastic silverware...).  So they give you things, but they don't give you a trash can to throw them out in.  For whatever reason, it doesn't bother me if they want to be trash-free and not let you throw out the water bottles you come in with, that's fine -- but if they're going to sell things that need to be thrown out, it seems awfully inconsiderate not to let you throw them out, and make you take them with you.  They've given them to you.  And they've charged for entry, not that that's really relevant.  I wonder if this really decreases trash, or if people toss things on the ground or try to flush them down the toilet instead.  I think the policy's pretty silly.

      "The Registrator" (to the tune of Billy Joel's "The Entertainer")  I am the registrator And I say which class you're in The schedule dictator Some will lose and some will win Perhaps I'll treat you kindly Give the ones for which you strive But a random whim and your life is grim Cause you get a class you'll never pass And it meets Friday at five  I am the registrator I don't like you one bit I have an extra syllable If I cut it, it won't fit Oh, they beg me to make changes To switch the class around Act like a jerk, but a bribe might work Pass me dollar bills and the course that fills A space may soon be found  I am the registrator So when classes all conflict It's just my way of having fun With the choices I restrict I don't know data entry All the numbers go in wrong So you do it right, but then late tonight You log on and see that because of me You're in a class you don't belong  I am the registrator And you know it could be worse This song could be much longer But this is the last verse You shouldn't get your hopes up Your favorite course will close And I'd like to help but I never help I'm a bureaucrat; a poor one at that And that's the way it goes.

      Fascinating  urlLink article  from this weekend's NY Times Magazine on Steven Levitt, an economics professor at Chicago tackling interesting questions like why the crime rate fell in the '90s and how to tell if a teacher is giving her students the answers to standardized test questions.

      This is stupid, and I fear I sound unfortunately whiny, but I just want to respond to something  urlLink Waddling Thunder  just posted, regarding his weblog's anonymity:  "As I think Jeremy once noted, if someone is going to hold a blog against you, then you don't really want any contact with that person."  Uh, I don't know about that.  And I don't think I said that.      What I do think -- and this is probably what Waddling Thunder means -- is that if a potential employer were to read this, and decide -- perfectly legitimately! -- that he didn't want to hire me, that's totally fair, and it probably just indicates it's not the right job for me.  And I'm totally fine with that.  The reason I'm not anonymous is because I don't write anything I'm uncomfortable having my name attached to, and because I do write some stuff I'm actually pretty pleased to have written.  I want credit for the good stuff, and, frankly, I'd be delighted if every potential employer read everything I've written here.  I think regular readers have probably gotten a decent sense of who I am, and I think I'm not a bad guy, and this probably does a better job of selling me than I do in an interview.    This is one of the posts for which I wish had a comments link.  But if you have got comments, I'd love to hear 'em...

      900 words on researching law firms:  Its already August.  And, as everyone knows, August is Family Eye Care Month, Foot Health Month, Harvest Month, International Air Travel Month, Medic Alert Month, National Catfish Month, National Child Support Enforcement Month, National Golf Month, National Parks Month, National Water Quality Month, Peach Month, Spinal Muscular Atrophy Awareness Month, and, of course, Watermelon Month.  And, as the Office of Career Services begins to remind me with its e-mails, its Update Your Resume and Start Researching Law Firms Month.  So I bought the latest Vault guide.  And then, three hours later, realized I get access for free on the career services website.  And they wouldnt let me return it, because, like our tuition, there are no refunds.  And the Vault guide was interesting, but it seemed like the only way firms could be distinguished from each other were regarding the existence of a subsidized cafeteria, a lavish internal staircase, or the dress code on Fridays during the summer.  Not that helpful.  So I went to the NALP directory ( urlLink www.nalpdirectory.com ), lauded by career services and 3Ls alike as being a great source for firm information.  And, of course, it was much better.  I figured the first step in narrowing down my list of firms would be to check if I fit their hiring criteria.  The differences between firms on this dimension are (predictably) astounding:  Outstanding academic credentials; Self-starting and motivated with academic achievements; Strong academic performance; Strong academic achievement; Demonstrated evidence of high academic performance; We look for candidates who have achieved academic excellence; Strong academic achievement; Outstanding academic and non-academic achievements; Outstanding academic record; Academic achievement; We seek JD candidates with a record of academic excellence; We look for candidates with strong academic credentials; Success in academic and other pursuits.  Clearly theres a trend here.  So, having eliminated every major firm from my list, I decided to compare the pro bono policies at different firms.  After all, beyond the consideration of whether I want to do a lot of pro bono work or not, a firm with a commitment to pro bono seems likely to me to be the kind of place that cares about people, and, by extension, its employees, or at least those employees with demonstrated evidence of outstanding academic achievement.  Firms on pro bono:  All attorneys are encouraged to participate in our pro bono program; [The firm] strongly encourages its lawyers to devote time to pro bono legal work, and the full resources of the Firm are available to serve pro bono clients; [Our firm] takes great pride in its long-standing commitment to public service. Our attorneys are strongly encouraged to participate in pro bono projects and to bring to each pro bono representation the same unwavering dedication, commitment to hard work, and legal excellence that they bring to all matters handled by the firm; The firm encourages attorney participation in litigation, corporate and real estate pro bono matters; [The firm] has a strong commitment to pro bono legal services by its lawyers; The Firm strongly encourages attorneys to dedicate their time and professional skills to pro bono work and community activities; [Our] lawyers are encouraged to devote firm time and resources to pro bono matters in which they are interested; We engage in public service, pro bono, and many law-related and charitable activities.  But of course the firms are all the same on these dimensions, my cynical-yet-practical imaginary visionary legal scholar and mentor has told me.  Theyre all competing for the same body of students, and are basically looking for the smartest, most competent people they can find.  And they know that everyones looking for a place that does some pro bono work, so they all talk about the work they do.  Theres nothing wrong with anything youve written so far  what do you expect?  The real way to distinguish one law firm from another, my young Jedi master, is by the words they use to describe their firm and its clients.  Ah, I hadnt thought of that, I replied, as my co-workers looked at me wondering why I was having a conversation with the wall.  And so I returned to the NALP directory:  [We] provide clients with a broad range of legal services; [We have] a long-standing tradition of providing the world's most prestigious financial institutions, Fortune 500 companies and other leading corporations with innovative solutions to complex legal and business issues; [Our] clients include multinational corporations and international financial institutions headquartered in the United States and abroad; [The firm has] numbered among its clients many of the leaders of American and international finance, commerce and industry; [T]he firm has worked on the largest and most complex business and financial transactions, as well as significant litigation for a broad range of clients that are leaders; [We] represent leading corporations, financial institutions, and other high-profile clients.  What really gets me is that its so much easier for the firms to make their decisions about us than it is for us about them.  After all, none of our resumes look at all alike, and you can tell everything about a person from a 20-minute interview.  But at least, since August is Foot Health Month, while were researching firms, well all have healthy feet.

      A very brief comment that will probably be amusing to only one of my readers.  I'm checking my e-mail at a computer in the library here at school, and decided to quickly check another weblog I sometimes link to written by a fellow HLS student.  And I notice there's all sorts of options on the page that aren't usually there.  Seems as if he must have posted from this machine earlier today and didn't log out.  I resisted any urge to tamper, of course, and did him a favor and logged him out.  But what a fun coincidence.

      Diary of an Interview  4:26 pm: I arrive at the Charles Hotel for my 4:40 interview.  Dozens of my classmates are in the lobby, all wearing dark suits.  Most of the ties I see are red.  Mine is blue.  Im screwed.  I find the chart with all of the firm names and the locations of the hospitality suites.  Im going to room 743.  I dont need to write that down.  Ill remember it.  734.  4:27 pm: Dozens of my classmates stream out of the elevator.  I dont know how they all fit.  I get in.  I press 4.  437.  Thats where Im going.  4:28 pm: No, thats not it.  I get back in the elevator.  7.  743.  Got it.  4:29 pm: I arrive at the hospitality suite, where they ask my name and tell me who Ill be meeting with.  They hand me a packet filled with brochures, pamphlets, and a one-page bio of the guy Ill be meeting with in 11 minutes.  I have 11 minutes to read seventy-five pages about the firm.  Go.  4:30 pm: One piece of paper theyve handed me tells me my interviewer is in room 913.  Got it.  I leave the literature some other firm gave me in the lobby on a chair in the hospitality room, and head back to the elevator.  4:31 pm: Oh, hi.  Yes, Im interviewing with them too.  Room 913.  Oh, you interviewed with the same guy four hours ago?  Oh, he was a purple three-eyed monster?  Oh, thanks.  Yeah, good luck with your Wachtell interview.  4:32 pm: Back in the elevator.  I press 9.  I get out and walk the wrong way, circling the entire floor of the Charles.  I eventually double back and find the room.  The hallway is filled with people dressed just like me.  Except their ties are red, and my tie is blue.  4:34 pm: Sweat is beading on my upper lip.  Im glad I took a napkin from the hospitality room.  4:35 pm: My fly is open.  Didnt notice that before.  Lets fix that.  Zip.  4:36 pm: Oh, hi.  Did I finish reading all the brochures?  No, but you did?  Yes, thats right, I should probably talk lower here in the hallway.  4:37 pm: Someone down the hall has just knocked on the door.  Its three minutes early.  And this whole knocking thing seems pretty rude.  4:38 pm: I swear, a girl just bent down over the keyhole and cleared her throat.  She cleared her throat into the keyhole in order to get the guys attention without knocking.  People are weird.  4:39 pm: Someone else has knocked.  I feel funny knocking.  4:40 pm: Everyone else has knocked.  4:41 pm: I knock.  A voice from inside says, one minute.  4:42 pm: Its been one minute.  Cleared-her-throat-in-the-keyhole girl just knelt down on the ground and blew air into the crack under the door to get the interviewers attention.  4:43 pm: The door opens.  The interviewer and my classmate are laughing heartily.  He must have liked her.  I have to follow a funny person?  Goodness.  Hello, Im A Lawyer.  Hello, Im Really Nervous.  Come on in and have a seat.  4:44 pm: Someone told me never to sit down until the interviewer sits down, so I stand there awkwardly for three seconds until he sits.  I put my resume folio on the table.  Then on the floor.  Then back on the table.  4:45 pm: So, how are you? Good, this is an easy one.  I know the answer to this one.  Im good.  How are you?  Good.  Oh, great, were connecting quite well here so far.  4:46 pm: I see on your resume that fourteen summers ago, you played in a sandbox.  Tell me about that.  Theres twenty-six unique askable items on my resume.  He has just picked the one I ranked twenty-sixth on my list of which items I most wanted to talk about.  Great.  4:47 pm: Thats great.  His tie is red.  My tie is blue.  Im screwed.  I also see on your resume that you went to college.  How was that?  Glad he got specific with that one.  Well, I thought college was a great experience.  I wippledly hoppled.  Thats my best anecdote.  The wippledly hoppling story.  Always gets a laugh.  He doesnt laugh.  And then I snickeldy trifled.  No reaction.  Plan B.  And, in one class, I blah blah blah blah blah ---  Stop talking.  Youre not making any sense.  Stop talking, take a breath, and start over.  Blah blah blah blah ---  Hes not listening, Im not even listening.  I dont know what Im saying.  Blah blah blah.  4:48 pm: Thats interesting.  Neither of us have any idea what I just said.  So, do you have any questions I can answer for you?  Uh oh.  Theres 12 minutes left, and hes already pulled out his trump card.  This cant be good.  Actually, I noticed on your web site --- Indicate youve done research.  Check.  That you have a very strong fiddledy floo practice, which Im very interested in --- Say what youre interested in.  Check.  And I was wondering if thats a place where a lot of people start out.  4:49 pm:  Actually, we dont do fiddledy floo.  We do bliddley bopple bollywock.  I mixed up my firms.  Jeez.  That was dumb.  Oh.  You dont do fiddeledy floo?  Not even just the floo?  What about internationally, in countries like Gobble, Gibble, and Grog?  I figured Id at least let him know I knew where the international offices were.  4:50 pm: Well, not in Gibble.  And we dont have any offices in Gobble and Grog.  You might be thinking of Toronto, where we are planning to expand next fall.  Yes, I must have meant Toronto.  I hear its a lovely place.  I hate Canada.  Yes, me too.  4:51 pm: So.  What to do.  Lets see.  I went to Harvard.  I had Professor Zipple.  What about you?  I had his wife, Professor Zapple.  Shes wonderful.  I hated her.  Me too.  4:52 pm: Did you hear someone knock?  No.  I think I did.  Yes, me too.  He stands up.  This isnt good.  It was a pleasure to meet you.  Best of luck with all of your future endeavors.  This surely sounds like hes never planning to see me again.  That cant be good language.  Id shake your hand, but I hate you.  Thats also not real favorable talk.  Go away now.  At least hes being subtle about it.  4:53 pm: The hallways are empty, and will remain so for seven more minutes, until the good interviews end. I go back to the hospitality suite, pick up a foam squeeze toy in the shape of a pen, and a pen in the shape of a piece of foam, and go on my merry way.  Dont think Ill be getting a callback from this one.

      Just got an e-mail about an annual law school "charity bash," a social event at a bar where the proceeds go to charity.  From the e-mail:  Proceeds go to: "Kick Start for Kidneys" Finding a Cure For Childhood Kidney Disease  "Kick start for kidneys???"  That sounds awfully painful.  I don't think kicking kids in the kidneys is going to help them much.  Kidneys don't seem like the kind of organ that needs to be "kick-started."  What a poor name choice for a charity, in my humble opinion.

      World's Worst Interview: The Before-It-All-Starts Vision in my Imagination  INTERVIEWER: Welcome.  Sit down.  (I sit down.  I miss the chair.  Oops.  I get up.  I sit down.  Deep breath.)  INTERVIEWER: Hope you're alright there.  How are the interviews going so far?  ME: Just starting.  This is my first.  INTERVIEWER: And you're in for a long journey?  ME: I guess.  INTERVIEWER: So I see on your resume that you enjoy walking on hot coals.  ME: That isn't on my resume.  INTERVIEWER: So you don't enjoy walking on hot coals?  ME: No.  INTERVIEWER: Then why does it say so on your resume?  ME: I guess you're not looking at the right resume.  INTERVIEWER: Are you telling me I'm doing something wrong?  ME: I guess.  I've got a fresh copy of my resume, if you'd like.  INTERVIEWER: I don't need your fresh copy of your resume.  I'll stick with the one I've got.  So it says here you're President of the Female Asian Medical Student Association.  ME: Uh, no.  That's definitely the wrong resume.  INTERVIEWER: Do you want a job with my firm?  ME: Uh, before I met you I did, yes.  INTERVIEWER: Then you need to answer the questions I ask you.  What's it like being an ex-con, 63-year-old first-generation Korean immigrant at Medical School?  ME: It's wonderful.  INTERVIEWER: And why do you want to work for a law firm?  ME: I find law school intellectually stimulating, and think I'd enjoy firm work.  INTERVIEWER: This says you're in medical school, not law school.  ME: Like I said, that's not my resume.  INTERVIEWER: And this isn't my tie.  ME: Huh?  INTERVIEWER: I was making a joke.  Do you not have a sense of humor?  ME: If that's the thing that's hurting me in an interview...  INTERVIEWER: Do you want me to hurt you in an interview?  Because I can.  Even if you're a world-ranked boxer.  ME: I'm not.  INTERVIEWER: So you lied on your resume?  ME: That's not my resume.  INTERVIEWER: So everything on here is a lie?  ME: Not a lie.  Just not stuff I've done.  INTERVIEWER: So it's all made up.  ME: As related to me, yes, I suppose so.  INTERVIEWER: Great.  So you're a liar without a sense of humor.  And you think we should hire you anyway?  ME: Uh... you're twisting my words.  INTERVIEWER: I think I've had about enough of you.  (he stands)  Best of luck on the rest of your interviews, and you'll hear from us within the next couple of days.  ME: Thanks for your time.  (exit)

      Happy Rosh Hashana to all those for whom it applies.  Happy Weekend to everybody else.  On-campus interviews start on Monday.  So I've carved out some time this weekend to research the firms a bit more than I already have and to think about some answers to questions I might get.  Things like "biggest weakness," "time you overcame a challenge," "where you see yourself in five years," etc.  Questions I hope I don't get, because they probably mean the interviewer is just going through the motions and asking the standard "how to conduct an interview" questions and not really listening to the answers, but that I think I should probably think through a bit, because I'm not the best at this stuff.  My ideal interview, honestly, would be where they ask me for my references and go call them to ask about me.  I think they'd probably do a better job of talking about me than I do.  I get flustered a bit in these things -- the pressure to start responding right away and not take three seconds to think through what I really want to say.  I just need to relax, to actually act like it's a real conversation, to not be afraid to be funny or interesting or honest.  I've been through an on-campus interviewing process before, when I was a senior in college and I interviewed for a bunch of jobs, mostly because I didn't know if law school was the right thing, and at least wanted to give myself a chance to get stolen away from the more-education plan.  And my first interview was with the (software) company I eventually got an offer with and worked at for two years (I did marketing stuff, not programming or anything like that -- but I'm sure I've talked about that at some point long ago on here).  8:30 in the morning on day one of interviews.  And the eight interviews after that one were all with consulting firms, and I didn't really want to be a consultant, and it showed.    The least-effective interview moment -- I was interviewing with a consulting firm, and the interviewer asked if I "would ever give up on a problem."  And I answered that I'd of course first do whatever I could do, enlist help, ask questions, try different tactics, but if it got to the point where it would be more useful for me to move onto something else, where I could actually add some value, and let someone else, who might bring a different set of tools to the problem, take over, then, yeah, I'd think it would make sense for me to give up.  And she said "a consultant never gives up" and that was pretty much that.  I still don't really know if I agree with her.  This process can't be easy for the interviewers.  Twenty minutes each with perhaps two dozen candidates, back-to-back-to-back-to-back, resumes that all look generally similar, grades that probably don't have a ton of variation.  There's no one here who, in the right context, can't certainly shine in a twenty-minute interview.  A connection, ask a good question, hit on something someone's comfortable talking about, and a conversation will get going, and everyone here is bright and articulate enough to acquit themselves well.  So I imagine that sorting us out is hard for the interviewers, and a lot of it is the intangibles -- did you connect with the interviewer, did you "click."  Were you"on" at that particular moment.  I had another fairly ineffective interview moment last year, when doing some phone interviews for jobs.  I interviewed with a non-profit that dealt with immigration issues -- mostly an informational interview, really; I had a connection, and just wanted to learn more about what they did... I just wasn't sure if it was an area I was interested in or not.  So the guy talking to me saw on my resume that I've written songs, and he asked me how my song writing relates to my possible interest in immigration issues.  In retrospect, the right answer of course is, "it doesn't really.  It's just something else I do."  But, especially on the phone, without physical cues, I found it hard to take that breath and think through an answer before saying something, and I said something like, "well, I suppose music can affect people, and make them happy, and if you're helping immigrants get settled in a new country, you're affecting them and making them happy too."  What a dumb answer.  It's nonsense, really.  That's the kind of answer I have to avoid, I guess.

      "Last-Minute Interview Tips"  I've been picking on the Office of Career Services a lot lately, but they're the ones scheduling all of these "tips sessions," so it's kind of their own fault.  On Thursday afternoon, I went to the Interview Tips panel, featuring hiring partners from three big law firms talking about what they look for in an interview.  Not unlike most events like these, the advice was well-meaning, but painfully predictable.  "We strongly encourage you to research our firm before the interview."  Thanks.  The following is a dramatization of the actual event.  The dialogue is not real.  Hiring Partner 1: "The key to a successful on campus interview is making a good impression on the person interviewing you.  You want to be able to talk intelligently about things on your resume, and show the interviewer that you would be a good asset to the firm.  It is important for you not to say stupid things."  Hiring Partner 2: "I agree with everything my colleague said.  In addition, you want to be appropriately groomed, dressed appropriately, and give appropriate answers to questions that would make us want to bring you down to our office for a call-back interview.  Being inappropriate in any way is not appropriate."  Hiring Partner 3: "I emphatically agree with everything my colleagues have said.  In addition, I emphatically suggest that you probably want to bring a copy of your resume with you to the interview, and I emphatically suggest that you probably want to try your best to answer whatever questions the interviewer asks you."  The hiring partners all agreed that interviewers may ask about anything on the resume, or anything not on the resume.  One example given was if a candidate "had a great experience with the Oakland Raiders this past summer" that might make for an interesting conversation topic in an interview.  Even more so if the interviewee is female.  One tip provided was that before the interview, candidates might want to check out the firm's web page and look at any "news flashes."  For instance, one firm bragged about getting a death row inmate executed after 18 years on death row.  I mean acquitted.  Oops.  Law school grades are apparently meaningless but important.  But all three hiring partners advised that we should bring up any "outlier grades" during the interview and explain them. Good thing all of my grades sucked.  Wouldn't want to have to be explaining any outliers.  Apparently, "nothing good can come out of a thank you note."  I think they mean anthrax.  (As I write that, I'm realizing that anthrax, like Monica Lewinsky, may have somehow lost its relevance sometime between that dude at the tabloid in Florida dying and right now.  It will take its place in the pile of discarded comedic material from history, right next to jokes about Pee-Wee Herman, and fake NASA abbreviations corresponding to the Challenger disaster.)  One hiring partner said that he expects some warmth when he tells people they have earned a call-back.  "It should be like a party in your phone," he did not say.  "Finding out you have a call-back should give you an orgasm," he did not say either.  The hiring partners all talked about how we shouldn't lie about what kind of law we want to practice because some fields are "hot," and some fields are "cold."  Instead, we should lie about what kind of law we want to practice because otherwise how will we ever answer the question they'll ask us about it.  I found it funny that they said "environmental law is cold."  Maybe in Canada.  But in California, it's quite temperate.  And in Ecuador, it's downright steamy.  One hiring partner said that they solicit opinions from everyone a recruit meets at the firm - partners, associates, paralegals, secretaries, janitors, and the man who operates the secret spy camera in all the hallways.  "We like to hear from everyone who lives their lives at [our firm]," he said.  I don't like to hear that people "live their lives" at this firm.  I'd much prefer they "spend their days" there, or "work reasonable hours" there.  A chunk of time was spent talking about questions that students should ask during interviews.  Asking "checklist" questions is bad - "what kind of training do you provide?" "what's the summer program like?" "when will this interview be over?" - but questions about things we're really interested in learning about are good.  But not things we can learn by reading the web site.  Or things that demonstrate a complete lack of knowledge about the firm -- "I don't speak German, and I'm worried that since you're based in Berlin I will have trouble."  "Oh, you're based in Cleveland.  Oops."  Or things that make you sound like a lazy good-for-nothing -- "What's the work-life balance like?  I don't enjoy working hard.  I'm a lazy good-for-nothing."  So what's the overall lesson here?  Don't be dumb.  Say sensible things, be polite, know about the firm before you interview.  And probably no gum-chewing.  Yeah, gum-chewing would be a no-no.  Cursing is probably out too.  And loud burping.  Inappropriate laughter.  Unmatching socks.  A large top hat.  A fake Scottish accent.   All bad.  I guess.

      Got some reading to do?  And just an hour to do it?  Then you need the Insta-Law-O-Matic Casebook Condenser.  The Insta-Law-O-Matic Casebook Condenser removes the following words from your casebook:  Court, precedent, statute, legislature, justice, judge, "your honor," law, laws, legal, illegal, legality, illegality, the letter "l," all Latin words, three-pronged test, dissent, appeal, appellate, obligation under the law, although, despite, because, all sentences longer than 10 words, all words longer than 10 letters, all paragraphs longer than 10 lines, all cases longer than 10 pages, all decisions by justices older than 10 years, all footnotes, all question marks and the questions that precede them, all parenthetical remarks, all case names, and, of course, the letter "v."  This reduces the typical 800-page casebook to a 4-page booklet, suitable for reading while on the toilet, eating a balanced breakfast, or on the way to your final exam.

      Today was the law school's organizations fair, where each of the 50 or so student organizations try to collect as many names as possible to add to an e-mail distribution list.  In order to get people to sign up, they give out candy.  The amount of organizations is staggering.  The amount of candy is staggering.  I sat at the table for the a cappella group.  The Alliance for Independent Feminists was on our left; the Student Animal Legal Defense Fund (see: "Sexual Politics of Meat Slide Show" from Monday) was on our right.  They each got more than double the number of signups we did.  "Do you sing, are you a feminist, or are you a vegan?"  "I'm all three."  "Oh boy."  I think the Alliance for Independent Feminists got as many men to sign up as they did women.  They're going to be part of a grassroots movement to transform the group into the Alliance for Dependent Feminists.  The Vegans got lots of sign ups because they were giving out homemade chocolate chip cookies.  There's no meat in chocolate chip cookies.  Ten Organizations That Don't Exist Here:  1. Society to Reduce Grade Inflation 2. Law and Infectious Diseases Club 3. Alliance of Lazy People 4. International Appreciation and Acceptance Club 5. Organization to Promote Compromise 6. Math Team 7. The People Who Don't Want Corporate Jobs Club 8. Low LSAT Score Society 9. Menial Labor Club 10. Society for Future Housewives

      I've updated the previous post with the answer.  The real event announcement is for the "Sexual Politics of Meat" slide show.  Really.  If anyone who reads this goes, report back to me.  I'd go, but I have somewhere else I need to be.  It would be ironic if I could say something like "I'd go, but I have a dinner appointment at the Outback Steakhouse."  But that would be a lie.  Oh well.  The 1Ls are the Journals Fair right now.  We have a gazillion journals here (I think around 10, but I'm not totally sure), all open to 1Ls (all excluding the Harvard Law Review, that is -- but I'm not talking about them here because they don't recruit at the journals fair and they're a totally separate entity), and all pretty much the same.  The big differences are size -- the smaller ones promote people up the ranks faster out of necessity, so you generally get to do more more quickly, and I've also found you get to know more people at the smaller ones because meetings are more intimate and you're always seeing the same people -- and obviously subject matter.  And once you're article editing, interest in the subject matter does matter a little, but really not even all that much, and at the lower ranks, checking footnotes, subject doesn't really seem to matter at all.  I worked on a big journal and a small journal last year, and, if my last paragraph didn't give it away, I liked the smaller one better.  Less bureaucracy, got to meet more people, had a more rewarding experience.  The bigger one gave me a lot more free food though.  And really the differences were mostly at the margin and neither was a tremendously different experience from the other.  And from what I've heard from friends, they're all really pretty much the same.   That said, if you're choosing a journal -- anywhere, not just here -- I'd say to choose it based on the people you meet.  If you like them and feel like you want to hang out with them and work with them and get to know them, that's probably going to be a fine choice.  If you don't seem to click, even if you like the subject better, it'll just be less fun. And so little of the work you'll do is subject-specific that it probably won't make up for the people difference.  And, just to undercut the actual advice in this post, I'll finish with something trying to be funny.  I mentioned "rising up the ranks" in the journal.  That may not have been clear.  So here are the twenty ranks of journal work positions:  1. Guy who checks to make sure the commas are all the same length in all of the footnotes. 2. Girl who laminates the bluebook covers so they don't get torn. 3. Guy who keeps track of when the library books are due and sends out a reminder e-mail when it's getting close. 4. Girl who makes sure all of the red pens have ink. 5. Guy who counts the words in the article by hand and divides by 250 to determine the rough estimate page count. 6. Girl who collects the call numbers for all of the sources from the library catalog. 7. Guy who photocopies the sheet with the call numbers. 8. Vice President of Bluebook Rule 5. 9. Vice President of Bluebook Rule 7. 10. Girl who runs the elections for the Bluebook Vice President positions. 11. Guy who buys mini Kit Kat bars for the footnote-checking sessions in the library. 12. Girl who reserves the tables in the library for the footnote-checking sessions. 13. Guy who checks the footnotes for proper form. 14. Girl who checks the work of the guy who checks the footnotes for proper form. 15. Guy who checks the work of the girl who checks the work of the guy who checks the footnotes for proper form. 16. Girl who calls the author to tell him someone from the journal will be calling him soon to talk about the article. 17. Guy who calls the girl who calls the author to find out if she spoke to him or just left a message. 18. Girl who makes a list of everyone else's jobs. 19. Guy who rewrites the girl's list because he has nothing else to do. 20. Editor-In-Chief

      Here's a game for you.  One of these announcements is real.  Two are fake.  I swear one of these is real.  I am not playing a trick on you.  #1:  HLS Squash Club  Do you eat squash or want to learn?  The cafeteria has seven kinds of squash ready to eat, perfect during the long, cold winter.  The HLS Squash Club provides an informal group of people who love squash, and we gather monthly to eat it.  There are no dues, meetings, or squash-eating experience requirements.  Eaters of all ability levels are welcomed.    #2:  Sexual Politics of Meat Slide Show Sponsored by Student Animal Legal Defense Fund (SALDF)  What do sexism, racism, homophobia, and speciesism have to do with each other? Everything! Don't miss Carol J. Adams's amazing slide show that, among other things, documents how our culture sexualizes animals and animalizes women in order to facilitate our consumption of them both.   #3:  Twister Conference Kick-Off Meeting Sponsored by Harvard Twister Society   The Twister Conference is a two-day event held every February that is the largest Twister event in North America and  attracts more than 1,000 attendees every year.  Perks of participation include exposure to the latest versions of Twister (including the new glow-in-the-dark board with its own built-in smoke machine, contact with the heads of the Twister Corporation, and a chance to meet people from the business school with a similar interest in Twister. Dinner  will be served.   UPDATE: The real one is #2.  Seriously.

      Anything I read is in danger of being taken out of context when it's getting close to midnight and I haven't written anything all day.   urlLink Waddling Thunder  writes:  "Law school, as we all knew when we came here, is a credentializing system. I'm here to learn, obviously. I actually enjoy almost all the studying. But the whole point is to become a lawyer with a job at the end. In return for HLS's near guarantee of this result, I'm paying a huge sum and staying here for three years."  I'm focusing on the first sentence mostly.  Yes, we're here for a degree.  Yes, it's lovely that lots of law firms come here to hire people.  But the attitude that this is a "credentializing system" in some greater way than undergrad is a "credentializing system" for a job that requires a college degree, or in some greater way than an entry-level job is a "credentializing system" for something better, doesn't necessarily seem justified to me.  We do learn things here -- how to think about our legal system and government and justice and the rule of law and all sorts of interesting and valuable stuff.  We meet bright and talented people who sometimes enlighten us or enrich our lives.  We read some cool stuff.  We gain tools for thinking about societal problems and how they could be addressed.  You can't get a job as a lawyer without a law degree, no.  But to say that being able to get a job as a lawyer is the only thing these three years provide (and that's not what Waddling Thunder is saying -- I'm just attacking that idea, which, with the rest of the quote, is fine -- but I have a larger point I want to make) is selling this place short.  But I do think that a lot of people have this idea -- that we're wasting our time and can't they just give us the degree already.  And it's an idea that spoils the experience, I think.  The Dean, last week at her "State of the Law School" speech, said:  "The single worst thing about this school is the detachment of many of its students.  I am not saying in any way that you are to blame for this school's problems. We in the faculty and administration have done things to create this attitude, and those things should stop. But the solution lies partly in your hands. This won't be the institution it can be until we all take responsibility."  (by the way -- thanks to new 1L reporter Adina Levine at  urlLink The Record  for choosing this as one of the quotes to pull for her article on the Dean's speech -- quite a nice job on her first Record assignment, actually -- so I didn't have to watch the whole webcast to find it)  Can't think of much that could make someone feel more detached than if they treated this like a stopover on the way to a credential, here to get "stamped and certified" and off they go a "real experience" at a law firm.  Which really is just a "credentializing system" for a job in government, or as an in-house counsel, or any number of other things.  All of which are just "credentializing systems" for respectable cocktail party conversation and a nice retirement.  It's three years of our lives.  I'd rather not minimize it into a waste of time waiting for the degree.  There's value to the education; there's value in thinking about the stuff our classes make us think about; there's value in being around our fellow students; there's value in the experience itself, for the sake of the experience.  If there wasn't, it'd be pointless to be here.  Just my instant reaction to the comment.  Maybe I'm wrong.

      "So I have these interviews coming up, and I really want to look like I know something about these law firms.  What do you suggest I do?"  Thanks for asking.  Here's five valuable law firm research techniques, as outlined in the bestselling self-help career guide for the legal industry, "What Color Is Your Paralegal?  Uh, I mean Parachute." You might also think of this as chapter 4 of my upcoming imaginary book, "How to Get a Job at a Law Firm if You Are a Character on a Sitcom."  Tip #1.  Go to the office of the firm you want to work for, hit the security guard over the head with a large salami, shove him into a supply closet, steal his badge, and switch clothes with him.  Then you'll be able to enter the building and do lots of in-person research.  I don't know exactly what you'd be looking for, since the office probably looks like any other office, and what exactly will you find out about the firm by looking at the art on the walls.  But still, it's worth the effort.  Tip #2.  Call the law firm pretending to be a reporter from the New York Times doing a story on what law students need to say in their interviews in order to get a job at your firm.  Of course, this will yield fantastic results, because every firm wants to tell a reporter its secrets.  Using the name "Jayson Blair" may help you get them to talk.  Using Jayson Blair to write your story may lead to some misinformation, however.  Tip #3.  Hang out right outside the firm's office, and casually "bump" into the hiring partner while he's carrying a cup of coffee.  Apologize profusely and insist he let you buy him another cup of coffee.  This guaranteed-to-work scheme will get you a first interview with the hiring partner and allow you an opportunity to impress!  Except for the fact you spilled his coffee all over his $3000 suit.  Oops.  Tip #4.  Send your beautiful foreign cousin to interview for a job as receptionist.  Then, once she gets hired, have her tape all of the phone calls and let you listen.  You'll know everything the company's doing.  And you'll be committing a felony.  A perfect start to any legal career.  Tip #5.  Feign disinterest.  There's nothing an employer likes more than the chase.  Pretend you've never heard of them.  Play hard-to-get.  They'll be eating out of the palm of your hand.  Never mind that they have hundreds of other students to choose from, all of whom know the details of their dental insurance plan.  You'll be more intriguing, more of a challenge -- and you'll get the job every time.  Or not.

      I've never read David Greising's business column in the Chicago Tribune, but I just came across a  urlLink surprisingly-compelling article  about how it's been phased out of the paper.  It's an article about columnists in general, and whether a small but loyal readership -- and an undeniable quality -- should be enough to sustain something even when the general readership ignores it.  I admit there's a slight bias on my part toward thinking that a small but loyal readership is a nice readership to have, and the mere existence of this weblog may be the only reason I think the article is interesting.  Nevertheless, I found it interesting.  Especially:  "Greising may not have had a mass readership, but I find it hard to believe he didnt have a core of readers who looked for him every day. I know several people who read him who had hardly ever glanced at the business section before Greising was there; and, indeed, many of those folks read Greising but ignored the business sections uninspiring offerings. While my market research methods may not be as sophisticated as the Tribunes, I wonder if they are more journalistically sound. There ought to be a place in newspapering for gut judgments, for recognizing quality and sticking with it, for finding a way to convince readers that you have a star on your hands. Maybe that kind of effort is reserved for the likes of Ask Amy.  And what if Greising had a small but loyal core readership? Isnt that worth something? After all, not everything in a newspaper has to appeal to everyone. Put a little something for everyone in there and pretty soon youve stitched together a readership."

      From  urlLink The Smoking Gun  [link fixed from before], a law student at Tulane has written up a "request for interview" contract he's sending to firms.  It's quite amusing.  Check out especially points 8 and 9:  "8. I am utterly unconcerned with having any sort of personal life outside the office.... If my mother's funeral was the day of a key deposition, I would do the eulogy via teleconference after the deposition.  If my wedding was on the date of a key trial, the wedding would be postponed...."  "9. If a piece of evidence was accidentally dropped into the garbage, I would have no problem going to the local dump and spending days covered knee-deep in the worst foul-smelling sludge imaginable to search for the evidence."  If this guy gets a job out of this, and he probably will, there's something wrong with the world.

      Here's an short exercise in stupidity.  The Record printed a story this week about Danny Glover speaking at the law school.  You can find the article  urlLink here .  The first sentence of the story reads as follows, except the words in bold are my own additions, not in the actual article:  "Wherever there's been some law, some change in attitude, lawyers have been at the forefront of that, defining individual liberties, defining people's rights... and defining people's right to live in peace," declared  movie actor and star of "Angels in the Outfield"  Danny Glover to a captivated audience on September 10 at this academic year's first Saturday School Event.  Later in the article:  "I'm glad to pay taxes," Glover , who has a heck of a lot of money, and probably doesn't notice the difference,  declared as he explained his belief that taxes provide for "those who are incapable of providing for themselves."

      As promised, my review of Professor Warren's "The Two Income Trap" is  urlLink here .  The next book I review, I'll try to pick one I'm going to hate, because that will be more entertaining to write.  This one was fun to read and fun to write, but I didn't get to use the word "horrific," which is a great word.  Also, you can read a shorter version of my typical first day of class speech (condensed from the longer version posted here last week) over  urlLink here  with the wrong photo on the page.  The photo in the paper is of bored and sleepy students.  The photo on the web page is of the law school dean speaking, and so the caption, "Mr. Smith, is my interminable speech about the attendance policy keeping you awake?" doesn't quite fit.  But you can check it out anyway if you like.

      I just got back from Career Services' "Looks Can Kill" tips session on dressing for interviews.  At the end, there were free botox injections and breast implants.  No, just coupons.  But seriously, if the color of my belt buckle, or the type of collar on my dress shirt is really making the difference, I have bigger problems to worry about.  I expected to either be the only person at this presentation, or to be sitting among people not normally let out during daylight hours -- but it was actually pretty crowded, with some people having totally legitimate questions about what kinds of shirts or shoes or whatever, and some people just there because they thought it would be entertainingly ridiculous.  They got their wish.    I took notes, so I wouldn't forget anything.  I actually left about ten minutes before the end, though -- I was having a bit of difficulty keeping a straight face (as were many people), and when the "internationally certified image consultant" (who exactly certifies these people is unclear) said that men should remember "to stand straight, but not too erect," I really did think I was going to lose it.  The presenter started with an analogy -- when we see bruised tomatoes in the supermarket, we don't buy them because we think they won't taste good.  And firms won't hire us, therefore, if we don't look good, because they'll think we won't work good.  Or something like that.  Lesson from that analogy: cover your bruises.  She advised us to incorporate our "inner selves" into our images.  That's why I'm planning on using my intestines as a necklace.  She told us about a friend of hers who was never getting any promotions because she wore clothes that were too tight and skirts too short.  This was "inappropriate for where she worked."  She worked at a brothel.  She advised doing "research" -- going to a firm's offices beforehand and spying on what people are wearing.  This seems totally absurd.  She said that women and men respond differently to dress: women do not want other women to "outdress" them, and men do not want women to wear any clothes at all.  She advised buying the most expensive suit you can afford, because "if you crumple a $3000 suit, it does not stay crumpled."  In addition, if you light a $3000 suit on fire, it does not burn; if you spread peanut butter on a $3000 suit it does not stick; and if you try and pay your rent with a $3000 suit, you will soon be homeless.  But your suit won't be crumpled.  "Shop with a list," she advised.  "Socks, pantyhose, applesauce, cereal, cufflinks, onions, dress shoes."  And "try before you buy."  Just because you're a size 10 shoe does not mean you're a size 10 shirt, or a size 10 suit.  Just because you take a 54 extra fat from one brand, doesn't mean you're not a petite extra small in another.  Buy things too big, not too small -- "clothes can be taken it, but not taken out."  Insightful.  Shop with another person... and that other person's credit card.  Do not believe salespeople.  Look in the mirror.  Wear a neutral color (clear?).  A lightweight fabric -- "wool is good for all four seasons, except when it's hot."  Oh, you mean summer.  And you should make sure the clothing fits "correctly."  Thanks.  Make sure buttons are sewn on properly.  Do not pull the strings or your suit may fall apart.  A $3000 suit will, however, put itself back together again.  If your pants fall apart, do not staple them closed.  Shoes shouldn't be more than 3 inches tall.  Ties shouldn't be more than 3 inches long.  Socks shouldn't be more than 3 inches thick.  You should have two shoes, no more, and no less.  Shoes need to breathe.  High heels are risky if there are cobblestones in the office lobby.  Keep jewelry simple.  For men, a set of pearls.  For women, a neatly trimmed beard. How would she describe interview clothes?  "Like being out on a date... going to church."  But Catholic priests should avoid wearing the beanies and sailor suits that this might imply.  If the pockets are sewn up so it seems like you can't open them, don't open them.  "Suits without pockets are more formal; but if you already have a suit that has pockets, don't worry, you don't need to remove them."  That was the first time I couldn't stop laughing.  "Your jacket should definitely have armholes."  That was the second.  "Single-breasted versus double-breasted is especially an issue for some women."  That, childishly enough, was the third.  "Don't wear clothes that make you look like an alien." "Women have more choices than men as far as zippers."  They can be open, or closed, depending on the message you want to send.  Go shopping with the shoes you will eventually be wearing.  They make great companions.  If you have a three-button suit, button the top two.  Unless the top button is located under the lapel, in which case only button the middle one.  Unless there are vents in the back.  In which case button the bottom one.  Unless the buttons don't align properly.  In which case buy a new suit.   In terms of color: you want to match your own degree of contrast.  If you have dark hair and light skin, wear a light shirt and a dark tie.  If you have dark hair and dark skin, wear a light shirt and a light tie.  If you have light hair and light skin, wear a dark shirt and a dark tie.  If you are Michael Jackson, wear a bag over your head.  If you are Monica Lewinsky, don't wear a blue dress.  Men shouldn't wear makeup.  Collars should only be worn with shirts and not alone.  The soles of your shoes should not have holes.  The souls of your shoes should be pure.  No neon colors.  Red, white, and blue combinations may send the wrong message.  Especially if you're interviewing with an overseas firm.  "And, finally, I want to talk about non-verbal communication."  I didn't think there was much to say about that.  Maybe in sign language?  Grooming: "hair should be neat.  Women, you can wear your hair down -- as long as it's clean."  She really did say that.  I'm all set now that I've been through this vital training.  I know that I need two shoes, not just one, and I should polish them to a shine and wear them on my hands.  And wrap a tie around my neck, zip up my fly, and buy some polyester socks.  I can't wait for the interviews.

      Thanks to  urlLink How Appealing  for the link this afternoon.  Appreciated.  Welcome to any new readers finding me from over there.  This afternoon, the law school dean gave a "State of The Law School" address, followed by a party at a hotel reception hall.  Given that the party was alreday scheduled, it was safe to assume the state of the law school would be good.  Or else the party would be an awfully glum affair.  "The state of the law school is bad.  We'll be getting rid of most of you tomorrow.  Come to the party."  She said good things are in store for the distant future when we'll no longer be there -- more technology infrastructure, new buildings, nicer facilities... for the law students to come, after we leave.  For us, free coffee and some more weights in the gym.  I don't mean to minimize those two developments.  It's interesting to think about this stuff -- this is why institutions need deans, and people in charge with the long-term in mind.  The people there now will never see the benefits of what's to come; and so we need to just accept that, and in some ways act as advocates for the students of the future... if we think these are good changes, it's almost our obligation to support them even though we'll never reap the benefits.  It's why it's so hard to make grand changes in extracurricular organizations in college or here -- because the students turn over every year, and no one's there for more than a little while, there's no one looking out for the long term, and no one there to guide the ship and put it on a course.  Everything's year-to-year -- and some things just can't be done in a year.  The law school newspaper changes layouts every year; the a cappella group changes repertoire.  These are the easy things.  Big things -- developing a loyal audience, creating some infrastructure and plans for growth -- take time an energy that transitory bodies can't focus on.  There's no steward in charge, like a dean.  I don't know what my point is.  Her speech was really good.  I'm excited to be part of the community here.  The party was okay.  I'll link to the story in tomorrow's Record when it comes out.

      Apologies for not more words yesterday.  I'll make up for it this morning, as I await my constitutional law class at 10:40.  The a cappella singing group I'm in here at law school had a small (very small) concert yesterday evening, with special guest group The Alternotives from Oxford.  They were quite good.  We split the Oxford singers among a few of us to host them for the night, which was a lot of fun.  One thing they wanted to know about America:  *Is American high school really like "Saved By The Bell?"  My high school wasn't; I don't know about other people's.  Yesterday, in the aforementioned constitutional law class, the professor told us that after talking to some of his colleagues, he thinks it might be a good idea to put a ten-minute break somewhere in the middle of our 100-minute class.  Many people clapped.  Then he said that to do so, he'd like to start class ten minutes earlier, at 10:30 instead of 10:40.  People began to murmur.  He told anyone who had a class conflict to raise his or her hand.  No one did.  But then someone asked if we could vote on it.  Starting class ten minutes earlier: very few votes; no break: a lot of votes.  How could something that provoked spontaneous applause just seconds earlier be voted down by an overwhelming percentage?  It's not like 10:30 is particularly early in the morning, or substantially earlier than 10:40... but people like their sleep.  It's kind of silly.  Speaking of classroom votes, in another class, the professor had us vote on how we'd better like our extra-credit (she provides the possibility of "extra-credit" if you miss no more than 3 classes and show up each time having done the problem set to be discussed in that class -- it's a legal problem-based class, which is actually a really cool approach and makes the class sessions really interested, because we're discussing actual situations and not just hearing a professor lecture on what we just read -- because the problem sets make this class more work than most classes, with just reading) -- the choices were:  Choice A: Of the people eligible for extra credit,  Anyone who falls in the top 1/2 of the distribution of the B-minus grades gets bumped to a B, top 1/2 of the B gets bumped up to a B-plus, top 1/2 of the B-plus gets bumped up to an A-minus, and top 1/2 of the A-minus gets bumped up to an A.  Choice B: Of the people eligible for extra credit,  All of the B-minus grades get bumped up to a B, all of the B grades get bumped up to a B-plus, top 1/2 of the distribution of B-plus grades get bumped up to an A-minus, and top 1/4 of the A-minus grades get bumped up to an A.  So basically you trade, in Choice B, a greater chance to go from A-minus to A for a guarantee that if you're eligible for the extra credit, you won't get a B-minus, and if you would've gotten a B you're sure to get a B-plus.  I liked that trade-off (the "risk averse" choice) and went with choice B.  Choice B won, in a very narrow 54-48 vote.  To me, the jump from A-minus to A provides quite a bit less utility than the B-minus to B or B to B-plus jumps, so I didn't think it was much of a dilemma. But apparently 48 people are more confident than I am.

      I don't look at my counter stats often enough.  Three of the google searches that found their way to this site just in the last few days:  "stress balls" "mama leone's restaurant" [I believe that's from a song parody a while back...] "video of my wife"   Whoever you are, I don't have video of your wife.

      Career Services event for this Thursday.  I'm posting the description without comment.  LOOKS CAN KILL -- Tips on Dress and Appearance for Interviewing. It takes less than a minute for an interviewer to form an impression of  you.  "Dressing the part" is critical.  Learn where to shop, how to figure  out which styles look good on you, what to do with your hair, what color  tie to wear, and other tips to help you exude confidence and  professionalism.  We will be joined by a Boston area professional image  consultant who has worked with law students and lawyers.  OK -- I can't resist one small comment.  "What color tie to wear?"  If my job is hinging on what color my tie is....

      Seven things no one ever says on the way out of class:  1. "I'm so upset I didn't get called on!" 2. "Good thing I didn't do the reading!" 3. "Wow, those three hours just flew by!" 4. "I wish I had a tape of that lecture, because I'd love to listen to it again, in its entirety!" 5. "If only the professor was less animated when he talked!" 6. "Man, it sucks that it's Friday and no more class until Monday!" 7. "The only thing that would make this class worse is if they gave out free food!"

      I may have told this story before, but I was reminded of it when looking a little while ago at a 30-year-old Harvard Law yearbook.  There's a professor emeritus here with the last name Oldman.  This guy is really, really old.  His last name is Old Man.  I think that's funny.

      I heard a great story from a friend yesterday.  She got an e-mail in her hotmail account, which she never gives out but is just [her name]@hotmail, from a lawyer at a firm she's bidding for, inviting her out to lunch.  She was baffled by this.  So she e-mailed back and said she thought the e-mail may have been sent to her by mistake, but that she is interested in the firm and bid to interview.  The lawyer responds and says it was a mistake -- there's another 2L with the same name as she's got, at another law school, and the e-mail was meant for her... but that my friend ought to send her resume along anyway.  Cool story, right?

      Just a stab in the dark here: if you're a Harvard 1L and have any interest in writing a biweekly or monthly column in The Record about your experiences, send me an e-mail for more info.  This is my attempt to recruit.  They're looking; I said I'd help.  If you're a Harvard 1L without any interesting in writing a column for The Record but read this anyway, I'd also be delighted if you e-mailed just to say hi.  But you don't have to.  I'll never know.  I am pretty nice about sharing my old outlines though.  (This is what happens when I go six hours without any new e-mails... I think I'm just bored.)

      I was on the subway (oops, the metro... no, I mean the T) today and I saw an ad for some vegetarian organization.  The ad said "call us to order a vegetarian starter kit."  Uh, do they mean seeds?  This could be a great late-night informercial or some cool catalog copy... vegetarian starter kit, only $19.95... and all you get are some tomato seeds.  Ha.  Maybe I'll call just to see.

      Dear Harvard Law School 2L,  This personalized note that you and your classmates are all receiving is to let you know about a law firm that's "different" from all the rest.  We'll be coming to campus to interview and host an informative reception (read: free food) in just a few weeks, and before we do, we wanted to send you some junk mail.  While you may not be considering any firms in Des Moines, we think our firm is "different" enough that you'll change your mind.  Unlike the other firms likely to be on your lists, we *do not act within the boundaries of the law.*  At our firm, the law isn't a rule, it's a recommendation.  We do whatever we can to help our clients  regardless of whether or not any of the three branches of government have sanctioned that act.   That means we supply free lunches  and dinners  for our associates each night, stolen from area restaurants.  It means there are occasionally dead bodies in the bathroom.  It means you don't pay taxes on your earnings -- and you're paid in cash.  And it means your billable hour requirements bear no resemblance to the amount of time you actually work.  In fact, we're the only Vault-ranked law firm that supplies our associates with handguns -- after just one year!  Plus, our dress code is not only business casual, but we provide the mask!  And a free car.  With lasers.  Come and visit with us, either at our reception next month or at any one of the seventeen federal prisons around the country our partners are currently housed in.  We hope to meet you soon!

      Passed by a housing complex today named "River Court" and it gave me an idea for some fun law school housing: what about a set of dorms, each named after a Supreme Court justice, so you'd have Warren Court, and Burger Court, and Rehnquist Court... I think that would be cute...

      "The Standard First Day of Class Speech," Take 2  I posted something a few days ago called "The Standard First Day of Class Speech."  I've done a rewrite.  So some of this will look familiar; it's not that I've forgotten I posted it, or anything like that.  "The First Day of Class"  I'm Professor Lawreviewandsupremecourtclerkship, and this is Space Law.  Welcome.  If you're not signed up for this course, see me after class and I'll put your name on a sheet of paper I will intend to bring to the registrar, but instead will accidentally drop down the sewer grate, forget all about it, and you won't know anything until the end of the semester when you don't get a grade for the class and it's too late to do anything about it.  If you're on the wait list, keep waiting.  If your schedule doesn't say Space Law, and you're expecting a different class, you may be in the wrong room, here at the wrong time, or a combination of the two.  I really can't be sure.  What I want to do this morning is get all of the procedural stuff out of the way, talk about how the class will operate and what you can expect.  Then I want to jump right into the first assignment, which I'm sure you've all read even though the bookstore hasn't ordered the casebooks yet.  As far as seating goes, I notice you've filled the room starting from the back, meaning that there's not a seat free in the back two rows, yet the first seven rows have just two people in them.  One is the guy who came in late; the other is the guy who came in first.  If I had a backbone, I'd tell everyone to move down and fill the bottom few rows; instead, I'll just act like I don't notice, and wander aimlessly around the room while I teach, up the aisle, down the aisle, trying to find a spot where you can all actually see me, I can hear you when you speak, and I don't look like I'm just teaching to the two people up front.  I'll expect everyone to be prepared for every class.  To that end, I will assign a panel each day who will be the only ones called on, and the only ones for whom I will actually know if you did the reading.  This will help me ensure that everyone does the reading.  At least once during the semester.  I'll assign you to panels based on whether or not you volunteer; people who do not volunteer will very likely find themselves not on a panel.  This will not affect your grade.  There are some topics that are particularly dense, that I'll just have to speed through at a pace unlikely to make any of you learn them.  This will accomplish nothing, but I'll talk for an hour about them anyway.  Other topics are less doctrinal and more public policy-oriented. For those, I'll bring in my new mp3 player and open up the floor for discussion while I check out the new John Mayer album. Since you won't be graded on your class participation, and, heck, hardly even on your final exams, there's no real need for me to listen to anything you have to say anyway. There are a few topics that are so dismal that I will cancel class at the last minute and expect you to learn them on your own. I may test on them.  It depends on whether or not the professor I steal the test from tested on them.  Attendance in class is mandatory unless you're not here, in which case it's optional.  Please don't e-mail me regarding an expected absence from class.  I have no reason to care.  The final exam will be hard, and hardly read.  Your grade will be based exclusively on the ratio of consonants to vowels in your last name.  A few times during the semester, I will print out a new syllabus that is identical to the old one, but I will insist there's something different about it.  On the occasions that I do make a change in the syllabus, I will not tell you and will not print out any copies for you.  Occasionally I will provide handouts in class. For these, I will make approximately three-quarters of the number of copies I need, and usually touch them while they're still hot so the ink smears.  I plan on using the overhead projector a bit, but I will make sure not to plug it in so that I can spend 20 minutes at the beginning of class futzing around with it. On the rare occasion I have a video to show, there is no reason to expect I will actually get it to play, and even if I can there's no possible chance it'll be the right video.  More likely than not, it will be a video of my wife and me in a compromising position.  In the alternative, it may be a video of me and one of your classmates in a similar position.  The casebook for the class is "Space Law." I wrote it three years ago and it's now in its fifteenth edition. Every three weeks, a new edition will come out and you will have to buy a new copy.  This is required.  I'll be assigning random pages throughout it during the course of the semester, usually corresponding to nothing in particular and occasionally pages that haven't yet been written. Version 8 of the syllabus, which you should all have, goes into more detail.  There is a paper requirement for the course that I will not enforce.  There will also be a five-minute break in the middle of class whenever I'm bored and want to run back to my office and take another anti-depressant before continuing.  There's a sign-up sheet outside my office for anyone who wants to go to lunch with me.  I can't imagine why you would.  I'm available for third-year paper advising.  My wife just left me.  See you tomorrow.

      This week's Adviser, the newsletter we get to tell us all of the administrative stuff we may or may not need to know -- what the exam deferment policy is, which professors need research assistants, and how to obtain a telemarketing position in the law school's fundraising office, for example this week -- has the following listing:  6:45 PM  PON Film Series  I have yet to figure out what PON can possibly mean.  I need a glossary.  Moving on to some self-indulgent links:   urlLink My latest column  from the Sept. 11th Harvard Law Record, about casebooks, interviews, and Warren Christopher.   urlLink Last week's column  from the Record's career guide, which I posted the text of last week, but not the link, about the job search and dress socks.  And an article I wrote in last week's Career Guide about students who stayed in Boston for the summer,  urlLink Boston: Why Leave?   And some non-self-indulgent links:  One of my classmates has a  urlLink really interesting column  in this week's paper about his summer in Africa.  My awesome bankruptcy professor has a new book out called "The Two Income Trap: Why Middle Class Mothers and Fathers are Going Broke."  It's a wonderful book, and I'll have a review of it up at some point soon (just read it yesterday), and you can listen to her talking about it on  urlLink NPR , or you can watch a video of her talking about it on the  urlLink CBS Early Show  (where there's also an excerpt).  You could also   urlLink buy the book , if you're so inclined.

      I feel like I should write something about September 11th And how being a law student makes you realize how powerful the rule of law is And how scary it is to live in a place without the rule of law And how September 11th made it feel, for a while, That we weren't under the rule of law anymore And that was scary  Until I sat down and thought about this I hadn't really made any kind of connection Between being a law student and what happened on September 11th And the rule of law stuff just sounded intelligent  But I wasn't sure I really knew what it meant I just knew that it was scary Because who knew what had happened And what might happen next  But what law school really does make me think about sometimes Is all of the bad things that can happen but don't We could have people defying court orders Rioting, looting Overpowering the police and militia If we lost faith in the security of our currency People would just steal stuff If we lost faith in our government And didn't trust the coercive police power of the state There would be anarchy Bad things would happen The future would be uncertain And as I thought about this, I realized This is what living under the rule of law means  We're fortunate to live in a country Where most of the time, bad stuff isn't happening And when it does, there are ways we deal with it Bad people do go to jail Good people generally don't Our Presidents, no matter their parties, listen to the courts Leave office when they lose elections Don't turn the military against its own citizens  We're fortunate that there's transparency TV, radio, newspapers, Internet That will tell us if bad stuff starts happening And won't permit secret government plots  To undermine the rule of law Most of the time  When I think about September 11th I think about what it must be like every day in places less secure And it's frightening To think that instead of worrying about mundane things Like whether you're out of toothpaste You need to worry about whether you can leave your house Without something bad happening Or whether something bad will happen Even if you stay home  September 11th was scary But without the rule of law September 12th would have been scarier  And I really don't know why I've written this as a free verse poem

      Law firm receptions are the law student equivalent of "meal replacement bars."  Each day this week, there's a law firm on campus, hosting a reception at a Harvard Square restaurant or other food-providing venue, letting students meet with attorneys, and learn more about the firm as we complete our bidding process where we decide which firms to interview with.  It's interesting the way the scale balances -- right now, the firms need us to choose them.  They want as many Harvard students as they can get to be interested in them, and want to interview with them.  So they host nice receptions, and give out nice food, and pens, and frisbees, and highlighters.  Then, once we've chosen them, they interview us and the ball is back in their court.  From perhaps 48 interviews, a firm might call back 8 students.  Obviously this ratio is lower or higher for different firms, but there really aren't any who call back more than half -- and for some, it's a ratio like 99 interviews and 2 callbacks.  So they get to be choosy, and we're the ones hoping to be chosen.  Then, once everyone finishes interviewing, the ball is back in our court as we (hopefully) have more than one offer, but can only pick one firm to go to.  So the leverage switches back.  Finally, when we go work there next summer, we're trying to impress them enough that we get a full-time offer. So, once again, we feel the heat, not them.  So it's an interesting process, at least from that perspective.  What I've found the receptions aren't bad for is trying out things to say in interviews -- what's the reaction like from the lawyers if I talk about this experience, or that experience... not really -- I mean, I don't talk all that much at these things; I'll talk if approached, but I'm uncomfortable really seeking people out and forcing my way into the conversation... but when I do talk, I find it's not as uncomfortable as I might have feared.  I can talk reasonably intelligently about law school stuff.  I guess.  Anyway, the food was great at yesterday's -- it was at Finale, a dessert place -- they had a really, really good spread.  Cheesecake, Fruit Tarts, miniature quiche -- not the usual crab cakes and egg rolls.  Finale wins points.  And, I suppose, the firm wins points for choosing to host it there...

      I was in the law school cafeteria getting something to eat, and the guy serving the food made polite small talk:  HIM: How's your day going? ME: Pretty good.  How about you.  [Okay, just polite stuff.  Figured he'd say "good," give me my food, and I could be on my way.]  HIM: Not so good.  Stomach hurts a bit. ME: Hope not from the food.  [I gestured to the food he was serving me.  I thought I was being pretty clever there.]  HIM: Yeah, maybe.  [What??]  HIM: You know how the chef has to taste everything he cooks.  Sometimes when it's not quite cooked.  I think maybe that happened.  [What??]  HIM: So, yeah, my stomach's bothering me a bit.  Here's your food.  [What??]  He should watch out.  This is law school, after all.  If I get sick from the food, that conversation alone is probably enough for a decent settlement.  Wow.

      The standard first day of class speech:  [I've done a rewrite of this, that's about four days North on the weblog.  So if you've been linked to here, just scroll up and you'll find it.  And if you're just reading down from the top, you can pretty safely scroll past without missing anything.  I'll keep it up rather than deleting it, for no reason I can articulate but just because.]  I'm professor Fringledingle, and this is Space Law.  If you're not signed up for this class, see me after class and I'll put your name on a sheet of paper I will intend to bring to the registrar, but instead I will accidentally drop it down the sewer grate, forget all about it, and you won't know anything until the end of the semester when you don't get a grade for the class and it's too late to do anything about it.  If your schedule doesn't say Space Law, and you're expecting a different class, you may be in the wrong room, here at the wrong time, or a combination of the two.  What I want to do this morning is first get all of the procedural stuff out of the way, talk about how the class will operate and a few other notes.  Then I want to give a very brief introduction to Space Law.  And then I want to jump right into the first assignment, which I'm sure you've all read even though the bookstore hasn't ordered the casebooks yet.    First, procedural stuff.  This class meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9 in the morning until 10:30, here in Loch Ness Hall, room 74.  I expect you all to be here on time, ready to learn; I will be here on time, ready to teach.  Sometimes I'll do a lot of lecturing, sometimes I'll call on students, sometimes I'll sleep through my alarm -- it depends on the topic we're up to.  There are some topics that are particularly dense that I'll just have to speed through at a pace unlikely to make any of you learn it, or really accomplish much at all.  Other topics are less doctrinal and more public policy-oriented.  For those, I'll bring in my new mp3 player and open up the floor for discussion while I check out the new John Mayer album.  Since you won't be graded on your class participation, there's no real need for me to listen to anything you have to say anyway.  There are a few topics that are so dismal that I will cancel class at the last minute and expect you to learn them on your own.  I may test on them -- since it's not like I have to actually write out answers to my own test questions -- but, because the material sucks so bad, I won't actually talk about them.  Attendance is absolutely mandatory, but don't bother sending me an e-mail or calling my office if you're not going to be here.  I don't care why you're not here, I don't really care if you are here, and I won't take attendance.  It just makes me feel bad to see empty seats.  The final exam will be hard, and hardly read.  Your grade will be based on whether or not saying your name makes me feel happy or sad, usually just based on the combination of letters.  Hard "K" sounds happen to make me happy.  Soft "C" sounds do not.  Take that as you will.  A few times during the semester, I will print out a new syllabus that is identical to the old one, but I will insist there's something different about it.  Ignore my ramblings.  I will also occasionally provide handouts, that I will make about three-quarters of the copies I need and usually touch them when they're still hot so the ink smears.  I plan on using the overhead projector a bit, but I will make sure not to plug it in so that I can spend 20 minutes at the beginning of class futzing around with it.  On the rare occasion I have a video to show, there is no reason to expect I will actually get it to play, and even if I can there's really no way it'll be the right video.  I think that's enough on procedure.  Let's move to an overview of Space Law.  Space Law is one of the most interesting and rapidly-changing areas of the law, and is where I've chosen to focus all of my research over the past three decades.  It used to be this that law school didn't have a course in Space Law.  Then I wrote a casebook, and all of a sudden, whoda thunk it?  Space Law is largely common law, derived from the federal government, from states, and from local precedent.  I'm going to say the word jurisdiction just so you have it in your notes.  Buttermilk is also a fun word for your notes.  And Plinko.  Plinko's a fun word to say.  The casebook for the class is "Space Law."  I wrote it.  It's now in its fifteenth edition.  I'll be assigning random pages throughout it, usually corresponding to nothing in particular.  Version 8 of the syllabus, which you should all have, goes into more detail.  And now, let's start.  I'm thinking of a question.  Mr. Adams -- is that what your nametag says?  Oh -- Ms. Adams.  Gotcha.  Ms. Adams, I'm thinking of a question.  What's the answer?

      The first day of classes just isn't that bad when you're a 2L.  It was fun to have new subjects, new professors, new classmates.  We'll see if it's still fun tomorrow.  And, as a change from 1L year, the seats aren't assigned.  Ten Tips When Choosing A Seat:  1. That guy with the hacking cough?  I'll be as far away from there as I can get. 2. Don't sit down on a seat that's got chewing gum on it. 3. The chair that's missing a wheel is not a good pick. 4. If the professor is using namecards to call on people, you want to write your name really small, add some extra consonants, and sit way in the back. 5. But if the professor is using a seating chart, you can sit anywhere as long as you make sure you don't write your name anywhere on the chart. 6. Even though they cost more, check out the luxury boxes on the third deck; they come complete with waiter service and a great view of the lectern. 7. Sitting on a friend's lap can be a real space-saver. 8. I try to avoid sitting next to the guy whose laptop emits an unusually loud hum. 9. The people who habitually eat in class do not make good neighbors.  Especially if they like to eat tuna fish. 10. Try switching your seat with the plush leather teacher's chair before class to experience the best in classroom comfort.

      I just found out that the law firm whose name is spelled "Dechert" is actually pronounced as if the h was a k.  Deckert.  Emphasis on syllable 1.  What's up with these French names being completely Americanized in their pronunciations?  Debevoise too is pronounced like it reads.  "S" included.  I guess they figure lawyers just aren't bright enough to deal.  Things I need to remember to do before my first class of the year (my first class of the year!) tomorrow:  1. Go to the bathroom 2. Turn the sound off on my laptop 3. Turn off my cell phone!! 4. Eat breakfast 5. Find a good seat... 6. ...hopefully next to someone who know... 7. ...but who isn't going to spend all class trying to whisper stuff to me... 8. ...because that's annoying. 9. Adjust my seat height 10. Pray not to be called on  I wonder if there are 2L and 3L gunners, or if they go away after a summer to reflect on their 1L year.  I bet there probably are, and it's probably the same people.  If I was a professor, I'd cut that gunner impulse off pretty quickly by just refusing to acknowledge someone's hand more than once or twice a class.  You can talk a couple of times, but then you're done.  Give other people a chance, stop monopolizing, if you have question sbeyond one or two, send an e-mail, ask your classmates, come to office hours.  Use your two turns wisely and you'll be fine.  No raising your hand while other people are talking, no audible sighs when someone messes up, no waving hands around in the air like you're a windmill.  Alternative plan: you speak four times in a class and that class becomes yours.  You get every question from there on in, like it or not.  Third plan: anybody who starts a sentence with the words, "Isn't it true..." gets a bullet through the head from the snipers on the rafters.  Same for "What if...."  No good question -- from a student, I mean -- ever starts with "what if...."  It's always "What if it wasn't really a human who started the fire, but a very smart polar bear?" or "What if the jail fell down?" or "What if the contract was signed in invisible ink?"  You're changing the rules.  It's not a contest to see what the most obscure rule you find is, or a contest to test how much of the minutiae the professor knows.  The only way these things should be allowed is if they can be actually acted out in class.  You want to ask about a spaceship crashing on the highway?  Fine.  All you need to do is have a spaceship crash into the classroom, and that question is totally fair game.  A botched surgery that yields a man with three legs?  In bounds, if you bring in the three-legged man.  The polar bear starting a fire?  Steal him from the zoo if you have to.  Things people shouldn't start questions with: 1. "I know this is obvious, but..." 2. "In my experience..." 3. "According to this other thing I read..." 4. "But where I come from..." 5. "I hate to interrupt, but..." 6. "Is it not the case that..." 7. "I feel compelled to jump in here..." 8. "I know this probably isn't relevant, but..." 9. "I don't mean to take us off course, but..." 10. "Can I just add something else here..."

      I'll link to it when it's posted on the web site, but in the meantime, here's my column from this current week's  urlLink Harvard Law Record  Career Guide.  I Should Probably Buy Some Dress Socks  This time last year, I wrote about how every 1L conversation really just revolves around the same four questions: whats your name, what section are you in, whered you go to college, and did you come straight through?  (Come straight through what?  The door?)  New year, new questions.  Whatd you do this summer, what classes are you taking, where are you living, and, the big one: You doing on-campus interviewing?  Its really not much of a question.  Ive yet to hear anyone say no.  Sure, Ive heard some hedging  only a few firms  twenty, thirty max, just on Wednesdays through Tuesdays, not if my smallpox doesnt clear up, depends on how my multi-state lottery ticket turns out  but everyones at least thinking about it.  Even me.  I must admit, Ive done my share of firm research, and come up with some simple tricks for eliminating certain firms from my bid list.  Rule one, no firms whose names sound like reproductive organs (goodbye, Allen & Overy).  Rule two, no firms that sound like food (goodbye, Fish & Richardson; goodbye, Pillsbury Winthrop).  Rule three, no firms that make crayons (goodbye, Binney & Smith).  And now that Im down to a manageable list of 694 firms, the real work begins.  First, of course, a look at the financial stability of these places.  I hadnt thought of this until a friend of mine mentioned he heard that one firm was melting its associates into coins with which to fill its empty coffers.  So thats important to watch out for.  Apparently, there are resources for finding this stuff out.  I dont know these resources.  The Cartoon Network and ESPN.com are apparently not them.  Although Daffy Ducks cousin has some great advice about supplemental insurance.  Second, a quick read of the firms websites.  One leading firm has a button at the bottom that reads, how to view our site.  What you get when you click on it is an explanation of how you need Real Player and Flash, and your own home network in order to really experience the sights and sounds they present.  What it really ought to say under how to view our site is:  You should view this site as a marketing piece designed to make us look humane, generous, and socially worthwhile.  The information you see on the site is not representative of who we are and what we do, but of what studies show youd like us to be.  The smiling men and women depicted on this site are actors and actresses; the lawyers didnt have time to come to the photo shoot, and looked like hell anyway.  We get most of our money from tobacco companies.  We get the rest from nuclear arms manufacturers.  Thank you for visiting.  I will fix my resume.  I will think about what Im really looking for, and do my best to find the firms that match.  I will rehearse answers to standard questions about why I want to work there, what kind of law I want to practice, and what kind of tree I would be, if I was a tree at all.  I will press my suit.  I will comb my hair.  I will shake hands firmly.  I will ask questions of my own that are neither infantile (how many urinals are in the mens room?) nor frightening (my sex change operation turned out pretty well, right?).  I will use this column as my writing sample.  That last one may be pushing it.

      Blogger seems to have gone down at about 3 AM last night (according to my counter), and just came back up sometime between lunchtime and now.  It's been doing that a lot lately.  It shouldn't, if it wants people to like it and keep using it.  Actual law school news.  Hmmm.  Sometime after my post yesterday regarding reading assignments in the professor's own casebook that look like code-breaker instructions (1-4, 8(top)-12(note 2), 345-352, 801-802(except note 3), 911, inside back cover), I got an e-mail from a classmate that said:  "From your Sept. 5 entry, it looks like you're taking [Class X with Professor Y]."  Actually, I'm not.  But that just proves it's a widespread phenomenon, not limited to this one class.  Our On-Campus Recruiting website is "open for bidding."  I'm about to go bid.  If there's anything funny about the website, and the process by which I have to enter my choices, I'll be sure to report.  More likely, it's probably just as one might expect, and not that interesting.

       urlLink Steve , a 3L at Ohio State, shares some bad interview advice for 2Ls.  My favorite is number three: "Never, ever stop talking."  The post right below his interview advice post talks about how he found out one of his professors reads his weblog, and then she asked him about his summer, "before realizing that she already knew how it went."  I find that it's of course neat in a lot of ways to find out that people I know read this thing, and, maybe even more so, people I really don't know.  But it does kind of leave me with a little bit less to say in person -- I worry a bit that I'm a letdown if someone reads faithfully... I feel a bit of pressure to be "on," to be funny, to be make up new weblog posts on the spot, or I'll be considered an imposter.  Sort of.  Not really.  Just reading Steve's post made me reflect on that a bit.  I met a 1L last week at an orientation event who reads this, and I started saying something, and one of my friends I'd been talking to said that it sounded like all of a sudden I was doing "shtick."  Which I guess I kind of was.  Sorry.

      Former Secretary of State Warren Christopher spoke at the law school today.  His advice: "Don't befriend child molesters."  Seriously.  It actually sort of made sense in context (he was saying that you should build your professional network, and stick by people when they're in trouble... unless they've done really bad things.  To wit, "don't befriend child molesters...")  But out of context it's pretty funny.  I was actually really impressed with him.

      I have no problem when professors do stuff like assigning "pages 1-4, 9-12, 176-183(top), 188-189(except note 2), 641(middle)-652, 891(note 4)" for a class, even though it's kind of a pain to keep turning pages and remembering where to stop and start.  But at least it shows they have some goal in mind and something they want to accomplish beyond how the casebook authors thought it should be taught.  What I don't understand is why that stuff happens *even when the professor wrote the casebook.*  If this is how the professor thinks it's taught best, why is the casebook all out of order?

      I started reading for classes today -- the first session of all three of my classes is on Monday, but there's a decent amount of reading to do before then.  It took me a little while to remember how to read... not that I forgot how to read, but that I forgot how to really concentrate and focus on what I'm reading, and be able to process it.  About twenty minutes of just sort of staring at the page before it started to come back to me.  And so I read a little bit of Constitutional Law, and then I read a little bit of Local Government Law... and then, the best thing ever to happen while reading for a law school class happened.  It's never happened to me before, and probably never will again.  But it was quite something.  For Con Law, one of the readings was Federalist #10.  And for Local Government Law, one of the readings was... Federalist #10.  Is there a feeling as grand as skipping right past 6 pages in the casebook because you've JUST READ THE SAME THING FOR ANOTHER CLASS??  It was as if the heavens were smiling down upon me.  It was, I daresay, as good as one can feel while in a law school library reading a casebook.  So I rewarded myself by wasting ten minutes checking my e-mail.  Ten Spam E-mail Headers You Never See:  1. "Lower your credit rating!" 2. "Enlarge your ears!" 3. "Magazine Subscriptions at 50% more than the cover price!" 4. "You owe money to the royal family of Nigeria and we are helping them to collect it." 5. "Ugly people are waiting to talk to you on the phone about their family problems." 6. "Get Poor Quick!" 7. "Domestic Long Distance for the same price you normally pay for International Calls." 8. "Win a free trip to jail!" 9. "Have you ever wanted a lower IQ?" 10. "Clicking on this is a waste of time."

      Countdown to On-Campus Interviewing!  We had On-Campus Interviewing orientation this afternoon.  We were given a "countdown checklist" which included the following instructions for preparing our interviewing wardrobe:  --> Shoes shined (if possible a professional shine) --> Shirts purchased and pressed (on hanger not folded) --> Purchase supply of socks or hose  Good thing they handed out this checklist, or I would have forgotten to wear socks!  From the notes I scrawled:  1. When the career services guy said, "the job market is improving," people clapped.  Uh, everyone who wanted a job last year got one.  How much can this really improve from that baseline?  And why are we clapping?  2. Firms are increasing revenue, but also increasing billable hours requirements.  Nobody clapped.  I have done enough research to know that "increased bilable hours requirements" is just a fancy way of saying "no weekends, buddy."  3. Summer perks are being reduced.  That's a fancy way of saying we're going to be buying our own lunch.  4. "I know you have the handout, and I know you can read it, but --" is never a fun way to start a sentence.  5. He said Harvard charges these firms "a lot of money" to come here and recruit.  "And I'll tell you how much."  $700.  I was expecting a much, much bigger number.  Although with 600-odd firms, that adds up.  But still.  That's like pocket change, kind of.  Of course, he did say that a lot of the cost is in lawyer time for interviewing and renting a room at the Hotel, and all that stuff, so I'm sure it does add up to quite a bit.  But the $700 entrance fee seems not so bad for these gazillion-dollar firms.  6. Non-discrimination policy: "any kind of discrimination is unacceptable."  What about discrimination based on interviewing skills?  7. Referring to a page on the website: "this page here is a subset of what you saw on the front page."  Thanks.  8. We have a bid limit of 35 firms, but we can add up to 5 firms a week to our list during the "add/drop period."  There are 3 weeks.  So we can theoretically have up to 50 interviews in 3 weeks.  That's a lot of interviews.  9. "I don't want to say that it's a utopia but last year's numbers speak for themselves."  Good thing the market's improving, eh?  10. "You don't want to be dating someone just because they have a pulse."  I thought this was interviewing advice, not dating advice.  Actually, though, I could use some of both.  11. 52 minutes into the presentation -- "we will keep this short."  Excellent.

      Got a 1L facebook in my mailbox today.   urlLink Waddling Thunder  has a chart of how many 1Ls come from a selection of schools, this year compared to last year.  I can't imagine what conclusions anyone could draw from his chart, or why the information is terribly interesting or important, but it's there, in case anyone's curious.  For anyone who worries that everyone at Harvard Law School comes from Harvard and Yale (of course, a lot of them do), here are some represented colleges and universities that I haven't really heard of before (which obviously means absolutely nothing; as I think I've said before, I certainly haven't noticed any correlation at all between where any of my classmates went to undergrad and anything about what goes on at law school... the admissions people have gobs of qualified candidates to pick from; obviously everyone here did something right, no matter where he or she went to school).  Somewhere in this list is one I'm making up.  Find it and win!  Alma College, Berry College, Bridgewater College, Colorado School of Mines, The Evergreen State College, Gustavus Adolphus College, Hillsdale College, Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania, Magdalen College, Messiah College, Pacific Union College, St. Cloud State University, University de Deusto, University of Phoenix Online, University of Tokyo.  Of similar uselessness: consider yourself more likely to go to Harvard if your first name is David (13), Michael (12), Jennifer (9), Adam (8), Daniel (7), Jeffrey (7), Joshua (7), Andrew (6), James (6), Kevin (6), Benjamin (5), Charles (5), Emily (5), John (5), Nicholas (5), Rebecca (5), Sarah (5), and Stephen (5).  Making this list tells me there are fewer common guys names than girls names, because they seem to be more concentrated.  If the Davids had a tug-of-war with the Michaels (and let's give the Michaels the 1 Kurt we've got, just to make it even as far as numbers), I wonder who would win.  It's these kinds of second-level questions that the facebook can't answer.

      Today was "registration" for 2Ls and 3Ls, which consisted of signing a form to verify your name and address, trading in the form for a renewed ID card, and picking up a bunch of freebies from our good friends at Lexis and Westlaw.  Westlaw, with its pen/highlighter combo, pocket-sized federal rules of evidence, and (the tiebreaker) a pretty sweet frisbee, narrowly beats out Lexis and its fancy plastic highlighter, foam cup holder, keychain, and even-smaller-pocket-sized federal rules of evidence.  This afternoon is the On-Campus Interviewing orientation for all 2Ls.  Questions I hope nobody asks but I'm sure they will:  1. I'm planning on splitting my summer in thirds between Seattle, Detroit, and the moon.  I wanted to know which firms I should be looking at, and was hoping you could take up everybody else's time by answering that for me right now.  2. When I turned in my resume, you made a stray mark by one of the lines.  I was wondering if you meant anything by that.  I've brought a plastic overhead so you can project it for everyone to see and we can discuss.  3. Here's my list of thirty firms.  Can you tell me everything you know about them?  4. Can I leave to go to the bathroom?  5. I'm an PhD student, and not actually looking to work at a law firm.  But I came today to try and find out the psychology behind choosing which cities people want to work in.  I was hoping we could go around the room and everyone could tell me the cities they're going to be interviewing for jobs in, and why they've chosen them.  6. I have a disability I'd rather not share with the group.  Could you tell us all about every firm's policy for dealing with students with disabilities like mine?  7. I didn't receive an offer at the firm I worked at last summer.  I have a very long and detailed story I'm going to tell about this, and end by not really asking a question so much as just complaining that it's not fair.  Thanks.  8. Can you recite a list of the other career services events that'll be coming up over the next three or four months, slowly and also in German?  9. I came in late.  Can you start over?  10. I can't find a seat.  Can everybody stand up and we'll play musical chairs in order to determine how the 400 seats for 550 students are allocated in a fair and equitable manner?

      1Ls start classes here today.  A poem:  So you walk in the classroom And locate your seat As you wish you'd had more Than a corn flake to eat As you boot up your laptop Your eyes scan the crowd There's the ones awfully quiet And the ones awfully loud There are people who look Like they've done this before There's the people who found The *used* books at the store There are hands getting ready To pounce in the air There are those who put thought Into what they would wear There are guys wearing dress shirts That seem a bit, well... There are girls with new outfits It's easy to tell There are some who seem frantic Perhaps they didn't read So if they're the ones called on Your prayers they may need There are some who are breathing So loud you can hear They are shaking with angst They are oozing with fear As the teacher, she enters All eyes turn to her What's the class gonna be like? What frights will occur? She opens her casebook She flips to the page She welcomes you warmly But this is *her*stage You're not the one called on You slowly exhale Your fingers start typing Each tiny detail Of the words that are spoken The thoughts that you hear It's just class like all others Away fades the fear You have done this already It's school, you're okay Your mind starts to wander Your thoughts start to stray But you're jarred back to focus From out of blue The teacher looks up And she's calling on you And you didn't hear the question You look down at the page Around at your classmates Seems *you're* now on stage And you mumble and bumble And feel your way through Ask for clarification Pray a thought comes to you You say one thing, another Some wrong, some okay And then after what seems like At least half a day She retreats and goes after A classmate, a friend As your moment of terror Has come to an end The class ends and you exit You ask "how'd I do?" And you're kind of surprised None recall it was you Some were drifting or fading Exactly like you Some were in their heads thinking Of what they would do If the cards drew them next No one listened to you Sure it's nice to do well But what can you do And you stumble from class Vowing better next day But you realize it's all Gonna turn out okay.

      Harvard's career services website contains a fairly long list of questions to be prepared to answer during a law firm interview.  The last section on the page is labeled "Odd Balls."  Ignoring the fact that I believe "oddball" is actually one word, not two, I thought I'd post four of them that I found especially unnerving to contemplate:  1. My license plate says TRIAL.  What would yours say?  WRONG ANSWER: "Unemployed."  2. If you won the lottery tomorrow, would you still be in law school?   WRONG ANSWER: "Yes, but I wouldn't be interviewing for a job at this firm."  3. Your resume says you speak French.  Lets conduct this interview in French.  WRONG ANSWER: "Si, senor."  4. If you found out you had 24 hours to live, how would you spend them?   RIGHT ANSWER: "Checking footnotes on a journal article."

      How the other half lives: I've found myself talking to some people on Law Review a couple of times over the last few days.  Most of what they've said's been relatively as expected... it's a lot of work, but obviously the rewards are good; the people are pretty nice in general; you get used to the work; etc.  The one surprising piece I've heard:  Apparently, there's a defined set of computers on which changes to articles can be entered -- so they have assigned "type-ins" where people sit at these computers and enter these changes.  And, apparently, there are enough changes to enter that people need to be assigned to these computers 24 hours a day.  So there are people with shifts like 1AM-4AM, or the like.  Crazy, ain't it?  Another thing I've heard re: law review -- law firms apparently like to hire these people.  And you wonder why.  :)

      Note 1: "Sleeping off a sunburn" doesn't quite work.  I'm still pretty red.  How in the world did sunscreen just not even cross my mind?  I've got a tube of it in my room; I just didn't think about it.  Argh.  Note 2: The Office of Career Services has an online appointment-making system.  About a week ago, I set up an appointment with one of the advisors for 10:40 this morning.  Not realizing it's Labor Day, but also not really caring.  The system sent me a reminder yesterday.  I'm going to show up at 10:40.  My gut tells me no one's going to be there.  We'll see.  Note 3: I have no note 3. I thought that typing "Note 3" would inspire me to come up with one.  It didn't.

      The A-to-Z Guide to Callback Interviews.  (Is this a long enough post for ya?)  A is for ANSWERS -- After all of the on-campus interviews, it's easy to have a good sense of the kinds of questions that you're going to need to have answers to.  I found that the callbacks were generally pretty similar in that way to the on-campus stuff -- the questions I was asked were pretty much the same as they'd been, and I found myself going back to a lot of the themes and responses that I had given on campus.  Of course, there were questions I had better and worse answers for on-campus -- not "trick" questions, just stuff on my resume I liked talking about (writing stuff, for example), and stuff I didn't, and didn't really have an articulate, good answer for ("what's the journal article you're working on about?") -- and it was pretty much inexcusable that I hadn't gone back in between the on-campus stuff and the callbacks and come up with some solid sound bites.  Given that people had asked certain questions, I should have figured they'd come up again in the callbacks, and solidified my responses so I didn't sound like a moron.  I didn't really do that in a couple of cases ("sorry, what's that journal article about again?"), and ended up feeling a little silly.   B is for BIG -- Some of these firms are huge.  Like "7 people named Goldberg" huge.  I was surprised (though perhaps I shouldn't have been) that a lot of the times, when one interviewer was taking me to my next one, they didn't know each other, and in fact had never met.  Or the lawyer had trouble navigating the hallways and finding a certain room number.  Or didn't seem to know anyone we passed along the way.  Obviously you can't know everyone in a 500-person law firm.  But if nobody seems to know anybody, it makes me wonder how friendly the firm is, just a little bit.  Is it a place filled with strangers, or a comfortable, collegial environment?  ALTERNATE CHOICE: B was going to stand for bathrooms, since given the hours lawyers work, it's inevitable you'll be using them, probably for at least two different kinds of things (although there may be more...).  It would be nice if they were clean.  C is for CAFETERIA -- Like the bathrooms, this is important stuff -- and in fact, there may be an inverse relationship at work.  The better the cafeteria, the less time you'll spend in the bathroom.  I asked about the cafeteria a couple of times -- usually in the elevators, if I saw someone bringing up a box of particularly grotesque-looking cafeteria food (can we outlaw the sale of lima beans, please?), I'd ask the lawyer who was taking me to the next interview how the food generally was, and if people ate in the cafeteria.  Mostly got pretty negative answers.  Even from the firm that bragged about it in their brochure.  Hint: if you brag about the food in your recruiting brochure, at least tell the associates to lie when people ask about it.  Actions in one case spoke louder than words: cafeteria in the building; fast food wrappers on at least a bunch of desks I saw.  Subway?  Wendy's?  Come on, you earn enough money for at least KFC....  D is for DESKS -- At first, I couldn't believe how much paper these people had on their desks.  Piles and piles of paper.  On the desk, under the desk, coming out from all sides of the desk.  The myth of the paperless office.  One guy who interviewed me had literally not a square inch of desk visible, and not only were papers pouring out from underneath his desk, but I saw a box of tissues, some paper plates covered with half-eaten food, and a family of small rodents (I'll skip the lawyers as rodents joke analogy here...).  Some people's desks were clean and their offices lovely.  It's not that hard.  And it's awfully intimidating to have to talk to someone over stacks and stacks of paper.  "This is your life," the piles seemed to be screaming.  "Run.  While you still can."  E is for ELEVATORS -- One of my classmates, as we both waited in a firm's lobby for our interviewers, mentioned that he'd been making it a habit to ask, "What's the worst thing about working here?"  I thought it was a great question, and stole it from him for the rest of the process.  Although I only used it when it felt right, or I was out of other stuff to say -- it was my "please don't ask me any more questions" question.  Some of the answers I got were predictable -- "the hours," "the long hours," "the lack of free time," "the long hours and the lack of free time," and "the long hours, lack of free time, and overall miserableness" (really) -- but three times (not just once, I tell ya -- three times!), the answer I got was "the elevators."  Either they're slow, or they're crowded, or you have to go all the way down to the lobby and switch... it was a great answer, actually -- because if the elevators *really* are the worst part of the job, it must be a great job.  But let's get real -- the elevators cannot, absolutely cannot possibly, be the worst part of any job except for elevator operator.  And even then, it's probably the people more than the elevators.  F is for FACE TIME -- Apparently, face time refers to the need to stay in the office even when you have no work to do, just because you feel like you're expected to be there.  The "right" answer, I suppose, is "there's no face time -- if you have nothing to do, no one expects you to be here."  This answer's loveliness is dulled when any of the following caveats are added: "...although if it's early, like 7 or 8, people usually stick around because it looks bad;" "...but usually I'll come in on the weekend, just so people see that I'm here;" "...but it's not like any associates leave before all of the partners have;" "...so as long as you explain why you left early the next day when a partner calls you into the office to question you, you'll usually be okay."  G is for GRADES -- I got asked about one grade, once.  I have one grade on my transcript that doesn't quite fit, so it made sense for someone to ask me about it, I guess.  I gave an honest answer, which was that honestly I don't know exactly what happened, other than I just didn't give very good answers to the questions on the test, and must not have had a great grasp of the subject, but oh well.  I have no idea if there are better answers out there, but I kinda liked it.  I expected more people would have something -- anything -- to say about grades, but I guess they all pretty much speak for themselves on paper, and everyone's look kinda the same anyway.  ALTERNATE CHOICE: G is for GOOGLE.  As far as I can tell, no one Googled me.  In a moment of food-induced guard-down edge-teetering, at one lunch Google somehow came up, and I found myself saying, "I don't think anyone's googled me throughout this whole process."  Of course, the reply was, "oh -- maybe we should then."  And maybe they did.  Who knows.  I'm cool with it either way, but just thought I'd report on the fact that I don't think anyone did, since no one mentioned finding this thing, and if I googled someone and found 200,000 words they'd written, I'd probably bring it up.  ANOTHER ALTERNATE CHOICE: G is for GHASTLY THINGS THAT INTERVIEWERS TELL YOU WITHOUT REALIZING EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.  "On the day of the blackout, I had a big project, so I carried my laptop with me down the 45 flights of stairs, and then got a ride into Jersey with some co-workers, just so I could plug in and get my work done."  That wins the bronze medal.  With the silver: "What's the best thing about working here?  Well, the hours suck, the work's pretty boring, and I have no time to spend with friends and family.  But what makes it all worthwhile is that when someone asks me what I do for a living, I can tell them that I work for one of the top law firms in the world.  And that makes up for all the rest."  And the gold medal goes to: "I don't think anyone here, if they could have looked ten years into the future, would have chosen to come here.  I don't think they would have chosen this lifestyle.  And if they say anything different, I think they're lying."  H is for HOURS -- Apparently they're long.  Apparently the code word for long hours is, "we are not a lifestyle firm."  Everyone said that.  Better yet, "this is not a lifestyle career."  Better yet, from one hiring partner: "This is not a friendly place.  We work hard.  I used to have friends.  I haven't seen a friend since I started working here.  I don't see my family.  I don't spend time with my kids.  I cancel vacations, I work weekends, I'm here well into the night.  When you work for a firm like this, you make sacrifices.  You're at the mercy of the clients.  If they need you, you're here.  If something gets in the way -- friends, family, outside interests -- well then that's tough... but the work comes first."  I is for IGNORANCE -- Read the websites.  The answer to "what do you know about us?" is not "not that much," or so I've been told.  I found myself relatively uncomfortable when I found myself unsure how many lawyers the particular firm had and was asked "What size firm are you looking for?  Really big, or not that big?"  Or if I was asked whether I knew how their summer program worked and couldn't remember if it was this firm's website that talked about the rotation and the other firm was free-for-all, or the other way around.  Ignorance looks bad, and feels bad.  Take the time to read the websites, do some Lexis searching... I found all of the time I did spend doing that stuff definitely paid off, even if just in comfort level.  J is for JOKES -- One of the less charismatic interviewers I had said, "I like to joke around at work.  I'm probably one of the more relaxed, fun-loving people here."  This guy seemed about as fun-loving as Roger Clemens with a broken bat in his hands (aside: if I had dressed up for Halloween three years ago, that would have been my costume.  This year?  It would have been dressing up as Don Zimmer and periodically rolling around on the ground.  Fun stuff.).  I had a few interviewers say things that made me laugh.  Some inappropriately (see second alternate G entry above), but some genuinely and legitimately.  I liked that.  Funny people are nice to work with.  On the flip side: I had a few standard lines and stories that I used that theoretically I thought could elicit a chuckle.  Some did, some didn't.  Maybe it was me.  K is for KEEPING THE WEIRD ONES LOCKED UP -- At every firm, at least one interviewer admitted that there were some "weird ones" that they don't let interview people, and they keep locked in their offices during recruiting season.  I found the consistency of this revelation to be interesting.  Each firm would follow it up with something like, "...but I think we have fewer of those than a lot of the other firms," but it always kind of took me by surprise.  I want to meet some of these people who have been deemed to be weirder than the ones actually interviewing.  These people that have been deemed so awful that they can't be let out.  What are their problems exactly?  "Well," says the imaginary partner in my mind, "there's the horrifically ugly man-child, the hunchback, the spit-talker, the screamer, and the lice-infested beard guy, just for starters...."  L is for LUNCHES -- Don't let them schedule a lunch if you're (a) in a hurry, or (b) you've eaten already that week.  I'm generally relatively frugal (read: cheap), and don't eat in places where lunch entrees cost $25 anyway... but if I did, I wouldn't be ordering $12 appetizers and $10 desserts too.  But I'm not a lawyer yet.  The appetizers seemed to be standard (I never ordered first -- I wanted to see what the lawyer people would order and copy them, basically), dessert was standard... these were big meals.  They were good, but they were big.  It was weird to go to lunch with two associates who didn't know each other.  Because then conversation seemed kind of strained at times.  Or with quiet people.  "How do you like working at the firm?"  "I like it."  But sometimes it worked and it was nice, and pleasant, and useful.  But long!  (P.S. Order the fish -- no knives needed to cut fish.  Bad things to order, while wearing a suit and on an interview: Ribs, anything crunchy, things with bones or eyes)   M is for MISTAKES -- During the callbacks, there are three things I said that I would call mistakes, either for inappropriateness or just out of generic stupidity. The bronze medal: "...so we'd have task forces, small seminar classes about a certain topic.  Like one I had on children's privacy on the Internet.  We talked about stuff like how certain websites would collect information -- one website for teenage girls, for example, was asking them when they first started menstruating, things like that." (What in the world possessed me to use the word 'menstruating' in an interview???)  The silver: "Any more questions?  Uh... hmmm... uh... is your training all in one clump at the beginning, or is it spread out over a long time?  Uh, actually that's a pretty stupid question, uh, let me think of another one."  (Smoooooth...)  And the gold goes to: "Yeah, I worked for Senator Schumer for a summer.  What was he like?  Well, he seems pretty small on TV, but he's actually really fat.  He's got a small upper body, but quite a big gut.  He's a big guy, it's surprising.  Oh -- you meant what was *it* like -- the job -- not what was *he* like -- oh, okay."  N is for NAKED -- Don't go to callback interviews naked.  ALTERNATIVE CHOICE: N is for NICE.  The views are nice, the furniture is nice, the lunches are nice, the glossy recruiting brochures are nice.  Some of the lawyers are nice.  It's nice to talk to nice people.  It's less nice to talk to less nice people.  I like it when the lawyers are nice.  Friendly.  Warm.  Polite.  Genuine.  These are things that give good feelings and make me think it'd be okay to work there.  Be nice.  It's nicer that way.  O is for OFFER -- Self-explanatory.  The first letter I filled in.  Yet I don't have much to say about the offers.  Either we get it or we don't.  Some combination of the resume and transcript and these interviews I guess.  I wonder how many offers these firms make to fill their ideal class size.  With so many firms competing, I bet some of these places need to make quite a many offers to get the 50, 60, 70 people they're looking for in their summer classes.  Would be interesting to see how that varies firm to firm and if the yield %s mirror the Vault rankings or there are differences.  P is for PART-TIME -- A couple of people who interviewed me told me they work part-time schedules.  I asked one what that meant: "9-7 Monday through Thursday, occasionally a little bit on the weekend."  Yeah, I guess that's part-time.  Full-time would be all 168 hours of the week.  I sleep part-time too.  Q is for QUESTIONS -- If I could give one piece of advice to someone, and only one (then this post wouldn't be nearly this long), I'd say that you should come up with tons and tons of questions to ask these people.  General questions, specific questions, lots and lots of questions.  More than in the on-campus interviews, a lot of the callbacks were just the person asking me if I had any questions.  "I'm all questioned out" feels embarassing to say when you haven't asked a question.  "What's the best thing about working here?" was a standard one I used to try and get them talking and hopefully leading to other questions I'd have or they'd have.  But when the answer was "the work is challenging," or "I like the money" (heard both of those a bunch), I was often starting to run dry.  "Worst thing about working here?" "Why did you choose this place?" "How's work assigned in the summer program?" "Cafeteria good?" "What do you think of the Yankees..."  I sometimes found myself scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Think of better ones.  In advance.  It's hard on the spot.  R is for REJECTION -- I've seen some weblog posts about rejection quickly vs. slowly, phone vs. letter, etc.  I have no opinions.  I don't need them to call me -- I'll get the hint.  Letting me know somehow, relatively quickly, is great -- but if this is keeping people up at night, they deserve to have a long wait.  I'm pretty sure everyone gets a job somewhere.  It all works out.  If it's the right match, they'll let us know.  S is for SUITS -- Yay for business casual.  If only the interviews could be too.  I feel funny wearing a suit, especially to the lunch, when everyone else is jacket-and-tie-free.  I guess I'm not really that bothered by the suit, although it's warm under all the layers, but it'd be nicer to be able to skip it.  I think.  T is for TAKING VACATIONS -- One interviewer said she wanted to "pre-emptively" tell me that she takes all her vacation time, because most people ask.  I hadn't been asking.  Then I started asking.  Some do, some don't.  Some firms seem to cancel vacations, some don't.  I like the ones that don't better.  All else being equal.  One person told me the firm has a policy that if you work more than 4 hours on a day you're on vacation it doesn't count as a vacation day.  At first that sounded good.  Then I realized the mere fact they have a policy about this....  Uh oh.  U is for UNIQUE SELLING PROPOSITION -- "We're the friendly firm," "We're the laid-back firm," "We're the collegial firm," "We're the humane firm."  Pick an adjective.  They're on sale.  Each firm seemed to have a message it was trying to convey. "We do important work," "We have smart people," "We work hard."  No repeats.  Find your own uniqueness.  But not too unique.  V is for VAULT.COM -- I don't know what the Vault rankings are actually ranking.  I can't find a methodology.  But people seem to listen.  I don't know if they're "right" or not, and what it all means.  Does it matter?  I don't know.  Someone tell me.  Unless I don't really want to know.  W is for WINDOWS -- Nice views, out every window, from every firm.  They're all on the 57th floor somewhere, so you see something.  It's cool.  I enjoyed the views.   X is for X-PECTATIONS -- I found that the firms I expected to like the best, I didn't necessarily, and a couple that I'd been less interested in really surprised me.  They all say to judge based on the "people," since the work's largely the same.  But we meet 4 people.  Yet -- yet -- I really did feel a difference in mood and personality between the firms.  Random stuff, people smiling, were the doors open, how much light, stuff like that.  At some places it clicked, at some it didn't.  I think that's all we have to go on though....  Y is for YAWNING -- I sometimes couldn't stop.  It's terrible, I know.  Z is for ZOOBILEE ZOO -- Can you think of a better Z?  Zoobilee Zoo was a TV show where people dressed up like animals.  We dress up in suits.  Close enough?  That's a lot of words.  If you stuck with me all the way to the end, thanks.  You're probably ready for a nap.  Me too.

      I am back in the land of free-Internet, and have finished all of my callback interviews.  Apologies for the short posts the last couple of days.  I'll make up for it.  I hope to be able to wrap up all talk about this kind of stuff pretty soon, but since it's the only law-related stuff on my mind for now, I'll try to at least extract some humor from it.

      Again at Kinko's (a different one).  Tomorrow I'll be back in free-Internet land and, coincidentally, will also be done with interviewers.  I'll post something longer then, no worries.  I've got the first 300 words of something percolating in my head.  Good callback today, I liked the people.  I don't what else there is to go on.  I keep running into classmates of mine at these firms' offices (not surprising), in the subway stations (more surprising), and randomly passing on the street (kind of surprising).

      Posting this at a Kinko's in between two callback interviews today.  My only day with two.  It's a grind.  Talking about myself all day.  Gosh.  From one interviewer this morning: "...my son does some writing too.  He has some sort of 'blog' or something like that."  Me: "Oh."  And I could have mentioned mine, because I really don't think I have anything on here I have any problem with any of these firms reading.  But I figured why bother.  I did tell an interviewer he can find my law school newspaper columns on the web if he wants to read them (he asked if I had any samples on me), so he may very well stumble across this if he was actually interested and bothers to search around (if you're reading this, hi!  I'm writing this from the Kinko's that's a block away from your office!  :).  But I'm guessing not.  And that's fine too.  Biggest thing I'm taking from these callbacks (besides brochures and NALP reimbursement forms...) is the real difference in "feel" among different places.  There's definitely a continuum of intensity, from "a normal, regular workplace" to "this is not your normal workplace.  this is a new york law firm."  That's not a negative/positive continuum; it just is.  More to say when this is all over I guess.  This is costing me 30 cents a minute to type.  Making me wonder if it'd be worth 30 cents a minute to read...

      A very very very good article about  urlLink Tina Fey  that almost makes me forget that Saturday Night Live just isn't very funny.  And... a short song parody inspired by the myths more than the reality of these interviews:  (To the tune of "Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow")  Oh, you say the work will be delighting That the cases will be exciting But you'll be chaining me to the floor Pay me more, pay me more, pay me more  Oh, you want me to work these long hours Give up interests, sleep, and showers Trade my wife in for a whore Pay me more, pay me more, pay me more  When I finally get to go Will I see that my life's gone away? So to not make me see that, I know That I'll have no choice but to stay  Oh, in forty years I could be wealthy And besides the 6 heart attacks, healthy But I might have turned into a bore Pay me more, pay me more, pay me more

      This post is an exaggeration, and refers to just a small sample of the places I've visited.  I'm not intending to generalize, just to note a specific kind of thing that's out there.  "I used to have friends, but since I started working here, it's hard to find time, and so I don't really anymore."  That's not verbatim at all.  But sentiments like that -- I don't think it's a real effective recruiting line for a lawyer to say when he's interviewing someone.  These mostly aren't things I've actually heard -- I'm trying to exaggerate for effect here -- but these would be equally ineffective lines.  If you're interviewing people, you might want to avoid them:  >"I've only pulled 5 or 6 all-nighters... in the past week." >"I don't understand work-life balance.  Work *is* life.  Isn't that enough?" >"Sure, I don't know how many kids I have.  But at least I'm filthy rich." >"I know my secretary's name.  Oh wait, no I don't." >"I know my wife's name.  Oh wait, that was the third wife.  What am I on now, six, seven?" >"You have interests on your resume.  You're not planning on doing those things while working here, are you?" >"You can leave and have dinner with friends.  As long as you come back afterwards." >"I work part-time.  5 days a week, 9 AM - 7 PM.  A reduced schedule." >"We have Broadway tickets.  No one's ever been able to get out of work in time to go." >"Everyone I know who's a lawyer is sad.  Here, you'll be no sadder than anywhere else."

      I hear LSAT scores have come out.  Some handy "just got my score" advice from another blogger over  urlLink here .  My take on it:  1.  If you really really really messed up, and you think you can do better than you did, take it again.  This whole interview season thing tells me that some advice  urlLink this blogger  gave a while ago was right -- you kinda do want to go to the best school you can if you want to maximize your chances of getting a high-paying lawyer job (or getting into academia) afterwards.  Of course, if your reasons for going to law school don't involve the high-paying lawyer job (and I say that absolutely with a straight face -- tons of other reasons to be at law school, whether they be other kinds of lawyer jobs, job advancement that may require a law degree, just want to learn cool stuff about law, bored and wealthy... I'm sure more I'm not thinking of), then maybe no big deal.  But it really does seem like where you go to school correlates kind of strongly (probably too strongly) with the job stuff available to you right out of school, and LSAT score correlates kind of strongly with where you get in.  So maybe not terrible advice to perhaps think about taking it again if you know you should have done better and really think you can.  Of course, every situation is different; this isn't great advice for every situation.  Obviously.  2. If you did much better than you thought you'd do, probably don't take it again.  Yes, I had to go and ruin a serious post with an attempt at humor.  Sorry about that.  But, seriously, if you aced the thing and thought you'd be going to University of Phoenix Online and now you can get into Yale, congratulations and never tell anyone you thought you'd get a 132 and got 45 points higher.  3. If you got about what you thought you'd get, and it's not as good as you'd want, but you don't know what to do about it, take a deep breath.  And ignore point #1.  It's elitist and silly.  People who do really really well pretty much everywhere get jobs at exactly the same places that people at the very top schools do.  Location starts to matter -- if you want to work in Kansas, don't go to law school in Nebraska (ed. note: Kansas and Nebraska are right next to each other.  My response:  Oops.  Yeah, I guess maybe they are.  I just lump them all together in the big mass in the middle.).  But yeah, location may matter -- go to school where you want to work -- and you have to do really really well for certain jobs -- but doors are not all closed.  Still lots of opportunities.  You'll survive, you'll have a law degree, you'll be fine.  4. If you received your score report, but accidentally lost it before opening it and don't know how you did, call the LSAT people.  I'm sure for something like $428, they can send you another copy.  If you beg.

      My laptop is stupid.  It doesn't know it's daylight savings time.  Every other computer on the whole planet knows to change the clock, and my computer doesn't.  Stupid.  Almost as stupid as my watch, which keeps inexplicably getting faster and faster.  I set it to be three minutes fast about three months ago.  It's nine minutes fast now.  Well, an hour and nine minutes fast.  But the hour is because of daylight savings time obviously.  Stupid computer.  I have to manually change the time now.  And then probably tomorrow it'll remember it should've changed and it'll be an hour behind.  Check out  urlLink Diary of a Stand-Up Comedian  for a really, really, really compelling take on the life of an aspiring stand-up comic.  It's really human.  That's the best word I've got for it.  I stumbled onto it through a confluence of links I clicked on, and just read the entire site over the past couple of hours.  There's a lot of words there.  I generally don't particularly like most of what I read, especially when it's just some random person's weblog (but of course I'm glad your standards are low enough to come visit mine... :).  This I couldn't bring myself to stop reading.  Read it.  Tomorrow I get to experience the first of a handful of "callback lunches."  These are, not to be obvious, lunches that firms take you on if you have a morning callback.  Two associates and me at this one that I've got tomorrow.  I'm confident the restaurant they take me to will at least be decent, hopefully more.  When I was on the phone scheduling they asked if I had any dietary restrictions.  I was tempted to make something up.  "Can't eat anything orange" could be kind of funny to see if they could work around.  "Strict carnivore; no vegetables" would be a pretty solid ticket to a steakhouse I guess.  "Allergic to anything that begins with the letter 'B'" would test them pretty well.  "Only foods with three syllables" would start to sound like an improv comedy game.  Five Things I Probably Shouldn't Eat At Lunch Since I Only Have One Suit and One Dress Shirt That Doesn't Already Need a Cleaning  1. Anything with a red sauce 2. Anything with any sauce at all 3. Anything with any liquid ingredients 4. Anything with any substance that could potentially stick to me 5. Anything with any color  I'll be enjoying ice and plastic for lunch.  Perhaps some broken glass for dessert.  Four Foods I Wish I -- (naw, make that "Everyone") -- Was Allergic To  1. Brains 2. Feet 3. Mayonnaise 4. Cauliflower

      800 Words About Callback Interviews  A partner said to me, Look, the work is going to be pretty much the same at any of these places.  Unless you have a very specific kind of law youre looking to practice, and everyone says this firm or that firm is the absolute leader in that field, then the works going to be the same wherever you go.  And you can say youre going to choose based on the people, but the people everywhere are going to tell you that the people there are great; and if they didnt like the people there, they wouldnt still be working there, so what can you really tell from that?  Plus you meet a handful of lawyers out of the hundreds in each place  its not a big enough sample.  Think of it this way: really there are no wrong choices.  Youll end up here, or youll end up down the street, but wherever you are, its all pretty much the same.  And with that, my callback interviews were off and running.  Its hard to go through this process without feeling like youre turning into a cartoon version of yourself.  In reruns.  Heres the episode where I talk about my senior thesis and the lawyer nods her head.  It's been on seven times this week.  Like South Park.  Here's the episode where I accidentally walk into the wall.   In between interviews at one firm, I asked the recruiter who was escorting me from room to room if I could use the restroom.  She looked at me as if Id violated some rule of interview etiquette  that we ought to be trained well enough to know not to drink too much before the interviews, because a good lawyer doesnt ever go to the bathroom.  He just absorbs it all back into his bloodstream.  On the way to the bathroom, I concocted an elaborate story that I would use to explain my trip just in case one of the lawyers were to accuse me of unprofessionalism for having gone to the bathroom in the middle of the callback interview process.  It was research, I decided.  Surely seeing how clean a firms bathroom is can be an important factor in making the ultimate decision.  I was forcing myself to go when I didnt really have to, just to do some undercover bathroom research.  Yes, that was it.  And sparkling clean.  They won points for that.  Three points, to be exact.  Three points on my firm-o-matic ranking machine (licensed by Vault, by the way).  Bathroom cleanliness is worth a maximum of three points; variety of snacks in vending machines can earn up to seven points, a water cooler is an automatic five, every plush piece of furniture I pass is worth one-and-a-half, and every painting of an unidentifiable landscape that looks nothing like a city is worth two for atmosphere.  It does seem like the art in some of these offices shares a similar theme.  Weve all moved into the big city because the work is exciting here and life is grand.  So lets put up paintings of fields and farms and hilltops and meadows on the wall.  Remind us of life back before we lived in an antiseptic office building for a hundred hours a week.  I walk into the second lawyers office.  She must have been chosen as one of my interviewers because we have the same color eyes.  I feel like I imagine the interviewers are more carefully chosen for us than they really are, and I find myself thinking up complex reasons for why Ive been assigned to meet with each of these people.  Her husband works for a software company.  I used to work for a software company.  That must be it.  Hes a baseball fan; I mentioned in my on-campus interview I like baseball.  She just came here from the firm down the street and really wants to talk smack about it; I mentioned to the recruiter by accident that the firm down the street is really my first choice.  Oh, wait.  That one might actually make sense.  But seriously, I have a friend at a firm who burst my bubble on this one.  They send out e-mails that ask whos free to interview on Thursday at 4, he said.  And thats how they pick the interviewers.  Oh.  And next he told me theres no Santa Claus.  Its such a letdown.  Santa Claus in the lobby, by the way: four points.  Two-ply toilet paper: three points.  People saying hello to each other when they pass in the hall: ten points.  People spitting on each other when they pass in the hall: minus ten points.  People leaping from the windows  floors 1-25: minus five points; floors 25-50: minus ten points; floors 50+: minus fifteen points.  Free food: one point per bite.  Heck, my system probably makes more sense than whatever it is Vault does.

       urlLink This  is a really really really interesting article in this weekend's NY Times magazine about how lots of well-educated, smart, driven women are stepping out of the workforce to raise their children, and are finding that life more fulfilling than perhaps working 80 hours a week at a law firm, or becoming a corporate CEO, or running the world.  My reaction to the article: What's wrong with this?  They're smart.  There's more to life than 80-hour work weeks.  I think.  I hope.  I sometimes wonder why the ideal that's held up for us to strive for involves lots of money, lots of power, lots of responsibility -- but not always lots of fulfillment.  It's not work-life balance I'm talking about.  It's finding a meaningful life, whatever combination that entails -- finding work that doesn't feel like work, so you're happy to do it; finding life that really makes days worth living.  I don't know what the magic combination is, what the answers are -- but at least let's ask the questions.  Is a six-figure salary always worth it?  Good article.  Read the article.

      Firm #2 had just as much paper on the desks as Firm #1, so I guess it's a lawyer thing.  Lots of piles of paper.  On a different note: I was talking to friend today who works at a law firm, and he was telling me about how the interviewers we see on these callback interviewers really aren't as well-chosen as we might think.  I've been coming up with complicated explanations for each person I see -- "well, they wanted me to talk to this person because he's interested in this, and that person because she went to the same undergrad as me, and this person because his eyes are the same color as mine..." -- but he said that basically they just send out an e-mail that asks who'd be willing to help out with interviewing on Thursday afternoon, they see who replies, and they put together interview schedules, trying to balance out associates and partners, or trying to minimize the amount of in-building travel, or trying to fit it around someone's conference call -- but that there's not nearly as much deliberation as we might think there is.  Which I guess makes sense, since they have lots of other things to spend time on and actually coming up with reasons for each interviewer and then making the scheduling work seems like it might be a huge undertaking.  Of course, my friend only knows about his firm, and other firms may be different.  But it's interesting to think about.  The biggest message I'm getting so far in this process is that generally, for all but the most specialized interests, most of these firms acknowledge that the work is pretty much the same no matter where you are, and the differences really come down to the people, and the culture, and other stuff that's hard to get a handle on in the interview process.  And that basically there are no wrong choices, and you just have to go with your gut and find the right fit.  Which I guess makes sense, since this is a pretty small sliver of the employment universe and how different can these places really be.  One interviewer somewhere along the road in the process told me that what's hardest about finding where people are "happiest" or where "quality of life" is highest, or anything like that is that the people who are unhappy leave and go elsewhere, so most of the people you meet at a firm probably like it there.  No matter where.  And the challenge is to somehow figure out in a 30-minute interview whether they seem like the kind of person that if they like it there, you'd like it there too.  Which is obviously a task for someone with super-human powers.  But those are the kinds of powers they'll expect from us when we start working, anyway.  Another observation about these callback interviews: I feel like having 4 back-to-back interviews becomes sort of like this transformation from nervous and quiet to quite a bit looser by the end.  So the same question gets totally different answers just depending on when in the process it is:  Interviewer 1: "So what kind of law are you looking to practice?" Answer 1: "Probably litigation, I guess.  I really like the idea of having to think persuasively and come up with effective arguments to advance the client's interests."  Interviewer 2: "So what kind of law are you looking to practice?" Answer 2: "Litigation, probably.  I like arguing, persuading people, coming up with effective ways to get the client what he wants, making things happen, winning the case."  Interviewer 3: "So what kind of law are you looking to practice?" Answer 3: "Litigation, almost certainly.  I'm a born litigator.  I love to argue, get down and dirty with another lawyer, get the client what he deserves, persuade a jury that our way is the only way."  Interviewer 4: "So what kind of law are you looking to practice?" Answer 4: "I can't see myself doing anything but litigation.  My middle name is litigatore, which is Latin for litigation.  I love to fight with people, like in a wrestling ring, with jello.  I want to win, win, win, and bring fame and fortune to your clients, your firm, and mostly me.  Because I'm just a fighter that way.  Litigation rocks!"  I'm exaggerating my point.  But you see what I mean.

      I'm now "elsewhere" (as I promised I'd soon be in my post this morning).  And I've now had one callback interview.  And like you might guess, a callback interview is a lot like an on-campus interview, only the windows look out onto something different and the desks are covered with papers.  Actually, that's my most interesting observation -- there's an awful lot of paper on these people's desks.  Piles and piles and piles of paper.  I don't know what any of it was -- maybe the first 437 drafts of a full-length screenplay, I don't know -- but there was an awful lot of it on the four desks of the people I interviewed with.  Even more paper than all the paper lying around the office of the Environmental Law Review at school.  Really!  Anyway, the callback left me with good feelings about the firm and little in the way of actual insightful observation.  I actually came up with what seems like a decent question to ask at these things -- although I didn't actually ask it exactly to any of the interviewers today.  Basically: "So obviously I'm looking at a bunch of firms this week -- you've been through this process before; what do you think I should be looking for this week as I visit these offices that won't necessarily be obvious?"  The only problem with that question is that I expect the answers will all be pretty much the same.  "It's the people.  And here at   we really do have special people.  We all get along, we hang out after work, they're my friends, I enjoy being here.  You're going to work hard anywhere, but what really matters are the people."  And they'd be right, of course... but I get to meet a handful of people, and I'm sure they don't send the monsters to interview... so I feel like it's a good thought in principle, but I'll probably like everyone I meet.  Now if someone were to say, "Look out for large stacks of paper on people's desks..." well, then we'd be getting somewhere.

      I'll soon be posting from elsewhere for ten days or so.  Next week is "fly-out" week, when basically everyone goes to whatever city (or cities) he or she is interviewing in and does callback interviews.  Or, in the case of 3Ls with offers they've accepted or 2Ls not taking part in the process (there are a few...), it's a week-long vacation to wherever.  I know one person going to Hawaii and another to Paris.  I am not.  It is nice that Harvard's schedule allows for this, though -- I hear there are lots and lots of schools that make everyone schedule the interviews around 3-day weekends, or miss classes, or other unpleasant stuff like that (perhaps you're thinking that having to miss class isn't unpleasant... and I suppose that's fair... but still, not having to deal with that is way more convenient).  The Office of Career Services had a session about what callbacks are like last week.  Unfortunately, they held it while on-campus interviews were still going on, and I had an interview.  Also unfortunately (for those that attended), I heard it was useless.  I was going to read up on the OCS web site about callback interviews, and whether callback is one word or there's a dash in the middle, but the password-protected section of Harvard's entire site appears to be down, or my computer is screwy.  Either way, whatever surely-valuable information is there is inaccesible to me.  The only solution?  I've got to write my own.  Bear in mind I've yet to have a callback interview, so this will not be useful to anyone looking for real information.  But what can you do?  JEREMY'S FIFTEEN RULES FOR CALLBACK INTERVIEWS  1. Only go to callbacks to which you have been invited by the firm.  While it may seem tempting to dress up in your favorite suit and go wandering through downtown wherever knocking on the doors of the firms that rejected you and trying to convince them that your name ought to be on the list, in order to spend hours and hours talking to their attorneys, who, in the end will figure out you shouldn't have been there and not give you an offer anyway, you're really just wasting your time and theirs.  Guidebooks that propose this as an appropriate interview strategy most likely were written by the same people who say that to get a high score on the SAT, you should always pick "C."  Everyone knows you should always pick "B."  2. It's probably a bad idea to schedule two callbacks in different cities in the same day.  Or at least at the same time.  Air travel has advanced by leaps and bounds since most of these big law firms were founded back in the days of Christopher Columbus (Did You Know: John Adams worked for 7 of the top 10 Vault-ranked firms in his day.  He kept getting fired for stealing office supplies!).  While you could theoretically interview in New York at 7 AM, be on a plane by noon, get to LA by 2 PM with the time change, interview at 3 PM and be in San Francisco for a late dinner, this strategy is ill-advised.  For some reason.  I can't remember why.  3. When a firm takes you to "lunch," it's not really lunch.  It's a test.  To see if you are bulimic.  Big law firms have recently been in the news for promoting an unhealthy body image among young associates.  Rates of bulimia at corporate law firms have surpassed those at playgrounds, nursing homes, and construction sites.  Given this epidemic, law firms are now screening each candidate at a "lunch" to ensure healthy eating habits and a positive body image.  If you're invited for lunch, DO NOT, under any circumstances, go to the restroom at any point during the meal.  You will be followed.  You will not receive an offer.  Also: gratuitous intake of unhealthy food is encouraged at these meals, to "prove" you're okay with your appetite.  Eat pats of butter, by themselves.  Lick everyone's bread.  Steal food from partners' plates.  Get three desserts.  You'll get an offer, guaranteed!*  *note: the word "guaranteed" is mere puff and is not indicative of any actual guarantee about anything at all.  4. Lawyers LOVE off-color jokes.  Tell a lot of them.  Especially the one about the priest, the rabbi, and the Jehaovah's Witness.  They love that one.  5. All law firms operate on Greenwich Mean Time.  It's a little known fact.  But what this means is that unless your interview is in Greenwich (either England or Connecticut, both are fine), you'll need to set your watch differently.  A 10 AM interview is really at 4 in the afternoon!  I betcha didn't know that!  When you show up 6 hours late, the firm will congratulate you on your sophistication and understanding of complex legal matters like time zones.  Which are indeed very tricky.  A special problem on Monday, after the clocks change this Sunday (see, there IS something useful buried in here -- change your clock on Sunday! And every Sunday!)  6.-13. Some lawyers only have 8 fingers and toes.  Point that out to them.  It demonstrates your sharp legal mind.  And lets me quickly skip through 8 numbers quickly as I realize I'm hungry and won't be able to think of 15 things to write before lunchtime.  14. Urine sample.  Most firms will want a urine sample along with your transcript and three references.  It's very important to avoid going to the bathroom for 48 hours before your interview so that you'll be able to fill the three-gallon jug they will provide.  Anyone unable to fill the jug is automatically rejected, as per NALP guidelines and a recent National Board of Health directive entitled, "Three Gallons is Just About Enough!" (LEXIS, 2003).  15. Jokes about urine (see #14) are especially encouraged.

      There's an interesting post over at  urlLink En Banc  about law review articles, building off of a post over at  urlLink The Volokh Conspiracy .  The post basically replies to a hypothetical professor's question about what to do when top journals reject his or her work, and seeks explanations.    One of the reasons I'm linking to En Banc is that it's a new group law blog, made up of 8 people who've also got weblogs of their own.  As you'll see if you check it out, I'm one of the eight, and mostly just feel pleased to have been asked to take part, and since I basically say no to nothing....  It won't affect anything that happens here (it would be awfully dumb for me to let it, I think) -- En Banc's focused much more on "real" legal issues, and serious stuff like that, stuff that I'd have no context (or inspiration, really) to post normally, but given the group nature of the blog, someone else's posts may occasionally spark something in me, and that gives me a place to respond.  This remains what it is -- that's just some other stuff if I'm so inspired.  It may become more trouble than it's worth, but it may also turn out cool.  I don't know.  Just an experiment.  I was actually thinking about posting anonymously over there, but that really seemed like more trouble than it's worth.  And I'll flag anything good from there over here.    Like this law review discussion, which I thought was interesting enough that I'd link.  My take on legal journals and how they work, at least at Harvard?  My "Law Review Helga" replies to a post by "Law Review Sally" that tells Professor "Seattle" that maybe her article just wasn't good enough and that's why it got rejected by the journals:  "Seattle, don't listen to Sally. I'm sure your article was great. But let's face it. These journals are run by law students. Law students who barely do the reading they have to do for class, let alone the extra reading they volunteer to do so they can add 'submissions committee' to their resumes. The kid who read your article read it in eight minutes while watching South Park, and besides that is just a 2L who's never taken a class in the subject you wrote about and can't tell the difference between a groundbreaking legal article on the topic and a USA Today feature story on how many stars there are on the US flag. So it's not your fault, Seattle. It's the system. If you want to get published by today's youth running these journals (don't ask Law Review Helga her age... but she was Rutherford Hayes' kindergarten teacher, so she's been around a while), you need lewd pictures and four-letter words. That's the ticket, Seattle. Don't lose hope."  In all seriousness, I'm on the "submissions committee" of the journal I'm on here (which really just means I've read an article or three and written up a brief report, thumbs-up or thumbs-down -- I'm sure on the Law Review it's much more intense). And most of the articles I've read, to be honest, are simply beyond my understanding. I don't know that much law, I don't know what's "groundbreaking" in any particular field... I'm just guessing. I'm trying -- but heck if I know what makes an article publishable in a top journal in the field. I mean, I can say if something's readable, clear, well-written... but new and noteworthy? So I don't know that I really understand the student-in-control system... or if in the end it really works, or it doesn't... but yeah, Seattle's article may be junk, but it also may just be it fell into the wrong hands over at the journal.  And actually I just had a 3-hour "mass subcite" tonight, which, even when you're an "article editor" and theoretically "running" the subcite, still isn't all that much fun.  :)

      Re: my post over the weekend about hoping for some new ideas of stuff to write about besides interviews, a reader e-mailed to ask:  "How practical do you think your education is, in terms of actually being a lawyer?... I'm torn.  I feel like much of what I'm learning will make me a better lawyer.  But better than an apprenticeship?  I'm not sure.  I just wondered what your take was, particularly given the stereotype that higher ranked schools aren't the curved competitive mess that the 2nd tiered schools (like mine) are.  Do you feel like you are prepared for the real world?  Do you even know?"  It's a great question, and I wish I had a great answer.  The truth is, though, I really don't know.  I don't really know beyond the basics what lawyers at law firms do, what lawyers not at law firms do, what lawyers in any context besides being a law professor do.  And the knowledge and skills they use and need to perform their jobs well.  I mean, I know they do legal research, and write memos and briefs, and counsel clients, and try to come up with solutions to problems within the context of the applicable legal rules.  Or something like that.  And I guess that's more than I knew before starting law school.  But without actually working at a law firm, I don't know that I have any idea whether law school is good at training us for the work we'll do, or bad at it.  I do think law school does a fine job of teaching us how to think about the various spheres of law we have courses in -- I feel like I understand a lot of the issues in contract law, in property law... that I could recognize when there's a problem, and have some idea what kinds of things I'd need to do in order to get a better handle on it.  Obviously we don't learn the actual legal provisions of state law, or details like that... but we at least get a framework and I feel like we know how to find out a lot of what we need.  In the areas of law I haven't taken a course in, I'm not sure simply being at law school has done all that much except show me there are lots of neat study guides I could probably use, and, of course, Lexis and Westlaw.  But ask me a question about Tax Law, and I'd be pretty stumped.  The one area I do feel like there's probably a bit of a disconnect regards writing -- from everything I know, much of a lawyer's time is spent writing -- persuasive writing, like briefs, or clear and concise memos, carefully drafted documents, etc.  Yet in law school -- at least here -- we take a pass-fail writing class that nobody fails, and we write a couple of memos, and that's it.  Writing out of the way, all done.  The focus is minimal.  Which seems not to be how it goes in the real world.  So the short version of that long-winded paragraph is that I have no idea -- I don't know if I'm prepared for the real world any more than I was before, and whether the training I assume I'll get at whatever place I work will build on what we learn in law school, or be closer to starting from scratch.   And on some level, it doesn't really matter, I don't think -- I'm no more or less prepared than my classmates, and I'm sure the firms have figured out what they need to teach us and what we've learned in school, and we all end up okay in the end.  So the thought that I may not be learning anything useful, bad as it sounds to say, doesn't really worry me as long as I feel like I'm learning about as much as anyone else is and will be starting off at the same baseline.  And I don't know if it's any different here than anywhere else -- I've got no reason to believe the coursework is substantially different -- we use the same casebooks as anywhere else -- and it is competitive here, and there is a curve -- although it is probably a lower-pressure environment than elsewhere just because of the job situation coming out.  But having only been here, I don't know how different it is elsewhere.  Good question.  Deserves a better answer than I've got.  But at least it's not about interviews.  :)

      Henry Kissinger is on The Daily Show right now.  He is not that funny.  He's talking about his new book, which contains transcripts of conversations he had with world leaders during the 1973 Syria-Egypt-Israel conflict and the 1975 Vietnam-US conflict.  Not to take anything away from Dr. Kissinger, but it seems awfully easy to "write" a book that's simply a transcript of his conversations.  Since they were all tape-recorded.  No, obviously this is interesting stuff to people interested in this stuff.  Kobe Bryant is writing a similar book.  [Imagine that right here is a transcript of what a Kobe Bryant conversation would be like.  Whatever you can imagine is probably funnier than whatever I can think of, so I won't even try.]  Don Zimmer is writing a similar book too:  DON ZIMMER: "I don't like that Pedro Martinez guy.  His head's too small." YANKEES PITCHING COACH MEL STOTTLEMYRE: "Look at that, Don.  Everyone's rushing out on to the field." DON ZIMMER: "I think I'll go beat up Pedro.  Here I come!" MEL STOTTLEMYRE: "Be careful, Don." DON ZIMMER: "I hate you, Pedro." PEDRO MARTINEZ: "Your head is so big." DON ZIMMER: "All the better to---" PEDRO MARTINEZ: "Bye, bye, Don." DON ZIMMER: "I'm rolling--- and I can't get up."     P.S. There's an interesting post about the different types of weblogs over  urlLink here  at the Civil Procedure weblog.

      Not to return to a topic I'm ready to leave, but... there's an interesting post on a less-interesting thread on the Princeton Review law school discussion board about Harvard's on-campus-interviewing process.  The thread topic is about how the original poster didn't get as many callbacks as he or she hoped, and blames the school.  Basically.  Which isn't really fair, because if there's one thing Harvard does well, it's bring lots of firms to campus who all want to hire us.  So most of the thread isn't all that useful.  But there's a post by a poster, "Efficient Breach," towards the end of the thread, that talks about Harvard's policy against letting firms pre-screen by looking at our transcripts and instead forcing firms to go through the charade of a twenty-minute interview with someone they'll never hire.  The thread is  urlLink here .  My take on it is pretty middle-of-the-road: if there are really firms that are pre-screening based on grades, and under no circumstances will give jobs to someone with a GPA below [whatever], then it really doesn't seem to make sense to waste their time and students' time by not letting them pre-screen these people beforehand.  But, if it's possible for the firms to be persuaded by an exceptional interview, and override the grade cutoff, even in just a handful of special cases, then I guess I think not letting them pre-screen is okay.  I break no new ground with this position, obviously.  Efficient Breach's post basically says the same thing, but comes down in the direction of assuming these firms do have hard cutoffs, and therefore Harvard is being silly by not letting them pre-screen.  I'm inclined to think that a truly superb interview -- and borderline grades that would perhaps have been screened out if pre-screening was allowed -- might in some cases tip the balance (obviously this is just a guess), even when a firm insists its cutoff is firm, and so I'd probably come out in the direction of keeping the policy as is.  The biggest worry I'd have about letting firms pre-screen (and I imagine this is Harvard's worry too) is that firms that in practice wouldn't have a real cut-off, if given the chance would love to only have to see people in the top half/third/whatever of the class -- and will only interview those students, just because they only have to.  While now, those same firms may very well be hiring people who fall below there.  So the number of firms with "cut-offs" would increase, just because the process would enable them to have them.  Maybe?  EDITED TO ADD (MONDAY 9:45 AM): "Efficient Breach" posted a response on the Princeton Review board  urlLink here .  I agree with EB's argument that if firms truly have "firm bars" then it's just wasting everyone's time for them to have to interview people below that bar.  But EB writes: "Jeremy's hypothesis is that allowing prescreening will move employers from a soft bar to a firm bar. But why?"  Like I said, it's just a guess: but I think more firms would employ cut-offs just because it would be easier for them to do so.  Suppose a firm tends to call back 50% of students above a certain GPA, and 10% of students below a certain GPA, just because it's sufficiently impressed with them, or whatever.  The firm may absolutely believe that the 10% they call back below the line are great candidates -- but given the ability to pre-screen, could decide it's just not worth sending three more interviewers up, and having to wade through the 90% they won't be taking, just to find the 10% -- when they can still get the 50% of above-the-line students they want, and maybe take a few extras to compensate on the numbers, who may have been borderline candidates before.  I don't think that would be an unreasonable thought process necessarily.  So not letting them pre-screen means those 10% get callbacks, but letting them pre-screen would mean they wouldn't even get interviews.  Maybe I'm wrong -- maybe it's so competitive between firms that each firm wants to absolutely interview as many people as possible to find those "10%" gems that may not have the high GPA, or because they know if they pre-screen they may not get enough Harvard students to fill their class -- or whatever other reasons are out there.  But just as a thought exercise, it seems to me it could cut either way, and for some firms (perhaps the very top firms, who aren't worried that losing my hypothetical "10%" will really impact the overall Harvard yield) it would go the way of closing a door that for a few students would have otherwise been open.  (Also, thanks to EB for the kind words about my weblog at the top of his response... appreciated, really.)

      Anyone got any questions / thoughts / comments about law school / about anything?  One of my friends who's not a law student e-mailed me and said, in part:  "I've just been reading your weblog some for the first time in a while... I think it's really funny how it seems from the weblog that all you do is go to interviews and think about interviewing... it's just funny picturing you sitting in interviews and waiting in interviews... so much that you're compelled to make fun of interviews in every possible way and in every possible comedic format you can think up."  He's right.  I need new inspiration besides these interviews.  It's overkill.  But because (a) classes are the same as they've been and there's nothing much new to say about them, (b) extracurricular activities are the same as they've been and there's nothing much new to say about them, and (c) I have nothing useful or amusing to say about Iraq, interviews are the "new thing" that I feel compelled to post about.  But if I have to write one more "Top Ten Tie Patterns Interviewers Wear... (1) stripes; (2) checks; (3) dollar signs; (4) skull and crossbones; (5) horns and pitchforks; (6) nuclear bomb mushroom clouds; (7) gravestones; (8) brimstone and fire; (9) mini-Saddam Hussein pictures; (10) Kenny from South Park," I don't think I'm justifying my existence.  So if anyone wants to see other stuff, I'm at your mercy.  E-mail.  PLUS: Check out this  urlLink NY Times article  about a Mailboxes Etc. employee-by-day, rock-musician-by-night that's pretty interesting.  AND: I read something a few days ago about how the government is spending millions and millions of dollars on advertisements for the new $20 bill.  They're spending money to advertise... money.  As if they're competing with Canadian currency and wampum and need to increase market share.  "I don't know, Bob.  They're not spending money like they used to.  I saw someone using beads in the local 7-11.  I think we need to advertise more."  "Yes, John, I think you're right.  Let's spend millions of dollars to let people know how cool money is, and all the things you can do with it."  "I have a great slogan. Bob.  'Money.  It's everywhere you want to be.'"  "I think VISA took that one already."  "Oh, yeah, you're right."  "How about this one? 'The touch, the feel, of money.  The fabric of our lives.'"  "No, that's cotton."  "Oh, whoops."  "This is hard.  Good thing we have so much money to spend."  "We can't spend all of it.  We need to save one $20 bill to actually appear in the commercial."  "Oh yeah, you're right."  "Let's go to lunch."  "Okay."

      Dear Interviewer Dude,  The Office of Career Services tells us its unnecessary for us to write thank you notes after our on-campus interviews, but I wanted to send you a note anyway, to tell you how much I enjoyed our meeting last week and how much I look forward to getting to know more about your firm should I be invited to come and visit the office.  I wanted to thank you first for making me wait in the hallway for forty-two minutes while you beat the interview hotels room service attendant with your stylish yet functional leather belt.  Also, I wanted to thank you for tearing up my transcript into little bits when I handed it to you.  I was waiting for an interviewer to do that.  Thank you for getting up in the middle of the interview to relieve yourself on the carpet.  Thank you for taking a cell phone call in the middle of the interview from your sister with the bumpy rash.  Yes, your speaker volume was that high.  Thank you for insulting my mom.  Thank you for kicking me under the table.  Repeatedly.  Thank you for smelling like cheese.  Thank you for licking me when I went to shake your hand.  Thank you for inviting me to use the bathroom and then locking me inside for half an hour.  Thank you for stabbing me with a plastic fork.  Thank you for making me sit through a screening of Gigli before you would let me leave at the end of the interview.  Thank you for removing my left kidney using only the instruments in the hotel sewing kit.  I only need one kidney.  But, most of all, thank you in advance for the callback invitation.  I look forward to seeing you again soon.  Thanks, Grateful Student    Dear Grateful Student,  	I very much enjoyed meeting with you last week when I was on campus.  I especially enjoyed your responses to the following questions:  1. When I asked you why you chose to interview with us, and you responded that you chose exclusively on the basis of the number of syllables in a firms name, and since we had fourteen, we made it to your list  but just barely.  On my flight home that night, however, I realized that you had miscounted.  We only have thirteen syllables.  Errors like that are not well-tolerated at the firm.  2. When I asked you what kind of law you were most interested in, and you responded Lobster, and then when I expressed confusion, you answered that you thought Id asked what kind of *claw* you were most interested in, not law.  3. When I asked you to explain your Torts grade, and you pretended you no longer spoke English.  4. When I asked you what you had enjoyed the most about your experience working in the potato chip factory, and you said the day my co-workers arm got sliced off by the automatic slicer, because that was the day you got an extra ten-minute break while they cleaned it up.  I did not believe your story until later that evening, when I purchased a bag of potato chips and found an arm inside.  5. When I asked you if you were on law review, and you said no.  The answers you gave to those questions unfortunately have led us to the unfortunate decision that we will be unable to offer you a callback this interview season.  However, with your impressive credentials and bright green teeth, I am certain that you will find success in the rest of the interviewing process, and in all of your future pursuits.  With deep and genuine sorrow and unfortunance, Interviewer Dude

      HLS 1L TJ writes at  urlLink Undeniable Dilemma  about taking on some extracurricular activities:  "Naturally, I'm kinda nervous about devoting enough time [to] class work... if 'enough' is actually attainable. But then again, not that nervous. These are the reasons I came to law school. It'd be terrible for me to forego such pursuits out of fear of getting behind a few days of reading. I think."  I'm just linking because I think he's totally got the right idea.  The people I know who don't so much like it here tend to be the ones who don't do all that much outside of class.  Just to be around people, to be doing things that aren't about the classes, to be spending time in places other than the library, to have pursuits that don't involve a final exam, to fill days with things other than the cases in your casebooks... I think one of the best things about being a student -- anywhere, studying anything -- is that there are these extracurricular activities, and organized ways to get involved in doing stuff.  Does anyone leave school wishing they'd read more?  Of course do work.  But of course do other stuff too.  I'm repeating myself from past posts.  But just wanted to link to TJ for another voice on the matter.

      I know I'm just turning a non-issue into another post for no good reason, but Katie Biber over at  urlLink Ex Parte , the HLS Federalist Society blog, responds to my response to Patrick from Ex Parte's comment about my comment re: the HLS GOP sponsoring the blood drive.  She writes:  "Actually, the HLS GOP blood drive is not like the Environmental Law Society sponsoring a conference on diversity. It's like the Environmental Law Society, BLSA, the Squash Club, or the Ballroom Dancing Society adopting a family for Thanksgiving or volunteering at a soup kitchen. What creates the ridiculous impression that conservatives don't "have a lot to do with" community service? ... I am frustrated when other people consistently express surprise at the generosity and community spirit shown by our campus conservative and libertarian groups."  I think Katie is great, and, like I said, this is really a non-issue I'm writing about for lack of anything else to say -- but I don't know that I see her smaller point (I'll get to her larger point in a moment).  I don't see her examples -- The Squash Club volunteering at a soup kitchen, or the Ballroom Dancing Society adopting a family for Thanksgiving -- as substantially different from my example of the Environmental Law Society sponsoring a conference on diversity.  If people wanted to volunteer at a soup kitchen, they wouldn't join the squash club to do it.  Not that there's anything wrong with these organizations doing whatever they want to do -- which is why it's a non-issue.  It's fine that the GOP sponsored a blood drive.  I just thought it was funny.  And (here's the larger point) it's not I think conservatives are anti-community service or generosity.  Heck, if anything, the conservative social solution -- people (and private charities) helping people -- fits that model more than the liberal social solution -- government helping people.  Gross generalizations, I know.  But I say it to show I don't at all think that being a conservative makes someone less inclined to have community spirit.  I just didn't realize that the collection of blood was on the conservative agenda.  It's not a political position -- I think we all support the concept of blood drives, regardless of political affiliation.  Hence it surprised me to see a politically-aligned group sponsoring it.  That's all I meant.  Really.

      The Red Sox didn't get a callback this week.  The Yankees, baseball's equivalent of the editor-in-chief of the Law Review, got it instead.  The Marlins, who clerked for a Supreme Court justice six years ago, but then turned to drugs and inferior outlines for years until making a surprise comeback and winning the Ames Competition this year, will battle the Yankees for the ultimate prize: an offer from Wachtell.  The Cubs will work at a small firm in Raleigh.  The A's, Twins, Braves, and Cardinals are doing public interest work.  The Mets collect the trash.  The Tigers are floating in a river somewhere.  Red Sox manager Grady Little is Robert Bork: so close to the pinnacle but ultimately falling short.  Marlins manager Jack McKeon is John Paul Stevens: really, really old.  Don Zimmer is George W. Bush: not so bright.  The fan who caught the ball in Wrigley Field that prevented Moises Alou from catching it and getting the Cubs to the World Series is Gray Davis.  Pedro Martinez is Howard Dean: strong for a while, but fading in the home stretch.  Aaron Boone is Wesley Clark: from out of nowhere... and surely to be eclipsed once again as soon as Jason Giambi hits a gazillion home runs in the World Series.  Jeff Weaver is Joe Lieberman: is he still around?  The Fox announcers said that Weaver hadn't even warmed up all series.  Isn't that sad? I feel bad for Jeff Weaver.  Even though he's earning millions of dollars and will probably end up with a World Series ring.

      I'm done with my on-campus interviews.  Time to launder my dress shirt.  Kidding.  Well, sort of.  If there's one good thing about interviews, it's that I now have a "lucky interview tie," a "lucky interview shirt," and "lucky interview socks."  Unfortunately, they're the same as my "unlucky interview tie," "unlucky interview shirt," and "unlucky interview socks."  Given that each interview is only 20 minutes long, and I change into and out of my suit and dress shirt and shoes and all that stuff pretty closely before and after each interview (finally making use of my locker!), I've probably worn the stuff for only about the equivalent of a day or two in the whole three-week process.  This, in my mind, more than justifies that I've only washed the shirt twice, and tried to alternate two pairs of socks, handwashing them in the sink on their "off days."  And one pair of boxers.  No, I'm kidding on that last one.  Really, I swear.  Of course ties hold up pretty well -- and once I found that one was working, I didn't bother alternating.  Today I forgot my "interview watch" for the first time though.  My "expensive" $60 metal Swatch (I save it for "special" occasions) instead of the free (literally, it was free) watch I got when I bought a polo shirt a few years ago (not actually a Ralph Lauren Polo shirt of course -- again, too expensive for me and my $6 "dress" belt).  I learned something today that completely hadn't crossed my mind at all -- first some background: people with multiple callback offers usually choose one firm through which to book their travel arrangements, and then that firm gets reimbursed from the other firms.  So each firm has a hotel it tends to book people in, I guess.  So some people with more than one callback apparently try to find out the hotels each firm uses and they pick which firm to book through based on the hotel.  Which I guess makes sense.  But completely hadn't crossed my mind at all.  Not that it really matters all that much -- no firm is putting people up in a shack on the side of the highway.  At least I don't think so.  Maybe the firms that aren't Vault top-50.  I'm kidding.  I don't know what the Vault rankings mean, by the way.  I see no methodology, no explanation -- and all the firm descriptions read like our course guide -- this firm is "laid-back" but "intense," "nice people" who "scream a lot," "interesting" work that is sometimes "boring," "nice food" if you like "bad food," "no weekends," except "on Saturdays and Sundays."

      Patrick Lewis over at  urlLink Ex Parte , the HLS Federalist Society weblog, writes, of a post of mine from a couple of weeks ago:  "Jeremy Blachman wonders why HLS GOP sponsored the law school blood drive. Since we know it isn't possible for Republicans to believe in good will toward men or charitable activities, the reason must be that Republicans are blood sucking vampires."  Re-reading my post, I admit it wasn't clear what exactly I was implying -- but really the observation I wanted to make was why *any* political-minded organization -- right, left, or whatever direction anyone else is -- would be sponsoring the Blood Drive.  Like if the Environmental Law Society sponsored a conference on diversity.  It's not a *bad* thing of course; it just doesn't seem to have a heck of a lot to do with what they do.  But I suppose it could have been read in a bad way, so I've got no problem with the comment -- just thought I'd clarify.

      A NY Times article about people who buy new techno-gadgets and end up throwing them into a closet never to be seen again,  urlLink here .  I don't own any of the gadgets they mention in the article, except for the CD burner that came with my computer.  I'm sort of a technophobe.  I don't need a webcam, a GPS device, or a universal remote control.  But the article's interesting anyway.

      "Sorry to keep you waiting.  Have a seat.  How's interviewing going?"  "Pretty rough.  No one seems to like me."  "Oh.  Maybe this one will be different."  "Probably not."  "So, why did you choose to interview with this firm?"  "I knew I wanted to work in this particular city, or at least one of the cities near it, and I talked to a lot of people, and no one had anything bad to say about you."  "Great.  Do you have any idea what kind of law you want to practice?"  "Yes.  [X]."  "We don't do that here."  "But it says on your website--"  "We don't do that."  "Oh."  "I was looking at your resume--"  "Uh oh."  "--and I noticed you do a bunch of volunteer work.  That's great.  Must be hard to balance with the law school workload."  "Not really.  I don't really do all that much.  I didn't lie or anything, but maybe kind of exaggerated on the resume."  "Oh.  Then tell me about what you did last summer."  "I didn't do all that much."  "No law firm job?"  "Couldn't get one.  Tried really hard.  No one would hire me."  "Any idea why?"  "Probably they called my references."  "Oh.  Do you have a copy of those?"  "Sure."  "And a transcript?"  "Yeah.  But before you look at that, I just want to let you know I'm really not as stupid as it seems."  "Is that right?"  "All of my professors misgraded my exams.  Every grade on there should be higher.  I should also be on law review but they misplaced my competition.  And actually I'd be a multi-millionaire but I chose the wrong lottery numbers."  "Have you got a writing sample?"  "In English?"  "Yes, if you've got one."  "No, not in English."  "What language is it in?"  "I'm not sure.  The website I got it from didn't say."  "Oh.  Any questions about the firm."  "Nope."  "Excellent.  Nice to meet you.  We'll let you know."  [end]

      In one of my classes, we're on "panel" one day during the semester.  Which means that's the day we get called on, and all the rest of the days we're free to just listen.  My day is tomorrow.  Today, one of the four people on panel wasn't there.  I have no idea if there were consequences.  Regardless, this panel system, while nice on every day besides the one you're on panel, seems sort of ineffective in getting people to actively do the reading each day and prepare for class.  But I guess in a class of over 150 students, what else can they do.  Time to read.

      Still interviews.  There's two main sites for interviews here, The Charles Hotel, and The Inn At Harvard.  All of mine have been at the Charles.  Until today.  When I had one at the Inn.  You might be thinking that would make for an exciting change of pace.  It didn't.  Still playoffs.  Don Zimmer bobblehead dolls should be tomorrow's promotion.  Ha.  Seriously, it's not like I think Pedro Martinez is a real nice guy, but it was pretty silly for Mr. Zimmer to be running out of the dugout trying to fight him.  Not that I think he deserved to be thrown to the ground, but he kind of brought it upon himself.  Silly man.  Lucky man, in that he didn't get himself really injured.  It's amazing how much time one can waste clicking around on Friendster trying to see if anyone you still keep in touch with keeps in touch with anyone who keeps in touch with anyone who you maybe wish you'd kept in touch with or at least are curious to see if they have a recent photo up.  I'm barely on Friendster -- 3 friends have separately "invited" me, and so I signed up and accepted their invites, but it's just those three.  I don't really see the complete point of it.  But I don't want to let the whole thing pass me by.  Kind of like why I vote.  Not really.  That's a bad and borderline nonsensical metaphor. Sorry.  Ten Places Law Firms Do Not Conduct Interviews  1. Janitor's Closet 2. Inside big vat in which cafeteria cooks soup   3. In the Jewish students association's Sukkah 4. Piano practice room while piano player is practicing 5. Medical center exam room #3 6. Large Pothole on Massachusetts Avenue 7. Inside big electron-spewing laser thing in Science Center 8. Right near big electron-spewing laser thing in Science Center, while it's on and emitting all sorts of nasty stuff 9. On sloped roof of a tall building 10. The second stall from the left

      I saw "School of Rock" yesterday, the Jack Black movie about teaching a bunch of kids to be rock stars.  I give it an 82 out of 100 on another fairly random scale that means very little to anyone who doesn't live inside my head.  It was entertaining and mostly amusing; the negatives were that the plot was wholly unbelievable and required the viewer to suspend all logic of how schools operate and how people really behave; and also that all of the characters besides Jack Black's (and even his, to a degree) were one-dimensional stereotypes.  It could have been much much worse; Jack Black did a nice job, they cast the kids well, the actors in the one-dimensional roles did as much as they could... but I think it also could have been considerably better had they reined in the situations that required the most leaps of faith and kept things feeling a little more real... then it possibly could have had a point, or some broader meaning, instead of just being a relatively entertaining 108 minutes without much depth.  I don't particularly like Jack Black or think he's all that special, and still liked the movie -- so that's a good thing I guess.  The concept's strong -- this movie written by Albert Brooks could have been a real gem; as it is, like I said, it's not bad, and it is often laugh-worthy... but it wasn't all that it could have been.  Just my opinion.  Reviewers seem to be loving this, so what do I know.

      The polished version of the ramblings below.  "Vanishing Act"  I could tolerate the cafeteria last year; but this year I dont know what happened.  One of my friends said something like that over dinner (not in the cafeteria, thankfully) a few nights ago.  And while it would give me a great excuse to write about the Hark and how Id rather Dean Kagans build a new shiny bathroom funds had gone to get some better food, thats not what it made me think about.  What happened to my cafeteria-hatin friend, to me, and to our 550-odd classmates is that we became 2Ls.  And being a 2L, compared with being a 1L, just isnt the same.  There are the obvious technical differences: we know where all the buildings are and the shortcuts for getting there, we know how to find old outlines, we know that until this year the coffee wasnt always free and that there werent always tampons in the womens bathrooms (actually, I dont really know that firsthand  but I take everyones word for it).  We know that "mandatory meetings" arent really mandatory and that skimming that last chapter of reading doesnt make you a bad person.  Weve lost that feeling that sometimes hit in the back of the head that told us perhaps we ought to be outlining, forming a study group, briefing cases, stalking professors at their office hours, buying study guides, highlighting with more colors (side note: one firm I interviewed with gave out an awesomely-cool erasable highlighter.  One side is pink, the other side is white  when you rub the white side over the pink youve used, it vanishes.  This is almost as revolutionary as the combination tampon-highlighter theyll be giving out in the womens bathrooms come exam time.  Twenty minutes of amazement in the library before I could actually bring myself to stop erasing my highlights, leave the stuff highlighted, and turn the page.  Ive had the thing for twenty-four hours and its already out of ink.  I highlighted my entire TV Guide.) or (is this really still the same sentence?) calling our friends at other law schools to get them to search for our visiting professors old exams.  Not that we did any of that stuff.  But at least we wondered if we ought to be.  This year, no more.  I know people who havent opened their books yet  who havent bought their books yet.  I know people not on the seating chart.  I know people who dont remember what classes theyre in.  But more than that, theres an intensity change between 1L year and 2L year.  Last year, everything felt important, like it had stakes, like it had meaning, like it was real.  Ive got to do a journal, Ive got to send out resumes, Ive got to go to this meeting, Ive got to work on my memo, Ive got to brush my teeth twice a day.  It was easy to care about stuff, because everyone cared, and because the institutional culture told us to care.  This year, its harder.  We know that missing a meeting isnt criminal; that you can be on the executive board of XYZ club basically just by showing up, that the free food opportunities arent going anywhere.  Everyone passes his classes.  Everyone gets a job.  Everyone survives.  Theres not that I could fall off this cliff feeling of danger.  Our professors arent white tigers in a Vegas stage show.  And while thats comforting and stress-un-inducing, it does make 2L life a little less interesting.   And so weve lost the intensity  and at the same time, in some ways weve lost our community.  Our section, the same people in every class, the same experiences-in-common to talk about over crappy food at the cafeteria.  Weve all made friends, but its easier for days to elapse without seeing them, harder to find time-in-common, easier to go to class, go home, and check out.  Of course, part of this is the interviews.  They take up time, they take up energy, they take our pure souls and turn them into stone.  In some ways, the interviews have been cool though, because theyve helped to restore that missing sense of community, just a little bit.  [this section will look familiar to people who read what I wrote yesterday... but it's funny, so I'm using it again.  Ha!]  I pass you in a suit, we share a mutual glance.  I know exactly what youre doing.  In fact, there are people  some I know, some I don't  who've become  maybe just in my own head  sort of my interview comrades, apparently with the same class schedule as me (so that our interviews are at the same times) and with similar firm choices. I see them in the hospitality suites (you again?), in the hallways knocking, coming as I'm going, going as I'm coming, coming as I'm coming, and going as I'm going. There's glasses dude, scoop neck shirt girl, and green resume folder man, just to name a few.  Parts-hair-on-the-left guy, pretty earrings girl, four-fingered fellow, needs-some-Botox lady, always-looks-like-he-has-to-pee man, is-she-pregnant? woman, needs-a-shave dude, needs-a-shave ?girl?, looks-like-my-aunt guy, smells-like-peanut-butter madam, one-shoe-untied man, flabby-elbows girl, spinach-teeth guy, walks-like-a-robot lady, and picks-up-crumbs-from-the-floor-and-eats-them dude.  Just to name a few more.  But once interviews are done, this community too will vanish.  Like the 2Ls from the cafeteria.  And like the pink highlighting, once I use the special magic side of the highlighter that makes it all disappear.  I really like that highlighter.  I hope I get a callback.

      I'm working on an idea here that I hope to turn into something coherent enough for 600 words in The Harvard Law Record next week.  The differences between being a 1L and being a 2L.  At this point in the year, only just over a month in, a lot of the difference is shaped by interviews, I think... but that's still relevant.    The biggest plus about 2L year so far is possibly the added experience and perspective -- doing the reading takes less time, skimming the reading isn't a calamity, no back-of-the-head feeling that perhaps I ought to be outlining, in a study group, briefing cases, buying study guides, stalking professors at office hours, etc., no noticeable competition between classmates (not that I really noticed all that much last year), and having last year figured out what activities I liked and didn't as much like being part of, there's more time spent on things for a reason instead of just because everyone else is doing them.  Sort of.  But the flipside of the positives of being a 2L are the negatives -- the lack of urgency and importance to everything I'm doing... I know the world will not collapse if I were to skip a class or skip a reading, or say something dumb if I'm called on; even "mandatory" meetings of anything don't feel mandatory, getting to higher levels of responsibility in some extracurriculars has illustrated to me that a lot of the activities that seemed "real" as a 1L are really just held together by threads of 2Ls and 3Ls -- not that they aren't "real" but that there's not as much of a framework and an infrastructure and as many people involved as there might have seemed.  That point isn't real clear except in my head, I know.  So nothing feels as important, and it's easy to sort of float through the week not having to care about enough or having to invest oneself in all that much.  Which is a little sad and frustrating.  The other big thing that's mostly a relative negative of being a 2L is the somewhat weaker sense of community, of the built-in social network of having a section, of the same people in every class, of lots of opportunities to interact with people.  It's easier as a 2L to go to class and go home and talk to nobody.  Or not that it's easier to do that, but that it's harder to avoid doing that, harder to encounter people for more than a passing hello, harder to find time in common, easier to avoid seeing people.  Which is countered to some degree by meeting new people in 2L classes and in activities, and meeting 1Ls and 3Ls -- though 1Ls are meeting other 1Ls and don't need to meet 2Ls and 3Ls... and part of this is interviews taking people's time and energy... but it does kind of feel like as a 2L there's less of a community feeling and more effort needs to be taken to do stuff.  Countered by extracurriculars that we're actually involved in taking more time because we have positions of more involvement -- so I feel like I see lots of people all the time, but a lot of it is sort of half-social half-purposeful extracurricular oriented, so it's not quite the same as just hanging out with someone.  Apologies that this is mostly just unstructured rambling thoughts masquerading as something with a point.  Hopefully by tonight, above this you'll find my 600-word masterpiece of a newspaper column built somehow around this topic (because I can't write about interviews AGAIN).  For now you get the brainstorming session.

      Bought a copy of the soundtrack to Avenue Q, the Broadway show that loyal readers will recall I wanted to see over the summer but the "cheap tickets" they lottery off before each show are really limited and I ended up deciding not to pay $91.25 for two hours of entertainment.  Anyway, the soundtrack, which, if you want to pay $2.50 less than I did at Tower Records, but pay for shipping instead and wait a bunch of days to get it, can be found on Amazon  urlLink here .    I give the soundtrack 3 stars out of 4, on a random scale I'm just inventing right now that means nothing.  The songs are nicely melodic for current Broadway -- actually hummable in a bunch of cases, which is nice.  Most are uptempo trying to be funny, and some even succeed.  In a bunch of cases, the titles / concepts are pretty funny and executed nicely -- "Everyone's A Little Bit Racist," "Schadenfreude," "I Wish I Could Go Back To College" -- and in bunch of cases the titles / concepts are pretty funny but it's one joke and executed predictably without much oomph -- "The Internet Is For Porn," "I'm Not Wearing Underwear Today," "You Can Be As Loud As The Hell You Want (When You're Makin' Love)," "My Girlfriend, Who Lives In Canada."  The rest of the songs are a mix of not-that-funny plot filler ("The Money Song"), and pretty solid ballads / "meaning" songs ("There's A Fine, Fine Line," "Purpose," "Mix Tape").  My favorite song on the CD is possibly "What Do You Do With a B.A. in English," except it's too short, and so it probably means they ran out of funny stuff to say.  So I like overall.  Recommended if after reading enough of my weblog you think that if I like something you probably will too.  :)

      This straddles the line between real and funny.  I'm not exactly sure what I'm trying to accomplish here.  Basically, I decided to try and write a song about interviewing.  But it didn't really come out funny.  It's not serious though.  And it's not profound, or sarcastic, or insightful, or witty.  It just is.  It has a melody too, but that's harder to post.  I dunno.  It's just somewhere in that middle ground.  Like reality TV.  I can sing a love song, dance a dance Make you like me if you give me a chance I can tell you stories, make you smile I can show you how I'd be at trial  I can write a memo, work all night Search through papers dark till light I can forgo sleep for work no play Talk about what's on my resume  Twenty minutes to show you Twenty minutes to know you Twenty minutes to be Something making you see That you want to know more  Twenty minutes to floor you Or twenty minutes to bore you Twenty minutes to spend Until the time has to end And I walk out the door  I can share my passion, let you see The gears that turn deep inside me Or I can sit there airtight-lipped As you just look at my transcript  Twenty minutes to show you Twenty minutes to know you Twenty minutes to be Something making you see That you want to know more  Twenty minutes to wow you So twenty minutes from now you Put my name on a list And then try to insist Then I come and see more.

      Three weeks is too long for interviewing.  Back and forth, from one firm to another, twenty-minute slots that with the dressing up and the walk to-and-from become more like an hour, and with the sitting by the phone praying for it to ring become more like twenty-four or forty-eight hours.  Or seventy-two if there's a weekend.  There are people -- some I know, some I don't -- who've become my "interview comrades," apparently with the same class schedule as me (so that our interviews are at the same times) and similar firm choices.  I see them in the hospitality suites ("you again?"), in the hallways knocking, coming as I'm going, going as I'm coming, coming as I'm coming, and going as I'm going.  There's glasses dude, scoop neck shirt girl, and green resume folder man, just to name a few*.  And there are some friends I haven't seen in two weeks because they're interviewing for other firms, at other times, and the only mutual free time we'd have would be Sunday morning at six.  There's the "you're in a suit / I'm not" pass-you-on-campus etiquette, which is to smile and wish good luck.  There's the "both in a suit" etiquette of asking where each other is interviewing, even though we don't really care.  There's the "neither in a suit" most-common question: "No interviews today?"  And the inevitable answer, "No, they're later tonight.  I have nine today."  But back to my thesis statement.  Three weeks is too long.  The first couple of days were new and interesting, but quickly it got pretty routine and tiresome.  By the beginning of week two it was old hat, and now at the end of week two, I'm really ready for it to be done.  It's nothing against the firms; it's the process.  These interviews are all the same, not that interesting, and are making life kind of irritating.  Everyone's always busy, no one has time to do social stuff, meals are afterthoughts, I have to worry that I'm going to spill something on my expensive suit, and my feet don't like my dress shoes.  I'm not complaining, because of course I recognize how lucky I am to be at a school where all these people potentially want me to work for them, or at least are open to taking twenty minutes to consider the idea -- but I'd rather be run ragged in a 3-day 25-interview marathon than have it spread out over all this time.  If I was reforming the system?  We'd do a Wacky Wacky Weekend: no classes Friday; all firms fly in and we do interview slots morning until night on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.  We get everyone scheduled in, three days and we're done.  Results in 48 hours, callbacks the following week, let's get this process over with.  And we could get back to our normal happy lives that don't involve washing our clothes.  *Just to name a few more: parts-hair-on-the-left guy, pretty earrings girl, four-fingered fellow, needs-some-Botox lady, always-looks-like-he-has-to-pee man, is-she-pregnant? woman, needs-a-shave dude, needs-a-shave ?girl?, looks-like-my-aunt guy, smells-like-peanut-butter madam, one-shoe-untied man, flabby-elbows girl, spinach-teeth guy, walks-like-a-robot lady, and picks-up-crumbs-from-the-floor-and-eats-them dude.

      I was hoping to piggyback on something someone else has written on his or her weblog today, something I disagreed with and could comment on, or agreed with and could comment on... but nothing.  So I have no choice but to resort to more haikus.  HAIKUS ABOUT INTERVIEWS  Did he hear my knock? It's been almost four minutes Should I knock again?  Bio on the door Let me read it carefully The door opens.  Ow.  Here is my transcript No, don't look at it like that Should I just leave now?  Not this one again My thirty-second soundbite I repeat once more  The hallway's too hot I don't want to perspire For once, there's no snow  Do I have questions? It's not like I had answers How 'bout I just go?  My resume's creased That means someone has read it Or just creased it.  Oops.  Glasses or lose them? A larger sample size and I could answer that  Don't sit till he does But what if he never sits? That is the question

      Fifteen words and phrases I think it would be cool to somehow drop into an interview in a completely sensible context:  1. Underwear 2. Lions and Tigers and Bears, oh my! 3. Phat 4. Ricki Lake 5. Sexually transmitted disease 6. Armageddon 7. Garfield the cat 8. Lady Macbeth 9. SEC investigation 10. Hemorrhoids 11. Dennis Kucinich for President 12. Grand Theft Auto 13. Temptation Island 14. Phlegm 15. Crossing Over with John Edward

No comment on why the Republicans are sponsoring the blood drive.   Also no comment on the new governor of California.

      I suppose it's back to more interview stuff today, having provided the baseball interlude (see below) last night.  Here's a kind-of-silly song parody -- just a chorus for now -- about the food and drink they give away at the "hospitality suites" before each interview.  "Do You Know The Way To Cookie Tray?" (to the tune of "Do You Know The Way To San Jose?")  Do you know the way to cookie tray? Classmates in suits all block the view that way. Chocolate-covered pretzels also good Though I had some before, I'll have some more.

      I apologize for the fixation on the interview process.  You'd think there's nothing else going on.  I'm sure many of you don't want to keep reading interview humor day after day after day.  I owe you something different, something completely different.  My initial inclination was to talk about stuff we're doing in class.  In Con Law we're talking about obscenity.  But I'm worried that making a "10 things that are definitely obscene" list will not be in good taste.  In Bankruptcy we're talking about discharge.  Which, actually, is on my top 10 list of things that are definitely obscene.  But aside from that is generally uninteresting.  In my third course I forget what we're talking about.  Bottom of the 9th, A's-Red Sox as I type this.  I'm rooting for the A's, making me the only person in the Boston area not rooting for the Red Sox.  I like the A's.  I had Tim Hudson on 6 of my 7 fantasy baseball teams.  Although a Cubs-Red Sox "someone's breaking a long streak" world series would be pretty awesome.  OK, that convinces me.  Go Red Sox.  Sort of.  I'm rooting for extra innings.  I want to see more game.  Extra innings are cool.  OK, but what to write about.  How's about a live diary of the bottom of the 9th inning of this game, hoping for a run to score so we go to extras.  I'll try to be funny.  No promises.  Batter 1: Scott Hatteberg.  He walks.  But really he ran.  And the pinch-runner they put in, Eric Byrnes, ran too.  It shouldn't be called a walk if they're gonna run.  But I guess they can't call it a run.  Because that's already taken.  Batter 2: Jose Guillen.  The announcers are talking about whether Byrnes will steal second.  That would be a pretty dumb risk to take 3 hours away from going home.  Ball 1 to Guillen.  Here comes the pitching coach, Dave Wallace.  The announcers are filling time.  Red Sox last won the world series in 1918, beating the Cubs.  If Eric Byrnes gets picked off, he should be publicly flogged.  Ball 2.  Those fans are loud.  It must suck to make the last out in a playoff series.  Worse than getting called on in class and not knowing the answer.  Duh.  Ball 3.  Oh please be exciting.  Please please please.  If there's a double play I'm going to be sad.  No double play.  No double play.  3-1.  3-2.  Full count.  Bad swing on that one.  Don't get picked off, Eric Byrnes.  "Anxious.  Is that a word to describe the fans... said the announcer.  Yes, it is.  It is a word.  Foul ball.  Still 3-2.  Shaky cameraman needs to take his pills.  Ball 4.  Yippee.  Excitement builds.  Bye, bye pitcher Scott Williamson.  Derek Lowe coming in.  Closer-turned-starter.  Oh, I like Derek Lowe.  He was on my fantasy team last year, when he was super.  I guess with 7 fantasy teams pretty much everyone either is or was once on my fantasy team though.  It makes rooting hard when I want every player, hitter and pitcher, to do well.  I bet he's nervous.  A triple play here would be super-cool.  Would almost make up for no extra innings.  Batter 3: Ramon Hernandez.  Will he bunt?  I don't think so.  I'm first-guessing here.  Trust me, I won't go back and rewrite this after he bunts home the tying run.  From second base.  That would be hard to do.  Announcers like the word "ironic."  They don't use it so well.  Hernandez was once on my fantasy team.  I'm sure someone on this field wasn't.  But I haven't found him yet.  Byrnes was.  Guillen was.  Bill Mueller at 3rd was not.  I was wrong.  He bunted.  2nd and 3rd, 1 out.  A sacrifice fly ties the game.  Batter 4: Adam Melhuse.  I'm surprised they're not intentionally walking him.  Although the Mets lost a series in '99 I think when they walked the bases loaded in a tie game and Kenny Rogers walked in the winning run. 2-2.  Don't strike out.  Don't strike out.  Don't strike out.  Strike three.  Man, that was just what the Red Sox needed.  One out away.  The Boston infield is having a party on the mound.   Maybe they want to teleconference someone else in, since not enough people are out there.  Batter 5: Chris Singleton.  If he wins this game with a single, those headlines are already written.  "Singleton's Single worth a Ton;"  "Single by Singleton!"  etc.  2-1.  Lowe is a low-ball pitcher.  Singleton needs a single.  And the Red Sox wear red socks.  Foul ball. Inches from the game being over.  2-2.  "Bill Buckner anyone?" the announcer said.  I bet Bill Buckner would give his right arm for someone to make that same error he did and so he would no longer have to deal with it.  3-2.  Full count again.  "Singleton, after making last out, is divorced by wife and is Single."  That would be a tortured headline, I guess.  Ball 4.  Loaded bases.  Wow.  Red Sox manager Grady Little is a Little Gray.  And worried.  Batter 6: Terrence Long.  He used to be a Met, a long time ago.  But was never on my fantasy team.  Long is really not all that good.  But I hope he does something here.  Strike one.  Uh oh.  Ball one.   Foul.  One strike away.  Uh oh.  Wow.  Strike three called.  Game over.  That Red Sox-Yankees series coming up Wednesday is going to be a fun one.  Apologies this really isn't that funny.

      Law Students: Too busy with on-campus interviews to e-mail your friends?  Try this quick-and-easy on-campus-interview update-your-friends e-mail template.  Just fill in the blanks with your choice from the bracketed words.  Hi [Friend]!  Busy with on-campus interviewing, but just wanted to drop you a note to say hello and update you on how things are going.  Basically, interviews are going [excellently / dismally / almost suicidally].  By that I mean that I've had [8 / 13 / 76] interviews so far, and received [8 / 1 / zero] callbacks.  And my first-choice firm [loved me / kicked me out of the hotel room / shot me in the arm -- hence the difficulty with e-mail the last few days!].  My funniest interview story is [when the interviewer offered me a job right on the spot / when I fell off the chair in the middle of answering a question / when we both realized that I'd been having an affair with this particular partner's wife].  But other than that, things have been pretty much as [predicted / feared / fated by a higher power who hates me].  I expect that I'll end up in [my first choice city / some fine city somewhere / Baghdad] with a [fine offer / decent offer / contract out for my disembodied head].  In the event you don't hear from me for the next few weeks, it probably means I [have so many firms competing over my affections that I have no time to e-mail / finally convinced someone to return my calls / am paralyzed from the neck down].  In any event, send my regards to your whole family, and I hope to hear back from you soon with an update on how things are going.  Regards, Me

      I answer all of my interview questions with sentences beginning with consecutive letters of the alphabet, and when I get to Z, I can speak no more.  "Hi. Nice to meet you."  A lovely room, sir. Bed, desk, chairs, it's very nice.  "Yes, thanks.  Please take a seat."  Chair, yes. Don't mind if I do.  "So, how are you liking law school?"  Excellent. Failed no classes. Gorgeous campus. Having a lot of fun.  "Just some administrative stuff first.  Corporate, litigation, what type of law are you looking at?"  I think litigation. Just litigation.  "Anything more specific than that?"  Kids. Litigation involving children. Monkeys or children. Not adults.  "That might be difficult given our client base.  We deal mostly with corporations."  Only corporations?  "Well, no.  But mostly."  Perhaps I can learn to like working with corporations.  "Excellent.  Do you have a transcript I can take a look at?"  Quite definitely. Right here in my folder. Says how I did in my classes.  "Yes, most of them do."  Take it from me.  "Okay.  Thanks.  So how are the interviews going so far."  Under the circumstances, quite nicely.  "What circumstances?"  Very constrained in the answers I can give.  "What do you mean?"  Well, I guess you haven't noticed.  "You do seem to be speaking in short, clipped sentences that each start with gradually successive letters of the alphabet.  I did well on the LSAT.  I have good reasoning skills like that."  Xactly.  "That's cheating."  You won't tell, will you?  "Maybe.  You have to run now, don't you?"  Zipping along, indeed.  "Thanks for taking the time."  --end--

      I answer all of my interview questions in the form of haiku.  "Hi.  Nice to meet you."  Nice to meet you too. I think your firm is awesome. May I take a seat?  "Yes, please do.  So how are you liking law school?"  I like it a lot. My classes are pretty good. My casebooks are long.  "Oh, I remember long casebooks."  Since you were my age, The books have gotten longer. And the streets are paved.  "Yes, yes, back in my day we rode on horseback to class."  Horses are pretty. I did not like Seabuiscuit. Mister Ed is fine.  "So what classes are you taking this semester?"  Constitutional Law, that is.  Con Law.  (U.S.) Plus two more classes.  "Yes, what are those two?"  Administrative Law, that is.  And Evidence. Did you take that class?  "Yes, yes, I did.  So, do you see yourself more as a corporate lawyer, or a litigator."  Not litigation. Maybe corporate law though. Four syllables each.  "What's the difference how many syllables?"  Oh, no reason, sir. It's just an observation. Please don't write that down.  "Do you have a copy of your transcript I can look at?"  Sure, I have it here. Please ignore the middle grade. It was a mistake.  "Oh, okay.  Any questions I can answer for you?"  No.  I think I'm good. Should I go to the door now? Someone is knocking.  --end--

      Costume Party  Ten minutes until curtain.  Great.  Ill be waiting in the hospitality suite.  I feel like Im an actor in a play.  I put on my costume (read: interview suit), and go out and perform for a new audience in every twenty minute slot.  A bit shaky on my lines for the first few performances, but Ive just about memorized them by now. Occasionally it turns into an episode of Whose Line Is It Anyway?  an improvised answer to an unexpected question  but so far, its mostly stayed right on script.  And, like any new show, after each performance I eagerly await the review.  The phone call, I mean.  Or the lack of one.  And like any show, some people like it a lot, and some people dont as much.  Some nights Im on, and some nights Im off.  Sometimes an answer works, sometimes it doesnt.  And its all okay.  If theres one thing thats surprised me about the interview process so far, its how human it is.  We get second chances.  Maybe not with each firm, but with the process  with a dozen, two dozen, even three dozen interviews, we can afford a mistake.  We can deal with a fumbled line, a sleepy afternoon, a bad impression.  And my interviewers have, without exception, seemed like genuinely decent people, just trying their best to really just get something from me in twenty minutes.  In most cases, that thing being a transcript.  Before one of my interviews, I forgot to turn my cell phone ringer off.  I realized it about three minutes in, and spent a few seconds pondering whether or not I should try to somehow slip my hand into my pocket unnoticed, and fumble around with the buttons so it turns off.  But fear that I would accidentally hit something that would cause it to make some sort of sound  or that my interviewer would see and think that I was playing with myself  made me decide to just take the risk it would ring.  I imagined in the back of my head that it would be kind of cool to get a call from another firm while interviewing with this one.  If someone got a call about a callback in the middle of another interview  and the interviewer could tell  would that help someones chances?  If they want him well, shouldnt we want him too?  Of course the phone didnt ring  it never rings (awww)  but the added tension gave the interview that extra zing it had been missing.  At least on my side of the table.  Im not sure how much detail is appropriate when classmates ask how the interviews are going  which of course everyone asks.  Fine seems too vague, but well, I had one on Monday where we talked about my senior thesis, my lackluster Evidence grade, and this rash Ive got on my elbow  and I havent heard anything about a callback yet even though my clairvoyant Aunt Mabel is sure that this is the firm where Ill end up seems too specific.  Same as yours seems like an appropriate enough answer, since, from what I hear, mine pretty much arent any different from anyone elses.  As well as could be expected given my obvious shortcomings is the pessimists answer.  As well as could be expected given that my last interviewer hasnt gotten back to his desk to make the call yet is the optimists answer.  As well as they did last year is the re-interviewing 3Ls answer, and as well as my dry cleaner could dream is the answer for the guy who keeps spilling the free coffee on his shirt and dipping his tie into the fruit tray.  Halloween isnt until the end of the month.  But our costume partys already a week old.  And its only just starting.

      I was going to write a parody song, but I can't find any real song this works with, so I figured I'd just start from scratch.  So this has a tune, trust me... it's just not a tune you've heard before.  "Interview Suit"  Interview Suit Keep you away From anything that is gonna stop me From wearing you one more day  Interview Suit I will be screwed I'm keeping you safe inside some plastic And far away from any food  There's coffee in the corner And fruit out on a tray Chocolate covered pretzels And a deli wrap buffet There is juice inside the pitcher But I'm steering very clear There will be no dirt that's landing on my suit I'm wearing here  Interview Suit Keep you away From anything that is gonna stop me From wearing you one more day  Interview Suit What do you think I'm keeping you safe inside some plastic And away from food and drink  If I bleed I will drip downwards If I sneeze it's to the floor If there's rain I will start crying And walk to the nearest door Because, suit, you were expensive And I've got no other spare Oh for three weeks you're the only thing I wear (at least on the days I have interviews)  Interview Suit Keep you away From anything that is gonna stop me From wearing you one more day  Interview Suit You're such a pain All day I'm running interference To make sure that there's no stain  Interview Suit Keep you away From anything that is gonna stop me From wearing you one more day

      Afternoon playoff games are death to productivity.  Apparently the Red Sox-A's game last night went until the wee hours of the morning.  My TV has a sleep timer, and I was smart to set it.  I missed the good stuff.  Went to sleep when the Red Sox were still in the lead in the 7th or 8th I think.  Sometimes at these interviews, they tape the Attorney's Bio to the door, so you can read it before going in to interview.  They look something like this, but with different words:  Bill Z. Smith Very Senior Partner Salmon, Tuna, Catfish and Haddock LLP  Office: New York  Joined Salmon, Tuna: 05/01/1935  Education: Harvard Law School (LLB, 1932), founding member of Law Review, President of the Students In Favor Of Post-Civil War Reconstruction, Vice-President of the fledgling Automobile Society, Treasurer of the Radio Club; Columbia University (BA, Economics, magna cum laude, 1928) Thesis topic: "Will the economy ever recover from this terrible slump we seem to have been having recently?"  Bar Admissions: New York  Clerkship: Chief Justice William Taft; Chief Justice John Jay  Bill Z. Smith is a very senior partner based in the New York office.  Mr. Smith's practice focuses on financial reorganization, emerging capital markets, and taking out his false teeth for the amusement of others.  Mr. Smith recently celebrated his 68th anniversary at Salmon, Tuna and hopes to be around for 68 years more.  He earns more money than many small nations, and is proud to be distinguished as a featured practitioner in the new guide, "America's Oldest Lawyers."  He is widely published in the AARP's member magazine, Modern Maturity, where he writes a monthly column, "Modern?  Not Me!"  He received his law degree back before the days of electricity, and defended the North during the Civil War.  In his spare time, he enjoys sailing, discus, and piloting his own small plane.  No one else at the firm will fly with him, however.  He is happily married to Ethel, his wife of 142 years, and they have fourteen children, thirty-six grandchildren, eighty-four great-grandchildren, and six hundred thousand great-grandchildren, who make up the population of the entire country of Finland.  He feels bad that his bio, which started out as a subtle attempt at humor, has turned into a ridiculously over-the-top farce that makes little sense.  Mr. Smith can be reached by telegraph at Clydesdale-3-7, or with one of those cans attached to a string.

      Ten Questions I Have Not Been Asked In Any Interviews (yet)  1. How many toes do you have? 2. Can you do any magic tricks? 3. Are you wearing the same white shirt as you wore yesterday, without washing it in between? 4. What are your turn-ons? 5. Are you interested in our Bosnia office? 6. I'm thinking of a number between one and three hundred.  Do you know what it is? 7. Why not dental school? 8. Do you have a scratch-and-sniff version of your resume? 9. Twenty bucks for a callback? 10. Do you need me to call an ambulance?

      Now that baseball's regular season has ended, I find myself with 15 minutes of extra time in the morning that I used to spend setting the lineups for my fantasy baseball teams.  I had 7 of them.  I finished first in 4 of the leagues.  I'm a little obsessed, I know.  On that note, one of my friends had a funny idea that I'm stealing.  Fantasy baseball season may be over, but Fantasy On-Campus-Interviewing season has just begun.  Imagine: students draft their classmates, and earn points based on the number of callbacks, number of offers, etc.  Losing points in categories like "mental errors," "firm mix-ups," "suit stains," and "whoops, I forgot to bring a copy of my transcript."  Callbacks would be worth more in the standings for students not on law review, or with bad grades, or who drool.  Obviously I'm kidding about all of this.  But I thought it was an amusing concept.  And I'm sad I wasn't actually the one who thought of it.

       urlLink In just one hour , you can read Howard Bashman's 20 Questions for Judge Posner.  If you haven't read any of his past "20 Questions With Judges..." features, you're missing out on something very cool.  I hadn't read any until this past Wednesday, when I read them all in one sitting and then felt bad because I should have been doing something more productive.  But they're really interesting.  I'll catch the Posner Q&A tomorrow, since I'm on a mission to get 10 hours of sleep tonight and only have 15 minutes to go before that becomes unlikely.  Quick acrostic poem  Studying is easier when you don't Lie down and fall asleep Every time you open a book Every time you turn a Page.

      An acrostic poem  I think I used to like to learn New Things. Even boring new things. Law school is different. Law is different. Each Case Tells us something. Usually something contradictory to the case before. Alternate ways of seeing things. Law is like that.  Cases are like that. Underlying the whole set of them Rarely seems some unifying theme.  It's a set of rules, and exceptions Or no rules at all. Simply exceptions. I can learn all this stuff, and I pretty much have to, for the exam.  But This time around, I'm just not all that into it. Yet.  I'm sure I will be.  Tomorrow perhaps.

      Study Group Application.  Thank you for applying to be a member of my study group.  I appreciate the interest.  Please fill out the following form with care and place in my mailbox along with a copy of your transcript and resume.  Your submission will be carefully considered and you will hear from me within 48 hours.  NAME: LSAT SCORE:  1. How many days of class have you missed?  (Please enclose documentation to verify.  Acceptable documentation includes: your original handwritten notes from class, a signed slip from the professor, or a laboratory report from tests done on your assigned seat to ascertain whether or not it was used during each class session.)  2. What other commitments do you have between now and the exam?  (Please be specific.  I.e. if you tend to use the bathroom once a day, generally at around six in the evening, please block off ten minutes at that time each day; if you plan on sleeping at all, please mark off the appropriate 90 minute block (90 minutes is the maximum allowed sleep time for participation in my study group; less is encouraged)).  3. What materials can you offer to the group, above and beyond your class notes (which are an obvious pre-requisite) and the class outline you will create as per #7 on the application, infra)?  4. The study group will spend the next two weeks in a secluded location that CANNOT ACCOMMODATE food or beverage.  Will that be a problem?  5. Practice exams are imperative for study group success.  I currently have the complete set of law school exams given at the top 50 schools from 1934 until the present, except for Washington & Lee University's 1956 set.  Will you be able to secure a copy of that set of exams, or, if not, would you be willing to contribute your share to the fund I've establish to track the exams down and recover them (estimated cost per person is $50 plus FedEx costs)?  6. Someone in class sneezed last Tuesday.  Were you that person?  If so, please stop filling out the application, and DO NOT put a copy in my mailbox.  I do not want your germs.  7. Please enclose your course outline (minimum 100 pages).  Thank You.

      Apparently, people who have a bunch of offers and take a while in making up their minds about which to accept start to get phone calls from the firms... just to check up....  Apparently that can start to get overwhelming.  And then people start screening their calls and just letting them go to voice mail.  My in-depth research has unearthed the following transcript of one such voice mail:  "Are you mad at me?  You haven't returned my calls in over a week.  Have I done something wrong?  This is Chuck O'Donnell over at Grinn & Barrett down in DC.  I know this is the ninth voicemail I've left this morning, but I just wanted to try and grab you before the sun came up.  I wanted to get a handle on how your decision process is going, and if there's any more questions I can answer to help you make your choice.  I hope you got the t-shirt we sent that's completely the wrong size and the tin of brownies even though you're allergic to wheat.  Also the expense reimbursement check.  We added on a few dollars just to show our appreciation for you sending the form back to us so quickly.  I happened to be talking to a friend of mine over at Peezin Showers, down the street, and he mentioned how the international landfill division over there has been having some rough times, and that they've started to move people out of that department over to corporate.  I know that was one of your areas of interest, and I don't mean to be talking trash about another firm, but it was just something I heard and thought I'd let you know.  Again, my offer to have you flown back down here for a weekend, to meet some more attorneys, see what we're like, try out our new copy machine - that's still definitely in play, and I can set that up for you with the travel department.  I understand that when you talked to Janice Franklin over in wills and trusts you expressed some concern about the location of the firm and whether it's as easy to get to as a place like Crapper that's right downtown.  I talked to Alan Coleman over in buildings refinance and he said that if you take the offer, we'll actually move the firm over closer to the Metro if that's going to be the stumbling block that's keeping you from saying yes.  I wanted to reiterate that while our gas and electric group is relatively small, first- and second-year associates really do get a chance to do hands-on work, with client contact and all the rest of that stuff people say they want before they realize what it actually means.  I can put you in touch with Jim Greenfield or any of the other partners down there in the basement and he can tell you more about that group.  I do understand that you were concerned about culture, especially with the layoffs last January and the conversion of the attorney game room into a supply closet - which does, incidentally, have the highest-quality paper clips in the city and perhaps the entire region.  We've also been working with one of our clients to upgrade from the yellow post-it notes to the multicolored - I'd expect you'd see results from that ongoing negotiation even as early as this summer.  I'd of course add you to the update list if you'd like to receive the e-mail progress reports we send out to the attorneys each week on that front.  But back to the culture question, I'm really confident that the people we have here are here because they want to be here, and they enjoy their colleagues, the work, and the complimentary bagels on the third Friday of every quarter except when it falls on a weekend.  You'll work hard everywhere, but to know that you're working in a place with people, and with desks, and with doors on every office, is very important.  Plus, as opposed to places like Boies Jackson Sleptwith, we have a top-notch health care plan!  I'm sorry to be taking up so much of your time, but I just wanted to remind you that we'd love to have you join us for the summer and hopefully beyond.  Please give me a call back - you have my number.  I look forward to talking with you soon."

      A  urlLink slideshow  of mock campaign posters by top graphic designers assigned a candidate at random, in the NY Times Magazine this week.  I thought the one for Edwards wasn't bad, and I liked the Carol Moseley Braun one, but the rest didn't really impress me.  It's interesting to think about. Reagan had an effective line in 1980 (or so the history books say), asking "Are you better off than you were four years ago?" when no one was.  Actually the "four years ago" line would probably have a decent amount of resonance this time around, except that it's not really Bush's fault we got attacked by terrorists (I suppose maybe it is, but I'm not nearly informed enough to even think I could debate either side of that one).  But I don't know that I've heard anything from any of the candidates this time around that does that, that really strikes a chord and says "this is what the race is about."  It'll be interesting to see if any of them can find that sound bite and pull away from the pack.

      Big, big, big thumbs up to "Shattered Glass," the movie about Stephen Glass, the writer for The New Republic who made stuff up.  Along with "Spellbound," it's one of my top two movies of the year, no doubt.  If you write -- or even just if you read -- it's a great two hours spent, basically right there in The New Republic's newsroom.  Rich, compelling drama.  But don't take my word for it.  Read  urlLink any review you want .  If I felt more ambitious this evening, I'd write up something longer.  But instead of a movie review, how about a Thanksgiving review?  Or at least a Thanksgiving review template.  I'd like to propose my very own Thanksgiving Ranking System:  There are four key aspects to any Thanksgiving meal.  1. The Food (subcategories: turkey, stuffing, cranberry sauce) 2. The People (subcategories: youth, adult, adult-plus) 3. The Conversation (subcategories: current events, sports, all about you) 4. The Aftermath (subcategories: bathroom, leftovers, personal grudges renewed)  Each of the three subcategories that makes up one of the "Magic Four" gets a score between -10 and +10, inclusive.  The scores are then added up and divided appropriately to give a score for each of the four categories and then an overall Thanksgiving Day score.    Again, if I felt more ambitious, I'd rate my own Thanksgiving.  But I had a good time, and nothing funny happened, so it wouldn't be a very interesting story.  Other people who actually have terribly dysfunctional families where holidays are a chore would be better equipped to wring comic value from their Thanksgivings.  Mine was solid.  Good food, no problems.  Go see "Shattered Glass."  Trust me on this one.

      Here's a  urlLink NY Times article  giving thanks for all sorts of technology: Google, wireless hotspots, digital photography. It got me thinking (just a little bit) about the technology I'm thankful for. I posted over at  urlLink En Banc  my list, shorter, less modern, and less interesting than the author's:  1. The ability to save and correct documents in word processing programs, as opposed to what they did when typewriters were the only technology we had.  2. E-mail.   3. Cell phones.  And then I said that there'd be no reason to use this technology (esp. #2 and #3) if there weren't people on the receiving end. So, more than anything, I'm thankful for the people that are in my life.  Just relevant to this weblog thing, I'm thankful for the handful of people I've met "in real life" because of this, and the others I've exchanged e-mails with.  I'm thankful that enough people have found my words interesting that it's kept me motivated to keep on writing them.  I'm thankful that I haven't written anything that's gotten me any death threats.  I'm thankful that even though at times I've joked that law school can strip people of their humanity, it really doesn't, and there have been lots of great people I've met here and become friends with.  And I'm thankful that perhaps by posting reams of my thoughts on the Internet every day, I've made it more possible not to lose touch with the people I know who aren't here, and I don't see every day.  And I'm thankful that it's very hard to come up with a reason why grades matter, because I really don't know what the difference between rational basis and strict scrutiny is, and surely that's a key to success on my Con Law exam in two weeks.  I'm thankful that nothing in my life has led me to believe that this isn't a world filled with interesting, good, and fundamentally decent people.  I'm thankful for the health of my friends and family.  I'm thankful that I never changed the address on my cell phone bill and so my mom just seems to end up paying it every month.  I'm thankful that the strange noise the heat makes in my apartment doesn't keep me up at night.  I'm thankful that I get to eat food today that (a) wasn't made in a cafeteria, and (b) won't cost me anything.  Happy Thanksgiving.

      Okay, I've just spent the last whole bunch of hours when I should have been either studying for exams or, better yet, doing something fun, making the following:   urlLink Jeremy's Index   It's basically an index to most of what I've posted here, since I realized when I was trying to dig up the real exam advice yesterday that it was really hard to find anything.  Perhaps this was just an exercise for my own benefit, but that's fine -- I just thought it would be cool to have an index of what's here.

      According to  urlLink this article ,  urlLink The Onion  is working on a "pay section" of their website.  Not that The Onion's not worth it (sometimes), but given the number of things on the Internet that are free... and given that The Onion's really just got about ten minutes worth of new content to read per week (at least the current stuff... and the article says that the current stuff'll still be free, it'll just be extra stuff... but still)....  I don't know how the economics end up working out for websites that charge money, but given how much is out there for free on the Internet, and even just given that it sounds more expensive to say $12.50 for a year of access than "a quarter a week at your local newsstand," and given that if I was paying for a website, I'd have much more rigorous demands that its content be consistently awesome... I don't see how it makes tons of sense for them to put at risk the 5 million visitors they get a month (according to the article) -- and the mindshare that has given them;  everyone's  heard of The Onion -- in the hopes of converting some money out of it... although if they could even get a penny from each visitor (and that I suppose even I'd pay), they'd be doing pretty nicely....  It would seem to make more sense to do what they've done with books of content that cost money, and to branch out into more arenas -- charge for a monthly magazine, perhaps; maybe theme restaurants (huh?), TV... I don't know.  I'm just skeptical that when there's too much to read on the Internet anyway, a website could actually keep a good chunk of its audience while charging money.

      I don't even need to make stuff up today.  Two stories.  1. In Constitutional Law today, we were talking about physician-assisted suicide and upbeat stuff like that.  The professor was discussing the potential ramifications of a regime where anyone could just ask his physician to help him die, and that would be legal.  This is perhaps a slight exaggeration of the picture the professor painted, but it's pretty close, I think:   ...so then you'd potentially have families trying to convince their elderly and sick parents and grandparents to die, to guilt them into it.  "Grandma, don't you remember, you promised Johnny you'd pay for his college education and now all your money's being spent to keep you alive;" "Grandma, it's not like you're going to get any better, so why not just go now;" "Grandma, it's a real hassle having to keep coming to visit you, it's disrupting our lives, it's just not very convenient for us;" "Grandma, don't you feel bad that you're using all of these medical resources that could be spent on someone younger, with a better end outcome, with more of a life to look forward to, don't you feel like you're being just a little bit selfish?"  And you're all laughing, but it might be closer to reality than you think.   We also talked about a case in Washington (I believe) where the Supreme Court struck down a law that would have allowed non-parents to petition a court for child visitation right against the will of the parent.  I assume the statute meant to apply to grandparents, and step-parents, and things like that... but I could definitely see that being the kind of statute Michael Jackson would support.  (You saw that one coming, didn't you?)  2. And, from another professor in class today: "I had a dream that I called on a student, and then he died."

      I felt bad offering up some useless advice about finals yesterday without at least combing through my archives and digging up some actual stuff I wrote about finals last year -- not that I have all the answers, by any stretch, but in case any 1Ls want to read about what I did to prepare and any actual thoughts I have on the subject.  So... having combed through my archives:   urlLink Exam Thoughts 1: All about outlining... the monster exam advice post    urlLink Exam Thoughts 2: "Yes, outlining's important, but you should do practice exams"    urlLink Exam Thoughts 3: "What about study groups?"    urlLink Exam Thoughts 4: "But the exam is only worth 100% of the grade!"

      Retiring NY Times food critic William Grimes is interviewed  urlLink here , and if you like food even just a little bit, it's a fun little read.  Being a food critic would be a cool job.  Unless you were a food critic for one of those free college or grad school magazines that litter university mailrooms and had to go around the country trying different dining hall food.  That would be the job from hell.  In fact, if anyone reading this ever finds his or her onto "Inside the Actor's Studio" on Bravo, I think that job would be a unique and worthwhile contribution to that sometimes-interesting questionnaire they have at the end of each interview where they ask about the favorite curse word, favorite sound, occupation you would least like to try.  That would be a really awful job.  UPDATE: Will Baude over at  urlLink Crescat Sententia  proved himself more intellectually curious than I, and checked on Grimes' claim that he never used the words "studded" or "slathered" in his reviews.  See the link for the results.

      Some useless advice for 1Ls about studying for exams that sounds a lot like most of the advice people gave me last year.  1. Make sure you absolutely read every case over again, because cases really won't be very important on the exam; it's the concepts that count, except sometimes.  2. It's crucial to talk about policy except when the question doesn't ask about it.  3. Most people I know just crammed for the few nights before each exam, except for the people who methodically paced themselves over a few weeks.  One group did better than the other but I forget which.  4. The right study guide can be a godsend, but the wrong one can lead to disaster.  5. Using other people's notes to check your own is helpful if the other person happens to take better notes than you do; otherwise it can just throw you off.  The way to tell if someone's notes are better than yours is to wait until after the exam and see who did better.  6. The key is to get into the professor's head, but not too much because that might be a trap.  7. Some professors give you credit for everything you write down so you shouldn't worry if you have something wrong; other professors will take credit away if there's wrong stuff so you should be careful.  8. My favorite exams are the ones with word limits -- I mean the ones without.  I think.  No, I don't remember.  9. None of it matters anyway, because the exams are so hard that only the students who study effectively are going to do well, and so what's the point unless someone gives you some solid advice, which is really easy to get but not from me.  10. Some professors repeat exams they've used before.  Most don't.

      Another song parody:  Big Firm (to the tune of Big Shot by Billy Joel)  I went walking into the interview room In my dads best navy blue suit You had the nicest suite in the place And the recruiter was cute And when I sat down for the interview It went so well And you didnt even look at my grades You offered me a callback And you told me how much Ill get paid  Oh but you had to be a big firm, didn't you The kind wholl work me dawn till night You had to be a big firm, didn't you A little stuffy and uptight You had to have all day face time The fourteen year partner track You had to have a sweatshop label It had to be a big firm that night  They were all impressed with my LSAT test And the journal work I said that I did And they didnt uncover The felony conviction I hid They say they have free frozen yogurt And a subsidized gym And a dental plan that hasnt a peer But its three thousand hours Or no bonus at the end of the year  Oh man you had to be a big firm, didn't you The kind wholl work me to the death You had to be a big firm, didn't you You better bill your every breath You want to bill pro bono? No chance. How bout a document review You have to put the job first, job last It had to be a big firm, run fast  Well the tobacco moneys gonna pay your rent And the asbestos moneys buying your meals And all the money theyre getting From the mafia is buying you wheels  No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big firm, didn't you You want to squeeze the life from me You had to be a big firm, didn't you But what else goes with this degree? You treat me like a king all summer So much fun to practice law And then you pull the rug out leaving My friends and family grieving -- big firm, whoa  You had to be a big firm, didnt you?

      Thanks to  urlLink Howard Bashman  for the link, and for calling this the funniest current law student blog.  I'll try to live up.  Someone e-mailed me yesterday asking for advice.  She wrote:     Maybe you could help me with a dilemma I'm having  involving a lawyer [I work with].  The problem is that I have a secret crush on him, and while I'd first like to know if he's interested, the more important task is to come up with pick-up lines for lawyers or suggestive law office banter (beyond the obvious "hey, nice briefs").  I figured [you] might be able to offer up some funny suggestions.   An unusual challenge.  Note that if I was making up this e-mail, I'd be wise to make up something that I felt more confident I could execute well.  Nevertheless, here's the best I can do.  Ten Really Really Bad Pick-Up Lines For Lawyers  1. "I know a great way I could serve justice today... should I stop by your office?" 2. "Ow.  You stepped on my foot.  But I've got an idea for how you can mitigate your damages." 3. "I hear you give great oral... arguments." (predictable, i know) 4. "Is that a new cologne you're wearing?  I like your dis-scent." (ooh, that one's really bad) 5. "I know a whole new de-position we could try" (huh?) 6. "I find you very appeal-ing" (thanks,  urlLink howard ) 7. "Before I went into law, I worked in restitution... uh, I mean prostitu-- you get the drift." (i'm terrible at this) 8. "I've got a one-pronged test we could try together." 9. "Meeting of the minds?  Actually, I had some other parts in mind." 10. "I've heard what they say about guys with big foot... notes."  Two bonuses if it's bankruptcy law:  11. "You invite me over, and it'll be an  automatic stay -the-night." 12. "Don't worry about that, it's just a strange  discharge ."

      Following up on my post below about the NY Times Magazine article on internet dating sites.  www.JD-DATE.com, the new law student dating site designed to help you find the man or woman of your objectively manifested intent (dreams are too subjective).  Step 1.  Complete this quick and easy survey.  1. I am a (male / female / too much studying has made me forget) seeking a (male / female / whatever, I'm lonely, I just need human contact, any sort will do)  2. What type of relationship are you looking for? (a) a marriage of mutual convenience -- mutual support as we both climb the ladder to managing partner (b) something we'll both regret in the morning when we see each other in Con Law class  3. My ideal match: (a) only speaks in class when called on, and hardly even then (b) is a gunner  4. If you were a law school course, your name would be: (a) Family Law (b) Entertainment Law (c) Criminal Law, with a focus on Rape  5. Your ideal first date: (a) study group, you and me and practice exams from the last seven years (b) a hot night of passion over Instant Messenger (c) we'll hang out at a bar... -bri class  Step 2.  Essays.  Essay 1. Describe yourself, citing at least five prominent cases. (Example: I'm a 2L, originally from the defendant state in the Lawrence case.  I enjoy eating the animal litigated in the Frigaliment case, went to undergrad at the school at issue in Grutter and Gratz, and have a rich uncle who has promised me an inheritance if I find a nice girl to marry, and stay away from drugs (see Hamer v. Sidway).  I'm also looking forward to impregnating a girl and convincing her to have an abortion (Roe v. Wade), but not a partial birth abortion, although they are allowed (Stenberg v. Carhart).)  Essay 2. Write an issue-spotter featuring you, your date, and at least eight potential legal issues (Example: John goes to pick up Sara at her parents' house.  Her parents bought the house in 1972 from the owner of a set of six contiguous plots of land, each containing a house.  When they purchased the house, they did not negotiate for use of the connecting driveway.  The deed illustrates that the land purchased includes only half of the aforementioned driveway, yet Sara's parents have been using it for years without complaint.  However, when John goes to pick up Sara, and crosses the driveway, neighbor Bob yells out the window of his house, demanding that John get off his land.  Bob also bought his plot from the original owner, but he signed a covenant promising that there would be no blue cars ever on the property of anyone in the entire subdivision.  Of course, John's car is blue.  Sara's parents met in 1966 but have never married.  In the state we are in, there is no common-law marriage rule, and property is divided 50/50 upon divorce.  John is distracted by Bob's yelling, drives his car into the house, and runs over Sara's mother, Betty.  Betty, who does not have a living will, is transported by helicopter to County Hospital.  On the way to the hospital, the helicopter passes over a highway where Frank, drunk and known to have seizures, is driving home.  Ten minutes prior, he picked up a hitchhiker at the side of the road, who wears thick glasses.  As the helicopter passes over the highway, Frank steals the hitchhiker's glasses and throws the hitchhiker out of the car.  The helicopter crashes, killing the hitchhiker, Betty's mom, and the helicopter pilot, who mailed his health insurance premium yesterday, but it has not yet been received by his insurance company.  Meanwhile, Sara's father, who is in this country illegally, is detained by the police and sent to a camp outside the United States but under American control.  John offers Sara a tranquilizer to calm her down from all of this commotion, and while she is in a state of semi-consciousness, he induces her to transfer to him one hundred bushels of wheat at 14 cents per bushel, at a date set three months in the future.  Sometime between Tuesday at 10 PM and Wednesday at 2 AM (exact time is uncertain, although a videotape that was recovered through the use of an undercover informant may provide more information) a tornado causes wheat prices to rise dramatically (as well as destroying John's blue car, which has an insurance policy that reads, "acts of natural disaster will be covered only if they happen on Tuesdays), and John seeks to enforce the agreement.  The date ends with a kiss.)  Essay 3. Describe your LSAT score in 200 words or less.  Step 3.  Submit a transcript, writing sample, and three references.  A member of the JD-Date.com staff will contact you soon if you have been selected for an on-campus interview.

      A long article in this week's NY Times Magazine about  urlLink internet dating sites .  It's a balanced article -- not saying these sites are great or awful, but that they exist and all sorts of people are on there.  I could go for an easy joke here, probably involving Michael Jackson; I could try something more ambitious, like fake profiles for a bunch of law student personality types (and, in fact, I'll probably try that later and see what happens); or I could make this one of those posts where I tell you actually how I feel about something and aren't necessarily trying to be funny but use the word "peanut butter" somewhere in there for a laugh.  Read the article; take a little nap; when you come back before the night is over there'll be something here, either trying to be funny or not, depending on how quickly the Robitussin I just took kicks in and stops my nose from running.  (There's also a really interesting article about  urlLink John Edwards  and behind-the scenes preparing for one of the Democratic debates.  I like this kind of stuff.  Once again, the NY Times Magazine stopping me from doing real work.  Cool.

This notice is printed in invisible ink and no other notice will be given.

      The always excellent  urlLink Howard Bashman  points to some information about  urlLink "Amicus Humoriae: An Anthology of Legal Humor."  It's a compilation of trying-to-be-funny law review articles.  I'm skeptical, and a little scared that if the cards fall in a certain way, it's a frightening glimpse of my future.  An entry in an anthology, next to two dozen other wannabe-humor writers that took the risk-averse path instead.  But I'll give it a chance and have a review for y'all sometime in the not too distant future (but after exams, probably).

      "The library's closed over Thanksgiving weekend?  That sucks!"  According to the law school's weekly newsletter about campus goings-on, the library will be closed next Thursday through Saturday.  That stinks.  Because I was planning on spending my entire Thanksgiving weekend reading old copies of the Hastings Law Journal and catching up on my Lexis research.  How dare they close the library.  With only 60 hours of open-library time that week, there won't be enough hours to finish my reading!  Anyway... other things from this week's newsletter:  1. Drop-In Times for "Ask the Dietitian" -- Are you interested in improving your overall nutrition?  The Nutrition Service at Harvard University Health Services is excited to offer this new option for students.  >>Yeah, um, thanks.  Good thing you didn't use the money this is costing to, I don't know, improve the cafeteria food...  2. HLS Veterans Association Magazine/Book Drive -- Our servicemen and servicewomen would greatly appreciate new materials to read in their downtime.  >>Hmmm... I can go two ways with this joke.  Either "I bet they'd love some porn" or "Do they really want old copies of the Technology Law Journal to keep them company in Iraq?"  3. Professor seeks part-time office help... answering phones, filing, typing... please send a brief description of your qualifications...  >>My *qualifications* ??  Maybe I'm overestimating my fellow students, but are there any law students NOT qualified to file and type?  Come on...  4. Lost: Bookbag -- "Contents more important than the (expensive) bag"  >>Return it because I am (filthy) rich.  5. The Georgetown Journal on Poverty Law and Policy is soliciting articles...  >>I'm guessing there's no cash prize.  6. 2L/3L add/drop requests "can be e-mailed... only on dates that the Registrar's Office is open for business."  >>This kind of understanding of how information technologies work is why we can't get our grades online, isn't it?  7. Student Animal Legal Defense Fund Thanksgiving Potluck... e-mail for ideas for animal-free dishes  >>Uh, I think that would be -- EVERYTHING BUT THE TURKEY.  Seriously, right?

      Today in Constitutional Law, we talked about abortion.  In Local Government Law we talked about suburban sprawl and the decline of central cities.  In Bankruptcy we talked about mass tort cases like asbestos and breast implants, and how bankruptcy law can change the normal rules.  I know I'm usually pretty cynical about this law school stuff, but all three of those classes were awfully fascinating.  Possibly more than any day yet at law school -- these were the kinds of classes people imagine having at law school before they get here.  Real issues, issues that people have real feelings about, and how the law shapes them and the policies behind them and learning to look at them with some kind of framework and intelligence.  Good stuff.  If every class was half as compelling as any one of today's three, I'd have considerably less to write about.

It's gonna be B  I got no choice, babe, except to try Maybe I should just give up The clerkships -- too hard to see Cause in the end you know it's gonna be B Let down my mom I'm not da bomb  [CHORUS]  It's gonna be B Ooh yeah  There'll be a day When maybe I'll get just one A Till then, It's gonna be B  I think I'd find If I read the prof's mind My answers were great But still it's my fate I'm destined to a grade of B Mediocrity Guess what?

      We received an e-mail from the law school dean, that said in part:   "We wanted to let you know that the Law School's Physical Planning Committee is undertaking a feasibility study to explore the possibility of renovating [the student center]... [which is currently] in our view, is a woefully inadequate facility. ...[T]he public spaces in the [student center] can be dramatically improved in appearance, lighting, layout, and functionality. Our students, and our community more broadly, deserve a better facility."   The e-mail asked for students to send their thoughts to the Planning Committee.  But wouldn't they have been more likely to receive a response if they used a friendly multiple-choice questionnaire like this one??  1. I visit the student center: (a) every day, so that I am able to, in comparison, more fully appreciate the lighting and layout of my 118-square-foot apartment or dorm room when I go home. (b) only when there's a special event, like a student organization deciding that the student center is the best place for them to hold a party, or the weekly "Turkey Monday" lunches that both foreshadow and recall happy Thanksgivings past and future. (c) when I'm desperate to go the bathroom, but don't want to use a clean one. (d) to check my mail once a semester and throw out the fourteen advertisements for class rings, seven flyers regarding the "early-bird discounts" on ordering a yearbook, five firm recruiting brochures, three pieces of melted candy a journal threw in my box to thank me for checking footnotes for an hour last October, and a printed "backup copy" of an e-mail someone sent me six weeks ago.  2. My favorite part of the student center is: (a) the pool table with 12 balls. (b) the handicapped doors. (c) Bill, the guy who stuffs the mailboxes with class ring advertisements four times a week. (d) the smell.  3. My least favorite part of the student center is: (a) its colorful brown color scheme. (b) the message board featuring one hundred and forty-three flyers in an 8X11 inch space, all stapled one on top of the other. (c) the permanent stack of Harvard Magazine from three years ago. (d) the "summer job evaluations" collections box.  4. When I meet my friends in the student center, we: (a) leave as soon as possible. (b) take pleasure in recycling the stacks and stacks of class ring advertisements we find in our mailboxes. (c) enjoy relaxing on one of the comfortable counters and tables that can also serve as temporary seating. (d) share a day-old doughnut from the cafeteria.  5. If I was going to build a new student center, I'd make sure it had: (a) a food vendor that wasn't managed by an institutional bureaucracy. (b) walls that weren't brown. (c) space for flyers, newspapers, and advertisements to all coexist peacefully and in user-friendly ways. (d) a bulletin board summarizing all of the upcoming law school events. (e) meeting rooms. (f) free cookies.

      The F-Word  Two of my professors used the F-word in class this week.  That's right, "finals."  Seems like the semester's just started, and already it's time to worry about actually opening the casebooks and doing some reading.  As a 1L, finals are scary because they're new, and you don't know what to expect, or where you stack up as a 2L, finals are scary because last fall as 1Ls we got about a month to study (finals after winter break), and this time we get about three days (finals before break).  So the week I spent making an outline for criminal law that would eventually prove relatively useless is now condensed into about three hours of scrolling through my constitutional law class notes and deleting the limericks I wrote during lecture:           There once was a case named Brown         That made schools integrate all 'cross town         Think "equal protection"         Think "Plessy's rejection"         Think I'd better write this one down.   Heck, maybe I should keep the limericks and delete all the rest of my notes.   What makes it hard to really get nervous about finals this time around is that due to the fact that the recruiting season starts further in advance of when we'll actually be working than presidential candidates start campaigning for the next election (now there's a forced analogy), many of us have jobs already lined up - and it's possible that no one may look at our law school transcripts ever again.  And, as the familiar saying sort of goes, if an exam gets written in the forest but nobody sees the grade, did the exam ever really take place?  Perhaps it's all just a bad dream - an 8-hour night's sleep spent taking a take-home in real-time, a nightmare of issue-spotting and conclusion-drawing.  An event that takes place only in our subconscious, as machines grade the test papers while we try to save the dock sorry, still trying to figure out what the Matrix movie I saw last night means.  I have no idea what I'm talking about.  It did look good in IMAX, though, although it cost more than a constitutional law study guide would, and I probably need that more.           There's sometimes a scrutiny strict         For when statutes seem to afflict         A race, not a gender         Although it depend-er         It's hard, oftentimes, to predict.   Yeah, that's a helpful one.  What's been interesting about classes this year is that I've heard lots of people talk about how they'll be assigned the same cases for multiple courses.  Topics like the dormant commerce clause (please don't ask me what that is), or environmental regulations, or "how to fake your way through being on panel without having done the reading" have come up over and over again.  I can visualize the overlap fairly clearly - cases about education can fit in constitutional law, local government law, law and education, family law, federal courts, just off the top of my head; cases about bestiality can fit in animal law, family law, animal family law, family animal law, the law of nature. It makes me imagine it's pretty possible to sign up for three courses and end up only having to read for two, because it would all overlap.  Which I suppose is still more work than signing up for four classes and reading for none of them.  Or signing up for no classes and writing a bunch of limericks and calling it a third-year paper.           There's speech that's protected and free         I don't know which speech that might be         But for sure, I suppose         There's an outline that knows         It's an outline that I'd like to see   I can also write haiku.  But I don't think that'll do anything for my exam grade.  The "f-word" is finals.  But there's another f-word out there too.  I'll leave that one to your imagination.

      A few notes:  1. I got a phone call today from a friend letting me know that my weblog was mentioned in an article in National Jurist magazine, which they give out for free in the student center here and I imagine in lots of other places.  They did an article on weblogs, quoted me saying something about my weblog -- they'd e-mailed me a while ago, but I wasn't sure when the article was going to run and to what extent I'd be mentioned in it -- and their sidebar is a piece I wrote a while back making fun of some law firm names.  I don't think it's the best thing I've written on here, but it's okay.  If you've arrived here after seeing the link in there: (1) welcome, and (2) the thing in the magazine is not the best thing I've written on here.  Scroll down; I think you'll like.  If you want to be dropped right in the middle of a bunch of stuff about callback interviews, you can try  urlLink here  or  urlLink here .  If you want a cool song parody, you can try  urlLink here .  Today was the first day the magazine was in our student center here; I don't know if we get it first, last, or pretty much when everyone else does.  No noticeable spike in hits, but I'm not sure I expect one.  2. I saw Matrix: Revolutions in IMAX tonight.  It is way cool to see a movie on an IMAX screen (and at $15.50, way expensive).  I didn't really understand the movie, but seeing it on IMAX almost made up for that.  Way cool.  I want to see more movies on IMAX, only next time with a plot I can follow and hopefully with some funny too.  3. A link to my article in the Harvard Law Record about the  urlLink environmental law conference  here last week (disclaimer: it's not funny).  I'll link to my  urlLink hazing column  too, but if you read it on here last Friday, you've already seen it.  No real change.  4. Saw a newspaper headline: "Michael Jackson's Dad -- I Whipped Him But Never Beat Him."  Pick your punchline: (1) Well, those *are* two different blender settings; (2) So "Beat It" wasn't based on a true story?; (3) "I also cut his nose off"  Eh, maybe three aren't better than one.

       urlLink The Score Bard , who writes awfully clever baseball poetry and has a couple of awfully fun baseball distractions on his site (Fantasy Draft Simulator is a nice time-waster) posted a poem  urlLink recently  wishing he had more readers.  And, lo and behold, it's getting him an awful lot of links.  Like this one.  In some ways, asking for it seems like cheating, I don't know why.  I feel like good content ought to bring the links and the readers, not an express request.  Not that he doesn't have good content, because, word for word, it's probably among the most creative and well-written sites out there, but, like he writes somewhere on the site recently, he doesn't update every day, because poetry's not like that.  But that makes it easy to forget about a site, and stop going back.  Like I hadn't been there since April or May, until I saw a link somewhere this morning -- and it doesn't take all that long to catch up.  So the new links'll get him visitors, but if there's two weeks between content, they probably won't come back.  I don't know where I'm going with this post.  Personally, in a way I see it as a challenge to write content good enough that people want to link to, so when my visitor numbers take a jump on a particular day, I feel like I've actually created worthy content that people are either telling other people about or linking to from somewhere.  And maybe that's not how it works, but I don't know.  I understand the Score Bard's frustration -- I'd love more people to be reading my words, anyone would... but I feel like the way to get there is content people are motivated to come back to, not threatening to stop writing if more people don't link to me or tell their friends to come read my site.  Internet blackmail.  :)  Which isn't exactly what he did, but it's kind of what he did.  Nevertheless, I give him a pass since his site is so creative and unique and he's clearly talented.  But if CNN.com starts complaining on its home page that it wishes it had more readers, you won't see a link from me....

      One of the courses I'm taking this semester is Local Government Law.  Basically the laws governing cities, and suburbs, and counties, and how they relate to each other, and to the states, and to the federal government, and how people are affected by local government and how they affect it.  Urban sprawl, local school funding, things like that.  A theme we've returned to a bunch of times has to do with our sense of place identity -- where do we come from?  Do we come from, for example, "America," or "Nebraska," "Pine Bluffs," (I'm imagining there's got to be a city in Nebraska called Pine Bluffs.  I don't know why.  It just sounds right.  Pine Bluffs, Nebraska.  Even though probably no pine trees there) "The Pine Bluffs Condo Subdivision," etc.  People from suburban Chicago often say they're from "Chicago" even though they're not.  People here in Cambridge say they live in Boston when we don't.  Are you from where you were born, where you lived when you were growing up, where you went to college, where you live now, or somewhere else entirely?  I was born in New York -- well, Brooklyn, actually, but I say New York -- and I grew up there.  Over the past 7 years, I've been in New York for probably no more than 18 months of calendar time, including vacations and summers and the 8 months I was home in between leaving the job I had in Texas after college and starting law school.  I've lived in Princeton and Austin, Texas for longer than that, in Cambridge almost as long, and have spent about 3 months total in Washington, DC and 4 months as a summer camp counselor in the Poconos.  That pretty much covers where I've lived.  But in my head, it's a no-brainer that "home" is New York.  I'm sure for other people, home is where they are now.  For people whose parents might have moved since "growing up" in a certain place, home might be a place where they don't know anyone, or home might be a new place, or there might be no "home."  All of this is a long-winded introduction to some thoughts I've been having tonight -- as I do my reading on urban sprawl for Monday's local government law class (no e-mails asking me why I'm doing Monday's reading on Thursday night, please), I'm thinking about how transient our society really is today.  People don't stay in one place, people don't always have roots, people pack up and move, leave friends and family behind, sometimes not just once but over and over and again.  We become part of people's lives, and then it all just sort of dissipates.  My grandmother has a friend that she's had for 80 years.  They live in different cities now, but for the longest time they didn't, and a bond was able to form over many decades.  We have fewer of these bonds now.  We spend a few years with a set of people at school -- and they're our friends, sure -- maybe even friends for life, if we're lucky.  But lots of people -- outside of a spouse and an immediate family -- for the most part don't have these lifetime connections, these years and years of shared experiences and the strengthening of bonds that happens over time.  Our bonds are more easily shattered when we move from place to place.  Even with phones, even with e-mail, even with a daily-updated weblog....  It's kind of sad to think about it.  In a lot of ways, a lot of time we're the only souls we really know.  It's hard to get deep enough to really know what someone else is thinking, to know them well enough that you understand them -- because two years ago you didn't know them, and two years from now you'll be across the world and -- still peripherally in their lives, perhaps, but not in the same way, not in a deeper sense than "just got a new job, family's good, how about you?"  It's a sacrifice we make for a global society I guess, for the chance to chase education and dreams and passions and career opportunities.  In a way, I think it makes us less happy than people might have been before all this transience and impermanence.  It saddens me a little bit when I think about it.  I understand it, and I accept it as what life is about in today's world, but it makes me feel a little empty inside.  These four walls all look the same My neighbors may not know my name 'Cause one day soon I will be gone  Another year, another place As I move forward in the race And alone I walk along  It's a transient world and there's no time to lay down roots From behind the wheel to a pair of walking boots Who you get to know will just be part of memory It's a transient life for you, and for me  And even if you're in the lead There's a part of you that needs To plant your seeds and watch them grow  It's superficial in some ways To see new faces every day To be the only soul you know  And when the road comes to an end When there's finally nothing lying around the bend You want a place to go back home to Not a place to walk alone to  It's a transient world and there's no time to make wounds heal To know what others think, and to know what others feel Harder now to make the road mean something worth the trip Gotta hang on tight and watch your grip  (There's a melody in there too -- it's a song lyric, in case that wasn't obvious.  MP3 on request?  Maybe.  I dunno.  Sure.)  See, not every post ends with a top ten list.  :)

      I've never performed stand-up comedy.  I wouldn't be very good at it.  Nevertheless, if I ever were to...  My Very Own Bad Stand-Up Routine about being a Law Student, Draft One*  (*"Draft One" means I'm writing this on the fly without planning it out first.  I imagine real stand-up comics do some editing and rewrites.  Although most I've seen don't sound as if they do.)  Hey.  My name is Jeremy, and I'm a law student.  Law students are generally boring, so I apologize in advance if I'm boring.  I was going to start by saying something like, "although it's not visible on the outside, I'm a law student," but I realized that now that I'm in my second year, the horns and tail have started to grow in, so if you look closely, you can pretty much tell I'm on my way to becoming a lawyer.  People hate lawyers, mostly because lawyers hate people.  When I started law school, I didn't have any idea what a lawyer did.  I figured he sat in his office and manufactured money, or something like that.  Which, in fact, is what lawyers do.  The big perk about being a lawyer is being able to charge for your time.  See, most people can only charge for their work, so if you do things fast, you make more money.  But lawyers are special.  To make more money, lawyers have to work really slowly.  The slower we work, the more hours we can bill, and the more money we can make.  As law students, we practice working slowly all the time.  It's part of the homework.  And law students get used to working slowly, so that by the time we become lawyers, we do everything slowly.  It's why lawyers need to take two-hour lunches.  Last night for homework I spent an hour on the toilet. I got an A.  Actually I got three of them.  Lately I've been consumed with the job search.  While in most industries you look for a job after you leave school, or at least when you're getting ready to -- in law school, even though it's 3 years long, you start looking for a job the moment you arrive on campus.  Our first meeting, the first week of school, was with the career office.  "Welcome to law school.  You haven't learned anything yet.  It's time to find a job."  Law jobs -- or at least law student jobs -- divide into two categories.  There's law firm jobs, and there's what they call "public interest."  Theoretically, public interest means helping people, which makes it the opposite of a law firm job, where you hurt people.  Actually, you don't hurt all people.  Just people who don't own big companies.  But everyone owns a big company, right?  I just bought IBM, in fact.  Yesterday.  I spent fourteen hours on the toilet to earn enough money.  This working slowly thing, it really does the trick.  Anyway.  Law firms, and public interest.  In practice, "public interest" just amounts to everything that isn't a law firm.  Working for the government, working for an advocacy group -- like the Citizens for Bigger Vegetables, or something like that, pretty much anything.  At my school, they give out public interest funding for people who don't work at a law firm for their first summer after year one of law school.  You can pretty much get public interest funding for anything.  Lighting forest fires, kicking the elderly, tossing puppies down the sewer.  As long as it's not a law firm.  That's the first summer.  But at the end of the first summer, the job search starts for the second summer.  Seriously.  There are schools where the recruiting process starts in August for the following June.  And what's special about the second summer, is that these law firms that hire people for the second summer are really hiring people for after they graduate.  The vast majority of people get offers from their second summer firm.  Basically to not get an offer, or so I've been told by some of my friends -- talking slowly in a monotone, since they're law students -- you need to do something bad.  Not just bad like "I didn't finish my work" bad, or "I stole your sandwich from the refrigerator" bad.  Bad like "I got you indicted" bad, or "I maxed out your home equity line of credit and spent it on a new husband for your wife" bad.  Bad stuff.  And that becomes your job for after law school.  So by the end of the fall of your second year -- of a three-year program -- you've pretty much got your job for after you finish.  So if you enter law school in, say, September of 3006, then by October of 3007, you basically know what you're going be doing in the fall of 3009.  And that way you get two years to pack up all of your stuff for the move to Neptune, and you can charge up the spaceship in the garage.  [Okay, that's enough for now.  I have no idea if this is funny or just dumb.  If you think it's funny, let me know and I'll write more.  If not, I probably will anyway, but at least then I'll know I have to try harder.]

      I guess this is law school application season.  I should be sleeping, but instead I'm going to see what I can come up with if I promise five pieces of advice for applicants to consider when deciding whether law school is the right choice.  1. Know why you're going.  This is the biggest one.  There's lots of reasons -- burning desire to practice law, want a stable career that will enable a good living, are interested in the education, think it'll be good training for business or political careers, mom and dad said they'll pay and so why not.  I don't want to judge the reasons, and I think even that last one is legitimate if it's really your situation.  My advice is just to know what that reason is, to be able to articulate it, and to use that decision as the foundation of your school choice.  Make sure the reason and the school you pick match up well.  If you're there to get a job, go to the best school you can find, and if it's not a top school, make sure it's in the city you want to eventually work in, or you won't find a job that easily.  If you're there to play softball, don't go to a school in Boston.  If you're there to do environmental law, don't go to a school without any environmental law professors.  You know what I mean.  2. Know how you're going to pay for it.  Loans are great.  But have your eyes open going in.  If you're going to need to take out a gazillion dollars in loans, you may find yourself stuck in a position of needing to take a law firm to pay them back.  If that's what you want, then great.  But go in realizing that if you want to do public interest law, you may need to find a school with a loan forgiveness program, or some other way to keep the pressure down to have to go take a job you don't want to take, and then regret going to law school to begin with.  3. Know that you're ready.  Everyone's different, but, personally, I'm glad I took some time in between college and law school.  Having a job for a little bit provides some perspective, I think, and makes you not take school so seriously, and makes you feel lucky to be in school and have a student schedule.  Unless you have a compelling reason not to, it may not be a bad idea to defer and go do something for a year, get a sense of the real world, so your first job is not the law firm job, and you'll have something to compare it to.  But everyone's different, and maybe some people are mature enough to not need the time between, or already have the perspective I thought my time gave me.  I don't know.  4. Know where you want to be.  For a top school, maybe it's worth uprooting yourself to someplace new.  You'll make friends, there's lots of people at every school who aren't from there and don't have an already-established life.  But if going somewhere in particular has the potential to make you miserable -- far away from things you want to be near -- think about whether it's worth it.  It's hard to like school when you're not liking life.  Obviously it's a trade off and can balance in either direction.  But it's just something to think about, I think.  5. Know how to read.  There's a bunch of reading in law school.  If you don't like to read stuff -- or at least if you have trouble reading dense stuff -- you may not like it at law school.  The work overall isn't really that bad, I don't think -- there's less writing than in college, fewer tests, possibly less work overall although some people disagree.  But there is a lot of reading.  If you are illiterate, law school may not be the place for you.  Although you may find my weblog more entertaining than it deserves.  :)

      Right now, Harvard's 92nd Ames Finals Moot Court Competition is going on.  Three famous judges I've never really heard of are presiding over oral arguments in a fake case; two teams of 6 students each, who beat out a couple dozen other teams in the preliminary rounds, are competing in order to win the case and add another line to their alreday-stellar resumes.  The teams this year are the Paul Wellstone Memorial Team (Petitioner), and the John Ritter Memorial Team (Respondent).  No, I'm getting that wrong.  It's John Rawls, not John Ritter.  Oops.   Here's what the fake case is about, taken from the Harvard website: Michelle Jones, Petitioner v. Harlan Oakes, Commissioner of the Ames Division of Motor Vehicles, and Clara Brooks, Ames State Treasurer, Respondents -- involves a plaintiff's challenge to a state statute authorizing the production of specialty license plates displaying the words, "Choose Life." The plaintiff holds pro-choice beliefs, but cannot obtain a pro-choice license plate because the state has not authorized such a plate. The first issue asks whether the plaintiff has Article III standing to challenge the statute. The second addresses whether the statute violates the plaintiff's right to free speech under the First Amendment.  I cut-and-pasted that description, but as many times as I try to read it, I can't concentrate enough to read the whole paragraph and actually comprehend it.  The people on each team who talk are called "oralists."  That's the kind of thing their friends would probably make fun of them for if their friends aren't humorless law students.  "Ooh, you're an oralist...."

      Funny  urlLink Onion article  about the "dangers" of having a weblog.  This one really hit home for me.  My mom reads my weblog.  :)  It's prompting a lame attempt at humor:  Nine Events That Didn't Really Happen, but if they did I'd be pretty wary about posting them, since you never know who's reading.  1. That time that Professor Junklehopper called on me and I was high on LSD and pounced on him like a rabbit pouncing on a piece of lettuce, and I tore his shirt collar, he called security, and had me removed from class.  2. That time my study group session turned into a wild orgy, involving highlighters, flash cards, and something someone bought with a whole lotta Lexis points.   3. The ill-advised "bungee jumping off the library roof" incident.  4. The time I stole fourteen study guides from the bookstore (holding the cashier at felt-tip-pen-point), and then burned them all in an big bonfire outside the student center.  5. That source I cited wrong in a footnote.  6. My purchase of a Con Law outline from the creepy man who hangs out by the schoolyard trying to get us kids hooked on the study guides.  He's scary, dude.  7. That time I tried "skimming" for the first time.  8. When my friend dared me to take a practice exam, and I couldn't just do one, and stayed up for 72 hours straight on a practice exam binge that ended in disaster when I... ran out of practice exams.  9. Five words: "Review session, machine gun, messy"

      I was eating a Stonyfield Farms yogurt this morning (Maple Vanilla flavor -- it sounds weird but it's really good), and on the lid there was a message about a contest they're having.  Something like: "Send us a healthy version of your favorite recipe, that includes Stonyfield Farms yogurt, and you can win a trip to a cooking school somewhere."  Which, of course, as I sat down in Constitutional Law class, got me thinking about the worst possible recipes I could think of that would incorporate yogurt.  A few ideas:  1. Veal Parmesan & Yogurt.  Cover the veal with cheese, tomato sauce, and three cups of yogurt, preferably strawberry-flavored, although lemon will work as well.  Bake in an oven until the yogurt turns brown.  2. Yogurt Shrimp Fried Rice.  In a wok, mix white rice, soy sauce, bits of scrambled egg, assorted vegetables, shrimp bits, and lots and lots of yogurt.  Stir-fry until well-mixed.  Add soy sauce to taste.   3. KFC+Y.  Buy a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken.  Pour yogurt (again, fruit flavors work best) over the top.  Enjoy.  4. Tuna Salad, Yogurt-style.  Mix tuna salad as you might normally.  Instead of mayonnaise, use coffee-flavored yogurt.  Spread onto un-rolled fruit roll-ups.  Makes a delicious lunch.  5. Yogurt Cheez Doodles.  Dip Cheez Doodles in yogurt.  Enjoy.  Perhaps someone else has some better ideas.

      Exams are coming soon!  Well, not that soon, but soon enough.  Try out these exciting practice exam hypotheticals.  1. Criminal Law.  You are a fan of a professional basketball team.  After the game, one of their star players (KB) comes up to you and asks you if you would like to accompany him to his hotel room.  Events ensue.  Should KB go to jail?  2. Civil Procedure.  You are driving from New York to California with a young woman trapped in your trunk.  She cries out for help at least once in every state you pass.  As you reach California, you encounter a newly-elected politician (AS).  He opens the trunk.  Events ensue.  Can the woman sue you in federal court?  Can she sue AS in federal court?  3. Constitutional Law.  You are a clerk to Justice Thomas.  You find a pubic hair on your Coke can.  What do you do?   Other random notes on a not-that-exciting day:  1. When I was walking to class today I saw a real live skunk wandering around the campus. 2. I think cauliflower is a strange-looking vegetable. 3. Even though it's a little while (okay, a fairly long while, coming up on 1 AM here...) after midnight, I'm going to change the time on this post to 11:59pm Monday. 4. I am upset that I missed tonight's episode of "Average Joe"

      If you *really* want to read about the substance of the environmental law debate I saw here on Thursday, I have an article that'll probably make it into the Harvard Law Record later this week which I'll link to, and some previews of the actual content (quotes from the participants regarding Bush's policies) over  urlLink here .  But I figured it was worth a post on the oddest / funniest moment:  Assistant Secretary of the Interior Lynn Scarlett was talking about the Bush administration and how it's trying to cooperate with industry in order to develop environmental policies, and find ways to get stuff accomplished without necessarily penalizing businesses. She drew an analogy to raising children:  You want to get them to behave through encouragement and role modeling, she said, although of course sometimes you have to get out the sticks and punish."  Silence.  Awkward chuckle.  She got a confused look on her face and then realized what she'd said.   "Not with children, I dont mean. my daughter will vouch that I never used sticks.  Ha.

      Another review of Barman (see my review from last Monday) over  urlLink here  at the usually excellent  urlLink Wings and Vodka .  I like his review better than mine, to be honest.  He gets at all the stuff that's wrong with it; I spent too much of my review trying to justify why I read the book in one sitting.  He also could have paid $10 less than what he did if he'd gotten it on Half.com like I did, and that may have made him like it more.  I still think there's some good stuff in Barman about taking the bar and going through interviews... but there's way too much filler about the girls who can't keep their hands off of him and the crumbling concrete walls in his apartment.  Also, a real brief comment over at  urlLink JD2B  about "Brush With The Law," which I wrote a little bit about  urlLink way back here .  And, to complete today's survey of what other people are writing about,  urlLink Waddling Thunder  has a multi-part series on how his interviews went.  Especially if you have any interest in working in London, which I believe is in a foreign country somewhere, you should check it out.

      Some better stuff about hazing, mixed with some more thoughts on the Law Review Drinking Game from earlier this week... combined into an 800-word extravaganza.  Some new stuff here, but some will sound familiar.  Hazed and Confused  I've been a victim of hazing.  The "forced physical activity" of having to read the anti-hazing statute a half-dozen times, causing me "extreme mental stress" and "extended deprivation of rest."  For a law school, they've written an awfully vague statute if you ask me.  "Exposure to the weather" can count as hazing.  There's always some sort of weather, even nice weather.  Any activity that meets outside - or inside, with a window open - I've been hazed!  "Forced consumption of any food?"  Come on, every single student organization on campus is in violation of that one.  On day one, the Jewish Law Students Association (known for last year's unfortunate "you must eat that pork!" initiations festival that caused quite an uproar) had a bagel brunch.  I wouldn't say they forced anyone to eat the bagels, but they did suggest it a number of times, and with some conviction behind it.  I could easily see a 1L claiming he was coerced against his will.  "...likely to adversely affect the physical health...." Law review.  "[E]xtended deprivation of sleep."  Law review.  "...or extended isolation."  Law review.  "Forced calisthenics."  There goes every intramural sport.  Uh, all two of them.  "Branding."  There goes anyone doing anything with Lexis, Westlaw, or Bar-Bri.  Ha.  I think Student Health Services is in violation every time they write a prescription, the cafeteria every time they poison the food, and any sort of competition at all is clearly a violation of the  prohibition against "beating."  One of my professors forces us to bring the casebook to class every day.  It's heavy!  I've saved the best for last, though: these law journals we've got are all in gross violation of the hazing statute.  "Forced consumption of any... other substance."  Like a footnote?  Like the Bluebook?  "Forced physical activity."  Mass subcites?  Fight the power.  We're all being hazed like nobody's business.  But we know now.  Because they made us read the statute.  All of them.  Multiple times.  And cite-check it for accuracy.  If these law reviews are going to violate the law, at least they ought to be able to turn it into a game of some sort.  Make it fun to break state statutes.  I suggest the adoption of a "law review drinking game" in the research room of the library during each mass subcite:  Take one sip for every "id."  Two sips for every "supra."  Three sips every time the author uses a Latin phrase just for effect (inter what?).  Four sips for every page that's entirely footnote without a single line of text.  Five sips for every quote inside a parenthetical inside a quote inside a parenthetical.  Six sips for every misquoted source.  Seven sips for every generic web citation (see, The Internet).  Eight sips for every point cite to a page that simply doesn't exist.  Nine sips for every time the reference librarian is able to assist with whatever difficulty you might be encountering.  Oh, wait, that never happens.  Of course, this whole game could be played with coffee, inside one of the bath-sized spill-proof mugs the library gives us at the beginning of the year.  Fill that up and you could take fourteen sips for each and every word you pass, and still be drinking from it a week from now.  I filled mine up with water.  My water bill doubled.  (Do we pay water bills?  Does anyone pay water bills?  Or is water just one of those things that's free, like illegal cable TV, or music files.  I have no idea.)  I think final exams may be illegal under the hazing statute, actually.  Writing them is certainly a "forced physical activity," and surely they cause some people "extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation of sleep."  "Or extended isolation" in the library.  Or in the dorms.  Heck, the dorms alone are pretty adverse to anyone's well-being.  Down with the dorms.  Down with finals.  Down with hazing.  Want to join my new club, AHALSA (pronounced "cough, sneeze!")?  It stands for the Anti-Hazing Law Students Association (duh!).  All you have to do to join is stand outside for 36 hours, doing pushups, eating walnuts, drinking  lemonade, taking vitamins, while baking a cake (that gets the "whipping" and "beating" involved - you see where I'm going here), and advertising a leading type of dish detergent ("branding") on the toothpicks holding open your eyelids.  I think that just about covers the whole statute.  We're meeting tomorrow on some public or private property somewhere.  For a mass subcite.

      A 1L friend told me he's started to think about what to do this summer.  The topic unleashed a bunch of unsolicited advice from me.  I figure there's no better place for my unsolicited advice than right here.  First, a caveat -- if you go to a law school where the job choices really are different for people who work at a firm 1L summer versus people who don't, then you can probably take all of this with a grain of salt.  Obviously, the math is different if what you do is really going to determine job offers as a 2L.  I think here we're fortunate and lucky enough that most reasonable things that anybody would do over the summer are all seen as fine by employers and don't hurt in the 2L search as long as there's a compelling story behind it and a rational reason.  I don't know if that's true everywhere, so I recognize this advice may have limited application.  Second, a disclosure -- I didn't work at a law firm last summer.  I think there are some great reasons to try and work at a law firm 1L summer.  My feeling was that since I knew I was going to be doing that 2L summer, I wanted to use 1L summer to do something else, something that would introduce me to another thing I could do with my law degree, and give me an experience and connections and skills that I wasn't just going to duplicate the following summer.  That said:  I look at the summer after 1L year as an opportunity to leverage your year of law school into spending ten weeks doing something you really feel has the potential to have an impact in what you really, really, really want to end up doing with your life, whatever that might be.  I feel like too many people approach it as "what OUGHT I spend the summer doing?" and they end up doing something they're not really passionate about or even that interested in.  They go to a default option.  I see nothing wrong with ending up at a law firm.  But if you know you're going to end up at a law firm 2L summer, then the best reason, in my mind, to go to a law firm 1L summer is -- and it's a great reason, and a reason I'm sure tons of people have and that's great, really: You are absolutely passionate about the law and feel like law firm work is definitely something you think you're interested in.  You know you want to work at a law firm, and can't think of anything else you'd genuinely rather spend your summer doing.  When you consider different kinds of law you may want to practice, or, broader, different things you may want to do with your life, it all comes down to different things that different law firms do, and you want to use this summer to try some of them out and start to narrow the field and get a sense of where you want to end up in the long-term and this is really what's motivating your summer search.  That's a fine overall reason, I think.  No arguments from me.  BUT.  Reasons that sound really good, and in a lot of cases are really good, but I will try and counter at least a little bit: (1) The money -- in whatever financial situation you're in, that trumps everything else in your head.  It's a fair reason, but realize -- working at a firm after graduation, you will earn so much freakin' money that the $24K is a pittance and will turn out not to have mattered all that much and not to have been worth wasting a summer on.  It's all coming back in tuition anyway -- yes, it will do a great job in reducing your loans, but with the lawyer salary, you can pay back the loans.  The money's a good reason to work at a firm, I can't deny that.  But is the money worth passing up other things you may be more passionate about?  Just ask the question -- I know for a lot of people it is, and that's totally fair;  (2) there are more than two locations you really truly think you may genuinely want to be -- because if it's just 2 you can split your 2L summer -- and, more than anything else, you want to check out location #3.  My response: that's great.  But there's no reason why that has to be at a firm.  You can do all sorts of things in that city, whatever city it is.  Reasons that suck: (1) It'll look good on your resume.  My response, at least here: Go talk to some 2Ls.  Firms don't really seem to have cared all that much what people did last summer, as long as you have a good reason for whatever it was, and can articulate it, or at least make something up that sounds compelling.  (2)  All of my friends are working at firms.  If all of your friends kill themselves when they get a B in Civ Pro, will you kill yourself too?  You go to law school, that's good enough.  No one will think you're an inferior being because you pass up the chance to spend an extra summer using Westlaw.  SO: my advice would be to think about what you'd really like to be, if you could be anything at all -- and use this summer -- leverage the fact you're a law school student -- to see if you can take a real step towards getting there.  If you work at a firm without a really compelling reason to do so, you're wasting the summer because you'll be doing nothing you won't be able to do next year.  If you do "immigration law" at a non-profit just because the public interest office publishes a big thick guide and you figure that sounds like something that people won't look at you funny for doing, then you're wasting your summer. But if you decide, hey, I really like the law, and I really am passionate about immigration and helping to change the system and I want to get involved, and see what these organizations do, and there's nothing I'd rather try this summer, then that's great.  You've found it.  The key, I think, is no regrets.  Don't be forced into something that's going to make you feel silly when it turns out it really didn't do anything for you and you wasted the whole summer.  If you're dying to see how government law stuff works, lots of cool stuff; district attorney's offices; non-profit stuff; lifeguarding.  It's all about what your passions are, or at least that's how I see it.  Of course, I may be totally wrong.

      If you liked the 3000-word version of my A-to-Z Guide to Callback Interviews from earlier in the week, you'll love the 1000-word version that ran in the  urlLink Harvard Law Record .  Check it out if you dare.  Tonight at a cappella rehearsal, we had to discuss Harvard's anti-hazing statute.  There's a law, it seems, that requires all student organizations here to sign an anti-hazing pledge.  Because hazing is obviously a big problem for a cappella groups.  And the Jewish Law Students Association (eat that pork!  you must eat that pork!).  And the technology law journal.  And moot court.  From the statute:   269:17. Hazing; organizing or participating; hazing defined  Whoever is a principal organizer or participant in the crime of hazing, as defined herein, shall be punished by a fine of not more than three thousand dollars or by imprisonment in a house of correction for not more than one year, or both such fine and imprisonment.  The term 'hazing' as used in this section and in sections eighteen and nineteen, shall mean any conduct or method of initiation into any student organization, whether on public or private property, which willfully or recklessly endangers the physical or mental health of any student or other person. Such conduct shall include  whipping, beating, branding, forced calisthenics, exposure to the weather, forced consumption of any food, liquor, beverage, drug, or other substance, or any other brutal treatment or forced physical activity  which is likely to adversely affect the physical health, or safety of any such student or other person, or which subjects such student or other person to extreme mental stress, including extended deprivation of sleep or rest or extended isolation.   "Exposure to the weather" is awfully vague.  There's always some sort of weather.  Making someone enjoy a beautiful day: hazing.  Asking you to eat the "welcome to our church" cookies: hazing.  Making you hold the door for the person behind you ("forced physical activity"): hazing.  Better examples of stupid things that would count as hazing: coming later when I'm more creative.

      I went to Harvard's "Health Fair" this afternoon.  According to the flyer: "Harvest of Health: Harvard Law School Health Fair."  It was like a job fair, a room filled with tables, each from a different health service -- physical therapy and orthopedics, pharmacy, dental, skin care, emotional health, primary care medicine, travel health, eye care, nutrition matters, massage therapy, "maximizing your wellness," yoga and meditation, and "Bonus -- Flu Vaccinations."  I'm not completely clear on what exactly was being sold or advertised -- I don't think they need a Fair to let me know that if I feel sick I should go to the doctor, and if my teeth hurt, I should go to the dentist.  Nevertheless -- there was lots and lots of free stuff there, so it was very very cool.  They had a table at the entrance -- "complimentary pumpkins -- take one."  So now I have a pumpkin.  It's kind of moldy.  I guess it didn't go to the doctor.  Lesson learned.  There was a "make your own trail mix" table with raisins, M&Ms, brown sugar, granola, and pumpkin seeds.  There was a popcorn machine and little cups of popcorn.  There were Halloween cookies and candy corn (real healthy, that candy corn -- great for teeth!).  There was hot apple cider.  They gave out all sorts of stuff too -- earplugs (for exams?), eyeglass cleaning cloth, stress ball, bag of granola, travel toothbrush, rain poncho, cough drops, mouth guard, chapstick, a band-aid dispenser, and a pen.  Again, I don't know what they were selling, or why this event was necessary -- but I give it an A+ for the free food, and an A++ for the free giveaways.  Whatever they intended to accomplish by doing this, I hope they decide to do it again soon.  This is what my tuition dollars are paying for.

      UPN Shifts Garfield Mini-series to Cinemax  MENTOR, OHIO (AP) -- Barraged by accusations from conservatives that it was distorting the legacy of a president, UPN announced Tuesday it was pulling "The Garfields" miniseries off the air.   UPN insisted it was not bowing to pressure about portions of the script, but that the decision was made after seeing the finished film.   "Although the miniseries features impressive production values and acting performances (especially by star Drew Carey in his role as President Garfield), we believe it does not present a balanced portrayal of the Garfields for UPN and its audience of approximately eighteen viewers," the network said in a statement.   Supporters of the former president, who was shot while in office, and died four months later, are concerned the miniseries contains numerous inaccuracies.   Among the inaccuracies:  *The movie presents Garfield as still alive, and currently living in a suburb outside Detroit, set to turn 172 years old later this month.  *The United States does not, and did not in President Garfield's time, contain 74 states, including "West Dakota," "Arkolorado," "Old York," "Trout-land," and "Canada."  *President Garfield did not have three eyes.  *While President Garfield was indeed shot, and did indeed contract blood poisoning from the unsterilized fingers of upwards of a dozen doctors probing his wound and searching for the bullet, and these doctors did indeed turn a three-and-a-half inch wound into a twenty-inch canal of oozing pus, President Garfield's middle name was not Abraham, it was Abram.  *President Garfield did not have an addiction to Internet porn.   The former president's great-great-great-grandson, Wally Garfield, told UPN's "Good Morning Anyone Who Accidentally Left the TV on last night's 'Blind Date' episode and is just now waking up" on Tuesday that he wanted UPN to "show James Garfield for what he was: fairly inconsequential and merely a footnote in history."   "What they've done is try and strip the assassination of Garfield away," he said. "The great thing about my great-great-great-grandfather was his assassination."   "The Garfields" had been considered a major cog in UPN's November sweeps programming, along with its new reality-TV series, "The Bryants." It had been scheduled to air on Sunday -- UPN's most-watched night of the week, with an average of 46 viewers.   (In case you don't know what the heck I'm talking about, see this  urlLink New York Times article  about CBS pulling the Ronald Reagan miniseries.  I'm trying to make fun of that situation.  If you needed me to say that, I've probably failed miserably.)  P.S. I make fun of lawyers chasing after Staten Island Ferry crash victims over at  urlLink En Banc .

      I just finished reading " urlLink Barman " by Alex Wellen.  It's a memoir about a Temple Law student's search for a job at a big law firm, and his experience studying for and taking the Bar Exam and his first few months at a firm.  I felt like the book could be divided into two parts -- there were the parts he talked about law student stuff, and there were the parts he talked about his girlfriends and his parents and his search for an apartment and the rash he got from ripping up the concrete to replace the apartment's walls.  I found the law student parts interesting, mostly because I could relate.  He's a good writer.  His description of the job search was good.  His description of studying for the bar exam rang true and gave me a clue as to what I'll be experiencing eighteen months from now.  My only criticism of that part of the book is that it was really just a description, and wasn't filled with too many insights about the process or interesting observations.  Nothing extraordinary happened to him.  He found a job without all that much trouble, he didn't fall into a hole in the Earth on the way to the bar exam... actually a refreshing difference from Brush With The Law, where the authors lived ridiculously atypical law student lives... but it didn't make his story all that fascinating.  Although, like I said, it's well-written.  The rest of the book I wasn't as compelled or engaged by.  Obviously, law students will identify with the law school stuff more... but the parts about his girlfriends, about his parents, about his brother, about his trip to Europe with his roommate, and their apartment search, and the rats that live in the bathroom... again, well-written -- but very much like reading his journal.  It was a description of his life, without lots of insight or thoughts about the world or deeper realizations.  I had trouble caring, a little bit.  And I kept wondering why everywhere he went he'd meet another girl who's crazy about him.  Which made me wonder if part of this was wishful thinking on his part.  But even if not, again, well-written -- and I read the book in one sitting even though I really hadn't planned to, because I did find it engaging -- but not extraordinary.  In the epilogue, he writes about how he left the law firm to go start a TV show on the TechTV network.  But not too many details on why, about why law firm life didn't work for him, about the decision to leave, about what he'd learned about himself.  And that was missing throughout the book -- the introspection, the reason to have written it.  I enjoyed the book, but I guess I don't know why it needed to be written, what the story is that he needed to tell, and why he needed to tell it.  But, like I keep saying, it's well-written, and I found myself not wanting to put it down.  So I can't complain too much.

      Classes felt kind of long today.  Possibly because for the past week I've been used to having my time broken up into 30-minute chunks.  Well, sort of 30-minute chunks.  30 minutes, move seats, and repeat pretty much everything.

      I just got back to Cambridge from wherever it was I was for the week (I think I gave it away in Saturday night's mega-post, not that it's really a matter of national security.  I mean, if I was interviewing in Dubuque, maybe I'd be giving something away by revealing, but I talked about the nice views from the 57th floor, mentioned some sort of blackout that happened not that long ago, and I took the Delta Shuttle to get there.  Even the answers on "Who Wants to be a Millionaire" are harder to figure out.).  A couple of random notes:  >>On the Delta Shuttle, they gave out "Atkins Breakfast Bars" in lieu of actual food.  I don't understand the recent "food in a bar" phenomenon -- PowerBars, Luna Bars, those oddly-conceived milk-and-cereal bars, and now apparently M&M cookie bars that I just saw a commercial for -- since they all taste like densely packed sugar and offer none of the enjoyment that, say, actual food does.  If we're transitioning to an "eating solely for nutrition" culture from the much more pleasurable "eating because food tastes good" regime, I want out.  This "creamy cinnamon bun" flavored Atkins Bar was truly wretched.  It may have been the worst thing I've ever eaten.  It was basically a thick layer of solidified yogurt covering a dense and chalky center made of cinnamon, bran, and other assorted brown ingredients.  The brown ingredient it tasted like was [censored by the Committee for Polite Language].  If I want nutrients, I'll swallow a vitamin.  If I want food, I want actual food.  I thought the Atkins Diet was about steak and bacon and sour cream.  Not "creamy cinnamon bun" flavored garbage.  The rest of the flight was fine.  No complaints about the Delta Shuttle except they're giving away nutrient logs instead of actual food.  >>I've been listening to the Phil Collins songs off the new "Brother Bear" soundtrack.  And I like them.  That's sad, isn't it.  "Look Through My Eyes" is catchy stuff.

      It still feels odd to me that now, less than two months into year 2 of law school, pretty much everyone has a job in place for when we graduate, barring any terrible summer experience.  That's a long time to not have to read for class.  :)  No, I'll read for class.  Really, I will.  Speaking of terrible summer experiences, I came across a very funny post from Infirmation's Greedy Associates lawyer message board as I was researching firms, titled "20+ examples of what not to do.".  See it  urlLink here .  The highlights (some editing for clarity and grammar):   3. Drunken belligerent [summer associate] that picked fight at Yankees game which resulted in other participant's arrest and subsequent beating by NYC's finest.   5. [Summer associate]. Choked another associate at firm softball or basketball game.  8. [Summer associate].  During his summer, when he asked what it would take not to get a permanent offer at end of summer, was told that he "would have to suffer a mental breakdown."  Proceeded to have mental breakdown. Was found sleeping under his desk at night and aimlessly wandering streets during the day when he was supposed to be at work.  9. [Summer associate] accepted offer at two firms in NYC. However, he did not inform firms that he was splitting his summer. Each day, he would alternate between the two offices and would check his messages from the other firm. Eventually the firms caught on and he got fired from both offices.   11. Moo Shoo girl. At lunch on callback interview, mistook a moo shoo pancake as a hand towel and proceeded to wipe her face in front of startled associates. Did not receive offer. Mid 90s.   21. [Associate] was caught masturbating in a conference room by some poor cleaning lady who ran screaming for security. Ha.

      Happy New Year.  I was going to write a semi-serious piece on my New Years Resolutions and law school and something like that -- but first I need to actually think about that stuff so I have something to say.  In the meantime...  CREATE YOUR OWN EXAM QUESTION: Torts Edition  Instructions: Pick one each from column A, column B, column C, and column D.  Put them together, and voila!  Your very own exam question!  COLUMN A  Joan Smith, a 45-year-old file clerk from Alexandria, Virginia Your mom Zeptar from outer space Grandma Michael Jackson My husband A government official working in his governmental capacity My son's third-grade teacher, while high on crack A talking dog A magic eighteen-wheeler  COLUMN B Spills hot coffee on Murders Gives an exploding toaster to Breaks the leg of Lands a spaceship in the backyard of Molests Intentionally inflicts emotional distress on Runs over Feeds copius amounts of McDonalds food to Sneezes on  COLUMN C Herself / himself / itself Your mom The ghost of Oliver Wendell Holmes Fifty Cent Santa Claus Karl Rove The family dog A room full of Jehovas Witnesses Alvin and the Chipmunks God  COLUMN D Who pays? What would a judge do? Write a fifteen-page memo describing the legal issues. Imagine you are the clerk to Justice Ginsburg when the case comes before the court. Argue for the plaintiff. List all conflict pairs and resolve the relevant issues. Distinguish this case from the relevant cases we have read in the course and decide a ruling. Discuss policy implications for deciding the case in either direction. Dump all of your torts knowledge onto the page and somehow pretend you've answered the question.  You have three hours.  The exam begins now.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  has some recipes on his weblog for risotto and dumplings, in an attempt to present ideas for a diet consisting of smaller portions of really good food.  His posts have inspired me to share what I have seen in my year and a half at law school.  If you've ever looked around a law school campus and wondered how you could look like the students there -- frazzled, tense, and borderline paranoid -- now, for the first time, you can learn the secrets to the physical side of law school success.  Why more workout tapes are filmed on law school campuses than anywhere else.*  Why the Abercrombie & Fitch catalog was filmed on Harvard Law School's campus.**  Why lawyers live longer than virtually anyone else.***  * = Not true. ** = Definitely not true. *** = Nope.  The (Secret and Amazing) Law School Nutritional Plan: "For A New You to Sue!"  BREAKFAST Seven cups of coffee, black (For extra benefit, make the coffee too hot, spill it on yourself, and sue somebody) Institutional donut, glazed  MID-MORNING SNACK Twizzlers (from vending machine) Eight more cups of coffee, black. Caffeine pill Crack  LUNCH Pre-wrapped cafeteria sandwich, extra mayo Three 20-oz. bottles of Diet Coke Institutional donut, glazed Ballpoint pen, by accident   MID-AFTERNOON SNACK Potato Chips (from vending machine) Four more bottles of Diet Coke The bitten-off head of a little baby bird  DINNER Cup O'Noodles (Beef flavored), uncooked (boiling water takes too much time) Bowl O'Cheese, for calcium "Coffee Cola" -- four cups coffee mixed with three bottles Diet Coke, plus five tablespoons Red Bull and a shot of Vodka  Repeat DINNER as necessary throughout the evening  WEEKEND BONUS MEALS:  "Law School Salad" -- the weeds growing outside your window, use the window moisture as dressing (no time to cook or go to the store -- need to study!)  "Mystery Meat" -- either from cafeteria or from dumpster in front of the library that you can quickly scour in your rush to make it to the circulation desk before the old exam answers are stolen and secretly altered by a classmate  "Recruiting Bonus" -- all the mini egg rolls you can eat without retching, at any of eighteen receptions per evening  "Recruiting Bonus 2" -- all the "Coffee Cola" you can drink, FREE at these receptions!  "Recruiting Bonus 3" -- rejection letters on toast.  Delicious.  "Recruiting Bonus 4" -- blood from a lawyer's eyes.  Just wait until they've been awake for 60 hours straight and it's a vampire's feast!  AND FINALLY, THE EXERCISE PORTION OF THE PLAN:  Turning a page in a casebook burns 0.04 calories.  Read a 1000-page casebook and burn 40 calories!  Amazing!

      I saw "Stuck On You" with a friend this evening.  The Farrelly brothers movie about the conjoined twins.  Eh.  There were definitely funny lines.  There were a good number of times I laughed out loud.  But it just didn't hang together.  The second half dragged.  It was scattershot -- some jokes hit, some jokes missed, and there wasn't an overall solid coherence to it.  Or at least that's my opinion.  Five Things I Would Not Want To Be Stuck On  1. The fence of a house about to get hit by a tornado 2. A fat person running on a treadmill  3. A bed of nails 4. The roof of a retractable dome stadium as it's retracting 5. An about-to-explode grenade

      All of the movies I've seen this year (I'm going by release dates -- probably a couple of movies released at the end of 2002 I saw in 2003), and the order which I'd rank them.  There is no reason for this post, but just in case you're curious.  I didn't think I'd seen this many until I made the list, although I guess 18 movies in a year really isn't a crazy amount, especially since I think I saw 5 movies in 2 weeks at one point this summer.  I generally try to only go to movies I think I'll like (so my choices probably say as much about me as my rankings), but I would say I only liked the top 11 of the 18, and #10 and #11 are borderline.  1. Spellbound 2. Shattered Glass 3. Bend It Like Beckham 4. Elf 5. School of Rock 6. A Mighty Wind 7. American Wedding 8. Camp 9. Johnny English 10. Seabiscuit 11. Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star  12. American Splendor 13. Bruce Almighty 14. Intolerable Cruelty 15. Thirteen 16. Legally Blonde 2 17. Better Luck Tomorrow 18. The Matrix Revolutions  Heck, just because I'm curious how many movies I saw last year, while I'm at it, this would be my list for movies released in 2002:  1. Antwone Fisher 2. About a Boy 3. The Emperor's Club 4. Moonlight Mile 5. Spider-Man 6. The Rookie 7. Undercover Brother 8. Bowling for Columbine 9. Mr. Deeds 10. Hollywood Ending 11. John Q 12. 40 Days and 40 Nights 13. Kissing Jessica Stein 14. Sweet Home Alabama 15. About Schmidt 16. My Big Fat Greek Wedding 17. The Good Girl 18. Two Weeks Notice 19. Orange County 20. Tadpole 21. Igby Goes Down 22. Roger Dodger 23. Chicago  I'd draw my Like/Didn't Like line right below #16 I guess, although #13-#16 could probably just as easily be on the other side of the line.

      A quick song for the new year.  To the tune of "Auld Lang Syne."  Should all the cases be forgot  and never brought to mind?  Should all the casebooks be destroyed  in days of post-test time  In post-test time, my dear,  In post-test time,  We'll burn the outlines to a crisp  In post-test time  Should all the rules that we had learned Each unit we'll discard Forget the hours lecture spent In post-test time  And take your notes, my trusted friend  Delete the whole damn file We'll toss the syllabus away In post-test time

      A Christmas / Chanukah Gift for my readers (well, one of my readers, anyway).    I've got a 2004 Vault Guide to Law Firms that I don't need, and that no one who uses Amazon seems to want to give me $20 for.  $34.95 retail value.  And it's actually still sealed in the plastic -- I didn't realize when I bought it that we get online access through the Harvard career services website, and I ended up not even opening the paper copy.  So this is brand new, and if someone is willing to pay shipping, it's a sunk cost for me and I'm happy to give it away and make someone happy.  If you want it, here's the plan: send me an e-mail with the subject line Free Vault Guide.  I'll give it a few days, depending on the response, and I'll randomly choose one (the accounting firm of My Mom will audit the drawing, since I'll do it before I head back to school next weekend).

      I'm back in NY, after what could most charitably be described as a very comprehensive security checkpoint at Charles De Gaulle airport in Paris that delayed the flight by 3 hours.  I have no problem with added security, I really don't, but I'd never seen it quite like this before.  Once everyone was checked in and ready to board, they had the 200+ passengers line up, and one by one they emptied all of our carry-on luggage and re-packed it, did very thorough full body metal detector swipes ("can you take off your belt?  can you take off your watch?  can you take out your fillings?"), and scanned our shoes specially.  This took 3 hours.  Sloooow.  But the plane didn't blow up, so it was all worth it.  I had the good luck to encounter an overly-friendly insane man to help make the time pass more quickly.  I tend not to find myself making conversation with strangers very often.  My grandmother is very good at this.  I never really feel comfortable starting to talk to a stranger.  But anyway, this guy saw me reading an English-language magazine (the British version of GQ, actually -- I figured when else will I get a chance to sample British magazines at no greater cost than their American counterparts, available with the 20 Euros I still had left at the airport's international newsstand) and took to opportunity to ask me if I thought we were at the right gate -- I did -- and then he launched into a long discussion of his life.  He was engaged a while ago, but it didn't work out.  Marriage is supposed to fun, he said, and they fought too much.  He might go teach photography at the University of Texas, but they would have to offer him a lot of money.  I didn't get the impression they've heard of this plan yet.  He is a photographer.  He carried a camera.  He wouldn't stop talking.  He just finished taking pictures on a movie set.  He went to Paris for half a week to write a screenplay.  Screenplays don't get written in half a week, I didn't say.  He met a woman at the airport (before meeting me) whose daughter is a singer.  He's going to write a part for this woman's daughter in his movie, and then she'll become a famous singer and he'll become a famous director.  And then he's going to move to Alaska.  With his fortune.  And buy a house there.  And eat fish.  Have I tortured you enough?  But on the plane, I got to sit next to a rude French woman and the husband she tortures, which was much more entertaining.  She got on the plane -- I had the aisle seat, they had the window and the middle -- and said something to me in French.  I figured out what she meant and got up to let her through.  She gestured to the overhead bins, screaming at her husband, and he tried to cram their bag in where there wasn't enough space.  He failed.  So then she pulled someone else's bag out -- a girl's knapsack, sitting behind me, and threw it to floor, stuffed her bag in, and then tried to cram the girl's bag back up there.  She thought she succeeded.  Three seconds after she let go, the bag fell and hit the girl in the face.  The French woman screamed at her husband some more.  No one apologized to the girl.  They stuffed her bag back up there.  Then the rude French woman argued with her husband about (I'm guessing) who would get the middle seat.  Guess who?  Poor husband.  A bit of the way into the takeoff, they turned the lights off.  I was reading so I turned my light on.  She then did her best impression of Al Gore in a presidential debate, sighing and squirming and trying to shield herself from this awful light with her magazine, making uncomfortable faces and noises until I just shut it off.  The food came around and they asked whether we wanted chicken or beef.  She said beef, her husband said chicken, and she yelled at him -- I assume that she was saying how awful chicken is, or something to that effect -- I kept hearing the words for chicken and beef but could pick up nothing else.  Neither one ate their food, and she said something about Americans.  Four trips to the bathroom later, including one where she literally stomped on my pillow as I moved to let her pass, we were about to land.  Her husband asked me if I was from New York -- it turned out he lived here for a year when he was young and could speak some English.  His wife said something.  "She says these are the ugliest buildings she's ever seen," he told me.  Welcome to America.  I hope the taxi driver rips you off.  It's actually too bad that these people were my last impression of France, because overall I didn't find the people any ruder than Americans, any smellier, any more worthy of mockery.  They were fine to me, I guess -- although I didn't understand anything they said so who knows.  They were notably less obese than Americans, but that may be because all of the subway stations involve tremendous amounts of stairs, and really the whole city is a walking city and everyone walks.  So they get exercise.  And I guess portions are smaller, although certainly I found them to be well bigger than ample and especially when each meal has fourteen courses.  The rude plane people are overshadowed by the relatives I visited for Christmas Eve dinner last night -- my cousin's wife's brother and his family, who are French.  They were extraordinarily hospitable and pleasant, although for all I know they could have been making fun of me all night in their secret language code (I mean French, obviously).  The food was unbelievable, including oysters and foie gras (two French delicacies widely available but expensive it seems).  And a traditional French Christmas log cake (bouche), which, if compared to the American fruit cake is like comparing a chia pet to the Wrigley Field outfield.  There are better analogies out there, I'm sure.  I am still full, 24 hours later.  Apologies for the week-long focus on France, if you didn't like it.  It's over now, and back to the usual stuff.  Although I'm hoping that the downturn in hits this week is because of the holidays and people not being online rather than due to people not wanting to hear every detail of my vacation.  Uh, maybe not.  Anyway, more fun soon.

      The 1L Course Primer, Part 7 of 6.  100 Words About... LEGAL WRITING  It doesn't really count as a course, so I didn't really give it a number.  Here, we learned how to use the Internet.  And what gets italicized in a footnote and what gets written in small-caps.  And how many lines we're allowed to put on a page in a legal brief, and what color the cover must be, and where the staple goes, and how many pixels are in a comma.  Legal writing is a lot more like regular writing than anyone wants to admit.  If you can regular-write, and regular-read the irregular-rules, you can surely legal-write.  Don't sweat it.

      Twenty-four hours from now, I'll be somewhere over Greenland.  I gave up my personal crusade to go to Paris and not visit the Louvre.  Mostly because it's raining.  I didn't actually buy a ticket and look at the exhibits, but I wandered around the lobby, looked at a map, walked around the gift shop, ate lunch in the cafeteria, checked out the famous Pyramid (it's lovely), and walked through the Louvre Mall, which features a Body Shop, Virgin Megastore, and 2 Swatch stores, or maybe just one with two entrances.  I know I sound silly going to Paris and not spending three days staring at the magnificent paintings and sculpture -- and I don't at all deny their magnificence -- but, like I said earlier in the week, I just don't feel like I get anything out of looking at paintings.  On an intellectual level I know I should, but for whatever reason I'd rather walk around a supermarket than an art gallery.  And so I searched out the nicest gourmet supermarket in Paris -- Le Grand Epicerie -- and wandered around for a while.  Fresh squeezed juice appears to be an American thing -- all of the fresh squeezed juice in the supermarket had English labels.  There was a stunning selection of refrigerated pastries that we just don't have -- charlottes and melbas and ednas (not ednas) -- as well as lots and lots of varieties of plain yogurt, but only a few varieties with fruit.  Lots of biscuits and chocolates and breads and jams and cheeses, obviously.  Not much frozen food.  Not really all that many different kinds of vegetables.  Lots of foie gras, but I think that was a function of the "gourmet" part of the supermarket.  A huge wine section.  Walking around the supermarket really was interesting.  This is why the travel book I write is going to sell fourteen copies and end up in the bargain bins a week after it's published.  Chapter 1. Supermarkets.  Chapter 2. Books, CDs, and the cheapest souvenirs the city has to offer.  Chapter 3. Street food.  Chapter 4. Magazine stands.  Chapter 5. Funny signs that wouldn't be funny if you actually spoke the language (today's observation: the copy shop sells Tampons!  [really]).  Sidebar, page 93. Museums, cathedrals, churches, monuments, and cemeteries, plus a small drawing of a monkey to fill up the blank space still left in the sidebar.  I pieced together another lunch of random parts today.  The theme was, "it's my last day in France, but I'm tired of French food, so let me get more creative."  At the Louvre Food Court, a magnificent 12-stall homage to the American suburban shopping mall, my choices were wide-ranging, from the Muffin Shop (there are no words for muffins or cookies in French -- they're American imports) to the Sushi Palace, to the Pyramid of Taco, to the Sicilian Pizza Jamboree (I'm making up these names, but the themes are accurate), to the Well-One-Of-These-Stalls-Should-Be-French-Since-You're-In-France Bistro, to the Hamburger Angioplasturie, to the Wok To The Louvre Chinese Buffet to the Pretend Indian Food.  I chose the Spanish Tapas stall, which looked really tasty.  And it was really tasty.  I had cold fish in a lemony vinegar sauce, and scallops in a tomatoey sauce.  2 appetizers.  Total cost, $5.  Excellent.  And an Orangina.  Because I really like Orangina.  Two hours later, while walking down a lovely 13th-century shopping street, I had gelato, which is probably not French.  Yogurt with mixed berries.  It was possibly the best thing I've eaten all week, no joke. And I've liked the food here.  But this was unbelievable.  Maybe it was just because it's a little warmer out today than it's been, and I'd been walking for a while... I don't think there's any explanation needed though -- it was just really, really good.  The best thing about what I've eaten today?  No bread.  I'm tired of bread.  There's too much dough in this cuisine.  It's either bread, or pastry, or quiche... everything's made of dough.  It's good dough, but a week of it is enough.  So -- I ended my tourist adventure by wandering around a street market, eating my gelato, and going into Disc King, a discount CD store that offered piles upon piles of Glen Campbell's Greatest Hits for $6 and the new Ronan Keating CD for $30.  And that's about it.  Then I went into the University Bookstore, looked at a couple of books of French comics that I did not understand, bought a small pen and pad to write down my observation that the copy shop was selling Tampons before I forgot, and got back on the metro.  Tonight I go with my cousins to a Christmas Eve dinner at someone's house, and then tomorrow I fly home.  Such has been Paris.

      The 1L Course Primer, Part 6 of 6.  100 Words About... CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  For me, Con Law wasn't a 1L course.  But for a lot of people it is, and I still need another day to fill, so it gets its own hundred words.  If you think the Supreme Court's decisions make sense, you won't after a semester of Con Law.  For every famous case the Supreme Court has heard, about abortion, or affirmative action, or school desegregation, or sodomy, you'll read a dozen others about banning out-of-state milk in plastic (but not cardboard) containers, or whether Maine can keep out foreign bait-fish.  There's a lot of constitutional law out there.  Have fun.

      We had dinner tonight with a family that's friends of my cousins -- a man and wife and their 18-year-old son who has grown up in France but is thinking about going to an American university.  I learned a bit about the French university and "grande ecole" system, which is different from ours.  This kid, for example, is in a transition year before he will have to take a test to see whether he can go to the prestigious grande ecoles or will have to settle for a much less prestigious university, the end result being that his fate will be determined to a much greater extent than it is here by this one test.  So his current program is structured much like a university here as far as coursework -- only there's a lot more of it... he's in class 35 hours a week plus homework, and the entire year enveloped with the pressure that he has to do well on this test at the end -- a content-based test as opposed to the more intelligence-aimed SAT.  Sounds like a fairly unpleasant situation, actually.  Not sure I have a point to make here, but I thought it was interesting an I'd share...

      An attempt.  This may not hit the mark.  Twas the night before the night before the night before Christmas And all through the house The presents were sleeping For kids and for spouse They were wrapped in the closet With ribbons so tight They were battery-powered But not on tonight They were resting and ready In places they hide For gift-getting people With mouths open wide To tear off all the paper And throw out the card To be shaken and rattled Felt if soft or if hard So the presents were resting As you were asleep And you hear little patters From small little feet As the closet gets opened The wrapping gets torn Guess it can't wait three days Until Christmas Day's morn But there's just disappointment The feet go away There are no presents there For this creature that day He comes back in the morning You wake with the fog And you see who was looking For gifts Was the dog.

      You'll notice I posted a Top 10 List this morning trying to somehow connect France to Law School.  So if the Paris reports aren't really your cup of tea (cup of the, in part-French), hopefully that (along with my daily 100 words about 1L classes) will keep you from being too annoyed at all the Paris talk.  Only 2 more days of Paris and then I have some year-end stuff in mind I'm playing with.  Today's observations:  1. Best evidence to check what the name of your shoe company means in another language before putting up a big sign advertising it: "Brothel Creeps shoes."  Really.  Brothel creeps.  I wish I'd had a camera.  2. Best evidence to check what the name of your toilet company means  in your own language  before writing it on your toilet: "Eclair" was the name of the manufacturer of one toilet I used today.  My immediate thought: [juvenile humor warning] I hesitate to ask what that would make a chocolate eclair...  2A. More toilet humor.  Note that toilet = bathroom here.  My cousin, who's from France, told me that if I was thirsty I could just get some water from the toilet.  She meant well.  3. I made Santa angry today.  I was looking around a gourmet food store (art museums I hate, but I can spend a half hour walking around looking at food...) and there was a man dressed as Santa handing out a small free gift to customers.  He passed me twice and gave me nothing.  The third time I pointed and looked at him.  He said something in French.  I shrugged.  He gave me one, but said some more things in French that sounded rude.  Oh well.  4. I made a cheese store employee angry today.  I walked into the cheese store, she said Bonjour, I said Bonjour, I realized the store wasn't that interesting, and I left.  She came after me and said something in French.  I said I didn't understand.  She said she wanted to know if I needed any help.  I said no, just looking.  She muttered something in French that sounded rude.  Oh well.  I didn't do anything wrong, I don't think.  5. I looked in a music store today (the theme of my day -- looking in stores -- is becoming pretty apparent, isn't it) where they had $5 CDs.  But these were not normal CDs.  They were all "Britney Spears songs as sung by Maria Smith, or some name that sounds much more European than that.  They had CDs like that for Britney, Christina Aguilera, U2, The Four Tops, the Bee Gees, Little Richard, Westlife, Robbie Williams, and more.  If they'd been $1 I probably would have bought one just out of curiosity.  My curiosity wasn't worth $5 though.  6. I went into a bakery and asked for an olive roll.  The man put it in a bag and gave it to the woman at the register.  She looked inside and said something, and I just nodded, and she gave it back to the man and he put a different roll in.  And I paid.  My first thought was that she'd seen some mold or something and was giving me a new one, which didn't sound very appetizing at all.  But then I started eating it and realized it had nuts, not olives.  So, I surmise: she must have said to me, "roll with nuts," and I nodded, and then she told the man he'd given me a roll with olives, not nuts, and so he switched it.  So, because I nodded, I ended up with a roll I didn't want.  Oh well.  Just a roll.  7. But speaking of olives, another store I went in (yes, this really is all I did today -- walked around parks, and went into stores -- and got completely lost in the Latin Quarter and not even my map could save me until I stumbled across a Metro station about a mile away from the one I thought I was near) had samples out of chocolate covered olives.  That sounds gross, and I doubted it when I saw the sign, even though the word for olive is "olive," but it was actually not bad.  Really.

      The 1L Course Primer, Part 5 of 6.  100 Words About... CIVIL PROCEDURE  Oh, man.  Civil Procedure is the least accessible 1L class you'll take.  Because we all have some idea of what a crime is, and what a contract is, but none of us (at least not me) has any clue that there are rules about what court you can sue someone in, and they depend on where you're from, and where he's from, and whether the case is about your car that rolled down a mountain from Vermont into New Hampshire.  Or the other way around.  Civ Pro is about court rules.  I'm not selling it very well here, am I?

      Excerpt from the popular travel guide, "Paris for the Easily Amused" (inspired by the utterly useless "Undiscovered Paris")  ...page 97  Secret #31: The tallest light post in Paris -- take the Metro to Rue d'Day Ouimet.  Turn south.  Walk three euros and seven degrees celsius until you find a narrow baguette.  Go three forward, take two back.  There, right in front of you, will be the tallest lightpost in Paris.  Rarely visited (it's criminal!), this attraction is stupendous.  The lightpost is 7 feet tall as compared with the normal 6-feet 9.  Astounding.  Budget 19 hours for this trip.

      Ten Ways Law School Is Probably Different In France  1. No classes between 11:30 and 2:30; mandatory 3-hour lunch; and the cafeteria food is really good 2. People don't line up to register, they just all sort of gather and push their way toward the front of the line 3. Instead of Torts they take Tortes 4. Boulangerie -- Law School -- Patisserie 5. Everyone wears a scarf to class 6. Instead of pizza at their meetings, student organizations serve crepes  7. Bri-Bar, Nexis Lexis, and LestWaw! 8. There are garbage cans but everyone just throws his trash on the ground (I'm beating this dead horse, I'm sorry) 9. The law school is next door to an art museum (everything here is next door to an art museum) 10. All of the classes are conducted in French

      Today I went with my cousins on a day trip to Beaune, a small town about two hours outside of Paris that makes wine but not traffic signals.  We got up at 6 AM to get to the Metro before 7 and to the fast train for out of town trips (3 letters -- stands for something -- but I can't remember.  I'm tempted to go for the easy joke and call it the STD, but I won't.  I'll just call it the train).  So we got to Beaune, after a transfer in Dijon, where the train station sold mustard in a rainbow of colors.  Pink mustard (red wine), white mustard (white wine), and green mustard (mold).  The station also had a magazine shop with an "international" section.  For some reason, Time and Premiere are the 2 American magazines they carried.  The Premiere sales rep should get a raise.  I bought neither mustard nor a magazine.  Beaune's train station is an unpleasant 15 minute walk from the town, which is actually surprisingly nice.  There were a whole bunch of nice gourmet food stores, patisseries, charcuteries, gourmanderies, and stores that sell scarves (neckwooleries).  Scarves are big in France.  There was also an odd looking cafe that said "Non-Stop Restaurant."  They were right.  No one stopped.  It was empty.  We went first to a hospital from the 16th century that's been turned into a museum.  It was part of Beaune's Museum Trifecta, all available for one price, ostensibly to get you to forget that you hate museums and con you into spending all day wandering around looking at art.  The hospital museum was somewhat interesting.  Their brochure was offered in 10 languages, including Japanese and Norwegian -- I'm not sure why they were more accommodating in that way than anything I've seen in Paris, but whatever.  The museum had restored the hospital's main room, which was a room full of fancy beds, basically -- the most a doctor could do in the 16th century was watch you die, I imagine.  And they had on display all sorts of crude medical instruments from the past 5 centuries.  Syringes, proto-stethoscopes, tooth-pullers, do-it-yourself-enema-instruments (really), hatchets, toothpick-looking things, blood-letting pans, and, of course, the most important medical tool back then, coffins.  One of the rooms had mannequins of nurses caring for patients.  This is where Paris is different from America.  In America, there would have been real women dressed up as nurses from the 16th century, in period costume, churning butter and playing with leeches.  But here all we got were big dolls.  No fair.  Onto the art museum, where I once again was reminded I don't like art museums.  The exhibit on display was all sorts of work by some guy I never heard of, mostly where he drew men and women but replaced the women's faces with funnels or cabbage or other stuff like that.  My cousins thought the paintings were depressing.  I thought he was trying to preach tolerance -- I love you even though your face is made of cabbage.  I don't know.  The third museum was the wine museum, which featured a fascinating gallery of hoes and spades used in the fields.  The hospital museum was really carrying the rest of the 3-pack.  The art and wine museums were simply dreadful.  At least the hospital museum let me use the word enema in context.  The most interesting part of the day was lunch.  I tried snails for the first time.  Honestly, I was disappointed.  They're not strange enough.  They taste like mussels or clams or any of the other stuff you might think they'd taste like.  Same texture and everything.  They sound like they ought to be weird and unusual and scary.  But they're not.  At least oysters are slimy and taste like ocean.  They're interesting.  But snails weren't really.  I didn't mind them... but they're nothing to get excited about.  Another cool part about lunch was that I didn't order dessert, but, for the second or third time in a restaurant here, they give you some small sweets anyway when they bring the bill.  It is impossible to undereat here.  Every meal is huge and good.  Food on the street is delicious.  Crepes mostly.  Anything in any bakery -- mini quiche, any pastry, any sandwich -- is delicious.  I can spend $5 and get a great lunch including dessert by eating things from street vendors and pastry shops.  Awesome.  On the train on the way back, there was a little kid sitting behind me, probably 2 years old or so.  Along with the wooden tray at every seat on the train, he had a glass baby food jar and a metal spoon.  And he knew how to use them.  I actually didn't mind the racket all that much -- his mother tried to quiet him down but couldn't, and chose not to take the jar and spoon away from him for whatever reason -- but the people around me got more and more annoyed.  Which was fun to watch.  I have a pretty high tolerance for children doing things that children do, actually.  I mind much more when adults do things of which they ought to know better.  But that's neither here nor there.  Another book recommendation -- Adam Gopnik's Paris to the Moon, a set of essays originally in the New Yorker about the author, an American, moving to Paris for 5 years with his wife and young son.  Great writing.  A lovely read.  You'll wish you lived in Paris, had a young son, and wrote for the New Yorker.  Really.  All three.  I promise.

      The 1L Course Primer, Part 4 of 6.  100 Words About... CRIMINAL LAW  OJ Simpson, Jeffrey Dahmer, Pee Wee Herman -- we don't know their names because of their disputes about Property Law.  Criminal Law is special because if you do bad stuff regarding contracts or property law, you just pay money.  But in criminal law, you go to jail.  And jail, from all I've heard, is not a fun place to be.  In my criminal law class, we spent gobs of time talking about murder and rape, and no time at all on arson.  Which I suppose is good, since I can't remember the last time there was an arsonist on CourtTV.

      Someone has found this site by google searching "laxative torture."  Gosh.  I don't what they were hoping to find, but I don't think this is it.  Anyway... more notes on Paris.  Bill Bryson is a wonderful travel writer.  His books are awfully funny, and awfully good.  "In A Sunburned Country," about Australia, "Neither Here Nor There," about Europe, "I'm A Stranger Here Myself," about America from the perspective of someone living in London for 20 years, and not really a travel book as much as it is an Andy Rooney-style (but better, although I do like Andy Rooney oftentimes) set of commentaries (and is truly, truly hilarious), as well as a book about England ("Notes from a Small Island"), a couple of books about the English language, a small book about Africa, "The Lost Continent," about small-town America, and a science book, his most recent, "A Short History of Nearly Everything," that's as delightful a way to learn about science as anything I've seen.  He writes really well.  He's engaging even when he's not trying to be funny, and when he is trying to be funny, he's often very successful.  I say all this for two reasons -- (1) if you're looking for someone new to read, give one of his books a chance and I think you'll like, and (2) honestly, when I'm writing this Paris stuff, he's the model I'm holding up in my mind as an example of someone who I think does this really well.  So I just figured I'd let you all in on that.  Anyway, here goes.  This is longer than it needs to be -- I apologize for that.  But hopefully it's interesting and worth the read.  1. Musee de la Musique -- After a hearty breakfast of four different varieties of cheese, I took the Metro to Parc de la Villette.  All of the tour books I've seen say it's a lovely park, under-visited by tourists because it's out of the way and barely in the city.  But it's home to the music museum, which I figured might be interesting (and the Cite des Sciences, which the guidebooks all like, and, while art museums aren't my thing, I figured anything with a giant 1000-meter squared geode IMAX screen had to be cool (I was hoping the brochure would say "12 stories tall" or something to that effect.  I have no idea what 1000 meters looks like).  But more on that later. I got to the Park -- I mean the Parc -- at 11:40 -- the museum opens at 12 so I wandered around for a little while and watched a soccer game where everyone playing looked extraordinarily skilled.  Wandered back to the museum as it was opening, picked out the American tourists (the ones standing impatiently in line) from the French people (the ones throwing trash on the ground indiscriminately).   This museum was stupendous.  I know I had unkind things to say about Picasso yesterday, but the Music museum was fantastic.  They had an headphone audio tour -- available in English, thank goodness -- that activated every time you passed a display.  And there were lots of displays.  There were 9 "suites" in the permanent exhibit -- making up a tour of musical instruments from the 1600s to the early 1900s -- from recorders and simple harpsichords and small violins to the more complicated things we have today.  Musical samples from Beethoven, Mozart, etc, with context provided on the audio tour.  Definitely worth it.  Someone could have spent probably four hours in there if they'd listened to everything start to finish.  The only downside was that the range of the headphones was small, so you only heard the music if you were standing right in front of the exhibit -- take three steps, and you lose it.  So there was a lot of standing and listening and seeing how far I could stray and then walking back.  This part of the museum was virtually empty, because no one comes to this museum anyway, and the people who do are probably there, I gathered, for the temporary exhibit...  ...which was a huge and ridiculously comprehensive journey through the career of Pink Floyd.  "Pink Floyd Interstellar," it was called, and looked like it was put together with great care.  Listening booths, psychedelic lighting, posters, TV clips, and on and on and on and on.  If I was a Pink Floyd fan, I would have been in heaven.  Taking a stairway to heaven, in fact (that's not them, is it...?).  The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame should visit this exhibit to learn what they ought to do.  I've been to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the problem was it was too broad -- too surface -- this exhibit was deep and interesting and wonderful... if I liked Pink Floyd.  A Billy Joel exhibit like this, I'd travel three hours and pay $30, no question.  They had handwritten lyric sheets, actual instruments used, behind-the-scenes clips, props used in music videos, newspaper clippings, all presented in a very attractive and elaborate set of displays.  Excellent stuff.  Although I don't know why they chose Pink Floyd and not, say, the Beatles, or Bob Dylan, or Britney Spears.  Yeah.  2. Science Center -- I wandered across the Park and found the Science Center, an enormous building.  Grabbed a brochure.  And realized I was all museumed out and didn't really need to see the exhibit on "Bamboo, an unusual Grass." That's right from the brochure.  Also the odd "Scenes of Silence -- an exhibition experience, in silence, to develop awareness of non-verbal communication."  I swear I am not making this up, but the brochure flags the "Scenes of Silence" exhibit as being "presented in English."  Figure that one out.  I appreciated the brochure, the walk through the parking lot as I looked for the cafe, and the toilet.  But I decided I would save my 6 Euros and head elsewhere.  I did pick up a card by the gift shop advertising the "Tenniseum" (great name), the museum of tennis.  Be patient.  I have more to say on that one later.  3. Next stop was the Champs-Elysees, a street filled with stores they have in America.  Haagen-Dazs, McDonalds, Gap, Benetton, and the Virgin Megastore.  I spent 27 minutes in the Virgin Megastore.  Alert readers will make the ironic observation that I spent as much time in the Virgin Megastore as in the Picasso museum.  Yes, yes, I know.  It was interesting though -- I listened to French pop at the listening stations, amused myself by reading what the translations were of movie names in the soundtracks section, and found a curious section called "West Coast" that was filled with CDs by the individual members of the Eagles (Don Henley, Glenn Frey, etc), Chicago (Bill Champlin, Peter Cetera), and a whole bunch of Japanese import CDs of American country music songwriters who never had solo careers in the states.  This was an odd discovery.  There is some country music I like, and I'm reasonably familiar with the names of a bunch of the songwriters, because I look at stuff like who writes the songs I like.  Apparently these songwriters, used in America solely for their songs and not their voices, release Japanese CDs that then get imported to France.  For $1, I would have bought some, just out of curiosity.  For an average of 33 Euros (40 bucks) each, I'll stay curious.  Weird.  Prices in general were pretty high.  I was not tempted.  4. As I wandered down the Champs-Elysees, I saw a huge line in the street.  I looked up and saw I was near a movie theater.  The first title I recognized was "In The Cut."  It baffled me for a moment why that would have a huge cult following in France, and then I realized that the poster for Le Signeur de Anneaux (forgive the spelling if it's wrong -- I scrawled notes on a receipt to remind myself of stuff throughout the day -- it's not that legible).  I assume that means Lord of the Rings.  Huge line.  5. Reached the Arc de Triomph, a huge archway covered in scaffolding.  The real triumph at the Arc is figuring out how to cross the street.  13 streets intersect at the Arc.  "And only one man survives...."  6. At this point, I began to think about buying a gift for my mom's birthday, which is just after the new year.  A gift from Paris would be cool, I think.  I'm a bad gift buyer, though, because (1) I like my gifts to be meaningful, and (2) I like my gifts to be cheap.  And (3) I have a hard time buying things for people that I wouldn't want to get, and that limits my choices to thinks with food.  :)  Not really, but sort of.  So I went into a gourmanderie, translation obvious, and looked around.  Smoked fish, mustard, and duck liver all sound like terrible gifts.  I will continue my search.  7. At this point I decided to venture off to the Tenniseum, prompted by the card I picked up at the Science Center.  The card says there's 100 of something there.  Exhibits? I don't know.  Maybe tourists.  I would try to be #101.  The Tenniseum is such a popular attraction that it is not listed in any guidebook, and in fact is off the map in the guidebook I've been relying most heavily on ("Paris for Idiots," by a five-year-old).  It took 4 trains to get there.  I think the stop was d'Estination Final.  So after I got to the stop the card insisted was closest, I looked around, and blessed with a terrible sense of direction, hoped for a street sign.  I saw a street sign.  It was ambiguously pointed (another 13-way intersection).  I went unambiguously wrong.  I found myself walking on a dirt road past apartment buildings, sure I was wrong but not knowing how to fix it.  Eventually, after a giraffe crossed my path, I asked the only man in sight to help.  I said "Pardon," and he said, in broken English, "You speak English."  Yes, my pronounciation of "Pardon" was all it took.  I showed him the map on the back of the card and he laughed.  "You are North.  This is East.  This not accessible on foot."  Thanks.  "Return to the train station and try going right.  You get closer."  So I did.  And I found myself walking through an empty park as it was getting dark.  Passed a woman, asked for help.  "Pardon."  "I am sorry, I do not speak English."  "Map?"  She looked at it.  "You can no get there on foot.  Highway.  Must cross.  No foot."  Aw, screw it.  Back to the metro, I give up, no Tenniseum for me.  Maybe the guidebook authors couldn't get there either.  And that is enough for one day.  Sorry nothing about the law.  I'm trying.

      The 1L Course Primer, Part 3 of 6.  100 Words About... PROPERTY  Are you allowed to siphon water from the ground underneath your neighbor's property?  Can you remove a stone wall on your land that just happens to be keeping the mountainside from collapsing and your neighbor's house from falling into the ocean?  Can the government take your house away just because it wants to?  Leases, covenants, and an arcane rule about not being able to leave property to people who may not come into existence until more than 21 years after you die (there's no way I'm getting that right) are just some of the fascinating things you'll cover in Property!

      I stand corrected.  Apparently entree means appetizer.  I was thinking of entrer.  Which means enter.  My notes must have gotten smudged.  :)  One of the more interesting places I visited yesterday was the Musee de Publicite, which is close enough to English that even I could have a pretty solid guess what it would be about.  They had an exhibit on the history of Air France and all of its advertising campaigns -- and, what was truly interesting, a multimedia component where you could sit down at a computer kiosk and watch a selection of French TV ads from the last 30 years or so.  I spent a solid thirty minutes watching ads for beer, soft drinks, and chocolate.  It was fascinating.  The other thing I noticed was that French keyboards are all mixed up.  The A is where the Q should be, for example.  And there are all sorts of accent marks and carets and weird characters we don't have.  But the A where the Q should be -- that really threw me off.  The Unofficial Guide to Paris tells me my planned excursion to the Music Museum and the Science Museum in a park on the edge of town is worth it, and should be less crowded on a Saturday than other things I might choose to do.  I am not a good tourist.  As you could tell from my observations on the Picasso museum, I don't love art museums.  I have a tendency to speed through museums, not really interested in taking the time to look carefully at things.  Especially paintings.  I did the Museum of the History of Paris (which was anart museum, despite a name that indicates it mightn't have been) yesterday in 22 minutes, the Picasso museum in 27, and the Publicity museum was saved mostly by that kiosk.  And at about 5 dollars a museum (this history museum was free), I'm wasting my money.  Hence, in an attempt to be the only tourist ever to do so, I intend not to visit the Louvre.  Really.  And not to make a point or anything, just because I don't think I'll get anything out of seeing the Mona Lisa in a mob of hundreds of other tourists.  And the museum of modern art, in a lovely modern building with the pipes and staircases on the outside, was lovely from the outside.  But I just didn't have a desire to go in.  The music museum today will hopefully be cool though, and the science museum. And, on a reader's tip, the Musee de somebody-from-the-19th-century on Monday.  Jacquesmart-Andre, I believe.  I don't know if that's his name or the place he shopped for groceries.  I'll let you know.  This post has been less interesting than yesterday's, I think.  Sorry about that.  I'm better when I'm working off notes scrawled in the margins of my guidebook.  "Subway handle -- detached penis" was one of my notes yesterday (see #6 on yesterday's post).  If the woman next to me on the train knew English and saw me write that...

      Notes on Paris:  1. Waiting for the bus, a woman propped her bag up on the garbage can.  Went through her bag for something, found a piece of paper, a receipt or something, threw it on the ground.  She literally had to make an effort to do that.  Had she dropped it, it would have gone in the garbage can.  My cousin said that's a good illustration of what French people are like.  2. If you pay 3.50 Euros at the Eiffel Tower, you can climb to the 2nd deck, and then take the elevator up to the top. For 6.50 Euros you can ride all the way up.  I'm cheap.  But here's what they don't tell you: 800 steps.  Eight Hundred.  Burned off a crepe or two, I hope.  3. Entree does not have anything to do with food.  4. If you want to know about Pablo Picasso, visit the Picasso Museum.  It should be called the Picasso Stalkers Museum.  Every letter he ever wrote or received, every doodle on the back of an envelope, every train ticket stub, daily calendars, shopping lists, newspaper clippings he had saved, dirty plates with half-eaten meals (kidding but only about that last one).  Every picture of him anybody ever took.  Insane!  Who could possibly want to know all this.  They have a newspaper clipping he cut into a funny shape probably out of boredom.  On displaty as a "decouppage."  They label each doodle with the type of pen he used!  "Picture of an eye, Bic medium."  I guess they had to justify the $6 admission.  5. I have a strange compulsion to try French sushi.  Looks so out of place next to the four billion patisseries, boulangeries, and charcuteries.  I have no idea what any of those words mean.  But they're all over the place.  6. The picture on the train instructing on how to move the handle and open the door looks like a picture of a man reaching for his detached penis.  7. I figured out that I can judge whether or not I'm in a tourist area by the price of street crepes.  At under $2 (I'm converting from Euros for you), I'm probably okay.  At $3 or more, I just need to look at my map and figure out whether I've wandered back toward the Louvre again.  s tehe price reached $4 in one spot, I found myself at what could best be called "The Overpriced Tourist Bazaar," a collection of wooden booths (think fleamarket stands only nicer) selling all sorts of crap no one would ever need.  Small figurines, fancy scarves, foie gras, bads and necklaces, pretty hand-carved silverware, wooden airplane toys, more foie gras, crystal dishware and vases, marzipan fruits, wooden clarinets, costume jewelry, pashmina, "I Love The Louvre" t-shirts, $4 crepes, and more foie gras.  I love to watch people spending money on useless things they don't need.  Meanwhile, I wasted $2 because I had to buy a second metro token after I screwed up the first time and got stuck in the turnstile.  8. Doors here push when they should pull.  If a crowded patisserie catches fire, no one's getting out alive.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

      The 1L Course Primer, Part 2 of 6.  100 Words About... TORTS  Whoops, I ran you over with my rickshaw.  A tort is a wrong, an accident, an "oops."  Like your toaster exploding, your hot McDonalds coffee burning you, or your doctor cutting off the wrong leg.  Tort law deals with how we figure out whether someone is to blame for the lung cancer you got from smoking, and how much money you deserve because eating Burger King made you fat.  Words like "negligence" become important.  Words like "ambulance chaser" become important.  Words like "asbestos" become important.  The key here is civil liability -- money -- not criminal (jail).  That's another course.

      Live from a foreign country, where I have no new insights about law school or the practice of law.  The crosswalks here are weird.  And the Haagen-Dazs flavors are really different.  These are my only observations today.  Sorry.  I'll get inspired later perhaps.

      The 1L Course Primer, Part 1 of 6.  100 Words About... CONTRACTS  In Contracts, you learn about deals between parties to buy something, sell something, or do something.  Basically it's about private law -- people making their own agreements, what it takes to make one of these agreements have legal force, and what happens when the agreements get broken.  Contracts is cool because intuitively we all know what a contract is, and make contracts all the time.  Effectively, it's a course about deals gone bad.  You read cases, and you also wade through the Uniform Commercial Code, a collection of the "best practices" of contract law.  This was my favorite 1L class.

      A quick note -- I'm heading to the airport to visit a cousin in Paris for a week (...I feel kind of weird saying I'm going to Paris... makes me sound much more, uh, cultured than I actually am... I haven't been to all that many foreign places... but he invited me to visit, and it seems cool, and I found a $300 flight, so why not...).  He's got Internet access, so I expect I should be able to post as usual, but just in case you wonder why I'm posting at 4 AM, or if I miss a day because I'm waiting in line to see the Eiffel Tower, you'll know why.  Actually, if I have any readers in Paris (sure...), I'd love to know what the cool stuff to see and do (and eat) is that isn't the obvious stuff in the guidebooks (the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre... although I don't have the patience for art museums..., the Leaning Tower of-- oops, wrong country).  PS -- Just in case I can't get to a computer to post, I've pre-loaded the system and set up Blogger to post something fresh each day at noon for the week I'll be gone.  A 6-part series on traditional 1L classes.  Nothing hilarious, but maybe useful for any 1Ls-to-be that are reading.  Part 6 is funnier than part 1, just because I got sort of bored while writing them and had to amuse myself.

      The rare post that isn't trying to be funny.  A reflection on being a 2L.  Sort of.    Last year, when friends would ask me about law school -- would ask if they should apply, even if they're not sure they want to be lawyers -- I would pretty much give them an unqualified yes.  "Have a reason for going, know why you're there, understand what you're getting yourself into--- but I think there are lots of reasons to go to law school beyond being absolutely sure you want to practice law."  After all, classes are interesting, the people are interesting, being a student is a lot more enjoyable than working at a miserable job, a law degree is a respected and nice thing to have, being a lawyer is an awful nice backup plan for anyone even if it's not their passion, people in all sorts of fields have law degrees, it's a better feeling to wake up in the morning knowing that even if the day sucks at least at the end there's a degree, as opposed to being at a job you don't think is leading anywhere and wondering what the heck you're there for and what you're really getting out of it.  And who knows, there are lots of kinds of law to practice, and how do you know you don't want to practice law, and maybe you do and if you don't go to law school because you're not totally sure yet then you're missing out on the chance to discover your real calling.    All still good reasons, no doubt.  But this year, I've found myself colored by the recruiting process a bit.  Colored by life as a 2L not being as new, as fresh -- as all-encompassing -- as the 1L experience.  It's easy to ignore the post-law school future as a 1L because there's so much other stuff to focus on.  There's some degree of intensity and pressure, everything's brand new, everyone's brand new, the focus is on the present and whether you're learning civil procedure or not, more than it is on what you're going to do with the degree.  But lately, when friends of mine ask if they should go to law school, my gut answer isn't the same pretty much unqualified yes.  It's more nuanced -- "Do you think you want to practice law?  Do you want to work at a law firm?  Can you not think of anything else you'd rather do, be more excited about doing, feel is really your passion?"  Not that I've discouraged anyone from going to law school.  But 2L year has surprised me because it's been so much more -- I don't know -- vocational than 1L year.    We returned to campus in the fall and were immediately ushered into this on-campus recruiting process where, basically, you're deciding what you're going to do after law school, but in a world where the only choices are the 500 big law firms that come to campus.  The handful of people who don't go through the process are the ones who are sure they want to do something else law -- public interest, the government, etc -- but most people do it, most people interview, most people (at least here, and I recognize that's not the case everywhere) get jobs somewhere.  And so for about six weeks now everyone's had job offers, and there's this feeling that law school's done.  That the next year and half is just playing out the string, none of it really matters, we're on our way out, we're finished here.    Which is a substantial flip from a year ago, when everyone was if not at least concerned about their grades and their reading and their law school experience, at least they were ready to acknowledge that it made some sense to be concerned and to care and to not be completely checked out emotionally from the whole experience.    As I write this, I'm realizing I started this post off with the wrong hypothesis.  I don't know that my answer is different now when my friends ask about law school because of the "do I want to be a lawyer?" question.  I think more than that, my answer is different because law school is less fun -- fun's the wrong word -- less stimulating, less engaging, less fulfilling when people are checked out.  When people don't care.  I'm as guilty as anyone else, I suppose.  But it's just a different feeling.  It's the bad job feeling -- the "why am I here, what is this accomplishing" feeling.  Once you have that job offer -- and I think maybe even whether you want it or not -- the stakes are gone, the fear of falling off the cliff is gone, the edge is gone -- and that makes it a less rewarding place to be.  And I don't know if there's any way around it.    Last year, I remember 3Ls saying they really did feel like the whole year was unnecessary and why were they there.  And I dismissed it as people who just hadn't gotten enough out of the experience -- who didn't make enough friends, who didn't understand that being a student is not a bad gig, who were just too eager to graduate and start their firm jobs.  But maybe it's more institutional than that.  I don't know.    And I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, because I'm not -- by and large, I've enjoyed law school, and I'm glad I'm here.  I just don't like the days when I wake up and wonder what the heck I'm doing and why this felt sort of important last year, and now it feels sort of like a charade.  Not always, just a little bit, but enough to make me want to write about it.    So I just thought I'd share.

      E-mails I Didn't Receive From 1Ls About Exams  Jeremy, I was hoping you might be able to give me some advice.  I just took my Contracts exam yesterday, and this morning I woke up in a cold sweat because I think I cited Frigaliment when I meant to cite Raffles.  It was a really important part of the exam, part (g) of question 17, and even though I wrote in parentheses (the ships case) and not (the chicken case) I'm concerned my professor won't have any idea what I'm talking about and I'll get an A instead of an A+.  So I was thinking that I would sneak into her office and replace my exam with a corrected version.  I know exactly what hours she keeps, since I've been trying to visit her as often as possible and get in her good graces so she writes me a good recommendation for the 1L pre-clerkship honors program I'm applying for over at the local courthouse, and I've also befriended the security guard by baking him cookies so he lets me in to see her after hours -- so I'm sure I could get in.  I could even use the key I mhad made when I took a plaster image of the lock on her door one day when I was bored.  This way she'll know I knew the case.  Do you think that's a good idea?  Jeremy, I need your help!!  I just discovered that the version of Glannon's I've been using for Civ Pro is 6 months outdated!!  I think the evil demons who attend law school with me must have gotten all of the current editions from the bookstore first, leaving people like me with these almost-useless old and expired versions!!  Some people!!  So I was hoping you might know offhand which of the rules of civil procedure have changed in the past six months, and whether I'm going to need to drop out of law school because I've been studying from the wrong book or if you think I can still squeak out a C and stcik around for one more semester of watching my classmates backstab me my doing their homework AT MY SEAT in the library, or raising their hands in class JUST WHEN I'M ABOUT TO, or stealing my boyfriend BEFORE I EVEN ASK HIM OUT!!  It's horrible, these law students, they're all just awful.  Luckily I am level-headed and normal.  Just a typical reader of your weblog I'm sure.  Jeremy, I didn't know where else to turn so I thought I'd write to you.  I was taking my law school exam, and I think I might be pregnant.  You see, I was reading Glannon's for Civ Pro last night.  But I was reading it naked.  And all of a sudden I got so excited about Civ Pro, I mean really excited, I love Civ Pro, I really do.  So I got really really excited.  And now I think I'm pregnant with Glannon's baby.  Really.  Because I'm feeling these feelings right now while I'm taking the exam.  These strange feelings.  For example, I just threw up.  And I'm eating my pen.  Please help.  Jeremy, I don't know you, and frankly I never even read your weblog because it's really just not that funny.  But I was wondering if you could send me your Criminal Law outline, your Torts outline, your Civ Pro outline, and your future first-born child.  Thanks.  Jeremy, I am the grandson of a wealthy Nigerian businessman hoping for your help in converting my Nigerian bank account to an American...

      Someone got here by searching for "jurisprudentially octopus" on Yahoo.  I'm as clueless as you are.  Is there a class on the Law of the Sea?  I watched the Survivor Finale tonight.  Hard to care when you've only seen two or three episodes.  Hard to care anyway.  But the life of a 2L done with exams is not a life with many obstacles standing in the way of watching the Survivor Finale, so I figured why not.

      Upcoming law-related movies and TV:  MOVIES  Julia Roberts stars in a brand-new film, "Mona Lisa Copyright Infringement."  In this thriller, Roberts paints a beautiful picture of the Mona Lisa, and then is shocked to discover someone already painted it, hundreds of years ago.  Oops!  A worldwide manhunt ends with Roberts discovered in a six-to-eight foot spider hole with ventilation deep in the farmlands of Iraq, with a shaggy beard.  DNA evidence proves it is her, and she is tried in an international criminal tribunal for her copyright violations.  Co-starring Judge Judy, who hopefully will also be starring in the Saddam Hussein trial, if the U.S. government has any idea what makes good international war crime tribunal television.  Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear star in the brand new comedy, "Stuck On Rule 501," a rip-roaringly hilarious story about the Federal Rules of Evidence.  As Siamese twins, the court is forced to ask whether it's really hearsay if there's no doubt the witness was right there at the scene!  Hijinks ensue.  TELEVISION  "Will a beautiful supermodel find love in a Sears Prize winner, or will she settle for an average-grades Joe?"  That's the question that NBC asks in season two of "Average Joe: Joe goes to law school."  Sixteen B-students compete for the heart of a beautiful woman who scored a 120 on the LSAT.  But when three former Sears Prize winners are added to the mix, who will she choose?  Watch as the contestants compete for her love in moot court!  And then there's the new "Tracy Morgan Show," which is just criminally bad.

      Wow, looks like they've got Saddam Hussein.  His DNA tests, besides proving that he's actually Saddam, also proved that he is indeed the father of the baby.  Yes, Saddam's a dad.  No, I don't exactly know what the joke is I'm trying to make, and how to make it a little bit funny.  Sorry.

      A friend of mine has already suggested forming a study group for some classes we've got spring semester.  Apparently just a panic reaction after an exam she had yesterday that didn't seem to go as well as hoped.  Although you never know given the curve.  In any event, forming a study group before you've bought the books, before the start of the class is even in sight, before you have any clue... would seem to be planning a bit too far in advance.  I actually didn't have any sort of study group at all for any of my classes this semester (and hardly did last year except to go over some practice exams).  I didn't make any outlines, I didn't re-read the entire semester's assignments... I mean, I studied -- I did some practice exams, read a 1000-page Con Law treatise (seriously -- and I think it's the best thing you can do for a class where you think you understand a lot of the pieces, but don't see how it all fits together, and want to really get the subject in your head and figure out what all the parts are -- I read Singer's Property treatise last year and found it super-helpful [also helped that Singer was my professor] and for Con Law this year I read Chemerinsky's book... obviously I won't know if it did good until I get my grade, but it felt helpful... much more helpful than making an outline, or reading someone else's outline, or reading a Gilbert's or any of that stuff...), made a short "checklist" of issues for each class, made a list of everything we read and one sentence about them (cases, theory, etc) -- but beyond that I didn't really feel like a whole big outline or a study group would have been all that useful.  So that's exam advice from a 2L's perspective.  Probably different from what I said last year, a little bit, but not that much I don't think.  I took the bus home to NY today.  The "Chinatown bus" -- $10 Boston to New York (cheap!), took about 5 hours, pretty uneventful, and not a Chinese person on it, I don't think.  It was pretty much all student-looking people, young working not-wealthy people, and a few middle-aged people who probably just liked the fact it was $10.  Two people sitting in front me were talking, apparently they both went to Tufts.  One of them looked around -- I guess didn't see anyone performing brain surgery or anything like that -- and says to his friend, "I bet we're the only two educated people on this bus."  Thrilling people, I'm sure.  I guess no one else dressed up enough for them.  The guy across the aisle from me, I could tell from his loud cell phone conversation, is at Harvard Medical School, and hopes he didn't catch the flu from the sick patients he's been around all week.  And as he said that, everyone within earshot got a panicked look in their eyes.  Although better than if he'd said "Ebola" or something like that.    One more random story -- I passed a sign for a church selling gifts, they'd put up signs all around the building.  One of the signs said, "Get your family the gifts they've been dying for."  The sign was on the fence next door to the church.  On the fence of the cemetery.  :)

      You may have heard about the Paris Hilton video, but I bet you haven't heard about this one...  Harvard Law Review Sex Video Making Rounds On Internet Associated Press  The prestigious Harvard Law Review reportedly has a sex video making rounds on the Internet.   In a statement issued to The Associated Press, the Vice President of the century-old legal publication based at Harvard Law School said he was embarrassed and humiliated, for himself and for the entire organization, and never expected the video that was made for private use at the Review's 23rd annual Winter Sex Party would ever become public.  "I feel ashamed, especially because my parents, my professors, and my friends have now all seen me naked," he said in a statement.  The Law Review made the video last week at the annual Sex Party, a celebration traditionally held after the December issue finishes production, the culmination of weeks of long hours, grueling work, and compulsive footnote-checking.  The Social Chair is typically in charge of purchasing supplies for the party: drinks, snacks, and, in this case, a camcorder, tripod, and a blank Sony VHS cassette.  It is unclear how the tape found itself in the hands of major media outlets, but since rumors of the tape began last week, the video has made its way onto the Internet and is now the fourth most popular Blockbuster rental.  Lawsuits from fourteen different parties have resulted since word of the sex tape surfaced, including from the Law Review's faculty advisor, who claims emotional distress from coming home one day to find his wife watching him and the eighty-six members of the Law Review engaged in a wild sex romp on the third floor of the Law School library.  One thing that has surprised watchers of the video is how the Law Review was able to hold such a wildly successful sex party when the Review is made up of 65 men and just 18 women.  Reportedly, the third-year males had first pick, and the second-year students just had to "make do with whoever was left -- girl, guy, or legal dictionary," said the Review's Recording Secretary.  On the tape, moans can be heard from all directions, as well as the names of no less than eleven Supreme Court justices, including Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, O'Connor, and Frankfurter.  Five members of the Law Review have already accepted offers to pose for PlayLaw magazine.  The school is reportedly investigating the party to ensure that all Massachusetts laws regarding Sex Parties were complied with.

      Just handed in my last exam a little while ago.  So, ignoring this odd little winter term we've got in January where we take one class for three hours a day for three weeks, I'm halfway done with law school. Weird.  Seems like I just started.  I'll come up with some sort of gimmick to note the halfway mark -- advice, or a top ten list, or something -- but nothing's come to mind yet.  Brain kind of fried from 3 eight-hour exams in the past 4 days.  In the meantime, you can check out the NY Times Magazine's  urlLink Year In Ideas , like I'm about to do.  Or wait twenty minutes and I'll tell you whether it's worth reading or not.  EDITED TO ADD: I'm about a third of the way through.  It's interesting, but I wish there was a better way to read it than to have to keep clicking.  I've lost patience.  I'll return to it later.

      Addition to yesterday's Con Law Critters -- "The Lochnerss Monster" -- makes sense if you've taken Con Law.  He mostly leaves people alone and lets them do whatever they want.  Then his girlfriend Carolene chews him up, spits him out, and leaves him on the side of the road for spectators to look at and then turn away.

      Studying for Con Law has inspired me to create a cast of characters fit for a new show on the Cartoon Network, perhaps called "Constitutional Critters" -- or perhaps not.  "Commerce Claws" -- as his name implies, he has giant claws.  He can use these claws to snatch back people moving across state lines, or pluck them out of the pipes and sewer systems I think of whenever I think about "channels of commerce."  Unfortunately for Commerce Claws, his wife had a terrible accident a few years ago and is in a coma.  So you could say she's Dormant.  "Wanda Mentalright" -- obviously she's from whatever foreign country allows her to pronounce her W's like F's, that goes without saying.  But beyond that, she is quite a woman.  She has two boyfriends.  And, let's just say, her personality when she's "under" Doop Rawcess is just a little different from when she's "under" E. Qualp-Rotection.  They're very different men from each other.  In ways I can't even begin to describe without opening my casebook first.  "Ray Shnelbasis" -- is very easy to step all over.  He's the pushover of the group, the guy who'll always defer to whatever everyone else decides.  He'll eat wherever, he'll do whatever, as long as it's not too radical or strange.  "S. Rick Tscrunity" -- is Ray Schnelbasis's evil twin.  He works as a bodyguard, and nearly nothing gets by him.  He blocks stuff from getting by.  "The Alien" -- comic relief.  An actual alien!  Who is entitled to public school!  Imagine the hijinks an alien can cause IN PUBLIC SCHOOL!!  Especially when paired with his teacher, Mr. Brown, who spends all day trying to make The Alien play with all of the other children -- you know, in a nice integrated classroom.  It's HILARITY!!!  (Will Ferrell is the voice of The Alien!!!!)  "Ty Mplacemanner" -- he loves to make rules.  Oh how he loves to make rules.  I think we write him off after the second episode.  He's not so much fun.  "Rita Travel" -- she goes on trips to states, collecting welfare benefits and voting.  Very exciting, and a great device for getting us to new places quickly.

      Apologies to non-baseball fans for this one.  According to the NY Daily News, the Mets may pursue pitcher Miguel Batista:   Instead, the Mets have spoken multiple times with Miguel Batista's agent... it's likely he would fall within the Mets' price range. Batista - who writes poetry and kept a picture of Albert Einstein in his locker - is also the good-in-the-clubhouse type the Mets typically like.   I've read articles before that mentioned Batista being unusually learned for a baseball player, or something like that.  Actually, I'd like to read some of his poetry.  In the alternative, I can just make some up of my own:  Selections from "The Bad Haiku Journals of Major League Baseball Players"  (Pedro Martinez) Come closer, bald man Let me throw you to the ground And lose the Series  (Greg Maddux) Eleven long years And they've cut me loose like this Arbitration.  Sigh.  (Vladimir Guerrero) Offer me contract Someone, please, I'm really good! No, I really am!  (Jesse Orosco) I've found the secret Of playing ball forever One fastball a week  (Curt Schilling) I don't want a trade How I love my no-trade clause Oh please please trade me  (Mo Vaughn) A baseball is round I am pretty much round too I eat round baseballs

       urlLink Prof. Brian Leiter , a professor at UT with a weblog of his own, writes about the "recommendation letter code" and how they're all too inflated and over-the-top.  He links to an interesting article  urlLink here  with more on the topic.  Leiter and the article are both referring to recommendations for professor-ships, but it's all the same.  Reading this stuff inspires me to parody.  Recommendation Letter For Law Firm Job from Law Professor  Dear Hiring Partner,  I teach a hundred and fifty students a year, and am lucky to remember six or seven names outside of class.  So when Jack Simmons came to my office and asked me to write him a letter of reference, I must admit I had no idea who he was.  I did not know if he was a 1L, 2L, or 3L, whether I had taught him in Contracts, Corporations, or in my Tennis workshops on the weekends, or whether perhaps I had once seen him in the library and had accidentally acknowledged his existence.  Nevertheless, when he told me how much he had enjoyed having me as a professor, and especially how I went out of my way to be accessible to students and really get to know them as people -- and when he handed me a copy of my book and asked me to autograph it for him -- I instantly remembered the fine young man who had been one of the star pupils in my class last semester.  Some professors employ the Socratic method in class and challenge their students to think on their feet -- in those classes, professors can often get a good sense of who the brightest of the bunch are, and which students are more like dullards.  I, however, enjoy hearing myself speak more than most, and so I conduct my class exclusively as a lecture and never take questions.  This allows me to form impressions of my students based on looks alone.  And Jack is certainly a spiffy dresser, although his hair is a bit too long and he could use those toothpaste strips that make teeth just a few shades whiter.  But these flaws do not obscure the fact that he was always attentive, often on time, and sometimes awake during my class.  There was no other student in his seat besides him, and that is certainly saying something if it's saying nothing at all.  So, needless to say, I was as delighted as a professor who knows none of his students by name could possibly be when Bill came by and asked me for a letter of recommendation.  I told Bill I would love to write on his behalf, if he could be so kind as to send me a copy of his resume.  And he did -- quite promptly, I should add -- but I have unfortunately misplaced it, so I have little more to say on that subject.  But I have heard of your law firm -- I make sure to keep up on events in the legal world, although I have never practiced law a day in my life and wouldn't know a motion from a magic potion, from a genuine emotion, from moisturizing lotion, from love and devotion to my profession, and I have certainly heard your firm mentioned in long lists of other firms when students I overhear talking are talking about alphabetical lists of law firms appearing on papers they may have seen.  And based on this knowledge, I find it hard to believe anything more than I believe that John would make a wonderful addition to your firm and not disgrace you any more than he has disgraced the name of this school, which I don't believe he has, at least as far as I'm aware.  I do so appreciate your taking the time to read my award-winning prose, and hope it has proven to show that Sam is definitely a student here, at least as far as I'm aware, and I see no reason not to offer him a job, although I currently have no openings or else I would most surely consider it.  Best wishes, and a happy Arbor Day from a colleague who never even bothered to take the bar, Professor Harry Fitzwhipple

      One down and two to go.  No problems, just an exam.  My post this morning was just to write  something .  No panic.  After every exam I always feel like whatever studying I did wasn't really all that helpful -- especially for an open book exam -- pretty much everything I was able to come up with I would have been able to come up with a week ago, and really nothing I could have done all week would have changed that all that much, I don't think.  That's neither a good thing nor a bad thing, just an open-book exam thing, I think.  Because really, if I think about it, it's a lot more efficient to "study" after you see the questions than it is beforehand.  There's an argument for studying hard...  Everything seems further away when there's three feet of snow on the ground that have turned into slush.  Slush looks like it should rhyme with Bush but it doesn't.  Weird.  Makes writing song parodies harder.  I feel bad for Lieberman now that Gore endorsed Dean.  I mean, he picked him to be his running mate but now he won't support him for President?  That seems unfair.  Clearly the depth of my political thought on this matter is astounding.  After an eight hour exam, it's really hard to do anything useful.  This post is boring.  I'm sorry.  Anyone want a bankruptcy casebook?  Real cheap.  I'll throw in an outline.  P.S. You can read my thoughts on NBC's "Average Joe" finale over at  urlLink en banc .  You can also read some other interesting stuff I didn't write.  It's about the law and stuff like that I know nothing about.  :)

      I've switched over from studying Constitutional Law yesterday to studying Bankruptcy today.  Or at least to pretending to study while I stare out the window and watch the snow fall.  Snow.  Ooh.  Mesmerizing.  Bankruptcy, impossible as it may be to believe, is very hard to make fun of while still making sense to people who aren't taking bankruptcy (there's only so many times I can use the word 'discharge').  I'm trying.  I'll come up with something.  Eventually.  In the meantime, now that I've finished classes for the semester, I have a small complaint.  Professors, at least a substantial number of them, seem averse to wrapping up the course with any sort of summary, any wise words to put all the pieces together, any overarching thoughts about the 12 weeks of material we've just slogged through and what it all means.  That bothers me a little bit.  I realize it's probably largely a function of time -- that there's so much material they have to squeeze in that they can't leave any time at the end for any sort of summing up -- but surely we could have lived without that forty-minute discussion from the third week of Constitutional about why it's illegal to wrap someone in an American flag and light them on fire when it's not illegal to wrap someone in an American flag, and it's not illegal to light an American flag on fire.  Surely.  So instead of a half hour of wisdom from these professors in these subject areas they all know an awful lot about or else they wouldn't be teaching them, they all end class with some variation on:  "And that's just another case in the line of cases that brought us to that point in the doctrine that you read about last night in the casebook, and, oh, look at the time, I guess that's it for the semester.  Bye!"  It's not too much to ask, is it?  Or maybe that's what the exam is for.  To see if we can sum it up ourselves.  Hmmm.  Oh well.

I just did a yahoo search to check and find an example -- I'm right, it was called Sniglets -- for example (this isn't mine; it's from my yahoo search): Burgacide -- when a hamburger can't take any more torture and hurls itself through the grill into the coals.  Anyway, they generally weren't that funny but at least they were trying to be.  In that spirit, as I muddle my way through Con Law, I've been inspired to come up with some fake definitions for the names of parties in some cases we've seen.  My definitions have absolutely no relevance to the law, or what the case stands for.  These are not mnemonic devices and will not help you (or me) in any way.  I'm just trying to liven up the day.  Bonus points if you actually know what any of these cases are about.  'Cause I don't.  P.S. I thought this would turn out funnier before I started writing it.  My bad.  Although towards the end I get a little punchy, so don't give up if the first few have you rolling your eyes.  Dagenhart = German for "Valentine's Day."  Also a popular German frozen yogurt manufacturer.  The raspberry flavor is especially tasty.  Hodel = The sound that people who can't yodel make when they try to yodel and fail miserably.  Also the place where Scandanavian homeless people live.  Yakus = An eskimo festival, usually involving seals and ice skating.  Or ice skating seals.  Bendix = What's left of the pencil eraser after you've fallen prey to the compulsion to rip most of it off the end of the pencil.  Schenck = To throw dirty dinner plates across the room hoping they'll land in the sink without shattering into a million pieces.  Seems like it would usually be pretty unsuccessful.  Beauharnais = The ritual I assume is practiced by upper-class families of taking one's spouse-to-be on a horse ride with the rest of the family, on some large estate in the country.  Like that scene in the movie "Stepmom" involving horse riding.  Yes, I've seen the movie "Stepmom."  Gertz = To trip over the sidewalk for no apparent reason (as in, "I'm glad no one saw me when I Gertzed, because I looked pretty stupid.")  Hudnut = [definition has been deemed too offensive to appear here -- use your imagination]  Chaplinsky = The guy who presides over a Russian funeral.  Posadas = Taco Bell's new healthy offering, involving no cheese, no sour cream, no meat, and no shell.  Tomatoes and lettuce, wrapped in a piece of newspaper.  Tornillo = Taco Bell's new unhealthy offering, involving extra cheese, extra sour cream, a dollop of lard, three pounds of beef in every bite, and a deep-fried chocolate-covered candy shell.  Very popular, actually.  Red Lion = Taco Bell's new beverage offering, basically iced coffee with guacamole.  Lyng = The piece of vomit that hangs from your mouth after you throw up upon eating any of the new Taco Bell offerings described above.  Yick Wo = My reaction when I see my Con Law grade, as in "Yick!  Wo...."  Wing Wong = The sound of me hurling off the roof after I see my Con Law grade.  Zablocki = The sound of me hitting the pavement after the Yick Wo and the Wing Wong.

      OK.  A day spent with my Constitutional Law casebook, the 2003 supplement, the syllabus, and a big giant spreadsheet has yielded the following discovery: I'm probably responsible for understanding the consequences of no less than 394 Supreme Court cases on the final exam.  It's an open book exam, so this is less onerous a task than it could be.  But still somewhat un-fun.  And, just to run a gimmick further into the ground... how about a finals-themed Christmas parody song MEDLEY?!?!  Frosty the classmate, didn't work as hard as you With a brand new casebook he never read, and no doctrine that he knew But Frosty the classmate, was as lucky as can be Wishing for the best, went to take the test, and it all was pol-i-cy.  And somewhere in old Frosty's head, an article he'd seen, Was right on point and Frosty made an A-plus look routine.  Oh, Frosty the classmate, learned a lesson on that day When the friends who knew, all the work he didn't do Beat him up and ran away.  Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump, look at Frosty bleed. Thumpety thump, thump, thumpety thump, thump, next year he might read.  ...  Rudolph, the Red-Penned Teacher Had a stack of tests to grade Last day before the grades due Instead of working hard he'd played  All of the other teachers Spent their winter breaks at school Reading a hundred papers Curving to the 1L rule  But Rudolph had not read a word And the break was done "I'd sure like the students' praise.  Maybe I'll give them all A's!"  Then how the students loved him One girl even baked a cake "Who cares that you didn't read them? Every class you teach, we'll take..."  ...  You better watch out, you better not cry You better not pout, I'm telling you why Law school grades are coming to town  They're making a curve, checking it twice One or two A's will have to suffice Law school grades are coming to town  They see you when you're sleeping, recall what class you missed And that's what the exam's about, 'cause the teacher can't resist  Oh, you better not brag, you better not guess Be sure they're not being mailed to your parents' address Law school grades are coming to town

      If you liked the 2300-word version of my  urlLink Fake Law School Events Newsletter  two weeks ago, you'll love the 700-word best-of version  urlLink here  in today's law school newspaper.  Actually, you probably won't, since you've already read it all.  But in case you didn't, because it was too long, now there's a version perfect for you and your short attention span.  Good luck with your 1000-page casebooks if you couldn't even wade through 5 pages of phony newsletter.  :)

      Grandma got run over by a reindeer, Walking home from our house Christmas Day, And because her grandson is in law school, Santa and the elves are gonna pay.  She'd been drinkin' too much egg-nog, That's a fact we're gonna hide. Though she forgot her medication, It's Santa's fault that Grandma almost died.  When we found her Christmas morning, At the scene of the attack,  I said we'll get her Santa's workshop, By next year he'll be living in a shack.  (chorus)  Now we're all so proud of Grampa,  He's the witness that we need, Although he did not see what happened, "Why, Santa's sleigh was off at quite a speed!"  It's not Christmas without Grandma, We're all emotion'lly distressed, On CNN, we're gathered watching, As they all search for Santa to arrest.  (chorus)  I hear he's hired Johnnie Cochrane He's gonna say the sleigh don't fit But Santa left behind a reindeer With Comet here, it's harder to acquit  Next year we'll be sitting pretty, With a lien on Santa's sleigh We're gonna let him stay in business But we'll get our toys FIRST on Christmas Day.

      Dr. Seuss Goes To Law School  I do not like it, Sam-I-am. I do not like my law exam.  I would not like them in a class. I would not like them on the grass. I do not like my law exam. I do not like it, Sam-I-am.  I do not like them eight hours long. I do not like them when my answers are wrong. I do not like them open book. I have not liked the ones I took. I do not like my law exam. I do not like it, Sam-I-am.  Not essay form. Not in my dorm. Not fill in the blank. Not when they count toward my class rank. If I could take them weeks from now. I would not like them anyhow. I do not like my law exam. I do not like it, Sam-I-am.  I would not, could not, make them fun.  I will not like them till I'm done.  I'd like it more if I had none!  I do not like to issue spot. I do not like to think a lot. I do not like to cite a case. I do not like the hurried pace. Though sometimes it can bring me glee. That this one asks for policy. I do not like to learn the law. Although that is what school is for.  No rules to learn! No code to cite! I hate the code book, day and night  I would not, could not, in a chair. I could not, would not, it's not fair. To have to take them though we pay. A billion dollars every day. To have the privilege to be here. I want to make this very clear. I do not like my law exam. I do not like it, Sam-I-am.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  describes what happened when one of his professors tried to change the exam from December 9th to a "floater" that students could take any day between the 8th and the 16th.  To make his long story short, students complained, so the plan was scrapped.  Coincidentally, one of my classes had a similar thing happen.  The same thing, in fact.  Professor wanted to make things easier for people by letting us take the exam whichever day we wanted -- and students were upset that they'd already made flight plans and couldn't take it the following week -- and that wasn't fair because other students would have more time to study.  This doesn't really bother me as much as it bothers WT.  I mean, he's right that at this point grades don't really count for all that much, and it's not like anything about the change would really mean anyone's grade is necessarily going to change anyway.  But we're all smart people here, and given an extra week to study something, probably all of us could make productive use of the time and do a little better on the exam, and perhaps that would change the curve... and why change the rules midstream to make people worry that because they already made plans to leave on a certain day, that they might get slightly hurt on the curve.  It's not really the way I feel -- I think giving us an extra week is more like torture than a gift; studying doesn't accomplish all that much and it's just not all that much fun to have an exam hanging over your head for an extra 7 days, so I'd rather get it out of the way at the beginning of exam period anyway, even if I know 5% less than I would if I had the extra time -- but I can reasonably see why other people would feel like that.  I don't think it speaks badly to the ethos of this place or to the people, I really don't.  It's just human nature.  P.S. Waddling Thunder has some interesting anecdotes from the interview process especially if you're looking to work at a firm overseas -- so if London be your wish, you should check it out.

      UPDATE: I finished up the "Exam Survivor Challenge" post below.

      Okay, I started this yesterday and didn't get very far.  Sorry 'bout that.  Day 1 pasted from yesterday; everything else is brand spankin' new.    The 13-day Exam Survivor Challenge, as truncated from the 39-Day challenge I promised but quickly realized I can't actually deliver without this turning painful to read  DAY 1: They blindfold the class and take us on a boat, with just the clothes on our back (and our laptops with wireless Internet). We sail to a remote outpost of Madagascar and disembark, where we are faced with an instant elimination challenge. 10 multiple choice questions about the federal rules of evidence. The bottom 10% get C's and are fed to the piranhas. The rest of us are given some tools and told to build a big teepee. This will be our home for the next 38 days, or until we are eliminated.   DAY 2: Everyone's a little on edge; no one knows what's coming next. Three students are off in the corner, huddled around a Constitutional Law outline.  Four others are in the water fishing for dinner.  One student paces around camp muttering to himself about the rules of jurisdiction.  As the sun begins to set, we're told to put our books down and get ready for a reward challenge.  First person to list one hundred Supreme Court justices wins a copy of Gilbert's Administrative Law outline.  I lose.  DAY 3: We're told that there's an elimination exam this evening, but before we get there, we'll have to survive the dreaded "day of distractions."  First, we're tempted with delicious food that has only one catch: it's spiked with a laxative.  The more you eat, the more "distracted" you'll be for the rest of the day studying and on into the exam.  For those not tempted by the food, our wireless Internet ports are activated, and scantily-clad law-school-dropouts-turned-models are brought onto the island to woo us away for a day on the beach.  The exam is all about the German constitution.  Everyone fails anyway.  The lowest 5 scores are fed to a wolf.  DAY 4: Vacation.  We get to watch the natives conduct their Supreme Court session.  Some find this interesting.  The rest of us sleep.  DAY 5: Punishment.  Forced to watch the new Tracy Morgan sitcom.  Over and over again.  Three students drown themselves.  Three others poke out their eyes with shells.  Disqualified.  DAY 6: Another exam, which is welcomed after 24 hours of unnecessary laugh track.  It's sad that sitcoms need laugh tracks.  If it was really funny, we'd know when to laugh.  Bottom 15% get a B- and are dropped from an airplane without a parachute.  Some of the less morally upright among us eat our fallen comrades.  The rest of us eat fish.  Again.  DAY 7: Reward challenge.  Anyone who can prove that he or she actually did all of the reading for the semester, carefully and without skipping any cases, gets an automatic A and gets to go home.  No one leaves.  DAY 8: An obstacle course.  Leap over stacks of casebooks.  Casebooks are too thick.  Most people lose.  DAY 9: Long and complicated issue spotter, acted out for us by local animals.  The monkey gets into an accident with the bird.  The bird suffers beak damage.  The monkey's attorney (a giraffe) attempts to link the bird's injury not to the accident with the monkey but to the inordinate amount of fast food crumbs the bird has been eating lately, trash from the local McDonalds.  4000-word essay on why birds shouldn't really eat Chicken McNuggets, from an ethical standpoint.  Bottom third get B's and are forced to be the new white meat inside the McNuggets.  DAY 10: They fly a member of each remaining student's family to the island to see how Grandma Ethel would do on the ELSAT (ELderly Scholastic Aptitude Test).  Through a complex set of rules, a third of the remaining contestants (and their grandmothers) are eliminated and get a B+ in the class.  They are forced to walk the plank into a tub of egg nog.  I don't know why egg nog.  It just seems like a relatively unpleasant liquid to have to swim in.  DAY 11: Only a few students are left.  They spend the day navigating a complex issue spotter.  At the end of the day, exhausted, they are told that their answers were lost and they have to start over.  It takes them each until the wee hours of the morning to finish.  The bottom half receive an A- and get pecked to death by man-eating birds.  DAY 12: The remaining contestants take a walk around the campsite to remember their fallen comrades.  We see clips of the students that once were, and hear excerpts from their terrible exam answers.  They are visited by Justice Souter, who tells them to hang in there one more day.  They sleep, wondering what will become of them on their final day on the island.  DAY 13: They wake up and are led to an arena where the locals are enjoying a bullfight.  They watch contestant after contestant get mauled, sure that this is soon to be their fate as well.  Finally, one bullfighter does not die, but is merely maimed.  The students are then told their challenge: oral arguments.  The most convincing defense will win an A+ and a shot to return next month for the Supreme Court Clerkship Challenge.  The rest will get an A in the class, and receive a free set of study guides as a delightful parting gift.  There is a winner.  The Exam Survivor Challenge comes to an end.    See?  Better than traditional finals, yes?

      Exams here come in 3 varieties, or at least 3 varieties I know of: the 3-hour in-class, the 8-hour take-home (pick it up at 8:30, hand it in at 4:30), and the hybrid (an hour in class and then six hours at home).  I like the 3-hour variety best, just because it's shorter.  All 3 of my exams this semester are 8-hour varieties, next Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday (fun week).  I'd like to lobby for a new variety:  The 39-day Exam Survivor Challenge  DAY 1: They blindfold the class and take us on a boat, with just the clothes on our back (and our laptops with wireless Internet).  We sail to a remote outpost of Madagascar and disembark, where we are faced with an instant elimination challenge.  10 multiple choice questions about the federal rules of evidence.  The bottom 10% get C's and are fed to the piranhas.  The rest of us are given some tools and told to build a big teepee.  This will be our home for the next 38 days, or until we are eliminated.   --more tomorrow--

      I saw "The Perfect Score" today, the movie about high school kids who try and steal the answers to the SAT.  Lesson: don't go to a movie without reading a review.  The commercial looked kind of interesting.  They put the test through a shredder instead of the copy machine.  Could be funny.  Could be an interesting look at the SAT and the high stakes it has for high school students.  Or it could be a silly throwaway movie filled with underwritten characters and a poorly executed premise.  I think a documentary about kids preparing for the SAT, in the tradition of the wonderful "Spellbound," could be really interesting.  A movie about the importance colleges put on this test, and who really writes these questions.  I don't know.  But this was fluff.  This was a mediocre teen heist movie.  I was concerned right away, when the previews were for (1) what looked like a new version of "Big" starring Jennifer Garner in the Tom Hanks role, called "13 Going On 30," (2) a movie about a 15-year-old girl who wants to be a star, starring the girl who was in the Parent Trap remake from a few years ago, and (3) Scooby Doo 2.  So it was being pitched to someone half my age.  Oops.  My bad.  Should've read the reviews first.   urlLink This review , for example, should pretty much kill it for you.

      I've been getting an awful lot of visitors over the last couple of days who are seeking pictures or video of Kazuhito Tadano, the Cleveland Indians minor leaguer who appeared in a gay porn video, that I linked to an article about the other day.  I imagine to their disappointment, they're not finding any pictures, nor any video.  But, I figure to make up for that I could at least mention it again.  Ideally, I'd think of something funny to say about it, but I can't.  BUT DON'T LEAVE, people searching for Japanese gay porn -- you'll find a whole bunch of stuff here about Law School!  Which is not the same (although after reading "Brush With The Law," who knows what some people here are doing), but perhaps at least a little bit safer to be looking for on the Internet while you're at work.  I mean, if your boss sees you reading about the Law Review competition, that's a lot less likely to get you in trouble than if he sees you watching Japanese gay porn.  Depending on where you work, I guess.  [I'm crossing the poor taste line here, but: This is the biggest scandal among international baseball players since Byung-Hyun Kim sucked.  In the playoffs.  And blew.  Saves.  Forgive me.  I couldn't resist.]

BUT HOW CAN IT BE NON-TIME CONSUMING IF YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING?????  And if it's non-time consuming, then why are you telling me WHEN IT IS????? 12-5 is a time, last time I checked.  B.

      As if I wasn't distracted enough... I ordered the "Ben Stiller Show" DVD off Amazon the other day, along with The West Wing Seasons 3 & 4 Shooting Scripts book (my mom got me an Amazon gift certificate for Hanukkah and I figured I may as well start spending it before Amazon starts selling exam answers and I feel tempted)... props to their "Super Saver Shipping" -- shipping was free since the order was more than $25, they said it would take 5-9 business days to get here... it took ONE DAY.  ONE DAY.  Props to Amazon.  Anyway, my DVD collection now numbers 2.  I have Mr. Show Seasons 1 & 2 (which I've watched about 1/10th of) and now I have Ben Stiller, as I strive to build the world's largest collection of DVDs starring Bob Odenkirk.  (Alternative sentence fragment: "...as I strive to build the world's largest collection of DVDs of cancelled sketch comedy shows")  So, I just watched the Ben Stiller pilot, and then the Ben Stiller pilot with commentary.  I think I watched it when it was on for real and I was 13 years old, but I'm not totally sure.  Anyway, it was funny, and the commentary was cool.  I like DVD commentary.  The producer of the show, Judd Apatow, was on the commentary track.  He was producing this at age 24, he said, basically because he met Ben Stiller while they were waiting on line for Elvis Costello tickets.  I get discouraged when I hear things like, "yes, I became able to do for a living what I most loved doing because I accidentally tripped and fell into Lorne Michaels' lap one day in Des Moines."  Frustrating.  Judd Apatow went on to write cool TV shows like Freaks and Geeks, if I'm not mistaken.  The other guy who did Freaks and Geeks, Paul Feig, wrote a really funny book I read about a month ago on an airplane.  What is the point of this post?  I don't know.  The West Wing is so well-written.  Best cancelled sketch comedy show I remember from my childhood (I feel so old saying that) that I would buy if it was on DVD: The Dana Carvey Show.  Maybe I just thought it was funny because I was a wee tot, but I recall being awfully upset it got cancelled.  I wish they put that on DVD.  Even with no commentary track I would buy it.  Because it wouldn't cost me any money.  Because I still have the rest of the gift certificate.  See, it all loops back into a nice neat circle.  I promise a better post soon.

      Ack, this  urlLink Blogmadness  blog contest is a pain.  I didn't realize it's like 8 rounds before there's a winner.  I won the first round pretty handily (thanks to anyone who voted); I don't feel all that compelled to win any more rounds, because I feel pretty stupid asking someone to vote in round after round after round.  So the link is there but don't worry about it; if you're going to spend 10 seconds devoting your goodwill to me, I'd rather you e-mail me to say you like what I write or you e-mail a friend and tell them to read my site than you go vote in another round of this thing.  I mean, go vote if you want, but don't feel like I will be at all bothered if you don't.   urlLink voting link .  (And if you go vote, you should probably read the other guy's post and make sure you like me more, just to be fair...)

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  has an interesting post about the drudgery of work, where he quotes someone who quoted someone who said "the test of a vocation is love of drudgery it involves."  That's a cool quote.  I'd never really thought about it that way, but it makes good sense.  I mean, I'll spend forty-five minutes plugging names into an anagram generator just to find the funniest one to use in a blog post (not that writing this thing is a vocation, but I'm trying to make a point here, so bear with me) much more eagerly than I used to have to spend forty-five minutes checking out competitor web sites when I worked in marketing for a software company before this whole law school thing.  Not that I wouldn't do it, but I would do it while rolling my eyes.  And there's not a real difference in the drudgeryness of the two tasks, I don't think.  The moral of this: if you like researching case law, come to law school.  No, that's not the moral of this.  The moral is just that it's a cool quote to think about and toss around in my head for a few minutes, before I return to whatever it is I was doing before I read Waddling Thunder's post.  I think it was laundry.

      New casebooks!  Notes on flipping through my Corporations casebook ("Business Associations" by Klein/Ramseyer/Bainbridge -- Bainbridge has a blog  urlLink here , incidentally; Ramseyer is the professor I've got for the class):  1. Great introduction ("if a case is no fun, we omit it") "Lean, we think, but not mean."  We'll see if that holds up.  2. From the Summary of Contents, there's a section on "Grabbing and Leaving."  Sounds like a unit on sexual harassment.  "Short-Swing Profits" hopefully has to do with baseball.  "Freeze-Out Mergers" take place only in the Northeast in winter.  3. Winning the "double letters" award is the case of Hoddeson v. Koos Bros.  4. Winning the "case that sounds like it took place a long time ago and will be a pain to read" award is National Biscuit Company v. Stroud.  5. Winning the "case with potential for a funny footnote" award is In re Silicone Gel Breast Implants Products Liability Litigation (which is not, unfortunately, in the "Grabbing and Leaving" section).  6. Case name that gives me the chance to riff on something else for a few sentences: Springside Nursing Home.  Why are all nursing homes given sunny names -- never Cloudy Village retirement community, Stormy Night senior center, Autumn of Your Life homes and condominiums.  "Springside."  Right.  Although I have a friend who went to a Shady Side High School.  Shady Side.  Unbelievable.  Where's the drug problem in your town?  Over in the Shady Side schoolyard.  Gotcha.  6. Funny names in cases include: Humble Oil and Refining, Paw-Saver Corporation, Gay Jenson Farms, Flying Tiger Line Inc., Elf Atochem North America, Van Gorkom, Wheelabrator Technologies, Basic Inc. (couldn't get more creative than that, Mr. CEO?), and Sharon Steel Corporation (look, honey: I named my steel corporation after you!!).  7.  This casebook's got "Analysis" and "Problems" after the cases.  Not again.  Why don't they ever have "Summary" and "Explanations" or "Wrapup" and "Simplification" or "Answers" and "More answers" or "Exam hints" and "Fun irreverent facts" or like Reader's Digest, just stick some jokes down there if you need to fill up the rest of the page!  "Humor in a Dark Conservative Suit"! :)  8. There's no appendix.  My Con Law book had this neat section in the back with the names of all of the Supreme Court Justices, perfect for a quick and easy Supreme Court "We Didn't Start the Fire" parody.  (Check the  urlLink index , you'll find it.)  Here's there's nothing.  No list of shamed Enron executives or anything.  Aw, nuts.

      Clever line on The Daily Show about Joe Lieberman's New Hampshire finish -- "Last time around, he got the most votes and lost; this time, he's hoping to try it the other way around."  (I'm paraphrasing, but that was the gist of it)

      Check out VH1's new series, "I love the 1820s," where B-list pop culture celebrities reminisce about life 150 years before they were born.  [video clip of woman churning butter]  Cameron Diaz: I'm so glad we don't have to churn butter now.  Sharon Osbourne: Churning butter!  Imagine if we had to churn butter!  Mo Rocca: I churned butter once for a segment on The Daily Show, and it was not fun.  Hal Sparks: I think that woman churning butter is more famous than I am.  I used to host a show on E! and now I'm on a show on Showtime.  At this rate in six months I'll be hosting a show on Animal Planet and giving commentary on the Oxygen network about what life would be like if I was a woman.  Sharon Osbourne: He got too much airtime!  No fair!  Watch the Osbournes!  [video clip of a man on the toilet]  David Cassidy: There was no toilet paper in the 1820s  Lionel Richie: Has my career really sunk this low?  Sharon Osbourne: No toilet paper!  Ha!  There was no toilet paper!  Watch my talk show!  Mo Rocca: Your talk show just got canceled.  Sharon Osbourne: Cancelled!  And no toilet paper?  Alec Baldwin: It would have been hard to live in a time when there was no toilet paper.  I don't know what I would have done.  Stephen Baldwin: I don't know either.  Alec Baldwin: Why are you on this show?  I'm more famous than you?  You're just famous because you're my brother.  Lisa Marie Presley: And I'm just famous because my father may or may not be dead.  Toilet paper!  Sharon Osbourne: Toilet paper!  [video of slaves doing slavery stuff]  Sharon Osbourne: Slavery!  Lionel Richie: I need a new manager.  Alec Baldwin: I do too.  [video of President Andrew Jackson kicking some Indians]  Cameron Diaz: I think President Andrew Jackson is so cute.  Sharon Osbourne: President Andrew Jackson!  Is so cute!  Bob Barker: I remember when he was just a little kid.  Lionel Richie: You need a new manager.  Bob Barker: I know.  But I've spent all my Price Is Right earnings on booze and hookers.  Danny Bonaduce: Did someone say booze and hookers?  [video of pilgrims playing tennis]  Rich Eisen, SportsCenter: Tennis was big in the 1820s.  Can I get my check now?  Sharon Osbourne: Look at those rackets they're using!  Nick Lachey: My wife is dumb.  Sharon Osbourne: Tennis!  Cameron Diaz: Tennis is so cute!  Drew Barrymore: I remember when I used to play tennis.  Bob Barker: I've been neutered.  Sharon Osbourne: Neutered!  Watch the Osbournes!  Mo Rocca: Thanks for joining us for VH1's look back at the 1820s.  Tune in next week for "I Love the 1530s," with commentary by Ben Stiller, Jack Osbourne, and, from "Dirty Dancing," Jennifer Grey!

      Oddest baseball-related story I've seen in a while:  urlLink Indians pitcher asks forgiveness for role in gay porno video , on Yahoo Sports:   Indians minor leaguer Kazuhito Tadano is asking for forgiveness for what he called a one-time mistake -- his appearance in a gay porn video... Tadano took part in the video three years ago when he was a college student... "I was young, playing baseball, and going to college and my teammates and I needed money." Funniest line ever:   Tadano knows he may face fan abuse in major league parks such as Yankee Stadium, where heckling the visitors is part of the pageantry.  He joked that he's ready for it.   "I don't understand English, so it doesn't really matter,'' he said.

       Excerpts from New Hampshire Victory Speeches   John Kerry: "I love New Hampshire -- and I love Iowa too! And hopefully I'll be making passionate whoopee to the people of South Carolina, and giving a back massage to Michigan, and french kissing Oklahoma, and feeling up Wisconsin. I have a message for the influence peddlers, and the husbands of some of these frisky states. Don't let the door hit you on the way out."  Howard Dean: "If you had told me two weeks ago I was going to finish second in New Hampshire, I would have shot you in the chest and left you for dead. But it's not over yet. I'm going to South Carolina. And North Carolina. And East Carolina. And West Carolina. And John Kerry -- do you know where you're going? I know where you're going..."   John Edwards: "There's an America for the people who can afford health care, and there's an America for the rest of us. There's an America for the people who can afford fluoride toothpaste, and there's an America for the rest of us. There's an America for the people who can afford some sort of plastic surgery that makes a 50-year-old presidential candidate look like he's about 35, without a wrinkle or a gray hair, and then there's an America for the rest of... you...."  Joe Lieberman: "The pundits got it wrong! The newspaper had pictures of four candidates on the cover this morning, but not me. But what they didn't count on was that I'd finish in this 5-way tie for first tonight. That's right. The people of New Hampshire have spoken, and it's a split decision. We're in a 5-way tie for first, and we're going on."  Wesley Clark: "I came into New Hampshire as a member of the Elite Eight, and I'm leaving as a member of the Frustrated Five, everyone except for John Kerry, who seems to be winning. But he was a lieutenant, and I was a general. And I order him to Stop Winning Primaries! Now!"  Dennis Kucinich: "The pundits got it wrong! The people of New Hampshire have spoken, and it's a split decision. We're in a 6-way tie for first, and we're going on!"   [I originally posted this last night at  urlLink En Banc ]

      THIS JUST IN: John Kerry has won the Iowa caucus.  Oh.  We're up to New Hampshire now?  Oh.  I'd better refresh the web page.  Oh.  There we go.  THIS JUST IN: John Kerry has won the New Hampshire primary.  Dean places second.  Dean's concession speech:  "If you had told me a week ago I was going to finish second in New Hampshire, I would have strangled you and then shot myself.  But it's not over yet.  We're going to South Carolina.  And Washington.  And Michigan.  And South Dakota.  And North Dakota.  And Pennsylvania.  And then I'm going to prison for killing a man.  Bleh!"  Stupidity of the moment: I'm watching John Kerry's victory speech on Fox News.  He was introduced by Jeanne Shaheen, the governor (or former governor, I have no idea) of New Hampshire, who said that her TWO YEAR OLD granddaughter calls John Kerry "The Real Deal."  Right.  And there's really a Tooth Fairy.

      No classes until Monday, giving us time to recharge after a grueling three weeks of class.  :)  They baby students.  Always all of these weeks off, and a whole summer -- and WEEKENDS!  Imagine if you told a working lawyer he didn't have to work WEEKENDS!  But law students?  Not a single class!  And no classes after dinnertime, and no classes that run all night, and no classes where the professor calls you on your cell phone right when you're leaving and asks you if you've finished up the memo....  Yeah, we law students have it pretty easy.    I thought I'd dip into the e-mail-bag and answer some questions from 1Ls I'm completely inventing, because the number of real 1Ls who've e-mailed me with real questions I can count on two or three hands, and none of them that too recently.  Anyway:  "Dear Jeremy.  I just got my grades and they're really bad.  Should I have my mom call my professors and tell them how smart I am?"  No, that's probably a bad idea.  It was probably a bad idea when she did that in college too.  Heck, it was probably a bad idea in fifth grade when she called that kid's parents after he beat you up in the schoolyard.  Because you just got picked on more, right?  Yeah, it's not a good idea.  You should just relax.  Bad grades only mean you did badly on the exam, not that you're a bad person.  I mean, you might be a bad person.  But I can't tell just based on your grades.  "Dear Jeremy.  I just got my grades and they're awesome.  Should I tell everyone I know?"  No, that's probably a bad idea.  No one wants to know you did well.  If you do badly, everyone wants to know that -- but you don't want to tell them because it's embarrassing.  No one wants to feel bad.  So don't tell them your grades, and don't ask them how they did.  And don't do something stupid like say "I don't want to tell you what I got because I'm worried you'll feel bad," or "I don't want to say but let's just say I'm REALLY happy!" or something else where you think you're being coy but everyone knows what you mean.  Just tell everyone you'd rather talk about the weather.  Because the weather is a topic of great interest.  "Dear Jeremy.  I just got my grades and failed every class.  What should I do?"  Cry.  I don't know.  Go to business school??  Get a job??  Who knows.  I don't know how you could fail every class.  You figured out how to e-mail me, so at least you're smart enough to pass legal writing.  I don't know.  Tell them you have a learning disability.   Who knows.  "Dear Jeremy.  I just lost the New Hampshire primary.  What should I do?"  Well, whatever you do, don't give a crazy speech where you name all the states and then scream like a mental patient.  Don't do that.  Again.  Howard, don't do that again.  It's not good.

      I don't use this space often enough to rant against consumer products that I don't like, but that's going to change starting today.  Because today I purchased something that you, my good and decent readers, deserve to be warned against.   I was innocently walking the supermarket aisle this afternoon in search of something unnaturally weird and bad for my internal organs, like, for instance, Gushers fruit snacks, when I was lured by the smiling Quaker on the box to look at NEW Quaker Oatmeal Breakfast Squares.  I like oatmeal as much as the next guy, maybe even more, and have often enjoyed Quaker products, like Quaker Oat Squares cereal, instant oatmeal, and wicker furniture.  Or is that the Shakers?  I get them confused sometimes.  Anyway, I'm always looking for breakfast-type things I can pretend are healthy but are really just cookies or pieces of cake disguised as morning food, that I can bring to class, or eat when I'm all out of Gushers.  And the bad thing about oatmeal is you have to cook it, and that requires cleaning a pot, and boiling water, and all sorts of other stuff that takes more effort than it's worth.  So these Quaker Oatmeal Breakfast Squares looked appealing -- "all the nutrition of a bowl of instant oatmeal, for three times the price," the box said, well, except for that last part.  But it could have.  And the picture made it look like an oatmeal brownie.  And the smiling Quaker.  And the nutritional information told me they've forced in a bunch of vitamins and minerals in whatever way they do that.  And the box said "moist and chewy," and there's nothing better than food that's moist and chewy.  So after dinner tonight, I was so excited about these new Quaker Oatmeal Breakfast Squares that I couldn't wait until breakfast tomorrow.  I had to try one now!  And so I tore open the green foil package, and pulled out the moist and chewy oatmeal square.  Only it didn't feel moist and chewy.  It felt dense and heavy.  The layer of icing that in the photo on the box looked so sweet and delicious looked like white plastic goo in real life.  I took a bite.  Twelve minutes later I was able to swallow.  It's may be all the nutrition of *one* bowl of oatmeal, but it tastes like it's all the oatmeal of *twelve* bowls of oatmeal, all packed together by machine into a square brick of oatmeal, covered in white plastic goo.  I suppose it is chewy, but the only way it would be moist is if I soaked it in water.  So I did.  I soaked it in water, and found that one oatmeal square was able to absorb seventeen gallons of water before succumbing to the pressure.  Okay, I didn't really test it.  But it seems like it would.  Dogs would not eat this food.  I assume.  If we dropped these things in Iraq, they would kill civilians when they fell on them, and then they would kill more civilians who tried to eat them.  I didn't think the smiling Quaker could make something so wretchedly awful.  In fact, I'd rather eat wicker furniture.  Save yourself.  Don't make the same mistake I did.  I passed up Pastry Swirls for these.  Stupid.

      **there's new stuff beneath this post, but I'm going to leave this one on top for now** :)  One of my posts from last year is up for a vote in  urlLink BlogMadness 2003 .  I'm in the third box in the left column of the page, ranked #4.  So if you like my weblog, go vote for me!  (and tell your friends :)  I'm currently losing 3-1, but that's a surmountable deficit, I think.  Voting goes through Tuesday night for this round, and then there's other rounds, but I'm not worried about those yet.   urlLink vote here .  (the voting, by the way, requires no personal information at all and takes no time.)  (the interface confused me a little bit -- if you click the vote! button underneath the box with my weblog in it, the voting choice will come up in the far left column... so if you look there it's easy; I just didn't know to look there until after I'd read the whole center screen)

      Got back from my exam a little while ago.  My pre-exam "horror story" (not really) -- this was an in-class exam, so we needed to bring our laptops and we'd hand in a disk (for the essay part of the exam).  My computer has a detachable floppy drive (that's a good name for a song).  So I opened my drawer to get my drive out.  It wasn't there.  Looked in some other drawers.  Not there.  Called my parents.  Oh, it's there.  I forgot to bring it back from break (why exactly I brought it home with me I'm not sure).  So I woke up my roommate and asked him if I could borrow his computer, because I couldn't take the exam without my floppy drive (wouldn't be able to save to disk and turn it in).  He let me.  Had he (a) had an exam today too, or (b) felt like being mean, I'd have been in some amount of trouble, although you are allowed to hand-write the exam, so it wouldn't have really been all that big of a deal.  Anyway, if that's the worst exam horror story I can come up with I'm pretty lucky.  :)

      If anyone's got any questions about secured credit, I'm at my peak of knowledge on the subject.  Post-16 hours from now when my exam ends, I will not be as equipped as I am now to answer all of your secured credit dilemmas, like what to do if your debtor changes his name ("the artist formerly known as Prince, I'm coming after you...") or whether your PMSI primes an inventory lender.  In other news: I went to the bookstore on Friday to look at my required books for next semester -- I would've bought them if there'd been any used copies, but I didn't see any so I figured I'd just wait until next week -- and the co-author of one of them sounded familiar, but I couldn't remember from where.  I  urlLink just  figured it out.  In other other news: it's really cold outside.

      So I've had a bunch of posts this past week about nice stuff the Dean has been doing for students here -- the ice skating rink, free doughnuts and coffee for late-night studying, more money for student organizations.  I came up with some more ideas for her, in case she's reading.  I'm waiting for e-mails that say...  * "Wireless Internet has been installed throughout the campus - nay, throughout the cities of Cambridge and Somerville - and through a technology grant from the National Institute of Science, every student will be issued a laptop that never crashes, a complimentary subscription to iTunes, and a free mouse pad."  * "Through another technology grant from the National Institute of Science, HLS has been approved as a weather control site for the pilot "let's end winter" program.  A biosphere will be installed over the campus and it will be a beautiful 74 degrees each day, with a cool breeze and a bright sun.  Except the ice skating rink, which will continue to exist in the actual atmosphere for students' enjoyment until April when it finally melts."  * "The library will now feature "book absorption portals" where you can insert any book, put on the virtual reality headset, and the entire contents of the book will be transferred into your memory banks in a matter of seconds.  Also, the library has new coffee mugs for everyone."  * "The 8-hour take home exam format has been replaced with the 8-minute take home exam format, and the curve will now be centered around "A" with a standard deviation of zero."  * "Financial aid has recently seen a windfall of cash and tuition will now be zero.  In addition, each student will be receiving $20,000 in Crimson Cash, which is now redeemable anywhere on campus, on selected Internet sites including Amazon, E-Bay, and whatever that site is that delivers groceries, for rent and utilities anywhere in the Boston Metro Area, and at the local ice skate dealerships.  Also, if you ask for a cash refund of the Crimson Cash, you will receive 200% of your outstanding balance."  * "Students: in anticipation of the upcoming Presidential election, I am proud to announce that I have secured HLS its very own electoral vote.  Because the students here really are the future of the country, I thought it was only fair that we have a full 33% as much power as everyone in Wyoming to decide who the next President will be..."

      To the person who found this site by googling "Senator Kerry's prosthesis" -- you're thinking of the wrong Senator.  That's Bob Kerrey you're looking for, not John Kerry.  You're welcome.  To the person who found this site by googling "obese husband" -- I don't what you were thinking of.  Maybe try match.com.  To the person who found this site by googling "identify pill T7" -- I'm sorry, I don't know what pill T7 is.  You probably shouldn't take it until you find out though.  Go ask your pharmacist.  To the person who reached this site from the domain "PaulBunyan.net" -- I would have had something funny to say, except when I clicked on PaulBunyan.net I realized it was just a phone company.  Oh well.  Enjoy.

      I slept 11 hours last night, perhaps after reading  urlLink this article  about how sleep is really good for problem-solving and creativity.  Nonetheless, this is the most I'm inspired to write this morning, and all my sleep really didn't make me any more eager to study for my exam tomorrow.  Ah, well, I'll just force myself and 27 hours from now when the exam's over I can do something more fun like start my reading for next semester, or do my laundry, or clean my toilet.  Actually, maybe studying doesn't sound that bad.

      An update amusing only to me: last week I posted something about an e-mail I'd gotten from an organization that had published a book, that I wasn't sure if it was spam or not, saying that I might be interested in mentioning the book on my weblog.  This morning, I got an e-mail from one of my professors, forwarding an e-mail from that same organization, seeing if any student groups might be interested in having the author speak to them.  So clearly these people are really trying to create buzz or get publicity or whatever.  I'm still not telling you the name of the book.  :)

      Apparently I'm Instapundit.  Someone, I assume a reader, just sent me a link to a story saying Bin Laden's been captured according to a German newspaper.    Here's the  urlLink link .  No idea if it's legitimate or not.  (UPDATE:  urlLink Here's a link  saying it's false -- thanks to another reader)  The e-mail I got was just the link, with the subject line "Bin Laden reported captured...."  I figured 50/50 chance it was going to lead to a porn site, but whatever, any e-mail is good e-mail when you should be studying for an exam.  I also received an e-mail the other day, again I guess from a reader, that said this:   I am freelance journalist from [foreign city], who want to write serial of magazine articles about writers of some US disaster - blockbusters. I have found some sources over Internet about some such a movies and their screenwriters.    Please if you can send to me short information, which US and International rules or Law articles regulated moving (transfer) of the law case arised and filed in Europen court, to the proper US court, under assumption that both those courts have the same jurisdiction regarding such a law case.  I need those information because of writing one magazine article about writing some blockbusters US produced movies in the last 10 years.   I hope he's not writing his magazine article in English... naw, seriously I'd be delighted to help him, but beats me if I know what he's looking for.

      Okay, now it's just getting silly.  First the ice skating rink, then the free doughnuts and coffee in the student center for studying, and now this:   Dear Student Organization Presidents and Treasurers:  Thanks to the work of [other people] and the generosity of Dean Kagan, Friday the 13th (of February) has turned into a lucky day for student organizations. Dean Kagan has increased the amount of money that the Student Funding Board can allocate to student organizations on campus. In order to assure equitable distribution of the funds, the SFB will be accepting budget requests for supplemental funds... Money won't buy student happiness.  Unless maybe it will.

      More kindness from above:   Dear Students:  We'd like to let you know that the [student center] will once again be open for late-night studying during exam time....  A security guard will be in the building each night, and fruit, doughnuts, and coffee will be available.  Good luck on your exams. The exams the e-mail is referring to are the "winter term" exams.  I' ve mentioned winter term before -- for the past 3 weeks we've all had one class, meeting every weekday for 3 hours (some classes have had slightly different schedules -- 5 hours a day for 2 weeks, 6 hours a day for 3 weeks but no exam, etc etc).  And on Monday, the classes that have exams have the exams (some of the classes have papers; some have other exam-substitution things like in-class exercises).  So my exam is on Monday.  And just to boringly follow up on some posts from the last few days, for anyone who's stalking me:  (1) I got my grades in the mail just a few minutes ago.  They seem to have upgraded to a thicker envelope.  I actually had to turn my light on before I could see right through it this time.  (2) My Outlook Express problem turned out to be that my IP address was on a blocked list, who knows how or why, so that's fixed.  (3) The guy who sent me a "personal" e-mail saying I might want to promote his book on my weblog last week never wrote back, so I'm assuming it was spam, and you don't get to find out what the book was (unless you're really curious and ask me).

      The New York Times has an article about  urlLink bacon .  It's a fine article, although I'm not sure bacon has done anything recently to deserve the news coverage.  In my continuing battle to avoid doing anything productive, I actually went to a bunch of the websites mentioned in the sidebar, curious as to how there could be 40 different kinds of bacon, what exactly the Bacon-of-the-Month club can get away with charging, and whether there's a store near me that sells the center-cut low-fat bacon the article makes sound awfully enticing.  Not that I'm going to go buy bacon in a supermarket (I think I have to turn in my Jewish Membership Card if I do that), but just because reading about bacon is more interesting than reading about the winner of a battle for priority between statutory lienors and secured lenders (but just barely).

      Here they come....  From the registrar yesterday afternoon:   Fall Grades for 2L, 3L, and LLM Students: The Registrar's Office will mail grade reports by the end of the day Wednesday, January 21. Reports will not be available at the Registrar's Office except as follows. JDs who have not received their grade reports in the mail by Friday, January 23, may come to the Registrar's Office during regular business hours of 9 to 5 to pick up a copy of your report. LLMs who have not received their reports by January 23 may stop by the Graduate Program Office starting at Noon. Don't forget to bring your HLS ID card. The Registrar's Office will notify students when reports of remaining courses are available. Why say in 4 words ("We're mailing grades tomorrow") what you can say in a whole paragraph?  Anyone who thought I was just being funny when I said that we don't get grades online and they actually physically mail us a piece of paper now has proof (of course, if you thought I was making it up then, you probably think I'm making up this e-mail too).  So probably tomorrow, but possibly today, and definitely by Friday, I'll have my Fall grades.  They won't change my life, no matter how well or badly I did, but I'm still kind of curious.  It's always nicer to do better than to do worse, even if they won't really affect anything, and even if you're not totally convinced they're even a reasonable representation of how well you learned the material.  I feel like there's two levels at which someone can be concerned about grades.  There's the "the letters on this sheet will affect my self-image and self-worth" level, and the "it's nice to do well, but not doing well just means I didn't do well, nothing more than that, and that's okay."  I think at some point in undergrad, probably after the Freshman year "Advanced Multivariable Calculus and Honors Linear Algebra" class I took for no rational reason other than I was allowed to place into it because I'd done nicely on the BC Calculus AP exam, so I figured if I was allowed to place into it, it wouldn't be so bad, but I had no clue what was going on and scored a 12 out of 150 on the final exam (it curved to something nicer than what that sounds like it should curve to, but still nothing to be that thrilled about; the joke I've made too many times about the class is that the only numbers in the class were the page numbers in the textbook -- this was Math in Long Sentences filled with Greek Letters), I think when I got my grade for that, I realized it wasn't so much a reflection on me as a person as it was a reflection just of how poorly I understood how you prove the existence of imaginary numbers (doesn't that sound like fun?).  And that was probably good, especially for my television set, because I felt (slightly) less guilty watching it after that.  So, basically, I really want to find out how I did, but I don't feel like finding out I don't know Constitutional Law very well, or at least I didn't show it on the exam, will do all that much to my self-esteem.  A reader writing in to tell me my weblog sucks, however, will kill me.

The most common real word was "America" -- 37 times.  "American" and "Americans" each 14 times as well. 3. Iraq was said 17 times. 4. Women = 8 Times.  Men = 7 Times.  A victory for feminism. 5. War = 12; Peace = 4. 6. Terrorists = 10; Friends = 5. 7. Love = 2; Hate = 0 8. Life = 4; Death = 2 9. Seniors = 8; Medicare = 8 10. God = 3; Science = 3 11. Abstinence = 2; Lonely = 2 12.

      I can't make this up.  An e-mail from the dean of the law school:   To all members of the HLS community:  In the spirit of trying to make lemonade out of lemons, I am pleased to announce the grand opening of the new HLS ice skating rink on Wednesday, January 21.  Hours on Wednesday will be from noon until 10:00 p.m., with free hot chocolate and doughnuts served (but only on this inaugural day!) until 5:00 p.m.  Usual hours will be from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m.  No, we don't rent skates.  But our facilities department will send around a notice in the next day or so telling you where you can rent or buy them.    They can't do this in Palo Alto, you know.  I hope you enjoy. I'm as much of a cynic as anybody else, but how can anyone read this e-mail and not feel like at least the administration is trying its best to make students happy.  In the past year, we've been given free coffee, tea, and cocoa every morning in the classroom buildings, new benches and chairs outside the student center, renovated classrooms, the promise of a student center renovation over the summer, and the girls bathrooms apparently got free tampons.  Say what you want about Harvard, but they're doing their best.  And, yeah, it's mostly small stuff.  But the small stuff is nice sometimes.

       urlLink Drudge Report  had an audio clip of Dean screaming like a crazy man talking to his supporters after the caucus.  It's just kind of a funny clip, regardless of who you support.  But they've taken it down.  You've probably seen it on TV by now anyway.  Hopefully.  The prospective law student's version of Dean's speech:  "If you had told me one year ago that I was going to get admitted to the nation's third-ranked law school, I would have given anything for that.  "I'm going to get admitted to Yale! And Stanford! And Columbia! And NYU! And Chicago! And Georgetown! And Duke! And Virginia! And Penn!  "And then I'm going to go to the University of Phoenix Online and get them accredited -- with my bare hands!  "YAAAARGGGH!"

      In case you miss tonight's evening news:  "Good evening, and welcome to a historic night for Iowa, and for the nation, as the 2004 Election Season truly kicks off with Iowa's First-In-The-Nation caucus.  All indications are that tonight's caucus is experience the highest turnout in years, and the race has never been closer.  We've got reporters on the ground in Great Bluffs, Giant Falls, and Super Floodville waiting to give us their eyewitness accounts of the excitement they've seen today.  But first, a video clip that shows all of the candidates smiling and waving to cheering audiences that demonstrates absolutely nothing about the race.  Our intrepid senior political analyst reports:  "Thanks. I'm here at Sue Ann's coffee shop, which for over a hundred years has been a bellwether for Iowa caucuses.  However the waitresses at Sue Ann's go, so goes the state of Iowa.  And today, the waitresses are deadlocked.  Three for Dean, three for Kerry, three for Gephardt, three for Edwards, and that crazy guy out back for Kucinich.  From my vantage point here, at the center of the storm, I've seen all of the candidates and their throngs of admirers march past, on their way to a rally.  If the excitement is any indication, this caucus may draw more than thirty-one times the number of people who attended the caucuses last time through.  Of course, we can never be sure of anything here in Iowa.  It's earned its reputation as an unpredictable state.  Especially the weather.  Why, here comes some weather right now!  Back to you in the studio!  "Be careful there!  That was our senior political analyst.  Now we turn to our senior elections correspondent, at John Kerry headquarters for more about what the Kerry camp is saying about the caucuses.  Over to you!  "Thanks.  It's mayhem here at Kerry headquarters, where of course it's too soon to tell what the results will be, but people here are certainly excited.  The candidate has been criss-crossing the state today, from Moose Jaw to Antelope Head, trying to rally supporters.  Turnout at Kerry events has been rising over the last few days, and the candidate is said to be "psyched" by all of the last-minute support.  Kerry groundworkers have been rounding up voters, and driving them to their caucus sites.  One of those voters is here with me now at Kerry headquarters, waiting for the results to come in.  How are you, ma'am?    "I'm great, thanks.  I'd never been to a caucus before, but I am so excited about helping John Kerry win the nomination that I braved the cold and headed over there.  I hope I'm celebrating with a goat and a bottle of whiskey tonight!"  "Thanks, ma'am.  If all of Kerry's supporters are as excited as this woman, he may have a lot to smile about tonight.  Live from Kerry headquarters, now back to the studio.  "Thanks for the report.  That was our senior elections correspondent.  We now turn to our senior field reporter over at one caucus site he'll never forget!  "Thanks!  I'm over here at Millie's Barn, perhaps the most rustic of the over 10,000 caucus sites throughout the state of Iowa.  Remarkably, just three hours ago, this barn was not here where it is now.  Last night, it is reported that a Dean supporter came and disassembled the barn, and threw it in the river over there (camera pans to river).  Apparently, there was concern that this would be an Edwards barn tonight in the caucuses.  But the good people of Iowa have rebuilt the barn, and it will be open for caucusing tonight!  A remarkable story, but just one of hundreds of remarkable stories I'm sure, on this night of caucusgoing.  Back to you in the studio!  "Great story there from our senior field reporter.  Now, we turn to our senior campaign correspondent standing with John Edwards in the middle of a pile of hay.  "Thanks.  I'm here with Senator John Edwards, who certainly seems upbeat tonight.  Senator?  "Yes, I've been excited to see the growing crowds over the last few days, and I think I'm going to end up with a good showing here in the great state of Iowa."  "Any predictions?  "We all ran great races, it's so close, anything would be a victory for us here.  I'm not going to start guessing numbers."  "Anything would be a victory?  3 percent?  "3 percent."  "There you have it, John Edwards guessing his turnout at 3%.  Thanks, Senator.  Back to you in the studio.  "Thanks.  Now we all know that races can be won and lost based on turnout.  With an analysis of how turnout might affect tonight's caucus, we turn to our chief election bureau head.  "Thanks for having me.  The key thing to know about turnout is that when turnout is high, more people are voting.  This is critical for all the candidates, because it means that to win, they need a greater number of raw votes than if turnout is low.  So in order to increase their percentages, it becomes more difficult for every candidate, regardless of how popular he is.  Candidates hurt by high turnout are the ones who don't have that many people supporting them.  Candidates helped by high turnout are the ones who have a lot of supporters.  It's a very complicated situation.  But it's something you really have to keep in mind when analyzing tonight's results.  "Thanks to our chief election bureau head for that.  When we come back from this commercial break, we'll take a look at the crucial undecided voters and wonder whether they will ever decide.  Also we'll talk with our senior Democratic analyst on the ground at Dean headquarters and our senior news correspondent standing with a random group of screaming girls.  Stay tuned to your news leader for comprehensive election coverage here in Caucus '04: Iowa Strikes First!"

      Boring computer-related interlude.  I just sent the following e-mail to the Harvard helpdesk.  I'm sure they'll get back to me speedily but if anyone enjoys trying to solve what's probably a basic and simple computer problem, and, in the scheme of things, not really that big a deal, but still sort of a pain, feel free to read and e-mail me back the answer.  Otherwise, feel free to skip this.  There's no funny here:   I live in Harvard affiliated housing.  Since I moved in, with no problems, I've been using Outlook Express to read and send mail from my undergraduate (Princeton) alumni account, using a POP3 and SMTP setup like their instructions say.  All of a sudden, sometime last Monday afternoon, it stopped working -- I get an error message from Outlook when it goes to check:  "The server responded with an error. Account: 'mail.alumni.princeton.edu', Protocol: POP3, Server Response: '-ERR access denied', Port: 110, Secure(SSL): No, Server Error: 0x800CCC90, Error Number: 0x800CCC90"   The web interface Princeton provides has worked, so I know it's not my username and password or my account that's messed up. And I didn't make any changes at all to my computer, or where I check e-mail from -- the problem happened all of a sudden.  And I'm able to check my law school mail (with Eudora) and surf the web no problem.    I'm not sure if it's a problem on my computer's end, or Harvard's network that's blocking Port 110 or something like that.  (I e-mailed the Princeton helpdesk and they said it wasn't a problem on their end.) But the webmail interface is terribly inconvenient and I really need to know how to get Outlook to work again, or something equivalent.  Thanks so much for your help.

      Dear Prospective Student:  It's not always this cold here.  Trust me.  Really.  Don't choose UCLA over a school in the Northeast just because of the weather.  Maybe University of Hawaii.  But give us a chance in the spring.  When it rains every day.  Also, the cold isn't that bad, at least here, because the administration provides free coffee, tea, and hot cocoa every weekday morning.  Don't worry about the rumors they lace it with anti-depressants to make the students seem happy when they're really miserable.  That's just something I'm making up now but the administration might think about trying if they really want to trick people into coming here.  Because they can't change the weather.  They can try.  They are trying to build an artificial environment that could overtake the real one in a battle of wits and power.  We could soon be attending school in a square mile of climate controlled goodness, while the surrounding communities get three degrees colder and twice as much snow to compensate.  They're working on it.  You might be a 3L by then, but still, it's in the pipeline.  There's not always slush on the ground.  Sometimes there's ice.  It's not always snowing. Sometimes it's just windy.  There aren't always 8-hour take home exams.  Sometimes there are 3-hour in-class exams.  Sometimes you write papers.  All of that goes on inside, where it's not snowing.  And where it's not 3 degrees.  Kelvin.  I'd forgotten about the Kelvin scale until recently when I realized it might make more sense to use it when temperatures are consistently in single digits or lower.  It's been negative on the Celsius scale for about two weeks now.  That means that the warmth from our bodies is actually taken away from us by the weather.  I learned that in high school science.  I think.  I don't know if we can ever get to absolute zero but I think that was my raw score on some of last semester's exams.  It's also the chance of us getting our grades before spring.  Last year I thought a month was too long to have to wait for grades.  I didn't realize the 2Ls and 3Ls had it worse.  Not that it matters since we're all going to freeze to death before we get out of here anyway.  But it's not always this cold here.  Trust me.  Best wishes, A cold student

      I've mentioned before how awesome I think Bill Bryson's writing is -- he's written some awfully funny travel books, and, most recently, a thick book about science that isn't actually boring.  Anyway, the NY Times has a  urlLink profile  of him in today's edition.  Says he's pretty much covered all of the travelogues he'd want to do, and his next book is a mini-biography of William Shakespeare:        "I don't want to go and start trying to make jokes in places like India, Tanzania or Iraq," he said. "Afghanistan is not a funny place."

      Today is share-my-email day.  From a 1L friend of mine who just finished exams (and of course I wouldn't be quoting from the e-mail if it wasn't so generic as to make identification both impossible and unnecessarily silly, since there's nothing here of any real consequence):   I've turned in my final final exam. It's almost an indescribable feeling.   As I responded to him, I must just be weird.  It seems like everyone always feels this way.  Like it's such a relief to be done, and life is wonderful again now that we're past these awful, horrible, flesh-eating-bacteria-like exams.  I don't ever get that feeling.  I get a perfectly describable feeling of mild pleasure that exams are over, and now I don't have to worry about them and I can sell my books back and go get something to eat and worry about some other stuff instead.  I just never get all that excited about it.  They're just exams, there'll be more in a few months, and once school is done, there'll be deadlines and responsibilities and stuff that's pretty similar to exams in the grand scheme of things.  I mean, sure, it's nice that they're done, and I can start thinking about other stuff, but life is still pretty much the same.  I just don't get the big deal.  But, like I said, I must just be weird.

      I just received an e-mail.  I'm honestly not sure where on the continuum from spam to real e-mail this falls.  On the one hand, if this guy actually reads my weblog and really did think that I would be interested in the book that a member of his organization has just published, then I feel bad calling it spam, and really do appreciate the tip.  On the other hand, if it was this guy's job to find as many weblogs as he could and e-mail their writers to try and get free publicity for his book, I understand what he's doing but don't really feel compelled to act.  And, what makes it somewhat fuzzy in my head is that, oddly enough, I saw the book in a Barnes and Noble over break, thought it looked interesting, and bookmarked it on Amazon so I could remember to check a few months from now when the library gets a copy and maybe read it.  So here's the test: if the guy e-mails me back to tell me it wasn't spam, I know he's a reader, and if he is, I'll tell you the name of the book.  If I hear nothing, he doesn't get his free publicity.  Does that sound fair?   Greetings from a reader,  I thought you and your blog might be interested to hear about a new book by XXXX called XXXX (Publisher 2004).  It talks about XXXX in America -- everything from XXXX, to XXXX, to XXXX trying to XXXX through the XXXX and XXXX.  XXXX contends that the economic climate of the past twenty years, with its XXXX philosophy and XXXX mentality is, in large part, to blame.  The book has only been on the shelves for a couple of weeks, but has been generating some good dialogue, especially on XXXX.com.  It has also been reviewed in XXXX and XXXX.  I encourage you to check out the website -- XXXX.com -- and XXXX's personal weblog -- XXXX.com/XXXXblog.html.  He is also making an appearance at Harvard on XXXX  All the best,

       Law School A Cappella Group Names, in US News Ranking Order   (idea shamelessly stolen from  urlLink McSweeney's  list of college a cappella groups sorted by major college football rivalries, but at least I'm being honest about it)  1. Habeas Chorus 3. Scales of Justice 5. Substantial Performance 6. Scales of Justice T7. Headnotes T7. Eminent Refrain T12. Public Hearing T12. Habeas Chorus 14. Moral Hazard 17. Headnotes   Note 1: The omitted schools in the top 20, at least according to what I could find on their web sites, don't have one (the horror!).  Note 2: Can't we get a little more creative here?  Ten groups and 3 names appear twice.  Ridiculous!

       Toys for Parents Who Want Their Children To Grow Up To Be Lawyers   1. "Tickle Me, Sex Offender," a plush and furry plaintiff in a prison jumpsuit with extra-sensitive fingers.  Whenever anything touches his hand, he says, in a raspy voice, "Now doesn't that feel good?"  2. "Easy Bake Master Exploding Oven," an accident waiting to happen, complete with injured toy victims missing limbs and/or emotionally scarred for life.  Help your child train to be a tort lawyer; the set includes toy money like the kind the victims get awarded in real life.  3. "Lite Bright Religious Symbols Edition," which the ACLU calls "a first amendment challenge in a box."  Using colored light bulbs, watch your kids re-enact the Last Supper, Jesus on the Cross, the Miracle of Hanukkah, and Joseph Smith leading the Mormons to Utah.  Full-projection capabilities enable your child to share his art with kids and adults across the neighborhood by projecting it onto the wall of the county courthouse.  4. "My Little Pony's Dream House on a Hill supported by a Retaining Wall on land filled with Underground Water and Valuable Minerals" introduces property rights to children, teaching them when it's ok to make your neighbor's house sink, and when you have a duty of support.  Fun for anyone who's ever come home to a pile of rubble.  5. "Hot Wheels Grand Theft Auto," with ten of the most common cars that get repossessed each year, along with a tow truck, a crowbar, toy intimidators (complete with miniature nightsticks), and a make-your-own-writ-of-replevin kit, popular with kids of all ages.  6. "McDonalds McLawsuit Maker," helping your kids make leaky cups of hot coffee, as well as serve high-fat meals to unsuspecting customers.  Our "magic belt" system means that each hamburger your child puts down the throat of a toy customer makes the customer grow bigger and bigger, until he explodes and inside you find a handcrafted model of a distruct courtroom, and a sympathetic jury.  The bonus pak includes an advertising module that helps your kids learn how to fool people into thinking fast food is good for them.  7. "Abortion Debate Barbie," details not available at press time.  :)

      I had a chance to meet  urlLink Howard Bashman  this evening -- he gave a delightful speech here, sponsored by the Journal of Law and Technology, all about his weblog, "How Appealing," which has grown from a simple idea that it might be nice to have one place with all of the news from appellate courts around the country to something that is certainly indispensable to anyone who does any of this law stuff for real, or just anyone interested in what's going on in the legal world.  One of his most interesting stories was about how a Supreme Court clerk who relies on the site invited him down to Washington for a "backstage tour" and the clerks treated him like royalty for what he provides via his blog.  I was fortunate to have a chance to join Mr. Bashman and a bunch of other students for dinner after the speech.  I wish all of the lawyers I met during the recruiting process were as pleasant to have a meal with.  I thought he was great.    The speech will apparently be archived  urlLink here  on the Journal's web site.  My RealPlayer is corrupted so I can't tell if it's up yet.  P.S. I know I got back to my apartment before he got back to his hotel, and he still beat me to the post by 16 minutes.  Amazing.

      An article about Curb Your Enthusiasm's  urlLink Larry David  in the New Yorker.  Interesting article, about his failed stand-up comic beginnings, and a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff about how an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm is conceived and filmed.  (Thanks to  urlLink Howard Bashman  for the link.)  In all honesty: I'm not a huge "Curb Your Enthusiasm" fan.  I can appreciate that it's funny, I can recognize that Larry David is very talented, and very gifted at what he does, and when I watch an episode, I will usually laugh.  But I find the show unsatisfying.  I don't seek it out, I don't "like" to watch it.  I think it's a idiosyncratic preference I find I have for television shows and movies where I like the characters.  I like them to be funny, I like them to be entertaining -- but I also like to like them as people, I like to be able to identify with them, to understand them, to root for them.  And the problem I have with Curb Your Enthusiasm -- and that I had with Seinfeld, and Cheers, and that I have with Frasier, for example, is that I don't like any of the characters, I don't identify with them, I don't want to know them, want to watch their lives unfold, want to see them escape from sitcom situations.  When I was a kid, I liked "Doogie Howser," I liked "The Wonder Years," I liked the dorky math show on public television, "Square One" with the "MathNet" detective bits (which might not be a good illustration of the point I'm making, but good lists always come in threes).  Characters that were, on their own, without the weekly plots and stories, enjoyable to watch, characters I could identify with, and could root for.  I feel like that happens to me when I watch movies too.  I thought "Finding Forrester" was great.  No one else did.  I liked "Bubble Boy."  Really no one else did.  At all.  But in "Bubble Boy," the title character had an innocence, a naivete, a vulnerability -- I felt for him, I wanted good things to happen.  I watch a movie like "American Beauty," which everyone besides me thought was amazing, and I don't like any of the characters, I don't like the world they live in, and I just don't enjoy the movie.  I can't sit through the Lord of the Rings movies, the Matrix movies, anything science-fiction really, because I just can't get caught up in what's going on, I don't care about the world they're in.  All this is just to say the Larry David article is interesting, even if you're not a huge fan of his show.  And also I wrote all this because I felt like sharing.  :)

       Point / Counterpoint: Winter Term   As I've mentioned: we have a "Winter Term" here where while the 1Ls take exams, the 2Ls and 3Ls take one class, 3 hours a day, for three weeks.  Here's the most humor I can wring from it this morning:  A debate between six eminent legal scholars about the merits of winter term.  Just your average 2L: I love winter term.  I'm taking a class that requires a paper instead of an exam, but without a hard deadline, which means I just have to write a paper that can be handed in anytime between now and my death, and I don't have to do any of the reading or go to class, so I sleep until two in the afternoon, eat lunch, and then go back to sleep until the next day, except for when Real World: San Diego or Fear Factor are on, and then I wake up, watch them, and go back to sleep.  The professor is eagerly awaiting my paper, I'm sure, which I'll turn in once I make partner at Skadden and can get a young associate to write it for me.  Member of the Harvard Law Review: What are you, nuts?  Winter term sucks!  My note is due is two weeks and now I have to worry about waking up for my 9:00 class having done four hundred pages of reading a day, only to get so drained that I fall asleep back at my desk after lunch and don't wake up until Fear Factor's on, and then I watch that and then finally I can trudge to the library and search through the rare books room for the handwritten treatise on the childhood of Justice Warren Burger for my note to appear in the next issue.  It's awful.  At least when we take three classes at a time, I can justify the effort, but for three measly credits I'm throwing off my whole schedule here.  I hate winter term.  Professor: I know what you mean, Law Review member.  Usually, if I'm teaching two hours a week, I can wake up early the morning of my class, flip through the casebook, and come up with something reasonably sensible to talk about, like my time as a clerk for Justice John Jay, or my brother the fugitive.  But when it's three hours a day, I have to actually do work - make an outline, read a study guide, steal ideas from the Internet.  And all this on top of grading the exams from last spring I still haven't finished.  Twenty-five multiple choice tests take an eternity to grade - I can't possibly do it in the time the Registrar makes me.  Aw, what the hell, I'll just give everyone a B and see if they notice.  Old woman on a tour of Harvard Law School: I agree with the one who said he liked winter term.  I love this month because when I walk around campus now it actually looks like people are doing some learning.  There's 1Ls leaping off the roof of the library, there's 2Ls and 3Ls sleeping in the back of the classrooms, it's great, it's like a real school, and besides the fact that my feet are frozen to the ground and I've developed a case of whooping cough from the cold, I have some great academic-looking photos that I can share back with my girlfriends in Florida, who all wished they could come up here with me for a tour of the Law School but instead had to finish up their papers for their winter classes before they died.  Democratic presidential candidate: I agree with the old woman, especially if she's registered to vote in Iowa or New Hampshire.  No, seriously, I love winter term because it keeps these law professors busy so they don't have time to question any of my policy proposals that make no sense.  Imagine if I had to deal with op-eds every day about how the Constitution won't really let me appoint three vice-presidents or impose a tax on being Methodist.  It would be a real bummer.  So instead I get to make nonsensical proclamations about annexing Iraq as the fifty-first state without anyone challenging me in print.  Winter term is awesome.  And I approved this message because I believe in the rights of all people of New Hampshire, even if they live in Boston.  Harvard Square hobo: Winter term sucks.  No breakfast for me since no students are out between nine in the morning and noon.  How can I possibly afford my egg and cheese bagel from Au Bon Pain if there are no students out to give me their spare change?  Plus, it's really cold and I'm losing an average of a toe a day.  It's really no fun.  I don't even want to think about what starts falling off after I have no more toes.

      I was hanging out with one of my friends while he was having a text-message conversation over his cell phone.  What a horribly inefficient way of communicating.  2-2-2-2-2-2-2 3-3-3 7-7-7-7-7-7-7 4 6-6-6-6-6.  Oh, hello to you too.  Fifteen minutes to ask someone what the weather's like.  Ten things that text messaging would be especially lousy for:  10. "No, he said it with sarcasm... like this... but with sarcasm... can you picture it?" 9. "The comet -- it's passing right... now!  I mean... now!  Aw, you missed it... now!  Now!" 8. "My favorite song's on the radio!  I'll text you the lyrics... I love Eminem..."  7. "Yeah, there were about a hundred people there... yeah, let me tell you all their names..." 6. "So thenMcGrady passed it to Ewing, and Ewing passed it back to Nowitzki, and then, with ten seconds to go..." 5. "I'll take the Kung Pao Chicken... no garlic... with an order of dumplings... no, I want brown rice instead of fried rice." 4. "OK, so those were the multiple choice answers... now here's the essay..." 3. "Yeah, yeah, let me give you the whole shopping list..." 2. "Here's the URL: http, colon, two dashes, w-w-w-dot..." 1. "There's a fire in my building.  The room is filling up with smoke.  I can't get out.  Please send a fire truck.  Here is the address..."

       The Demiddlification of Law School.   Law school has no middle.  There's definitely a beginning.  You get here as a 1L, everything is new, meet new people, figure out what law school is all about, reading casebooks, checking footnotes, finding your place.  Definitely a beginning.  And there's definitely an end.  You have a job offer waiting for you, you're on your way out, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel (or the big black void, depending on your point of view, but I'm trying to keep this light today).  But what's in between?  Because the recruiting process is so early, there's kind of no middle, when you're neither on your way in or your way out.  Nothing too profound, just a thought.

      Over at  urlLink En Banc  the other day, I posted a song parody of Stevie Wonder's "Signed, Sealed, Delivered" making fun of Howard Dean keeping his gubernatorial records sealed.  Here's something marginally funnier (that's not saying much), about all the debates the Democratic candidates have been having:  To the tune of "Scarborough Fair (Parsley, Sage, Rosemary, and Thyme)" by Simon & Garfunkel:  Are we having another debate? Moseley Braun, Kucinich, and Clark Al Sharpton, Lieberman, Edwards, and Dean Gephardt, Kerry; Bob Graham dropped out.  Ask what they think of the war in Iraq    (And if they think it's good we caught Saddam Hussein)  If the state should pay for health care    (Let's take the profit out, Kucinich says)  Tax cuts are bad? Or tax cuts are good?    (Tax cuts are bad when the richest pay less)  Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs    (Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, war)   Tell them to seal up my records of old     (Tell them federal matching funds, not what I need)  Bush hates trees, and animals too    (He's dumping poisons in rivers and streams)  Go to the left and I'll tack to the right     (Balance the primary with what comes next)  Caucus, primary, caucus, please vote  Are we having another debate? Moseley Braun, Kucinich, and Clark Al Sharpton, Lieberman, Edwards, and Dean Gephardt, Kerry; Bob Graham dropped out.

      To whoever found my weblog twenty-three minutes ago by Google-searching for "wears adult diapers," I don't, I swear.  Not that there's anything wrong with them, if you do.  But I'm really not sure if you're going to find any information about them anywhere on here, unless you're planning on wearing them to law school.  And even then, while you might learn a bit about life at law school, you're not going to find anything oriented specifically for the problems you may face as a wearer of adult diapers, like an answer to your question about whether the seats are waterproof, or how good the ventilation system is so that the occasional accident won't lead to embarassment in front of your classmates, or whether Harvard's bookstore sells adult diapers with the school's insignia right next to the hats and scarves, or whether you should use the normal garbage pails or the recycling bins for disposal.  Sorry.  But enjoy the song parodies.

      Totally random notes:  1. They have free coffee, tea, and hot chocolate in the classroom buildings every morning.  So with my three-hour class starting each day at 9:00, and it being about 14 degrees Kelvin outside, I've been grabbing a cup of tea the past couple of days (I'm not into coffee; I'd rather be a little sleepy in the morning if it means I've got no problems falling asleep at night).  So today I put in a little bit of what I assumed was sugar, from one of those glass sugar containers with the little metal spout.  But I noticed when I was drinking it that it was really, really sweet.  I didn't think I'd put in that much sugar, but....  So at the break we've got in the middle of class I went to refill -- it wasn't sugar; it was Equal.  Man, that stuff is powerful.  2. There's a terrorism class in a room across the hall from mine.  I don't know the professor who teaches it, but I think there'd be a good joke to be made if it turns out that the professor teaching the terrorism course is truly terrifying.  Sorry.

       A Democratic Debate Sketch   No offense intended.  This is all in jest.  I have no agenda.  I'm just trying to be funny.   All nine candidates are on stage.  The lights come up.     DAN RATHER: Jumping jehosophats!  It's more crowded than Michael Jackson's bed!  Welcome to tonight's debate between the nine leading Democratic candidates.  We're coming to you live from a granary in the middle of a square state that normally never gets on the news except for this weird primary system we've got in this darn country.  Let's begin right away with opening statements, since I'm hungrier than a fat man at Disneyworld and I want to finish this before my most recent face lift starts to sag.  We'll start with you, Senator Edwards.  JOHN EDWARDS: Thank you, Dan.  And thank you to the good people of Iowa for hosting the nine of us this evening.  If there's one thing I've learned on the campaign trail this season, it's how many people really do get me confused with that guy on the SciFi network who talks to dead people.  But if there's two things I've learned, it's how special the good people of Iowa really are.  There's nobody smarter than an Iowa caucus voter.  Nobody.  And I'm here to tell you that despite the fact that I spent most of my career as a trial lawyer, profiting off the misfortunes of others, I am the one candidate on this stage who can stand up for the little people.  Little people like you, Congressman Kucinich.  I want to move America forward, move this nation ahead, and move this country in a direction we can all identify on a compass.  Thank you.  DAN RATHER:  Your move, Congressman Gephardt, and then we'll just continue in that direction while I take a quick break to reapply my stage makeup and switch to my "evening teeth."  DICK GEPHARDT: Thanks, Dan.  I'm as white as a ghost.  I really am.  It's hard to believe that just thirty-six years ago, I stood on this very stage for the first time, in my inauguaral run for the Presidency back in 1968.  Since that time, I've learned a great deal about this country, about myself, and about the good people who vote in the Iowa caucuses.  Together, from this stage, we've seen a man walk on the moon, the loss of famed comic actor John Candy, and the dawn of the Internet Age.  I have waited my turn.  And now it is my time.  I ceded the floor to Walter Mondale, to Michael Dukakis, to Bill Clinton, to Al Gore, but I will not lose to Carol Moseley Braun.  No, 2004 is the Year of the Gephardt, and under my leadership, I'll take Iowa -- and my home state of Missouri -- and make you the only two states in the union.  With your support, I'll annex the eastern half of the country for Iowa and the western half for Missouri, and together create a super-nation, to defend the rights of workers, lower taxes for the middle-class, and never, ever raise the retirement age.  I pledge to you that even if science eradicates all disease and we live until the age of 850, you will get your social security checks at age 65, even if I have to rob a bank to pay for it.  That's the Gephardt promise.  Long retirements, except for me, until I win a Democratic nomination.  Thank you.  CAROL MOSELEY BRAUN:  Look around this stage and what do you see?  Look carefully, and you'll notice that one of these things is not like the others.  Eight men.  Eight white men, except for Mr. Sharpton.  All with reasonably legitimate qualifications to be President, except for Mr. Sharpton and Congressman Kucinich.  And then there's me.  A one-term Senator who lost her re-election campaign and got sent to New Zealand.  Do you think they send rising stars in the party to New Zealand?  When they're looking to beef up someone's resume for a future run for the White House, do they ask them to go be ambassador to New Zealand?  Before I was banished to the land of the platypus, I couldn't even find New Zealand on a map.  When they told me where I was going, I looked at them like they had said I was going to Mars.  At least now there's a TV camera on Mars.  In New Zealand all they have is water and island.  I don't even know how I got there.  I blacked out on the plane and woke up in the mouth of a platypus.  It was scary.  I want to be your President so I don't have to go back to New Zealand.  Please don't let them send me back there.  AL SHARPTON:  I am the most entertaining thing about the Democratic Party these days.  That is sad.  But I am glad.  Not mad.  Because I never had.  So many television cameras following me before.  Except when I was in trouble.  Ross Perot is probably sitting at home wondering how I replaced him as the guy in these debates for entertainment purposes only.  He didn't get the memo.  I missed one debate and I heard it was pretty boring.  I'm going to do a cartwheel now.  Thank you.  DENNIS KUCINICH:  Why have they put me after Carol and Al?  I'm not like them.  I have a website.  www.socialized-medicine.com.  Go to my website.  Read my plan.  You'll see that I want to take the profit out of health care.  Doctors should make the same amount of money as Iowa farmers.  Before the subsidies.  Like most Americans, I go to Canada when I get sick.  Because socialized medicine works.  My campaign has no money, but I like it that way.  We don't need an economy built around money.  Capitalism is overrated.  We need barter.  I'll trade you my left arm for a hundred thousand votes.  How about that?  They say I'm unelectable, but I'm only unelectable because no one will vote for me.  We can fix that problem.  All I need to do is dress up like Howard Dean and then maybe Time and Newsweek will write stories about me instead of the two-page spread I got in the J.C. Penney Catalog-Magazine last month.  I also need a new wife.  To support my campaign and buy me fresh tofu.  I can't afford new tofu.  All of my tofu is old.  Vote for me and you'll never get sick again.  Socialized medicine can do that.  JOE LIEBERMAN:  Is this a great country or what?  I was almost Vice President.  Isn't that amazing?  I love this country!  If only the voting machines in Florida worked, I wouldn't have to spend a year of my life sharing a stage with Dennis Kucinich and eating kosher hot dogs at every roadside shack in Iowa and New Hampshire to prove to you people that I'm just a Regular Joe.  Instead, I'd be sitting in the Vice Presidential mansion, lighting the menorah and thanking God for all of my blessings.  I can't believe I was almost Vice President.  I would have been a great Vice President.  I would have gone to all of the weddings, and the funerals, and the bar and bat mitzvahs.  Oh, the bar and bat mitzvahs.  You know who's not getting invited to my daughter's bat mitzvah?  Al Gore.  And to think: I slept with him for that spot on the ticket, and this is how he repays me?  GENERAL WESLEY CLARK:  Thank you, Iowa.  Three months ago, probably none of you had ever heard of me.  You'd heard rumblings that there was going to be a new candidate entering the race, but nobody knew who I was.  Do you know why?  Because I'm not a real person.  I've been invented from whole cloth by the moderate wing of the Democratic party in consultation with Senator Hillary Clinton, who actually lives inside this costume I'm wearing and supplies my words into the automatic voice generator.  You see, the DLC looked at the past two hundred years of election data and came up with the perfect candidate.  Military experience, no extreme views, a nice smile, well-groomed eyebrows, and a generic name.  In the test runs I was Hank Clark, but now with the whole metrosexual thing we thought Wesley would appeal more to the female audience.  Sounds less threatening.  Yesterday I went in for a tuneup and they loaded in the wrong card.  So all I can talk about is football today.  They thought I was going to a dinner with Joe Namath.  I was supposed to go last week, but he tried to kiss me and it got awkward.  They meant to load in the health care card.  I don't know what it says.  My memory chip is all maxed out.  Sorry.  JOHN KERRY: I am a tall man.  Usually, they put me next to Dennis and I look like a giant.  But I asked them to stop doing that because it was scaring my children when they saw me on TV.  It was also scaring my wife, so she bought a new TV that makes me look shorter.  It was expensive.  But she's rich.  I am the only candidate on this stage who is a Senator from Massachusetts.  I am also the only candidate who is tall.  They say that usually the taller candidate wins the election.  That means you should vote for me.  That's the best reason I've got.  Vote for me.  Because I'm tall.  HOWARD DEAN: I just received word that they have revived Josef Stalin and brought him back to life and he is terrorizing Russia and killing millions of people, and threatening to do the same thing here.  I think we should stay out of it.  We are not the world's policemen.  He is not that dangerous.  As long as he doesn't unseal my gubernatorial records, I think we'll all be safe.  We should ignore him.  We should also ignore lots of the stupid things I sometimes say when I'm speaking off the cuff.  My campaign manager, Joe Trippi, who hates it when I mention his name Joe Trippi and then the NY Times writes glowing articles about him Joe Trippi, he gave me new cuffs so I wouldn't speak off the cuff as much.  These cuffs are long.  Almost as long as the confederate flags they fly down in the backwards South with all those religion nutjobs.  I talked about the religious nutjobs a lot when I was governor, but I sealed my records so you'll never find out.  I also think we should invite Josef Stalin over for tea because he's not dangerous at all and we also don't need a military or any weapons.  We should spend the money on better glue for my records instead.  DAN RATHER: Thanks for joining us.  We now return to an all-new episode of "Becker," already in progress.   Blackout

       Goofus and Gallant go to law school.    When I was a kid, I used to read Highlights magazine.  They had a cartoon series about two kids named Goofus and Gallant.  Goofus would always mess stuff up, while Gallant was the perfect child.  What if they went to law school?   Gallant always shows up to class on time, quietly takes his seat, plugs his laptop into the nearest outlet, and takes out his neatly-highlighted casebook and compact set of handwritten case briefs.  Goofus shows up fifteen minutes late, trips on the stairs down the aisle, knocks the pretty girl's coat off the back of her seat, accidentally drops his laptop's power cord into his cup of coffee, starts a fire, and burns down the law school.  Gallant does the reading every night, takes careful notes, and spends each afternoon updating his concise and well-organized class outline, in preparation for the eventual exam.  Goofus orders the casebook on half.com but ends up getting the wrong edition, doesn't figure it out until six weeks into the term when he first opens it, buys an outline off a classmate, experiments with LSD the morning of the exam, and ends up with the same grade as Gallant anyway.  Gallant buys a brand new suit for 2L interviews, along with matching shoes, and the hair gel that the Fab Five told him to get when he went on Queer Eye for the Straight Guy as part of the summer program at the firm he worked after 1L year.  Goofus wears a dog collar to the interview, tells the firm he thinks they didn't deserve their top-ten Vault ranking, and urinates on his interviewer's leg.  He doesn't get an offer, but at least he has a good story to tell.  Gallant graduates summa cum laude and goes on to make partner at a prestigious Wall Street law firm.  Goofus dies happy.

       urlLink This lawyer  has a funny post on his weblog (January 6, "The Milk Post") about how being a well-paid lawyer means he can buy expensive and delicious milk.  I think this pretty much says it all about these big law firms:   I have become a junkie of that gourmet milk they sell in Citarella... It's a whopping $4.99 for a quart. But it is liquid heaven.   This, my friends, is why people never leave law firms. The lifestyle sucks, but you get used to that [] expensive milk that tastes like a milkshake. Damn these golden handcuffs! The brackets in the second paragraph are replacing a bad word.  Lawyers are allowed to use bad words that law students aren't.

      The  urlLink Washington Post  had a list for the New Year of what's OUT (like: Mutual Funds) and what's IN (like: Google's IPO).  Lists like this are stupid.  But here's a law-school-related one anyway.  OUT  /  IN  Johnnie Cochrane  /  Mark Geragos Civil Procedure  /  Advanced Civil Procedure LSAT test prep classes  /  Studying on your own Article 2  /  Article 9 The Model Penal Code  /  The Federal Rules of Evidence Take-home exams  /  Writing a paper Hats in class  /  Scarves in class Snood  /  Super Text Twist Affirmative Action  /  Diversity Panels  /  Cold-calling Grades  /  Effort Lunch  /  Dinner Lexis  /  Nexis Higher U.S. News ranking  /  Higher tuition State law  /  Federal law Souter  /  Breyer Footnotes  /  Endnotes Paper  /  Ink Reading cases  /  Not wearing underwear Fletcher v.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  notes that we're in the same Winter Term class.  Should be fun.  Maybe we can get some cross-blog debates going about the merits and deficiencies of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code.  Maybe not.  :)  Actually, if I was in the mood for an ego-bruising, I'd figure out some way to get a poll up so anyone who reads both of our blogs could vote on who they think'll do better on the final exam.  :)  I'm not serious.

      I donated $10 to a presidential candidate yesterday.  I'm not sure if I should say which one.  I've never donated any money to a political campaign before (and it's not like my $10 is going to really make a difference -- although what could a 30-second ad on New Hampshire public access television cost? :) but I figured why not.  This way, even if I never get a chance to vote for the particular candidate I like best, I can say that I did something.

      Today was the first day of "Winter Term" here.  What, you ask, is Winter Term?  Well.  1Ls have exams after break.  2Ls and 3Ls have exams before break.  And so we have three weeks in January where we get to (get to!  I mean have to!) take another class.  Three weeks, classes meet every day, same number of total classroom hours as a normal class but instead of twice a week for an hour and a half each session for 15 weeks, it's 3 hours a day, every day (no weekends) for 3 weeks.  They do this in part so they can get some guest professors in who can't come for a whole semester but can do this 3 week thing and teach some different and special courses (like Food and Drug Law, which is a popular one here).  Or so people can do cool clinical stuff.  Or the Negotiations Workshop, 9AM-5PM every day, pass/fail, no exam.  But a lot of classroom time.  Ouch.  And they also have normal classes taught by regular professors, but condensed.  I'm taking one of those.  Secured Transactions.  With reading and a problem set every night.  And an exam at the end.  So that's what I'm up to for the next three weeks.  That was so unfunny.  But I guess there are probably some people out there reading for content.  ;)

      I saw "Lost In Translation" this evening.  Along with just 9 of the 170 reviewers on Rotten Tomatoes, I wasn't thrilled.  "Dreadfully boring," were my words, I think, which may be unfair.  The first chunk was kind of amusing, a little bit.  I thought the rest of it dragged on, and on, and on... which may just mean I missed something, or I'm not as smart as Roger Ebert.  Back in Boston, by the way, for anyone following closely.  800 words on Harvard's "winter term" and/or the new year coming tomorrow morning if I can summon the inspiration.

      Sherry over at Stay of Execution has an  urlLink excellent post  which she says is about how to get a job as a lawyer in a small market, but I think it's really pretty applicable to anyone looking for a job doing anything.  There's nothing either law-specific or small-market-specific so much as it's small-world-specific -- applicable to anyone looking to do something in an industry that's relatively small, where connections help.  It's about networking and informational interviews and all that fun stuff.  Okay, I'm going to stop talking about the post; just go read it if you think it's relevant to you.  You can thank me later.  Since I'm heading back to school tomorrow, I'm ending the "e-mail me if you want my Vault Guide" contest I posted about last week when everyone was home for break and not reading my weblog.  I got three e-mails from interested people.  One of them will soon be the owner of a Vault Guide.  I'll offer up another piece of law-student-paraphenalia I once needed but now find useless sometime in the near future.  You can one day benefit from crap I bought because I was nervous about law school.  LEEWS, anyone?  And, finally, I'm a couple of days late here, but FINALLY, here are some New Years resolutions.  For real.  I owe you some raw honesty if you've decided to come back and read after the holidays.  My counter graph looks like a terrifying roller coaster drop over the last couple of weeks.  So... in no particular order:  1.  Less Internet.  I read too much junk.  I waste too much time.  I reload my counter too often.  I check my e-mail too compulsively.  I'll keep the sites I really value, but I really am going to make a conscious effort to stop the random stuff.  Other people watch too much TV.  TV I have under control.  But six sports sections to find all of the articles about the Mets is simply unnecessary.  Amazon.com recommendation engine, I'm looking at you here.  Banished to the cellar, sorry.  2.  More focus.  This is related to #1.  I want to make better use of my time so that I get more things done.  I'm pretty productive once I'm doing something.  The problem is forcing myself to do it without stopping after ten minutes to check e-mail, go to the bathroom, eat lunch, or relace my sneakers.  This may mean more library time without the ethernet cord.  But whatever it takes.  Taskmastering.  That's my new made-up word for 2004.  3.  More risks.  I wanted to do a less-more-less-more pattern here, but that's not working out.  Anyway.  I don't take enough risks.  I don't drink milk past its date (or anywhere close to its date, really -- three days after it's been opened I start to get concerned) even though rationally I know it's probably fine.  That's probably not going to change.  And I really can't think of any risks I don't take that I really want to take.  But maybe that's the problem.  I don't know what this resolution means.  I don't know if I'm actually resolving anything.  Nevermind.  This one doesn't count.  4.  More songwriting.  Not these parody songs that appear on here every so often.  Real songs.  I've been woefully unproductive on that front lately.  5.  More people.  I like the friends I have.  I've met a lot of great people at law school, to add to the great people that I met before law school.  But as a 2L you meet less new people because the friends you've made as a 1L are still around.  So it's harder to make the effort.  I want to make the effort.  There are lots of cool people here, I'm certain, that I don't know at all.  There have been a good number of times in my life when I've met someone and we click and it's cool.  I like that.  I don't want to have to strain to think about when the last time that happened was.  It takes me some effort sometimes.  I'm quiet sometimes.  My new years resolution is to make the effort more.  6.  More appreciation.  I'm pretty fortunate, or lucky, or something like that.  I should give more quarters to homeless people.  7.  More vitamins.  I keep forgetting to take them.  OK, I'm degenerating into trying-to-be-funny when I don't mean to.  That means I should stop.  Happy 2004.  And thanks for reading.  Hope I continue to be worth the effort.

      It seems like most of the weblogs I've looked at over the past few days have some sort of "Best of 2003" list.  So I thought I may as well join the club.  BEST LEGAL WORD I LEARNED IN 2003: "Easement" BEST MEAL IN THE LAW SCHOOL CAFETERIA: The purple things with the brown sauce and white stuff BEST LAW SCHOOL: Florida International University, because one of the professors e-mailed me in response to a post BEST LAW SCHOOL RANKINGS: U.S. News BEST CASEBOOK: Tie -- "Property," "Bankruptcy" BEST LEGAL REGIME OF 2003: Constitutional democracy BEST LAW: The one against cars driving on the sidewalk, because otherwise walking outside would suck BEST LAWYER: The hiring partner at the firm where I accepted my summer offer BEST WAY TO JUSTIFY LAW SCHOOL TO FAMILY: Telling them what a summer associate gets paid BEST LEGAL RESOURCE: Library BEST LOCATION TO PRACTICE LAW: Courtroom BEST THING THAT IS LEGAL: Tie -- sleeping, eating BEST LAW-RELATED TV SHOW: "Judging Amy" (I'm serious -- it's really good!) BEST LAW-RELATED SONG: "The Remedy" (Jason Mraz)  Yes, I'm kind of stupid.

       A Democratic Debate Parody  (scroll down for comments on the real thing)  DAN RATHER: Welcome to the 27th Democratic Debate of the 2004 primary season.  With us this morning are Senator John Kerry and Senator John Edwards -- and two other people we're just going to ignore.  Senator Kerry, let me start with you.  The National Journal just released a report calling you the most liberal Senator in the Senate.  Senator Kerry, would you call yourself a Senator?  SEN. KERRY: I don't think the American people want this campaign to be about labels, Dan.  DAN RATHER: So you would not call yourself a Senator?  SEN. KERRY: I would call myself a fighter for the American people, but, no, I'm not going to make this campaign about political labels.  DAN RATHER: Senator Edwards, is Senator Kerry a Senator?  SEN. EDWARDS: I believe he is, Dan.  And I believe he's been one for a long time, in Washington.  Washington is an evil place, Dan.  And Senator Kerry has been a Senator there for a long time.  In Washington.  Ooooh.  DAN RATHER: Now, Senator Edwards---  SEN. KERRY: Excuse me.  Let me step in and defend myself here, Dan.  I've just been attacked.  Senator Edwards has pulled out a baseball bat and is currently attacking me.  I need to defend myself.  I may be from Washington, and I may have $400 million in the bank, but I refuse to be called a Senator.  That's not the kind of name-calling the American people want.  REP. KUCINICH: I'd like to get a few words in here, if I may.  DAN RATHER: No, you may not.  REP. KUCINICH: Okay, then.  DAN RATHER: Senator Edwards, Senator Kerry has now won 18 of 20 primaries, and you've won one.  Some people say you're just angling for the Vice Presidential nomination.  If you lose all of the primaries up to the convention, do not receive the nomination, and watch President Bush win re-election over Senator Kerry, will you drop out of the race?  SEN. EDWARDS: I don't believe ---  DAN RATHER: You don't believe?  A follow-up on that if I can.  Do you mean you don't believe in---  SEN. EDWARDS: I'd like the opportunity to finish.  DAN RATHER: I'd like the opportunity to interrupt you.  SEN. EDWARDS: I just need thirty seconds.  I don't believe the voters have finish speaking in this election.  There are two Americas, Dan.  There's the America where John Kerry has won 18 of 20 primaries, and there's the America where I still have a chance at the nomination.  Some may say that second America just lives in my head, but I believe it is real and it is strong and I will fight for that America to become the one America.  REV. SHARPTON: I believe there's more than two Americas, Senator Edwards.  I believe there's a third America, where I'm actually a legitimate candidate for this nomination---  DAN RATHER: I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut you off, Reverend Sharpton.  REV. SHARPTON: You will NOT cut me off, Dan.  I've been sitting here patiently while you've been going back and forth between Senator Kerry and Senator Edwards, ignoring the fact that I am here --  REP. KUCINICH: Me too!  REV. SHARPTON: Shut up, Dennis.  Dan, you've been ignoring the fact that I am here.  The voters have a right to choose.  The media, by ignoring my candidacy, is telling the voters that I am not a legitimate candidate.  And that, my friends, is illegitimate!  DAN RATHER: Very well.  The next question is to you, Senator Kerry.  It's about a woman's right to vote.  Do you believe women should be able to be voters?  SEN. KERRY: It's about rights, Dan, not terminology.  I believe women should have the right to cast a ballot in the Presidential election just like a man can.  I believe they should be able to choose their preferred candidate, and have that selection counted toward the determination of who wins the election.  But if you're asking me if we should call them voters, well, on that point I have to disagree.  It's about rights, not terminology.  DAN RATHER: Senator Edwards?  SEN. EDWARDS: I believe I'm in full agreement with Senator Kerry on this one, but let me just add that I think it's a state issue.  If a state wants to call its women who cast ballots "voters," then that's great; if they want to call them "eggplant," that's fine too.  DAN RATHER: Reverend Sharpton, you get the last word on this.  REV. SHARPTON: Thank---  DAN RATHER: Excellent.  Moving on.  Senator Kerry, pundits have been saying that you are not as lickable as Senator Edwards.  SEN. KERRY: I'm sorry.  Lickable?  DAN RATHER: Excuse me.  I mean likable.  People have said Senator Edwards is more likable than you.  That you don't have the charisma, the personality, the charm to be an effective leader.  What do you say to those critics, and what have you learned from Senator Edwards on the campaign trail?  SEN. KERRY: I don't believe I have a likability problem at all, and I think anyone who accuses me of that is just too poor to identify with me.  I think people at cocktail parties and state dinners like me very much, and any of them will tell you so just as soon as I pay them to.  I don't think I've learned anything from Senator Edwards except that maybe I should dye my hair brown, because his hair does look pretty good for a man his age, I have to admit.  DAN RATHER: Similarly, Senator Edwards, people have said you lack the experience to be President, especially foreign policy experience, given that you've only been in the Senate for one term.  What do you say to those people?  SEN. EDWARDS: I say there are two Americas, Dan.  There's an America where we need leaders who have experience, and there's an America where a man like me, an honest man, a good man, a man whose father was a millworker and whose mother was a windmill, who can rise up and make a difference.  I say there's an America where the guy with $400 million wins the nomination, and there's an America where the guy with just $36 million wins the nomination.  These are my two Americas, Dan.  REP. KUCINICH: Don't forget about the America where a guy with $1.85 and a stale donut in his jacket pocket can win the nomination.  Because when I am the nominee---  REV. SHARPTON: Pigs will fly when you are the nominee, Dennis.  REP. KUCINICH: Yes they will, Al.  Because I am a vegan, and so I will give pigs the freedom to fly.  Pigs will also get universal health care and the right to a free college education.  And I will not send any pigs to Iraq, and Canadian pigs will not steal our jobs because I will recall NAFTA, burn it, and eat it.  As long as it is not made of meat.  DAN RATHER: Senator Edwards, you've gotten rich off of being a trial lawyer.  Do you think the people of America realize that there's a whole set of lawyers in this country who make a lot of money?  SEN. EDWARDS: I think they do, Dan.  I think they do in one America.  But in the other America, people don't have a chance to become lawyers, because the other America doesn't have any vowels, and so there are no lawyers, doctors, or teachers.  Just a lot of rhythm.  Sometimes.  When "Y" isn't a vowel.    DAN RATHER: Finally, a question for all of you.  Is Michael Jackson a pedophile?  SEN. KERRY: I don't believe in labels.  But, yes, I believe he is.  SEN. EDWARDS: I'm in full agreement with Senator Kerry on this one.  REV. SHARPTON: Sure, absolutely.  REP. KUCINICH: I think---  DAN RATHER: We're out of time.  Thanks so much to the candidates for joining us this morning.  Godspeed.

       Thoughts on the Democratic Debate   There's a  urlLink Democratic Debate  on CBS this morning.  I did "live commentary" for a couple of these on En Banc in the past, since the comment function sort of made that more fun, but since En Banc is no more... thought I'd do it here.  (Incidentally, in the past,  urlLink Pandagon  has done some very nice Live Debate Commentary -- don't see anything up there yet today, but you may want to check them out for more.   urlLink Daily Kos  also has a thread of comments on the debate.)  1. Dan Rather got a terribly short haircut.  He looks weird.  2. Sharpton nodded hello facing the wrong camera.    3. John Kerry looks and sounds really tired.  John Edwards just asked a question about religion with his standard "Two Americas" stump speech.  Sounded canned.  They all look and sound tired.  Maybe it's the 11 AM thing.  Maybe one of them will be too tired to realize what they're doing and say something stupid.  That's the only reason to watch.  George Carlin has a routine where he says the only reason people watch car racing is for the accidents.  Same thing here, I think.  4. Kerry really, really looks and sounds tired and cranky, and his Botox seems to have worn off.  He's channeling the crankiness of Bob Dole.  And that really worked in '96.  John Edwards is trying very hard to sound very knowledgable about Haiti, but the political reporters asking the questions seem to know more than he does.  5. Sharpton is arguing with the moderator, who's trying to move on from Sharpton and Kucinich back to Kerry and Edwards.  Why do they have to invite Sharpton and Kucinich when no one really wants to hear from them?  6. They've moved from Haiti on to "Super Tuesday" and whether Edwards wants to attack John Kerry, basically.  Edwards is invoking Trade as the big difference between the two candidates.  I don't know if Trade really resonates with every voter.  I know I don't think all that much about trade.  Tell me he's too rich, or he's too mean, or he's too old.  Trade agreements are too abstract.    7. What a dumb question Edwards just asked Kerry when given a chance to point out differences.  "Do you believe we're going to change this country from Washington, DC?"  Kerry said, "Yes.  And John Edwards has been in the Senate for 5 years, in Washington too."  Edwards blew this question, I think.  But Kerry still sounds old and cranky this morning, so I don't know that he's capitalizing as well as he could be on Edwards being off his game.  8. Edwards is still trying to point out differences in position on these different trade agreements that I have no idea what they mean and nobody does.  Why is he emphasizing trade so much to the exclusion of any other differences these two candidates may or may not have?  Is this the best he can come up with?  This is not working for Edwards.  Although he's energetic and trying and interrupting.  9. Dennis Kucinich is now saying NAFTA shouldn't exist and everyone else likes it, and he's the only one who doesn't.  Actually, Kucinich is the only one up there who sounds well-rested and articulate this morning.  He's crazy, but he's coming off well.  10. Kerry is arguing over budget numbers that were printed in the Washington Post.  Not so useful.  11. Al Sharpton is arguing for time and accusing the debate moderators of favoring Edwards and Kerry.  And he's getting effectively mad.  He's doing great.  He's super-entertaining.  He's complaining that he has to fight for time, and flustering Dan Rather.  12. Kerry is saying there's no difference between what he would do on trade and what Edwards would do on trade.  And saying that Edwards has talked in the last 5 weeks more about trade than ever before.  And that he didn't vote in 1994, which has little to do with trade but sounds good anyway.  He's got the last word in on this, at least so far, and even though he sounds cranky he sounds persuasive on this point, and is rendering Edwards' trade differences argument pretty much useless.  Edwards needed better differences to draw than on trade policy, I think.  His advisors should be feeling bad about this one, I think.  13. Moderator is asking Edwards if he can quantify the amount of jobs he'll save from going abroad, and he says "Of course not, no one can."  Which sounded weak.  But now he's making trade a personal issue -- "my family... an issue about families..." yeah, but everything is.  Trade is not the *biggest issue facing families* today.  It's facing workers, and, yeah, it's facing families, but eh...  14. Moderator has just asked Kerry about the National Journal survey that showed him as the #1 liberal in the Senate.  And he won't admit he's liberal, and he's saying labels are bad, and he's never heard anything so silly.  Come on, that's not realistic.  15. Kucinich just took advantage of the exchange and announced himself as a liberal and proud of it, a liberal for universal health care, etc.  Nice.  He's not doing badly in the very limited time they're giving him to talk, even though it won't actually get anyone to vote for him.  16. "This is actually a subject that John and I agree about" is something Edwards wins no points by saying.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.  Edwards is refusing to call Kerry a liberal, refusing to call himself a liberal.  Sharpton has the best comment on this issue -- "compared to President Bush, most everyone in this country is a liberal" or something to that effect.   17. A reader just e-mailed: "I'm going to vote for the Democratic nominee, but I can't imagine these four are persuading anyone this morning. "labels are so silly in American politics." -- Kerry. Um, if you're running for the Democratic nomination, shouldn't you want at least the (D) behind your name?"  Nice summary.  Thanks.  18. Dan Rather just accused Edwards of being rich.  And he joked that if you're going to list assets, he should list Kerry's assets too.  And now Kucinich is defending Edwards, and saying that even though he's made money that shouldn't disqualify him.  Sharpton did great to turn this into a bigger issue -- Edwards could go from poor to rich, but a lot of people can't, there are more than two Americas.  Edwards: "running so that millions of Americans get the same chances I got."  And now he's into his two Americas speech.  He's doing very well on this question, because it can go to his stump speech.  "Those of us who've had great luck moving up---" I'm not sure he really believes he's been successful because of "great luck," but I suppose it's not fair to quibble on that point.  He did a nice job witj the question.  19. Edwards has this finger-pointing thing that works better at a podium than sitting around a table.  20. Kerry -- "no draft, I will get us out of Iraq."  Kerry does sound reasonably intelligent on war issues.  He still sounds cranky, but he sounds more comfortable on defense and Iraq than he's sounded on the other questions.  "You can't just cut and run, Dennis."  "But I'm not."  "Then you've adopted my plan, Dennis."  Kerry's solid talking about this one.  21. Kerry is criticizing President Bush not going to any funerals of killed soldiers, or reaching out to the families.  Sharpton: "It's not about going to the funerals, it's about showing compassion... the real question though is why they were killed in the first place... you [in the Senate] gave him a blank check."    22. Edwards hasn't talked in a while.  Oh, there they go, they're asking him a question about terrorism.  Is no terrorist attacks since 9/11 luck or the President?  "President has done something... not done enough."  We need better jobs in our ports, he says.  Ports are boring.  Nuclear chemical plants that are vulnerable -- and now he's launching into special interests changing Bush's positions.  Chemical plants being attacked would be bad.  Edwards wanted to take action, Bush was swayed by special interests.  23. Sharpton says we can't give the President credit -- he was president when 9/11 happened, and shouldn't they have done more.  It's a nice point given the question.  But now of course they're all going to say we should have done more, he could have done more... and now Kerry is making an artless transition into job programs for minorities.  Nice point, bad segue.  24. Kucinich: "we are not safer because we attacked a country that did not attack us [and more al Qaeda has erupted...]."    25. Moderator asking Kerry about his likability.  What has be learned from Edwards about what's important when campaigning.  This is a horrible question -- why are they asking him why people don't like him, when he's winning all these primaries, and no one is going to admit they're not likable and talk about themselves in the critical third person in a presidential debate.  Weird question.  Which got an answer that of course it would get, "I'm likable.  Watch me on the campaign trail."  26. Followed up by a dumber question to Edwards -- does Kerry have enough charisma to beat Bush?  Stupid question.  Edwards: "I don't think this is a personality question... the American people are looking for someone who... shares their values."  Solid way to answer a stupid question.  "They know in their gut when someone's telling them the truth... they know who they can trust..." This sounds like an argument from "Shady Lawyers 101."  I don't trust Edwards when he says people should trust him, even though I like Edwards generally.  27. Gay marriage.  Kerry: "I believe marriage is between a man a woman... I'm for rights, not for terminology or status. SPousal rights... inheritance, taxes... being afforded to everyone."  Kucinich: "Equal protection clause... many Americans believe equality of opportunity should not be denied by sexual orientation... enable those privileges to be extended to everyone... show a capacity to expand... protect those people about to be excluded by the President."  They're asking Kerry what he would do if one of his children wanted to marry someone of the same gender: "I've been to weddings... I just have  a difference of opinion as to what to call it... I think all the civil rights should be afforded."  Sharpton: "I think that's states rights... I am for a constitutional right for human beings to decide who they want to be... it's not just who runs against the President, but what runs against the President, human rights."  Edwards: "I believe the Federal government should recognize the state decisions... definition of marriage has been defined by states... this is one place where Senator Kerry and I agree... up to the states to decide if marriage."  John Edwards: even if you and Kerry agree, STOP SAYING IT.  28. Foreign policy. North Korea.  Middle East.  Edwards: "The Israelis have a right to protect themselves."  Kucinich: "Peaceful coexistence, restart the peace talks."  29. Last question.  "Is God on America's side?"  Kerry: "We pray that God is on our side."  Edwards: "[Lincoln said] I'll join you in a prayer that we're on God's side."  Nice answer.  And sounded prepared, but that's ok I guess.  And that's it.  Hope  someone's  reading...   Debate parody coming later today.  :)

      Don Henley has a song on his 2000 album (Inside Job) called "Taking You Home," that could just as easily be about a take-home exam:   I had a good life Before you came I had my friends and my freedom I had my name Still there was sorrow and emptiness 'Til you made me glad Oh, in this love I found strength I never knew I had  And this love Is like nothing I have ever known Take my hand, love I'm taking you home I'm taking you home Well, at least the first two lines work.

       A Socratic Dialogue In Support of the Socratic Method    The clock on the wall says 4:52, so it's time to start.  Jeremy, can you tell me what the Socratic Method is?   Uh, is passing allowed?   No.   Okay.  Well, in theory, it's some sort of back-and-forth dialogue that Socrates wrote about, where the teacher's questions guide the students to an answer in some profound and metaphysical way.  In practice, it basically just means professors call on you to answer questions, as opposed to the opposite end of the spectrum, "volunteers only."   That's basically right, although a little wordy.  And what do you think of the Socratic Method?   Still me?   Am I looking at anyone else?   I suppose not.   I suppose not.  Yeah.  Stop stalling.   Sorry.  I think the Socratic method certainly keeps students on their toes.   Toes like on your feet?   Huh?   Just want you to clarify your point.   It keeps students awake, and alert.  It makes sure students have done the reading.   Did  you  do the reading?   Of course.   Are you lying to me?   Yes.  I'm sorry.  It won't happen again.   I know.  Because if it does, I'll make your life miserable by calling on you every single day.   I appreciate that.  Fear is motivating.   I know.  What else is motivating?   Praise.   Good answer.  That's right on point.  Nice job.  Now tell me what case the one you read for today reminds you of?   You mean you want me to read your mind.   Exactly.   Then I'll have to go with  Marbury v. Madison , the most famous case in all of Constitutional Law.   This is Evidence.   I know.   Do you really?   I guess not.   Should I call on someone else?   Please do.

      For no reason at all I'm up crazy late this evening.  I had an a cappella group rehearsal earlier, and we were talking about our spring concert -- traditionally we've chosen a charity to donate the relatively modest profits to.  I got a mixed reaction to my suggestion we choose the National Association for the Deaf.  Ponder that for a bit.  This evening, I went to see the Harvard Hasty Pudding show, "As The Word Turns."  Hasty Pudding is an undergraduate theater group at Harvard, now in its 156th year, that puts on an annual musical comedy written and performed by students, with lots of professional support in terms of director, set designer, costumes, choreographer, etc -- so production values are really quite tremendous.  It's all guys on stage, some playing female characters, and all dressing up for a kickline at the end -- I'm a little surprised they haven't had to go co-ed yet, but that's not really the point of my post.  I was in a similar group at Princeton called the Triangle Club -- Triangle has the all-male kickline as well, and the basic gist is the same -- student written and performed musical comedy with some professional support in terms of director and choreographer.  We were co-ed, incidentally.  And the genres are different.  Hasty Pudding follows a fairly consistent formula -- it's very pun-driven humor, a relatively simple plot, colorful costumes, very polished performances, an easy-to-follow book show, with lots of light laughs but it's not really trading in topical humor or high-concept.  It works very, very well for what it is -- it's a formula, and this year's show could have been performed 25 years ago and the audience wouldn't feel like it was out of place, but they played the formula very well.  Triangle tends to play more with sketches and songs that don't necessarily fall together into a book show, more with topical humor, college humor, toilet humor... more failure and less polish, but with that comes the potential for some more gems and more real super-satisfying moments -- I admit I'm more than biased.  But I have to admit that Hasty Pudding's on-stage acting, singing, and dancing was fantastic, extremely polished, their band was great, the costumes and sets were awesome, the lighting and sound very very solid -- I don't think Triangle necessarily comes up to their level in production value and in actual performance quality.  And the writing was solid -- it was well-executed to their formula -- well-crafted stuff, the music didn't stick with me as much as I wish it might have but I liked it, especially the ballads (I like ballads), and the rhymes were sometimes predictable but at no point forced or tortured -- again, though, I blame the style and formula for any shortcomings more than the writers.  And the formula works, so maybe I ought not blame anyone.  So overall I was entertained, but not blown away -- and felt some nostalgia for my undergrad experience in Triangle (as I often do).  No one really wanted to read that much about the Hasty Pudding show, I'm sure.  But there you have it.  Recommended, absolutely -- they perform through March 21st, student tickets $15.

      I'm frightened to think what kind of Google hits this post is going to get me, but I'm doing my Tax reading, innocently enough, and mentioned in one of the cases I'm reading (Raytheon Production Corp. v. Commissioner) cites a case whose name caused me to do a double take:  Swastika Oil and Gas Co. v. Commissioner .  From 1941.  A friend I showed this to, in disbelief, came up with a great line: "Uh, just what kind of  gas  exactly were they making?"  I imagine this company has gone out of business, or at least changed its name -- "no one's buying our gas!"  "maybe it's the flag we're flying outside all our service stations" -- I hope.  And, yes, that was the most interesting part of my tax reading.

      Dennis Kucinich spoke at the Law School today.  I went just for kicks, but it turned out the law school newspaper didn't have anyone else covering it, so some version of this will be in the paper tomorrow, but I thought I'd share the uncut version here:  On Wednesday afternoon, United States Congressman and Democratic presidential candidate Dennis Kucinich spoke to a standing-room-only Ames Courtroom crowd in an event sponsored by the HLS Democrats.  The audience was filled with not just students but Kucinich supporters from the broader community, wearing buttons, carrying signs, waving banners, and, perhaps in the case of one woman who coughed throughout the event, suffering from a lack of universal health care.  Many of the audience members wore leis to symbolize Kucinich's recent second-place triumph in the Hawaiian Democratic caucus, earning 30% of the vote, as opposed to the 1% he has been averaging in the continental forty-eight.  Kucinich entered the courtroom to a rousing standing ovation.  Once the crowd quieted down, he launched into a 15-minute speech that focused primarily on his stance against the war in Iraq and in favor of world peace more generally.  Kucinich told the audience that the upcoming election did not have to be a choice between a Republican war in Iraq or a Democratic one, but that the country could instead choose peace.  We can consciously create a new world I think people are ready for it, he said, and a deluge of applause followed.  Kucinich criticized current U.S. policy for putting the country on a platform separate from the rest of the world, and lording over other countries.  The candidate ran onto the elevated judges platform in Ames courtroom to illustrate the United States plans to watch over the world from space, and attack whenever a country did something the Bush administration did not agree with.  Kucinich outlined his plan to create a cabinet-level Department of Peace, which he said he initially proposed to Congress in July 2001, two months before the September 11th attacks.  The Department of Peace, he explained, would infuse the principles of peace into every aspect of society.  In school, children would be introduced to peace-making and peace-sharing programs starting in the early grades.  In homes suffering from domestic violence, abusers would be treated with "open-hearted compassion," with a focus on dealing not just with the effects of but with the underlying causes of violence in our society.  Internationally, the Department would work with the nations of the world to transform relationships, and, in the spirit of the original United Nations charter, end war for good.  The Congressman invoked quotations from Raplh Waldo Emerson, Lord Tennyson, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Descartes, and others, insisting that it should be the "conscious cause of the nation to deal with the peace crisis at home," and that we should use "our capacity to evolve" to "create a more perfect union" and achieve world peace.  He closed his speech by saying he wants to "carry the power of the human heart, and the human spirit, and go farther than we have ever gone."  After a sustained round of applause, Kucinich took questions from the audience.  One person asked whether he would consider running on a ticket with Ralph Nader.  Kucinich replied that he and Nader have been friends for thirty years, but "my nomination will make Ralph Nader's candidacy less necessary."  In response to a question about the legalization of drugs including cocaine, Kucinich said that he thought it was long overdue that we decriminalize marijuana, and that although he would deal with drug abusers with medical treatment instead of incarceration, he was "not there yet and may never be" as far as legalizing cocaine.  In response to a question about the budget, Kucinich said that he would cut Pentagon spending by at least 15%, cut war spending by removing our troops from Iraq, and roll back many of the Bush tax cuts in order to fund universal health care, universal 5-day-a-week child care for kids ages 3, 4, and 5, and make it possible for everyone to attend college tuition-free.  No word on whether that plan would include Harvard Law School.

      The rest of  "Walking in Class Late" (to the tune of Marc Cohn's "Walking In Memphis")  [I tried.  This is not that thrilling, I know.  But I tried.]  Alarm clock did not ring The time I slept right past I thought I would do all the reading be- -fore class but I'm not that fast Though I am on panel - what's the chance she'll call on me? Cause I got a friendly smile And I'm as clueless as I can be  And I'm walking in class late  Tripping on a backpack, coat, and chair  Walking in class late  But do I really know why I am there?  Saw the ghost of Posner In the comment someone made Then as she called on the person next to me Real silently, I prayed Now perhaps she will not see me If I slump down in my seat If she calls my name I'll hang my head in shame And go down to defeat  Cause I was walking in class late  Didn't do the reading yesterday Walking in class late  I do not have a clever thing to say  She's got three prongs on the blackboard And she's looking right at me I turn the page; the page is useless There is nothing there to see I wish I'd stayed in bed more  Now teacher she points my direction And she says something about a case It's a case I've never heard of And she sees it on my face I mouth the words "please save me" And her eyes move one row back She says "Tell me 'bout this decision" And my world just fades to black  I won't be walking in class late  I'll take my one free pass and go from there Walking in class late  Someone up above answered my prayer  Walking in class late  The moral of the story is as goes Walking in class late No one who's on panel ever shows.

      Just FYI: my guest-blog stint at  urlLink Crescat Sententia  has been graciously extended indefinitely.  Nothing changes here; I'm honored to have been asked to stick around over there, and their ever-growing cast of excellent contributors means that I get the low-pressure privilege to post only when the mood strikes and not just for the sake of seeing my name in bright orange.  So when something I read over there sparks something, I'll probably post a thought.  But I'll flag anything of note, and, of course, this is still the home base.  No worries.  Incidentally, stay tuned for some news about En Banc: The Next Generation in the next couple of days.

      The library's online catalog is telling me I didn't return a book that I returned.  I'm sure I returned it.  So at some point today (since I've renewed the book the maximum amount of times just hoping they'd find it and erase it and I wouldn't have to bother) I'm going to see if they think I'm lying or not when I tell them I returned the book.  I'll actually sort of be disappointed (from a theoretical perspective, not really actually disappointed) if this is very easy and they just erase it off the record, because that means people can just steal books whenever they want and then tell the library they returned them.  But I really didn't steal this book.  I mean, it was for a journal article I was footnote-checking.  It's about environmental regulation.  Why would I want this book?  Why would anyone want this book?  If it was the 18th century papers of President Washington, then, sure, maybe I'd want to steal the book and sell it on E-Bay. But this book is relatively modern, surely worthless in monetary value even if not worthless in scholarly value.  Although even in scholarly value I have my doubts.  I actually remember returning it.  I have a very detailed story I can tell them about taking it out of my room, bringing it to the library, and putting it in the drop slot.  That's actually about as detailed as the story gets.  It was a little paperback book, so even if they don't believe me and they make me pay for it I can just chalk it up to balancing the bonus I got in Tax class because we're using a book that hasn't been published yet and so we got it for free and didn't have to buy a $90 casebook.  So it's not like I'll really be upset if they don't believe me.  But I returned the book.  They must have scanned it back in wrong.  Which, I guess, means maybe it's on the shelf and I should go look for it, and then I can just return it again.  Hmm.  Maybe I'll try that.  I doubt it'll be there.  If I had a bar code printing machine I could do all sorts of deceptive stuff with library books. I suppose there's been some sort of bar code cheating scandal somewhere in the world at some time.  Who knows. Hopefully something more interesting will happen to me today so that I can do better than a story about a library book that I returned.

       Book Recommendation: "Clinton and Me"   I'm very hard to please.  It surprises me when I want to effusively praise something.  I intended to read for a half hour last night and then get to sleep early for my 8:30 class this morning.  I could not put the book down.  I devoured it.  My light went off at two in the morning.  This book is terrific.    Briefly, "Clinton and Me" is the story of Mark Katz, who, just out of college, volunteered for the Dukakis for President campaign in '88, and impressed his way into a role on the campaign's rapid-response team, coming up with sound bites and one-liners.  People remembered his work, and four years later, after President Clinton's election, he found himself writing Madeleine Albright's speech for the Gridiron Club, an annual event where high-powered politicos say funny things.  The President loved it.  For the next eight years, Mark Katz was Clinton's hired-gun for the annual humor circuit, writing jokes for the President of the United States.  Fantastic job, of course.  And the book is full of funny one-liners and stories, excerpts from what made it into the speeches, and what didn't.  And I laughed.  But that's not what makes the book terrific.  What makes the book terrific is that the reader feels what it's like to step into Mark Katz's shoes, and see this world of power and privilege though the eyes of someone who feels humbled and privileged to be there.  He gives these people he comes into contact with depth and dimension and makes them real.  Al Gore is a human being in this book, not a caricature.  President Clinton is a human being.  Books don't normally do this.  He makes you feel how he was feeling and see what he was seeing and... I couldn't put it down.  And it was funny.   urlLink Buy the book .

       "Bar/Bri" [to the tune of Barry Manilow's "Mandy"]   I remember autumn days  My eyes met your focused gaze Sitting at the desk, with piles of pamphlets Promises I'd pass, and be a lawyer  Springtime came, the price didn't rise Watched as you'd divert your eyes The free books didn't help, my grades got lower The highlighters you gave, they ran out of ink  Oh Bar/Bri  Well, you said that your price would be rising I should sign up today Oh, Bar/Bri Well, you dangled free goodies before me Had no choice but to pay Oh, Bar/Bri  I'm sitting in the Bar/Bri class  The teacher says he's sure I'll pass But the teacher isn't real, a screen I'm watching It's all on video, for this they charge  Oh, Bar/Bri Well, you lock me inside every day now Teaching law that I know Oh, Bar/Bri How much more do you want me to pay now Will you please let me go? Oh, Bar/Bri  Hours in the room, I'm almost crying Weeks inside the room, and my soul is dying  Oh, Bar/Bri Would have passed but for all of this torture Watching tapes every day Well you charged me much more than you helped me Failed the test anyway [I got fired today...] Oh, Bar/Bri

      We received in our mailboxes this week a copy of the executive summary of a "Study on Women's Experiences at Harvard Law School" conducted by a committee of students.  It found that women receive slightly lower grades, volunteer to speak in class significantly less often, and are more likely to take public interest jobs and work on journals.  It was interesting.  I will now try to be funny for two paragraphs and then make a serious observation.  The study, unbelievably, ignores the biggest disparity of them all: from my observation, women are hundreds if not thousands of times more likely than men to use the womens bathrooms. Aside from that one time there was that guy who really couldnt hold it, and they were cleaning the mens room, and.  Honestly, I thought the real study was pretty interesting.  I went online and read the full report.  Most shocking finding: there is apparently a Committee on the Use of Human Subjects that has to approve student surveys.  That is a scary name for a committee.  Excuse me Im performing some medical testing on my fellow students, and was hoping no, Im not a licensed doctor oh, as long as I follow these easy-to-read instructions got it, thanks.  I was also surprised at the lengths necessary to find the gender of some of our classmates: For most students listed, we used their first names to determine gender. When the name was inconclusive, we looked at yearbook pictures. We used internet searches to identify the gender of the few remaining students.  Who are these gender-ambiguous students named Leslie and Pat who cant be identified by yearbook photo  and, more important, what did they find on the Internet that solved the problem?  Is there a secret gender-ambiguous identification website out there somewhere?  [Here's where I'm trying to be serious again]  The most compelling part of the full report, to me, were the selected student comments that were included:    One female 3L wrote, I've been surprised by the number of people that I see disengaged from life at HLS  both academic and extracurricular. There are lots of people who stop vocalizing what they are passionate about after their first year.   One male 3L wrote, The school manages to take 500 of the brightest and most motivated students in any field in the country and systematically pacify and alienate large proportions of them, so that by the time they are in their third year, many if not most students rarely attend class, do the reading, or care a fig about law.  I think its important to look at gender differences, and certainly if there are ways that women are being disadvantaged we should work to figure out why and address it.  But the quotes in the report, from men and from women, I think capture broader problems facing law students of both genders: a lot of people just dont seem to care that much.  And maybe there are ways to fix that.  If the report can get people thinking about that kind of stuff, I think it will have done an awesome service.  [Now I'm going to try and be funny again by parodying the survey]  Study on Lazy Peoples Experiences at Harvard Law School By the Non-Working Group on Student Experiences  Classroom Participation  We monitored student participation in three or four courses, but fell asleep before any statistics could be collected.  Of the results we did collect, we found that lazy students spoke on average 98% less often than motivated students, and were responsible for just 2% of comments in class.  Those comments included: could you repeat the question please? will this be on the exam? are we really going to get to tomorrows reading assignment, or can we just skip it? and some audible snoring.  Lazy students consistently volunteered less often than motivated students, and often remained in their seats for a substantial amount of time after class, failing to realize the class had ended.  Extracurricular Activities  Lazy people comprised just 1% of the executive boards of journals, and could not be found in any statistically significant numbers on Law Review, or ever having even considered it.  In fact, lazy people were more likely to travel to outer space than participate in the law review competition, for the years examined.  Student Life and Satisfaction  Lazy students and motivated students differed substantially in how they described their own abilities.  Lazy students gave themselves significantly lower scores in skills like waking up early, doing the reading, eating three meals a day, and going to the bathroom regularly.  However, they gave themselves significantly higher scores in watching television, surfing the Internet, wandering around aimlessly, and, with a tremendous disparity, sleeping.  Employment and Clerkships  While there was little difference in the percent of lazy students versus motivated students who accepted a job offer at a large law firm, a substantially higher percentage of lazy students never bothered to show up for work.  In addition, 42% of lazy students missed important deadlines like confirming their offers, choosing preferred practice areas, and filing their taxes.  Once at work, lazy people were much more likely to cry at random points during the day, and wish they had gone to art school instead.  In terms of the three most important factors in choosing a career, lazy students chose not having to do all that much work almost 14 times more often than did motivated students.  Academic Performance  We investigated grade patterns, and found that on average lazy students and motivated students received exactly the same law school grades.

      My grandma got her first cell phone last weekend.  The fact that she can carry it around with her and make calls from anywhere doesn't amaze her.  No, what amazes her is that she can set up the phone so that when she presses one button, it calls a whole number.  "But Grandma, you can do that with your regular phone too."  "What?  Really?"  Grandparents.  Aren't they cute?

       urlLink The Score Bard  just put up his 2004 Fantasy Baseball Draft simulator, which is a terrific way to waste 15 minutes trying to alleviate the baseball withdrawal that's been building since the World Series ended.  In my mock draft last night when I should have been sleeping, I probably grabbed Ryan Klesko and Junior Spivey a couple rounds too early, and missed out on 2004's NL MVP Mike Cameron, but other than that I think I did ok.  :)  Incidentally, if anyone's got a fantasy league with an opening, let me know.  I'm already in a couple, but I'm kind of obsessed, so I'd love to maybe add a couple more...

      Sherry at Stay of Execution has  urlLink a phenomenal post  (and I don't think I throw the word "phenomenal" around all that freely) about what makes a good law professor.  I agree with most of what she has to say, and she says it very well.  Despite the fact that I don't think I can do a better job than she's done, here's my take on it (and apologies that I'm stealing the title of her post):   What I Want In A Law Professor   You are brilliant, even though you may or may not care if we realize it.  I'm impressed if you wrote the casebook, but even if you didn't, you've read the casebook.  You may have taught this course three dozen times already, but you still care about the subject, and it still feels fresh to you.  You haven't memorized your lectures.  Calling on people isn't a way to give yourself a break from talking, or thinking.  You actually listen to what the students say and try to answer our questions.  Even better, you use the very best questions to springboard into different areas you may not have even planned on talking about, but somehow they've become relevant.  You never say, "this discussion has gotten really fascinating, but I'm going to stop it right in the middle and move on to something extremely boring."  In fact, you never even think that.  You have no patience for students who make the classroom anything other than a collegial atmosphere, and you don't hesitate to do what you can to eliminate any distractions they're causing.  You acknowledge when material is confusing.  You admit when you've made a mistake, or misspoken.  You double-check any math you do on the blackboard, but don't fight it when twelve students tell you you've added wrong.  You don't tell us we can learn the subject better from a commercial study guide, even if you think it might be true.  You tell us just enough about who you are and what you've done that we're in awe and want to know more, but not so much that we feel like we're watching an episode of A&E Biography.  You have very little patience for students who aren't trying.  You have more patience for students who actually are.  Even if you don't remember our names, you remember what we've said, the questions we've asked, and make us feel like you know more about us than perhaps you really do, because, to you, getting through to each student really is important.  You read the newspaper and bring up relevant issues in the news.  Sometimes you bring up irrelevant issues in the news, just because you think they're interesting, and, because you're brilliant, you have something interesting to say about them.  You attempt to be funny, whether or not you succeed.  It's the effort that counts.  You don't assign reading that you don't care if we read.  You don't assign reading that you're sure you won't get to.  You ask hard questions, but you throw us enough rope that we can find our way back if we get lost on the way to an answer.  You smile.  Your exam is hard, but fair.  You take the grading process seriously.  You aren't afraid to e-mail us about things you think we might be interested in.  You want students to come to you, but you realize that sometimes we're intimidated, and so you try to make it easier, and genuinely encourage interaction.  You answer e-mails.  You don't complain in class about having to have office hours.  You love your job.  You have a good heart.  You care.

      Oh!  It's rare to have any sort of epiphany when reading something on a weblog, but, here, from Evan Schaeffer's  urlLink Notes from the (Legal) Underground :   Back in the office, I did something I rarely do, which was to ask for more time from opposing counsel to file a brief I should have filed yesterday. These requests for extensions are always granted--and I'm always willing to grant them for others--but I hate to ask for more time because I'm afraid it will develop into a habit. You mean there are extensions??  We spend all that time in Civ Pro learning about 20 days for this, and 10 days for that, and sanctions, and oh no!  And it turns out not only  can  you ask for an extension, but people do all the time, and they're granted, and it's just not that big of a deal?  Oh!

      A reader just let me know that Dana Carvey, appearing on Leno tonight, told a joke that was substantively the same as my  urlLink Howard Dean joke  from Wednesday about what it would be like to be his patient if he goes back to practicing medicine ("...and then I'm gonna stick this tube all the way into your colon!  Yeaaaaaaaaagh!").  I'm kinda psyched about it.  If I'm coming up with the same joke as Dana Carvey, that's not bad company to be in.  I remember his sketch comedy show from about 7 or 8 years ago -- only lasted a handful of episodes, but I thought it was hilarious.  Wish it was on DVD.  Can't find it.  Maybe on e-bay.  Also, thanks to  urlLink Howard Bashman  for the link to my post below about the 40 leadership positions on the Harvard Law Review.  AND: For anyone who can't get enough, I'm guest-blogging over at  urlLink Crescat Sententia  this week, honored simply to have been asked.  It's a cool blog.  I just (literally, just a minute ago) posted my first piece over there, which mentions Pasta, Saddam Hussein, and Abortion, all in the space of three paragraphs.  I think I've just guaranteed a hit from the next person who googles "Abortion Pasta."  You know, for the big italian buffet that always accompanies the occasion.  I wouldn't write that if it wasn't coming up on 2 A.M.  I think it's time for bed.

      Here's an  urlLink unexpectedly cool article  from the NY Times about the TiVo remote control and some of the thoughts that go into designing a remote control.  And the sidebar has a pretty interesting (although disappointingly brief) slide show of other remote controls and their poorly-designed features (side-by-side volume control instead of up-and-down, etc).  It actually makes me think that if there isn't one already, a web page featuring the most poorly engineered remote controls -- or, even broader, the most poorly engineered consumer products -- would be pretty cool.  There's gotta be something like that out there already... right?  Update: A very quick google search helped me find a really comprehensive remote control review site, but all the reviews seem to be too positive for me to get any humor value out of it.  And also, in what might possibly be the worst idea ever, the  urlLink Weemote , a remote control for children.  Look, if your child can't figure out how to use the remote control, maybe that's a sign you should turn off the TV and make him read a book.  Terrible idea.

      Letterman last night said that Howard Dean said he'll go back to being a doctor should he lose his bid for the nomination.  Letterman asked whether anyone would really want to be his first patient.  But so much further the joke could have gone.  I really wouldn't want to be Howard Dean's patient: "First I'm going to look in your nose; then I'm gonna look in your ears; then I'm gonna look down your throat; and then I'm gonna **stick this tube all the way into your colon**.  Yeaaaaaaaagh!"  Or at least that's how I would have written the joke.

      Today at noon, I get to try out the new online grade reporting system to find out my grade in my winter term class.  When 1L grades came out, a 1L I know happened to e-mail me at about 11:45 saying he'd gotten his grades.  So I know that when they say noon they don't mean exactly noon.  So how many times do you think I've checked so far this morning?  :)  I know I shouldn't really care, but I'm curious, and I kind of want to know.  And it's not there yet.  But soon.  Perhaps.  Stopping my morning productivity.  Of course, my morning productivity is usually stopped by something anyway.  At least today I have an actual reason. Not a good reason.  But at least it's something. (UPDATE: Got the grade at 11:52.  Anticlimactic, of course.  Looks pretty much like all the others.  Like everyone's do.)  Also -- just curious and looking for input -- if any of you were En Banc readers, or read any group weblogs, and there are things you specifically liked / didn't like / would like / ideas / etc -- e-mail me and let me know your thoughts.  Trying to figure out next steps, and seems reasonable to see if anyone has any interesting thoughts or ideas.

      Latest in a series: more free stuff from the Dean.  She's expanded wireless access.  I think I may be the only student here without a wireless card.  But anyway.  She included this message in her e-mail -- which, since I don't have a wireless card doesn't affect me anyway, but:   Second and equally important, students should not use the wireless  network during class unless a professor specifically has authorized such use.  Violation of this rule is harmful to the learning process and disrespectful to both faculty and fellow students.  Except when the professor determines that access to the network will enhance the  educational experience, the classroom is not an appropriate place to make use of network service.  Given the law school's paramount goal of providing the finest possible education to all its students, I cannot stress enough the importance of this restriction. I want to know in what class access to the network will enhance the learning experience.  "Class, I'm about to ramble on for a while, so this may be a good time to check sports scores or instant message your friend at Yale."  Eh.  If it cuts down on the amount of ESPN in my peripheral vision, I'll be somewhat pleased.

      From  urlLink The Daily Princetonian's  interview with 20/20 co-anchor John Stossel (Princeton '69)   P: Do you have any advice for Princeton students?  S: Every lawyer I think sucks about $60,000 to $80,000 a year out of the economy so I would encourage people to go into science, medicine or business, but not law. We have too many lawyers already . . . Law is forced, and government is forced. We should keep the forced sector small and the free sector big.  Everyone loves lawyers.

       urlLink JD2B  also links to a post by  urlLink Jim Dedman  that links to another post (all this linking!) about the six types of law students: "The Disgusting Elite... The Star Students... The Single Focus Student... The Survivors... The Graspers at Straws... The DOAs."  Uh, maybe -- but that's not a very interesting breakdown.  That's just a set of labels for the GPA distribution, really.  And I'm not sure I understand what a "single focus student" is -- if you do well in one or two classes and not the rest, I'm skeptical that has much to do at all with your aptitude in that type of law -- I'd bet it has more to do with the professor or the type of exam or factors like that.  In any event, I can't believe that we can't get a better list than that of the law student types.    Like the Myers-Briggs Personality tests, I think the best way to sort law students might be on a bunch of different continuums (continuua?).  Your "Law Student Typology" would then be the combination of your leanings on the various attribute scales, and would say something about you overall.  I think I've come up with something relatively interesting, at least to open a debate about this stuff.  I don't know how successful I've been, or how accurate this is.  But I thought I'd try.  Here goes:   The Law School Typology Scale   Intensity Scale -- I / C -- Intense / Chill.  Students at the "I" end of the spectrum sit in the front row and raise their hand a lot.  They distribute application forms for the study groups they want to start.  They write hundred-page outlines.  They don't sleep.  If they didn't think they would get caught, they would rip pages out of library books and bring unauthorized material into the exam.  They have lots of Lexis points.  They eat Powerbars.  They try out for law review.  They really want to work at Skadden.  They don't expect to live to see 70.  And no one else expects them to either.  Students at the "C" end of the spectrum may or may not care about their results as much as their intense counterparts, but the difference is that if they notice you've fallen into a well, they'll probably try and help you out.  They'd rather not talk in class, or at least only if they really do have a legitimate question.  They don't kill themselves.  They sleep.  They may or may not join study groups.  Theirs don't meet every day.  Interest Scale -- T / B -- Trying / Blowing It Off.  This is a different measure than the intensity scale, although it might be rare to find someone who's an "I" and also a "B" -- but the other three combinations all seem relatively common.  Students on the "T" end, whether they show it or not, really care how they do.  Students on the "B" end really don't.  They don't go to class, they don't read, they don't remember to bring a pen to the exam...  Involvement Scale -- O / U -- Overcommitted / Undercommitted.  Overcommitted students are in everything -- legal, non-legal, fun, not fun, interesting, uninteresting.  Undercommitted students watch TV and sometimes play Playstation, if they feel like it.  Into the law -- L / N -- Love it / Not gonna do it.  This one's easy.  There are the ones who want to be on the Supreme Court, and the ones who don't.  So -- these four attributes get us the 12 law student types (I've eliminated the 4 I/B combinations, because I don't know if you can be intense and checked-out at the same time).  As I sort this out, I'm starting to think my scales may not be exactly the right ones.  But I'll let this be a jumping off point for some other blogger to fix my errors.  ITOL -- Future Wachtell associates ITON -- Future Wachtell associates who are only there for the money, I guess. ITUL -- Really boring future Wachtell associates? ITUN --  CTOL -- Future happy lawyers? CTON -- Future happy non-lawyers? CTUL --  CTUN -- CBOL -- CBON -- These are the people who are having all the fun, I guess CBUL -- CBUN -- These are the people playing Playstation all day

       urlLink JD2B  links to a  urlLink law review article  about what law schools and legal education can learn from the Oakland A's baseball team and its general manager, Billy Beane, following Michael Lewis's 2003 book, "Moneyball," about how Beane has in a lot of ways revolutionized the baseball front office.  I read Moneyball last year, not long after it came out, and enjoyed it, although I thought it was too short, and would have loved it to go even more in-depth.  But overall it was good.  And obviously stuff about law school interests me.  So I was excited to read this -- perhaps the first law review article I was ever excited to read.  My thoughts below.   The authors' main point in the article is that just as how Billy Beane brought rigorous numerical analysis to baseball, legal education would be better served by bringing rigor to law school rankings, like the ones U.S. News has created a very profitable cottage industry around (side note: imagine being the guy who told U.S. News they should start ranking stuff?  gotta be one of the top 100 best business decisions of the last twenty years, I would think.  is U.S. News identified with anything as much as their identified with their rankings?  Time has the Man of the Year, U.S. News has its rankings, and Newsweek... uh... prints stories and stuff...).  The first chunk of the article basically summarizes Moneyball, and sets out the idea that before what one might call a statistical revolution in baseball, started by sabermetrician Bill James, baseball executives were using bad information to make decisions, and even good management couldn't overcome that.  Post-James, and pre-Billy Beane, teams had that good statistical information, but general managers refused to use it -- hence the problem had switched to good information and bad management.  Beane exploited this inefficiency and began using good information combined with good management -- which led to unorthodox picks in the amateur baseball draft based not so much on how good a player "looked" but what his statistics had been.  The next chunk compares law school to baseball, finding them similar in their competitiveness and the existence of "winners" and "losers" in the rankings and in faculty recruitment.  But while in baseball, there are wins and losses to measure quality, in legal education, we had nothing -- until the U.S. News rankings.  The authors make an interesting point that regardless of how accurate or inaccurate the rankings are, whether they measure something or nothing at all, the mere existence of rankings is useful because it allows students to sort themselves, and gives law firms and other legal employers the ability to make judgments based on how those students have sorted -- since more students, and more qualified students, will apply to schools at the top of the rankings -- to send a signal to law firms -- those schools will have to become more and more selective because of space reasons -- and thus they will be validating those signals... thus the rankings themselves lead to effective sorting regardless of the merits of the rank.  I've just done a terrible job of explaining that clearly.  Read the article for better than that. The article makes another interesting side point that among the "alternative ranking systems" that have been proposed, the schools where the rank-inventing professors teach all finish higher under their alternative systems than under the US News system.  Nice.    The article then goes into a fairly long discussion about how to measure faculty quality that I found myself skimming, mostly because it wasn't about baseball.  :)  One thing they find is that publishing in a law review as a student, or publishing a bunch of articles (more than one) before getting the first tenure-track job are both solid indications of more publishing to come, in good journals -- but that "pedigree" variables don't really matter much (rank of law school, whether on law review, clerkship, advanced degree).  One problem with the article's underpinnings, as I see it -- and I realize this is entirely a baseball argument and has nothing to do with legal education -- is that it trusts Moneyball too much.  Yes, all evidence points to Beane being an excellent general manager.  I wouldn't dispute the argument that he's the best in baseball.  But his unorthodox picks in the amateur draft haven't all panned out, and many of them are in fact underperforming.  Much of the A's success has been based around their three young pitchers -- Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, and Mark Mulder -- who have all stayed healthy and developed into top-of-the-rotation starters.  Beane surely deserves credit for their development -- but most teams with three top starters, regardless of what statistics the general manager is using -- will find success.  See the 2003 Chicago Cubs, for example -- and no one's accusing them of leading the sabermetric revolution.  Many of the players Beane has sought -- Erubiel Durazo and Scott Hatteberg, just to pick two -- have performed solidly but below expectations.  The statistics tell us something, but I'm not sure Beane has yet to find the Holy Grail.  He may, but I don't know that we're there yet.  So, on that level, to me the analogy holds a little less power.  Eh.  The article was kind of interesting, but the analogy only went so far -- Beane brought statistics in to make his team better; how can we bring statistics in to hire better faculty at law schools.  It's okay, but it's not the world's most exciting argument.    An interesting read if the quality of law school faculty interests you, or you want a quick summary of Moneyball.  If you're a baseball fan who doesn't care that much about law review publication rates -- and I suppose that probably means you're not looking to read any law review articles anyway -- you can just as easily pass.

      I haven't taken a course in Evidence, and I'm not sure I remember much Criminal Procedure from 1L fall, so this song parody probably contains gross misstatements of the law.  But why should that stop me.   "Admissible" (To the tune of Clay Aiken's "Invisible")   Saw, that gun in your room But I do not have, a warrant to search Drugs, are under your bed A knife in your hand One more in jail, and I get a raise So what if there's no crime I know of that you did  [Chorus]  If it was admissible The jury would send you straight to jail If it's insuppressible The trial would be quick Miranda inaudible Then I could just frame you for the crime The promotion would be mine If I was incompetent (Wait...I already am)  Saw, you killing a bug But was it a bug? Or was it a man? I keep looking at you You're washing your hands Wish that was blood, and not jelly you were washing off Wish I could find a corpse and blame you for the crime  [Chorus]  If it was admissible The jury would send you straight to jail If it's insuppressible The trial would be quick Miranda inaudible Then I could just frame you for the crime The promotion would be mine If I was incompetent (Wait...I already am)  You reach out Reaching for the poison? No, it's just the Pringles And another soda  We have no crime tied to you But I can't let that be true...  [Repeat Chorus]

      Readers of  urlLink En Banc  may be alarmed to see the "End of En Banc" message on the homepage.  I was too.  But don't despair.  (And there's no hard feelings on my end.  It's just a weblog.  Things happen.)  Hopefully, if you were a loyal reader, it helped you discover some talented writers and interesting bloggers.  All but one of whom have solo blogs that, if you enjoyed their material on En Banc, there's no reason not to check out --  urlLink Unlearned Hand ,  urlLink Chris ,  urlLink Greg , and  urlLink PG .  In any event, it looks as if some fraction of us may try and continue the group blog thing.  Obviously, I'll let you know when something's definite.  Of course, nothing impacts anything here.  Not even nuclear war could keep me from writing moderately funny song parodies.  Actually, nuclear war probably could.  But anything short of that.

       Week In Review: Concluding Thoughts on Harvard's Porn Magazine   This week, there was a bit of controversy as The Crimson announced, just in time for Valentine's Day, that Harvard had approved an undergraduate sex magazine.  We get an ice rink, they get naked pictures of each other.  Harvard quickly backtracked after the mainstream media firestorm made them realize maybe this wasn't a good idea.  "Where does your daughter go to school?"  "Harvard."  "Oh, I knew that.  From this magazine I saw."  Professors' seating charts would be so much more interesting.  I know, I know.  There simply aren't enough opportunities out there for Harvard students who want to appear naked in the pages of a magazine, on video, or on the Internet, and it really is the school's duty to make sure there's a forum on campus for students who want to foreclose all opportunities to run for political office in the future, or to look their grandparents in the eye ever again.  "Honey, you've always been good at writing.  Why don't you join a campus magazine."  "Well, okay.  How about---?"  "NO!  NOT THAT ONE!"  "But I would just be joining it for the articles."  Actually, I shouldn't have said the magazine was announced just in time for Valentine's Day.  It was actually just in time for Presidents Day, in honor of President Clinton.  Or maybe in honor of John Kerry, if the Internet rumors are true and he did in fact receive botox injections from an intern.  I may be getting two rumors confused.  The magazine may also have been in honor of Dennis Kucinich, who continues his search for love on the campaign trail with an appearance on Blind Date next week.  The Law School is saving its announcement about a similarly-themed new magazine for Halloween.  Or maybe Lent.  Ten points if that makes sense to you, because I'm not even sure it makes sense to me.  A Law School magazine like that would be kind of cool.  Instead of scanning for the highest grades, law firms could scan for, uh, other things.  Perhaps some students could get pro bono credit for posing, and others could get arrested.  It could be run by the Legal Aid Bureau; it's just a different kind of Aid than they're used to.  Yeah.  I think I've pretty much run out of steam on this topic.

      In case your Valentine's Day is  not quite as sweet  as for the Civil Procedure couple below, here's a Property Love (or Love-Gone-Bad) Song to enjoy instead.  Sort of.  Property is a bundle of rights And I want to hold you in my bundle tonight I want a right to exclude Anybody else from seeing you in the nude  If I have to I'll adversely possess The shirt that you're wearing and your lovely new dress I want to use you exclusively I own you and you rent me   You're my property For all of perpetuity I'm putting a Restrictive Covenant On anybody else touching you  You're my property I'll sell you into slavery I own an Easement On every part of you   Your new boyfriend knew when he came to town That I had a covenant and I wrote it down Implied, reciprocal, and negatively I have a servitude so you belong to me  He says it's an unreasonable restraint But I am his lawyer and won't file that complaint He claims that you've been alienated But he does not have privity from when it was created   You're my property For all of perpetuity I'm putting a Restrictive Covenant On anybody else touching you  You're my property I'll sell you into slavery I own an Easement On every part of you   I have a simple fee Unless I sell you, you belong to me   You're my property For all of perpetuity I'm putting a Restrictive Covenant On anybody else touching you  You're my property I'll sell you into slavery I own an Easement On every part of you

      In honor of Valentine's Day, I thought I'd re-post this Civil Procedure Love Song I wrote last year.  Enjoy.  "You Have Jurisdiction over Me"  (The guy sings)  In civil procedure, I sit next to you And stare at you from your head to your International Shoe You made my heart skip a beat when your Long Arm touched my casebook I stared at your picture for three hours in my facebook  And though you're from a different land I hope you'll give me your hand So I can serve you process I want to purposely avail Of what makes you that one female No matter what the law says  This is procedure, not contracts And we have minimum contacts So despite our diversity In your court is where I want to be You have jurisdiction over me  (The girl sings)  In civil procedure you sit next to me And yours is the only laptop I ever need to see Watching you play solitaire has shown me what real lust is If we're not together it won't be substantial justice  You are the one guy in this school Who'd make me break a fed'ral rule Don't 12-b-6 dismiss me You look at me and my heart skips The venue's here on my two lips You see, I'm asking you to kiss me  This is procedure, not contracts And we have minimum contacts So despite our diversity In your court is where I want to be You have jurisdiction over me  (They sing together)   We've satisfied International Shoe And my Erie choice of law is you And though the federal question's unclear It's worth more than seventy-five thousand dollars To have you here  This is procedure, not contracts And we have minimum contacts So despite our diversity In your court is where I want to be You have jurisdiction over me

       Valentine's Day Gifts, If Your Beloved Happens to be a Law Student   1. The Vermont Teddy Bear Company's "Socratic Bear," who comes with an apple for the teacher, and a permanently raised right hand; wears a suit for no reason; carries a casebook; and has a voice chip that randomly says the names of cases.  The point being that the bear has read the casebook, cover to cover.  2. Tortious Chocolates, from the Russell Stover Deep Pockets Candy Company, each filled with something else you can sue them over -- razor blades, human organs, unlabeled peanuts for the nut-allergic, pork, fingernail clippings, hair, the date rape drug, the morning after pill... you get the point.  3. A diploma from the University of Phoenix Online law school, just $495 for regular, $595 for honors.  4. Tax flash cards, Valentine's Edition, which come in red and pink with pretty pictures of flowers surrounding the tables and formulas.  The Engagement Edition comes with a set of cards that explains how your tax liability will go down if you were married and could file jointly, an romantic enticement to marriage no one could ever refuse.  5. A new Bluebook, for those long nights checking citations.  How romantic!  6. Red roses, from the flower shop that lost its revolving line of credit and needed to quickly dump its inventory out of spite so the bank wouldn't get anything when it showed up with the special flower-storage trucks it was going to use to transport the flowers out and over to a flower store that didn't default on its loan.  Probably should have taken some more precautions to protect your collateral before effectively shutting down the business, right, Bank?  (Can you tell I took Secured Transactions?)  7. Toy handcuffs, to commemorate the experience of taking Criminal Law.  Or for some other reason.  ??  8. A graphic love poem that borders on sexual harassment or some other tort.  Because getting served with a lawsuit on Valentine's Day from your beloved would be so much fun...

      This morning I woke up in the middle of an unusually vivid dream where I was being escorted around New York by three representatives from a law firm, one of which was the Josh Lyman character on the West Wing, another was a partner at the firm, and the third was some guy I think was a co-worker of mine in a summer job I had a few years ago.  Anyway, I kept asking "lifestyle" questions -- "do people have any other interests besides work?"  "what if I had an appointment on a Saturday and wanted to keep it?"  "is it important that I bring a pillow to the office for the nights I may have to sleep there?" -- and the partner kept giving me answers about how you come and work for the firm and the firm is your life, and the West Wing guy kept saying that it was mostly true but that the partner told him to embellish a little bit, because it's just all part of the game, and we walked across a highway overpass and then down a very narrow spiral staircase to a diner, where they introduced me to "the granddaughter of the commissioner of baseball," who was apparently, in the world of my dream, very famous and the subject of much media attention.  But we could only say hello and grab a quick waffle (yes, a waffle -- maybe that means something!) because we had to get back to the office for the meeting about the asbestos.  I don't know what else the meeting was about.

      An article in the Harvard Crimson yesterday was titled: "Committee Approves Porn Magazine: H Bomb will feature nude pictures of undergraduates" and got a bunch of press, and, as far as I can tell, has been pulled from their online archives this morning.  I posted something about it on  urlLink En Banc  yesterday, quoting a small part of the article:  "The Committee on College Life (CCL) voted to approve a student-run magazine that will feature nude pictures of Harvard undergraduates... as an official Harvard publication.... In order to avoid liability, students will not be able to take nude pictures inside of Harvard buildings."  And saying that while my initial reaction was that this must be a joke, it appears not to be. I understand the whole free speech thing, and I'm not saying this should be illegal. But can anyone possibly make the argument that this is a good idea?   Anyway, I'm just recycling my En Banc post over here because I thought it was an interesting story, and I have nothing else coming to mind to write about this morning.  I'm trying.  Later on today (when it gets online), I'll link to my law school newspaper article about online grades -- it looks a bunch like what I wrote on here over the weekend, except since when the grades actually came out for 1Ls on Tuesday, the system worked, the school did not blow up, and so my column, all about how it'll never actually work, was rendered utterly and completely irrelevant -- but I tried my best to salvage it.  You'll see when I link to it.  Not sure if I made it work, or I just made it seem like I wrote the article too soon.  Oh well.

      One of my professors has been using pop-culture characters in his examples to teach us how the laws of agency work, like Bruce Wayne, and some Lord of the Rings hobbits, and Michael Eisner of Disney.  I came up with one too.    Anyone who's taken corporations is welcome to play along and try to solve this one.  --> Janet Jackson hires out-of-work songstress (and seamstress) Sporty Spice to sew a costume for her performance at the Super Bowl.  Sporty comes over to Jackson's house and takes her measurements; Janet gives Sporty the keys to her truck and tells her that she can do the sewing at Janet's private hideaway just down the road.  On the way to the private hideaway, Sporty gets hungry and takes a detour to a sandwich shop.  Since she's used to driving on the other side of the road, on the way to the sandwich shop, Sporty runs over James Brown.  Oops.  After Sporty gets the sandwich, she goes to the hideaway and sews a lovely dress for Janet.  She drives back -- running over Glen Campbell on the way -- and shows Janet the dress, which has a super-special pouch that tears off, revealing one of her, uh, Golden Globes.  Janet says that it looks great.  She drives over to CBS headquarters -- running over Rick Springfield on the way -- and shows her costume to network president Les Moonves, who tells her she can employ anyone she wants to rip her costume off during the show, except for that rogue Justin Timberlake.  He writes her a letter, on CBS stationary, that says she has permission to hire someone.  Janet, who suffers from hearing loss due to a mysterious childhood accident involving her brother, a policeman's nightstick, and a turtle, thought Mr. Moonves told her not to wear Timberland boots.  So she went over to Justin Timberlake's house, which was filled with soap suds due to a prank by Justin's friend Ashton Kutcher for his MTV show Punk'd, showed him the letter, and asked him to help her at the Super Bowl.  The next day, they performed at the Super Bowl, he pulled off her costume, and Michael Jackson, who had never before seen that part of a woman's anatomy, was emotionally distressed and sued.  So did all the people who got hit by Janet's truck.  Who's liable?

      As a service to the 1Ls here who got grades today and are aching to find out how other people did but don't want to ask, for fear they'll either (1) feel bad, (2) make someone else feel bad, or (3) be known as that guy (or girl) who keeps asking people about their grades -- if you send me a blank e-mail, I will send you back an e-mail with the subject line "someone else's grades" and make up three reasonably low marks that would probably make you feel better about whatever you got.  :)

      1Ls here get their grades tomorrow at noon, on the new Internet Grade Retrieval System (TM).  To any HLS 1Ls who read this (and I know there's at least three of you, maybe more!), good luck.  Five thoughts for 1Ls upon receiving their first law school grades:  1. Someone probably did worse.  If not in all three classes, probably at least in one.  And if not, then you have dozens of new friends, because you've prevented them from being that guy.  But in most cases, really, as bad as you did, someone did worse.  Someone who did well enough in college, and on their LSAT, and whose parents gave enough money to the school -- someone did worse.  So don't worry about it.  2. Yes, maybe you're used to getting all A's and here you didn't.  But you've gotten enough grades and taken enough tests and succeeded enough to know you can do this stuff.  It's just some tests, it's not your whole self-worth.  You post-grades is the same as you pre-grades, just as obnoxiously arrogant and impressed with yourself.  Don't let a couple of bad grades change your whole perfect image of how brilliant you are.  3. Lots of people think these grades aren't measuring anything much, and professors can't possibly distinguish between an A-minus and a B-plus, and maybe they're right.  At best, your grade is measuring how well you answered the specific questions your professor asked, and they could have asked other questions that you might have done better on, or on a different day you may have included three more of the key words on your professor's checklist, and gotten a higher grade.  In any event, maybe you wrote a crappy answer.  Maybe you didn't know the answer to the question the professor asked.  Doesn't mean you didn't learn the subject, doesn't mean you're not smart, and, good heavens, it doesn't mean your parents won't love you anymore.  4. I know two people's grades.  Two people know mine.  Not counting family.  And any potential employer who bothered to look -- and I don't think they all did.  But still, the number of people who are going to know these things is pretty small.  Unless you have a weblog and do something stupid like post your grades and proceed to get pelted with raw eggs by your classmates, no one will ever know.  Heck, lie to your friends.  Who'll ever find out?  They're just a couple of letters.  WIth mathematical symbols next to some of them.  Does any of this really matter?  5. You're still as employable as you were before, basically.  Certainly here, everyone gets a job.  And at fourth-tier law schools like Stanford, no one gets a job anyway, no matter what grades you have, so you haven't hurt yourself with the 3 C's anyway.  Yeah, maybe you won't get the Supreme Court clerkship.  But come on, you weren't going to get that anyway, and a couple of years from now when the Supreme Court screws up another election no one'll want to be around those justices anyway.  Once more, good luck!

      This afternoon, I went to my first session of a class that I picked up after one of my classes turned out to not be exactly what I was looking for.  And was really impressed.  Not necessarily because the professor used this cool outline mapping program that made it really easy to tell where we were, what we were talking about, and how it fit into the larger picture, although that was fine.  More because he was actually alive and engaged, and engaged the class, and I felt more interested than I usually do sitting in class.  There are other professors here who are also good, and a handful that are quite excellent, and I've had a few of them.  But there are enough that are just OK that I forget sometimes how much of a difference it makes, and how much more enjoyable -- instead of just tolerable -- class can be with the right professor.  I know I'm cynical sometimes about all this law school stuff.  But good class today.  I'm pleasantly surprised, and impressed, and happy with my choice.  And the casebook's not bad either.

      To the reader who found me via the Google search: "accidentally swallow mouthwash" -- you've come to the right place.  In less than a year and a half, I'll have my law degree, and be happy to represent you -- and a class of similarly situated accidental mouthwash swallowers -- in your case against the makers of Listerine, Scope, Plax, and the rest of those  evil germ-killers  for torts committed by making their mouthwash too easy to swallow, too full of minty fresh flavor, and too vague as far as the potential damage from ingestion.  Even if swallowing the mouthwash will do no harm -- and there is no evidence of that! -- the failure to include an anti-warning on the label, like "swallowing this mouthwash will not kill you," for example, in big bold glow-in-the-dark letters, caused you to experience severe mental anguish and emotional distress, made you miss work, and in fact led you to murder the clerk at CVS.  I can, for a 33% contingency, clear you of the murder charge, and help you -- and a class of similarly situated claimants -- collect millions of dollars from these evil corporations.  I'm here to help.  Send me an e-mail and we'll talk.

      More about our new on-line grades system.  I have a theory.  We're being hoodwinked.  Tricked.  Manipulated.  I read the Dean's e-mail again.  "the Registrar's office has devised a system to allow students to obtain their grades on-line."  See anything about a computer?  I don't.  The Internet?  No mention.  Here's the real truth, as far as I can tell: when grades come out, I'm going to be waiting on one big long line outside the Registrar's office.  That's what on-line means to these people.  On a line.  A long, slow line.*  Manned by proctors.  After all, it's months until the next exam period and these people have to feed their families and pay for their blood pressure medication.  They can't afford to have us getting our grades through the network - the same network that has spent the past two weeks unable to keep out an e-mail virus.  At least if we do get grades on-line, here at Harvard can rest assured that the system security will match the security of the add-drop process. I walked into the secret add-drop location (signs up all over the building) on Friday to drop my Oral Tradition in the Law Reading Group (too many books), filled out the form, handed it to the great-grandfatherly proctor sitting at the table, reading a book called "Prostate Health and You," and he glanced at it and put it in a box.  "Do you need to see my ID?"  "No."  "Do I have to sign anything?"  "No."  "So I could just come in here and drop someone else's classes for them without anyone ever finding out until it's too late?"  "I'm sorry, it's time for my nap."  "Okay."  And then I left.  And put on a fake mustache, returned, and secretly dropped all of my least-favorite law school acquaintances out of all of their classes so they never get their diplomas, but it won't matter because they already have jobs and no one will ever check.  The havoc I have wrought!  The power!  The power that will be gone if we ever move to on-line course selection!  Which of course we won't, since fifteen minutes after our grades are made available on-line, the system is going to crash, all of the grades will be lost, the registrar's office will realize they have already shredded the hard copies, and everyone here will have to take our exams over again.  All because of on-line grades.  See what they have done, these greedy students who demanded an on-line grading system?  Are they happy with themselves?  Oh, the humanity!  Also, the e-mail didn't say when we're getting these mysterious on-line grades.  Yes, 1Ls -- they can have your fall term grades... next fall.  And the 2Ls and 3Ls can log-on and get our winter-term grades in about seven and a half years, when all the other law schools will be delivering grades by text message to people's cell phones, or just beaming them into people's brains through infrared fiber optic gamma waves (can you tell I just added "Communications Law" to my schedule?), and we'll be laughed at as that poor school that just started delivering grades on that Internet thing that's so old-school.  But we'll still have an ice rink.  Except that everyone else will be ice skating on Mars, which, thanks to the efforts of President Jeb Bush, we will have colonized for the sole purpose of ice skating and trash disposal.  Other law schools will be magically transporting their students to Mars using cellular reformation technology, just to go ice skating, and we'll still be using the ice rink next to our beautiful dorms, anchored to the ground when other law schools have housing that hovers in the air, defying gravity but including free cable television and toasters built right into the walls.  For toast.  I don't know why.  But what else can they really build into the walls?  They'll be laughing at us.  Us and our non-genetically-enhanced brains with our non-genetically-enhanced food in the cafeteria will fall to 137th in the U.S. News rankings because of the low genetic enhancement score, the paltry ice rink ranking, and the pathetic infrared gamma wave grade-beaming point total.  Even Thomas Cooley Law School and its virtual reality library catalog will be putting us to shame.  But we have on-line grades.  Or at least the promise of them.  It's a step in the right direction.  Perhaps one day we'll have online registration too.  Nah, that'll never happen.  *absurdly astute readers will recall a mention last week that I bought the DVD set of the Ben Stiller Show.  These same astute readers, who have listened to the commentary tracks, will realize that I have "borrowed" this on-line/on line joke from Mr. Stiller, who, on the commentary to the DVD, talks about meeting one of the writers on line in 1990 -- when on line meant on a line, since there was no Internet.  Just giving credit where credit is due.  In a footnote.

      Some courses in the course catalog this spring that might be interesting, but just don't sound that interesting to me. No offense meant by this list -- some of these courses really may be great -- but I thought I'd try to give some aspiring law students nightmares tonight:  Capital Market Regulation--Readings: Seminar  This seminar will focus on capital market regulation. This includes, but is not limited to, regulation of trading practices, exchange regulation, the role of mandated disclosure, and issues surrounding the globalization of securities trading.  Civil Procedure Advanced: Class Actions and Other Contemporary Issues  This course will explore some advanced issues relating to personal jurisdiction, supplemental jurisdiction, class actions and other aspects of complex litigation, the injunction, and their role in civil litigation.  Corporate Governance: Advanced Issues: Seminar  This four-credit seminar will meet over the academic year. We will focus on current academic thinking on corporate governance and the bases for differences around the world. The first semester will not have a research component; the second semester will.  Financial Derivatives  This course examines the economics and regulation of financial derivatives. We will cover the various types of derivative instruments and their primary trading markets, the regulation of financial derivatives, and the implications of financial innovation for individual and systemic risk, for corporate governance, and for social welfare.  Financial Institutions  This course explores the regulation of financial institutions in the United States. The course covers depository institutions, such as banks and thrifts, as well as other types of financial intermediaries, including insurance companies, securities firms, and investment companies.  International Finance  This course examines international banking and securities transactions and their regulation in the United States, the European Union, and Japan, as well as offshore and global financial markets, and emerging markets. It considers major areas of international regulation, e.g., the Basle Capital Accord and clearing and settlement. The course emphasizes understanding of important transactions, e.g., the use of Rule 144A securities in the United States and interest rate and currency swaps in the Euromarkets.  Pension Law  This course will explore retirement income policy by examining both Social Security and employer-based pension programs. As to Social Security, topics include benefit structure, state of financing and proposals for reform, including individual accounts. As to employer-based pensions, we will examine the special tax treatment as well as regulation under the Employee Retirement Security Act (ERISA) and other federal and state law, with respect to participation and vesting, funding and benefit guarantees and fiduciary responsibility of employers, their advisors and investment managers.  Securities Regulation B  This course offers an intensive introduction to the two most important federal securities laws: the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The course explores the elaborate disclosure obligations that this country imposes on the distribution and trading of investment securities. Topics to be covered include the preparation of disclosure documents, exemptions from disclosure requirements, the relationship between disclosure obligations and anti-fraud rules, the duties of participants in securities transactions, and the applicability of federal securities laws to transnational transactions.   Taxation: Corporate Transactions  This course covers the federal income tax issues involved in the organization, operation, and restructuring of U.S. business corporations, including acquisitions, mergers, and spinoffs. The course provides the tax background necessary to understand many common business transactions for both public and closely held companies.

      More gifts from the Dean:   To all students:  I'm very pleased to tell you that, in response to student demand, the Registrar's office has devised a system to allow students to obtain their grades on-line.  This system will go into effect in time for 1Ls to get their fall term-grades and 2Ls and 3Ls to get their winter-term grades in this way.

       Interview with the "B" I got in Evidence*    [*Ed. note: I did not actually take Evidence.  So the B is not a real grade.  Just to unnecessarily clear that up.]   [Ed. note #2: This came out less funny than I imagined it would.  My bad.]   INTERVIEWER: It's nice of you to take time to sit down with us this morning.  Thanks. B: Well, it's between grading periods, so I don't have that much to do.  Come May, I'll be quite busy. INTERVIEWER: I wanted to talk to you about how you ended up on the transcript, as the evidence grade. B: I was bubbled in. INTERVIEWER: Yes, I understand -- but take me back further than that.  How did you get chosen for the task, as opposed to one of your colleagues elsewhere in the alphabet? B: Well, the professor and I go way back -- I'm one of her favorite grades, and she often calls on me when, well, nothing else really makes sense. INTERVIEWER: What do you mean? B: My good friend A, and I don't mean at all to disparage his fine work, but he has the easy job.  His papers stand out.  There's something different about them, something special.  Everything's spelled right, there are attractive bold subheads, the cases are properly used, there's a real understanding of the material demonstrated.  His slightly retarded brother, A-, also has a pretty easy task.  You know, maybe there's some faulty logic or some rough spots, but it's pretty good stuff he's dealing with. INTERVIEWER: And then there's you? B: Well, yeah.  I mean, for stuff that's truly bad -- truly, obviously bad -- I have colleagues who deal with that.  C, D, F, sometimes L.  But, I mean, those are the papers where it's not clear they've taken the same exam as everyone else, or sat through the same class.  But, yeah, then there's me.  For the morass of papers in the middle.  Who knows what happened -- they had a mental block, they just didn't know the material well enough, misread the question, shallow analysis, sloppy execution, ran out of time, etc, etc, etc.  So that's where I come in. INTERVIEWER: And you provide a valuable service, reminding students they can do better, but also that they could have done worse? B: No, not really.  But the pay is good.

      Thanks for the birthday wishes.  I was overwhelmed by the response, which just goes to show me that begging for e-mail works pretty well.  I'll try to keep future begging to a minimum, although I think anyone would agree that it's a lot better than if I stuck one of those PayPal donation boxes over in the corner and every so often pointed it out and mentioned that I'm a poor law school student who will only be earning $2400 a week this summer and I'd really love a new pair of socks since the old one is getting kind of dirty.  No, seriously, I read one or two weblogs that are pretty good but the people who write them do occasionally solicit donations, and I know maybe they're worth it, and maybe they really do need the money, but there's something really unseemly about it.  At least offer me a t-shirt or something.  But anyway, I was glad to get the birthday e-mails I got, and I won't be putting up a PayPal donation box anytime in the foreseeable future, although anyone who'd be excited to give money to the cause is encouraged instead to tell everyone you know that I'm funny and they should read my site.  Or don't.  It's fine either way.  I don't send mass e-mails to my friends telling them I read the New York Times on the web; I don't expect you to tell your friends you read my song parodies.  But if you did, it's not like I'd be angry.  :)

      With apologies to  urlLink Howard Bashman , who provides a great and good service with his  urlLink "20 Questions for the Appellate Judge"  series (which if you haven't been reading, you should be), I can't resist a parody.  Thus:  20 Questions for an Incompetent and Largely Unqualified Appellate Judge   1. What are your most favorite and least favorite aspects of being a federal appellate judge?  My favorite is that I don't have to wear anything under my robe.  My least favorite is that neither does my court stenographer, and she is not a handsome woman.  2. Identify the one federal or state court judge, living or dead, whom you admire the most and explain why.  That would have to be Judge Reinhold.  His performances in Beverley Hills Cop I, II, and III demonstrated true comic genius.  In addition, his appearances as "Dr. Crawford" in a recent series of episodes of the hit sitcom, "The King of Queens" have reaffirmed my belief that the sitcom will never die, not when there are comic masters like Judge Reinhold employing their craft.  His role in the 1999 direct-to-video "My Brother The Pig" is a genuine masterpiece of modern cinematic acting.  3. How did you come to President Clinton's attention as a potential nominee to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit?  It was actually President Millard Fillmore who nominated me to the court, back in 1852.  We had met over a game of checkers in the old Central Park on the island of Manhattan (when it was still New Amsterdam).  My ability to survive on three checkers a day, despite a case of malaria, impressed the future President, and as soon as there was an opening on the court, I was his first choice.  4. Seventh Circuit Judge Richard A. Posner has described his own judicial philosophy as "pragmatic." How would you describe your judicial philosophy, and what sort of cases do you find the most difficult to decide?  That's a hard question, mostly because I have no idea what the word "pragmatic" means.  Nevertheless, I will press on with my answer.  I'd say the best word you could use to describe my judicial philosophy is "cool."  I try very hard to keep my personal grooming habits up to date, and my street slang appropriate for the era.  It's very important to me that the crininals see me as an accessible, friendly judge, who understands the modern world they live in, and all the dangers electricity has introduced to our industrializing society.  5. The U.S. Senate's consideration of your nomination to the Tenth Circuit did not proceed to confirmation as rapidly or smoothly as did the federal appellate court nominations of others made at that time.  What do you recall, positively or negatively, about your confirmation process?  I recall very little, due to my inebriated nature during most of that year.  I do remember an incident with Senator Arlen Specter, a baton, and a pair of oversized sunglasses that I'd rather not relive.  It was a traumatic time for us all, especially with the Nikkei Index falling as dramatically as it did, and the state of Wyoming seceding from the union.  6. You publicly criticized President Clinton and his administration for failing to change the national bird from the bald eagle to the ferret.  Especially considering the ferret is not even a bird, such public criticism of a sitting President is unusual coming from a federal judge. In retrospect, do you believe you acted appropriately?  No, I don't.  I regret my actions tremendously.  I was under the impression the ferret was a bird after a long weekend spent in the country playing shuffleboard.  In retrospect, I would have asked that we replace the national flower with poison ivy, since it has long been my opinion that all poison ivy needs is some tender love and affection, and then it wouldn't feel the need to be so poisonous.  I thank you for asking that difficult question and letting me clear up the record once and for all.  7. If you could reverse or alter the outcome of any single U.S. Supreme Court ruling, which ruling would you select and why?  The U.S. Supreme Court?  Is that the one with Justice Rehnquist, or the one with the animals?  I always get it confused with Pet Court on the Animal Planet.  In any event, assuming I've got the right court in mind, I would have to say that I would reverse Marbury v. Madison, because I'm really not sure I trust judges to be "interpreting" the decisions of the other branches of government, especially since I've never seen a copy of this mysterious "Constitution" people are always talking about.  8. What qualities do you look for in deciding whom to hire as a law clerk, and are there any sorts of candidates you wish were applying but haven?t been?  I look for students who have criminal records.  Seriously.  I believe that experience in prison, especially for first-degree murder, gives my clerks the ability to better understand the plight of the defendants in the cases I try, and also gives me the flexibility to use them to bring a more "creative" end to cases I find it difficult to decide.  The best clerk I've ever had in fact was in the middle of serving four consecutive life terms when I brought him on for a season.  I barely had to write any opinions that year.  The parties just kept disappearing.  It was one of the most rewarding years of my career.  I wish more convicted rapists would apply.  9. A reporter who covers the Tenth Circuit advises me that you often wear headphones while hearing cases. Is the reporter correct as a factual matter?  Yes.  I enjoy listening to the sweet sounds of the Eurythmics while counsel argues its case.  It helps explain why most of my questioning from the bench makes no sense.  10. What is your view concerning whether the Ninth Circuit should be split into two or more circuits, and how do you respond to the reasons favoring a split that others have raised?   I fully support any opportunity my colleagues might have to move up in the pecking order.  If splitting the ninth circuit, would allow some of those judges to be promoted to the eighth circuit, or even the seventh circuit, and open up a spot for me to be promoted to the ninth circuit, I am all in favor.  I believe we've been too slow to promote those judges who everyone acknowledges are excellent to better and better circuits.  My good friend on the Third Circuit should at least be on the Second Circuit, if not the First Circuit.  I believe we should create the strongest bench we can, for when we go up against the Canadian judges in softball games.  11. You are considered one of the foremost experts on few if any aspects of the law.  What has caused your profound lack of intellectual curiosity?    It's just one of my trademarks.  I appreciate the compliment.  12. In December 1994, Highlights magazine published a profile of you. Were you pleased with how that turned out, and did the profile contain anything about you that you found to be incorrect or misleading?  I believe that I am closer to Gallant than to Goofus, and I resented the mischaracterization.  Also, I only found four of the seven pictures they claimed were hidden in the lines of my robe.  I think they should make the puzzles easier or children will get frustrated.  13. How did you happen to become Judge Posner's close friend, what interests do you have in common with him, and how do you avoid letting the major disagreements the two of you have had over cases from becoming personal?   Judge Posner always pays for lunch.  I wish he would work harder and write more books.  14. Is the salary now paid to federal appellate judges too low? What should federal appellate judges be paid or, perhaps less controversially, how would one determine what the proper salary should be?  I disagree with most of my colleagues on this one.  For the work I do, I am paid much too much.  I think federal appellate judges should work for free, and be forced to turn to a life of prostitution to support themselves.  I believe there are many women out there who would find me and my colleagues quite appealing for a night of unbridled passion at a reasonable cost.  15. Of all of the many opinions you have written since joining the Ninth Circuit, which opinion or opinions stand out as your favorites?  There is a warm spot in my heart for the concurrence I wrote in Brown v. Board of Education, even though I was never asked to decide the case.  I hope my words, "what does it matter anyway since we all know grade school is a complete waste of time and energy," serve to light the way in the future and bring us to conquer new galaxies.  16. What is the best advice you ever received on being an effective federal appellate judge, and from whom did you receive it?  My cat told me to watch out for falling bricks.  It has served to be effective advice, although I have never served in a courtroom made of brick.  17. In March 2004, you will turn 90 years old, thereby qualifying to elect senior status if you wish. What are your thoughts about when you would consider cutting back on your workload at the court, providing you with more time to pursue other interests?  As long as I get my discount in the courtroom cafeteria, and my handicapped parking space, I have no interest in lowering my workload to make room for the youngsters.  Let them sleep their way to the top like I did.   18. What are the most significant ways that attorneys practicing before you can improve their appellate briefs and their appellate oral arguments?  I wish they would just forget the oral arguments and let me decide the case by spinning my verdict wheel, like I usually do.  It's all a waste of time anyway, since I don't listen to a word any of them say.  19. If you could add a few more hours to each day, how would you spend them?  I would spend them trying to figure out how I was possibly able to contradict the laws of science by adding more hours to the day.  I would probably have to do some research to figure that out, so I might end up typing it into the "Ask Jeeves" search engine on the Internet.  I love Jeeves.  20. What do you do for enjoyment and/or relaxation in your spare time?  In the spirit of remaining neutral regarding cases I may one day see before me, I spend my spare time euthanizing the elderly, performing late-term abortions, burning crosses, cursing on the steps of the courthouse, defacing the flag, marrying other men, removing handicapped access ramps, and affirmatively acting.

       Dean Loses Primaries, Bares Breast on National TV   (VERMONT) "Wardrobe malfunction" was the term Howard Dean's advisors used to explain why he bared his breast during his concession speech following tonight's primary returns.   There were signs that this was not an accident. It happened during the portion of Dean's stump speech known among his supporters as "Rock Your Vote," in which he promises his supporters to "have you naked by the end of this cadence of standard political rhetoric." Dean's press director had told an MSNBC correspondent to expect "some shocking moments." And some Dean supporters were, no doubt, disappointed to see that it was only his breast that was exposed, and that his nipple was covered by a hanging chad.  It was a disappointing night for the former Vermont governor, who had once hoped to clinch the nomination with the round of contests tonight. Instead, it became just another in a series of campaign missteps. Dean was apologetic: "sometimes our emotions just get the breast -- er, best -- of us."

      Corporations Lesson O' The Day: Master-Servant is actually a legal relationship, so asking someone to be your servant is not an invitation to be beaten with a stick, but in fact simply a reflection of the legal relationship whereby you are responsible, in both contract and tort situations, for his actions.  In fact, we learned, most vice-presidents are servants.  But taxi drivers are not.  They used to be, but then they moved to this country for freedom.  Want to show off your legal knowledge?  Tell your secretary she's your servant!  She's sure to be impressed.

      A friend of mine wrote tonight's episode of "Yes, Dear" on CBS at 8:00.  Check it out.    Years from now, when he's the Aaron Spelling of his generation, you'll be able to say you saw the  very first episode  of television that Bob Smiley had on the air.  He's going places.  Seriously, he's an awesome, awesome writer, and it's super-cool that he's got something on TV.  I have no doubt tonight's episode will restore your faith in the half-hour sitcom format.  Okay, that probably puts too much pressure on it.  But, really, check it out.  I wouldn't miss it.  I'm serious about the Aaron Spelling thing.  I'd put money on it.     CBS, 8:00  (eastern).  If any of your friends have a Nielsen Box, tell them too.

      One of my friends got engaged this past weekend, and I thought I'd send him and his fiance a card.  A paper card, since that's nicer than the Hallmark e-variety.  Although those are better than nothing I guess.  So I went to the local pharmacy-with-a-greeting-card-section expecting a wealth of choices in the "engagement" category.  Nope.  There was one "engagement" heading mixed in with the wedding cards, but it was empty.  So I had to be creative.  Birthday? No.  Thank You?  No.  Wedding?  Uh... maybe... except they all say "wedding" on them.  No good.  Anniversary?  Is there a Happy Negative-1st Anniversary card?  No.  Sympathy?  Well... no.  Wrong tone.  Get Well Soon?  Now that would be quite a card to receive for your engagement!  Congratulations?  Oh, yeah, that makes sense.  So I started looking at the congratulations cards.  "Bravo!"  Nope, not quite.  "Congratulations on all your successes."  Uh, no.  "Good things come to those who wait."  Perhaps.  But perhaps that would send an odd and confusing message.  "Your achievements make us proud."  Who's writing these cards?  "You've finally done it!"  Would I *ever* want to receive a card that said that?  There's an edge to that "finally," isn't there?  Anyway, I eventually settled on a card that just said "Congratulations" with pictures of balloons and fireworks, and I wrote a message in.

      I had my first day of corporations class today.  A corporation is a bunch of people doing some stuff.  More in the weeks to come.  :)  This is my first class where we don't have assigned daily reading assignments, but instead we have a list of the pages we'll be covering and the thought that we'll be covering 30-40 pages a day, so we should just read ahead as appropriate.  Which at first glance seemed kind of strange but after a few minutes of playing with that thought in my head while the professor talked about something I'm sure will be important for the final exam I realized it's really just as sensible as the alternative and usually professors are constantly adjusting the reading assignments anyway, so it's really no different from anything else.  The other line on the syllabus I was initially perplexed by was "please do not use email either for appointments or for class questions," which is the opposite of most professors here, who often request we use e-mail for that stuff because it's easier.  But I guess with a big class, one could just as easily prefer to have students call or visit rather than be subjected to a constant flow of e-mails.  Plus it probably gets rid of the questions that a student could just as well answer himself but since e-mail is so easy... because you wouldn't (or at least I wouldn't) call a professor to ask a question without really being pretty desperate to know the answer, whereas I might e-mail in a moment of frustration, although I probably wouldn't do that either.  Maybe I'd send a telegram or something less obtrusive like that.  I'd whisper it from the back of the room when other people were talking, knowing the professor wouldn't hear me.  I'd write a note but never mail it.  I'd leave a message on my own outgoing voicemail message, just in case the professor happens to accidentally call me, so he would hear the question and perhaps answer it.  I'd send it to someone else, on the other side of the world, perhaps, and see if that whole six degrees of separation thing actually works.  (Okay, time to end this thought experiment that's getting increasingly less amusing, to me and to you.)  So maybe it's all moot anyway.  (Not moot like a court.  Just plain moot.)  Meanwhile, since the class is at 8:30 in the morning, once 10:30 hits, on Monday and Tuesday, I'm done for the day.  Oh, except for the other stuff I should be doing.

      I got a letter today from the firm I'm working for this summer.  "First, please complete the attached form...." "Second, orientation dates...." "Third, the firm offers a salary advance for all summer associates...."    What??    They barely even know me and they want to give me money?  I'm tempted to just take the money and run.  To Canada.  How did I get here so fast?  Law school just started yesterday.  I feel like I was just six years old and afraid to walk down the hall to the bathroom by myself because the hall monsters would swallow me alive (I went to a dangerous elementary school; we lost three or four children a year to the hall monsters, more during leap years).    I'm not ready to be an adult.  There's still too much I didn't accomplish as a kid.  I don't really tie my shoes all that well.  I never beat the last level of Super Mario Brothers.  I've never been arrested.  Tomorrow, we start another semester of classes.  It's old hat by now.  One of my friends has been wondering aloud for the past couple of weeks what he's going to do with himself for the 155-odd hours a week we're not in class, now that, really, there's not much new on the horizon.  We finished the recruiting process, we're way past the law review competition, exams no longer really matter, we're pretty much in every extracurricular activity we're planning to join by now (although it's never too late to convert to Judaism and join the Jewish Law Students Association, I tell him).  He's thinking about learning to play the oboe, or making a really big rubber band ball.  These are not valuable uses of our time (with apologies to oboe players).    But what else?  You stick the recruiting season in so early and... no, that's not where I want this train of thought to go.  That's too serious.  I don't really know how to reform the legal education and law firm recruitment industries to meet everyone's needs and not make the last half of law school feel like an exercise in thumb-twiddling.    Instead, I thought I'd just come up with some ways to spend the other 155 hours of the week I'm not in class this semester:  6 hours alphabetizing my CD collection 3 hours seeing if I really can suffocate myself with a plastic bag 5 hours building a tower of toenail clippings 11 hours watching the Paris Hilton video over and over again 2 hours flossing 4 hours watching my cell phone battery recharge 12 hours sorting the Fruity Pebbles by color 1/2 hour testing the smoke detector 28 minutes refolding my sweaters 2 minutes on the phone with my mom 8 hours figuring how many licks it takes to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop 16 hours playing Spider Solitaire 9 hours making sure none of the pages in any of my casebooks are missing 23 hours crying 34 hours watching "Full House" reruns (There really are 68 episodes of Full House on each week, on basic cable.  Sixty-eight.  Unbelievable.)  and, oh, I forgot: 14 hours sleeping (practice for the law firm job) 7 hours eating-slash-collating random bits of paper (more practice for the law firm job)  Total: 155 hours.  I'm ready for a great semester.  :)

      Hmmm.  Didn't even realize this was a career.  I'm on a couple of alumni e-mail lists from Princeton, and on one of them there was just a post:   My daughter will be entering her senior year.... She is very much interested in an internship/apprenticeship this summer, anywhere in the U.S., in the field of glassblowing. She is very serious about glassblowing as a career.... If anyone has any leads or ideas... Hmmm.  Glassblowing as a career.  Interesting.  Sounds like fun.  And never  a question about what gifts to give on holidays and birthdays.  "Thanks so much for the vase!  I put it right next to the candy dish and the candlestick holder!  And the other seven vases!"

       urlLink How Appalling  reports on a post I had up for about an hour last night before I realized I was just tired and not making much sense, and I'd be better off deleting it.  His (or her) post explains my post pretty well, which was basically that it kind of bothered me that someone would say that its site, which has been up for a week and is essentially a one-joke parody of Howard Bashman's  urlLink How Appealing  is funnier than mine, because, while it's amusing, it probably can't sustain for much longer, and is kind of mean-spirited anyway because Howard is a real person and not a faceless corporate institution.  Whatever.  I took  urlLink Overpundit 's post too personally and it's not a big deal, and that's why I deleted the post....   UPDATE:  urlLink Overpundit  makes nice in a follow-up post. UPDATE 2:  urlLink How Appalling  makes nice too.

      Random stuff:  1. It's interesting how different cities have different quirks of law.  Like in Boston, all restaurant menus contain a warning about eating raw and undercooked food, and how that might not be so good for you.  Even places where nothing on the menu ought to be raw or undercooked (as opposed to sushi places), there's still that unnerving warning, forcing me to check my chicken just a few too many times.  But in New York, instead we get signs in bathrooms about how employees must wash their hands -- because it's the law.  If I owned a restaurant, I'd be a little peeved if my employees only washed their hands after going to the bathroom because it's the law.  In fact, I'd want to put up a sign that says "Our employees would wash their hands even if it wasn't the law, because they don't want to get their pee in your food."  Only I'd say it more tastefully.  When I was in DC for a few weeks last summer, the only quirk I remember noticing is that they made a big deal about not leaving behind any "articles" on the subway.  Which made me extra-cautious with my Entertainment Weekly and Sports Illustrated (no, I don't read The New Yorker and Harper's Weekly... I'm just not that cultured).  Ah, federalism.  Without it, every state would have the same warnings and customs, and that wouldn't be much fun, now would it?

      "Yo Momma" jokes that are only funny to law students, and even then not so much, inspired by this uninspired line I tossed off in conversation this evening, and which actually got a pretty charitable response compared to what I thought it deserved as I said it: "The professor's so old, we know he clerked for Justice Harlan, but we're not sure which one."  "Yo Momma's so poor she can't afford to file for bankruptcy." "Yo Momma's so fat she wants to sue McDonalds but can't get up off the couch to file the lawsuit." "Yo Momma's so stupid she doesn't know the difference between rational basis review and strict scrutiny." "Yo Momma's so mentally ill she might actually have a reason to plead insanity instead of just faking it to get out of jail." "Yo Momma's so deformed that if she had a skin graft operation that made hair grow out of her hands, it would be an improvement." "Yo Momma's so tired she couldn't even do twelve pages of Con Law reading before falling asleep last night." "Yo Momma's so sad she makes first-year associates look like they just won the lottery." "Yo Momma's so fat or stupid or both she had to take the LSAT twice just to get scores that added up to her weight."

      Every time I'm home on a break, there's always a little something new to see.  When I came home for winter break, we had a new back porch.  Last summer, we got a DVD player for the first time.  And last spring I discovered that my mom had bought new toilet seats for the upstairs and downstairs bathrooms.  This time, it's TiVo.  Well, almost TiVo.  They switched from Cablevision to DirectTV, because it's cheaper, and DirectTV came with a TiVo-like digital video recording system, and even the TiVo remote control that the New York Times lauded a few months ago in an article I'd link to if it wasn't too far in the archives to make it cost money (but you can find it on Lexis for sure).  I like TiVo (and I'm going to call it TiVo instead of DirectTV, because that's who makes it and it's really what it is), but I thought I'd like it more.  I have some friends who have it, and love it.  I'm intrigued by the ability to pause live television, and then come back and watch it about 10 minutes behind so you can fast forward through all of the commercials.  The ability to record a "season pass" of every new episode of a program is cool.  The ease of use, to set up recording, or to play something back, is fine -- although I'm okay with programming a normal VCR, so this isn't really doing all that much for me.  And, as the Times promised, the remote control is nicely contoured and easy to use (although the TV-power-on button is really hard to find if you don't know where it is, and flummoxed me for a good three or four minutes).  What I expect is sort of cool is the TiVo recommendations, where it gives you programs based on what you've already recorded.  My mom turned that feature off because it was giving her stuff in Spanish for no reason she could come up with.  But I've turned it back on while I'm home, because I'm curious what it will give me, now that I've recorded The Apprentice, a "freeview" concert on the "music choice" channel, and a few episodes of a show I read about on the Sundance Channel called Tanner '88, a fictional behind-the-scenes "documentary" of a presidential campaign, that initially ran on HBO in 1988 and is written by Garry Trudeau (Doonesbury) and directed by Robert Altman (famous movies I can't name).  They had 4 episodes back-to-back (-to-back-to-back) on yesterday and I recorded them.  I've watched one and it was okay, but didn't compel me to immediately watch the rest, although I'm sure I'll get to them before the week is through.  But it strikes me that there's nothing *bad* about TiVo -- they've done a very good job creating a set of features no one can really dislike.  It's not like a computer, where you have to learn stuff and buy stuff and plug stuff in, and do all sorts of time-intensive activities at the start that can make it prohibitively painful to start -- although obviously computers have enough benefits that many, many, many people have decided it's worth the initial investment to become able to use one.  But TiVo presents none of those problems, and although the upside isn't like what you can get out of a computer, it's reasonably cool.  So I expect this will become standard stuff pretty soon.  Man, this post isn't funny at all except for the gratuitous toilet mention up top.  Oh well, yesterday's was hopefully funny, and maybe something later.

      Theyre telling us that next week, well be given course selection information for next year.  Due to an obscure provision of the Privacy in Information Act, Ive been able to get my hands on a copy of the course catalog prior to its official release at a press conference next Monday, which will be attended by dignitaries from around the world along with former child stars Danica McKellar and Rider Strong.  My advance copy has allowed me to preview some of the upcoming courses in the space below.    Janet Jacksons Wardrobe Malfunction and Other Issues in Media Law and Regulation Visiting Professor George Carlin  Prof. Carlin, who is currently appearing in the hit film Jersey Girl, starring Ben Affleck and featuring Jennifer Lopez (but she dies within the first fifteen minutes of the movie, obviously), will be offering this course, which will examine (over and over again) Janet Jacksons Super Bowl overexposure in order to determine how the law should treat naked body parts on television, and whether we ought to create a big, long code that will flummox future generations of lawyers.  (This course will be rated TV-MA for adult language, sexual situations, and, despite the pleadings of the faculty committee, occasional full-frontal nudity by Prof. Carlin.)  Losing Election Law Visiting Professor Howard Dean  Prof. Dean, who will also be teaching a class at the Medical School titled, Its Not Easy To Restart Your Medical Practice When Much Of America Thinks Youre Kind Of Loony, offers a course that examines new law that could be enacted to help losing candidates turn their fortunes around despite massive media mishaps that turn the public against them.  Among the legal regimes discussed: banning voters from voting for anyone but Howard Dean, erasing peoples memories, turning back time, and more easily translating fanatic Internet support to actual votes.  The course will have a companion weblog, which will get more hits than there are people on the planet but still not increase enrollment beyond three or four liberal nutcases.  Child Pornography Visiting Professors Paul Reubens and Michael Jackson  Professors Reubens and Jackson, who will team-teach the course in a fully-equipped bedroom rigged with cameras, in front of a live studio audience of ten-year-olds, will announce the complete syllabus later, but want to emphasize that this will be a hands-on class.  Students with children of their own are especially invited to enroll and add their unique perspectives.  Securities Regulation Visiting Professor Martha Stewart  Prof. Stewart acknowledges that many students may be more comfortable taking this class from a more familiar professor, especially since the law school does have a number of talented and experienced scholars in the area.  However, she promises to provide food and drink at every class meeting, adorn the classroom with pleasant furnishings and fragrant greenery, and give every student the tools to make his or her own decorative book jacket, to hide how boring Securities Regulation really is.  Expect to do five to ten hours of outside work per week for the class.  The class will meet on Mondays and Wednesdays, but not Fraud-days.  Prof. Stewart apologizes for that not at all being a funny joke.  Other offerings not funny enough to get a whole paragraph:  Animal Law Visiting Professor Roy Horn  Narcotics Regulation Visiting Professor Whitney Houston  Seminar on Gay Marriage Visiting Lecturer Jerry Falwell  Carbohydrate Law Visiting Professor Ghost of Robert Atkins

      OK.  If you're not a baseball fan, this post just won't be very interesting to you.  I posted something possibly-amusing about law school a few hours ago, so you can just scroll on down to that (or click  urlLink here  to let your browser do the work for you.  I just finished my 5th of 5 fantasy baseball drafts.  Although no one cares but me, I figured I'd write something up in summary.  Reds OF Austin Kearns has the distinction of being the only player on all 5 of my teams.  Probably means I'm overvaluing him, but that's OK.  Royals SP Jeremy Affeldt, Angels RP Francisco Rodriguez, Blue Jays RP Aquilino Lopez, and Indians RP David Riske are each on 4 of my teams.  With Riske and Lopez, it illustrates my usual strategy of going with risky young closers after the Gagnes and Smoltzes of the world have been taken, instead of using a high-round pick on one, or grabbing mid-tier closers like Benitez or Hoffman.  Although, I did end up with Mariano Rivera on 2 teams, and Arthur Rhodes, Jason Isringhausen, Joe Borowski, and Troy Percival on one team each.  Also Ryan Wagner on two teams, and Damaso Marte, Jose Valverde and Rafael Soriano on one team each, in leagues that count holds.  My final round pick in another hold league was David Weathers; I also have Mike Timlin in that league.  And I think that rounds out my entire bullpen.    I have a handful of players each on three teams -- Johan Santana, Jake Peavy, Brandon Webb, and Javy Lopez.  With the exception of Lopez, who in each case I grabbed because if I didn't take him I'd end up without a top tier catcher -- I have Varitek and Kendall on the other two teams; I probably spend too many picks considering position scarcity too heavily... unless there are some real deals available, I tend to try and fill my infield before my outfield.  Affeldt, Santana, Peavy, and Webb show my bias toward young starting pitchers.  Young players in general I guess -- the relievers I took were mostly young too.  I like when there's upside.  I don't even rank players like Jamie Moyer, Garret Anderson, Kevin Millwood -- too predictable; low risk but low reward.  Roy Oswalt, who's one of my favorite players, largely because I drafted him on a bunch of teams the last few years and he did well, only fell to me once -- he kept being "next on my list" and someone else would grab him.  I've got Rich Harden on two teams, Tim Redding on two teams, and Kerry Wood on one.  Missed out on Prior.  Last year I had Zito on a bunch of my teams; this year I have Tim Hudson on two.  Didn't plan on it, but ended up grabbing Kevin Brown on two teams, when he fell unjustifiably low.  I have Randy Wolf and Matt Morris on one team each, and, with early-round picks, grabbed Pedro Martinez in one league, and Javier Vazquez and Randy Johnson in rounds two and three of the sixteen-team draft I just finished... the league counts strikeouts, and I felt they were both the best available players at that point, even though I had no plans to grab either one.  I thought I'd end up with Miguel Batista on more than one team, but I kept waiting too long, so only grabbed him once.  And I've got Ted Lilly on one team.  I had him on a lot more than that last year, and he was okay... but I thought he'd be better.  Carlos Beltran is one of my favorite players, because of the power-speed combo.  But he went in the first round in 4 of my 5 drafts -- I took him in the second round in the 5th league.  Bobby Abreu is also one of my favorites, and also just ended up with him in one league.  Besides Kearns, who's on all 5 teams, the only outfielders I have in more than one league are Geoff Jenkins (2), Magglio Ordonez (2), and Adam Dunn (2). Vladimir Guerrero and Manny Ramirez fell to me the second round of one league each; I grabbed Griffey late in one league, Jim Edmonds in another, and grabbed Suzuki in the 8th round on one team.  I have Larry Walker on two teams, Carl Crawford on one team, and, in one deep league, Jason Bay, Jay Gibbons, and Bobby Kielty as outfielders 4-6.  In the infield, second base seemed especially shallow this year.  I ended up with Alfonso Soriano as my first round pick in two leagues, and grabbed Marcus Giles in two others.  In the fifth, and as a backup in another, I have Ray Durham, who's at least steady if not spectacular. And I have Vidro and Brian Roberts each in one league.  At shortstop I took A-Rod as my first round pick in two leagues (one where I was seeded first; the other third, but Bonds and Pujols were the first two to go), and have Furcal in two and Reyes in one league.  At third base I wanted Chavez, but ended up with Rolen in two leagues, Blalock in two, and Dmitri Young in one league, out of desperation (and Morgan Ensberg snatched up by the guy who picked prior to me).  At first base, I got Helton with pick 5 in one league -- hadn't planned on that, since there are so many solid first basemen, but OBP and SLG are two of the stats, and Helton's numbers are so huge.  I have Mike Sweeney (so many Royals... him, Beltran, Affeldt...) in two leagues, and I have Huff, Millar, and Fullmer in one league. Josh Phelps as a utility guy in two leagues, and Edgar Martinez in one.  5 teams, 72 total players to root for.  Fun!

      The blog  urlLink myoclonic  has a list of the most overused phrases in law school.  His/her picks include "with all due respect," "reasonably foreseeable," "reification," and then a bunch of phrases I've never ever ever heard, like "lacuna in the law" (???) and "disjunctive element" (?).  I like the idea, so I'm going to steal it.   Jeremy's Most Overused Law School Phrases   -- Objective manifestation of subjective intent -- Excuse me, I think you're sitting in my seat. -- Three-pronged test -- Well, I happen to think...  -- Strict scrutiny -- Why is attendance so low today? -- According to the dissent... -- Will this be on the exam? -- Rules versus standards -- Is that a highlighter in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? -- Known or should have known -- I think that's Bluebook rule 14.5 -- The time-value of money -- I'm sorry, I just had some cafeteria food and need to go vomit. -- Administrability -- According to my student loan officer... -- Promotes the alienability of property -- Could you call on someone else?  I didn't get a chance to do the reading. -- One hundred percent of students received job offers last year -- No, I'm sorry, that's incorrect -- This meeting will be mandatory -- Here's another hypothetical... -- Please stop playing solitaire in class -- Okay, let's take a ten-minute break and when we come back we'll move on to the next case.

      Any Blue Jays fans out there will want to check out  urlLink this long but excellent  season preview.  Link courtesy of  urlLink The Hardball Times .  Also for baseball fans: tomorrow afternoon I have my fifth (and final) fantasy baseball draft of the pre-season (yes, I know I am slightly obsessed, but I will stop writing about fantasy baseball once the season starts, I promise)... I'm hoping to write up some sort of draft success/failure wrap-up that will also serve as a baseball season preview of sorts.  Expect that Monday or Tuesday.  Other posts-in-the-pipeline news (clearly I'm stretching for inspiration here, and kind of want to go to sleep...) -- course selection for next year is coming soon; as soon as the registrar posts a catalog online, I expect to be able to milk that for some fun posts.  Also, I had dinner with a pair of fellow bloggers tonight that I'd hadn't met before and one of the topics that came up was how blogging about goup blogging can be fun, so maybe I'll write something up about the ill-fated En Banc, or the hopefully-better-fated  urlLink De Novo  (which, incidentally, is still looking for people interested in writing something for our Internet Law & Society symposium coming on April 5.  E-mail me if you want to write something we might want to post there -- whether you're a fellow blogger or just a reader).

      The Office of Public Interest Advising just sent out a job listing for a summer position in Newark, NJ that ends with the line, "For those unfamiliar with Newark, it is located 7 miles from Manhattan and is only a 15 minute train ride away."  How about this: "For those unfamiliar with Newark, you probably want to stay that way."  My description is probably more accurate.  Sorry, Newark.

       Angry Book Review   Trading Up: The New American Luxury, by Michael J. Silverstein and Neil Fiske   The authors of "Trading Up" should be forced to "Trade Down" and go live in a housing project for a couple of years.  The book is a well-researched, well-written, nauseating celebration of the wasteful and overindulgent consumer culture in America.  Victoria's Secret.  Panera Bread.  Williams-Sonoma.  Belvedere Vodka.  What these companies (and more) have in common is that they're of marginally higher quality than their competitors, but through manipulative branding that takes advantage of people's emotional needs and desires, they're able to raise their price points and "rocket" to huge profits off the demand curve.  I don't dispute the book -- I think the authors have done a fantastic job identifying what it is companies like The Cheesecake Factory and Callaway Golf and Samuel Adams beer are doing: making high-quality products, and pitching them as lifestyle choices, as more than just "things you buy" but as part of what gives you an identity and what makes you feel good about your consumption -- but the tone of the book is kind of sickening; it's a celebration of consumer manipulation and of shrewd branding that makes people feel like consumer products can change their lives.  "They are my little mechanical buddies;" "They are part of my family" -- these are people talking about their $2,000 Whirlpool washer and dryer.  It's disturbing and sad -- but the book uses these quotes to illustrate a success story.  Okay -- it is a success story.  But not for society, and not for these people who, because of broader societal issues, are left to rely on their appliances for emotional support.  Buying a $50 pair of tongs at Williams-Sonoma does not make me happy, and I think if it  does  make people happy, then we have things to worry about and shouldn't just be applauding Williams-Sonoma on making consumers believe that their neighbors will think less of them if they buy their tongs at K-Mart.  I give the book credit for being awfully thought-provoking -- for getting me to think about these issues, and realize that there are certainly products I buy that I could just as easily buy the generic version of and it wouldn't make a difference.  Shampoo comes to mind, actually, although it's an awfully negligible expense in the scheme of things -- not that what I buy is such a luxury brand, but still, I could save $2.00 if I bought the CVS bottle next to it, and I'm sure there's a negligible difference if any.  But reading this book makes me want to never buy a brand name anything again, and scold people for reaching for the finely milled pet food when Walmart's Ol' Red will do just fine, and actually makes me angry that we live in a world where the thought of consumer products filling emotional needs is lauded and not shamefully disturbing.

      After a subway ride, bus ride, subway ride, bus ride, and short car ride (total trvael time: a shade under 6 hours), I have made the journey from school to home, and I suppose it's now Spring Break.  My first Spring Break activity is a dental appointment at 5:30.  My second Spring Break activity is taking my grandmother to the supermarket.  My third Spring Break activity will probably involve another weblog post.  :)  Two things I'm looking forward to about Spring Break:  1. Seeing friends (and family) I haven't seen since winter break 2. Being able to watch Mets games on TV (even if they're only spring training games)  More later.

      I just returned from the law school newspaper's newsroom.  I say "newsroom," but it's really more like a "room" where there are some computers, a printer, and a small handful of people.  Small handful for former baseball pitcher Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown, that is.  Anyway, in addition to writing my column, I'm "copy editor," which I may or may not have mentioned before but probably not since it's usually not that interesting.  So I read everything and put some extra commas in, and then I leave and the other people add some misspellings to make it look like I haven't been doing my job.  Anyway ("will he get to the point of this story already???), usually I get down there at about 4:30 and there's a person or two and a half a newspaper laid out so I can start reading stuff.  Today there was no one there, and the door was locked.  But I have a key.  So I went in, and saw on the computer that only two pages had been laid out -- 4 opinion columns.  "Hmmm," I thought.  "No one's here, and there's not much of a paper... running late, or no issue this week but they just didn't tell the columnists?"  You should already have some idea what the answer is, or there wouldn't be much of a story, would there?  So I figured either way I'd copyedit what was there, so I did, and then checked e-mail, and checked e-mail again, and checked some more e-mail.  And then the editor in chief came in and said there's no paper this week because Spring Break is next week, and so people may not bother picking up a copy before they leave... and that'll make it relevant... and whatever, not a big deal.  Oh well.  But the real point of my story (you mean this whole thing is just a prelude to the actual point???) is that in about a half hour I will return to the "newsroom" where we will do elections for next year.  There are three positions that get elected: publisher, editor-in-chief, and business manager.  There are two candidates for editor-in-chief (I am neither of them), and zero candidates for the other two positions.  The other jobs -- news editor, editorial page editor, copy editor, photo editor, food editor, film editor, biased-coverage-of-law-review editor, promoting-his-own-political-agenda - at-one-of-the-extremes - although-it-doesn't-really-matter-which-one editor, music editor, and features editor (although we lived without features editor this year) -- are all appointed by the editor in chief and are usually picked out of the flurry of applications that are submitted prior to the election so as to be waiting in a pile for the new editor-in-chief to peruse.  I submitted an application for editorial page editor.  The pile of total applications for the half-dozen or so positions in my list I wasn't making up numbers one.  Including mine.  So clearly there's some sort of interest problem at the newspaper.  Nobody seems to want to be involved.  This is somewhat baffling to me, since the newspaper is one of the six or eight activities I'm involved in that I most enjoy being a part of.  But my list of activities includes pretty much everything without the word "legal" in its description, so maybe that explains it.  But even if you're here because you want to be the next Oliver Wendell Holmes, you do law all day -- why not do some less-law extracurricular activities?  For fun.  And because there are lots of smart people here, who I'm sure no matter how passionate they are about the law, also have other interests.  Or they used to.  And maybe they're just getting their fulfillment in non-law-school activities, or in stuff I don't know about, or non-law stuff I just don't happen to be that interested in.  But I feel like we should be able to muster more than 3 or 4 or 5 interested students from among a student body of 1800.  When  urlLink Aaron Gleeman * can't get on the sports staff of his college newspaper, but at Harvard Law School we can't fill two out of three elected positions of leadership, something seems messed up.  *Aaron Gleeman, who I've almost linked to a couple of times but I don't think I ever have actually, is a college student who writes a baseball weblog that's awfully solid.  It's well-written and really pretty compelling, possibly even if you're not in five fantasy baseball leagues.  Anyway, he's written a couple of times about trying to get on his college paper's sports staff (University of Minnesota) but it's really competitive and there are no spots, even though he's clearly a solid writer and deserves one.  My only point is that people who can write well, wanting to write and not being able to is the opposite of here, where no one wants to do anything.   That's all.

      The law school a cappella singing group I'm in does a spring concert each year where we give the proceeds to a charity of the group's choosing.  I may have mentioned before that I was advocating we choose the National Association for the Deaf, which I think would be funny, but it's been vetoed because it may be offensive.  So my second suggestion, since we serve beer at the concert, is to donate money to Mothers Against Drunk Driving, or Alcoholics Anonymous.  Again, vetoed.  Offensive.  I mean, I guess I understand.  I tried a third suggestion, in my head I tried to somehow link our singing to those wailing sounds that animals make and suggested the ASPCA, but I'm not sure my thinking really comes across all that clearly with that suggestion.  Anyway, we'll probably end up choosing some actual, legitimate charity whose appearance on our signs won't be designed to cause laughter but rather sympathy and good-hearted feelings like that.  Which I suppose is a good thing.  Two of the songs we're doing are "Like a Prayer" and "God Only Knows" -- perhaps the Atheist Fund or something like that (is there something like that?) should be my next suggestion.  I'm just trying to cause trouble, aren't I?  :)

      I just got an e-mail that definitely looks like it was meant for one person but accidentally got sent to the entire mailing list of a student organization here.  It's not particularly damaging, just sort of amusing:   I think we should send out an email asking for those interested in officer positions.  I also think we should have several positions, to allow folks to pad their resumes....  Sound like a plan? Sounds like a plan.

      Amazon.com user reviews are a marvelous gift that the Internet provides.  Ignoring that most of the reviews are probably posted by the author and his family, and the rest are posted by illiterate devil-worshippers with a personal grudge against the publisher, they can be quite useful.  I wondered what Amazon reviewers had to say about law school casebooks and study guides.  So I did some relatively random and unfocused clicking looking for review snippets I could take out of context.  Here are the results of my exploration into the world of Amazon reviews:  " Overpriced garbage!  This book is printed in very small print, all in one color (blue), on very thin (cheap) paper. How the publisher justifies the ridiculous price is beyond me!"  " This book is terrible.  I thought I was purchasing an Administrative Law text book. This is not a text book. It is a book of this guy's opinion... Further, he says he's a professor at, according to US News, a fourth tier law school."  " Very dry for the interest subject.  The book was edited in 1994 and does not reflect the latest changes in the law, especially European one (including Eastern Europe). In addition it is very dry."  " Horrible Book.  This book was used for my constitutional law class. It is poorly organized and completely fails to relate any constitutional law concepts to each other. It contains little, if any, historical background. All in all, this book is BAD."  " Poor organization and explanations.  Of all the textbooks I've ever had in law school and undergraduate classes, this book is likely the most frustating and the worst.... For those who say this book isn't that bad, have put the bar far too low and also miss the point. There is no requirement that legal textbooks be dry, unorganized, or unhelpful."  " Awful.  This is a terrible book, but unfortunately you probably won't have much choice in whether or not to use it if it is required for your course."  " defective structure.  The problem of corporate groups is the great problem of the corporation law . This book doesn't contain this subject,so I think the main defect of this book lies in the unreasonable structure."  " Confusing.  Property is a difficult subject, therefore, any casebook on the matter should be clear. This casebook, on the other hand, did more harm than good. Every case was followed up by questions with a list of cases to "see." ...The notes seem to be in another language: Latin) are never answered by the student."  " Worst casebook I had in law school.  They don't get much worse than this. The book is worthless, and made Contracts almost impossible to understand. The cases are sliced into strange, sometimes tiny portions, making it hard to elucidate anything from them."  " can't see the forest for the trees.  I used this book for two semesters of contracts. It is the most unpleasant book I have had to read so far in law school. The authors themselves wrote very little. The book consists almost entirely of edited cases and excerpts from law review articles. There is essentially a case for every little iota of contract knowledge and it gets very tedious to parse a long case for what is in the end a simple rule. The law review excerpts are often very obtuse."  " very unclear.  This is a very unclear book with horrible, dense prose. The authors seem to have an impressive grasp of securities law, and fill the notes with many meaningful substantive explications of various technical points, but they are basically just awful writers, which makes this text a serious chore to read."  "So if you choose a contracts supplement, use it w/caution...you could go down a  very bad road  by choosing and relying upon the wrong supplement."

      This week, we have Class Marshal elections.  Class Marshals are the people who "plan" the 3L year -- they organize social activities, find a graduation speaker, make sure we get our caps and gowns... I'm not really sure exactly, but stuff like that... stuff I can't really imagine anyone enjoys doing, but, for whatever reason, people want to do it.  So they run, and we vote for them.  The past few days I've gotten a bunch of e-mails that look sort of like this:   Dear Friends, Acquaintances, and Others in the Facebook,  I am writing first to encourage you to vote in this week's elections for Class Marshal, which may also be spelled Marshall, but I am neither certain nor consistent in my knowledge on this ground.  Second, I am writing to say that if you do vote in the Class Marshall elections, please vote for ME!  Through these past two years in dreary Cambridge, you and I have gotten to know each other through our time spent in rewarding extracurricular pursuits and/or late-night conversations in the dorms and/or in the enriching classroom experiences we have shared and/or nodding an acknowledgement of recognition to each other around campus and the surrounding community when our paths happen to cross and/or none of the above.  You have seen me to be an extraordinary motivator of people and/or highly organized and/or just crazy enough to embrace a position which involves spending my third year of law school planning events for others to enjoy and/or none of the above.  I'm not completely sure whether it will really make a difference in your lives who become the Classs Marsshallls, or why it will make a difference in my own life if I win, but I ask that when you fill out that ballot and/or vote online and/or both, you remember the good times we may or may not have shared, and the qualities you may or may not think I will bring to the position, and you vote for ME!  I also hope you enjoy receiving this e-mail from not only ME! but from every single acquaintance we share in common, sometimes twice.  Thanks, Your Bestest Friend and/or Someone You Barely Know

      "I'm sorry, I don't have time to help you plan that useless event that no one's going to come to.  I have to write my 3L paper."    For 3Ls, this is the Season of Final Hurdles in the long march to graduation.  Everyone here, in order to graduate, needs to write a 3L paper, something of some length, with a faculty advisor, that is somehow about the law.  The obstacles up to this point for 3Ls, before they reach the time of 3L paper writing, have certainly been steep: avoiding the risk of completely falling off the curve and failing all of one's classes; committing some sort of crime heinous enough to get one suspended or expelled; showing up to registration at the right time; not making the proctors mad; paying library fines; avoiding the poisonous cafeteria food; not getting in the way of some particularly driven student who will do 'whatever it takes' to get what he or she wants; steering clear of the runaway snow plows; taking study breaks to drink plenty of vitamin C so as to avoid contracting scurvy; leaving the buildings during fire drills; not getting caught in any automatic handicapped-accessible doors; taking advantage of health services' fine medical care; and not wearing a Yale sweatshirt at football games.  Other than that, it's been pretty smooth sailing for 3Ls up until now, but suddenly things have changed.  No more six-day weekends on a ski trip, or seventy-two-hour Playstation marathons; no more willingness to take a spur-of-the-moment cross-country road trip; no more five-hour lunches; no more sixteen-hour naps; no more can they say, "Library?  I don't even know where the library is!"  Because now they have to write 3L papers, those rigorous research-intensive sophisticated and scholarly explorations of areas of law heretofore poorly understood and barely analyzed.  Yes, each class of 550 Harvard Law students produces 550 extraordinary works of scholarship, each fit to be published in whichever journal pays the most (they do pay, right?) and whichever editor-in-chief agrees to pass along the most useful stock tips (perhaps I have not been paying good enough attention in corporations class to know that this might not exactly be a perfectly legal form of payment).  Well, not quite.  I have it on notice that there are 3Ls across the campus, blending into classrooms and extracurricular activities, who are in fact writing papers that seem, well, less than rigorous.  My top-notch team of investigative interns have uncovered the following 3L paper topics that I believe are worth sharing, in the hope that the students responsible will step forward and acknowledge the lack of serious purpose with which they are undertaking this extraordinary final step in the path toward becoming a lawyer:  >>"Eighteen Thousand Words That Rhyme With Tax" >>"Haiku About Venue Rules" >>"A Diorama of the O.J. Simpson Trial, complete with fake-blood" >>"Collage of Pictures of Justice Scalia in Various States of Undress" >>"A Collection of Short Stories About Prison Rape" >>"A Short Guide To Eating Your Way Through Law School" >>"The Martha Stewart Case: An Analysis Through Flower Arrangements" >>"The Federal Rules of Evidence: A Modern Dance Exploration" >>"Environmental Law (as expressed through a bunch of cups of dirt)" >>"The Influence of Property Law in Jackson Pollock's Art" >>"The Rule of Perpetuities: Examples and Explanations in Pig Latin" >>"These Forty Blank Pages Represent The Rights of Criminals in our Corrupt Legal System"  Clearly, we need reform :)

      No one's been linking to me lately.  Maybe my last couple weeks have been sort of lackluster.  I'm working on it, I promise.  I thought today I'd think outside the box for a bit, and experiment with a cool idea I had this morning.   Twenty Types of Law Students, Each Keyed To A Particular Baseball Player   1. The Barry Bonds  The Barry Bonds is a superstar.  His grades lead the class, his comments in class are a home run every time... he's setting records, no one else is in his league.  It's ridiculous, really.  He's going to be a Supreme Court clerk and everyone knows it.  He's also kind of surly to the media.  2. The Pedro Martinez  He doesn't show up at every class, and sometimes when he shows up he leaves early, but when he's there, he's almost perfect.  He poses hypotheticals no one can figure out.  He makes leaps of reasoning no one can follow. He's brilliant.  But fragile.  3. The Albert Pujols  He was aces from day one.  Shocking, really.  Came in knowing way too much about the law.  There are rumors he attended some other law school beforehand, and he's not as inexperienced as he says, but no one's been able to prove it.  In any case, he's unbelievable.  Just can't find a specialty.  First it was Con Law, then they needed him to study Criminal Law.  Then Property.  Now maybe back to Criminal Law.  But anywhere he goes, he's awesome.  4. The Todd Helton  He's good.  But not as good as it seems.  He cheats.  Well, not really.  It's just circumstances.  His casebook has 40% more answers than everyone else's.  His papers take up 40% more pages.  It's weird.  People have said they should make him take harder exams, or at least curve his performance in a different way.  But his raw numbers look tremendous.  And he's good.  He's just not  that  good.  5. The Roger Clemens  You thought he graduated, but it turns out he's coming back for another year.  He's only going to take classes he's really interested in, and maybe part of the reason he's come back is because his best friend just transferred to this law school, and he wants to hang out with him.  All of his children have the initials J.D., like the law degree, except for his adopted foreign child, who has the initials L.L.M.  6. The Derek Jeter  All the girls want to date him.  And he's definitely a solid student, his grades are up there, his moot court team keeps winning the championship, year after year after year -- they just do what it takes.  But he's not as perfect as it seems.  He has weaknesses.  In-class exams, not that strong.  It appears he is sometimes, but the results don't bear it out.  Little range to think outside the box.  And his speed is leaving him.  He doesn't always finish on time.  But, aw, isn't he adorable?   7. The Barry Larkin  He's been here forever!  He took a leave of absence last year to deal with a computer virus, which ended up being worse than they thought.  He could have transferred a bunch of times, but hasn't.  Sacrificing career opportunities to stay at his hometown school.  He's outlived his welcome, but there he is, every fall, signing up for classes, talking about how this will be the year he goes to class every day and takes his exams... but then, lately, something always seems to happen, and it doesn't work out for him.  He's not getting any younger.  But he won't leave!  8. The Eric Gagne  Phenomenal.  Just don't ask him any follow-up questions.  Another student's having trouble answering the professor's question, he steps right in and takes over.  Right answer, almost every time.  But the professor sticks with him, and then you get problems.  1, 2, 3 questions he's fine.  More than that and you start exposing weaknesses.  But he'll answer 'em every day, day after day without fail.  Also wears funny glasses, and rumors are he may be Canadian.  9. The Randy Johnson  This student is really not a particularly attractive fellow, and impossibly tall too.  But even though he started out kind of erratic, never sure whether he'd be even close with his answer or what, he's really blossomed into quite a performer.  His legal analysis moves quicker than anyone else's, can blow an argument right by a judge, and it seems like no one's ever going to catch up with him, no matter how long he goes.  He'll talk for nine hours, ten hours, eleven hours if the situation calls for it, and still be right on his game.  But he kind of looks like he needs a shower.  10. The Joe McEwing  Aw, he tries so hard.  He'll do anything you ask.  He'll write a brief, he'll outline the cases, he'll memorize a long list of names for no reason at all.  His notes are color-coded, he always shows up to class, he sits right in the front, he listens so carefully.  But all that effort is the baseline for him -- it's what he needs to do to survive.  He can't speed-read like the guy in the third row, he can't articulate his argument like the girl in the back.  But he tries.  He really tries.  He'll end up a partner in five years, too, because he'll put in the hours.  11. The Jason Giambi  He's gotta be on something.  Ritalin, maybe?  Drinking too many Red Bulls?  Maybe speed?  Not sure, but something.  Rumors are flying.  He was named in the big bootleg-study-guide scandal.  He's always been a powerhouse contributor, but now people are starting to wonder.  Is it all him, or is he getting help from somewhere?  Will we ever really know?  12. The Ben Grieve  First year he made the honor roll.  And then something happened.  Did he stop trying, sit in his dorm playing video games all day?  Did the material just get too hard?  Is he not as driven as his classmates?  They had such high hopes... and now he's transferred to Thomas Cooley and they're not even sure he'll graduate.  Gosh.  13. The Manny Ramirez  Everybody hates him, but you've gotta admit he's smart.  Gotta admit he's one of the most talented students in the school.  But his scholarship is way too big, he doesn't treat the professors with respect, and he won't come to class if he's got a paper cut. No one wants to be on his mock trial team, even though they'll probably win.  The school tried to sell him to Yale, but they didn't even want him for free.  They said it was the scholarship, but that's not really it.  He just needs a better attitude.   14. The Curt Schilling  He thinks he's the Dean of the Law School.  And one day he probably will be, but for now he's got an opinion about everything, and goes onto all sorts of message boards and writes it.  He's good but he's a 3L now and time is running out for him to make his mark.  He'll do fine, but he wants more than that.  He's hungry, even as a 3L.  He wants a job at Wachtell.  Badly.  15. The Mo Vaughn  He goes to too many law firm receptions and eats all the food he can find.  Yes, I'm scraping the bottom of the barrel here and resorting to fat jokes.  I'm sorry.  Twenty is a lot.  16. The Mike Matheny  He's going to be a professor some day.  He's practically a teacher's assistant as it is.  He never really helps anyone out in class but apparently he goes to office hours and... well, he must be doing something right or he wouldn't still be around.  It seems like he's failing all his classes, but someone must like him... he'll be teaching before we know it.  17. The Joe Mauer  He's not even here yet!  But his reputation precedes him.  The star 1L, everyone's sure he'll make law review, even before seeing his first exam answer.  Expectations are high, no one knows if he'll really be able to live up... but everyone's trying to get in his section, just to see.  18. The Josh Hamilton  He's not here yet either, but probably won't be coming.  Keep hearing about him, but the train keeps getting derailed.  Study guides are the problem now they say.  One-year suspension for using study guides.  Also has 26 Supreme Court opinions tattooed all over his body.  19. The Ramon Castro  He may have raped a fellow student.  Trial soon.  We'll stand clear of this one for a while.  20. The Alex Rodriguez  Superstar.  Once "The Barry Bonds" is gone, it will be even more undisputed than it is now.  Just transferred to the best school around.  Rumors are that he gets his own honor roll, just for him, but we'll see about that.  Not only is he on law review, but he has the hardest position.  Or at least he did until getting to the new school, where he's agreed to go from Editor in Chief to Executive Editor just to spare someone's feelings.  But if they knew what was best they'd keep him as Editor in Chief.  He'll probably be there by next year anyway.  (apologies to girls.  i didn't mean to use "he" as the only pronoun.  girls are just as good as boys at this whole law school thing anyway.  and probably at baseball if they'd sign you.)

       urlLink Howard Bashman  links to  urlLink this AP article  reporting that Sandra Day O'Connor has been chosen as one of 10 "Arrid Total Women of Today" and is pictured on her very own Arrid trading card, which "features a large logo that includes the brand name 'Arrid Total,' described on a fact sheet sent to reporters as an 'all-in-one anti-perspirant and deodorant.' It's available in 'powder' or 'passion flowers' scents."  How odd.  In other Supreme Court Justice news, John Paul Stevens will reportedly be appearing as a guest judge on American Idol next week, Clarence Thomas is featured in an upcoming Playgirl spread, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is the host of Saturday Night Live tonight, David Souter has signed a sponsorship deal with Hooters restaurants (they will all be renamed "Souter's Hooters"), Antonin Scalia plays bass on the new Outkast album, Anthony Kennedy is in a new line of commercials for Crest Whitestrips, Stephen Breyer is starring with Jim Carrey in the sequel to his hit movie "Liar, Liar!" (tentatively titled, "Breyer, Liar!"), and Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream is naming a new flavor after Chief Justice William Rehnquist, ImPEACHment Hearings, peach flavored ice cream with a blueberry ribbon (symbolic of the blue dress).

      This evening I saw the law school's improv comedy group perform along with a group from one of the Harvard undergrad houses.  They weren't bad.  I laughed.  I got my money's worth and more (it was free).  Tuesday night, I've been meaning to report but haven't had a chance yet, I went to see composer Randy Newman do a "conversation with some music" on the undergrad campus -- basically it was like an Inside The Actors Studio kind of thing -- an interviewer asked him questions and occasionally one would spur him to get up and play something on the piano and sing.  And then he took questions from the audience.  I was not hugely familiar with his body of work, but I definitely thought it would be cool to see him talk and sing -- and it really was.  Totally converted me from a non-fan into a moderate-fan; and I thought he came off as an interesting, bright, articulate, passionate person and songwriter.  Who has had a tremendous career I would give my little toe for.  His song from Toy Story 2, "When She Loved Me" (performed by Sarah McLachlan) was very, very nice.  His film music from The Natural was awesome.  Good stuff.  It's all been part of my effort to go see more arts stuff that's on campus -- these two events, the a cappella concert a couple of weeks ago, the Hasty Pudding show... I'm into all of it; definitely trying to take advantage.  And even the non-arts stuff -- Dennis Kucinich, the law and politics panel this past week....  Because that's part of what makes being on a university campus cool -- there's stuff going on.  I don't want to miss seeing interesting and cool things that'll make the day more fun and give me something to think about and talk about and maybe inspire some more creativity in me.  Go see stuff.  It's so worth it.  So much better than movies.  So so so much better than reality TV.  So so so so so much better than doing your reading.  :)

      A bunch of weblogs have linked to  urlLink Open Secrets  in the last few days, a website that lets you look up what political candidates people are donating to.  Among the interesting bits of information I uncovered (scandalous even):  1. George Washington, of Atlanta, GA, gave $250 to Norm Coleman and $500 to Max Cleland. Neither are Federalists. 2. John Adams, of Berkeley, CA, gave $500 to Howard Dean. 3. Thomas Jefferson, of Bloomington, IL, gave $250 to John M. Shimkus, and $500 to Dennis Hastert.  4. James Madison, of Middletown, CT, gave $339 to the Libertarian National Committee, which means his views seem to have changed radically since he wrote the Federalist Papers. 5. James Monroe, of Wicheta, KS (that's how he spelled it) has given almost $2000 to Pat Buchanan.  Clearly no longer supporting the Monroe Doctrine, I say trying to be clever but not even completely sure if that makes any sense, or even if it does if any of my readers will get it. 6. John Q. Adams of Tampa, FL gave $200 to the Republican National Committee.  Again with the party-switching. 7. Andrew Jackson, a student in Mississippi, gave $200 to John Kerry.  Well, they do kind of look alike. 8. Many members of the Van Buren family have given money to Arlen Specter.  None named Martin or with the first initial M. 9. Dr. William H. Harrison of North Carolina gave money to Elizabeth Dole.  Perhaps if President WH Harrison had been a doctor he would have known to put a coat on during his inaugural and wouldn't have gotten sick and died so quickly. 10. John Tyler, a lawyer in Texas, gave money to John Edwards and Hillary Clinton.  President Tyler had 17 children. 11. James K. Polk (even got the middle initial right) of North Carolina gave money to Elizabeth Dole.  She seems to be popular among North Carolinians who share their names with former presidents. 12. Zachary Taylor of Helena, MT gave $1000 to Michael Taylor.  Maybe related?  I guess people are allowed to give money to relatives running for office, right? 13. I guess I'm not really that surprised there are no "Millard Fillmore"s in the donor database. 14. Franklin Pierce of Texas gave money to John Carter.  He's the doctor on ER played by Noah Wyle, right? 15. James Buchanan of Kentucky gave money to Michael Oxley.  No idea. 16. Abe Lincoln of upstate New York gave money to the National Federation of Independent Businesses.  Okay, that's enough.  Interesting, right?

      In the law school a cappella group I'm in, we rehearsed tonight one of the songs we're doing for our spring concert next month, "God Only Knows" (you may know the Beach Boys' version; we're doing the slower Manhattan Transfer version, but the words are the same).  Anyway, I keep on fumbling the lyric and wanting to sing "God's Only Nose" instead of "God Only Knows."  So I figured I could ingrain the flub into my head even better by writing a whole parody lyric for it.  Apologies that I've sunk to lowest common denominator potty humor here.  Hence:  God's Only Nose   It may not smell like flowers If you eat beans and wait two hours Some things smell very badly Cause God lost her nose, so sadly God's only nose, she can't smell without it  The smell of bread in the oven A smell no one can help but lovin' But right when the Earth was forming God lost her nose one morning God's only nose, she can't smell without it  That's why some things smell charming And others more underarm-ing After the nose was finished Her sense of smell diminished God's only nose, she can't smell without it  God's only nose, she can't smell without it

      Yesterday, while in the law school newspaper office trying to match a photo with my  urlLink column this week  about celebrating spring break a few weeks early, we selected a Girls Gone Wild video box cover photo.  Although not completely relevant, it'll look nice in the paper.  It crossed my mind that if I was writing an article about some mysterious epidemic of women getting pregnant over spring break, I'd have the perfect headline:  Girls Gone Child .  Budding journalists should feel free to steal that.

      In my fake Guide to LLM Life -- scroll down  urlLink here -- I said, in jest, that "Harvard" was the Indian word for "Land of the Brilliant But Modest."  I'm inspired to turn that into a whole song.  This one ain't no parody song, but e-mail me if you want the mp3.  I don't know if this works or is just throwaway.    "Land of the Brilliant But Modest"   They're reading books In the cover of darkness Solving equations In the black of the night Submitting papers Under names that have been falsified Saving the world But hiding out  It's the land (land, land) of the brilliant but modest Where the credit's shared, and no one wants fame It's the land (land, land) where they're all deferential And no one cares if you know his name  The trophy sits But there is no engraving Reporters come But no one will talk You ask for help And there's a line of willing geniuses You slip and fall They pick you up  It's the land (land, land) of the brilliant but modest Where the world gets changed, and that's all you want It's the land (land, land) where you don't need the credit It's in your heart; no reason to flaunt  Though it'll go into history You're okay if your name is a mystery Though what you're doing is stunning work You're more than just a cunning jerk Who wants his name in the news  It's the land (land, land) of the brilliant but modest Where the world says thanks, and that's all you ask It's the land (land, land) can somebody point me You, yeah you, the one in the mask.

      I promised I'd post the news article I was writing about the panel Monday evening on combining a career in law and politics.  This is my draft before anyone at the newspaper sees it.  Enjoy.  On Monday evening, the Office of Public Interest Advising presented a panel on combining a passion for politics with a law degree.  Chris Lehane (HLS 94), who worked in the Clinton White House, and then as political consultant for the 2000 Gore presidential campaign, and, most recently, the John Kerry and then Wesley Clark 2004 campaigns, was joined by Don McGahn (general counsel of the National Republican Congressional Committee), Cheryl Cronin (partner at the Boston law firm Brown, Rudnick and counsel to the 2004 Democratic National Convention) and Bobbie Hantz ( former executive director of the New Hampshire Republican Committee) in a discussion about their careers in law and politics and the upcoming election.  Ill spend more time in this session today than I spent in a classroom all three years of law school, said Lehane, who was the only one of the four panelists who has eschewed the law firm life completely and devoted himself full-time to politics.  Lehane grew up in a family active in politics  at age 12 he ran a precinct in Sen. Edward Kennedys bid for the Democratic nomination; between college and law school, he worked for the governor of Maine, and spent much of his time at law school working for the 92 Clinton campaign, [teaching] people from Arkansas how to put lawn signs in the ground in New Hampshire after the first frost.  He went to work in the White House right after graduation from HLS.  McGahn followed a more traditional path to his current job at the NRCC.  Through college and law school, politics was not a passion  in contrast with a classmate he recalled who had been quite excited about the brief presidential candidacy of Sen. Dick Lugar during one election cycle (Id never seen anyone so excited about Dick Lugar)  but after an internship where he witnessed a bitterly contested state election recount, he realized the political life might be for him.  He went to a firm in Washington, DC that did some political work, but was rebuffed in his initial attempts to work with the partners in that area.  Finally, an election law case came up, and he was pulled in based on his internship experience.  That case led to others, and eventually he made a name for himself and moved over to the NRCC.  Cronin has incorporated politics into her career largely on the side  as a partner at a large firm, she has the normal responsibilities that other partners do, and has had to make time for politics.  Her advice is to develop an expertise  in her case, she spent time learning about campaign finance when no one knew how to spell campaign finance and made herself valuable by virtue of her knowledge.  She volunteered to help candidates, something she says few lawyers think of doing, and this helped her network and meet more people who could provide future opportunities.  Hantz spent eight years as a political operative before even going to law school, running field efforts and coordinating events on the ground.  She got burned out by the campaign life and moved to a career in real estate; after four more years she realized this was not her passion, and went to law school.  Now, as an environmental and natural resources attorney, she spends time on the side fundraising and lobbying for Republican candidates.  Lehane discussed how law school gave him a credential that helped him stand out from the pack, even though he had never practiced law.  It conferred legitimacy  in my case, certainly not warranted, he joked.  He found that it opened doors and made people want to talk him, and that even though converting on the opportunities depended entirely on the job he was able to do and work he produced, the law degree did help him get that first step.  The legal education, he said, was helpful when dealing with the press and having to explain legal matters to them, and in analyzing issues.  This benefit was something he did not anticipate or expect, but [has] found to be of value.  Cronin joked that the best thing about law school was that it lasts only three years, but that the education made her realize the limitations of just being a lawyer.  Ultimately, she said, you can create a career for yourself more interesting than law school makes it seem that youve got to figure out a way to do more than this is what you get [from law school].  McGahn emphasized that the best way to move from being just another lawyer to getting involved in politics is developing skills.  If I can do it, anyone can do it, he joked.  Create something that makes you in demand something youre passionate about [nothing is more important than] putting in the hours and learning something.  Lehane suggested working on a campaign  the ultimate meritocracy  rewarding people who can get things done.  The panelists disagreed on the right path for students to take coming out of law school who feel like they may want a career in politics down the line.  Cronin argued that a law firm job, at least for a few years, is definitely the way to go: Take the very best job you can, she said.  Spend three to five years doing that  you may not last much longer than that.  Take time on the side to get involved in political organizations.  For now, youre the hottest commodity you can be  maximize that its too early to compromise yourself.  Lehane disagreed and said that for graduates who know where their hearts lie, it may be worth taking the risk.  You wont have a problem coming out of this place finding a job.  Cronin responded that it is very hard to come out of law school and spend a couple of years outside and then get a big firm to hire you.  The panelists spent some time discussing their thoughts on the 2004 presidential election.  When asked about the influence of Ralph Nader, McGahn joked that the conventional wisdom is anyone to the left of Kerry will vote for Nader: ten people in New York City, and five people in San Francisco.  If you see Kerry in a Democratic state, youll know he has problems, McGahn said.  Its an electoral map strategy, not a popular tally.    Lehane said the key to the election will be the upper Midwest.  His top three picks for Kerrys running mate: Tom Vilsack, Dick Gephardt, John Edwards.  McGahns pick for VP: Dick Cheney.

      Now that the Law School Parody show is over, I feel relatively comfortable posting the lyrics to one of the songs, that got virtually no reaction from the audience, but I enjoyed crafting the parody lyrics for.  I don't know if it was too fast to be understood, or just not very compelling on stage, but this seemed to be the moment of the show when everyone suddenly had to go the bathroom...   "Learning Legalese," to the tune of The Vapors' "Turning Japanese"   My eyes are bleeding, from all this reading I wish the casebooks were not twelve inches thick All this dissenting, is unrelenting I need a study guide -- and I need it quick! It's got me throwing up and laying down and staying in; I'm failing out.  I'm learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really hope so  (learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really hope so) Meeting of the minds, retainer, eminent domain, right of assumpsit  Lawyer-client privlege, discharge, automatic stay, habeas corpus Affidavit, deposition, amicus curiae, jurisidiction!   I'm a beginner, books should be thinner I kicked the tax code and I fractured my toe Although I'm gifted, this can't be lifted I need an outline for this outline -- I know! Must get these books to class, I need my Mom, to help me haul them all around (big fat woman walks on stage -- which never happened in the show... maybe this alone is why the song failed to inspire!?!?!)  I'm learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really hope so  (learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really hope so) Arbitration, breach of contract, fraudulent conveyance, prima facie Prosecution, statutory, stay of execution, sui juris  12-b-6 dismissal, joint and several, three-pronged test, fee simple transfer   No words with less than fourteen letters No teachers speak a language I understand No one told me Latin would be necessary No one told me law school would be quite this scary ...  No one... Thats why  I'm learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really think so, think so, think so  (learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really think so)  Learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really think so  (learning legalese, I think I'm learning legalese, I really think so)

      I've got a new post up at  urlLink De Novo  in response to some law school advice by Slate's Dahlia Lithwick.  I'll whet your appetite:   A classmate recently shared a conversation he had with one of his professors. Think about the biggest risk-takers you knew from college. Are they in law school? Of course not. Law school is the next step for the risk-averse when a college degree isnt enough. Ever since we started school weve been on the express train; weve been building our resumes since seventh grade: take the hardest classes you can find in high school; join as many extracurriculars as you can; start practicing for the SAT; fill out those college applications; choose the right major; keep up your grades; join as many extracurriculars as you can; get the right summer internships; start thinking about grad school do you want to be a doctor, a lawyer, or a rabbi? Well, the first two at least. A friend of mine actually had his parents present those three choices to him: hes now in his fifth year of rabbinical school. Click the link for the rest.

      While googling for something unrelated, I stumbled across a  urlLink website  devoted to assisting Harvard LLM students in their transition to law school here.  There's a  urlLink similar site  for JD students, but this one was apparently an experimental spinoff a few years ago that never quite took off.  Anyway, there's a "Unofficial Guide to LLM Life" on the site that I thought would provide me with all sorts of material for a funny little piece.  But there's really not much there that isn't fairly straightforward and unable to be misinterpreted for comic gold.  The best they've got is this piece on haircuts -- "One random piece of advice relates to haircuts. One LLM complained about the difficulty in finding a good, inexpensive hairdresser in Cambridge, or explaining to them exactly how you?d like your hair styled. One solution is to bring photographs of your hair as you like it to show the hair dresser."  I don't know why I found this amusing, but I did.  But, I figured if this wasn't going to be that funny on its own, I might at least be able to parody it and turn it into something worthwhile.  Hence:   The  Really  Unofficial Guide to LLM Life   Welcome to law school, and, in some cases, to the Northern hemisphere, where you will be startled to find that water runs down the drain in the opposite direction.  Here are some things to know as you begin your time here in the United States.  1.1 The Academic Year  The academic calendar is divided into three semesters: Fall semester, which runs from September to December (although you probably call this "Spring" if you are from somewhere below the equator); Winter semester, which is a three-week period in January (you probably call this "Vacation" if you are from any school but this one); and Spring semester, which runs from February to May, but feels like Winter because this is Massachusetts, which is the Indian word for "Cold and Windy, Ten Months Out of the Year."  Your classmates will also be impressed if you know the translation for the Indian word "Boston," which is "Place of Intolerable Accents."  Or the translation for "Harvard," which is "Land of the Brilliant but Modest."  No, actually that last translation is absurd in how incorrect it is.  But you will endear yourselves to the natives if you tell them that's what you think it means.  They might even stop spitting on you when they pass.  1.2 Courses  You are only here for a year, which means there's a chance, although small, that you may actually find enough interesting classes to fill your schedule, as opposed to the JD students, who end up cross-registering for Portuguese or Modern Yoga in their third year, just to fill out schedules already padded with classes that have no hope of being interesting but at least the professor does not take attendance.  Your course guides will include many classes not offered in this, or any, academic year, only listed because once, in 1892, a professor thought he might offer it one day, but never did.  Note that any class that sounds truly compelling will have filled up long before you get a chance to register, and the ones you are left with, although you may blame the professor's incoherence on your non-native English skills, there'll actually be no one in the room who knows what the heck he's saying.  So don't worry -- even if you failed the TOEFL, you'll still be on equal footing.  1.3  How Much Do Things Cost?  Too much!  Your textbooks will cost approximately $1/page, your classes will cost $1/second, and your breakfast cereal will cost $1/flake.  No, it's not really that bad.  But if you're from a country where things are relatively cheap, plan to spend as much in a day here as you would in a month there, plus tax and gratuity.  Housing will set you back about $2/square foot/month, which is why the law school dorms are just $4/month.  Cafeteria food will seem reasonably priced until you just vomit it all up every afternoon and realize you're not getting good value.  Library fines are exorbitant -- your best bet is probably just to avoid the library at all costs.  1.4 Where Will I Be Living?  Many students live in Harvard Square, under park benches.  This would be more reasonable if it wasn't winter all year long ("Winter All Year Long" is also the name of the school's theme song, which can be found on the upcoming CD, "A Cappella Music For The Hearing Impaired," available from a retailer near you).  Apartments vary in cost from "Are you kidding me?" to "Can I please file for bankrupcty?"  The farther away you live from campus, the cheaper your rent.  Some students choose, therefore, to live in Vermont (where the new theme song, incidentally, is "Thought We'd Finally Get Some National Press By Sending A Man To The White House, But Guess Not," which can be found on the upcoming CD, "Campaign Songs for Campaigns That Never Took Off," also featuring Gary Hart's hit, "The Press Can Keep An Eye On Me -- Oh Wait, No, Oops").  1.5 What Will I Be Eating?  Food as interpreted by Cambridge restaurants will be largely unfamiliar to you, regardless of your country of origin.  Burrito = Egg Roll = Blintz = Cardboard Toilet Paper Roll.  Indistinguishable.  For real ethnic cuisine, you'll have to cook it yourself in the well-appointed dormitory kitchens, which contain a dirty pot, a broken stove, and a wooden mallet.  Just like home!  Don't expect to find anything delicious anywhere; you'll have to subsist on greasy pizza and fragrant potpourri.  1.6 How Will I Get Around?  Rickshaw.  No, not really.  You'll wander the beautiful streets of Cambridge, and get lost among the CVS pharmacies and Fleet Banks, which appear on every corner.  If you bring a car, you're just being silly.  There's nowhere to park, and no one is Boston observes traffic laws.  In addition, the corrupt local government means that no one who runs you over will ever be punished, unless you're Irish.  Sorry.  1.7 What Things Will I Have To Buy?  Prostitutes.  Have you seen your fellow students??  No.  I'm kidding.  That was a cheap joke, and not true at all.  Jokes are the only thing cheap here in Cambridge.  You'll need to buy soap and deodorant, unless you're French.  You'll need to buy a gun, because this is America, and all Americans carry firearms on them at all times.  And you'll need to buy earplugs, unless you enjoy the sound of trucks rolling by outside your window.  1.8 What Is It Like Finding A Job After Graduation?  About the same as it was like before you got here.  Did you really think a year at Harvard was going to open doors for you?  Come on.  Law firms want fresh, young American meat, not someone who comes to this country with well-developed notions of justice and fairness, and a sense that people shouldn't work 100 hours a week to support their greedy, hedonistic lifestyles.  Silly LLMs!  Enjoy your time at law school!

      There's an organization here called the "Student Funding Board" -- basically, they decide how to allocate the school's money toward extracurricular activities, based on budgets presented and presentations made.  Besides just really enjoying the power that I suppose comes with managing the six-figure budget and controlling the fate of your fellow students, I can't imagine why anyone would have interest in being on this board.  If you're on the board, you can't be on the board of any organizations they fund -- meaning that basically you're distributing money to organizations you're not in.  I don't personally care whether the Committee on Sports and Entertainment Law gets $5000 or $7500 next year, and I can't see why there are people who care enough to be on a board that decides it, and read proposals and hear presentations and study budgets... heck, even for the organizations I'm involved in I'm not sure I really care how much money we get.  Whatever you give us we'll spend it, but it's not like my quality of life will change based on whether the a cappella group gets $500 or $1000.  This whole thing just seems silly -- yes, I guess they need to actually have a process to decide how the money gets allocated; and, yes, I guess it's better for students to do it than administrators (although I'm not really sure why -- I haven't thought through this point), but who are these students who are so motivated to devote their time and energy to doing this?  And why??

      I attended the following event tonight:   Attorneys in Politics.  Professor David Barron will moderate this exciting panel of 4 attorneys (2 Republicans and 2 Democrats!) who have combined their passion for politics with their law degrees.  The panelists are Christopher Lehane '94, National Political Consultant for Gore, Kerry and Clark Presidential Campaigns, Don McGahn, General Counsel of the National Republican Congressional Committee, Cheryl Cronin, Brown, Rudnick and Counsel to Boston 2004, Bobbie Hantz, Gottesman & Hollis, Republican Activist and Former Exec. Director of the New Hampshire Republican Committee. I'll have a news article about it in this week's law school newspaper, and post it on here once I've written it.  Basically: it was interesting, but nothing extraordinary, although it is kind of disappointing that, besides Lehane, these are the best three examples of people mixing law with politics that they could find, better than anyone who's an alum... surely there have got to be more graduates from here doing political work that would be willing to come talk... it was a very well moderated panel, incidentally, by a very solid professor I had last semester for Local Government Law.

       urlLink Evan Schaeffer  links to a blog written by law firm partners about their associates.  (Evan suggests that too many links over there will make them realize they're no longer writing in obscurity and they'll stop -- so I'll refrain from a direct link, but googling any of the excerpts I post here should do the trick if you want to read more.  I'm also not completely convinced this isn't all being done in humor and not completely seriously.)  Evan finds the whole thing evil, but I find it pretty thought provoking.  A few excerpts that maybe I'll write some thoughts about later, but for now just the excerpts:   "Please re-write this-- the point we are trying to make seems buried," is apparently heard as an insulting tirade attacking the associate's intelligence, mother, and ethnic background. "Your hours are a little light this month-- perhaps you could come in this Saturday," is heard as a Simon Legree-like threat to break up the associate's family by sending a member down river... Get out of the firm that makes you work harder than you want to. Get out of the practice area that you've just realized is like a trip to the dentist every day you go to work. Get out of law all together, if it's not what suits you. All of us get into this profession because we are fairly bright, and very determined. I'd be the last to say that doggedness isn't a valuable personality trait, but very often I see lawyers who are miserable in their work, and are doing only because they are determined to hang on. That is a terrible way to feel about your profession-- if you hate it, there is no way you can be getting paid enough to keep doing this work, and the sooner you figure that out, the better.  the big firm experience was oddly lonely much of the time. Nobody talked much about what they were doing-- except to complain-- because nobody wanted to give anybody else a leg up. You never wanted to go to someone with a question, because to do so might suggest weakness, and put you behind in the race for the prize. Once a year some were chosen to become partners, and some were not. The ones who were not were damaged goods-- like crippled beggars that you tried not to look at. For all the talk of the place being "like a family" what it was really like was a pack of wolves. The cripples were culled from the pack pretty ruthlessly, and you tried not look when it was happening.  Thinking about it, one of the reasons we have never made the same mistake with an associate twice is the endless variety of associates that are out there. Each has a fatal personality flaw; typically it is exactly that flaw that we focus on and base our hiring decision on. This one places family life above all; we decide that he will be highly motivated and are surprised when his mornings are consumed with pediatric appointments and school plays. Another is single, but spends her time searching for the person that will make her life complete, rather than billing. One is smart-- and second guesses everything we try to tell her. Another is hard working, but lacks the confidence in his own judgment to do anything without first being reassured repeatedly that it is what needs to be done.

      I'm heading to sleep early tonight, because after a week of performing in the Parody show, I'm pretty exhausted, and my 8:30 Corporations class beckons too soon.  But starting at midnight, if all goes as planned, I'd like to invite you to head over to  urlLink De Novo , a new group blog effort I'm part of that's basically the successor to  urlLink En Banc .  (Incidentally,  urlLink Unlearned Hand , who started En Banc, has a thoughtful and engaging post up today a bit about why he ended En Banc, and a bit about the plight of finding a life of purpose while at law school.  I identify with a good bit of what he says.)  In any case, when En Banc ended, I wasn't sure if I wanted to be part of whatever incarnation it next took -- I wasn't sure that I'd really figured out what the group blog format provided that I wasn't getting out of posting here, besides some new readers (of course, new readers are great, and so it was surely worth it just for that), but as we started talking about a possible new blog, we realized that what's cool about the group blog format is that it can bring diverse voices together under one roof, and, especially by including a comments function for readers to react, create a little bit of a conversation.  We've decided to experiment with the idea of a "symposium" -- we invited some of our favorite legal bloggers -- professors and practitioners -- to contribute pieces regarding their perspectives on legal education, a topic we thought would be of interest to most of our potential readers.  What's cool about the legal blogosphere is that there are students, there are professors, and there are practitioners -- who in "real life" probably wouldn't have the opportunity to engage in too many conversations on relatively equal footing, yet we link to each other, we respond to each other's posts, there's a dialogue already across lots of legal weblogs.  We're hoping that our symposium can organize and foster even more dialogue, and bring a bunch of people's thoughts together and begin what could end up being an interesting conversation.  This might be a failed experiment.  It just may not spark that much interest.  That's fair.  I don't know if people really care to read a bunch of essays about the value of legal education, and whether what we've put together really will start a conversation or just pass in the night unnoticed, like some of my less successful attempts to be funny.  But we thought it was worth a shot, and maybe we've stumbled onto something that has a waiting audience.  Maybe not.  It's cool either way.  In any event,  urlLink check it out .  Of course, like I keep saying, nothing changes here.  Unless you want it to, in which case you know where to reach me.  I have a song parody burning a hole in my chest but I really want to get to sleep, so it'll have to wait until tomorrow.  :)

      The lobby of my building offered free refrigerator magnets tonight, advertising "Yellow Cleaning Services."  Who in the world decided that was a good name for a cleaning service??  When I think of things that are yellow, I don't think of clean things.  I suppose it's better than "Brown Cleaning Services" -- or, perhaps the worst of the possibilities, "Brown and Yellow Cleaning Services" (or "Yellow and Brown Cleaning Services), but what about "Sparkling White Cleaning Services," or "Disinfected Cleaning Services," "Fresh Smell Cleaning Services," "Brighter Day Cleaning Services," or, if they really want people's attention, "Naked Lady Cleaning Services," "Money Back Guaranteed Cleaning Services," or, in the tradition of e-mail spam, "Enlarge Your [whatever] Cleaning Services."

       Spring Break Early!   From talking to some of my friends at other law schools, it seems like this week is a popular one for Spring Break.  And yet I've still got two more weeks here in Cambridge, two more weeks to wait before my fellow students can fly down to Florida, spend a week on a beach in Mexico, snorkel in the blue waters of  I have no idea where people snorkel, sorry go home and see some family and friends, or catch up on Corporations reading (fun!).  Nevertheless, there are advantages to having to wait two more weeks for spring break  first, it will actually be spring (and so the ground  outside chance  might not be covered in snow); and second, it will mean fewer weeks after break until the year is over and we can enjoy our summers working for law firms yeah, that doesnt sound quite right.  But for people who, like me, don't have spring break yet, but who really just cant wait, Ive come up with a few ideas on how to celebrate Spring Break early, while were still at school:  1. Wardrobe.  Just because youre not surfing off the San Diego coast doesnt mean you cant show up in Tax class dressed like you are.  Bathing suits, tank tops, bikinis, flip-flops.  So what if theres ice on the ground and a chill in the air?  Its Spring Break wherever you are!  2. Atmosphere.  Print out your case briefs on fancy paper with a festive Spring Break border of streamers and balloons; beads and beer cans; police officers and handcuffs.  Edit your journal articles to include the words dude, beach party, sneak across the border in a rental car, and doing lines of coke in the back of an abandoned warehouse in Miami-Dade County with the guys who ran the 2000 election recount.  I dont know where that sentence came from.  I dont mean to insinuate the people who counted hanging chads were doing coke, or that they are in fact still doing coke, with law students, over Spring Break, in the back of abandoned warehouses.  But, as you can see, inspiration is not coming easy this evening, so youll have to bear with me.  3. Schedule.  Class at 10?  Ten at night perhaps.  Convince your professors to move your 8:30 AM classes to midnight, and replace the fluorescent classroom lights with a disco ball, the blackboard with black-light, and the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act with the latest trashy romance novel.  And your midterm writing exercise with a beach party.  4. Relaxation.  Here at Harvard, we can convert our Dean-built ice rink to a beach.  Right now it's a puddle of mud.  How about we turn that mud into sand and enjoy sunbathing with a good book written by Glannon under the warm sun provided by the halogen lamps they dont allow in the dorms.  Maybe the Dean can use some of the student happiness fund to turn our free coffee and tea into free margaritas and daiquiris.  Stick paper umbrellas in your Nantucket Nectars.  Eat cafeteria food and feel like youre in Mexico, experiencing the ravages of explosive diarrhea.  5. Recreation.  Instead of swimming with the sharks in Ecuador (again, Im not sure if people really swim with sharks, and if they do swim with sharks, Im not sure if they do that in Ecuador), swim with the gunners in the gym.  Instead of volleyball on the sand, try Ultimate Frisbee on the ice.  Instead of tennis at the resort, try throwing your casebooks into a big bonfire and using it to roast marshmallows.  I know thats not really a sport.  But it might be fun anyway.  6. Economics.  Your suggestions are great, the easily amused portion of you are thinking, but Spring Break is pretty expensive, and staying at school wont feel like Spring Break since I wont be spending hundreds of dollars on airfare, hotel rooms, and strip clubs.  Ah, but at law school, I respond, youre wasting money just as prodigiously.  On classes, which, by my rudimentary calculations, cost 159,000 Italian lire per hour.  So it may be weeks until Spring Break.  But why wait?

      The law school parody show finished its run last night.  To the two Yale Law students who came up to me after the show and said they read this and like it: thanks -- you made my day.  To any of my fellow cast members who happen to read this: awesome job -- working on the show was an awful lot of fun, and I think we had an enormously talented cast and crew, and, more important, a cast and crew made up of awesome, cool, good people.  I will miss spending the bulk of my 6:00-midnight hours standing in a dark corner, waiting for a light cue.  Well, maybe not.  To the random unidentified e-mailer who wrote at 6:55 last night inquiring about what time the Parody starts (7:00): sorry -- hope you figured it out.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  responds to my posts below about the law firm partner who posted on the Princeton Review board about work vs. life at a big firm.  WT writes:   My sense is that if something about the law firm life gives you a real kick, then the appalling hours are probably tolerable. The pleasure might come from being part of a piece of litigation, or knowing that you're part of a deal that makes people money, or that you're competing against other smart, hard working people, but you need to really enjoy some part of the whole thing. Unlike many others, though, I do believe practicing law can be a calling, something people are really meant to do. I don't think I disagree.  If this stuff is your passion -- and you want to be there, and you enjoy the work, for whatever reason (although "knowing that you're part of a deal that makes people money" strikes me as a fairly appalling reason, but that may just be me), then of course it's a great job.  That's the goal, isn't it -- to find the job that feels like a calling (at best), or (at worst) at least feels somewhat pleasurable to do every day.    But even if you love the job -- the partner on the Princeton Review board was answering a question where someone asked if one day a week he'd be able to go do a family thing at 6:30 at night.  And his answer was a pretty unambiguous "not if you want to succeed here."  It just strikes me that you need more than a "real kick" out of the work to truly be happy when it's the only thing you can really do with yourself.  I get a real kick out of writing stuff.  If you chained me to my computer and told me I had to write 18 hours a day, I don't think I'd get a real kick out of it anymore.  And I say this, obviously, as a completely uninformed outsider.  I've never worked at a firm; I don't know if it really is impossible to have some sort of balance in your life or not; I don't know if maybe the work is rewarding enough to overcome the hours -- maybe it really is; I can't possibly know yet.  All I do know is that one of my biggest fears is waking up one morning and hating the life I'm leading, regretting the choices I've made, and having no clear way out from where I've ended up.  So quotes like the one on the Princeton Review board scare me, just a little.  UPDATE: Chris at  urlLink cogitation  responds too, from the perspective of someone who worked long hours at a big consulting firm.

      I know I've parodied this song before, but the syllables fit so well, and there are no better choices I can think of... this one's inspired by tax class today.   "Depreciation" to the tune of "Locomotion"   Everybody's paying a lot less tax now Come on filer, do depreciation We're all reducing basis at a speed too fast now Come on filer, do depreciation Some more acceleration so we're getting a break  Less income for the IRS to come in and take So come on, come on, do depreciation with me.  We used to match that cost but, Come on filer, the rules, have changed. Allowed deductions rearranged  Straight line depreciation was the rule for years now, Come on filer, do depreciation But A.C.R.S. numbers give you more to save now, Come on filer, do depreciation We'll shorten all the schedules and increase the rate Erase the salvage value and it all will be great So come on, come on, do depreciation with me.

      Scheherazade at  urlLink Stay of Execution  responds to my post below about one partner's thoughts on work-life balance at a big law firm.  She relates a conversation from when she spent a summer as an associate at a big firm:   The junior partner I was talking to said, "Well, work doesn't have to be your whole life. If you've got something -- maybe you want to tuck your kids in at night, or maybe you play the violin and you want to keep practicing it once a week, or maybe you get up early to swim -- and you are very careful and disciplined, you can make room to keep doing that one thing you're passionate about. You have to make accomodations to do it-- get up early, bring work home -- and nobody says it is easy, but you really can do it if you are committed. But you only get one thing."   I thought a lot about that conversation. I thought -- this work is pretty interesting, I like doing it. But is this work, plus only ONE THING in my outside life, interesting enough to keep me stimulated and happy and balanced, the kind of person I want to be? Coincidentally enough, I had a similar conversation with a partner at one of my callback interviews.  He was saying how the firm really likes its associates to keep a balance in their lives -- I believe his language was something in the vicinity of, "we tolerate, and even encourage our lawyers to keep something in their lives outside of work, whether that's going to the gym for an hour every morning, or playing in a pickup basketball game once a month, or occasionally reading a book for pleasure.  It's definitely good to have something you do outside of the office, and makes you a more interesting and well-rounded person inside the office too."  I mean, the sentiment was nice, his intentions good -- but his examples of interests outside the office just seemed so small and insignificant -- "occasionally reading a book" -- that it undercut the point he was trying to make, and made me very, very frightened.

      There's a  urlLink thread on the Princeton Review law school discussion board  -- which is usually not a particularly helpful source of information, but occasionally lets me know whether people have gotten their grades in the mail yet, or similar stuff like that -- where a corporate litigator at an unnamed New York firm is taking questions.  Or someone is pretending to be a corporate litigator -- I assume it's for real, but who knows.  Anyway, I thought this Q&A was worth sharing, without comment -- this is just this one guy's answer, of course, and I'm sure perspectives vary, among firms and among partners at firms, but it was interesting enough to me, just to hear what appears to be one person's honest perspective, that I thought I'd cut and paste:   Assume an associate wanted to leave by 6:30 one weekday evening each week for a scheduled family event. How flexible would the firm be... ?   It takes a very special person to successfully balance being a young associate here, on the partnership track, and also be a good partner at home and a good parent. I have seen it done and I am seeing it done and it is rare. Very rare. Usually, something gives and that something is the relationship or the work. I do not know for sure but I have my intuit as to how well the parenting holds up, too, and my opinion is that the children suffer, as well. Personally, I didn't have a successful long term relationship until I was a senior associate. If you want to say I sold my soul for this life, I will argue some with you but I do acknowledge that there were huge holes because of the course I chose. Because I was truly committed to my career, the women I dated "made way" for me, my Saturday nights at the office, my breaking of dates due to meetings and last minute motions, etc., if they wanted to go out with me. Thankfully, I had no kids at that age as I sure I would have ignored them, too. It is "a good thing", to borrow our new felon's phrase, that I didn't fall in love, marry and started having children until I was a senior associate and partnership was within reach.... No, leaving one weeknight a week at 6:30 won't get it done here. First, there will be plenty of times when you will have to stay well past that hour and I don't want to hear that you have to go home because it is the usual "mommy" or "daddy" time. Neither will the clients, who are paying substantial money to have the best lawyers work 24/7/365 and a quarter for them. This life isn't for everyone.... Second, the other associates will just bloody crucify you. For example, I have found that the female associates in our group - and they are wonderful, tough lawyers - really give it to the women lawyers who have to leave early for hubby or the children. For several reasons, I have had some heart-to-hearts with some of the more vociferous objectors and they tell me that every time a women in my group doesnt't pull her full weight, it reflects on all women and they can't have that, since they have worked, are working and will work too hard for anyone to hold them back or diminish them because of their sex. My associates are carnivours and they will devour anyone on our team who will not deliver and who will not work as long and as hard and as well as they. And on that note, and entirely coincidentally, I have a 6:30 meeting to attend and there isn't anyone who won't be there because they have to be home.

       Top 10 Reasons Why 1Ls Choose To Do The Law Review Competition   10. Fifty extra hours a week they really want to spend checking footnotes. 9. Punishing themselves for past sins. 8. Do not believe the hiring statistics from the past hundred-odd years that overwhelmingly indicate they'll get great jobs regardless. 7. Have friends on the law review; miss seeing them. 6. Mostly just curious to see if they'll make it; haven't thought through the consequences. 5. Sleeping has stopped being fun. 4. Got confused: thought law review was the name of an intramural softball team. 3. Empty space on resume; "law review" exactly the right number of letters. 2. Want the chance to publish own written work while still a student; forgot that means they have to write something. 1. Really want to be a law professor at Harvard, and nowhere else will do.

      Gotta admit, I'm not big on inspiration the last few days -- performing each night is sort of taking the bulk of my mindshare and I'm just not getting many ideas.  So anyone with a question about law school, or something you want to know about me, or want me to write about, feel free to  urlLink shoot something my way .  Except spam.  Please don't shoot spam my way.  Or spitballs.  None of those.  Been getting an awful lot of those weird Nigerian "help me with my bank account" spam e-mails.  Like I've landed on some bank-friendly mailing list or something.  Maybe some crazy Nigerian banker is actually reading my weblog and has added me to his spam list.  I don't know.  Maybe all of the body-part-enlargement and second-mortgage-loan people have given up their trades and switched to the Nigerian bank account business.  Maybe if I put all of my money in a Nigerian bank account, the conversion rate will be such that it will seem like I have more than twenty-seven cents (four hundred pesos!  wow!).  Maybe if I hide my summer salary in a Nigerian bank account I'll qualify for more financial aid.  Show went well tonight.  Rumor has it my Tax professor was there.  I didn't see her, but other people did.  Maybe she'll talk about it in class tomorrow.  Maybe she'll talk about whether we should have charged tax on the tickets.  I hope not.  That would be horribly boring.  Maybe she'll give out more candy, like she's been doing the past few days to encourage us to participate.  She seems like an awfully nice person.  Despite the fact that she teaches Tax Law.

      Opening night of the show went well, although one of the roles I play was usurped by a professor who wanted to do a cameo and play himself.  I won't name the professor I play, but I will say his last name rhymes with Mershowitz.  Obviously, he got a lot more audience reaction than I would have, so it was good for the show -- and he's apparently leaving the country today, so for the next four nights I get my role back.  :)

      For anyone on the Harvard campus... check out the law school parody show, opening tonight and running through Saturday.  I was one of eight writers; after all the meetings and read-throughs and revisions, I'm not even sure I know for certain which lines were mine and which weren't, not that it matters.  It's a solid show.  It's a two-hour musical comedy poking fun at law school life, students, and professors -- with some cool cameos by professors and some nice singing and dancing.  Better than a movie, and only slightly more expensive.  I have a relatively small amount of stuff to do -- it's a big cast; 50 people I think, so most of us really don't have all that much to do -- but there's still all sorts of potential for me to flub one of my four lines, or forget to carry the table offstage that I'm supposed to help move, or get tangled in the curtain.  UPDATE: Looks like  urlLink Mike over at Wings and Vodka  just survived his school's parody show.  I have a hunch that the {law student / writes a weblog / performs in parody show} club is not much larger than the two of us.  Perhaps someone will tell me I'm wrong.

       urlLink Slate  has an occasional series, "We Read The Book, So You Don't Have To."  Its latest piece is on the new  urlLink Jayson Blair book , which apparently has very little content.  At the very real risk of this being completely devoid of humor, I have a desperate urge to parody their feature by pointing out the highlights of a Chinese take-out menu that was recently slipped under my door.  To be honest, I want to hate Slate's feature because it feels like cheating -- why should you get the rewards without reading the book??  But it saves me from even being curious enough to leaf through the pages in Barnes & Noble, so I can't really be too upset at them.  In any event:   "I Read A Chinese Food Menu, So You Don't Have To"   Panel 1: "Delivery available after 5:00 p.m."  What if I want dinner at 4:30?  This is just another example of corporate greed.  Panel 3: A long and tedious description of the "Triple Delight in a Nest."  Only true Chinese food devotees will need such detail.  You can skip this part without much concern, unless you're allergic to shellfish, in which case you may want to pay close attention.  Panel 4: "Doubled friend pork."  Someone needs a proofreader.  I think they may have rushed to get this menu released to compete with the new Papa John's 2-for-1 special.  There's no editor credited on the back panel -- and mistakes like these make it easy to see why.  Panel 6: "Luncheon menu -- served 11:30 am to 3 pm, Mon. to Fri. except holidays."  Which holidays?  American holidays?  Chinese holidays?  Ambiguities like these take away from the pleasure of menu-reading.  They leave the reader in a state of confusion and hopelessness, wondering what it all means, and whether you've wasted the day reading carefully the luncheon specials, only to discover today's Boxing Day and they're not available.  Frustration.  Panel 7: Finally, the juicy stuff.  Like Peking Duck.  But for all of the description lavished on simple dishes like "pork wonton" we get nothing for the duck.  Someone didn't see the forest for the bamboo shoots here.  The emphasis is in the wrong place.  People want to read about the duck, not the appetizers.  I certainly hope the next menu in the series addresses some of these deficiencies.  Panel 8: "Not responsible for lost articles."  Lost articles of what?  Newspaper articles?  Again, the writing is muddled, the meaning not clear.  Can I not bring a magazine into the restaurant?  Plus, this is a take-out menu -- where will I be leaving my articles, if they're delivering the food to my house?  These logical inconsistencies mar an otherwise very readable manuscript.  Overall, there were few surprises. Perhaps the Hunan Scallops, an unusual concotion.  But for the most part, this is as expected.  A disappointment in what was perhaps the most hotly-anticipated Chinese Food Menu of the season.

       craigslist.org/lawschool/missedconnections   M4W -- Pretty blond asleep at your laptop in the reference room, Contracts treatise open on your desk.  Can I be your study buddy?  W4M -- You were ten minutes late to Con Law.  I grabbed an outline for you.  You looked sexy when you raised your hand.  I was hoping to get a peek at your notes and see what I missed when I went to the bathroom, but your laptop was turned a little too much to the left.  Maybe during the ten-minute break tomorrow you can explain rational basis review to me?  W4MMW -- Looking for some moot court action.  Any teams of three need a fourth?  I'm versatile.  W4M -- You were standing in front of me on line at the counseling center.  I was the one with the cuts on my wrists; you had the empty pill bottle and the vacant look in your eyes.  I think you're cute.  T4TTT -- Saw the three of you studying Torts in the student center at 6AM Wednesday.  Hoping I can join your study group.  I got a B+ in Property last semester.  And already have half an outline.  M4W -- I keep seeing you at the career services orientations.  Baggy sweatshirt, no makeup, dark circles under your eyes.  Are you as confused as I am about this whole process?  I'd love to trade resumes sometime and get your feedback.  P4S -- You sit in the second row of my evidence class.  I haven't called on you yet.  You make me nervous.  You have really pretty eyes.  My wife's out of town next weekend.  Any interest in "office hours" ??  M4M -- Never taken a practice exam with another guy before, but I'm curious how it would feel.  Drug/disease free.  C4C -- I saw you mailing your clerkship applications the other day, at the post office.  I was the guy with the box full of envelopes.  I'd love to know what judges you've heard back from.  I'm still waiting for my first interview.  Hope you're doing better.  I hear the third circuit is hot this year.  I think you're hot too.  W4MMM -- Looking for a bunch of cute guys to tie me to a chair and quiz me with flash cards for the Bar Exam.  Nothing too kinky, just the multi-state section.  S4P -- I sit in the second row of your evidence class.  You haven't called on me yet.  Maybe your wife'll be out of town soon and we can have some "office hours."  I have a "paper topic" I'd like to "talk" to you about.  It involves "a recent tax court decision" about "deductions" and I was hoping you could "point me to some introductory reading material" so that I can "write up an outline."  M4W -- Saw you crying in the cafeteria.  I cry too sometimes.  Maybe we can cry together.  I'm part of a support group where we all get together and cry every once in a while.  It's fun.

      Evan Schaeffer at Legal Underground has an  urlLink amusing, although sort of disturbing post  about what he thinks  urlLink Howard Bashman 's day looks like:   7. Admire tagline of How Appealing: Webs first blog devoted to appellate litigation.  8. Consider tinkering with tagline just a bit; briefly consider a change to webs first blog; scratch idea when you realize someone would discover this exaggeration, which could damage your credibility and make people question your other lesser exaggerations about your blog.  9. Think some more about term appellate litigation in your tagline; remind yourself again as you do every day that appellate litigation is very important--in fact, its how new law is made. I'll know I've hit the big time when someone parodies me.  Please don't take that as an invitation.  I'm sensitive.  Incidentally, Mr. Bashman's latest installment of  urlLink 20 Questions , this time featuring Judge Bruce M. Selya of the First Circuit is pretty interesting -- Selya's very articulate and readable.  Check it out.

      I just posted this over at  urlLink Crescat .  I feel like it doesn't break any new ground, but might be amusing anyway.  Why I just spent twenty minutes surfing MarthaStewart.com instead of doing real work, I'm not quite sure.  I have not found any evidence that Martha Stewart plans to keep a weblog from prison.  But if I did, here's what I might think it would look like on a typical day:   7:13 AM:  After an unpleasant night's sleep that would have benefitted from  urlLink a buckwheat pillow like this one I discovered on my trip to Japan , we were served breakfast on paper plates.  Paper plates!  I miss my  urlLink yellowware .   9:27 AM:  My cellmate got "married" today to the woman in the next cellblock that she has grown quite fond of over the past few weeks.  We held an informal wedding in the library.  I wish I could have given out  urlLink personalized favor boxes  to all of our friends, but instead I just wept silently and thought of  urlLink memories from home , from a life before the Big House.   12:14 PM:  The bread is fresh today.  For that I am certainly thankful.  But how I wish I had some Gruyere cheese and grainy mustard, and access to an oven, so that I could make  urlLink this inventive bread and cheese meal .   2:29 PM:  My shoes got dirty in the garden.  Too bad  urlLink boots  aren't allowed.  Also, Sandra threatened to bury me alive if I didn't stop correcting the way she was  urlLink rolling the hose  back onto the hook.  She said she would "roll  my  hose."  I don't know what she meant by that.   5:15 PM:  Sunset. My favorite time of day.  At least today they didn't  urlLink beat me with a rake .   7:36 PM:  Two things you "must-have" in prison -- (1) a  urlLink springform pan  for savory and sweet cakes and tarts using fresh ingredients from the garden, and (2) some  urlLink striped fabric  to match my jumpsuit, and make all of my accessories fit right in.     8:50 PM:  Dinner is late tonight.  I entertained myself in the meantime by making  urlLink bunny ears .  I found a rotten banana by the dumpster.  I thought of  urlLink this recipe .  I won't be eating that anytime soon.  I ate the banana.  Then Sandra  urlLink beat me with a rake .  And the day had been going so well.  I soaked my jumpsuit in cold salt water to try and  urlLink get out the blood stains .  It seems to be working.   11:02 PM:  Time for bed. I hope I dream about  urlLink baby booties  again.  That's such a pleasant dream.  More from me tomorrow.  I'm Martha Stewart.  And this is jail.

       Extracurricular Elections Time   Like the People's Choice Awards marks the start of a long and grueling awards season that culminates with the Oscars, the recent election for law review president indicates the start of the extracurricular election season, where 2Ls and 3Ls who promised to radically transform their respective organizations but, handicapped by the lack of collective energy and the institutional inertia of continuing to do things the way they've always been done, effected very little actual change, will step aside to let bright and eager 1Ls and 2Ls promise the moon and deliver an ice rink.  Or so the analogy goes.  I thought I'd offer a preview of some of the speeches I plan to give, as I embark on a quest to be an officer in every student organization on campus.  I'm seeking the unlimited power to fill out reimbursement forms and stuff mailboxes with tiny scraps of paper.   President, Prison Legal Assistance Project (PLAP)   Good afternoon, my fellow students who did not get into the Legal Aid Bureau.  This organization needs radical change.  Without this change, we will all graduate with nothing to show for our work with PLAP besides the knowledge that we may have helped some people with truly nowhere else to turn and given them the only hope they'll ever have.  But we won't have made any useful connections.  Butch in cellblock C will never be able to help me get a job.  Sandra in the women's correctional facility will never be a hiring partner at Cravath.  Michael in the child sex crimes division will never again release a hit single.  We need to shift our focus in order to maximize our rewards.  We need to limit our services to white-collar crimes with white-collar prisoners - law firm partners who screwed up, but will one day soon be out of prison and hiring eager young Harvard associates; doctors who may have lost their license once, but when they get it back will have lines of patients looking for lawyers to handle their malpractice cases - at 40% commission; and Martha Stewart, who will live to hire again.  I want to usher in a whole new era to the Prison Legal Assistance Project: the Shamelessly Begging For Future Jobs era.  And we need a new acronym, since PLAP sounds kind of dirty.  To effect these changes, I ask for your support.   Vice President, Mediation Program   I apologize in advance for the tone of my speech tonight. And I apologize for the negative tone of the flyers I've been posting all around campus, calling my opponent names and photoshopping him into pictures with Hitler, Stalin, and Martha Stewart.  Many of you have suggested that the two of us run together, on a split ticket, and share the Vice Presidency.  But, friends, this is not a time for compromise.  This is not a time to be working together for greater harmony and peace in the world.  This is a time to stand up and fight; to stand up and say that the Mediation Program can be the best student organization at the law school, and that nothing can stand in our way.  Under my leadership, we will book classrooms for events, even if we have nothing planned - just to stifle the efforts of our competitors to find rooms.  We will tear down the posters of other groups.  We will trip people in the halls.  We will steal their funding.  We will bribe their members with free food.  We will stop at nothing to prevent this place from being just another campus where a multitude of student organizations, each appealing to a constituency with different interests and desires, can co-exist peacefully.  Who wants to live in a world like that?  I appreciate your support, but I have arranged to fix the election regardless.  Thank you.   Treasurer, Student Animal Legal Defense Fund   Good evening, animals, vegetables, and minerals.  I ask for your support in helping me improve the financial stability of our organization.  My plan is simple.  I think we should get corporate sponsorship from the country's largest meatpacking plants.  Mind you, we don't have to actually eat any meat, but if we just distribute brochures featuring happy animals sleeping between two buns next to our brochures about the evils of the slaughterhouse, I'm sure that Purdue and McDonalds, and the friendly people at Monsanto, will be happy to provide us with more money for soy milk.  I also think that instead of t-shirts, this year we should distribute fur hats.  Vote for me!   Secretary, Middle East Law Students Association   I realize we've gone many years limiting our membership to people concerned with issues in the Middle East.  But I think we've ignored two very important potential constituencies.  First, there are the people in the Middle West.  While it may seem that we have little in common with people from Cleveland, I think embracing the industrial factory culture of the Middle West can infuse new life into our club.  Imagine engaging discussions about the migration of jobs from the rust belt to the coasts, or a symposium about corn.  I think it could be marvelous.  Second, there are people from Middle Earth, like the Hobbits.  I think we're doing the law school a disservice by excluding them from our club.  I look forward to your votes.

       Course Selection   We select courses here in one fell swoop for the whole year -- fall, winter, and spring, all together, during the previous spring.  The reason they do that is because some popular 2L/3L classes (Constitutional Law, Corporations, Evidence, etc) have options in the fall and in the spring, and if we didn't register all at once then you'd have to end up taking a chance on whether you'd get something better in the spring than in the fall if you want to take one of those classes, and it would end up being kind of a pain.  Although the current system has its downsides, like who can imagine what they'll want to be taking a year from now.  In any event, they sent us an e-mail asking us to take a short (very short -- one yes/no question) survey about whether we like the current policy.  I'm trying to be more informative and interesting here than funny.  Just thought I'd post some selected pieces of the e-mail:   Re:  Course Registration Procedures Poll  ...The question for further consideration is whether the General Lottery should [ ] remain as a year-long lottery, or whether there should be two General Lotteries, one in the spring for the following fall and winter, and the second in the fall, before Thanksgiving, to cover the following spring.  In our view, there are three principal reasons for considering changing to the two-General-Lottery system.  First, some students find that their interests change as a result of their summer experiences.  While new interests can be accommodated through the present drop/add system, a chance to register for the spring semester from the ground up might better fit new interests, and give students a better chance of getting into popular courses they now discover they want to take.  Second, the same point can be made about new interests that develop during fall term course work.  Finally, and more generally, it requires a fair amount of foresight to choose courses in April that will meet one's requirements starting the following February....  But the Committee also sees some advantages to the present system.  First, for students who do know in April what is of special interest to them, year-long selection allows them to be sure from the beginning of the year that they can count on a place in a course which is of special significance to them - for instance, a place in a spring semester seminar on a subject about which they wish to write a third-year paper.  Second, even in the General Lottery there are many courses that are often offered both fall and spring (perhaps even fall, winter and spring) such as administrative law, evidence, federal courts, secured transactions, and securities regulation. Semester-by-semester choosing will sometimes put students in a hard spot: uncertain as to whether to wait until the lottery for the spring to try to take a course they may not get, when they could have taken a different section of the course in the fall. Third, by distributing lottery selections over a whole years' courses, the present system makes each student's very first choice (or two) for the year more likely to be satisfied.  Finally, although April is a long way from the following February, it is for many students a less hectic time than late October or early November, when concerns about job interviewing may make it harder to focus on selecting courses.  As you can see, the question is one of weighing advantages and disadvantages.  We would like your advice on which case is stronger.  It only takes a couple of clicks. I voted to keep the system as is, because I thought the disadvantages of splitting it up outweighted the advantages -- I don't mind picking in advance and like the security of knowing what I have and not having to take risks on courses offered both semesters.  But it's interesting that they're soliciting our input.  Appreciated, I think.  Cool.  Nothing much funny to say about this stuff, unfortunately.

      I saw the  urlLink Harvard Din & Tonics , an undergrad a cappella group, perform tonight on campus for their 25th anniversary.  They were very, very good.  They made my law school group sound like... well... law students.  But I hear they practice 6 hours a day, and we practice... well... 6 hours a month, lately.  So they ought to sound better than us.  And they sure do.  Basically flawless performances; some really great voices.

       urlLink Howard Bashman  flags  urlLink this NY Times interview with Chief Justice Rehnquist  about his new book on the 1876 election (when he was just a boy...).  Two exchanges worth flagging (questioner in italics, Rehnquist not):    There is a forthcoming review in The Nation by Eric Foner, a professor at Columbia University.   He's a recognized historian. What praise!! I think he went a little overboard there.  A  recognized  historian.  We should all aspire to receive such lofty compliments on our work.    What is your next book going to be?   I don't know there is going to be a next book. I think maybe some sort of a cartoon history of the court. That has been done, but it's not been done with a very good text. I've always enjoyed cartoons. That's one of the things I would like to have been able to do, I would like to have the ability to draw.   I thought you meant draw them yourself.   No! No, it would be a terrible flop. A cartoon history of the court?  That's actually kind of interesting.  I read a cartoon history of the assassination of President Garfield that was quite good.  I'd read one about the Supreme Court, with text by Rehnquist.  Can't imagine all that much to illustrate though.  They sit on a bench and listen to stuff.  I guess you could illustrate the cases.  Some of them.   Roe v. Wade  could have a lovely illustration.   Bowers v. Hardwick .  The recent affirmative action cases (a sea of white people standing in front of an academic building?).  But some, I don't know.   Marbury v. Madison  -- how do you illustrate judicial review?  Could illustrate  Bush v. Gore  by showing that guy peering through the hanging chad.  That image needs to be brough back into circulation.  Interesting task for a cartoonist.  Heck, if I were a cartoonist, I'd be trying to get a hold of Rehnquist right about now.  But I can't draw.  Oh well.  Lost opportunity.

      Selections from the online Harvard Law School calendar of events, with very brief and generally useless commentary:   TODAY: The Harvard Women's Law Journal is pleased to announce its annual conference on "Emotion and the Law." Scholars from around the country will discuss how emotion impacts the practice and theory of the law with panel topics including: "Therapeutic Jurisprudence;" "Emotions and the Legal Practice;" "The Social Construction of Love & Care: Sexual Orientation and Family Law;" and "The Social Regulation of Emotion: Hate, Lust, Anger & Passion." My Torts professor cried in class once.  Does that count?   TONIGHT: Transmission: Not Your Typical Drag King Show.  The Country Kings, a popular thirteen-member North Carolina-based drag king troupe, invite you to an evening of hot, political, fun-filled entertainment as they take their best-of show on the road. I don't know what a Drag King is -- but I'm assuming it would be the opposite of a draq queen, or Women dressing up as Men -- which seems less scandalous, I suppose, than the other way around.  I suppose.   TUESDAY: Talmud Class: Adverse Possession Then and Now.  Come see how the sages of the Talmud dealt with everyones favorite subject from property classadverse possession. All sources will be provided in English. I'm glad all sources will be provided in English. Not that I'm going.   NEXT WEEK: HLS Spring Blood Drive.  Walk-ins are welcome. Located in the Ropes-Gray Room, Pound Hall. Sponsored by HLS GOP. I got in trouble last time I made a comment about the blood drive being sponsored by the Republicans.  No comments this time.   NEXT WEEK: Great American Meatout.  Stop by for free food, information on vegetarianism and to enter a raffle by pledging to go meat-free for a day. Surely they could have come up with a better name for this.  "Meatout"??  It sounds kind of vulgar.  This last one gets in for the typo.  Or at least I think it's a typo: Working on Campaigns and Women in Politics.  Panels of Attorneys who have worked on campaigns and/or have fun for office.

      Over at  urlLink Crescat , I just posted some stuff about Justice Harry Blackmun's papers and the Nina Totenberg's NPR transcripts about them.  So if actual law-related stuff like that interests you, you can check it out.  I will point out here that before law school, Blackmun was one of my favorite Supreme Court justices, since our last names are homonyms. But since coming to law school, he's become one of my least favorite, since every time his name is mentioned, I worry I've just been called on.   The funniest piece from the  urlLink NPR transcripts :   In the Oral History, Blackmun also described how, in the 1970s, when pornography was a big issue, the justices watched dirty movies...   Blackmun: I remember one time Justice Harlan was there, sitting with his law clerk up font. Of course, his eyesight was almost totally gone, and it was hard for him to see. I sat right behind him, and as the film moved on--and they were all alike // he'd lean over and say to his law clerk, "and what are they doing now?" and the law clerk would describe it and justice Harlan would say, "You don't say, you don't say."

      There's an inane brochure over by Career Services called "Finding the Right Job Using Westlaw"  From the introduction: "We assume that you have completed basic Westlaw training and that you know basic search techniques such as how to sign on to Westlaw, access a database, and formulate a search. To simplify the text, the names of items you click... appear in  bold type .  Database identifiers appear in uppercase type."  I'm  confused .  I understand what  bold type  means because they  bolded  it.  But what in the world does "uppercase" mean??  I'm so confused.  Help me, Westlaw.  I'm only a law student!  The guide is 23 pages of complete nonsense about how in order to search for attorneys in Texas, you must type   Texas  in box marked "state search."  Thanks.  This is a silly waste of paper.

      Well, Wednesday didn't provide much in the way of new content.  Sorry about that.  I'm involved in the law school parody show here -- it's a musical that pokes fun at law school life -- I'm "acting" in it (I have 4 lines, I think, so it's "acting" like flipping pages in my casebooks is "reading") and I was one of a whole bunch of writers for it.  I'm not sure if even a savvy viewer would be able to pick out the material I wrote, but maybe.  But anyway, it's been 6 hours of rehearsal a night for the past couple of nights and for the foreseeable future (the show opens next Tuesday, and runs through Saturday).  So if you see weird post times like 1:30 in the morning, that's why.  But I expect I'll be able to come up with the usual stuff to say.    Comment someone said at rehearsal:  "Watch out for any e-mails from me that look strange.  I think my e-mail has a virus.  I know [his girlfriend] got a virus e-mail from me."  Thing I'm sort of glad I only said to the person sitting next to me and not any louder, even though it really had nothing to do with the people and was just the first thing that popped into my head: "Hope that's the only virus she got from him."

      The NY Times has an  urlLink an article  about how some families are turning a bris into a wedding-like affair (for anyone who doesn't know what a bris is: it's the Jewish ritual where the boy babies get circumsized, 8 days after we're born, by an old Jewish man who is specially trained -- and I believe even licensed -- to circumsize babies).  Pretty ridiculous, but lots of talk of food, so that's good.  In a show I was in at Princeton, there was a short piece (that I didn't write, but was funny anyway) about Mike Tyson performing a bris.  This was shortly after he bit that other boxer's ear.  Use your imagination.

       Four Easy-To-Follow Rules From The Tax Code, Each Taken From A Completely Random Page Of The Code I Opened To, Plus One Fake One Mixed In That's Pretty Easy To Pick Out, But Hopefully Fun To Read Anyway   Sec. 22(c)(2)(B)(ii), regarding tax credits for the elderly -- "In the case of a joint return where both spouses are qualified individuals and at least one spouse has not attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year -- (I) if both spouses have not attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year, the initial amount shall not exceed the sum of such spouses' disability income, or (II) if one spouse has attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year, the initial amount shall not exceed the sum of $5,000 plus the disability income for the taxable year of the spouse who has not attained age 65 before the close of the taxable year."  Sec. 141(b)(2), regarding tax exemption requirements for state and local bonds -- "Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, an issue meets the test of this paragraph if the payment of the principal of, or the interest on, more than 10 percent of the proceeds of such issue is (under the terms of such issue or any underlying arrangement) directly or indirectly -- (A) secured by any interest in -- (i) property used or to be used for a private business use, or (ii) payments in respect of such property, or (B) to be derived from payments (whether or not to the issuer) in respect of property, or borrowed money, used or to be used for a private business use."  Sec. 501(c)(13), on classifications of tax-exempt corporations -- "Cemetery companies owned and operated exclusively for the benefit of their members or which are not operated for profit; and any corporation chartered solely for the purpose of the disposal of bodies by burial or cremation which is not permitted by its charter to engage in any business not necessarily incident to that purpose, no part of the net earnings of which inures to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual."  Sec. 1104(a)(4)(B)(ii)(III)(qq), on how to fold your tax return before putting it in the envelope provided -- "Except as otherwise indicated in this subsection, or in subsection (f), the tax return should be folded with the inked-side facing the preparer, except if (1) the preparer is not the person engaging in the folding activity, or (2) the conditions in subsection (b) are met, or (3) the folder qualifies under the exception in subsection (c) for filers without fingers, and should be folded in thirds, with the bottom-most edge of the page crossing the line marked (x) except as in subsection (y), and with the top-most edge meeting at point (y) except as in subsection (x).  In addition, the address should show through the window and the preparer should affix a postage stamp with value equivalent to or exceeding the current first-class postage rate as delimited in subsection (d)."  Sec. 1237(b)(3)(C), on determining capital gains and losses -- "No improvement shall be deemed a substantial improvement for purposes of subsection (a) if the lot or parcel is held by the taxpayer for a period of 10 years and if -- ...(C) the taxpayer elects, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, to make no adjustment to basis of the lot or parcel, or of any other property owned by the taxpayer, on account of the expenditures for such improvements. Such election should not make any item deductible which would not otherwise be deductible."

      At some point today, my counter will probably reach 100,000. [UPDATE 1:38 PM: I've reached 100,000.  Awesome.]  That's pretty darn cool.  When I started this a little over 18 months ago, I had no idea whether I'd keep it going for a day, a week, a month, or forever.  I certainly didn't expect to build an audience much beyond people who knew me in person, and I am humbled that a multi-digit number of people pass by each day to read the words I write.  When I started this, I did it mostly just to force myself to write something every day.  I wasn't sure if it would work.  It seems to be working.  :)  Knowing there are people out there who like what I'm doing and keep coming back is awfully motivating.  Certainly the e-mails I've received, the people I've corresponded with, the handful of real friends I've made -- it's all made this more than worth it, many times over.  So.  I have a small favor to ask.  And you're allowed to say no, but I feel like 100,000 is a big enough milestone that I can at least ask.  It involves no money.  If you like something you read here, tell someone about it.  If you really like it, tell two people.  If you really really like it, tell that guy you know who works for that magazine, or that girl who works for that literary agency, or Jon Stewart's personal assistant.  Being in law school is great.  The classes are interesting, the professors are great, it's a whole lot of fun, I've met some awesome people.  Anyone who reads consistently probably would guess that fifteen years down the line, the real dream isn't necessarily to be a law firm partner.  That's not to say it's a bad road to go down, and it's not to say that after a summer at a law firm, it won't become the dream.  But a writing gig, even a writing gig on the side, would be awfully cool.  Nothing ventured, nothing gained.  You can keep on reading even if you keep me a secret.  Free riding is welcome and encouraged and expected and awesome.  Thanks for 100,000.  Now I'd better post something funny before you go away.

       It's Clerkship Application Reflection Season!   I was going to go to Career Services' introductory judicial clerkships meeting last Wednesday, but I didn't really feel like listening to someone ramble on about things I could learn just as easily from a website.  So instead I went to see Dennis Kucinich give his stump speech on campus.  But, just to see if I missed anything, I went onto the Career Services site to check it out.  And lucky for me, they had copies of the handouts and power points right there, along with pages and pages and pages of additional information about clerkships, what they taste like, and how many grams of fat they have per serving.  Apparently, people who went to the meeting were treated to a 19-slide power point that wasted a good bit of toner in my printer, since it was light text on a dark background.  But I printed it 8 slides per page, so it's probably not that big of a deal.  But if my printer runs out of ink while printing a final exam, Career Services, it's all your fault.  A U.S. Court of Appeals clerkship, the slide says, is characterized by "very little contact with people."  Sounds lovely.  A State Supreme Court clerkship, in the spirit of 'having a good personality,' is "exciting as [a] court of last resort."  Now that's enticing.  A court of last resort.  If you can't get a job with the one where you will have very little contact with people, you can settle for the last resorts.  "Great for in-state prestige."  Boy, these career services people sure are fooling me into believing they think state supreme courts are great places to clerk.  I bet they describe tall buildings without elevators as "great exercise for the handicapped," and Hark food as "perfect right before you plan on throwing up."  "What's Realistic for You?" the next slide asks.  "B+, some journal, good recs: most state clerkships, many district clerkships; A-, some journal, good recs: all state clerkships, most district clerkships, many circuit clerkships; A, some journal, good recs: all clerkships."  What about "C, no journal, bad recs" ??  Didn't cover that one in the meeting, eh, career services?  Are those the people going to traffic court?  "I need an opinion on that red light, son - and fast!"  Those are the easy judges.  The tough ones want the opinion written before the light turns green.  "Ways to Get Attention," according to career services: going to class naked.  Oh, wait, I meant ways to get attention for a clerkship: high grades, membership on law review, tailored cover letter (I need my cover letter trimmed a little bit in the neckline, if that's okay), cash bribes, compromising photos of judges in their chambers, family connections, cash bribes, federalist society executive board position, familiarity with arcane postal service regulations regarding application mailing, cash bribes, family connections, cash bribes.  According to the timeline, I'm almost a month behind.  For all of February through August, the handout insists, we should "reflect about why you want to do a clerkship and what you offer as a candidate."  Uh, cash bribes.  And a law degree, remember?  Isn't that enough?  I can't wait for the April 6 session of "mail merge logistics."  Sounds thrilling, doesn't it?  I know it sounds exactly like the kind of thing better explained at a meeting than in a step-by-step instruction sheet, right?  Recommendations seem to be an important thing for clerkships.  The OCS website has some helpful advice for procuring those: "At the very least, you should offer to provide stamps to non-faculty recommenders."  Gotcha.  Also, some self-defeating advice courtesy of career services: "Whatever methods you choose, try to give your potential recommenders a graceful way out of writing you a recommendation.  Some may not be willing to write you a good recommendation, but they may not want to tell you so directly.  Busy schedules can be a good cover for you to offer and for them to use if necessary."  Me: "I'd love for you to write a recommendation for me."  Faculty Member: "Uh..."  Me: "But if your schedule is too busy..."  Faculty Member: "Yes, I didn't think of that.  Uh, I mean, yeah, I'm very busy... washing my hair."  [That exchange is funnier you imagine a bald faculty member.]  Career services also advises that before an interview with a judge, you should read that judge's opinions, but not "to the detriment of other methods of preparation, classwork, and/or sleep."  You should, however, read the career services website instead.

      We received our course schedules for next year, following the course lottery earlier this week.  I got everything I wanted, which is good, although I got pretty much everything I wanted last year too, so not a big deal.  I'm not sure whether other people have trouble getting what they want because I want stuff that's less popular, or because I'm somehow better at figuring how to rank the classes in the right sequence to outsmart the system and get what I want.  I'm sure it's the former, but I'd like to pretend it's the latter.  Anyway, my schedule doesn't look quite like  urlLink Mitch 's, but I'm looking forward to it.  The "Creation of the Constitution" class I wanted in the winter term taught by a Judge on the 10th Circuit US Court of Appeals, the "American Democracy" class I wanted co-taught by  urlLink Robert Putnam , a seminar with the word "Emotions" in the title, a class that used Kennedy School case studies as the reading material instead of a casebook, a class taught by a professor who has his own  urlLink tribute page  on the Internet, and many more!  I'm excited!  Or at least as excited as I can be about law school classes.  :)

      The soon-to-be law student at  urlLink Neo Tokyo Times  writes:   I understand law school wont be like [undergrad]. In fact, a rigorous academic schedule is something Im worried about. Ive never done it before. Ive always been able to skate by, secure in the knowledge that while I wont necessarily earn the highest academic marks, Ill make up for that laziness with success in some standardized test score, or extracurricular or professional component to my resume. But in law school, even the choice extracurricular and professional opportunities have a significant display of academic performance as a prerequisite.   My own unproven ability to keep up a demanding study schedule is my primary anxiety about attending law school.   My current plan here is to start putting myself into a mental place where I am comfortable with the idea of sinking into a routine of constant studying and lecture attendance. The only practicing Harvard/ Stanford grad I know suggested that I ignore all non-academic extracurricular activities during my freshman year. We've exchanged e-mails before, so I just e-mailed him some thoughts on that, but as I sent them I realized I may as well post them too.  I think that's awful advice.  Really quite awful.  (Not to say it wouldn't work for some people, and I'm sure it was well-intentioned advice, and maybe it's actually good advice and my advice is awful, I don't know). There are people here who work harder than they did in undergrad.  There are also people here who work less hard.  I think most people probably work about the same.  They all do fine.  Law school is not some other world where people who are smart and competent and can balance school and having a life suddenly are forced to spend 12 hours a day in the library.  Law school is just school.  If you did fine in college, you'll do fine in law school.  Probably with the same study habits.  Yes, there are lots of people who were at the top of their class and are now in the middle of the class -- but it's not because they don't study hard enough, it's just because there's a curve and who knows what they're testing on, and sometimes you just don't get stuff, and you survive.  And, yeah, there are people who spend lots of time studying, and some of them do quite well, but the marginal returns start to get pretty lackluster I think, and studying hard is really no guarantee of anything.  But the people who try to be super-study-man, I think largely are miserable and don't enjoy their time here -- and that doesn't make continuing to study and put in the energy and focus any easier. Maybe it's different elsewhere, where not everyone gets a firm job if they want one -- and I don't mean to apply this advice where it may not belong, because I just don't know what life is like at other schools except for what I hear from a few friends but the happiest -- and most successful -- people I know here do a lot of stuff, to keep them sane -- you CAN'T spend all week studying -- there isn't that much to study!  There's a fair bit of reading, but there's very little writing, much less than in undergrad, many fewer assignments to complete, it's mostly just go to class, do some reading, and have a bunch of hours left over for other stuff.  I have the opposite advice -- 1L year join everything -- so you can figure out what's worth spending your time on.  So maybe a month in you've gone to meetings for 12 activities and you liked 4.  So you forget the other 8, but this way you've met people and seen what's out there, and started to pave the way for a happy and fulfilling 3 years and not a miserable one.  Just my opinion.  This advice may suck.  But doesn't it sound like a happier three years than the other advice?

      Tonight I went to the annual banquet for the law school drama society, where the graduating 3Ls all get "toasted" and people say nice things about them.  It's a nice thing to do, makes people feel good.  It goes on forever, but I think it's a good thing.  What struck me was a common theme.  People kept saying things like, "You're so talented. I hope you don't waste too many years at a firm."  Or "You're such a great person.  I hope you end up doing something great. Something besides being a lawyer."  It's all said so matter-of-factly.  Like of course being a lawyer is a horrible thing, and obviously it will be sad and tragic if this is your fate.  And then everyone goes off to his or her law firm jobs after graduation.  I don't quite understand this.  I understand why individual people think practicing law is not for them, and they want to do something else, but they've ended up here, and need to pay off loans, or need to support a family, or have no other passions, and so this is what they will do.  I understand this completely completely completely, on an individual level.  What I don't understand is how this works on an institutional level.  How the industry can survive and thrive when *everyone* feels like this is not where they should be, and *everyone* sees it as a bad thing to end up as a lawyer, yet everyone ends up at a firm, and new students come in every year, and it perpetuates itself.  Maybe the drama society is a self-selected group of people particularly not drawn to law practice.  But I don't completely think that's true -- I think it's true for some people, but for at least a substantial part, the mix of people in the drama society is not tremendously different from the mix in the rest of the law school.  No one here envisions themselves happy as a lawyer.  I don't know what they envisioned before coming to law school and whether what they've seen is different, or what the deal is exactly -- when people's feelings changed, and why it seems to be too late for anyone to do anything about it -- and even more important, why the industry hasn't changed to reflect this, or what can be done to change this -- or something.  This is not completely articulate, and I'm sure there's a logical flaw somewhere here.  But really -- people in law school are generally not happy.  I'm relatively happy, but it's because I like school and have found lots of fulfilling things that keep me busy and made a bunch of friends and maybe I'm really not relatively happy but just like to believe I am, I don't know -- but I just don't understand why if everyone else isn't happy, they're still here and doing things they think will make them continue to be unhappy in the future.  This is vague.  And I shouldn't write weblog posts at 1:45 in the morning.  Time for sleep.

       Questions and Answers about the end of the school year   Q: My classes end this week.  I'm confused.  A: At most law schools, classes run on a "semester" schedule, which means that they begin at some point, run for a number of weeks, and then end.  After the spring semester, there are normally final examinations and then a summer break.  Many students get jobs over the summer break, many of which are related to things they want to do after law school, although some are really just for prestige and/or pay.  Q: So I'm allowed to leave?  A: Yes.  After exams.  But you should probably get a job first.  Q: But what about my apartment?  A: Well, if you still have a lease, you still have to pay rent.  Q: Even if I'm not there?  A: Yes.  Q: But how can I afford that?  A: Situations are different for everybody.  But you might try "subletting."  Subletting means finding a person (or people) to live in your apartment while you're not there, and pay rent.  Q: Wow.  That sounds cool.  But what if they break my stuff, or drink my milk?  A: If they drink your milk, you should thank them, since your milk is going to be spoiled by the time you get back.  If they break your stuff, you can get a security deposit that can cover potential damages.  Q: Subletters sound great!  But I need a place to go!  Where can I find a job?  A: Many schools have career services professionals who can help you locate opportunities, or at least provide useless lists of nonsense for you to wipe yourself with.  They often set up "career fairs" where potential employers come and look for people.  Sometimes, you can just call up a public interest organization and offer to work for free.  Some schools will even give you a stipend for that.  Q: What is this "public interest" of which you speak?  A: It means legal organizations that do stuff to help people.  Q: Like law firms?  A: Yes, only not evil.  Q: Oh.  But all of my friends are working at law firms, and they'll laugh at me if I work for a "public interest" firm.  A: If all your friends were taking horse steroids and laughing at you because you were content to be small and wimpy while they grew a big furry tail, would you take the pills?  Q: Yes.  I probably would.  I cave into peer pressure easily.  That's why I'm at law school.  A: Come on.  You wouldn't take horse steroids for real, would you?  Q: I'm at law school, not veterinary school.  I don't really know all the facts.  A: Okay. Let me phrase this in a way you might understand, since you're in law school.  There are 6 people at the stables.  Harry is taking horse steroids, Barry is brushing his tail, Larry is laughing at you, Cary is cutting the pills in half, Gary is going home.  What would you do?  Q: I'd kill Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the broom closet.  A: There was no broom closet in "Clue."  Q: Are you sure?  A: Yes.  Q: Oh.  I must be confused.  A: Maybe it's the horse steroids.  Q: Perhaps.  Where were we again?  A: I don't remember.  So you're cool with all the summer stuff?  Q: Yeah, yeah, I got it.  Thanks.  A: No problem.

       Attn: Harvard Law Students and HLS students-to-be   Although it's unlikely that more HLS students read this than our weekly newsletter ("The Adviser") or our automated e-mail announcements about stuff like this ("Flashmod"), perhaps the audience I'm trying to reach is more likely to be found here, so indulge me for a moment as I try to exercise my extracurricular responsibilities:  1. Anyone who might be interested in writing a regular (or irregular) column in The Record newspaper next year, about anything (or nothing at all) including 3Ls who may be interested in writing, pseudonymously or not, about their post-graduation lives and jobs (I think this could be really cool if I could find people willing to contribute), and including 1Ls-to-be who might want to write about 1L life, send me an e-mail.  2. Any 1Ls or 2Ls (or 1Ls-to-be) who want to get involved in the Parody Show writing process, send me an e-mail.  We've got a Yahoo group going where we're going to try and get input/ideas/jokes/etc from throughout the law school.  A whole continuum of possibilities to be involved, from just contributing some names and stories to really trying to help us write the script.  /end of solicitation

      Excerpted from the piece I might run in this week's law school newspaper, although not if I can come up with something better, since this is probably ok but not especially thrilling:    Summers Coming!   The driving rain and forty-degree temperatures tell me summers close here in Cambridge.  The years gone almost as fast as the coffee available each morning, even though each class on its own seems to move as slow as the automatic handicapped doors in the student center.  As we open our casebooks for the first time all semester and begin studying for exams, a flood of memories fills our heads -- the time we signed up to subcite for the Journal of Unmatched Density thinking it sounded like fun; the time we ran for publicity director of the Students For Negligible Reform thinking it would look good on a resume; the time we went with our friends to the professors office hours hoping to extract some exam hints; the time we stepped over the body of the law review editor whod leaped from the second-floor window of the law review building to his death; and the time we fell asleep on a bean-bag chair in the library and woke up sticky.  Well start the summer relieved to be out of the classroom and finally putting our legal education into practice, applying what weve learned about sitting in assigned seats, navigating complex and counter-intuitive bureaucratic processes, skating on thin ice (even if that doesnt make sense, I like the double meaning), and drinking free coffee. But after a few weeks away from this place, I feel confident saying well wish we were back.  Our community of highly-motivated largely self-absorbed young people will have been replaced by a community of highly-motivated largely self-absorbed older people; our perhaps-less-than-inspiring extracurricular pursuits will be replaced with perhaps-less-than-inspiring uber-organized mandatory social activities; our inspiring professor mentors will be replaced by people who finished just below them in their graduating classes here or in New Haven and are now actually forced to practice law; an evening at Redline [a Harvard Square bar] will be replaced by evenings redlining; lunch at Finagle-a-Bagel [a Harvard Square bagel shop] will be replaced by lunch at Prepare-a-File-for-Trial; dinner at Brother Jimmys [a Harvard Square barbeque joint; part of a chain] will be replaced by dinner with Partner Johnny; and nights in the Hark [our student center] will be replaced by nights in the dark, if youre in New York and theres another blackout.  [You like the wordplay, don't you?]  Ill be at a firm this summer, for the first time ever, so I may not be the right person to provide advice about how to make the most of your summer.  But why should I let that stop me?  So heres three ideas to make your summer worthwhile:  1. Convince as many paralegals as you can that law school really isnt the right choice for them.  They look up to us; were where they wish they might someday be; isnt that sad?  Show them your casebooks.  Let them see a copy of a journal and explain to them that the reason that semicolon isnt there anymore is all thanks to you.  See them flee.  Save them before its too late.  2. Steal stuff.  Staplers, post-it notes, personal shredding machines, trophies and plaques from peoples offices, diplomas off the wall, valuable art in the hallways, sensitive documents, the spare $5000 suit in the partners closet, a new BMW, the Yankees skybox pass, the pictures of the partners children (they wont notice), the firms financial statements, your 43rd-story view.  Come on, its fun!  3. And, finally, if youre a high achiever, try and single-handedly undermine the rule of law in just twelve weeks.  This is an awesome goal: Can one summer associate alone bring down a nation?  Send Polaroids secret strategy memo over to Kodak.  Send the partners uncorrected brief to The Smoking Gun.  Tell the client the deposition will be held on the set of The Daily Show.  I dont know how to do it, but maybe you can figure it out.  One summer. Make a big mess.  You can do it.  I have faith.

      I want to plug a web site I just found.   urlLink WhyNot.Net  is a companion site to a book called "Why Not?" by Yale professors Barry Nalebuff and Ian Ayres that I've been meaning to read but haven't yet, but the site has a message board where people can post their ideas for little things that could improve life -- cancelable elevator buttons, alternate commentary tracks on TV sports games, TiVo for car radio, etc.  Nalebuff co-wrote a book called "Thinking Strategically" with Princeton professor Avinash Dixit, who I took a class from my freshman year -- the book was really interesting (on game theory and that kind of stuff), so that's why "Why Not?" is on my to-read list... Nalebuff is also the co-founder of Honest Tea, which makes iced tea that isn't sickeningly sweet, and that I kind of like... and that I found cool when I first tried it and figured out it was the same guy who'd co-written the book I'd read.  The site's fascinating.  Just killed about a half hour of my afternoon reading.  The book has moved up on my list of things to read.

      2 stories:  1. My Corporations professor calls on people in order of where they sit, going down one row, and then snaking back the next row, etc.  He only gets to a handful of people each day and it's a big class, so he made it through once but is only about 1/3 of the way back in his second pass.  I sit in the fourth row, second from the end he starts on, and last week he got to the next-to-last person in the row in front of me, so I was going to be third today, and then the rest of my row, etc.  So I get to class about a minute and a half late this morning -- it's an 8:30 class; I try -- and my row was *completely empty.*  No one was there.  At all.  My friend who sits next to me did show up about five minutes later, but still, that was 2 out of about 7 in the row -- and I could see the guy in the center section, who surely expected to be safe, since there were 7 people to get through before him, pretty frantically reading ahead, in case he got called on.    During the 10-minute break in the middle of class, I noticed most of my row scattered around the room, just not in their seats -- so they wouldn't get called on (he skips you if he doesn't see you in your seat).  It turned out that since tomorrow's the last day of class the professor wanted to get through the material and didn't call on anyone -- so it didn't really matter -- but it seemed awfully silly to me that the rest of my row was so concerned about getting called on.  It's not like this professor's questions are particularly vexing, they're just summarize the facts of the case, maybe answer a couple of short questions about them, and he jumps right in with the answer if anyone seems like they have no idea -- so it's not torture.  I don't know, called on twice a semester, you can't just suck it up and deal?  Silly.  Silly silly silly.  2. On the way back from class, I stopped in at a bakery and got a muffin -- I hadn't eaten anything before class.  The woman behind me in line ordered a full-size chocolate cake.  The guy behind the counter, out of reflex I'm sure, asked if it was for here or to go.  The woman exploded at him.  "For here.  I'm going to eat an entire chocolate cake sitting right here, obviously.  It's to go.  Clearly.  Gosh."  And then she muttered something under her breath that is probably unprintable anyway.  All that mental energy used up.  Wow.  Was it worth it?  Did she really think he thought she was going to eat the cake there?  I bet she beats her kids.

      Found a sublessor for the summer.  Should make him sign this:   Lawyer's First Sublet Agreement, after taking too many required classes   1. This contract, which serves as the objective manifestation of the subjective intent of Sublessor (S) and Lessor (L), binds Sublessor to pay Lessor three months rent at $X/month, payable in cash, check, or other negotiable instrument.  The dollar figure provided is in American currency and is not affected by international exchange rates.  2. Lessor is not liable for any torts or crimes committed by Sublessor while in the apartment, including, but not limited to, manslaughter.  3. This agreement is not to be construed as the creation of an agency or partnership relationship between Lessor and Sublessor, as if that would actually have any bearing on anything.  4. Sublessor will be responsible for tax implications of this arrangement, whatever they might be.  5. No part of this agreement confers any ownership rights on Sublessor, and does not establish the right to any future adverse possession claims.  6. Sublessor has the right to speak in the apartment, at a normal volume, regardless of the content of the speech.  7. If Sublessor invites people over to the apartment, that does not mean it is being opened up as a limited-purpose public forum.  Sorry.  8. This agreement is governed by the law of Massachusetts, and any disagreements will be resolved through binding arbitration and an implied term of good faith, which is no longer implied because I'm writing it here.  9. Sign twelve times at the bottom.  Thank you.

      As finals loom closer, instead of opening up my Corporations casebook, I decided to go see Harvard's "Freshman Musical," which is a musical written and performed entirely by (undergrad) freshmen.  Because seeing this stuff interests me.  It was reasonably well-done -- this was the Saturday matinee, so the audience was small (about 75 people in a space that could hold perhaps 500) although I assume it was larger for the Thursday and Friday night shows and will be larger for the fourth and final show tonight.  Apparently it's admitted students weekend, and that's an audience they hope to grab -- although there only seemed to be about a dozen admitted students there.  It was interesting -- the female admitted students (all of the admitted students seemed to have the same bright red folder, so that's how I could tell) came in as a big group of 6 or 7, all sat together, introduced themselves to the people around them, were very friendly, and looked like they were enjoying themselves immensely.  The 4 or 5 male admitted students came in by themselves, sat in seats separated from anyone else, and looked generally uncomfortable and out of place.  I don't know why I noticed this -- surely if I was an admitted student I would have looked like the guys did, and would have been too shy to proactively try and make friends with people I didn't know -- but I thought the gender split interesting.  The show itself was enjoyable.  The music was considerably stronger than the lyrics, the script was fine and occasionally funny, the acting was solid; I was struck by how few singers were in the show -- that is, people who were trusted to sing.  There were no less than a dozen and a half actors and actresses, but only 5 sang at all, and really only one guy sang a lot -- he sang perhaps 9 of the 13 songs, or something like that, although a bunch of the songs were more like song-lets.  He had a fine voice.  The two girls they let sing both had excellent voices.  Two other guys sang a little bit.  No one else sang at all except as chorus bulk in a couple of numbers.  But for a show without any apparent professional influence, it was solid.  I enjoyed it, which should really be the measure I guess.  And I'm certainly glad I went.  So anyone on the Harvard campus reading this who has nothing to do tonight -- I'll give it a plug and recommend it.

      It's request day.  Scroll down for more.  Request #4: "I request 20 Questions with the Harvard Law School Ice Rink."  That sounds like fun; I can do that.   20 Questions with the Harvard Law School Ice Rink   1. Thanks for taking the time to talk with me.  Was it hard to fit me into your schedule?  No.  I'm an ice rink, and it's spring.  I've melted.  There really isn't much else on my plate.  Besides water.  2. What did it feel like to finally get that promotion from little cubes in people's drinks to an ice rink at the world's most prestigious law school?  It felt good.  I'd been working hard for this chance for a while.  When the Titanic hit my cousin, I was kind of jealous of all the publicity he got, but, as they say, eventually my ship came in as well.  And now, I'm the most famous ice rink at any Ivy League law school in the nation.  It's quite an honor.  3. How do you feel about the new law clerk hiring plan?  Oh, I don't know much about law clerks.  I'm just an ice rink.  You're better off asking  urlLink Howard Bashman  or someone like that.  Sorry.  4. Who's your favorite skater to have ever skated on top of you?  That would probably have to be the law school dean, since she got off very quickly after the promotional photographs were taken.  Lovely woman.  5. Proudest moment?  Killing all the grass underneath me.  It was a triumph for ice everywhere.  6. Worst moment?  When they destroyed me after I started to melt.  Give an ice rink a break, okay?  It was hot, I was sweaty, what do you want me to do?  I tried my hardest, but apparently my hardest wasn't good enough for Harvard Law School.  7. You've already said you worked hard to earn the promotion from ice cubes to ice rink, but what was the hiring process like?  Was it competitive?  Absolutely.  It started off back in college, when I knew that if I wanted to be an ice rink at an Ivy League law school I would need to keep my temperature down and do well on the IRAT (Ice Rink Aptitude Test).  I scored a 174, which was 99th percentile, and that was enough to put me in the mix.  I submitted my application, including a photo professionally done after a trip to the Zamboni Salon, and a few months later I got the big envelope in the mail.  It was an exciting day.  8. How did your family feel?  They were speechless.  9. How about your husband?  He was frozen in place.  10. Your kids?  They were a little cold.  11. Really?  Why?  They knew we'd have to move to Cambridge.  And they weren't looking forward to the weather.  Way too warm.  6 months a year of sunshine and tolerable temperatures.  It's just not wicked nasty enough.  12. I see you've picked up some of the lingo.  "Wicked"?  Have you also become a Red Sox fan?  Oh, no, baseball's not my sport.  I'm a huge hockey fan, though.  Love them New York Islanders.  13. The Islanders?  Really?  Sure.  Been a big fan for years.  Usually I do a guest stint when their rink gets a fever a few times a year.  14. What's next for you, now that you've been melted down and destroyed?  Well, I'm capitalizing on my notoriety and going on a world tour with the Ice Capades, followed by a stint as guest judge on American Idol.  15.  Hmmm.  How exactly will that work?  I don't know, but they promised me I wouldn't have to appear with that insipid Simon Cowell.  I hate the British.  They're more fans of the rain than the ice, I think.  16. What do you like to do in your spare time?  Listen to music.  17. Your favorite artist?  Vanilla Ice, of course.  18. If you could have three people, living or dead, skate on you, who would they be?  Tinkerbell, Eddie Gaedel [a 4' baseball player who appeared once for the St. Louis Cardinals as a pinch hitter, wearing the number 1/8], and Gary Coleman.  19. Why??  They're all small.  Big people hurt me when they fall.  20. I understand.  Any last words for my readers?  No.  Thanks to the Harvard Law School Ice Rink for talking the time to me.  It is appreciated.  You can check out the Ice Rink's blog at harvardlawschoolicerink.blogspot.com.  No, you can't.

      It's request day.  See below.  Request #3 comes from Matt, who asks for "I want you to write [an entry] entitled "If I Ran the Harvard Law School," in the spirit of Dr. Seuss's "If I Ran the Zoo" and "If I Ran the Circus."  Do it in Seussian rhyme, and tell us what you would change about HLS if you were suddenly made Dean."  Well, I asked for it, so I guess I can't complain. I'll do my best, or at least my best given that I'm hungry and want to go eat some lunch pretty soon.   If I Ran The Harvard Law School   If I ran the Harvard Law School There would not be any grades All the dorms would be gigantic And be cleaned by comely maids All the classes would be shorter And there'd always be free snacks There would be no class required And we would not offer Tax My admissions process revamp Would include an interview The tuition would be lowered The school year would be shortened too All the faculty with tenure Would have no more guarantees I would hasten global warming So the winters would not freeze I would mandate legal ethics I would kill the law review I would paint the buildings colors Maybe yellow, maybe blue I would make the dining service Something edible, at least And each year, on some day special There would be a giant feast Where the faculty would mingle With the students and the staff We would be one happy family God forbid, someone might laugh I would banish all the law firms There would be no jobs to seek But if course if I did that We would be closed within a week.

      It's request day.  See below.  Request #2 comes from Matthew, who asks, "How about a piece on the first couple weeks of the summer firm job?"  Well, I didn't work at a firm last summer, so I can't really help you yet.  I can do some imagining though...     The First 2 Weeks Of A Summer Firm Job, The Really Quick Imaginary Diary   Day 1.  I arrived.  I got a nametag and a free lunch.  They gave me a desk.  I met Sally, my assistant who I share with 3 other summer associates. One of them already made her pick up laundry.  We had a training session.  Day 2.  Free lunch again.  I met Bob, the partner I'll be working for.  He seems like he's pretty wealthy.  His assistant is gold-plated.  She got his laundry for him twice today.  He told me to read up on International Tax Litigation.  Day 3.  Free lunch, dinner, and a Broadway show.  I didn't do any work today.  Day 4.  Another training session.  Learned how to fill out a timesheet.  Lunch was catered in.  We had our first "Thursday night dinner," which is apparently a summer tradition.  Day 5.  One of my fellow associates fell off the yacht they took us on and drowned.  Oh well.  Day 6.  It's Saturday.  I'm at home, sleeping.  Day 7.  A bunch of my fellow associates and I went and spent a lot of money doing something frivolous, because our summer salaries are so high.  Day 8.  Back in the office.  I have to write a memo.  I asked someone for help.  They helped me.  I did some Lexis searching.  And some Westlaw searching.  And had a free lunch.  Day 9.  They took us out for a "Tuesday night dinner," which is apparently a summer tradition.  I met some more partners at the cocktail party we had in the afternoon.  Bob said he's going to take me out golfing tomorrow.  Day 10.  Went golfing with Bob.  Worked on my memo.  Had some more training.  Day 11.  Went golfing with Bob again.  Handed in my memo.  They said it sucked but it doesn't matter.  "Thursday night dinner."  Day 12.  Called in sick.  Firm sent me flowers. They're very nice.  My assistant quit because my fellow associate made her clean his apartment.  Day 13.  Saturday.  No work, of course.  Firm paid for lunch anyway.  Day 14.  Ate in exclusive restaurant that was too expensive.  Polluted a river.  Don't remember how.

      Like I said below, having stolen the concept from elsewhere, it's request day here, from now until dinnertime tomorrow.  Request #1 comes from Andy, who asks "I'm requesting more wild and crazy anecdotes about Harvard Law professors."  Andy, most law professors, as I'm sure you know, don't seem too wild and crazy.  I had one professor make a joke about condoms that I can't quite remember exactly, and since he's in his 70s, that's pretty wild and crazy I suppose.  Our former Dean used to have a beard.  That's kind of wild.  My Crim Law professor came to class one day holding a dozen red pens, for no obvious reason, and just held onto them the entire class.  Which was kind of crazy.  My Tax professor occasionally gives out candy, which may seem wild and crazy, and even had the school provide pizza and cookies one day, which is definitely crazy.  My Corporations professor occasionally starts class up to 4 minutes late, which is awfully wild for a Corporations professor, although it may have to do with the class being at 8:30 in the morning and the room being half-full.  That's all the true stuff I can come up with, but here's some invented stuff:   Ten Marginally Wild And Crazy Things No Professor Of Mine Has Done (Yet)   1. Smiled. 2. Showed us his tattoo of the "section" symbol. 3. Let us out early. 4. Come to class naked. 5. Have class outside. 6. Have class outside in the middle of a snowstorm. 7. Cancel the exam. 8. Lectured while patting head and rubbing stomach at the same time. 9. Used competitor's casebook when he had written one of his own on the subject. 10. Gotten through all of the assigned reading.

      My computer has an illness of some sort.  Lots of extra programs starting up and running in the background.  Spyware, I've been told.  I deactivated them from the Startup menu and that seems to be helping, but it feels like a bandaid on a headache, or something like that.  But we'll see.  Besides that, I've been thumbing through the course catalog in anticipation of the "General Course Lottery" on Tuesday, which follows the "Legal Profession Lottery," the "2L Bundle Lottery," and the "Clinical Lottery" in the Harvard eighteen-step course selection system.  We choose our entire year's schedule at once.  And most of the good stuff fills up, so there's a whole science to ranking your choices properly to maximize chances of getting a good schedule.  I did pretty well this year, and the stuff I'm looking at for next year mostly isn't on the list of stuff that regularly fills up if not a top choice, so I should be okay.  I've found enough of interest to fill a schedule, but not too much beyond that.  My usual plan to choose professors over classes works less well when most of the good-reputation professors seem to be on leave and there's tons of visitors from elsewhere.  I'll probably end up cross-registering for some credits with classes at the Kennedy School or Business School (if stuff looks interesting) but we can't do that until the fall.  In the meantime, my choices look remarkably flaky, at least as compared to what I could be taking -- Evidence, Fed Courts, Admin Law -- none of which sound especially appealing to me.  I took Con Law and Bankruptcy last semester and am taking Tax and Corps this semester, so I figure I've taken enough standard stuff.  But somehow "Land Use Planning," "Health Care Institutions," "Leadership in the Public Sector," "Legal History," "Law and Psychology," "Economic Regulation of Antitrust," "The Creation of the Constitution," and "American Democracy" all sound kind of liberal-artsy for law school.  But those are what sound interesting to me, and if I'm not going to take the classes that sound interesting, why should I even bother taking any?  Yes, I like that theory, even if it makes no sense.  Tonight, I'm having dinner with some relatives in Newton, a train ride which will take longer than I'm giving it.  I'm bringing a library book to read on the train -- Gregg Easterbrook's "The Progress Paradox," which I'm 20 pages into so far, and it's really interesting.  Yes, this is the kind of stuff I read for pleasure.  I'll post a review tonight or tomorrow, assuming it doesn't put me to sleep on the train.  Either that, or I'll post a review of this week's New York magazine, if I change my mind and decide not to try and read a real book on the subway.  :)  Also:  urlLink Scheherazade  did an "all-request" blog day on Wednesday that was sort of a cool concept.  So I'll make the next 24 hours all-request.  You e-mail me a request -- to answer a question, to write a song parody, to post the number of pairs of socks I have (what??), I'm all yours.  Go.  (If no one e-mails, or even if some people e-mail, I'm going to make up some requests, so be ready for that.  Maybe a Zoomerang quiz to tell the real from the fake, since the last Zoomerang poll went pretty nicely.)

      Someone e-mailed me the other day asking if I had any advice as far as what to do to prepare for law school.  Here was my reply, which I figured I'd post because it might be useful to other 1Ls-to-be:  I spent 2 or 3 days during the summer before law school skimming some free commercial outlines I found on the Internet about the classes I'd be taking, just to get a vague idea what I'd be learning.  I found that was more than enough preparation, and actually did sort of make me familiar with some new words and ideas that came in handy to be able to follow the material right away.  More than that would seem unnecessary. Honestly, I can't think of anything necessary to do to prepare for law school -- they assume you know nothing when you start, and you never know what your professors are going to emphasize and how they're going to teach the subjects anyway.  Certainly any kind of pre-law class would undoubtedly be a waste of money and time.  People make a big deal about study skills and that stuff, but it's not much different from college, I don't think. Anything beyond buying some highlighters and notepads would seem like more than what's necessary.  Get the rest of your life in order, I guess -- and make a conscious effort in the first few weeks to have a balanced life and not spend all of your energy on law school or you'll be miserable.  I don't know... it's just school... people make way too big a deal out of it.  You could absolutely walk in completely cold, knowing nothing, having done nothing at all to prepare, and you'll be in no worse shape than anyone else. Really.

      I need a very brief bit of very non-serious advice, by 3:00 this afternoon.  In this week's law school newspaper, should I run "Wexis Training" (see directly below) or "A Job Advice Session for the Soul-less" (scroll down just a bit for Monday)?  (Both very shortly below)  My worry with "Job Advice" is that it's kind of angry, and people could take it the wrong way.  My worry with "Wexis" is that it's not as good.  I'm not going to promise to take whatever advice this poll yields, but it may help.  So if you're so inclined....  This also gives me an opportunity to try something I've been thinking about for a while -- an online poll.  So go  urlLink here  to take my one-question, completely anonymous, three-second, multiple choice survey, if you want.  If there's something un-fun about Zoomerang, let me know so I don't use it again.  UPDATE: It's now 3:15, and I'm heading over shortly to the newspaper to place my column.  The Zoomerang poll was 26-16, so there was a clear winner, but not overwhelmingly so.  Which at least makes me feel like neither one would be *terrible* to run.  Thanks to the 42 people who voted -- it's appreciated.  Feel free to continue to vote, since I'm curious if the results will hold.  FURTHER UPDATE: I did a rewrite on both and combined them into one two-part column, thus removing the need for the poll at all, although it did tell me they were both decent, so that was helpful.  I've made the Job Advice one slightly more palatable (for me) by replacing the bottom few paragraphs with this:   Look, maybe these really are good tips to find success in the workplace.  Maybe the people who scheme and manipulate do find their way to the top.  But if so, isnt that a problem to fix and not a situation to merely accept?  Perhaps ought we be working to figure out why integrity and success cant go hand in hand, if in fact they cant, instead of giving out revolting advice like this and encouraging everyone to make the world a more cynical and unpleasant place?    If the session was wrong, and we dont need to sacrifice decency and integrity to have a successful career, then OCS should certainly be ashamed. But if the session was right, I think the law school should be even more ashamed, because if were not the people who can change the status quo, and make these places better, then who will?  I believe the law school has a duty to teach us not just how to be good lawyers, but to avoid turning us into bad people in the process.  I left the OCS session feeling dirty.  Shameful. The last line I'll change before it runs -- just a placeholder for now.

       Wexis Training   "Thanks for coming to Wexis training, even though your firm is forcing you.  I'm a relentlessly happy woman earning a substandard salary in a soul-numbing job that involves spending my entire workweek demonstrating how to search for stuff in an electronic database, with my only joy coming in the pleasure on students' faces when I give them free Wexis points that they can redeem for booze and hookers.  You, checking your e-mail, here's 100 points just for smiling.  Thanks.   As a reward for attending this Wexis training session, you have your choice of a Wexis t-shirt, coffee mug, set of pillowcases, money clip, or pet sterilization device.  Please indicate your choice by logging into your account, clicking on the bright green button, scrolling down to the row labeled "Wexis is God.  God is Wexis," and selecting your choice.  While you ponder the options, I will be passing around a brochure, entitled, "Decoding the Wexis pricing plan in such a way that your firm thinks you're really efficient but Wexis gets to buy another island in the Caribbean."  I can see with my magic Wexis x-ray glasses that you're all selected your choice.  Here's twenty more points for each of you.  They're like crack.  Now I'd like you all to click on preferences, and repeat after me: "I prefer Wexis.  I prefer Wexis."  You'll notice a line that asks whether you'd like to choose "time billing" or "transactional billing."  Right now, as we bait the hook and reel you in, everything is free.  But once you?re at a firm, everything costs a lot of money, because the marginal cost of database access is tremendous.    And while it's true that most firms pay a flat rate larger than the nation's GDP to have unlimited access to Wexis, they pass those costs to their clients with a substantial markup, so it's important to bill for as many searches as possible.  Except that some clients are naughty boys and girls and they read their bills carefully and get mad when the charges are too high.  Wexis wishes those clients would disappear, and is working on a Wexis client disappearing tool that you will soon be able to buy for just a few hundred Wexis points.  The key, therefore, is billing as much as possible up until the point where the clients won't pay.  It's like The Price is Right: find the highest cost without going over.  And everything in today's Showcase Showdown is available using Wexis points.  You, with the scowl on your face, here's 100 Wexis points just for not strangling me.  Thanks.  We're going to start the search by clicking on "Find Some Crap," which is the red button fourteenth from the left.  Clicking on this button will cost $87.50.  Click twenty-one times.  Now.  Great.  You, with your pants around your ankles, here's a hundred Wexis points just because I think you're neat.  Thanks.  Searching in the largest database, "All Cases, Ever," will cost $4,537 per search.  But you can save your firm money by choosing a narrower database.  Searching in "Justice Thompson's cases from last Wednesday? will only cost $2,719.  See, a comparative bargain! You can use "Search Destroyer" to add irrelevant terms to your search query and bring back fewer results for you to wade through in search of the applicable law.  Also try "Restrict at Random" to get a sampling of cases which may or may not be useful.  Clicking on "Can't Focus" will make the screen wobble back and forth, simulating how you would feel if you were me, conducting hundreds of legal searches each day, and receiving a salary entirely in Wexis points.  Clicking on "Key Search" will let you find the narrow area of the law that your topic may fall into, by 32-digit code number.  Clicking on "Key Lime" will make a pie come out of your speakers.  Clicking on "Key West" will enter you in the Wexis "Trip to Florida" contest.  Under the "Shred A Document" tab, you will be able to remove cases from our database so your fellow summer associates won't be able to find them and you'll pass them on the firm's ranking charts, which are available on Wexis for an additional fee.  You, with the facial moles, here's 100 Wexis points so you can try to get that fixed.  Clicking on "Live Support" will put you in touch with a Wexis representative, who is available for free research consultations, or, at a cost of $4.95/minute, massage with release.  She will also have the code for the secret Lexis porn database, searchable by keyword, gender, or illegality by jurisdiction.  Finally, click on "History" to read the inspiring story of a legal researcher who woke up one morning and decided to start making monopoly profits by putting every published opinion on the Internet and charging obscene amounts for access.  You can print his story for later enjoyment, at the standard rate of $3/line.  That's also how much cocaine costs, subsidized with a portion of your Wexis points.   I'm glad to have had the chance to talk to you today about Wexis, the greatest thing ever.  Enjoy your summers!"

      In response to my post about career advice (below), a friend e-mailed:   Harvard's duty isn't to compel consenting adults (some of whom are good people, some of whom aren't) to be better people--this isn't kindergarten, and we don't take classes on the value of being true to yourself.  Harvard meets its obligation by presenting us with a variety of theories of success (some of which you might find revolting). I'm not sure about this one.  I'd like to think Harvard, and all educational institutions, have something of a duty to better society, and I'm not sure it betters society to advise people to be jerks in order to get ahead in their careers.  I don't know. And I'm not sure a couple of classes on being true to yourself, whatever that means, would be such a bad idea.

      Unlearned Hand has a  urlLink great post  about law students and the transformation from "I want to do public interest" to "I just took my law firm offer" perhaps being too quick for some, and without the self-reflection it might deserve:   my objection is that law school does not encourage law students to actively make that choice, to engage in the debate.... Instead, there is a one-way locomotive headed for Destination Law Firm. As such, many students never decide that a law firm is right for them. They just go with the flow and that's where they end up. I suppose I'm partially objecting just on autonomy grounds, lamenting the lack of conscious decision-making. I don't really have a ton to add to what he's got there... I'll agree that law schools really don't encourage that type of thinking, and there really is a push toward the big firms that you have to expend much energy and resist much pressure to avoid.   urlLink Waddling Thunder , who also has a post from today pointing to my post below about the job advice session -- he was there too and also found it pretty appalling, writes that he doesn't really have any moral qualms about working for a firm despite that the argument can be made that they sometimes defend people and companies who do bad things.  One thing he writes (and UH quotes it in his post) gives me pause, though:   the moment lawyers begin making self righteous judgments more than very occasionally about who we are and aren't going to represent zealously, we endanger the rule of law. Maybe this makes me a bad law student, but I don't know what this means.  I don't believe that I have at any point in the past two years reflected on "the rule of law" and who deserves to be represented by lawyers and who doesn't, and whether society would fall apart if we didn't let tobacco companies have lawyers.  This may just mean Waddling Thunder is better suited for this law stuff, which may be the case.  But I wonder whether my lack of reflection over whether concerns about the rule of law can trump any moral qualms about law firms is atypical.

       A 'Job Advice' Session for the Soul-less   "Go to firm social events, and collect information from what people say when they're drunk - but you can't be hammered yourself."  This is apparently what the Office of Career Services exists to tell us.  At today's session, "What Law School Doesn't Teach You, But You Really Ought To Know," I learned that I should spend my summer lying, manipulating, brown-nosing, scheming, and "the most important rule: don't be yourself" in order to ensure my law firm success.  Aside from the shameful fact that there are actually people who will take this advice and become just a few more examples of why people hate lawyers, it's even more shameful that the school has its name on the session.  If my tuition is paying for this, I want my money back.  We should aim higher than this.  "I'm going to teach you how to turn fabulous opportunities into great careers," we were told.  And how to turn pounds of raw meat into delicious beef jerky in just twenty-five minutes with the brand-new, state-of-the-art deluxe Food Dehydrator.  "It's not how smart you are.  It's how smart people think you are.  It's not how hard you work - it's how hard people think you work."  Come on.  "Don't be yourself, and don't follow your instincts."  In other words, be phony and disingenuous.  Exactly the kind of person everyone loves to be around.  "Students often ruin their image by making casual comments around the office.  If someone asks you how you like the job, say 'I'm learning a lot,' even if what you're thinking is 'I'm learning a lot about how I don't want to work here.'"  At this point in the session, I was learning a lot.  I was learning a lot about sad the world is, and how pathetic it is that someone thought this was something students would benefit from.  Here are some more things I'm going to say when they ask me how my summer is going - not lies, of course - just ways of "disguising the truth" - "I've never had an experience quite like this," "It's certainly been something," "What a great question," and "Pardon?  I'm not quite sure I caught that."  "Always carry a copy of the evaluation criteria with you - so you can constantly check that you're getting the right experience.  Keep a file, and write down every compliment you get."  November 13, 1:25 P.M. Paralegal said she liked my tie.  November 14, 2:03 P.M. Senior partner thanked me for holding the door for him.  November 15, 9:17 A.M.  Fifth-year associate said I have nice penmanship.  What exactly is the file for? Creeping people out, or evidence for the wrongful termination lawsuit after you're accidentally "yourself" one day and tell someone you think you might be coming down with a cold.  Tsk, tsk.  "Make friends with the support staff to get gossip... one associate [bribed them with] muffins every week."  Wait, wait, wait - so you're not supposed to make real friends at work - "work is not a confessional" - but you're supposed to make friends to the extent they can feed you gossip (if you feed them muffins).  Got it.  Personal integrity, no, I don't think you're part of this session, sorry.  "Never get defensive when people are criticizing your work."  "If someone comes back to you and says you did something wrong, you should just show them the e-mail you sent them to confirm the assignment, and prove [they're the ones wrong]."  Uh, consistency?  "Not my fault - the e-mail I sent you said THIS!" sounds pretty defensive to me.  Bottom line: I think this stuff is awful.  I think that the law school underestimates us if they think any advice like this is helpful advice, and should be ashamed if they think that this advice in particular is appropriate, dignified, or even any good.  The workplace environment the speaker would like us to create is an environment I can't imagine anyone finding fulfilling, enjoyable, or even tolerable, whether a law firm or any place of business.  My "most important rule" from now on: don't go to sessions like these (unless you need to write a column).

      Two people told me my weblog was ugly (although they liked the content).  So I've changed the background color from gray to blue.  So if you're noticing something looks different, you're right.  Anyone who wants more radical change is going to need to volunteer to html-code it.  :)  Seriously, let me know if you want the gray background back, or any other minor suggestions that I can reasonably do without much risk of messing other stuff up.

       Oh Well, At Least I Tried    urlLink The New York Times  has an article in Monday's paper about BloggerCon, which I wrote about below.  I had my fingers crossed that I would get quoted in the article, which would have been so freaking awesome, but it was not to be.  During the "Blogging as Business" session, I got there after all of the seats were filled and sat on the floor near the front of the room.  A few minutes later, a woman got there and squeezed in next to me.  Her nametag labeled her as Julie Flaherty, New York Times.  "Serendipity," I thought to myself.  "Somehow, I must at least make an attempt to get quoted in her article, because that would be ridiculously cool."  So, I carefully formulated a pithy soundbite: "Writing a weblog is fun; talking about weblogs, not so much."  And at one particularly boring moment during the discussion, she turned over in my direction, and I caught eye contact, and decided to share my "spontaneous" thought.  She laughed, and wrote it down.  And asked me my name.  And wrote it down.  "Cool!" I thought.  A minute later, getting greedy, I formulated another pithy sound bite after someone mentioned they spend 5-6 hours a day trying to sell ads on their site.  "Blogging is supposed to be fun.  People want to make money doing it because it's fun.  Selling ads 6 hours a day doesn't sound like fun.  It sounds like work."  She scribbled that down too.  I figured if I said anything else she'd think I was just being annoying, or trying to get quoted.  Or maybe she figured that all along, since she didn't use my quotes in the article.  But the article was short, and she had lots of pages of notes she took.  I wasn't really expecting to get quoted, but it would have been so, so, so, so cool.  I'm a little disappointed.  But I can't feel too bad.  At least I tried.  I would've been annoyed at myself had I not at least tried.  At least she laughed and wrote it down.  That made my day at least a little bit.  NOTE 1: One particular blog mentioned in the article currently gets an average of 367 visits/day, its sitemeter says, with about 450 on a weekday.  I am profoundly curious what happens to that number over the next few days, based on the article.  I have no idea how to predict how many NYTimes readers will follow the link, especially readers not reading online, but I am really, really curious.  NOTE 2: I'm sort of heartened by the fact that one person there, who was *clearly* trying to impress the NY Times reporter, and went so far as to pass her a note -- and he actually runs a real business that does stuff, so it might have been legitimate to quote him -- is not mentioned in the article.  Good for Julie Flaherty!

      I don't know what's up with all of these short posts today.  Anyway.  Today is admitted students day here.  I sat at a table for the a cappella group and talked to about 4 potential students who sing.  I wasn't particularly energetic.  Kind of sleepy and unengaged, I don't know.  There are people better at acting excited than I am.  Anyway, it was cool to see lots of people milling around who will soon start law school.  If any prospective Harvard students have stumbled on here and have any questions, I'm happy to answer them as best I can without making things up and pretending that if you got into Harvard and Yale you should obviously choose Harvard, because I really don't know which one you should choose, whether it matters, why it would matter, and what's different there.  urlLink e-mail

      In some sort of weird cosmic coincidence, my grandmother went to see some show today and found herself sitting next to a friend of one of my friends.  I actually don't find it at all strange that they were able to figure out this connection, because my grandmother is blessed with the awesome ability to engage strangers in conversation and immediately make a new friend.  Amazing.

      Thought of the day: the first between Westlaw and Lexis to include a selection of pornography in their online databases will be the one that breaks out of the fierce competition between the two of them and conquer the market.

      Random but interesting: my Harvard classmate  urlLink Ory  has a post about "mitumba," used clothing in Kenya.  Her blog is called "Kenyan Pundit," and probably should have gotten a link from me a while ago.

      The Jewish Law Students Association Boat Cruise I went on last night was fun.  I made the observation that one song the DJ on a boat would do well to avoid playing is the theme from "Titanic."  Although the weather, unusually for Boston, was nothing approaching iceberg weather.  I suppose icebergs are big enough they don't just melt on the first day it's warm though.

      For more on BloggerCon (see my post below for what the heck I'm talking about) -- see  urlLink BuzzMachine , which is the blog of Jeff Jarvis, who facilitated the session on "blogging as business," and, despite my skepticism about the prevailing wisdom of the room, I thought he did a marvelous job moderating and engaging and making the session the most interesting one I sat in on.

      Usually the lack of posts all day means that I've had nothing to say.  But today I've actually been away from my room, attending a couple of the sessions at  urlLink BloggerCon , a conference of bloggers (I know, that sounds soooo dorky) hosted by the Berkman Center here at Harvard.  It was free -- otherwise it would have really been a Blogger Con -- and I didn't pre-register, so I didn't get a cool nametag that labeled me as being a person who decided to spend a bit this beautiful Saturday sitting in classrooms listening to people talk about how weblogs are transforming the universe.  But I got to meet a few people I hadn't met before (if I was trying to be slick, I would link each word of 'a few people' to the site of a different person I met, but I'm not, so I won't).  Including  urlLink Scheherazade , who I've linked to a bunch and is even cooler in person that on her site.  And  urlLink TPB , a divorce lawyer from New Jersey, who I've never linked to before, but who was also nice to meet.  I also met a couple of other people, but no one else whose sites I've ever read, so they don't get links.  :)  Although I'm probably going to browse through the list of attendees on the BloggerCon site (I'm not there -- in case you're looking -- because I didn't register) and see if the people who came off during the conference sessions as articulate and interesting also come off that way on their weblogs -- and -- of course -- the inverse.  Which is more fun.  I'll link to anything particularly amusing I find.  What struck me overall about the conference was how weighted the audience was toward adults.  I say adults because I think of myself as a 12-year-old, but I mean people in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s.  And people who don't do what I do -- who don't just write some stuff about their lives and hope it's interesting and try to build up a readership.  It was people on the technology end of things -- using blogs in their workplaces, programming new blog tools, making new blog applications, selling blog ads, aggregating blogs into communities of blogosphomy (I'm making up that word, but I like it), and people (trying to be) on the business end of things -- wanting to either "use" blogs in their businesses to help achieve some other goal, like more sales, or more customer feedback.  Or people who want to make money as a full-time blogger, who want to sell ads on their blog, and sell subscriptions, and migrate their blogs to paying hosts.  Basically, people who saw blogs certainly not as just a cool thing to do, and not even just as a means to an end (like the magic wish that a writer for the Daily Show will stumble on my site and hire me to write for them), but as an industry that they wanted to make their business.    I don't think I buy this.  And here's why.  It's very clear to me why having a weblog is rewarding.  It's very clear to me why someone might want to make money with one.  But to jump from there directly to trying to form a trade organization (which was one idea that got a bunch of talk), or trying to standardize ad sizes, or counters, or get group health insurance -- it seems to ignore the crucial question.  What are blogs providing that people would legitimately want to pay for?  In business, I imagine they're a hindrance more than a help.  Reading and writing takes time.  As a replacement for an internal message board, fine.  As a new consumer helpline, fine.  But these aren't new paradigms, they're just a new form for old stuff and not providing any huge new killer value.  Not in business, it's a substitute, in most cases, for specialized magazines and newspapers.  There was talk in one session about "competing" with old media, like the New York Times and ABC News.  Come on.  Those organizations have infrastructure, have capital, and -- I think most important -- have credibility.  Blogs -- not even the biggest ones -- aren't competing with the New York Times.  They're competing with fringe magazines and journals for people's "extra" attention -- maybe.  Like I might read some weblogs instead of reading the Utne Reader (I have never read the Utne Reader, but my 11th grade English teacher did, and so I assume it's some high-brow literary publication -- if it's not, and if it's offensive in some way to anyone, I apologize, and please sub in "The Weekly Standard" instead, which may actually be offensive to more people), if I find weblogs that are good enough.  Maybe.  Maybe that's the attention base.  Maybe I'd pay $30 a year total to have access to every weblog I read.  Not if I was paying for Internet access in the first place though.  www.democratsrule.com is not replacing the New York Times.  www.ihatepepsi.com is not replacing Consumer Reports.  At least not now.  And not unless people start their thinking at the level of making killer content instead of coming up with killer ways to make money with Amazon's referrer program and ad clickthroughs.  At least I don't think so.  Then again, when I was 12 I predicted computers would never last.  So what do I know.   I love the New York Times.  The New York Times has survived radio, TV, and the Internet.   urlLink Instapundit  is not replacing the New York Times anytime soon.  I'll have more on the conference later -- especially if anyone links to this post and responds.  In the meantime, I'm off to the Jewish Law Students Boat Cruise, which I'll also post about later.  Nice day for it, at least.

      I posted this over at  urlLink De Novo  last night but figured it was funny enough to post here too.  :)  I read somewhere the other day that the Air America Network, the liberal radio network with Al Franken and Janeane Garofalo designed to compete with Rush Limbaugh and his fellow conservative radio talk show hosts, had missed some payments and was off the air in some big cities. The article also emphasized that Franken and his fellow hosts don't have much experience in radio and haven't been taking best advantage of the medium. I don't have a link for you. In fact, I only mention it because it gives me an excuse to try and be funny. Emphasis on "try."   The Air America Radio Network: Programming Schedule for Saturday April 17   6:00 AM -- "Liberal Morning," the show where radio personalities describe what they see as they watch the sun rise through a smog-filled sky made filthy by corporate polluters who get tax breaks. 8:00 AM -- Listen to a man who looks like George Bush get pies thrown at him. 9:00 AM -- Hear the sounds of endangered species over the radio dial for an hour. 10:00 AM -- Game Show: Who's More Liberal, with Ted Kennedy and Dennis Kucinich 11:00 AM -- Yelling at Republicans Noon -- "Lunchtime on the Streets," the show where poor people complain that they have no food because the Republicans don't care about them. 1:00 PM -- Three hours of reminiscing about how wonderful Jimmy Carter was. 4:00 PM -- "The day the Republicans ended the world," a radio drama featuring the voices of Barbra Streisand and James Brolin. 6:00 PM -- "You may be eating dinner, but only if you're rich." 7:00 PM -- One hour of reflection: this week, we'll be listening for an hour to a tape of Michael Moore snoring. 8:00 PM -- Listen to someone throwing darts at pictures of Dick Cheney 9:00 PM -- Alternative Family storytime. 11:00 PM -- Obscenity, because the first amendment still exists. For now.

      It's about 4 weeks until my first exam, which is when my Four Week Exam Plan gets started.  Here's how it goes:  Day 1: Organize notes.  Make sure I'm not missing any.  Look under my bed if any are missing.  Shake hard drive.  Check garbage pail.  Ask friends for copies of theirs.  Try not to lose them too. Day 2: Get some outlines off the Internet.  Feel productive while downloading lots of stuff I'm never going to read. Day 3: Sneak into journals office late at night and print outlines for free.  Never tell anyone I do this.  Oops. Day 4: Go to bookstore.  Look at study guides.  Memorize without buying.  Go back five minutes later, ashamed of myself, and buy study guides.  Feel bad for the rest of the day. Day 5: Pick a treatise, get it from the library, and pretend to read it cover to cover. Day 6: Print out every practice exam I can find and will never actually do.  Feel productive while stapling them. Day 7: Condense notes into an outline.  Get tired on page 3.  Use outline I downloaded instead.  Feel productive while going through downloaded outline line by line correcting typos. Day 8: Catch up on reading for semester. Day 9: Look for notes I lost since Day 1 when I had them all neatly in a pile. Day 10: Go to professor's office hours hoping to extract clue about exam questions.  Fail miserably, but feel productive for having tried. Day 11: Restaple stuff. Day 12: Read another treatise. Day 13: Do a practice exam.  Convince myself that if I had a model answer to look at, mine would be just as good. Day 14: Try the outline thing again.  This time get to page 8.  Decide you really want to have a small outline.  50 words or less.  Feel productive for making a completely useless 50-word outline. Day 15: Pretend I don't have an exam in less than two weeks.  Read US Weekly, TV Guide, or something else really vapid. Day 16: Wake up refreshed after a day off.  Realize how good that felt.  Take another day off. Day 17: Two practice exams.  Compare answers with the dumbest friend I can find.  Feel satisfied I'm not as dumb as he is. Day 18: Make some new outlines.  Fail miserably. Day 19: Read the outlines I downloaded, and the commercial study guides I shamefully purchased.  Convince myself I know this stuff. Day 20: Re-read the outlines.  Realize nothing stuck.  Bang head against wall. Day 21: E-mail friends at other law schools for their outlines, just for the heck of it.  Print them out and immediately throw them away. Day 22: Practice exam and interminable session with smart friends where we go over answers.  Feel satisfied I'll have a happier life than they will. Day 23: Lots of sleep.  For no particular reason. Day 24: Catch up on American Idol recaps on the Internet. Day 25: Final attempt to make useful outline.  Sort of helps.  Feel productive. Day 26: Last practice exam. Day 27: Lots of Vitamin C. Day 28: Take exam.  Cry myself to sleep.

      One of my friends and fellow law students here has my eternal gratitude for something very, very small, but very, very important.  I've written (once) before (a long time ago) about the sad state of the little red mouse nub in the middle of my laptop keyboard.  While I use a "normal" mouse (I don't know what that means, but it's a normal mouse, like it fits in the palm of my hand and rolls around) when I'm home, during class I'm forced to use the little eraser-like nub to make the cursor move.  And, for about the past year or so (my laptop's almost 4 years old... actually, its birthday is coming up in just two months... I should get it something special, like a CD burner), my red mouse nub has becoming more and more fragile.  No, fragile is too polite.  Destroyed.  It had a little rip, which became a bigger rip, which became quite a decent-sized tear.  And the fuzzy surface on top wore down to be smooth and shiny.  Making it hard to get rolling.  And making the thing pop off the laptop once a class or so, and make me scramble around on the floor to find it.  Fun stuff.  Anyway, my friend had an extra one, from a time when he had to order one for his laptop and they came in a pack of thirty or something unnecessary like that.  And now I have a brand new gray mouse nub, and, despite its lack of color, it's very lovely.

      A discussion in tax class yesterday and today about how if people (like OJ Simpson's neighbors, who actually litigated this) live in a house near a high-profile murder than causes their property value to fall, does that count a "casualty loss" defined as stuff like fire, flood, tornado.  (The answer: no)  But we learned in class that two people's parents live in or near houses or apartments that were once the sites of murders.  Fun.  Other things that cause property values to fall but are probably not casualty losses:  Loud dogs Ugly plants Ugly dogs Loud plants Unseasonably cold temperatures Lingering manure smell from nearby stables Surly mailman Lousy school system Nuclear war

       Jesse Ventura Speaks At the Law School   Here's most of an article I'll have in the law school paper this week about a brown-bag lunch today with former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura.  He was a pretty interesting guy.  I tell the truth, said former professional wrestler and Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura, at the start of his brown-bag lunch with members of the Committee on Sports and Entertainment Law (CSEL) on Tuesday.  Ventura briefly discussed his career and then spent almost 90 minutes fielding a variety of questions from students, in a freewheeling discussion that touched on subjects as diverse and controversial as steroid use in professional sports, the California recall election, his wrestling career, President Bush, organized religion, the second amendment, and his current experience as a resident scholar at the Kennedy School of Government.  People tell me wrestling is fake  I take offense to that, Ventura said.  We put our bodies on the line.  If something goes wrong and someone gets paralyzed, thats not fake.  He explained that during halftime at professional basketball games, sometimes a man on a trampoline will come out to perform, and hes called an artist.  But Id like to see the trampoline artist miss the trampoline and land on the floor and then well see how much of an artist he is.  Ventura said that for thirty years wrestling has been the third largest spectator sport behind NASCAR and horse racing, and horse racing only because you can bet.  In part, he said the popularity can be explained because wrestling is year-round.  The NBA gets three months off we dont take off for the summer.    About professional wrestling, he said that only the finishes were planned out, but everything else in the ring was ad-libbed.  In noisy arenas, he said, you could whisper the next moves to your opponent.  Above all, protect your opponents body like its yours.  Because of the grueling schedule, wrestlers, he acknowledged, have been particularly prone to using steroids and other drugs.  Ventura said something like 57 pro wrestlers have died before age 52  well-trained athletes, and he blames the early deaths largely on drugs.  People live for the now, the glory, no one knew the long-term problems and now you see wrestlers dropping dead, Ventura said.  He doesnt believe the problem can ever be solved: the steroids are always one step ahead of the testing [like] human growth hormone stuff where they turn you into chimpanzees.  He acknowledged he tried testosterone a few times.  [Steroids] do work.  I was bench pressing 315 pounds and within 30 days I was up to 390 Testosterone is the one steroid your wifell remind you to take because your sexual prowess goes up strongly, he said.  Ventura criticized those who say Ralph Nader ought not run for President.  Nobody owns your vote.  This nonsense that he spoiled the election Gore didnt win in his home state.  [Or] if he had won Bill Clintons Arkansas, he would have won the election And that idiotic electoral college.  It served its purpose long ago.  How can [Gore] get 500,000 more votes and lose? Ventura asked.    He said he initially thought the Reform Party would grow into a legitimate third party, but Ross Perot, he had it, he killed it, its sad its about Ross Perot and his ego when I won [in Minnesota] he hated me because I took publicity from Perot.  About the current election, he said the difference between Bush and Kerry is like Coke and Pepsi and both have been paid off by the same lobbyists anyway.  Will someone tell me how the President creates jobs without expanding government? he asked.  Im gonna create three million jobs, they say  well, name me one.  He said if he was running he would attack Bush for not being a conservative when it comes to economics since Bush has grown government spending by more than 20%.  Ventura called the California recall election a complete misuse [It] made a signature more powerful than a vote.  How hard is it to get any idiot in a shopping mall to sign on a line?  He asked, How many Californians are here?  You should be ashamed.  He recalled that reporters would ask him how he felt about Arnold Schwarzenegger doing what he had done, and he would say, Arnolds not doing what I did.  I ran in a real election against two endorsed candidates and beat them, not this recall nonsense.  He talked about kids today and tattoos: Dont they realize its permanent?  I cant believe how kids tattoo themselves like that. Wait until your kids say, mom, dad, whats up with that?  Asked about his varied career, Ventura said, I havent embraced the concept of reincarnation until I do, Im going to do everything possible on this planet.  I get bored.  I want to try something new. This summer, Im going to do nothing.  Fish, golf, drive my new Porsche.  It cost me more than my first two houses.  Finally, Ventura was asked about his time at the Kennedy School.  Theres nothing more gratifying than to pass on your knowledge to the next generation, he said.  I did the Hasty Pudding Show and it was the first time I ever dressed in drag.  I dont know where they get those size 13 heels.  They said a transvestite store.

       Fire Alarm   I was in class this afternoon and the fire alarm rings.  It was a siren sound, a few times, and some lights flashing.  And then the siren stops, and an automated voice comes in over the loudspeaker.  If this was a real emergency (it turned out to -- apparently -- be nothing, although they evacuated the building, firemen came, but ten minutes later we were all back inside), we'd all be fried, because we'd still be listening to the long-winded automated emergency voice.  Which said -- and I think I'm only barely exaggerating:   The sound you just heard indicated the emergency response system has activated.  Following this brief message, the alarms will sound again.  You should calmly pack up your things, grab all of your belongings, and slowly exit the building through the nearest door in an orderly fashion.  Once the emergency situation has been resolved, the alarms will stop sounding, and you will be allowed back into the building.  Please follow the instructions of the emergency personnell, as they will instruct you on the proper steps to take once you have calmly and carefully exited the building.  Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.  We hope to resolve the situation as quickly as possible.  Watch your step.  Happy Holidays.  God Bless America. OK, the last part was an exaggeration.  But, come on, we all know what a fire alarm means.  "Get out of the building.  Now."  If they must have an automated voice, that's all it needs to say.  I know professors are paid by the word, but fire alarms??

       Westlaw Training Session: Prepare to Practice   The firm I'll be working for this summer (as well as every other firm in the world, it seems, so nothing unusual) asked its summer associates to take an hour of Westlaw and Lexis training at school sometime before the end of the year.  My Lexis training is scheduled for next week, but I just finished the Westlaw one, and thought I'd report.  People completely in the dark: Westlaw and Lexis are competing legal research databases.  They are virtually identical except one uses quotation marks to denote a phrase and the other assumes the quotation marks even if you don't put them in.  They're free to law students but expensive to law firms, so they want to get you "hooked" (as opposed to going to actual books and searching by hand) so they make lots of money from firms.  But: most firms actually pay a flat fee, so your searches don't cost them *added* money -- BUT the way they bill their clients is to tell them what it would have cost if not for the flat fee... so, since clients don't like seeing big "legal research" tabs on their bill, the encouragement is to keep the cost down... BUT, since it seems that the firms turn a profit on this stuff, I can't imagine they want you to keep the cost down too much.  Clearly, I'm a little confused on the motivations and incentive structure here.  Nevertheless, I take at face value that the point of the training session was to teach us how to save money on Westlaw, but not so much money that Westlaw still doesn't make a huge amount of money, and inspire your loyalty so the firm continues to pay the flat fee, which approaches three zillion dollars a year.  Things I learned from the Westlaw representative teaching the class: *You can either select to have your research charged by the minute, or by the transaction. *If you select, by the minute, you pay approximately (all of these numbers are approximate, she said) 80 cents a minute for doing nothing.  You then pay an added fee on top of that whenever you're in a particular database -- so "all Federal cases" would be $8.75/minute, but a smaller database like "all Massachusetts" might just be $4.00/minute. *Hearing about these insane per-minute charges may make you want to be billed by transaction.  Ha.  The federal database will cost about $75.00/search, but the Massachusetts "only" about $35.00 per search.  "So choose the smallest database possible." *If you deign to print a document off of Westlaw, you will be charged 3 cents per line, or $5.50 per document, your choice.  So start counting lines.  Or just cut and paste into Word and they'll never know. *A few things are free.  Their help line, 1-800-REF-ATTY (which, with the dash moved just one space over, is 1-800-RE-FATTY, which is funnier) is free.  Also apparently if you are not logged into Westlaw and not searching, there is no "you are not using us now" surcharge. *Anytime you click on anything blue (that's what she said, I don't know), it's $5.50.  That means cases and stuff. *Linking from a table of contents, also $5.50. *Each KeyCite citation is $4.75, but in the per-minute pricing it's $4.50 a minute, so make your choice wisely. *Accessing your research history is free.  In the session, we went through a "sample case" about someone being deported after conviction of a felony.  I wonder if the felony was stealing legal research.

      In Communications Law today we talked about the government classifying programs as children's educational programming based on spurious justifications -- e.g., this cartoon teaches kids to stay away from dragons.  I thought I'd offer some justifications for some popular current TV shows.   Justifications For Classifying Some of Today's Most Popular TV Shows as Children's Educational Programming   ER: 1. Teaches kids that doctors are helpful. 2. Shows kids why they shouldn't do anything risky, since risky things may lead to accidents, which may lead to hospital trips, which will certainly lead to fire, plague, famine, blackout, earthquake, helicopter crashes, AIDS infection, unwanted pregnancy, or other desperate moves to increase ratings. 3. Helps child learn useful medical jargon.  American Idol: 1. Teaches kids that British people are mean. 2. Shows kids that the best way to get adults to pay attention to them is if they sing annoying pop sounds slightly off-key, week after week after week. 3. Demonstrates that the key to success isn't education and hard work, but being naturally blessed with a good voice and telegenic personality.  Friends: 1. Teaches kids that having friends is good. 2. Counteracts the myth that New York apartments are very small and prohibitively expensive. 3. Imparts the lesson that the best kind of people are pretty people.  Queer Eye For The Straight Guy: 1. Shows kids that gay people are different from everyone else. 2. Illustrates how quick and easy it is to remodel an entire house. 3. Teaches kids that sometimes even marginal cable networks can produce a show with media buzz.  The Local News: 1. Teaches kids to lock their doors. 2. Shows kids that there's lots of crime right in their neighborhood. 3. Demonstrates the necessity of guns for self-defense purposes.

       Debunking Course Selection Myths   1. The more words in the course name, the more interesting the class.  I know you've heard this one.  Everyone always says to look for the classes with the long names.  Forget "Copyright" (1 word) -- what you really want to take are "Citizenship, Multiculturalism, Identity and Human Rights" (6 words), "Contemporary Islamic Legal Thought: Law, State, and World Order" (9 words), "Comparative Corporate Law and Governance: Germany, Switzerland, the U.S., and the U.K." (12 words), and "Human Rights, State Sovereignty, and Persecution: Issues in Forced Migration and Refugee Protection" (27 words).  2. Legal research classes are awesome.  Compare these excerpts from descriptions of two different courses:  (A) "The emphasis will be placed on understanding the role of race, ethnicity, disability, socio-economic status, gender, language, immigrant status, and other important student characteristics in the development of education policy and practice."  (B) "Emphasis will be placed on contemporary developments, such as the new Lexis headnotes feature."  I think that pretty much speaks for itself.  3. All of the required professional responsibility classes are the same.  (A) "The casebook will be Kaufman and Wilkins, Problems in Professional Responsibility (4th ed., 2002). Students should also have one of the Professional Responsibility standards handbooks, such as the current Dzienkowski edition"  (B) "The materials will be Kaufman and Wilkins, Problems in Professional Responsibility for a Changing Profession(4th ed. 2002) and Professional Responsibility Standards, Rules & Statutes (Dzienkowski ed. latest ed.)."  (C) "We will use Kaufman and Wilkins, Problems in Professional Responsibility for a Changing Profession(4th ed. 2002) and Selected Standards on Professional Responsibility (Morgan & Rotunda latest edition)."  See, that third one is hugely different.  Apparently Mr. Dzienkowski did something to make professor C want to use a competitor's statute book.  Or maybe the professor just couldn't remember how to spell his name.  4. Take Evidence.  Because every lawyer should know Evidence.  Well, why the heck shouldn't every lawyer know Pottery?  If you've gone through interviews, you surely noticed how boring all of the lawyers you encountered were.  These people are boring because they took all of these required classes.  They didn't take Art Law.  I mean, they wanted to, but they couldn't get in.  So they took the stuff everyone "recommends" and became dry, boring people without interests outside the law.  Cross-register.  Drop out.  Become a sculptor.  Don't take Evidence.  (I don't mean to pick on Evidence.  You can substitute anything in its place.  Don't want to make any Evidence professors mad at me.  They know how to kill me and not get caught.  Evidence.  Get it?  Yeah, me neither.)  5. The best classes meet on Friday afternoons.  Everyone's always trying to get Friday afternoon classes, but don't fall into that trap.  You don't want to choose classes just based on when they meet.  You want to choose them based on what the grade distribution will look like and whether or not there's a final exam.  Don't be part of the herd racing to take Friday afternoon classes.  It won't be worth it.  6. Take classes you'll need for the Bar Exam.  Because everyone fails the bar exam unless they've taken all the relevant classes.  Come on.  Everyone is smart enough to learn Evidence (sorry to keep picking on Evidence) from a book, or, if you take Bar/Bri, from a sixteen-hour videotape we'll watch in a high school classroom with fifty other students whose firms are paying thousands of dollars for us to watch TV for six weeks.  You only need to worry about the bar exam after you fail it the first three times and your firm is about to crucify you (an appropriate metaphor for me to use on Easter, right?  I was hoping to get the word 'crucify' in here somewhere).  7. No one should graduate from law school without taking classes from the worst professors at the law school.  That's what everyone always says.  "You'll love the worst professors -- no matter what they teach it's always... horrible."  A bad professor can ruin an interesting topic.  A good professor can make a boring topic come alive.  But, as it seems, most professors split the electorate.  "He's great," "She's terrible," "He's boring," "She's fascinating," might be the four comments you hear about the average transgendered professor.  So how can you tell?  Well, back to the conventional wisdom: listen to the people whose opinions you trust the least.   8. Follow your heart.  This is a myth.  If we followed our heart, we'd be in cooking school / art school / writing the Great American Novel.  Follow your brain.  It's what got you to law school.  Look, few if any classes are truly terrible, and it's impossible to really know what the great ones are because they're different for everyone.  So I choose based on the free promotional materials each professor sends to induce students to sign up for their classes.  What?  You didn't get the yo-yo?

      A few weeks ago,  urlLink Howard Bashman  (I'm not motivated enough to go find the actual post, but it's there) wrote about watching "Shattered Glass" on DVD and enjoying it.   urlLink Chris Geidner  (again, not motivated to find the post -- and in this case it may have been in an e-mail, but he gets a link anyway) had similar thoughts.  And some other blogger who I unfortunately just can't recall wrote that he usually doesn't watch director's commentaries on these things, but the "Shattered Glass" one was awesome.  I saw the movie, and loved it (you can find my brief thoughts somewhere below, when I linked to Howard's post initially) -- and really wanted to watch the director's commentary.  My mom got me a DVD player for Hanukkah in December -- I told her to get literally the cheapest one she could find, this one was like 35 bucks and looks more like a George Foreman Grill than a DVD player -- it's blue and plastic and just extraordinarily cheap-looking, but it totally works and that's all that matters -- and I only own 3 DVDs, the sketch show Mr. Show (Seasons 1 & 2, although 3 &4 are on my Wish List -- if I ever finish watching 1 & 2), The Ben Stiller Show, which I got for a few bucks on Half.com, and a James Taylor live concert, which I also got for a few bucks on Half.com.  I rented a couple of DVDs last summer when I was subletting a place in Washington for a few weeks, and the guy had a DVD player.  But, anyway, the point here is that the number of DVD movies and director's commentaries I've seen is about three -- Wet Hot American Summer (great movie: go rent it), Sweet Home Alabama (not a great movie: don't go rent it), and Rodger Dodger (also not a great movie: and a pretty useless director's commentary) -- but I'm completely enthralled with the *notion* of director's commentaries and how cool they *should be*.    Anyway, reading the blog posts about Shattered Glass made me want to rent it and watch the director's commentary, even though I've seen the movie.  So I signed up for a membership with a video store right near here (this is how many movies I rent -- I have no membership to anything... well, I have a Blockbuster card, but I've never been to the Blockbuster around here, although I do know where it is and suppose, now that I think about it, I just could have walked the extra 3 blocks, since I was going in that direction anyway...) just to rent Shattered Glass to watch the director's commentary.  I'm 6 minutes in.  It's really good.    That was the entire point of this endless post.  "I'm 6 minutes in.  It's really good."  Why am I watching this at 9 AM on Sunday?  Because if I don't watch it now, it's not going to get watched and the DVD will be due.  Why did it take me three paragraphs to get to the point?  I don't know.  UPDATE: I'm 16 minutes in.  It's *still* really good.  What's cool is that the director is commenting, along with Chuck Lane, who was head of The New Republic and is a character in the movie, and has insight into what's real and what's fictional.  The totally weird thing is that these two people seem so genuine and so decent that listening to them talk about this movie is really cool.  I think this was the director's first film.  Cool stuff.  UPDATE 2: The rest is good too.  A nice sense of how a movie gets made, really worth watching/listening to.  Great commentary on top of a great movie.  I have nothing but praise.

       urlLink Waddling Thunder  writes about professor evalutions.  He actually writes something serious about them.  I, on the other hand, will not.  Thus:   Proposal for New Law Professor Evaluation Form   On a scale of 1 to 5, rank the professor's ability to...  ...Control the lights and window shades with the appropriate switches and dials ...Wear a microphone without causing either feedback or fire ...Make the audiovisual equipment work within the class session it was intended to be used ...Learn student names ...At least fake it by glancing quickly at the seating chart instead of repeatedly calling on students by the wrong name ...Keep track of hypotheticals posed ...Pretend he has not given the lecture twenty-seven times previous ...Notice when a student has raised his hand ...Keep the class awake ...Cover each session's assigned reading in that session ...Deliver pre-prepared jokes so as to produce genuine laughter ...Drop hints about exam questions veiled enough so that the students paying no attention miss them but not so much that the students really paying attention don't ...Notice which students are playing solitaire and calling on them repeatedly for the amusement of the rest of the class ...Bully the gunners into acting civil and polite ...Admit when he does not know the answer to something ...Prepare for class enough that he doesn't know the answer relatively infrequently ...Answer the question asked, and not the question he thought was being asked when he interrupted the student halfway through ...End class on time ...Provide enough time to fill out the professor evaluations

      I posted this on  urlLink De Novo  last week, but I've received two e-mails about it, so I figured I should post it here too:   The Real World, Lawyer Style    urlLink Variety reports  that Fox has a new reality show in the works -- all about lawyers!   [Fox] has given a eight-to-10-episode production commitment to the tentatively titled "The Partner," an hourlong skein in which a group of newly minted lawyers will battle each other to win a job as a partner in a major law firm...  Contestants will be divided into two teams -- one made up of Ivy League grads, the other consisting of players who attended less prestigious schools. Each week, teams will compete by serving as prosecutors or defenders in mock trials inspired by actual cases. A jury of real people -- selected by the lawyers/contestants -- will determine the winner of each trial...  Fox and Rocket Science are in talks with several well-known lawyers about coming on board to serve in the Trump-like role as judge. Talks are also under way with several law firms about serving as the sponsoring firm for the show. Lawyers from the chosen firm will act as advisers to the two teams...  "Lawyers are so verbose, so opinionated and want to be on camera," [exec producer] Darnell said.    1. Lawyers, quick!  Get your resumes into Fox before Johnnie Cochran gets there first!  2. The winner gets to become a  partner ??  Right away??  Is there any reputable law firm that would agree to that?  How much partner-level work can this recent grad do, no matter how talented he or she is?  No experience, no connections... and imagine the terrible press within the legal industry. "Yeah, they have that partner... from the reality show."  That makes you sound really classy.  3. I can tell from that last quote that this show plans to go a long way to correct stereotypes about lawyers... right....

      New reality show on Fox: "The Elephant" -- 12 average-looking men and women are subjected to three months of intense body transformation.  They undergo radical plastic surgery, have all of their bones broken and fused back together again, have their teeth straightened, bleached, and veneered, have their hair removed and replaced, have their skin peeled off layer by layer, purified in a centrifuge, and replaced, and, most importantly, have their genetic code modified.  When the procedures are completed, the transformations will be revealed.  The 12 average-looking men and women will have been transformed into... elephants.  Real, live, big gray elephants with long trunks and big feet.  The elephants will then compete for cash and prizes in a truck-pulling competition that will be televised live -- by cameramen who will stand on a thin wire connecting two New York skyscrapers -- with no net, no clamps, and no margin for error.  On a windy, rainy day.  Blindfolded.  With live worms crawling all over their bodies.  These worms: will compete in a singing competition, judged by music legends Olivia Newton-John, Gladys Knight, and Rupert Holmes.  The judges will wear masks covering their faces, and their identities will have to be guessed -- by the sixteen bachelors carefully selected from a pool of twelve thousand applicants.  The bachelors will put our judges to the test -- while they themselves compete in the ultimate competition for survival, stranded on an ice floe in the middle of the Arctic Ocean, with no water, no food, and no thumbs, after they undergo a radical procedure perfected in Ancient Egypt.  The bachelors on the ice floes will encounter a tribe of penguins -- who all live in one house, with cameras following their every move, as they stop being penguins, and start being real.  The raw footage of the penguins' lives will be broadcast on the Internet, and viewers will have the opportunity to e-mail the penguins with instructions about what to do next.  One special female viewer will be chosen at random to join the penguins in their Arctic home -- and will participate in the ultimate practical joke.  She will have to convince her family that she has fallen in love with the penguin, and will be married at a wedding ceremony next week.  If her family attends the wedding, she will win the right to work as Donald Trump's secretary for one year, at a salary of $15,000.  If her family does not attend the wedding, they will be dropped from a helicopter, eight hundred miles above the Earth's surface, for a reality show experience like none before: "Eight Hundred Miles Above The Earth," a twenty-second chronicle of the family's adventure falling to the surface, with no parachutes, no food, and just one music CD each.  Those CDs will be featured on a special VH1 original program, "Favorite CDs of the Family Falling To Earth," and celebrities like Damon Wayans and the Budweiser Frogs will comment on each track.  The artists responsible for the CDs will be reunited for one final concert, live from Madison Square Garden in New York City, where they will serve as the opening act for the ultimate elephant truck-pulling event.  "The Elephant."  This fall on Fox.

      Oh, wow.   urlLink Scheherazade  has a great post on the advantages of being at an Ivy League school (in a nutshell: you meet people who will go on to do awesome things, and you realize those people are normal people, just like you, and if they can do great things, so can you), on which I place only one caveat.  People from everywhere go on to do great things, and I think her post really can apply to anyone who goes to college and gets to know people.  I actually realized it more here at law school than in undergrad -- and I'm sure it'll become even clearer after a few more years out when my classmates start doing cool stuff.  But I got here, and encountered some impressive people -- I'm actually probably talking more about my professors than my fellow students at this point, although of course lots of my classmates have already done cool stuff and many more will go on to do all sorts of astonishing things -- and realized they all started where I am now, and that really there are all sorts of possibilities in the world, and doors are there to be opened, not closed.  (Of course, sometimes I find myself thinking about people my age who've already accomplished more than I have, and I start to think that people are getting ahead of me, and doors are closing, and I'm losing some sort of race I didn't realize I was in, and I'm running out of time to really do something important... and then I take a deep breath and decide I need a nice long nap.)

      Today, the April Fools edition of the  urlLink law school newspaper  comes out.  (We were on Spring Break last week, so we decided to ignore the calendar and do it this week, since April Fools stories are a lot more fun to write -- and read -- than real stories.)  So, pasted below (and in a set of posts below this one) are my contributions to the issue, but I've edited them to make sense to non-Harvard readers... so even if you don't know we had an ice rink in the middle of campus (we did), you'll still get it.  Maybe.   Ice Rink Stolen!   Field full of ice mysteriously vanishes  in the middle of daylight!   Dean of Harvard Law School Elena Kagan held a tearful press conference this week to inform the law school community that the Jarvis Field Ice Rink, built over the winter as a morale-booster for cold Massachusetts law students, and which incurred construction costs that forced the law school to completely eliminate the financial aid program, has mysteriously vanished.    According to the police report, at some point between ten in the morning and three in the afternoon, on an unseasonably warm day in early March, the ice rink simply disappeared.  The security cameras, which had been set up in the expectation that someone might want to steal the ice rink, and incurred a cost that forced the law school to fire three librarians, showed no signs of forced entry, but it is believed that the gate may have accidentally been left open for the thieves to enter.   Witnesses who saw the theft from their dormitory windows say they saw a suspicious band of students approach the ice rink with funny-looking shoes, perhaps casing the joint, according to one 2L who wished to remain anonymous for fear of retribution by the thieves.    Apparently to cover their footprints, the bandits left a large puddle of water where the ice rink used to be. According to an emotional Dean Kagan, I never thought this would happen.  I thought the ice rink would be here forever.   Dean Kagan has announced plans for a memorial service to commemorate the short but glorious life of the Ice Rink.  A recently-completed study on the history of ice rinks at American law schools will be presented (also the subject of a seminar next spring), and a portrait of the ice rink to hang in the student center will be unveiled.  A committee has been formed to compile a report on the impact the ice rinks disappearance will have on the law school community at large; a discussion will take place next week among several members of the faculty regarding the ice rink and its legacy.    Like the school did last year after we began the war in Iraq, the Dean has announced that cookies and milk will be made available in the student dining hall for students particularly affected by the ice rinks disappearance, and the room will be used as a place for solitary reflection on the incident and its aftermath.  The office of student counseling has also announced that its staff will be available for extra hours over the next few weeks to help students deal with the tragedy and the effects it has had on their lives.  The law firm of Skadden Arps has announced an Ice Rink Memorial Fellowship for 1Ls who wish to pursue legal careers related to the disappearance of ice rinks from law school campuses, and will pay a stipend of $1000/week to one 1L who writes a publishable-quality journal article on the issue.  Dean Kagan announced plans to create an endowed chair in memory of the Ice Rink; one professor will be appointed the Ice Rink Memorial Faculty Member in the fall, and begin teaching classes such as Frozen Water Law, and Professional Responsibility: Ice Rinks.  A new wing of the library (tentatively to be named the Detroit Red Wing) will be opened to devote itself entirely to books and journals related to ice rinks, Zamboni machines, and hockey masks.  Students will be asked to refrain from bringing any liquids into the room, although solidified liquids will be permitted, and dry ice will be provided to interested students at a nominal fee (chargeable to our Crimson Cash ID-card debit system, which will be renamed Clear and Frosty Cash in memory of the Ice Rink).  Students with any information about the ice rinks whereabouts should visit Dean Kagan during office hours, next Friday from 6:30 in the morning until 6:32.

       Dean Kagan announces Law School Easter Egg Hunt   Jarvis Field to be filled three feet deep with plastic grass   Following the unfortunate demise of the Jarvis Field Ice Rink (see Ice Rink Stolen! above), Dean Kagan announced today that the law school will turn Jarvis Field into the grounds of a massive Law School Easter Egg Hunt.  The Field will be filled three feet deep with plastic grass, and 1800 Cadbury Crme Eggs will be hidden inside, incurring a cost that will cause the law school to raise tuition by 15% next year.  Students will be invited to the Egg Hunt by section, along with section professors, who will join the students in digging through the plastic grass for the eggs.  I believe the Easter Egg Hunt will improve student morale tremendously, said a beaming Dean Kagan.  I have heard the clarion call that students want more out of law school, and this, I am certain, is exactly what they want.    Reports stolen from Dean Kagans office have uncovered that the Dean plans to turn Jarvis Field into a seasonal land of pleasure, which will be home to new projects for each major holiday.  For Thanksgiving, the Field will become a giant pen for turkeys to roam free, until Dining Services slaughters them for lunch.  For Memorial Day, the slain bodies of soldiers will be buried in the ground beneath in a moving and gratuitously expensive ceremony.  For Arbor Day, perhaps the most extraordinary plan of all: grass will be planted, and Jarvis Field will be turned back into a Field.  I am expecting student resistance to that one, said Kagan.    Other reports stolen indicate that, like on Law Review, there will not be affirmative action for women in the Easter Egg Hunt, and that even if no women find any Easter Eggs, none will be provided to them.  A coalition of three chickens and an egg (the egg came forward first, incidentally) sent the newspaper a top-secret letter outlining their dissatisfaction with Kagans position and imploring the student body to take a closer look at the Easter Egg Hunt results and demand action.  Data from peer law schools indicate that while at Harvard only 30% of all eggs in past hunts were found by women, at Columbia women found 54% of the eggs, at the University of Pennsylvania 48%, at Yale 62%, and at Barbaras Law School For Women, 100% of the Easter eggs were found by women.  The Committee on Eggs released a report this week saying that despite the suspicion that more eggs will be found by men than by women, because women have eggs inside of them and men have sperm, the overall differences will be negligible.  The report has been banned by the library for being particularly idiotic, leading Prof. Alan Dershowitz to speak out about the issue.  These students should not be silenced.  Even if theyre comparing Easter Eggs to other wholly unrelated eggs that are probably not painted with bright colors, and if they are I hope its not lead paint, because that harms children.  Dershowitz also insisted he did not plagiarize his speech, just because he felt like talking some more.  In addition to the Easter Egg Hunt, said Dershowitz, I demand Dean Kagan also hide matzoh in Jarvis Field for Jewish students to find.  After making this demand, he returned to his office to add an appendix to his latest book, The Case For Israel, regarding matzoh, and how it may be hidden somewhere in Israel, although he is not sure where.

       Three panelists commit suicide during Balancing Work and Life at a Big Firm careers forum   OCS was left with some explaining to do after three panelists at a careers forum on balancing work and life at a large firm committed suicide during the presentation.  It started like any other OCS event, with eight people in the audience and a panel full of indistinguishable lawyers wearing dark suits.  An OCS staffer began the panel by asking each attorney to describe a typical week.  The first attorney, a partner at Skadden, described how he spends pretty much all day and night at the office.  In fact, my wife just told me shes leaving me to go find someone who actually cares about having a family life.  She said my life is empty and meaningless, and, frankly, I agree.    To the shock of the six students still remaining in the audience, he then pulled  a rope from his pocket, tied it to a light fixture, made a noose, and hanged himself.  The OCS staffer then asked the same question to the second panelist, a partner at Wachtell.  I look at all four of you in the audience, he said, referencing the four students still in the audience, and see such young, smiling faces.  I remember when I was young.  Now Im old, and have nothing to live for because Ive wasted my life making rich people richer and buying expensive things from Williams-Sonoma and Pottery Barn that dont really make me happy.  He then dunked his head in the water pitcher on the table and didnt come up.  He turned blue and drowned.    The OCS staffer then asked the third panelist, a partner at Cravath, for her thoughts.  Well, being the only woman on the panel, I have a unique take on the issue.  I left work to have a child.  I returned three days later from my maternity leave an discovered that many of my colleagues had raced ahead in the drive toward partnership.  I immediately gave my child up for adoption, because I knew thats what I had to do.  My husband hated the decision when I told him about it later that day, but the child had already been signed away. A contract is a contract, I told him, even as he sobbed for an entire week.  Im a horrible person.  She then stabbed herself with the plastic knife shed been using to butter her bagel, and, to the horror of the two students remaining in the audience, bled to death.  The final panelist was a partner at Davis Polk.  Im perfectly happy with my life, he said.  I guess these other lawyers just dont have what he takes.  On his way out of the room, he stole the wallets from the pockets of each of the dead attorneys, and kicked the OCS staffer in the shin.

       After years of struggle, HLS finally increases employment rate above 100%   Director of Career Services: Weve Done It!   When the Director of Career Services took office in 1993, the Dean of the law school gave him two directives.  Number one, he recalls the Dean saying, move the entire career services library of books and brochures from a computer-based system to a paper-and-filing-cabinet approach, and Number two, increase the employment rate upon graduation.    The first goal took almost no time to achieve, as the new director and his staff took hammer to machine and destroyed banks of computers, putting all of the offices material in old file cabinets and haphazardly inside unmarked closets with no rhyme or reason.    But the second goal proved harder.  At the time of the directors appointment, the graduation employment rate was stuck at 100%, and had been for over seven decades.  To increase it, he would have to think outside the box, and achieve what no career services director had been able to achieve in the history of mankind.    He set to work.  His first step was to increase the number of law firms that came to campus to hire the 550 graduating students.  The number when he began his efforts was a mere 400 firms, each looking for an average of 3 Harvard students, meaning that there were only slightly more than double the potential jobs than available openings, a disappointing ratio that meant some students only got two or three offers.  He began an all-out push to increase the number of firms.    This year, a record 14,000 law firms came to campus to recruit, with each firm looking for an average of 37 Harvard Law students.  This meant that most students had upwards of a hundred offers, with one law review member remarking, I had forty-six hundred offers.  The mailman actually delivered my mail in a sack.  But one firm rejected me.  Theyre the one I really wanted to work for.  What good is being on Law Review when the one firm you really want to work for spurns you anyway?    But to reach beyond the 100% barrier, he had to do more than just increase the number of firms.  He also had to increase the number of candidates.  So, in an extraordinary move that will go down in the annals of career counseling history, He dressed up homeless people in suits and ties, armed them with OCS-approved resumes, and sent them to the interviews.  Improbably, the law firms were so desperate for Harvard students that 6,000 of them got hired (impacting the Harvard Square homeless population only negligibly), and increasing HLSs employment rate to more than 1000%.  For his efforts, the director will receive a free Cadbury Crme Egg (see Dean Kagan announces law school easter egg hunt, above).

       Former Dean burns himself with free coffee provided by New Dean, sues school   New Dean claims it was no accident   The former Dean, in his first return to the classroom since stepping down as Dean at the end of the 2002-03 school year, reached for a cup of free coffee during the 10-minute break he gave his students, and suffered third-degree burns on his fingers after the coffee dispenser apparently suffered a coffee malfunction, according to the police report.  The old Dean was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital, where, while under general anesthesia he reportedly said, This is what the new Dean gets for trying to upstage me.  She thinks she can waltz right in here and start giving away free coffee to students.  Well, Ill show her!  Ill show her that it takes more than free coffee.  Now Im going to sue the school for all its got  money I raised, mind you  and remind her whos really in charge.  Free coffee?  Bah!   The new Dean released a statement saying the incident was no accident and calling on the old Dean to admit that he rigged the coffee machine to leak, simply out of spite.  She also produced documents showing his plans to slip and fall on the ice rink, foiled only when she stepped in and destroyed the rink (cf. Ice Rink Stolen! above).  Hell never get away with this! she said.  Bah! he said.

       Renovated bathroom to be re-renovated   Responding to student complaints that the nicest facility on campus is the recently-renovated Pound Hall bathroom, the Committee on Superfluous Renovations issued a press release this week announcing that the bathroom will be re-renovated over the summer to make it look like every other bathroom on campus, dirty and old.  Last summer, we made the decision that if we could turn just one room on campus into a facility worthy of the most prestigious university on the planet, read the press release, it should be a bathroom.  In retrospect, perhaps it should have been a storage room.  Whoops.   Law school bookstore amends study guide returns policy: You Look, You Buy   The law school bookstore, long troubled by the problem of students attempting to return study guides and other supplementary materials that all other bookstores on the planet have no problem at all taking back, has decided to amend its already-retributivist no returns policy.  The new policy, according to the troll who lives under the bridge and runs the bookstore in his spare time, is pretty easy to understand.  If we catch you looking at a study guide, you buy it.  If you go so far as to actually touch it, you buy two.  No questions asked.  Weve actually been enforcing this policy for a few weeks now, by automatically debiting the amounts off of student accounts.  In response to a question about students browsing for the right study guide, and perhaps making eye contact with a dozen or two before finding the right one, the troll replied, Yes, well, then you buy them all.  This really isnt very difficult at all to understand.  The bookstore also announced a new buy-back policy for used books. It will now pay nothing at all.  This is considered to be only a marginal change from the old policy.  Were providing a great service simply by storing the books for students, the troll said.  They should pay us.  In fact, well be starting that policy next year, when we also charge students a fee to enter the store, regardless of whether they buy anything.

      Happy Second Night of Passover, to anyone who's reading this over a cold plate of matzoh and gefilte fish and hoping for happy holiday wishes.  Gefilte fish, incidentally, is an appetizer made of lots of fish, ground up and formed into fish balls, covered in what I can only assume is fish-flavored jelly, eaten with little tiny carrots and bright red radioactive horseradish.  Gefilte fish actually looks kind of like matzoh balls, except bigger and fishier.  One year my grandmother couldn't get her matzoh balls to be the right consistency ("These matzoh balls are too firm;" "These matzoh balls are too soft;" "These matzoh balls are just right") and made about a hundred of them and froze the "defects."  I joked with her that she should have given them out to the trick-or-treaters on Halloween.  Heck, it's better than pennies.  (This post was sponsored by the B'nai Brith, Anti-Defamation League, and the National Jewish Legal Defense Fund.)  Incidentally -- if anyone wants to send me a haiku about Passover, I'll post it.  I don't know why I've decided that could be fun.  UPDATE: Here's the best of the haiku I received.  From Madeline, who has a lovely weblog  urlLink here : I pray for freedom From matzoh constipation Next year buy whole wheat  From Michelle, who as far as I know doesn't have a weblog: Where is Elijah? He must be wasted by now. Let's give him grape juice.  [If anyone's looking for Equal Time, feel free to send me an Easter haiku.]  UPDATE 2:  urlLink Beanie  sends this Easter one:  I need a pink Peep. Chocolate just will not do. Not yellow or blue.

      Very quick story that will only make sense to those of you who celebrate Passover.  I went to my aunt and uncle's seder tonight.  My aunt's mother has Alzheimer's disease and is in an assisted living facility.  They apparently had a seder there earlier tonight, and hid the afikomen, but no one remembered where they hid it.  I know I shouldn't find that funny, but it is funny.  (For anyone wishing they knew what I was talking about: part of the Passover seder (seder = meal) involves hiding a piece of matzoh for people to find later (the piece of matzoh you hide = afikomen).)

      This recent bout of linking to other people's stuff is going to stop very soon, but before it does check out  urlLink Neo Tokyo Times , a new blog by a law-student-to-be that's pretty entertaining so far.  I've linked you directly to the post that mentions me, but if you scroll down a bit you'll get to a treatise on why John McCain should be Kerry's VP nominee.  There's something nicely self-deprecating about this blog.  Aw, I probably just like it because he said something nice about me.

       urlLink Scheherazade Fowler  posts in response to  urlLink Will Baude 's post about making the decision about where to go to law school.  For anyone making that decision, here's a few things I know now that I didn't know when I was choosing.  This may or may not be relevant to anyone, but it's the best I can do.  1. My law school experience has not been dependent on how many hours the library is open, how many books the library has, how nice the classrooms are, how pretty the buildings are, how many faculty members there are, what the faculty/student ratio is, how much they charge for photocopies, how edible the cafeteria food is, the high-school-style lockers in the basement tunnels, how many course offerings there are, how much reading I've had to do, what the office of career service provides, the outside lecturers who come to speak, my legal writing class, the computer facilities available, the size of the student body, the health plan, or, hard to believe, the weather.  2. My law school experience has been only marginally dependent on the quality of the dorms and other available housing, the neighborhood eating choices, or the size of my classes.  3. So what's left?  My law school experience has been mostly dependent on three factors:  A. Finding some number of faculty members who I think are brilliant, engaging, and motivating -- enough to keep me interested in classes, and to hold out the hope that there are more that I haven't yet found.  All you need is one, really.  One who makes you want to take all of his or her classes, and who gives you hope there's more.  The problem with this as a tool for decision-making is that I'm pretty sure there's at least one at every school.  But I've found it important.  B. The extracurricular opportunities.  Make sure there's stuff you're interested in being a part of.  Again, I'm pretty sure you can do this at every school.  But, again, I've found it important.  So make sure.  Without extracurriculars, life is boring.  C. Your fellow students.  Once again, I'm sure there are great people everywhere, and less-great people everywhere.  So, again, not sure if this helps anyone make a decision.  But it's been probably the most important factor contributing to my contentedness here.  I don't care if it rains every day.  Well, all else being equal....  But it's not worth making a decision over it.  This post offers nothing extraordinary, I know.  I'm trying to help.  But I think for the most part, you can probably make it worth your while anywhere you end up, or you can be miserable anywhere you go.  I don't know how you can tell beforehand, or if there's really a difference in how you'll feel at one place versus another.  Wow, that's unhelpful advice.  Sorry.

       urlLink Sua Sponte  has a post about law school rankings that links to a post by  urlLink Glorfindel , and  urlLink Waddling Thunder  and  urlLink Heidi  have related posts.  More than about the rankings, they're about how students at higher-ranked schools have more opportunities than students at lower-ranked schools, at least if you look beyond the top student or two at the lower-ranked places, and how sometimes having more opportunities isn't really that great because there are also more costs and more pressures to take certain jobs, and also how the rankings can distort stuff because what's really the difference between #15 and #18 yet sometimes people make decisions based on that, and how it's bad to go to law school not knowing what you want to do and get sucked into doing what everyone else is doing, but it's not that bad to go do what everyone else is doing if that's what you really want to do.  I'm making a mess of their posts, so go read them if any of this interests you.  I wouldn't be linking if I didn't think they were worth it.  For now, I'm just going to point you over there and leave it at that.  I started typing to see if anything useful came out as far as my own feelings and thoughts, but I'm not there yet.  It's a muddle of stuff like "we all have lots of choices and no choices, both at the same time," and "the risk/reward threshold falls at different places for different people," and "it would suck to spend three years in law school and not be able to get a job -- but I'm not sure it would suck more than spending three years not in law school and not being able to get a job, so I don't know what that means."  Many of my friends are not in law school.  Not many of them are thrilled with what they're doing, although lots of them are doing things that are reasonably interesting.  One of the things I like about law school is that it's not really stopping me from doing too many things, and at the end I get a degree, which will let me do all sorts of things I couldn't have done before, will make it easier to get to do some things I could have done before, and even if it turns out I end up doing something I didn't need the law degree to do, I can make the argument that it took the three years here to figure out that what I wanted to do was whatever that is, and so I needed this to find that -- and I can also make the argument that if I'm wrong, I've still got the degree.  Because my opportunity cost is unclear to me -- I don't know what it is exactly I'd be doing if I wasn't here, and certainly I have no idea how successful I'd be at it, and whether I really am losing three years that I'd have otherwise used much better if I wasn't here, and so I'm happy to keep myself in the dark about that, assume I'm losing very little (except for the cost, which is obviously really really non-negligible), and stay convinced that even if this doesn't end up being the only possible decision I might have made, it was at least a good and reasonable one.  I don't know how that relates to the U.S. News rankings at all.  And, yeah, I realize that for the second post in a row I've apologized for having nothing to say and then written a paragraph.  Whoops again.  What else can I do?    UPDATE:  urlLink See here .  A guy who's going to be a 1L at Harvard next year, and has a week-old weblog, comments.

       urlLink Heidi  has a thoughtful post about being unable to force yourself to work all the time and needing to just let things happen as they will, when you're ready to do them.  I think she articulates it all very nicely.  I'm tempted to add my own thoughts, since this is my weblog and everything, but I don't think I really have anything all that profound to add.  I think we all struggle with the balance between forcing ourselves to do stuff that isn't fun but we have to get it done versus trusting that we'll get it done without forcing ourselves.  And despite the track record -- I'm guessing most people in law school generally get stuff done that they need to get done, eventually, somehow -- it's still hard to trust that at some point before the paper's due, writing it will actually not feel like torture.  Okay, I guess I did add some thoughts of my own.  Whoops.  But not too many.

       Back in Boston   I made a "to-do list" while I was on the bus and discovered I have 64 things to do.  That's not an exaggeration.  I've accomplished one and a half of them so far.  One of the items on my list is to come up with some headlines/stories to contribute to the April Fools edition of the law school newspaper, which will be a week late because of Spring Break.  Feel free to e-mail any headline ideas, if you don't mind my stealing them and turning them into articles.  "Lawyer comes to campus, talks about law" is my first inspiration.

       No More Spring Break :-(     I was going to head back up to school tomorrow, but all reasonable-hour journeys of the $10 Chinatown bus are sold out.  So back I go this afternoon.  Tasks for the 4-hour bus ride:  1. Read copy of Entertainment Weekly I took from parents   2. Lament how few pages it is, and how much more time I have on bus 3. Figure out how bus makes a profit charging only $10 4. Reluctantly, open casebook and do my corporations reading 5. Try to ignore smell of Roy Rogers food residue that has built up in every crack and crevice of the bus, since it stops there in both directions 6. Make to-do list, realize how long it is, and ponder the feasibility of cloning myself 7. Watch ten minutes of Spider-Man on small TV screen, since it's apparently the only videocassette the Chinatown bus company owns 8. Look out window.  Oh, it's highway. 9. Regret not bringing anything to eat or drink. 10. Eavesdrop on phone conversation of girl across the aisle.  Make mental note to avoid getting too close to her, since she seems to have some sort of grotesque illness she's describing to her best friend.  Also, she (ohmygod!) has such a crush on the bus driver it's unbelievable.  Uh, yeah. 11. Revise to-do list. 12. Make cell phone call.  Realize people are listening.  Hang up. 13. Re-read Entertainment Weekly.  Return to step 2 and repeat.

      I saw "Jersey Girl" this afternoon in between a lovely lunch and a delightful dinner (don't you wish you were on Spring Break?).  It was as if Kevin Smith decided to make the most commercial movie he could possibly come up with.  It wasn't  bad , but it wasn't  good  either.  Some notes that don't give anything away:  1. What a waste of the marvelously talented George Carlin.  Why would they decide to cast George Carlin when any one of a thousand actors could have played his part?  His character spends much of the film communicating via facial expression, which isn't exactly taking advantage of Carlin's talents.  He spends most of the rest of his film interacting with his two buddies, both of whom look like they came from Central Casting under "older blue-collar working stiffs," and, for me, were the most unsatisfying characters in the film because they added nothing but made the whole film seem that much more paint-by-number.  2. The young actress who plays the daughter of Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck looks exactly like Jennifer Lopez... and nothing like Ben Affleck.  It was as if they held a casting call for seven-year-old girls who look just like Jennifer Lopez, but didn't bother to consider that a theoretical child may also look like its father too... so instead of really looking like their child, she looks like a disturbing Jennifer Lopez clone.  It's kind of eerie how similar they look, actually.  3. There is so much on-the-verge-of-crying going on in this movie, and so much obtrusive make-you-want-to-cry soundtrack going on that it even got me tearing up, and I wasn't sad.  I just couldn't help it -- the violins swell, Ben Affleck starts rubbing his eyes... but it felt so wrong....  4. Lots of movies have this baffling, baffling problem -- the entire climax hinges on a business meeting that's scheduled at the same time as a school play... and, apparently, in the world of very ordinary movies, business meetings cannot be rescheduled.  Ever.  I know I've seen this plot before.  Mrs. Doubtfire comes to mind, where at least they pretended the meeting was with someone busy... but still, it strains credibility to its utmost to imagine that normal business meetings are scheduled (a) without letting someone consult their calendar, and (b) on stone tablets that can never be edited.  Also, in this case, it wasn't even clear what the meeting was supposed to accomplish exactly.  This is a weak way out of actually writing a good script.  "Oh, we need a conflict.  How about a business meeting, because those can never be changed."  Lazy.  5. There's a scene in Central Park where the seven-year-old girl is walking on a ledge.  There's no railing.  I kept wishing she'd fall.  This is not a good sign for a movie.  6. The movie jumps seven years forward in time, and none of the characters (except the baby --> girl) age at all.  It's baffling that they couldn't throw some lines on Ben Affleck's face, or dye George Carlin's hair for the first part... or do something, anything to make these people look younger or older in seven years.  7. Liv Tyler, who I've never before noticed in any movie I've seen, I will likely never notice again.  I was struck by a complete absence of any interest I had in either her character or her acting.  She's reasonably attractive, but played a character I found very annoying, and, maybe this just means she's a great actress, but I got the impression it wasn't much of a stretch.  I know nothing about Liv Tyler though, so maybe she's an awesome person who just got stuck with this dud of a role in this very ordinary movie.

      I'm going to take advantage of all of this traffic  urlLink Brian Leiter  has been sending me over the last 24 hours or so, and write a song parody about one of his favorite topics, the U.S. News Law School Rankings.   "It's Still Number Twelve To Me"  (to the tune of Billy Joel's "It's Still Rock And Roll To Me")  What's the matter with the kids I'm taking Are the scores that they have too low? Should I try to hire one more teacher 'Cause we're moving up the ranks too slow? How to raise the judges' score they're assessing, Is hard because the judges aren't doing more than guessing, Everybody's talking 'bout the new Dean, honey But it's still number twelve to me.  What's the matter with the Bar/Bri sales rep Can't we get one who'll make them pay? I don't want the rate to fall any further 'Cause alumni call me up and say: "I saw the latest U.S. News says we're dropping, The check that I just sent you: payment I am stopping" New prof, new dorm, but Dean was caught with kiddie porn It's still number twelve to me  Oh, it doesn't matter what they say in the papers Cause it's only US News that they read If there's a new list in town People gather all around All the anxious feelings numbers can feed As if one school has to be in the lead...  How about we take a few less students? Our rates'll fall and ranking will rise How about we fudge the job percentage? How'll they know if our report's filled with lies? Why did number four become number seven? Do we have a hope of rising one to be eleven? New books, new course, cafeteria's serving horse But it's still number twelve to me.

       April Fools Jokes on Law School Websites   From  urlLink Yale.edu :   Yale Law School has ties to the city of New Haven, a small, lively urban center with several first-rate museums and the best pizza in America. From  urlLink Columbia.edu :   We believe that, if approached thoughtfully, your candidacy for admission to law school may itself become a valuable learning experience, and not merely a bureaucratic hurdle to overcome. From  urlLink NYU.edu :   The living expenses portion of the student budget at NYU School of Law reflects 9 months of living in New York City. From  urlLink UMich.edu :   And the vibrant university life enveloping the city of Ann Arbor is but a few paces away. From  urlLink Stanford.edu :   The Law School welcomes individuals with... learning disabilities. Yeah, that last one doesn't really work.  I'm not trying to make any actual statement here.  Stanford's website, though, is remarkably free of hyperbole and unsupported assertions that just sound silly on their face.  So I had to take what I could get.

      A good April Fools Day gag for a weblog would be to post a long and melodramatic account of why circumstances beyond his or her control have forced the blog to end, and perhaps go into gory detail about these circumstances, which would no doubt involve a distant cousin, a fire, an unfortunate slip-and-fall, a rusty nail, a case of mistaken identity, and some instant Quaker oatmeal, bringing readers to tears only to realize it's April 1st.  I don't feel like writing that post, so instead you'll have to survive on imagination alone.  Exam questions if exams were given on April Fools Day might be a fun post.  Kind of predictable though.  Long fact patterns, confusing ambiguities, how much could I really do with that?  Maybe a hoax about a news article.  Hard to do because of the linking, but maybe if I liberally "quote" from something, no one will bother to realize the  urlLink link  is a fake:   WASHINGTON, DC (AP) -- Yesterday, on the steps of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice William Rehnquist got down on one knee and proposed to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.  Despite each of them already being married, and despite that due to Rehnquist's advanced age, once he got down on one knee he needed medical assistance to get back up, the wedding is expected to occur next Thursday in the Rose Garden.  Because they are both Justices, they can override the usual laws about bigamy, as well as the usual blood test requirements, since taking any blood from either of them  would cause the stock market to collapse for no apparent reason other than to finish this sentence.  Justice Antonin Scalia remarked, "I am so happy for Sandy and Bill.  May they make many children together, despite their advanced age."  Clarence Thomas will reportedly supply cans of soda for the guests; Orrin Hatch will provide the musical entertainment; Strom Thurmond will regretfully be unable to attend due to his recent death. See, that wouldn't be very believable.  Perhaps if I wrote about something obscure enough, no one would doubt it.  Like this fake-linked  urlLink article :   NEW YORK (Reuters) -- Yesterday, the New York state legislature passed a law banning beavers from urinating within 40 feet of a lamppost or within 30 feet of another beaver, except on Wednesdays, when antelopes aren't allowed to cough... But I don't even know what I was trying to do there.  Let me sleep on it, and see if I get any better April Fools ideas in the morning.  Hope everyone's pranks are successful and none of my readers end up in jail.  WAIT!  I've got it!  The perfect concept, that I won't be able to execute to its fullest potential!   Top Ten Pranks To Pull In Class On April Fools Day   1. Write mean things about your classmates on the chalkboard before class, but before they show up... ERASE THEM! 2. Leave to go to the bathroom... BUT GO CHECK YOUR E-MAIL INSTEAD! 3. Raise your hand, and then when the professor calls on you... PRETEND YOU WERE JUST SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD! 4. Instead of sitting in your assigned seat... MOVE ONE SEAT TO THE LEFT! 5. Spend the whole class looking like you're typing your notes... BUT NEVER TURN THE COMPUTER ON! 6. Bring the right casebook... TO THE WRONG CLASS! 7. Don't do the reading... UNLESS YOU'RE ON PANEL! 8. Replace the professor's white chalk with a piece of... COLORED CHALK! 9. Show up to class... THREE AND A HALF MINUTES LATE! 10. Go up to the professor after class... AND ASK HIM A STUPID QUESTION YOU SHOULD ALREADY KNOW THE ANSWER TO!

      When I went to see "Super Size Me" today -- see two posts below -- the movie was preceded by a whole bunch of previews.  I like previews.  But previews at theaters that show "independent movies" like this one bring that enjoyment to a whole new level.  Among the movies previewed: "The Story of the Weeping Camel."  Is that not the perfect independent film title?  Could anyone, just from the title, imagine that this movie *wouldn't* be an independent film?  Is there any chance the voiceover could ever say, "Mission Impossible's Tom Cruise... Pretty Woman's Julia Roberts... in a film directed by Steven Spielberg.  The Story of the Weeping Camel."  Not a chance.  Another movie previewed was called "The Door in the Floor," which looked for a fleeting moment like a Dr. Seuss (Theodore Geisel) biopic, but it appears not to be.  And one of the other movies playing in the theater was called "My Mother Likes Women," which, I'm guessing, is not a big-budget action thriller.  Moviefone had an amusing ad making fun of casting independent films.  It got me thinking: we have big movies, and then we have independent film.  But imagine if these independent filmmakers, instead of making movies, they made ads.  I repeated this idea to myself three times (and to the person next to me once) so I would remember it, and turn it into something.  So here goes.  Commercials, as created by independent filmmakers:  #1. NIKE SNEAKERS A boy sits in a crowded hut sewing two leather panels together.  He speaks a foreign tongue.  The subtitle reads: "My innocence is lost as I sew these two leather panels together."  A donkey walks into the frame.  "Hello, donkey.  Can I ride you to salvation?"  A woman in the background wails softly over the strains of sitar music.  An elderly woman enters the frame.  The boy shrieks.  Subtitle: "Grandma, you're alive!"  Pan to grandma's feet.  She is wearing sneakers.  The logo appears.  Nike.  Superimposed text: "Nike.  For all the times in your life."  #2. HAMBURGER HELPER Jerky camerawork on a gritty Hoboken, New Jersey street.  The door to a small bodega swings open, and we enter.  A young woman is pushing pins into a rag doll and chanting.  A precocious child falls from the sky and onto a pile of dirty magazines.  His mother yanks him up by the arm.  "Vladimir," she scolds.  "No!"  We hear thunder in the distance.  A horse rides up.  A police officer disembarks and enters the store.  "I'm leaving my wife," he announces.  "She's left me for another woman, played by Hope Davis or perhaps Laura Linney."  The precocious child hands the police officer a box.  Pan to the box.  It is Hamburger Helper.  "Makes a great meal," he whispers.  A knife hits the boy in the chest and he dies.  #3. MILLER LITE BEER A goat lies mangled in a ditch.  We hear the soft sounds of a classical guitar.  From offscreen: "Henry, don't do this to me."  "But I have to Susan, it's the only road to justice."  We pan to see it's a small TV, in a dark motel room, where Skeet Ulrich is pasting together a ransom note.  "I have your daughter," it reads, "and I've mangled your goat."  Holly Hunter enters from the motel room bathroom, cutting herself with a razor.  "I've lost the will to live, Mr. O'Malley."  She impales herself on a butter knife.  Cut back to the highway ditch.  Philip Seymour Hoffman pulls up in a pickup truck, removes the cap from a Miller Lite, and takes a sip.  The goat stirs, and rises from the ditch.  Close-up on the beer.

      I saw the documentary film "Super Size Me" this afternoon, about a guy who ate McDonalds food three meals a day for 30 days, and -- surprise -- he gained 25 pounds and contracted a whole bunch of health problems, like liver badness and high cholesterol.  The film was undeniably entertaining, and looked a lot like Michael Moore's work, in that it was a mixture of bits -- man-on-the-street interviews, sideline investigations into school lunches, and more -- with some cartoony stuff and all sort of put together like it's trying to be entertaining and fast-paced, which is all good, I guess.  It's worth seeing, although you probably won't learn a ton.  But it's entertaining.  What I found especially interesting was his sideline into school lunches and how they're all pretty bad, and come from boxes, and have no redeeming qualities at all.  And the school lunch provider the film mentioned, Sodexho, is the company that does the Harvard Law School cafeteria, which is kind of neat.  I have nothing especially profound to say.  I give the movie a 7.5 out of 10, if I suddenly became the kind of person who ranked movies on a scale of 1-10.  One of the people I saw the movie with made the observation afterwards that everyone was taking the escalator instead of the stairs, which was kind of funny.

      A couple of days ago, a friend mentioned that she'd read "The Da Vinci Code."  Along with what seems like everyone else who reads.  So I asked eher what the big deal is, and why it's getting so much media attention.  She said something like (I'm sure I'm getting the details wrong, but I'm not that familiar with that testament, so I don't know the baseline I'm coming from) it was because it posits that Jesus was married to Mary and so Mary wasn't really a virgin, and Jesus wasn't really the son of God.  I'm sure I've screwed that up in some major way, but just pretend I know what I'm talking about.  Anyway, it gets me thinking that if all you need for a best-selling book is to totally turn a religion on its head, I can totally do that.  Hence: my book proposal for the fictionalized new interpretation of the oldest testament we've got -- "The Goldberg Code"  1. There's actually seven Gods: a God of the earth, a God of the sea, a God of the animals, a God of the vegetables, a God of bagels with lox, a God of mercy, and a God of reality television.  2. "Kosher" actually doesn't refer to stuff you should and shouldn't eat, but instead refers to pets you should and shouldn't have.  Meaning all you need to do is avoid domesticating pigs and lobsters in your house, and you can actually eat them all you want.  But you can't feed your cats any milk, because that would be a violation of the whole milk-meat thing.  And you can't put yogurt on your dog.  Not that you do that normally.  But you can't.  Because God says.  3. The Jewish New Year can never fall on a Thursday.  Sorry.  Just the way it is.  4. Jackie Mason is a prophet, and the three wise men are Jerry Seinfeld, Woody Allen, and Don Rickles.  Is Don Rickles even Jewish?  I have no idea.  That's probably a stage name, but I don't know if it's Don Goldricklesberg, or it's something completely different.  5. Shawn Green, Gabe Kapler, and the many, many other Jewish baseball players actually aren't Jewish at all.  It's all a communist plot.  6. No, I have no idea if this is even *supposed* to be funny, or what exactly I'm doing with this post here, except apologizing for yesterday's posts that were completely lacking any humor by at least trying today, even if I'm failing horribly.

      Someone e-mailed me a few weeks back and guessed my  urlLink Myers-Briggs personality type  (find out yours by clicking the link).  I'd taken a Myers-Briggs test before -- at my software company job, actually.  They brought in a consultant to go through some workplace analysis.  A few weeks later they did a layoff.  I didn't make the connection that perhaps the personality test results were used to see who to keep, but when I mentioned it to someone else, they thought that was obvious.  I really have no idea.  But anyway, I'm pretty consistently on these tests an INFJ.  The closest call on the four is the Introverted/Extroverted scale -- I'm relatively uncomfortable in large crowd / loud bar / mobbed cocktail party type things, but I do crave being around people and don't have a ton of tolerance for amusing myself for long periods of time without outside contact.  I just prefer more low-key stuff to loud crowded stuff, and don't like being the center of attention, but do like being with other people.  So I'm somewhere in the middle of the Introverted/Extroverted scale.  But reasonably strong on the other three elements.  I share this (1) just to share, and out of curiosity if anyone who's reading wants to share, and (2) because I wanted to mention the introvert/extrovert stuff to lead up to a brief and anticlimactic anecdote.  So I'm relatively shy, especially in new situations, so at these law firm lunches, I'm usually not very interesting, because I'm meeting these associates for the first time and if we don't hit on something I have something to say about, I don't know that I'm really able to get myself into a real compelling conversational mode.  It's hard.  But sometimes I find myself forcing words out -- knowing I need to say something, and so I say something.  But sometimes, in trying to say something in response to whatever, I don't think about what exactly I'm saying.  And it's not a terrible thing, because I have nothing bad to say.  Usually when I go wrong it's that I'm trying to be marginally amusing, and I'm just failing miserably.  Or I say something off the cuff that then gets taken slightly more seriously than I meant it.  Like at lunch on Friday, with some associates, in response to something, I mentioned that I didn't think bar review courses sounded all that necessary, since all it is is a video of some guy talking, and why not just buy the books and study from them.  And that didn't get a good reaction, and I just felt silly for saying it.  Or mentioning I haven't taken Evidence, and aren't signed up for next year, and then discovering most people think Evidence is pretty important and I should take it.  I have nothing against Evidence, I just would rather take other stuff.  And when I said it, I just said it to say something, and not to make some big point about not thinking I need to learn evidence if I have to deal with evidence.  This is all very inconsequential.  But I gotta write something, right?

      Some days the world seems filled with opportunities.  But some days you just can't get yourself doing much of anything.  I don't mean can't-get-out-of-bed-sounds-like-you-need-to-see-a-head-doctor can't do much of anything, but just an eat breakfast, surf the Internet and set my fantasy team lineups, shower, send some e-mail, go out to lunch, go to the supermarket, fiddle around with a DVD, write the first verse of a song I'll probably never finish, fold some laundry, watch a few innings of the Mets game, read a half a magazine, make a list of what I'm doing this week, make some plans for tomorrow, fiddle around with an uninspired weblog post, and, oops, it's nighttime kind of day.  A where-did-the-day-go kind of day.  A boy-I-didn't-get-anything-useful-done kind of day.  And maybe doing nothing is useful.  But I somehow feel like this world filled with opportunities only gets scarier if I go to sleep no closer to any of those opportunities than I was when I woke up.  And I don't even know what I really mean by opportunities.  Like I said, some days the world seems filled with opportunities.  Of all sorts.  But then sometimes I'm just, I don't know, uninspired to go find them.  Just for a day.  I guess we all have these days.  I don't even know what I'm talking about at this point.  I just felt like I ought to write something and post it.  And now, even though I have an idea for a post that I'm going to write, I hate deleting stuff, so here you go.  Rambling without nouns.  Oh boy.

      I wanted to just quickly catch up on stuff from the past few days I haven't had a chance to write about.  On Thursday, we had our first summer associate event at the law firm -- I think this is the same at most of these places, but basically over the course of the summer there's a bunch of summer associate events -- a Broadway show, baseball game, scavenger hunt, Central Park Zoo, etc etc -- from talking to friends at other firms, there's a lot of overlap in the lists between firms.  Maybe they farm it out to some law firm summer associate activity planning agency, I dunno.  Probably not.  But who knows.  Anyway, our event on Thursday was an art tour in Soho (which, for anyone unfamiliar, is an area of Manhattan with lots of art galleries, many just these independent artists showcasing their art, not like museum stuff, but interesting stuff).  People who've been reading for a while may recall that I'm not a huge art museum fan... but this wasn't for the art, it was because it was an activity and it's cool to get to know the other summer associates, and it's something cool to do.  So we got split up into a bunch of smaller groups and went to look at a bunch of galleries, guided by a tour guide.  I'd never before heard the term "installation art," which apparently means you get an offer to present your art in a specific space, and you tailor the art thing to that particular space and build it there.  2 of the 4 places we saw were "installation art" -- one was a piece of art composed of a bumpy floor made out of wood, and the peaks and valleys and contours apparently represented stuff.  I'm not very good at reviewing art, sorry.  The second was a room that was created by 4 young artists as a representation of a dreamscape bedroom, with wax keys hanging from the ceiling and 12 mattresses piled high and cut in half.  Lovely.  Then we saw some Olmec masks made by an artist who had a thing for male and female genitalia.  And our first one was a guy who takes lots of photographs and pieces them together to make big photographic creations, that were actually pretty cool.  That one was my favorite.  His web site is  urlLink here  if you're curious.  His stuff was actually quite impressive.  Then we had a 3-hour meal in a nice restaurant.  So much food, the lunches, this dinner, just too much food.  And good food all starts to taste the same after a while.  At least to me.  And I like food.  But I'm not a big guy.  My appetite can't handle it.  I'm still full the next day.  It's frustrating.  Too much food.  Anyway, then yesterday at work I did some work.  If it was really interesting, I probably wouldn't feel comfortable saying what it was; if it wasn't interesting, it wouldn't make for a very good post.  So I won't tell you whether it was interesting or not, and you can just use your imagination to go in whatever direction you like... :)   Also, yesterday on the way to work I read Fox News's Greta Van Susteren's book "My Turn at the Bully Pulpit" (my title may be off -- I left it at work and don't have it in front of me).  It was very mediocre.  There is simply no reason to read it.  I mean, it's not a bad book, but it's just useless, it's throwaway, it offers nothing of any value unless you are a huge Greta Van Susteren fan and want to know more about her.  I like books that make me feel like I'm seeing some world I don't usually see.  This didn't do that.  Nothing against Greta Van Susteren.  She seems reasonably bright, and well-intentioned.  I just didn't get anything out of her book.  Like when I listened to Diana DeGarmo on American Idol.  She can sing, but, eh, just doesn't do anything for me.  Just watched the American Idol finale (taped it on Wednesday).  Long.  Glad for fast forward.  Glad Fantasia won. I guess.  Whatever.

      I just got home from a long day.  Left work at about 4:15 to head down to Princeton and see the Triangle Club (the theater group I was part of) show.  They do their big show in the fall but then re-stage it for Reunions weekend, which is today through Sunday.  It's my 4th reunion, so not a major one, and not enough people to make it worth a weekend, but I hadn't seen the Triangle show yet, and I've seen every one since I left -- and they do a Triangle Reunion in the theater lobby after the show, and so I definitely wanted to go.  Got down there, had dinner with some friends, and then saw the show, and hung out for a while talking to people.  I have something to say about the feelings that emerge going back and telling people what I'm up to, and hearing what they're up to... but I don't have it to say at 2:30 in the morning.  Tomorrow, I hope.  I feel like some sort of young-adulthood expectations-vs-reality piece is brewing in my head, spurred in part by some stuff a friend and I were talking about on the train ride back, in a good long conversation.  I'm tired.  And rightfully so.  More in the morning.

      I'm a few weeks late with this, but former New York Times executive editor Howell Raines has a  urlLink lengthy discussion  of his tenure at the newspaper, and his visions on the future.  I'm only about 40% through it, and it's a fascinating read so far.  Maybe because I just read Ken Auletta's excellent book "Backstory" (see my thoughts on that a few days below), which has a lot of related New York Times discussion, but really, if you read the Times, this is a piece worth reading.

       Questions and Answers about Legal Research   Q: So I have this retarded research assignment --  A: Don't say retarded.  It's not polite.  The phrase is "mentally handicapped."  Q: Okay, so I have this mentally handicapped research assignment to go find all of the cases in the 3rd circuit that have to deal with circus clowns and write up a summary of the current law.  And I have no idea where to begin.  A: Neither do I, dude.  You're screwed.  Q: But you're supposed to be this super research dude.  That's why I'm coming to you for help.  Dude!  A: Okay, dude, calm down.  Let's start with the basics.  There's three options when it comes to your legal research.  There's Lexis, there's Westlaw, and there's books.  Q: Books, that's funny.  Books.  Ha!  I'm on the floor, rolling around in my own vomit.  That's hilarious.  Books!  A: Your own vomit?  Q: Yeah, stomach flu.  Besides, it's better than rolling around in someone else's vomit.  A: I suppose...  Q: At least your own vomit, you know what's in there.  Like I know I had corn, and here it is, in between my toes.  But someone else's vomit, who knows if those are nuts, beans, or pumpkin seeds?  A: Pumpkin seeds?  Who eats pumpkin seeds?  Q: Dude, lots of people eat pumpkin seeds.  I ate them all the time as a kid when I was in Little League.  The smart kid's chewing tobacco, we all used to call it.  Okay, we never used to call it that, but we should have.  I love pumpkin seeds.  My mom used to buy a pumpkin each year and scoop out the seeds and roast them.  It was awesome.  Dude!  A: Did you drag me out of the bathroom to talk about pumpkin seeds?  Q: No, I dragged you out of the bathroom to talk about legal research.  What do I do?  A: Call the Westlaw helpline.  They'll help you for free.  It's 1-800-73-FATTY.  Q: 1-800-73-FATTY?  Why would that be their phone number?  That sounds like the Weight Watchers phone number.  What the heck does the "Fatty" mean with regards to legal research?  A: It's actually 1-800-REF-ATTY -- like "reference attorney" for short -- but it's more fun to say it the other way.  And it helps you remember.  Or at least it helps me.  And they'll totally answer all of your questions and help you set up your search.  Q: On a date?  A: Huh?  Q: You said "set up my search."  Set it up on a date?  Is my search going to get more action than I get?  A: Could it possibly get any less?  After all, it's almost midnight and you're rolling around in your own vomit asking me about legal research.  Is this really a compelling picture you're painting of yourself that's going to have people falling over themselves to go out with you?  Q: It will after I drug them.  A: That's illegal.  Q: What?  A: Haven't you been paying attention in law school?  Q: No.  Duh.  That's why I need your help.  I don't even know the difference between a circuit court and a district court.  A: That's easy.  A-minus average for circuit court; B-plus for district.  Q: Oh, for clerkships?  A: Yeah, for clerkships.  Duh.  You applying for one?  Q: Me, no.  I don't want to have to move to Idaho.  A: But clerkships are awesome.  You get to make up law.  Q: Really?  A: How the heck should I know?  I don't have a clue what clerks do.  I don't have a clue what lawyers do either.  Q: Aren't you working at a firm this summer?  A: Yeah...  Q: So...  A: I've been there eight days, what do you want?  You expect after eight days I know all there is to know about this stuff?  Q: Well, no, but...  A: But what, dude?  Q: But at least you should have picked up something...  A: I think I picked up a fungal infection from my office mate, actually.  Q: That sucks.  A: No kidding.  Q: So I should just call that fatty number and they'll help me out?  A: I think so.  That's what they keep saying.  Q: But you've never called?  A: No, dude, that stuff's for losers.  Q: Awesome.  Well, thanks for the tip.  A: No problem.  See you tomorrow.  Q: Yeah, see you later dude.

       urlLink Mitch  has some in-the-trenches reports as he spends his week doing the Harvard Law Review writing competition.   urlLink Slate  has an ongoing diary this week written by a writer at Late Night With Conan O'Brien.  It's really quite funny.  Surprised me.  That's the two things I've read today that I've liked.  Oh, and here's a  urlLink crappy article in the New York Times  that makes people with weblogs sound like morons.  Why is writing this stuff worse than playing spider solitaire or whatever crap people do to fill up their time?  At least doing this makes me think, makes me write, gives me a bit of an audience, and provides an outlet for stuff.  Stupid article.  Or maybe I'm just stupid for thinking this isn't a waste of energy.  But I like having the audience.  And I've made some friends doing this.  And it doesn't keep me from doing anything I'd be doing anyway.  And it gives me motivation and a reason to write.  And who knows who's reading.  It gets my words out there.  Is this a bad thing?  Why do I care what this article says?    Anyway....  Tonight I went to see some stand-up comedy, for no particular reason.  Well, sort of.  There's this comedian who I saw on Comedy Central doing something a few months ago,  urlLink Mike Birbiglia  (the link is to his web site), and he just came off as extraordinarily likable.  His material was funny, nothing amazing but solid funny stuff -- but just as a human being, he seemed like a really nice person.  Most stand-up comics don't.  The bad ones come off like bad stand-up comics, and just do bits and you don't get a sense of their personalities other than they're not very good stand-up comics but probably don't realize it.  Or some have great material, like George Carlin, and come off as smart, gifted, talented, funny, all good stuff.  But I don't know that George Carlin comes off as a particularly lovely human being.  I think he'd be thrillingly interesting to talk to -- but I have no idea whether he helps old ladies cross the street.  But, anyway, Mike Birbiglia came off as this earnest, decent, pleasant human being, self-deprecating, not taking himself too seriously, just a really genuine nice person.  And maybe it's all an act.  But I checked out his web site, listened to the clips... all solid... and then was reading New York magazine this morning (which I've been reading since Adam Moss, former editor of the New York Times magazine, moved over to New York -- and it's turned into what the New York Times magazine was, in a lot of ways -- something that's pretty much guaranteed each week to have some stuff I'm really interested in reading.  Which the New York Times magazine doesn't since Adam Moss left, so I have no choice but to believe that Adam Moss, whoever he is, is the reason, and he and I like similar kinds of subjects.  Which is cool, I guess.  He has a fan.  I mean, I subscribed to New York entirely because he became the editor.  He should read my weblog.  Anyway.  New York has comedian listings, and I saw that Mike Birbiglia was at a comedy club in NY tonight, and so I convinced a friend to go check it out with me (actually didn't take much convincing, which was good, because I'm not very good at convincing people to do stuff they don't want to do -- I cave in too easily).  And, again, he came off as a really nice person.  And he was funny, not like rolling on the floor hysterical, but funny, consistently.  It was a small audience and a pretty bad audience, since it was relatively early in the evening, and the other comics who preceded him were pretty dreadful, especially the MC, but they're always dreadful.  Birbiglia has this innocence about him, that you want to root for him.  It's weird.  I can totally see a sitcom being built around him.  He'd either be a junior high school teacher or a young marketing executive.  Single but dating.  Always bad dates.  Which make good "B" stories in the episodes.  Jason Bateman could do guest spots as his older brother.  He lives in the basement of his parents' house, with his parents played by Edie McClurg and John O'Hurley, who own a travel agency.  But he wants to get a place with his best friend from college, who he's always hanging out with, played by Rider Strong, and the girl he has a crush on but who's always dating the wrong guys, played by Kirsten Dunst.  See, I've got the pilot already written in my head.  Mike Birbiglia: I want to help write your sitcom.  This is my plea for the fates of the world to intervene.  Please.  Intervene.  Anyway, check out his website, check out his shows tomorrow night and Sunday.  I don't why I'm pimping him on here -- I don't know him, I've never met him, and maybe he's not actually a nice person but it's all an act.  But he seems really nice.  And he does jokes about panda bears.  And what's not to love about panda bears?

      From an ad on the subway this morning for a law firm I made fun of about a year ago for having ads with a fighting leprechaun on them:  "We fight for kids' with brain damage."  Well, "I make fun of lawyers' who don't know how to use proper punctuation!?;*#,.?"

      I had an hour of Lexis training today.  I was tempted to sign into Westlaw on the Lexis training computer, just to see what would happen.  The trainer kept saying stuff like "there was big demand for that feature, Westlaw doesn't have it, only Lexis does."  Yeah, it's like drop-down menus, or automatic pdf conversion, or something so marginal.  Don't get me wrong -- I actually prefer Lexis to Westlaw (Note to any Lexis reps reading: Can I get points for publishing that?  Note to any Westlaw reps reading: I'm just kidding).  I like Lexis better because it has more magazines, and reading Variety and the New York Times archives, and Newsweek, and Entertainment Weekly, and Sports Illustrated for free -- well, knowing I can, not that I actually do -- is pretty cool.

      This is an underdeveloped idea at this point, but just to write it down so I don't forget it.  Princeton has a bunch of alumni e-mail lists, about all sorts of things -- princeton-writing, princeton-career-networking, princeton-new-york, princeton-lawyers, etc.  But I think they should get even more broad.  princeton-bored, princeton-tired, princeton-angry... or even more specific -- princeton-addicted-to-painkillers, princeton-root-canal, princeton-likes-fish-better-than-chicken, princeton-contemplating-buying-new-socks.  There's a kernel of funny in this idea I'm doing a bad job of eliciting this morning.  Maybe this is a song parody waiting to happen; maybe it's a sketch; maybe it's just this, and it's just not that funny; maybe I use too many semicolons when I write.  Time to get ready for work.  Five days a week of going to work is a lot.

      There's that moment of panic when you realize you've messed something up, and it's totally your fault, and there's nothing you can do about it.  In a way that's a cool feeling -- in the same way that sometimes any feeling is a cool feeling, better than no feeling at all, and just gets the adrenaline pumping in a way that feels kind of invigorating every so often.  And I guess I'm talking needless panicking -- because panicking about real, actual, serious mistakes (oops, the scalpel shouldn't have gone that deep!) is not cool on any level, and even mistakes that aren't life or death, but fire-able offense kind of mistakes -- I don't know what that is at a law firm... falsifying information?  I don't know enough to name a laundry list of these things.  All this is to lead up to a silly little anecdote about a stupid mistake I made this afternoon that at the moment I realized it felt pretty disastrous, but that was just the adrenaline response, and then I realized it was just a stupid little mistake, and I'll probably survive.  Basically, I was working on the fourth draft of something, and accidentally e-mailed the initial rough draft out as the "latest version" reflecting all corrections -- I'd saved it in a different file and clicked on the wrong one to attach -- and then got back a whole set of comments that were in large part repeats of comments I'd already seen -- because the old draft didn't have them corrected like the new draft did.  So when I got it back, I panicked.  "So now the partner must think I'm too stupid to make the changes he wrote on the last version, and must be wondering why I would ignore his comments like that, and be pissed off that I was forcing him to write the same comments all over again, wasting his time, and just being stupid."  That was the basic gist of the story I started to tell myself.  And maybe that's completely the case.  But probably my explanation that I attached the wrong file will make sense, and instead he can just think I'm too stupid to attach the right file.  Which is less damning than being too stupid to make the changes I've been asked to make.  So I'll take that.    I'll find out in the morning whether this is a fire-able offense.  I'm guessing not.  But, hey, you never know.  Stay tuned... :)

      "Movants" comes up in spell check as "mutants."  That's funny.  I almost clicked "change" just for fun.  "The mutants requested an extension...."  Ha.  [This isn't actually funny, is it?  I'm just grasping for anything, aren't I?  This isn't a good sign.]  In a building I can see from my window, there's what I thought was a putting green on the rooftop ledge.  But in fact, the building is farther away than it looked, and so today, when I saw people there, and saw how small they were, I realized this was closer to a small soccer field than a putting green.  Although they probably don't play soccer there because if they did and the ball went over the wall, it would probably kill the people 30 stories below on the sidewalk.  It may be some sort of outdoor exercise facility.  I'm not completely certain.  There are orange cones though.  So maybe football.  But same problem as soccer with the ball.  Maybe nerf football.

      Check out "Blogger Survivor" at  urlLink De Novo .  I have no idea if this idea will have legs or not, but we're trying.  It could be pretty cool.  I think.

      Fancy-restaurant-lunch today included a dessert that was known on the menu as "Exotic Asian Fruit Tower."  Any guesses as to these exotic Asian fruits?  Guess.  I'll wait.  Okay, those were some good guesses.  All of them.  Even yours.  But the dessert?  Apple pie standing up inside a crispy pancake.  Really.  Or if it wasn't, it was doing an awesome job pretending.  I mean, it was good apple pie.  Really was.  But I didn't taste no exotic Asian fruits.    Oh well.  It was still worth the $9.50 I didn't have to pay for it.  And if the desserts cost $9.50... well, you can only imagine what the main dishes cost.  I'm currently reading "Backstory" by Ken Auletta, which is a collection of the author's long-form pieces mostly from the New Yorker about the business of journalism, behind-the-scenes at the New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, the New York Post / Daily News wars.  It's quite, quite excellent.  I wish the postscripts on each piece were longer and didn't try so hard to connect one piece to the next in what ends up feeling like a very forced fashion, but aside from those minor quibbles, it's at times a can't-put-it-down kind of book, and even when it's not, it's a worth-knowing-and-feel-like-I'm-learning-something kind of book.  So it's good.  Of course, I might just be more interested than most in this stuff, as evidenced by  urlLink this site  being one of my few must-read sites at least a couple of times a week.

      I have a side project I'm exploring -- am just beginning to explore -- but if anyone who reads this happens to (a) be thinking about filing for bankruptcy, (b) have filed for bankruptcy or had parents who filed for bankruptcy when you were a kid, or (c) have some expertise in this stuff, and might be willing to helping me out with something (an e-mail for more details invokes no commitment at all on your part for anything whatsoever), shoot me an e-mail.  Thanks.  ("Side project" is not a code word for "I am thinking about filing for bankruptcy," although it would be a pretty interesting experiment to put up a donation box and see if implying I'm bankrupt got me any contributions -- but, no, this isn't what this is about -- it's related to the third-year-paper requirement we have at school, and I'm trying to get my wheels spinning on an idea I've got.)

      I watched the Mets game on TV today, and saw Tom Glavine almost pitch the first no-hitter in Mets history, only to have Kit Pellow hit a double off the wall with 2 outs in the 8th.  So close.  But a one-hitter ain't too bad.  Clearly it was a productive day.  But it's hard to get motivated after a week of work.  I'll adjust.  Next weekend I'll cure the common cold or something like that.  I feel like doing another "all-request day" for the next 24 hours or so.  E-mail me a question, comment, concern, song parody prompt, whatever, and I'll see what I can come up with.

      Earlier in the week I mentioned the elevator entertainment -- the video screen with scrolling news, sports, weather, and more for people with attention deficit disorder who can't go unstimulated for 45 seconds.  What I didn't mention yet is that each day there's a "word of the day" on the screen.  On Thursday, the word was "defenestrate" -- to throw someone out of a window.  I think someone at the elevator-screen company has a sense of humor.  Here we are, in an elevator heading up a 50-story building -- and you've got to assume a building's gotta be pretty tall for them to bother paying for this system -- and the "word of the day" means throwing someone out a window?  I'm just about on the fortieth floor!  This is not what I want to be thinking about on my elevator ride!  I'm waiting for next week's words -- blackout, terrorism, nerve gas, anthrax, and random shooting.  These are not things I want to think about while I'm trapped inside a tall building.  Sorry.  And with that...  "Thirty-Third Floor, Please"  [Two older women get on an elevator.  There's a video screen in the elevator.  RUTH stands near the buttons.  SARA stands on the other side.]  SARA Can you press 33 for me?  RUTH Sure.  I'm on 31.  You work for the law firm?  SARA Yeah.  You work for the consulting firm?  RUTH Yeah.  I'm Ruth.  SARA What?  Sorry, I was distracted by the screen.  13 children dead in a licorice accident.  It's quite a tragedy.  RUTH Oh, the screen.  Yes, it's quite something.  SARA Isn't technology amazing.  They've even got the weather.  Apparently it's 62 on the ground, but 59 up where we are.  Well, 59 on 33.  Maybe it's 60 on 31.  I don't know.  RUTH I hate the screen.  SARA What?  Sorry.  The Dow is up 14 and a half.  It was only up 14 and a quarter when we got on.  Banner day on Wall Street.  RUTH I had all my money in tech stocks.  Lost a bundle.  Good thing my husband left me a nice chunk of change after the sponge cake accident.  SARA What?  Sorry.  The word of the day is chlamydia.  That's interesting.  RUTH My daughter has that.  SARA Your daughter?  What floor does she work on?  RUTH She doesn't work here.  She lives in Idaho.  She's a seamstress.  SARA What?  Sorry.  Betty White turns 79 today.  I loved her in that chicken commercial.  RUTH This isn't much of a conversation.  You keep distracted by the screen.  SARA Sorry.  What?  I'm distracted by the screen.  RUTH Yes, that's what I said.  SARA The dollar's down against the Yen.  Shocking news from the world markets.  RUTH The elevator's slow today.  SARA Time flies when you read the screen.  And look -- the animal of the day is the salamander.  I love salamanders.  They're so cute.  RUTH Is everyone on 33 as friendly as you?  SARA What?  Sorry.  The latest poll shows kidney beans are twice as popular as chick peas.  I never would have guessed.  [The elevator rings.  RUTH gets out.]  RUTH Have a good day.  SARA What?  Sorry.  Milk can feel pain.  Fascinating.  {Blackout.}

      On Friday I repeated socks.  Really.  It's not my fault.  I just didn't have enough pairs of dress socks to get me through the week.  I had two.  I borrowed two.  And then on Friday... well... it was Monday all over again.  I'm sorry.  It won't happen again.  I just bought more dress socks.  And a gray pair of pants, since I was alternating navy and tan (not the same pairs -- I have a bunch of each) and needed some variety.  And a cool-looking wrinkle-free blue shirt on sale that I liked, so I couldn't resist.  It was really cheap.  I didn't need to resist.  I got a paycheck yesterday for the first week of work.  My shirt cost about 1.5% of my weekly take-home pay.  That's about 45 minutes of work I guess.  Actually, that makes it sound like lot.  I'd rather go home 45 minutes early one day than have the shirt.  Uh oh.  Did I mess up?  Whatever.  I can afford the shirt.  Barely.  But I can.  I also bought a new toothbrush, since I was almost due for one, a magazine, and a smoothie.  My shopping spree.  Extraordinary, really.  And then I went to the public library for some books for the daily subway commute, since I'd finished what I had lying around.  Early in the week I read "Live From New York," the 600-page history of Saturday Night Live that came out about 18 months ago.  Solid.  Enjoyable.  A bit too long.  But good reading.  And then I read "Count Down," which is like the movie "Spellbound" but about the International Math Olympiad and the 6 kids on the U.S. team.  It was a little too quick, actually -- I could have enjoyed another 100 pages or so, and some more depth.  Too lightweight.  I recommend, but only if you think it sounds like something you'd like even if I didn't recommend.  It's not a must-read.  Then on Friday I took with me a book of essays about Paris by 1920s journalist Joseph Roth that a relative recommended.  It was a little too literary for me.  Didn't grab me, at least not on the subway.  Just didn't do it.  So, I got 6 books from the library.  Nothing I'm really, truly excited about reading, but all things I think will be decent enough for the commute.  I need to find a better library.  I will report as I complete.  Probably up first on Monday will be Ken Auletta's "Backstory" about the business of journalism.  We'll see.

Fast two-click printing   And 39 other marginally useful featurettes mixed with vague, unsupported claims.  This is just screaming for a parody.  Loudly.  Look for it this weekend.

      Billing time has been interesting so far.  We bill in 6-minute increments (tenths of an hour) here.  Not my time log, but we all can dream, can't we?  0.1 -- Adjusted my eyes to the light in the office (Nonbillable) 0.2 -- Read headlines on CNN.com (Nonbillable) 0.1 -- Daydreamed about stuff (Nonbillable) 0.1 -- Called partner who gave me assignment (Sort of billable?) 0.1 -- He didn't pick up his phone (Nonbillable) 0.2 -- Recorded timesheet for first 0.6 hours of the day (Nonbillable) 0.1 -- Went to bathroom, thought about case (Billable) 0.1 -- Washed my hands (Nonbillable) 0.1 -- Reviewed billable hours from yesterday (Nonbillable) 0.3 -- Proofread something I wrote yesterday (Billable) 0.3 -- Proofread it again (Billable) 0.3 -- Proofread it a third time (Billable) 0.3 -- Proofread my billable hours log (Nonbillable) 4.5 -- Lunch 0.2 -- Bathroom 0.4 -- Talk to other summer associates about lunch, compared notes, decided what restaurants to seek out in the near future 0.2 -- Bathroom 0.2 -- Bathroom 2.5 -- Lunch II [end of day]

      On the subway this morning, I noticed an advertisement.  It was for a community college of some sort, but the words in the ad were arranged poorly.  They were sort of on a diagonal, but at first, as I read from left to right, something seemed wrong:  TAKE CHANGE   CONTROL YOUR LIFE  Which is fine advice, and perhaps speaks to the state of opportunities in this economy for people with degrees from community college.  But I thought was a poor market message.  Read top to bottom instead:  TAKE CONTROL   CHANGE YOUR LIFE  Somehow that seems to make more sense.

      Okay, yesterday's sketch was part of a decision I made to exercise my sketch-writing muscle a little bit more.  So there will be more for the next little while, along with the usual randomness, and they will hopefully get consistently funnier and better.  Last night as I was falling asleep I scrawled down a few ideas.   Excerpts from new FOX shows featuring Simon Cowell as judge   "Birthing Idol" [Lights up on a woman in labor, pushing and screaming.] SIMON: I just don't like the head on this one. SIMON: I've never seen anything so dreadfully ugly. SIMON: That was a dismal performance.  And your gown is hideous. SIMON: You're bloody covered in blood.  Awful. SIMON: One baby is simply not enough to win this competition.  I'm sorry. SIMON: A boy, a girl, and a sandwich.  This is what this competition is all about.  "Homeless Idol" [Lights up on homeless people.] SIMON: You stink.  Quite literally, you stink. SIMON: I wouldn't give you a nickel for that performance, I really wouldn't. SIMON: That performance makes me want to find all of the other homeless people homes, because there's no way any of them can actually be worse than you. SIMON: Your box isn't even staying together. Pathetic. SIMON: You are literally freezing to death.  This is what Homeless Idol is all about.  Congratulations.  "Simon Cowell Judging the Special Olympics" SIMON: That was special.  Specially horrible. SIMON: If your IQ were any lower, you'd be Paula Abdul." SIMON: Did you really come here thinking you were the best handicapped child in the country?  Because if you did, then maybe you're in worse shape than it seems. SIMON: Can't walk?  Forget it.  You're awful. SIMON: You are drooling on my shoes, but you have star quality.  YOU are a special child.  "Simon Cowell at a Nursing Home" SIMON: Shouldn't you already be dead? SIMON: I just aged ten years waiting for you to get out of the bathroom.  Eighty more and we'll almost be even. SIMON: I hope you're close to the end, because otherwise that was just terrible. SIMON: I've seen better talent in the morgue. SIMON: No teeth?  But you can sing regardless?  You are why this TV show exists.

      "You Working On Anything?"  [Lights up in a young lawyer's office.  Computer, lots of paper, nice window view, perhaps a rotting corpse in the corner.  Lawyer is playing solitaire.  You can tell it's solitaire because he's transfixed on the screen and clicking the mouse.  And because he's alone.  Let's call him Fred.]  FRED Come on, black queen.  Give me a black queen.  [LAURA, a slightly older lawyer, is suddenly in the doorway.]  LAURA Looking at interracial gay porn again?  FRED No, just solitaire.  LAURA You working on anything?  FRED Billing code 4123-dash-8.  LAURA What's that?  FRED Bathroom.  LAURA Oh.  I billed an hour for that this morning.  FRED Bored too?  LAURA No.  Mexican.  FRED Gotcha.  LAURA SO you want to help me out with something?  FRED Sure.  LAURA Great.  You're gonna hate this.  It's what we gave paralegals until they unionized and demanded we stop in their latest contract negotiations.  FRED I heard about those.  Is that why the paralegals make more than I do?  LAURA No.  They make more than you because they get overtime when they stay until midnight.  FRED I just get free take-out and a car home.  LAURA Not anymore.  Cars only after 2 AM.  And take-out's only breakfast.  FRED Great.  So what's the job?  LAURA Well, I've got fourteen cartons of paper that were just delivered from the paper factory.  Imagine, a paper factory getting sued and the case demanding a document review.  A paper factory.  FRED Like an electric chair manufacturer getting sentenced to death.  LAURA I hope you do a rotation through the punchline department this summer, because that one died.  FRED Did you mean that to be a pun?  LAURA If you're asking, I guess I need some continuing legal education classes myself.  FRED So you want me to go through the cartons looking for relevant material.  LAURA That's the second step.  FRED What's the first?  LAURA Translating it all from Arabic.  FRED It's in Arabic?  LAURA You think they speak English in Minnesota?  FRED Yeah, I thought they did.  LAURA Not at this company.  They make paper.  They speak Arabic.  And they used these cartons as spitoons for their chewing tobacco.  So you might want to wear gloves.  FRED Wouldn't it make sense to get someone who speaks Arabic to do this?  LAURA Does anything we do make sense?  FRED Good point.  So where should I start?  LAURA Probably with the box marked "1".  FRED At least they use our numbers.  LAURA That's looking on the bright side.  At least you've got a good attitude.  That's one of the things we look for.  FRED What are the others?  LAURA Intelligence, drive, and an inability to say no.   FRED I said no to twelve other firms to come here.  LAURA Then it's out of your system.  FRED When do you need this by?  LAURA Friday.  FRED And then you'll have something rewarding for me to work on?  LAURA Probably not, but you can always hope.  FRED Except on Tuesdays.  LAURA Right, I see you read the rules.  FRED Twice.  LAURA Phlegm.  FRED Phlegm?  LAURA It means good luck in Arabic.  FRED No it doesn't.  LAURA Are you sure?  FRED No.  LAURA Okay then.  Phlegm.  FRED Phlegm.  [Laura exits.  Lights out.]

      Today I had computer training, which is about how it sounds.  Despite hopes for something disastrous and/or uproariously funny to happen, just to make the day more interesting, it was all pretty normal.  Thus I'm forced to think outside the box for something to write about.  This, I'm sure, has nothing to do with the firm, but the elevators in the building have little screens that show news, weather, sports, etc while you're riding up or down.  It strikes me as a little bit sad.  Not that it's not nice to have something to read, but is 45 seconds in an elevator really too long to go without some sort of stimulus?  I don't mind 45 seconds of contemplation in the elevator, solitary thought or reflection... but apparently society doesn't have time for that anymoe and we need elevator entertainment.  Gosh.  5 strange people I saw on the subway yesterday or today:  1. Woman with big visible neck tattoo 2. Man with fluorescent blinking cell phone lights 3. Woman with Slim Jim sticking out of her purse. 4. Man reading math textbook and mouthing the words to himself as he read 5. Woman who kept had both of her hands on the pole and was rubbing them around -- as if the pole was not something to be avoided at all costs.

      Hello (perhaps) to the one person in my summer class who mentioned he's read this; and, who knows, of course hello to anyone else in my summer class who reads this, although I'm guessing it's probably just the one.  Today, really, the firm did nothing but validate that I made a perfectly reasonable choice when choosing between firms.  I met lots of people I think I like, real lawyers and other summer associates, and none of the forms we filled out or things we saw on our tour threw up any red flags like "this a cult," "these people are monsters," or "evil is lurking everywhere."  My usual concern about these first-day things -- in any context, not just this one specifically -- is that I'm usually awfully quiet at first, that I take a little while to get comfortable and adjust, and fear that it comes off as unfriendly or something, when really I'm just nervous and shy -- but I feel like, for me, I did relatively okay today, and ended up talking to a bunch of people and at least trying reasonably hard to be outgoing and meet people and engage.  And I met a bunch of nice people.  I honestly have nothing but positive things to say about the day, within the confines that the first day of work is never really going to involve more than adminstrative stuff, anywhere, and so how thrilling can it really be.  But that's nothing unexpected, and I have nothing but nice things to say.    First we filled out forms.  Here's a mix of forms we filled out with forms I'm making up:  1. I-9 immigration form 2. W-2 tax form 3. Denial of liability in case of nuclear attack 4. Emergency contact form 5. Prohibition on insider trading 6. Prohibition on sexual harassment 7. Prohibition on tank tops 8. Prohibition on misplaced commas 9. Prohibition on surfing the web for porn 10. Prohibition on surfing the web not for porn  Then we got offices.  I have a nice view.  After lunch we took a tour of the building.  Here's a mix of things I saw and things I'm making up:  1. The elevator bank 2. The nice view from the reception area 3. The records office, which has automatic stacks of shelving that can crush someone to death. 4. The library, which has manual stacks of shelving that can crush someone to death. 5. Bruno, the security guard who can crush someone to death. 6. Petty cash 7. Petty theft 8. Deceased race car driver Richard Petty 9. The office that coordinates the secretary pool 10. The indoor swimming pool 11. The pool table 12. Word processing 13. The stapling center 14. The Staples Center 15. The center of a gigantic stapler 16. The cream-filled center of a gigantic Oreo 17. The Taxicopter, which is a tax form combined with a helicopter.  Use your imagination.  Then we had a reception, which had food that I couldn't imagine eating since lunch was big and recent.  64 more days!

      Expectations for the summer, before the job starts:  1. I expect to learn just how many shades of blue there are.  I don't mean sadness.  I mean blue like in dress shirts.  I expect to see lots of blue shirts, all similar but subtly different from each other.  I expect it will be a real education. In blueshirtness.  I own 4 blue dress shirts right now.  If I were to give each of them a name, they would be "Shiny Blue," "Textured Light Blue," "Dark Blue," and "Blue I think is blue but a bunch of people told me it was gray."  But I expect to also learn what "Bright Blue," "Powder Blue," "Electric Blue," "Striped Blue," "Pinstriped Blue," "Blue with white collar," "Used to be blue but ended up with the whites in the laundry and got bleached," "Wishes it was blue but is really sort of pink," "Stained blue," "Sky blue," "Hole in the collar blue," and "Magic marker blue" all look like too. I'll be keeping a list.  2. I expect to be able to more fully articulate the differences between Lexis and Westlaw, what one has and the other hasn't, which one gives better free assistance over e-mail, the pricing differences, which one has a more enthusiastic sales rep, which provides better training, which is more likely to lead me on wild-goose-searches where I end up finding interesting news articles about people I went to elementary school with, which is the more "sensitive" legal research service, what the difference between a Boolean and Natural Language search is, how many digits of my Westlaw password I can memorize without my brain exploding, which is more forgiving of rookie mistakes like selecting the wrong court system to look in, which loads faster, and which smells better.  3. I expect to participate in a lot of summer associate events, in fact probably the same number and exactly the same type as my friends at other firms around the city.  In fact, I expect to see large packs of summer associates from other firms leaving Wolfgang Puck's "Le Hamsterie" right as my firm's group is entering; sitting next to us at the Yankees game (where Gary Sheffield will have been expressly instructed to hit a foul ball directly into our section so that one lucky summer associate gets to go home with a souvenir.  Yankee tickets bought by the law firm: free; Concessions bought by the law firm: free; Gary Sheffield hitting a foul ball right into your section: $100,000 check from the law firm to Gary Sheffield; if that really happens: priceless); down the row at Wicked: The Musical; three lanes over at the bowling alley... oh, wait, lawyers don't go bowling.  Bowling is a blue-collar sport.  Lawyers, despite wearing blue shirts, only play white-collar sports, like accounting.  4. I expect to get tired of eating in nice restaurants, since I hear I will end up having a lot of nice lunches.  Which will actually be a shame, since eating in a nice restaurant should be a treat, not necessarily an everyday activity.  But it will be a nice shame, sort of.  Part of me thinks this all may be overblown and I'll actually get to make some lunch plans with friends in the city and not be "booked" every day with work-lunching.  But obviously until I start I have no idea.  The perfect business meal for a nice blue shirt: soup, pasta with red sauce, something parmagiana, and liquid chocolate raspberry spinning gyroscopes of staining liquid for dessert.  Or perhaps I'll just order the dry cereal with white rice, so even if I pour it all on my lap, I can still walk back to the office clean and ready for an afternoon on Lexisicing.    5. I expect to like it.  I mean, everyone says it's a lot of fun, I'll get to meet some students from other schools, meet some lawyers, figure out what it is lawyers do, go to some cool events and activities, eat in nice restaurants, see some things besides the inside of a classroom, really what's not to like.  Except for the sense that I'll be becoming "one of them."  But I suppose I did that when I sent in my law school deposit.  I don't know.  I guess I'm hoping that not all lawyers live up (down?) to the generic lawyer reputations, although really many of the people I met during the interview process seemed like very nice people, so I don't really think I should be concerned.  But I don't know.  And not knowing what to expect kind of makes the anticipation fun.  A little bit.

      I saw "Mean Girls" tonight.  I didn't much like it.  I thought I'd like it more.  UPDATED SUNDAY MORNING: Okay, why didn't I like it?  Well, it didn't feel particularly grounded in any sort of reality.  Every character was enough of an exaggeration of what the actual "type" might be that, to me, they ceased to be human beings and there was no thread with which to relate.  So there were all of these caricatures populating the movie, each with a goal of his or her own, and the interaction just wasn't there.  It touched no emotional place, no genuine nugget of feeling.  And so all these caricatures existing in their own little worlds limited the potential for funny.  The laughs were on one-liner jokes thrown in, and not the more satisfying laughs from situations that are funny and build on the character funny.  It just wasn't a satisfying movie, on really any level.  I can't imagine the book off of which it was conceived is as shallow as the movie, and says, basically, just that some girls -- The Plastics -- are the royalty of the high school and everyone else is in awe of them or hates them.  There had to be more.  And I thought the movie was going to do more -- a little while with The Plastics, and then some time with the Fat Girls, or whoever... but it never got away from its first step.  So, just not satisfying.  I feel dumb for having wanted to see it.  That's not a good feeling to leave the theater with -- dumb for having wanted to see the movie.  I think Tina Fey is better than this movie, but that something must have gotten derailed along the way, where someone wanted one movie and someone else wanted another movie, and it ended up like this.  I don't know.  It's not an utter disaster, there's some moments that are entertaining, but it just hangs together as a bunch of disconnected exaggerated characters that don't do anything worth watching.

       Okay, so you're going to law school in the fall...   ...and this is your last summer of freedom.  I know I've posted about this stuff before, but since the academic year is over, and there are all sorts of college grads now looking forward to wasting three years of their lives and $120,000 just so they can work 20-hour days in white-collar sweatshops, I figure now is as appropriate time as any to try and formulate some sort of summer-before-law-school advice, all wrapped up in a neat little bow.  Ten tips for law students-to-be.  Not to be taken completely seriously, because maybe I'm just trying to be funny.  Maybe I'm serious.  I don't even know anymore.  1. Come up with a neat little 90-second answer to the question, "Why are you in law school?"  Whether it's real or invented doesn't matter, it's just that you're going to be asked this question eight hundred times for the next three years, so you may as well figure out something to say.  "I want to help people" will get you laughed out of orientation.  "I want to help people who are fairly rich become moderately richer" is a little bit better.  "I want to help myself" is probably the best one of all.  2. Write yourself a note.  I've seen this advice before, but I can't remember where.  So I'm stealing it.  But my conscience can live with it.  Write yourself a note all about the high-minded goals you've got going in.  "I'm going to use my law degree to work for Greenpeace and make sure evil politicians don't burn down all the forests and dig for oil in all of the nation's public housing projects."  Whatever your dreams are, your idealistic reasons for joining some of America's most successful standardized test takers, write them down, put them in an envelope, seal the envelope, and give it to someone you trust.  Then, three years from now, you can look back and cry.  3. Stop imagining that law school is so different from everything else you've ever done before.  If you're going to law school, you probably didn't completely screw up college.  Law school's a lot more like college than, say, a job is.  If you survived college, you'll survive law school.  Heck, if you enjoyed college, you'll probably even enjoy law school.  Yes, you need to read a bunch of stuff every week.  No, this will not be the most grueling three years you've ever experienced, it will not require you cut off contact with your family and friends, it will not require you radically change your lifestyle and force yourself into a miserable existence because you don't think you'll pass Torts otherwise.  It's school, you know how to do school, just put in the hours you end up needing to out in, which will probably be fewer than you fear, and you'll be fine.  This is not some sort of radically different paradigm.  4. Go on your school's website and look at the extracurricular activities.  Find some you're interested in.  If you're really interested in them, track down someone involved in them and shoot them an e-mail.  They'll be happy to know you.  Thinking even broader, find out some stuff in the city you'll be in that you might enjoy doing and see if you can lay the groundwork for getting involved in that too.  Even if you do nothing and just keep some ideas in the back of your head come fall, it'll keep you from feeling like there's nothing outside of the classroom, your dorm room, and the library.  To stay sane you've got to do stuff you find fun and rewarding and fulfilling and satisfying.  Classes may be all of those things.  But you'll probably need more.  Don't be afraid to find more.  This is three years of your life.  You don't get any extra credit for being miserable.  5. Write a resume.  It will feel like it's much, much, much too soon in the fall when people start frantically looking for summer jobs.  If you already have a resume -- and maybe even the start of a cover letter -- it'll just be one less thing to have to deal with.  Plus everyone's going to ask you forty times a day if you wrote your resume yet, and this way you can say yes.  Anecdotal evidence indicates to me that what you do your summer after 1L year does not impact your 2L job search much if at all.  So don't worry if you don't get a law firm job and you're stuck working somewhere you'd rather not be.  You'll survive.  And, if faced with a choice between two jobs that won't have radically different impacts on your future, choose the one you're going to enjoy more even if it's the one you're more uncomfortable telling your classmates you've accepted.  They don't have to live your life, you do.  6. Resolve not to lose touch with everyone you know outside of law school.  Whether this means pledging to write e-mails, planning visits in advance, setting up a weekly dinner, starting a weblog... just make sure you have some sort of way to avoid getting so wrapped up in law school that you have nothing else.  Even if you like law school.  Because at some point law school isn't new anymore, and you're going to feel lonely, and want to reconnect.  So why lose touch in the first place.   The 3 years goes fast, and then what?  Don't lose the life and friends and hobbies and passions you have just because you're going to law school.  It's not worth it.  7. Buy big fluffy pillows, a comfortable desk chair, a working alarm clock, a bunch of highlighters, and a t-shirt with the name of your school on it.  The first four things are to maximize comfort and productivity.  The last is so that when you wander off in a law-induced stupor, someone will know where you belong and lead you back.  8. Ignore anyone who tries to tell you that some sort of week-long law school preparatory class is going to be anything more than a waste of money.  That includes ignoring the voices inside your own head that are telling you to go.  You won't get a "leg up" and, at worst, you'll be the jackass who keeps raising his hand because he knows the answer and everyone will hate you.  If you really want to get a head start, find a 3-page summary on the Internet of all of your classes, and read it.  You'll be more prepared than you need to be, but it won't turn you into "one of those people."  9. As soon as you find out what casebooks you're going to be using, go on half.com or Amazon used and buy them there.  They're much cheaper.  Also, befriend some law students and they'll give you their old study guides.  Not worth buying new.  Not worth buying at all, really (the study guides I mean -- your casebooks, unfortunately, really are worth buying, and reading, and even occasionally highlighting), but if you can get them for free, why not.  10. Have fun.  This is probably not your last summer of freedom, and it may not even be a summer of freedom at all, but it's still important to take advantage.  Law school may dull your personality, quash your creativity, and silence your passions.  So this may be the last time you're really you, and not some defanged, exhausted, and soul-less version of yourself.  So you should do the things you're afraid you won't ever do once you're in law school.  Write a novel.  Take a pottery class.  Make the world's longest paper clip chain.  However your spirit moves you.  Good luck.  And godspeed.

      I woke up this morning, and I can't believe I've finished two years of law school.  It seems like I just started.  It goes by quickly.  Especially the most recent semester, because by now nothing much is new, and so you get into a routine and time just flies.    I'm contemplating a post here, and I'm not sure exactly what I want it to say.  On Monday I start my summer job, which hasn't gotten much attention on here since the fall recruiting season, mostly because once they hire you, there's not that much to do until you start working there.  I've already mentioned I'm in New York.  So that limits the universe to about 4,000 places I could be.  I have no idea if anyone at the firm I'll be at reads this already, or even knows it exists.  I've got to believe someone has seen it -- if not someone at the firm, then someone in my summer class.  Regardless, obviously I write as if they're reading every word.  Which, and maybe this is naive, I honestly don't think changes anything, since most of the things I think about and find myself wanting to write about are riffs on reality, and on the insignificant details, not to write Ron Suskind's "The Price of Loyalty" and try to bring down an administration.  Frankly, lately I don't feel I've been writing tons of things that are particularly relevant, and interesting, and thought-provoking, and insightful.  Maybe I never have been, but I didn't notice it.  And hopefully you've enjoyed what I've been writing regardless.  I hope you have.  But part of me, perhaps naively, feels like this summer gig, at least by being something new and different and interesting, will give me lots of neat new things to say, and breathe some exciting new life into this weblog thing.  Two years ago, when I started this, there were not nearly as many law students with weblogs as there are now.  People can find out what life is like... pretty much everywhere.  But I'm not sure I've seen a ton of summer associate stories.  So what I'm saying is that I want to give you something cool here.  I want to be a destination.  I want to offer something no one else is.  So I will try.  I may not succeed.  But I will try.  I've read a decent number of weblog posts that say people are writing for themselves.  In a way I'm writing for myself.  In a bigger way I'm writing for an audience.  In a way, this whole thing has been an experiment to see if I can build an audience, and if I have interesting things to say.  I've built a little bit of an audience.  This, to me, feels like the point where I say: stick with me.  Not because I'm asking you to, but because I'm going to make this worth your three minutes to read it every day.  Or at least I'm going to try.  I don't what the point of this whole post is.  But one of the interesting things about weblogs is the potential for every three days to be a meaningful moment of some sort: it's either your birthday, your weblog's anniversary, your 1000th post, your 100000th visitor, the end of a semester, the beginning of a festival, or the demarcation of some other significant life event.  And everything feels worthy of a self-reflective, 800-word creation.  Ah, isn't it beautiful.  I think I have some never-before-written law school advice posts churning in my head for the weekend.  But on Monday I step into a law firm office for the first time not as one seeking a job, but one, uh, seeking a job?  I honestly don't really know what to expect.  I've heard stories, but do I really believe them?  Do I really think they take us out for 2-hour lunches every day?  I kind of hope they don't, since I'd hate for a good meal to become such a habit that I can't enjoy it.  If you've gotten all the way down here, you deserve some links.  If you're still taking exams, or even if you're not, read  urlLink Waddling Kitchen  for some ideas about what to eat.  He writes about food well.  If you want to know my pre-law-firm conception of a good supervising attorney, see  urlLink here .  For a bad one, see  urlLink here .

      All done.  2L year's over.  And I'm back in New York.  And I'm annoyed that I threw away my Tax code-list, because it was going to make my odd idea for a post really easy to write.  I'm going to try anyway.   Conversation Between Tax Lawyers At The Watercooler   1: I'm sorry for your 165. 2: Thanks.  Although it had really been a 129 for a while. 1: I heard she was a real 74. 2: Maybe.  But she had a real problem with 40. 1: 163ing.  I never heard that. 2: We kept it quiet.  She was in and out of 111. 3: Hey, hey, hey!  Guess who had a date last night? 1: Thought it would be a nice day, and 63s you. 2: Yeah, you're 61. 1: That girl was probably just making a 170. 2: I bet she needs 104 after whatever you did to her. 1: Yeah, because spending time with you is a 183 for sure. 3: Hey, hey, at least I had a date and wasn't getting 73. 1: That's 61! 2: Yeah! 1: I wish 101 on you. 2: That goes double for me. 3: Sorry, sorry.  I just came by to get some milk for my coffee.  Have you seen the 67? 1: All we have is skim. 2: Try the 125. 3: Thanks. [he exits] 1: It would be a 132 to lose him. 2: Definitely.

      This is becoming a pattern, isn't it?  The early morning post about my exam in just an hour and fifteen minutes.  Well, this is the last one.  I have a marvelous idea for a post all about Tax, but not the energy to write it yet, so look for that later today or maybe tomorrow.  At some point in the next 24 hours I head back to NY for the summer, now that the weather has turned nice here in Cambridge.  There are people from my tax class without earshot in the library puzzling over something I should be puzzling over but instead am writing a weblog post.  Oh well.  We have 4 hours, I have the tax code, I have my notes, if I can't find it and figure it out during the exam, well, then I deserve whatever grade I get.  Like that excuse as to why I'm not puzzling over the interaction between 1231 and 1245 and 1221?  Yeah, me neither.  I think I'm going to press "publish" and start puzzling.

       Diary of an Exam   Tuesday, 3:00 PM -- I was born as the 23rd photocopy in the basement of the law school and was added to a large stack.  I'm a twin!  There are 132 of us, plus one who's missing his back page (birth defect) and a few who are lopsided.  Tuesday, 4:00 PM -- Overwhelmed by the smell of toner, I passed out.  I awoke to find myself still in the same pile.  Wednesday 7:45 AM -- An elderly gentleman put me and my brothers in a box and carried us somewhere.  He smelled like sour milk.  Wednesday 8:30 AM -- The box was put down in what seemed to be a classroom.  Nervous students gathered around me, as I waited for the elderly gentleman to give me to my new owner.  This must have been what the slaves felt like.  Wednesday 8:36 AM -- My new owner is treating me badly.  He's abusive.  He folded me in half.  It really hurts.  And I'm being crushed by his laptop computer in his backpack.  This isn't fair.  I miss my box.  Wednesday 8:44 AM -- We have arrived at his apartment.  It smells like sour milk.  He burned me with coffee.  I hate him.  Wednesday 8:52 AM -- He's writing on me.  I hope it's not permanent.  Mom told me I should never get a tattoo because I'll regret it when I'm old and wrinkled and grayish-white.  Wednesday 10:15 AM -- We've been here a long time.  I don't know what's going on.  He's looking at other papers.  He likes them better than me.  I tried to get his attention by making myself fall on the floor but he ignored me.  Wednesday, 10:42 AM -- I'm still on the floor.  He hasn't noticed.  Wednesday 10:50 AM -- OUCH!  His chair just ran over me.  That's gonna leave a mark.  And no medical attention.  Crap.  Wednesday 11:15 AM -- Okay, he just picked me up and he's reading me again.  His palms are sweaty.  It's kind of disgusting.  Wednesday 12:02 PM -- More writing.  It doesn't even look like English.  Wednesday 1:12 PM -- He RIPPED me!  He TORE a piece from me!  And wrapped his chewing gum in it and threw it out.  That was my spleen, mister!  Wednesday 3:30 PM -- I'd heard the rumors but I never thought it would actually happen to me: I've been STAPLED to some fresh-out-of-the-printer exam wannabes.  He calls them his "answers," whatever that means.  Mom told me never to get my ears pierced.  This must be what it feels like.  Wednesday 4:30 PM -- Box, sweet box.  I'm back with my friends.  We've all been stapled.  I hope we're not being taken to a concentration camp now.  Wednesday 7:21 PM -- The room is dark; it smells like feet; in comes an older man with an unkempt beard and unmatching clothes.  Must be a professor.  He takes the box.  I am apparently going on a trip somewhere.  Wednesday 9:11 PM -- The professor has a nice house.  Hope he leaves the TV on.  Porn.  Wednesday 9:49 PM -- No porn, but there's a whole ream of paper in the corner -- NAKED!  And posing just for me.  You look sexy, blank paper.  Although it's a little too thick for me.  I prefer 12 lb and this is 15.  Friday 1:12 PM -- Touch me, professor!  Touch me!  Oh, how I long to be touched!  Six weeks later, Friday, 4:07 AM -- Touch me, professor!  Touch me!  It's been so long since anyone has touched me!  Saturday, 11:12 AM -- Finally, my needs are being tended.  Yeah, scratch right there, by the staple.  No, a little bit to the left.  Yeah, that's it, that's it, don't stop.  Saturday, 11:14 AM -- Why are you writing on me with RED pen?!  What do I look like??  Who do you think you are??  Saturday, 11:19 AM -- So the rumors are true.  I've just been thrown down a flight of stairs to see where I land.  Apparently I'm a B+.  So is everyone else in the box.  Sunday, 10:01 PM -- It's been a long and fruitful life, but I am at the point of no return.  The Hefty Bag on the curb.  There's no turning back.  I'm ready to go with God.  Take me when you're ready.  Monday, 6:02 AM -- He's ready.  Garbage truck approaching.  Monday, 6:04 AM -- NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!  Monday, 8:13 AM -- I am nearly dead.  A first-year law student approaches, picking through the McDonalds' wrappers and empty tubes of hemorrhoid cream.  He picks me up.  He wipes me off.  I am now -- I believe -- a study aide.  My parents would be so proud.

      Here's an  urlLink article  from Monday's Boston Globe about webloggers getting press credentials for the Democratic Convention.  It mentions  urlLink Pandagon , which is a pretty cool site for political news and views (and I'm not just saying that because they linked to my Democratic Debate Parody a while back), and which I didn't realize was written by a 21-year-old and a 19-year-old.  Gosh.  I feel old.

      Okay, exam #2 is over.  One more to go, and that's Tax, and it's tomorrow.  21 hours until I am finished for a while.  Well, until Monday, when I start my summer gig, but let's not get ahead of ourselves here... still got to figure out what section 1045 recapture means.  As I was walking over to pick up the exam this morning -- 8:30 this morning -- I passed about eight or ten different people, also on their way to get exams, all drinking Starbucks Frappucinos.  At 8:30 in the morning.  With the whip cream and caramel syrup and everything.  Caffeinated breakfast of champions I guess.  I had an Odwalla Carrot/Apple/Orange juice, which is awfully tasty, and a donut, which wasn't so much.  That was my entire intake until I gave in the exam and went to grab a sandwich.  At 10:30, 2 hours in, the fire alarm in my building went off.  Again.  (It went off last night too.)  So I went to the library for the rest of the exam and did it there.  Didn't notice much of a difference.  8-hour exams aren't any fun no matter where you take them.   Top Eleven Beverages of Choice (although not my choice) Preceding An 8-Hour-Exam   1. Starbucks Frappucino 2. Dunkin' Donuts Iced Latte 3. Red Bull 4. Protein Shake with Wheatgrass 5. Wheatgrass Shake with Protein 6. Mountain Dew with two tablespoons of sugar added 7. Mountain Dew Code Black 8. Mountain Dew flavored Starbucks Frappucino 9. Mountain Dew flavored Starbucks Frappucino mixed with Red Bull, extra whip cream 10. Cookie Dough (I'm stealing the joke from an old SNL commercial parody -- Cookie Dough as a sports drink.) 11. The Blood of a Young Child

      8-hour exam starts in 25 minutes.  Communications Law.  On the way to the student center, I passed a stray flier on the ground.  "Summer Jobs for the Environment."  I thought it was ironic, lying on the ground.  Maybe not.  See you in 8 hours.

      I love the vaudeville routine after every exam -- the "I really want to talk about the exam, but I really don't want to talk about the exam" act that everyone puts on that leads to impossibly vague conversations that do nothing but raise questions.  1: "So... not, uh, terrible, right?" 2: "No, no, it was, uh... not terrible." 1: "On the long one---" 2: "No, no, no substance." 1: "No, just, the long one was not obvious, right?" 2: "No, I didn't think it was obvious." 1: "And the practice exam didn't really..." 2: "I don't know, I don't want to talk about it." 1: "But for the one with the clown... did you use up all the word limit?" 2: "No, no, not even close." 1: "Good, good." 2: "There were a bunch where you had answers that were pretty much the same, right?" 1: "I don't know about a bunch, but more than one, sure." 2: "And you were pretty confident about that?" 1: "Reasonably, I guess." 2: "There was quite a bit of... reading... in the second part." 1: "Yeah, and I was kind of amused by the little trick." 2: "The little trick?" 1: "Yeah, on the third... oh wait, you didn't see the little trick?" 2: "What little trick?  No, don't tell me." 1: "It wasn't-- It wasn't that big of a deal, just the way the statute--" 2: "No, no... you opened the statute?" 1: "Yeah, a couple of times." 2: "I just used my notes." 1: "I was going to just use my notes, but then that question with the apricots, and there was nothing--" 2: "The hypothetical from class--" 1: "I don't know.  Stop, I don't want to know." 2: "Okay, okay.  But certainly the moral of that whole exam was Rule 92.  Rule ninety-freakin-two." 1: "92?  What?  What in the world is Rule 92?" 2: "Nevermind.  I didn't mean to--" 1: "Yeah, I don't want to--" 2: "Let's get some lunch." 1: "Okay."

      Exam this morning was... reasonable.  Two more to go.  I've written before about proctors, the elderly folks who hand out and collect the exams.  Today, however, was a first.  One proctor announced, as he began to read the instructions, "Good morning, my name is John [something].  I am the HEAD proctor for this exam.  My two ASSISTANT proctors will be handing out the exams as I read these instructions verbatim."  He emphasized HEAD and ASSISTANT very much so.  This guy was on a freaking power trip because he was the HEAD of the three-person team assigned to hand out law school exams.  Insane.  At one point, he said, as if anyone cared: "You may notice that the green attendance cards, if you have the new ones, ask for your last name first now.  Note the change."  Maybe he got appointed to the HEAD proctor position by taking note of details like that.  "I will write the time on the board at regular intervals, whenever I remember."  Thanks.  He really said that.  "But, as always, the time will be kept officially by the clock."  By the clock?  But you're the HEAD proctor!?!?!  Shouldn't the HEAD proctor keep the OFFICIAL time?  Okay, clearly I've gone insane.   I'm in the library right now, and there's a sign right by the computers:   Please be advised!!!  The computers in the library are experiencing random rebooting.  The issue is being worked on.  SAVE YOUR WORK FEQUENTLY TO DISK!!!!!!!  5-02-04  Library Automation Department A few questions raised:  1) What in the world is the "Library Automation Department"??? 2) Why can't they spell-check??? ("Fequently") 3) What in the world makes computers randomly reboot??? 4) Why so many exclamation points???   urlLink Scheherazade  has an uber-cool post about interviewing a new lawyer for a job at her firm and how young lawyers, without even knowing it, run the risk of becoming "one of them."  I may be grossly mischaracterizing her post.  Go read it and find out for yourself.  I need to post fast, before the computer randomly reboots or the HEAD proctor finds me and cuts off my HEAD.

       Stream of consciousness one hour and ten minutes before corporations exam   Why did I think I needed an hour to eat a danish, check my e-mail, and set my fantasy baseball lineups before my exams, when I really only needed ten minutes, and I could have done it after the exam anyway?  I know rule 14-e-3 applies to tender offers only, but I'm not sure what it applies to tender offers only.  I hope it doesn't start raining, since I left my umbrella home.  Should I go to the bathroom again before my exam?  Is there any way to get the song stuck in my head out of my head before the exam?  Did I forget anything?  Will my disk work?  Should I have eaten more than a danish?  Should I check again which room my exam is in?  I could have read it wrong, I suppose, although I did just check this morning.  Should I really be writing a weblog post an hour and six minutes before my exam?  Is there any more corporations I can possibly learn?  Should I abbreviate business judgment rule as BJR on the exam to make it seem like I'm more comfortable with this language than I really am, or should I just write the whole thing out?  Should I just play it by ear based on how close to the word count I am?  Is this post funny?  If it isn't should I post it anyway?  I feel like I'm wasting time, but don't know how to actually be productive doing anything an hour before my exam.  I like Blogger's new interface.  That was random.  I think I know the person sitting down the row at the computer cluster but I'm not sure.  Does it matter?  He's probably wasting time before an exam too.  Do Revlon duties apply if he board doesn't actually want to sell but thinks it's being forced into it?  I'm yawning.  Did I not sleep enough?  Was watching the first half-hour of Charlize Theron's episode of Iside the Actor's Studio really worth sacrificing a half-hour of sleep?  Has Charlize Theron really done enough to merit an episode of Inside the Actor's Studio?  Are they running out of actors?  Is there actually an apostrophe in Actor's on the show, and if there is, is it after the S instead of before?  Actors'?  Actor's?  Actors?  We used to call female actors actresses anyway, right?  Was there some definied point where that switched?  Like the defined point where we switch to Revlon duties?  That just sort of fell together, that returning back to corporations seamlessly thing.  I didn't plan to make Revlon relevant again after my little Inside the Actors' Studio bit.  Hmmm.  Interesting.  Yawning again.  Not good.  Glad the exam is only two hours.  And starts in 59 minutes.  Maybe I should go to the room it's in and stare at my outline.  That would be more productive than this.  Yeah, that's what I'll do.  Okay, stopping now. Really, I am.  Done.  Done.  Done.  Done.  Done!

      Saw the end of the Survivor finale, and the reunion show afterwards, even though I hadn't seen any episodes of this season's Survivor.  But it was still sort of interesting.  Made the season seem pretty interesting, though I hadn't seen any of it.    After the break: a new twist.  We'll be decapitating one of the 18 Survivors on national television... and Amber will get to choose who it is.  Come on Amber, you've got ten seconds to make your choice!  Amber: I choose Rob, since I only said yes to the proposal because I thought he was going to win the million dollars.  Now that I've won, I don't want to share it.  [audience cheers]  [end of Survivor stuff]  Had a conversation with a friend today about potential law firm orientation activities, like if they do stuff like play "two truths and a lie" with the summer associates.  Bad ideas if they do:  >>Making racist comments.  ("I'm actually Chinese!")  >>Admitting awkward personal stuff.  ("I was raped!"  "Last night!"  "By the guy next to me!")  >>Saying stuff that makes it sound like you don't really want to be there.  ("My goal in life is to be a stripper!")  Exam in 11 hours.  Corporations.  The practice exams all have fact patterns based on old movies -- Casablanca, Alfred Hitchcock, etc.  I'm hoping this year's will be based on Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ.  "A bystander learns of Jesus's impending crucifixion and buys stock in the local wood plank and nail companies.  Is he liable under 10-b-5?"  "A corporation is started by The Jews.  Aren't they all?"  "Jesus buys stock, dies, and then, within 6 months, is resurrected, and sells his stock at a profit.  Has he violated Rule 16-b?"

      The Yahoo Fantasy Baseball interface is fine, but this year they eliminated the "are you sure you wanna..." dialog box... and I just accidentally dropped Juan Uribe instead of Rafael Furcal.  Clicked the wrong button.  Not a big deal, since Uribe's about to lose playing time with Valentin off the DL, and Furcal is sure to get back to health soon, but... wait, you don't care.  Sorry.

      I am back in Beantown.  My computer, sadly, isn't.  This morning it imploded before I left.  It had been doing weird stuff, but this morning it wouldn't boot.  Was able to borrow a laptop from a family friend to take back with me for exams this week (Thursday night I head back to NY for the summer) so I don't have to handwrite.  But computers, aren't they something.  Seems like everyone at Harvard has computer problems -- I'm not clear if that's the network's fault (everyone seems to get viruses) or what.  I have no idea.  But my borrowed computer stays off the network, and I'm e-mailing and blogging and all that jazz from the library for the week.  Which, actually, will probably make my studying at home a lot more productive, so I don't know that I'm complaining all that vociferously.  Anyway, enough about my computer!  On the Chinatown bus this evening, I was sitting next to a guy reading a book called "Survival in a Time of Crisis."  Frightening.  Not sure what crisis he was anticipating.  I saw "Avenue Q" on Broadway with a friend this afternoon before heading back up here.  Loyal readers will recall I wrote about the soundtrack a bunch of months back.  I liked the soundtrack.  The show was better than the soundtrack.  It was thoroughly entertaining.  Thoroughly.  I would say more, but if I say more, it will be all about me, and how seeing bad theater/TV/movies makes me feel better about my own skills and possibilities than seeing good theater/TV/movies.  But it's getting late, and I want to go watch Saturday Night Live so I can feel better about myself.

      I am disabused of the notion that I would get as much studying done at home as I would have at school.  Nonetheless, I'm really glad I came home for a few days, because it's been awesome seeing some friends and the  urlLink two   urlLink shows  I've seen.  And if costs me a third of a grade in Communications Law, I think I'm okay with that.  So there!  :)

      /Includible/ or /Includable/ ?? /Excludible/ or /Excludable/ ??  Maybe this bothers me more than it should, but my tax casebook can't decide, and neither can I.  I like them with the /a/ not the /i/, but I'm not sure if that's just personal preference, or I'm actually correct.

       Random thoughts on the "Friends" finale , which I just finished watching, thanks to the magic of videotape.  Keep in mind I haven't seen an episode of friends in at least two years, maybe more.  1. I wish they would have explained that Erica was a surrogate mom, because it took me the longest time to figure out who she was -- when Phoebe told Ross he was going to be an uncle, I guessed she was Chandler's sister, but I still didn't know why she was there and pregnant.  But then I finally figured it out. 2. Is Courteney Cox Arquette pregnant?  All of her shirts were untucked, and she looked normal-sized, but last time I saw her on TV she looked emaciated, so I'm guessing someone either did an intervention and forced her to stop throwing up, or she's pregnant.  Hopefully she's eating while pregnant or she's going to give birth to a skeleton. 3. Who's the dude who wants to get Phoebe pregnant?  I know in real life he's Paul Rudd, and was in "Wet Hot American Summer," a very funny movie, but I have no idea why he's on "Friends" and how he's related to Phoebe. 4. The second "muffin" line -- very predictable. 5. Who puts their boarding pass in their bag and buries it in there when they know they're going to have to show it in just a minute?  Of everything that didn't ring true in the episode (Ducks in the foosball table??) that was the biggest, and it was totally unnecessary too. 6. For about ten minutes before Phoebe called Rachel on the cell phone I was wondering why they hadn't called her -- why not right when he decided to go after her, like "stop the cab, where are you, I'll meet you there and we'll talk."  Stupid. 7. After the article I read yesterday about the lawsuit against the Friends writers I kept wondering when the scene with the [deleted for children's eyes] was coming up, and it never happened. 8. Why does Joey get a spinoff?  Watching Monica and Chandler raise those kids looks more interesting to me. 9. Wasn't there a funnier word than "flange" for the plane part? 10. Why couldn't they run into Frasier and his brother and they could all just say goodbye together?

      CNN has an interesting  urlLink article  about the sexual harassment suit filed against a bunch of writers for NBC's "Friends" by a former writers' assistant.  The complaint, which you can  urlLink read here  at the Smoking Gun website, talks about how the writers would discuss "[Courteney] Cox's fertility and love life, [David] Schwimmer's sexual preference... [and] how several writers spoke of their secret desire to turn the character Joey (played by Matt LeBlanc) into a serial rapist, discussing 'full scenes of how he would rape the women.' "  The argument being made by the attorneys for the writers is apparently that "the conduct was justified by 'creative necessity' " and that these stories were all part of the creative process in the TV writers' room.  "Context" is key, say the attorneys.  The CNN article, written by Hofstra Law Professor Joanna Grossman, says that context is often considered in these types of cases, and is "what differentiates a coach's slapping a football player on the behind after a game, from his doing the same thing to his secretary back at the office" but wonders if there really would be any need in the writers room to talk about what they'd like to do to Jennifer Aniston, complete with diagrams and demonstrated motions.  To me, it's hard to conceive of a television writers room as a normal workplace with normal rules about what ought and ought not be said, but I guess it is a workplace, and this stuff does matter.  I guess, despite thinking that the writers' conduct was probably inappropriate, I don't have much sympathy for the writers assistant suing over it.  What damage could it have really done, and why not just quit and get a different job if she didn't like it?  There are people who would have killed for her job -- and... I don't know... I know the right answer is what they did was stupid and inappropriate and no one should have to work in an environment like that, and it's bad and they should be punished.  And I believe that, really I do... but did they *really* do anything so terrible?  Haven't we all drawn lewd pictures of Jennifer Aniston...?

       urlLink Greg  has some advice about law school, framed as a comparison of law school and other grad schools.  Aside from mentioning that it's somewhat school-specific -- the grading where he is sounds a lot rougher than the grading here, where you have to mess up to get a B-, and apparently be virtually comatose to get a C (I've heard of them existing, I've seen them on a grade distribution curve from a '98 exam -- barely -- but I haven't even ever heard anyone say they know of someone who knows someone who got one) -- there's not a ton I have to say, since I haven't been to any other kind of grad school besides this one.  But I don't think law school is, or has to be, nearly as unpleasant as Greg makes it sound -- and maybe I'm spoiled because everyone here who wants a job gets one, and so I don't feel it's as competitive, and I don't feel like it's all that much different from undergrad in a lot of ways. More reading, less writing, don't fall too far behind on the reading, pray for a good day when you take the final... Greg's post makes it sound like grad school is very different from undergrad, with more group work, more "adults," more like work, a little bit, and less like school.  Which is interesting, and may not actually be counter to my contention that law school and undergrad aren't horribly dissimilar. I don't know.

      Since my last post, I've changed cities.  I'm in New York from now until Saturday, balancing studying with some more enjoyable stuff.  The  urlLink undergraduate theater group  I was part of has its spring production this weekend, which two of my friends are directing; and one of them is in  urlLink this off-Broadway production .  With the first of those happening only this weekend and the second one closing this weekend -- and no reason why I can't study just as well at home as at school (well...) -- I thought it was well worth the trip.    Also just wanted to acknowledge my friend and colleague Adam White's announcement of the hopefully-temporary end of his blogging days, due to a clerkship, and a wedding (one sounds like more fun than the other).  If you haven't been reading him at  urlLink White Noize ,  urlLink Ex Parte , or  urlLink Southern Appeal , well, it's too late now.  Although there are archives.  On the bus ride from Boston this afternoon, I balanced my Tax studying with the New Yorker's humor issue, which had been sitting on my shelf for a couple of weeks begging to be read.  If you haven't read it, look for it -- it's worth it.  Interesting articles on Aaron McGruder, creator of a comic strip called "Boondocks," Hallmark greeting card writers, politicians trying to be funny, The Farrelly Brothers' modern adaptation of the Three Stooges shorts, the lives of just-starting-out stand-up comedians in New York, and some other pieces which I liked less than these (or, heaven forbid, read the first couple of paragraphs and then skipped past) so I won't mention them.  I flagged a  page that mentioned that some of the best sellers among Hallmark cards are those that come from lots of people -- "Happy Mother's Day from the two of us," "Happy Birthday from the whole family," "Happy Anniversary from your husband and a bunch of his friends," etc. -- which gives me an idea for something, but I'll let it percolate for a day or two and see what happens.

       Book Review: "Give Me A Break" by John Stossel   Yes, I've actually been studying.  But if I spend a chunk of the day reading about law, sometimes I like to read for a little while before bed about something else.  So the last few days I've used John Stossel's "Give Me A Break" as my bedtime reading, and I've dreamt of government regulators getting assassinated and Congressmen falling down wells.  I like John Stossel.  His 20/20 pieces are usually interesting, colorful, and fun to watch.  The book chronicles his transformation from a consumer advocate, doing pieces about how, say, asbestos is hurting kids, to a libertarian, skeptical of government regulation of most kinds.  Basically, as he reported on more and more consumer dangers, he started to realize that the free market wasn't the problem, and private companies were more efficient than when government stepped in and tried to regulate, but ended up just making the problem worse, or pretending it was fixed when it wasn't.  "Government is inefficient" is the point Stossel's trying to sell.  The book is a breezy mix of anecdotes about stories he worked on and -- I'm looking for a less loaded word than this, but can't find it -- libertarian propaganda.  Done well, but clearly motivated by a certain point of view.  If you've seen his ABC News Specials, a lot of the topics in the book will sound familiar, because he's reported on them, and to some extent the book summarizes a bunch of those reports.  It's a fine book, and it's entertaining to read, but even if he's being completely fair and accurate, you get the sense while reading that he's playing fast and loose with the facts -- everything's definitive in here: breast implants are safe, dioxin is safe, organic foods are no healthier than regular food and in fact may be more dangerous because they have more bacteria, government handouts are bad, flood insurance is bad, high salaries for corporate CEOs are good, privatizing housing projects is good, banning smoking is bad, legalizing drugs is good... there's no nuance here, there's no ambiguity, no arguments on both sides of the issue... and maybe Stossel's decided there just aren't any good ones, and it's all so clear... but as entertaining as it is to basically say "libertarian ideas are right, and people who don't see it this way are just stupid and wrong and should be mocked," it doesn't feel completely satisfying.  I especially enjoyed his chapter, "The Trouble With Lawyers," which  urlLink tort lawyers  would likely find infuriating.  Lawsuits, Stossel writes, are like nuclear missiles -- "We need them... [but we should] try not to use them, because they harm innocent people."  They're expensive, people abuse them, lawyers make all the money, they deter innovation, they stop kids from playing Little League, drive up the cost of bicycle helmets, send companies who may have used asbestos but didn't harm anyone into bankruptcy, cost thousands of jobs, force McDonalds to serve cold coffee, destroy the innocent tobacco companies (because smokers, by dying early, don't actually cost us anything), close down businesses just because they're not wheelchair-accessible -- and the solution to all this?  "Loser pays."  That would fix it.  Very entertaining to read, sometimes even a little thought-provoking, but there's the depth of the analysis.  He has a point to make, he's trying very hard to make it, he makes it well -- but this is advocacy, not balance.  So, I'm not a libertarian, but I still enjoyed the book.  And maybe I take away from it a little bit more skepticism about government regulation than I had, and a few colorful anecdotes.  But it's fluff.  It's a breezy libertarian primer, playing loose with facts and nuance to make a point.  There's nothing *wrong* with that, I guess -- but somehow it's not completely satisfying.

       Real Conversation I Had With Woman At Sprint Store This Afternoon   Me: My phone battery has been holding its charge less and less lately.  I think I may need a new one. Her: Is your phone under warranty? Me: I don't know. Her: How old is it? Me: Maybe a year and a half. Her: The warranties are usually only one year.  So we'll say it's not. Me: Can you check? Her: [audible sigh] What's your phone number? Me: [phone number] Her: No, it's 2002.  That's 2 years ago.  It's not under warranty. Me: Okay... Her: If it was under warranty, we could test the battery and see if that's the problem.  Since it's not under warranty, we won't. Me: So how do I know if I need a new battery? Her: I'm not a technician. Me: Okay... so how do I know if I need a new battery? Her: If it was under warranty, we would test it. Me: Okay... Her: Batteries for that phone are $60. Me: That's more than the phone cost. Her: That's what the battery costs. Me: Is it cheaper to get a new phone then? Her: Do you want a battery or a phone? Me: I've had the phone for 2 years I guess.  Is there a point at which I can a rebate on a new one? Her: I'm not a technician. Me: Okay... Her: Let me see if we have any of the batteries in stock.  [she goes away and comes back almost instantly with a battery] Here.  It's $60. Me: Are the batteries cheaper elsewhere? Her: How would I know? Me: Is there any way to know if it's the battery that's the problem, and if I replace the battery it'll hold the charge longer? Her: If it was under warranty we would test the battery. Me: But you won't test the battery now, even though I would buy a new battery. Her: Right. Me: Do you think it's the battery? Her: I'm not a technician. Me: Okay. Her: Do you need anything else? Me: I think I'm going to wait, and see if I can get the battery cheaper elsewhere. Her: Thank you for shopping at Sprint.  Bizarre.

       "The Duty of Care" to the tune of "The Circle of Life"  (can you tell what I've been studying?)  The directors make many decisions And some of them end in regret Mistakes have been made, the price must be paid But what justice can the shareholders get?  Some say vote them out by proxy Some say just let it go But what most of them do, is decide they will sue But the Delaware court tells them "no!"  Chorus: It's the duty of care It's the business judgment If you act in faith They can't pierce the veil Just because you're dumb And you lost a fortune You're not liable; it's the duty of care  Some of us listened to experts Most of us read the reports And all of us tried; none of us lied And besides, this is contracts, not torts.  On the board of too many adventures We just meet, maybe three times a year For the work day-to-day, there is simply no way We can do more than we have done here  Chorus: It's the duty of care It's the business judgment If you act in faith They can't pierce the veil Just because you're dumb And you lost a fortune You're not liable; it's the duty of care

      From our relatively new Dean of Students:   Occasionally, students will have a personal emergency during the exam period, if that happens, please call me at my office to discuss (XXX-XXX-XXXX).  If something happens during the night and you would rather not wait until the morning to discuss it, feel free to call me at home (XXX) XXX-XXXX or on my cell (XXX) XXX-XXXX.  Now the happy news... a Midnight Pancake Breakfast on Monday May 10.  We'll have pancakes, waffles etc in the [student center] from 11pm Monday to 1am Tuesday.  If you do this right, the sugar high might carry you to the end of exams... If I wanted to Parody this e-mail, it might look something like this:   Occasionally, students will have a personal emergency during the exam period -- for example, genital warts -- if that happens, please call me at my office to discuss (XXX-XXX-XXXX).  If something happens during the night and you would rather not wait until the morning to discuss it, feel free to call me at home (XXX) XXX-XXXX or on my cell (XXX) XXX-XXXX, or come visit (XXX X Street, XXX -- make a right on XXX after the XXX T-stop).  On Saturday from 10AM-4PM I will be at my sister's house.  You can give her a call (XXX-XXX-XXXX) or just drop by (XXX X Street, XXX, 3rd Floor).  We'll be having chicken.  Let me know if you're planning on stopping by, and we'll make up a plate for you.  Also, if you're a vegetarian, let me know -- vegetarian options are available.  I have a dental appointment on Tuesday at 8:45.  My dentist usually runs late, but feel free to call his assistant (XXX-XXX-XXXX, xXXX) to see if I'm still there, or just stop by (XXX, X Street, Suite XXX) and try to catch me before the novocaine.  I've been stopping at the Starbucks (www.starbucks.com) on Massachusetts Avenue before work every morning, so you can usually catch me there at 7:52 or so.  I'm the one ordering the tall skim latte.  Or you can try camping out in the faculty parking lot by my car (License Plate #XXXXXXX) to catch me on the way out, before I head home.  Now the happy news... I'm going to my brother-in-law's wedding on Thursday, and you're all invited.  Also, I'm hosting a  Midnight Sushi Breakfast on Monday, May 10.  We'll have unagi, wasabi etc in the [student center] from 6am to 8am Monday, to start your exam period off right.  Happy digesting! (But if it doesn't sit well with you, feel free to use my toilet -- I usually go around 1pm, but stop by (XXX X Street, XXX) and we'll get you in as soon as possible.  Good luck! Or maybe I'm just being needlessly harsh.  It's a nice e-mail.  She sounds very friendly.

      My mom just told me a funny story from work (she's an elementary school teacher). She was teaching vocabulary to a bunch of kindergarteners in the library, with the Librarian sitting there too, and the word she was teaching was "gigantic." "A tree can be gigantic, a house can be gigantic... can anyone think of anything else that's gigantic?" One of the kindergarteners raised his hand. "Mrs. [Librarian] is gigantic."   I've met Mrs. [Librarian]. And I think this kid belongs in the gifted program.

      My post from Saturday about the reader who wants to be a prosecutor: loan forgiveness programs.  Lots of schools have them, including this one.  They slipped my mind.  Thanks to Mark, Lana, Michael, Dave, Ferdinand, and Ophelia for reminding me.  Ferdinand and Ophelia are made up.  I thought there were more and then realized as I scrolled up that there were only 4.  So I thought I'd add two.  But it's hard to come up with fake convincing names.  Ferdinand and Ophelia sound like they would make a nice couple though.  If any of my professors are reading, you can make my day by having Ferdinand and Ophelia either share stock tips, gift appreciated property, or fight over the V-chip on my final exams next week.  Although I bet the exams are already written.  So probably no Ferdinand and Ophelia.  Maybe next year.

      Look at  urlLink The Cranky Critic 's review of the new Ben Stiller / Jack Black movie "Envy."  Now look at the  urlLink Rotten Tomatoes  page for it, which shows that TWO of 69 reviews for the movie are positive.  The Cranky Critic, of all movie reviewers I've seen, the one I most consitstently either agree with or at least understand where he's coming from and can figure out from the review that even though he liked it/didn't like it, I'd probably not like it/like it.  But he's in SUCH the minority on this one... so the question becomes: see the movie, or don't see the movie?  (If I do want to see it, the next question is easier -- "not until finals are over")  I also want to see  urlLink "Mean Girls" , written by SNL's Tina Fey, and, even though it's a movie being marketed for teen girls, it still looks funny and interesting.  I guess I don't know if I want to see this badly enough that I'll seek it out and won't just wait until it's out on DVD, but maybe.  Anyone who sees it (or Envy) and wants to tell me if it's worth it, I'm happy to hear.

       Book Review: "The Progress Paradox" by Gregg Easterbrook   The subtitle of "The Progress Paradox" does a great job summing up what the book is about: "How Life Gets Better While People Feel Worse."  Basically, the book's about how life for people in the Western World has never been better -- people are healthier and live longer than ever before, have more leisure time, an abundance of food and consumer goods, luxuries people a few generations ago could never have dreamed of -- yet we're not any happier.  The book is littered with conversation-droppers, little facts that percolate in your head and end up finding an appropriate place in all sorts of discussions -- two that I've found myself using just in the day or so since I finished the book: (1) people complain about having to spend money on health care, but what better thing could we be spending money on than living longer, healthier lives -- Easterbrook argues we should be glad that we can spend such a substantial fraction of our income on something as important and rewarding as health care; (2) society as a whole is well-off enough that even people at the lower end of the income scale live lives that are much closer to how the rich live than ever before in history -- they have cars, and cable TV, and a place to live, and enough food -- the differences are much more marginal than in the past -- life expectancy for the poor is not substantially lower than for the rich -- heck, one of the biggest problems is that poor people are overweight.  Poor people in generations past simply could not afford enough food that they could ever be overweight.  Crime is down, jobs are less labor-intensive than in generations past, people have more leisure time, education is more obtainable, etc, etc, etc.  The vast majority of people live in something approaching The American Dream.  But trend-lines say we're no happier than we used to be.  And that beyond an income of $11,000/year, more money really doesn't seem to buy more happiness. Depression rates are rising.  Self-reported happiness surveys report happiness down.  Easterbrook spends a while arguing that part of it is that people don't feel like the next generation will be any better -- that we already have so much how can quality of life continue to rise.  That argument doesn't ring true to me as much as his other big one, that for most of humanity we've had to worry about necessities like food and shelter, and now that most of our necessities are taken care of, we worry about wants -- and there are always more things to want, and more things that other people have, that we can never get fully satisfied.  And the wants disappoint when we get them, so we're never really happy.  His third (related) argument is that for the first time people aren't worried about the necessities and now have time to ponder the meaning of life and worry about fulfillment -- and that's harder to satisfy than food on the table will satisfy hunger.    This was all very interesting to read, because it's the kind of stuff I sometimes ponder and he's pondered it in a more organized and better-researched way than I ever have, obviously, so I found this compelling.  But then the last half of the book seems to lose its nerve and its ambition.  Easterbrook argues we should all sleep more, be more forgiving, and keep a "gratitude journal," and that as a society if we raised prices a little bit we could pretty much eradicate the problem of world impoverishment and that we have a duty to give more aid to poor countries.  I don't disagree with any of that, but it's not as bold and insightful as the first half of the book got me revved up for.  I sleep a lot, and I'm pretty grateful, I think -- but I still wrestle with questions about how to really feel like I'm living a life that matters and wake up each morning content and happy and fulfilled.  The book didn't get me any closer.  It didn't help explain why it seems like so many people don't admit these concerns and go on living lives that seem shallow and unrewarding.  It pretended we all care about this stuff, and I'm not sure we all do.  And the foreign aid stuff is great -- but it's not prescriptive toward individual lives so much -- I could give $30 a month to Save The Children, but beyond that there isn't a ton I can do to effect governmental policy (although I guess if everyone read his book and lobbied for higher sales taxes...).  CEOs get paid too much, sure.  We don't need three TVs per person, sure.  But this wasn't what the book built up in its excellent first half to leave me hoping for in the less-excellent second half.  I can't recommend the first 187 pages of this book any more than I do.  Read them.  They're fascinating, thought-provoking, and really excellent.  But the next 150 didn't do it for me.  I don't know.  I don't know what I was waiting for, but it didn't hit me hard enough.  I can't help but think there's a different second half of this book on Gregg Easterbrook's hard drive, and his editors wanted a different story.  But read the book.  It's mostly quite fantastic.

      Okay, here we go, the ultimate exam studying post.  I'm taking it as a challenge that  urlLink Evan  didn't link to me this week, even though I'm sure it's nothing personal.  By putting the word "ultimate" into the first line, I'm setting myself up for disappointment, I know, but I'm going to try to somehow balance humor and actual information into this post, in a way no one has ever done before...   The Ultimate Exam Studying Post: Ten Steps to Exam Success   1. Isolate your materials.  This is my favorite step of the exam studying process, because it requires very little mental engagement but somehow feels like an accomplishment.  I print out everything I want to look at for each exam.  I search the Internet for useful outlines (I like the ones with tables and charts), I search the Harvard database for useful outlines actually relevant to my professors, I print out my notes, I print out practice exams, I slot in the paper notes from the day I didn't bring my laptop, so that everything's together.  I take the silly unnecessary handouts out of the folds of casebook and either put them in order (if they're useful), or put them on a shelf (if they're not).  I buy a new highlighter and some legal pads.  I make a list of everything I have.  I vacuum, so the books and papers don't get dusty.  I say a blessing over the outlines.  And then I am ready.  And can move on to step 2.  2. Read.  Step two is my second favorite step of the exam studying process, because it's not that hard, and really does feel like an accomplishment, because it is one.  I read everything.  I read the outlines, I read my notes, I skim the casebooks -- all to make sure I'm not missing any big chunks of material in my head, and everything has a chance to float around and make connections in my subconscious.  So that even if I don't remember what rule 16(b) is, I remember it's important, and I vaguely remember where I can find out more, and that it's something I might be tested on.  As I read, I let things percolate in my head and hope they come together.  The occasional insight -- like "oh, so if we don't tax that thing over here, we must therefore tax it... yes?... yes?... over there?... yes!" -- makes this step feel relatively painless.  3. Summarize.  Step three is my least favorite step because it requires a chunk of time and a good deal of typing.  And, as this blog poorly demonstrates, I hate to type stuff.  I like making really short outlines with everything I need to know, said in as few words as possible.  So I go back through all of my outlines and notes, and make sure everything gets represented in some way, but if it's 5 pages long it's probably too long.  I won't actually use this outline for much.  But I like knowing it's there.   4. Practice tests.  I always mean to do more practice tests than I do.  I try to sit down and really write down answers, but I'm just not committed.  I'm always thinking, "oh, in the test I'll know this but for now let me just skip it because it's no fun."  This is (in my opinion the only thing) what study groups are good for.  Grab a friend and force him to take the practice test with you, and then you can compare answers and see who knows less about the class.  It's fun.  You can both feel stupid, it's a blast.  More than 3 people I've found turns into a useless exercise in trying to stay focused, which makes it less valuable when actually motivated to study, but more fun if you want to talk trash about your classmates ("did you hear she got a job cleaning up trash on the side of the road for the summer?"  "No?  Oh, I meant she got a job at a medium-to-large-sized law firm in a major city. My bad.")  5. Memorize the tax code.    6. Step five is a lie, but I'm running out of steps.  Why, oh why, did I promise TEN steps?  I don't have TEN steps!  I have about four and a half, and all the rest of this is going to be filler!  7. Read the instructions on the practice exam and commit them to memory.  This is something I've heard people say.  What a dumb idea.  What if the professor changes the instructions?  And like you can't spare 90 seconds at the beginning of the exam to remind yourself what to do?  8. Get sleep.  Obviously.  9. Don't take an antihistamine before the exam.  Tax (yawn) law (yawn) is (yawn) (snore).  10. Get an A.  Well, that's the best advice of all.  Man, this post degenerated into worthlessness pretty quickly.  Sorry about that.  I thought I had more to say!  Guess not.

      Someone waived Chipper Jones in one of my fantasy leagues, just because he's on the DL for a couple of weeks.  I had the lowest waiver priority so I picked him up.  Not that anyone cares, but I just spent the first 36 minutes of my day adjusting the fantasy baseball lineups for my 6 teams today.  Dropping a couple of players, picking up a couple of players, proposing a trade, figuring out if Juan Rincon's 4 vulture wins as a reliever are a harbinger of more to come or just a fluke (I'm guessing just a fluke, but it's obviously just a guess).  It's funny how everything takes longer when there's a tax outline on your desk.

      A reader writes: "I am considering going to law school, and would very much like to become a prosecutor or work in a non-profit of some sort, yet the cost of law school relative to the average public sector salary is a bit daunting. I have some reservations as to representing corporations and devoting all of my free time toward meeting billing requirements, so I would rather not work in a firm. Do you have any words of advice in this matter?"  I wrote back with some advice, but wasn't sure I was all that helpful, and feel like maybe I was missing the point of the question, or at least there's some nuance that I'm just not grabbing.  But, anyway, my answer: "Sounds like it comes down to math, and your willingness to live in debt.  No one will force you to take a firm job, but I imagine it will be hard to resist if you're going to have lots of student loans to pay off.  The good thing about student loans is that there is no such thing as debtor's prison, so if being a prosecutor or working in a non-profit is your life dream, and you're sure of it, then I don't see a good reason not to go to law school. I'm not sure what other advice I can give...."  I'm not sure why I'm posting this, since I don't know that my advice qualifies as particularly insightful.  But maybe someone wants to run with it and pass along something better for me to pass along to the person who asked the question.

      Lazy advertisement I saw on the subway -- it was from an abortion rights group and had a picture of an imaginary "Abortion Outlawed" headline on a newspaper article.  The words in this fake article were big enough to read, but whoever made the ad didn't bother to write a mock article, and instead just used what looked like an article about foreign tax credits, probably from something like the Wall Street Journal -- but it was completely unrelated and served no purpose.  How hard would it have been, before printing your ad for the subway, to either (a) blur out the words, or, even better, (b) write a fake article.  Inexcusably lazy.  More randomness: I just posted at  urlLink Crescat  a link to  urlLink this article  from Thursday's Harvard Crimson about a report asking for gender-neutral bathrooms to accommodate transgendered students who don't feel comfortable in the men's room or the women's room.  I commented that I'm sure my initial reaction that it seems kind of silly would be different if I knew any transgendered people and could see this through their eyes.  Nevertheless, the article was interesting, and maybe someone else wants to be bold enough to write something substantive about it in either direction, so there's the link.

      Whenever we have a summer associate event in the evenings, people who live outside of Manhattan can get a car back.  I'm living in way-far-from-Manhattan-and-an-hour-commute-each-way Brooklyn with my parents, and so I qualify for that.  So I was talking to my mom on my cell phone while in the car, and I mentioned something about a bunch of other summer associates mentioning to me tonight that they had seen my weblog, and after I hung up, the car driver starts a conversation with me.  I swear all of this is real.  I swear.  "You a summer associate?" "Yeah." "Good thing you don't work for [firm].  They find out someone has something like a weblog, they fire you instantly.  Not tomorrow, not next week, today." "Oh." "But the firm you should really go work for is [other firm].  Nicest people in New York.  We drive for all of the firms.  [Your firm] is fine, but [other firm] is the best.  Everyone is very polite, very nice to each other, and don't just get in the car and start yelling at people over their phones.  You should work for [other firm].  Very liberal.  Very nice people." "Oh." "What kind of law you want to do?" "[kind of law]" "Oh.  Yes.  [Other firm] is great at that.  Do you know [partner at other firm who by coincidence happened to be one of the people at that firm who interviewed me]?" "Yeah.  Big guy, right?" "Yes.  And one of the best lawyers in New York.  You want to do [kind of law], [other firm] is where you should be.  [This partner]'s wife, a very old woman, is so bossy.  They were late to a hockey game, and she goes on and on and on.  But he is a very nice man.  [Other firm] is really a great firm.  Very good." "Oh."  He should be a recruiter for [other firm].  Really.

      (Thanks to Adam for inspiring this post) "In my fantasy world, it's time for the next round of summer associate eliminations in the real-life reality game show that is Summer Associate Survivor.  In this world, there are many summer associates, but only a few get offers.  Already, some summer associates have been eliminated due to their performance in one of a number of competitions: (1) the due diligence relay, where one team of four failed to find the  urlLink extra bracket on page 40  and were eliminated; (2) the document review-a-thon, where our eliminated friend forgot to redact the name of the library book our client's CEO returned three days late; (3) the five-mile-lunch, where three summers vomited after eating $50 meals at eight restaurants, one right after the other, and thus were eliminated; (4) the sleep-is-for-the-weary challenge, where during hour 64 of the stay-awake-during-the-world's-longest-conference-call, one thus-eliminated summer fell asleep; and (5) the picture database memorization exercise, where five summers were unable to commit the names and faces of every firm partner to memory within two hours of arriving, and were thus eliminated as well.  So that got rid of 14.  Now it's time to get rid of one more.  You have three choices.  The choice is yours.  (A) Larry Loveslaw, Hometown: Nashville, TN.  In his slow southern drawl, Larry Loveslaw can talk about nothing but the 1940 Securities Act, as well as its implications on his ever-growing portfolio of personal investments.  There's no denying that Larry is intelligent (and he'd be the first to agree with that), but where Larry really shines is in his willingness to think about nothing except for the task at hand.  Last movie seen: The Paper Chase, during 1L orientation; Favorite TV show: Does not own a TV; Favorite food: cardboard; Leisure time activity: recreating landmark Supreme Court oral arguments using transcripts available on the Web, and his Supreme Court Paper Doll set, handcrafted by Larry's mom.  (B) Henrietta Husbandseeker, Hometown: Boston, MA.  No one knows yet, but Henrietta's pregnant.  With twins.  Her one mission this summer is to find a husband, whether he's a partner, an associate, or a fellow summer.  Heck, she's even thinking about asking the pretzel man on a date.  She'll make a capable attorney, but that's not the life she wants.  She wants a lawyer's salary, without all the effort.  She wants three houses.  And fourteen kids.  Last movie seen: The Stepford Wives; Favorite TV show: Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire? Favorite food: not sushi -- she's pregnant!; Leisure time activity: shopping.  (C) Walter Goofinoff, Hometown: Leningrad?  Walter's here to have a good time.  Not that he's not doing his work.  He does his work.  But he's here to have a good time.  He goes on lunches every day, he smuggles Vodka into the office (he's from Russia, after all), he occasionally steals money out of other people's wallets.  But he's well-intentioned, and he does do his work.  Reasonably well.  Last movie seen: Jackass: The Movie; Favorite TV show: Punk'd; Favorite food: Vodka; Leisure time activity: Raping and pillaging."

      Tonight we have a "progressive dinner" in Little Italy.  We're visiting three restaurants, each for a different part of the meal.  I imagined perhaps it would be more than three, and we'd eat very very little at very very many places.  That it might look like this (all restaurant names are made up; note that I clearly don't speak Italian):  1. Wash hands in restroom at La Prosciuttorie 2. Sit down, and immediately stand up again at Luigi & Mario's 3. Hunk of bread at Famous Original Ray's Pizza, Location 44 4. Pat of butter at Pasta e Pasta Sauce 5. Three baby lettuce leaves at Salami Hut 6. 2 walnuts at Antonio's House of Marinara 7. Shot glass of raspberry vinagrette at Las Miserables Food 8. One chicken nugget covered in sauce and cheese at Maria's Italian Bistro & Falafel Stand ...  You get the point.

      Fumbling with chopsticks at lunch today, I began to wonder: at foreign restaurants in Asian countries, do they give out forks and knives?  And do the patrons, used to their chopsticks, have trouble using them?  Is there a learning curve for a knife and fork, like chopsticks?  Do the particularly ill-adept ask for chopsticks to eat their steak with because they can't handle a knife and fork?  Do they look at Western food and get flustered?  Or is it all pretty easy?

You're planning on watching 0.8 hours of TV tonight followed by 1.2 hours of pleasurable reading 9. You refer to an orgy as a three-prong test (maybe not) 8. You tell your parents they can no longer tell you what to do because you're in a different jurisdiction 7. You borrow your neighbor's lawnmower with an securitized loan 6. "I'll take 4 tickets to the Yankees game, on contingency.  They win, I'll pay." 5. Your son's allowance dispute arbitration is scheduled for next Thursday at 9 4. You perform due diligence on your restaurant takeout menus to get rid of the duplicates 3. For others it's shoplifting, for you it's a hostile takeover 2. Your trash talk repertoire includes the line, "You are my wholly-owned subsidiary" 1. "I love you, subject to the terms and conditions in schedule A"

       urlLink Christopher Hitchens  has a piece on Slate critiquing Farenheit 9/11.  It's worth a read.  Hidden in Slate's underbelly is Hitchens' first draft of a similar critique of "White Chicks."  Here's an excerpt:  "To describe this film as dishonest and demagogic would almost be to promote those terms to the level of respectability.  White Chicks is a sinister exercise in the distortion of reality, unfairly disguised as a light comedy.  It is a call to race-based rioting masking itself as a frivolous exercise in frivolity.  White Chicks makes the following points about caucasian females growing up saddled, through no fault of their own, with wealth beyond reasonable means, and makes them in this order:  1) Caucasian females enjoy terrible pop songs sung by other caucasian females.  2) Many caucasian females enjoy trading witty repartee with other caucasian females.  3) Caucasian females frequent country clubs filled exclusively with other caucasians.  4) Fashion shows are silly and deserve to be mocked (this, of course, ignores the valuable good that fashion shows at country clubs have provided to the country over the years in terms of scientific breakthroughs and accomplishments in great literature).  5) Caucasian females have difficulty dancing, due to innate characteristics of Caucasians, which also enable them to process lactose in a way that at least one of the Wayans Brothers cannot.  6) The American lives lost in Afghanistan have been wasted.  Disregarding the errant sixth point, it must be evident to anyone, despite the rapid-fire way in which Wayans's direction eases the audience hastily past the contradictions, that these discrepant scatter shots do not cohere into one compelling story. Either caucasian females are non-dancing, non-lactose-intolerating, bad-pop-song-enjoying figures to be deeply mocked, or they are innocent victims' of their parents' massive wealth, and undeserving of the broadside hits taken at them by this disgraceful film.  The Wayans Brothers simply cannot have it both ways."

       A Long Entry About Nothing   Due to the vagaries of the New York City subway system, (1) I arrived at work 8 minutes earlier than usual, and (2) for the first time in many weeks, I got a seat.  I arrived at work to discover (1) our elevator news and information screens have apparently (according to a banner ad that appeared) been acquired by Gannett, makers of USA Today, which makes sense, since where else can you find descriptive elevator headlines like "Number of People Die In Tragic Accident" than in USA Today, and (2) there is apparently a "broken stair" in the stairwell.  Whenever I'm early / bored / hungry in the morning, I make a stop at the "Attorney Lounge" before heading to my office (although it really shouldn't be called a "Lounge" so much as perhaps a "Break Room" or a "Semi-Daily Free Food and Beverage Facility."  "Lounge" implies that a certain genre of entertainer would feel at home there.  That would not hold true in the Attorney Lounge.  Wayne Newton singing the best of Barry Manilow(or vice versa) would be decidedly out of place there.  In any event, I make a stop there for a muffin (or a bagel) in the morning sometimes, if I'm early enough to feel like there might still be some left.  And then I take the stairs the two floors up to my office.  But today there was a sign in the stairwell, "Broken Stair.  Use the elevator."  But it was unclear whether, by the time I reached the sign, if I'd somehow passed the broken stair already, or it was upcoming.  And there was no evidence of a broken stair.  So, all the while feeling like there was real potential for me to feel awfully silly ("You fell through the floor?  But you saw the sign, right?  Are you a moron?"), I carefully continued my stair journey -- with a hot cup of tea in my hand, mind you -- trying to take extra caution in case of the mysterious broken stair.  Demonstrating (once again) that my life is not a sitcom, I did not encounter any obviously broken stair, and arrived safely at my office without incident.   In other news:  this morning on the subway I completed the Paul Collins trilogy.  Avid readers may recall that a couple of weeks ago I mentioned I'd read Collins' "Not Even Wrong" a wonderfully-written book about the author's son diagnosed with autism, and a history of autism of sorts throughout the ages, but, even more significantly, just a really well-written, engaging, compelling book.  So I bought Collins' other two books, "Banvard's Folly," about 13 men who tried to change the world and failed (ex: a guy who invented Concord Grapes; a Shakespeare forger who was a solid playwright in his own right; a guy who thought blue light could cure lots of bad diseases), and "Sixpence House," about the author's trip to a small town in England that is home to lots of antique booksellers, and basically a story about old books.  They're both quite worth reading.  Excellent stuff.  I enjoyed the most recent one, "Not Even Wrong" probably the most of the three, but they're all quite good.  I have an urge, whenever I really enjoy something, be it book, music, or film, to see/hear/read the entire corpus of work by the creator.  I feel like I may be missing a gem if I don't.  Hence a somewhat bizarre set of CDs/mp3s, indicating a slight fetish for the albums that good songwriters release in their declining years.  Next up on the reading list: Fierce Pajamas, a collection of humor pieces from The New Yorker.  I'll let you know.

       An Acrostic Poem About Being A Summer Associate   A is for associates.  They're what summer associates become, like a caterpillar becomes a butterfly.  But what if I'd rather stay a caterpillar?  What if flying doesn't seem all that exciting?  What if flying means you need to pay for your own lunch? B is for billing tiny increments of every hour: "wrote an acrostic poem about life as a summer associate / non-billable / 0.4 hours." C is for copy codes, client codes, and codes of all sorts.  Codes for billable time, non-billable time, time spent on "summer associate learning," "professional reading," and "non-billable office maintenance." D is for due diligence, which means reading through papers looking for stuff.  I'm not sure what stuff.  Maybe that's my problem. E is for the emergency kit they gave us on the first day, with a glow-stick, water, energy bars, a heat blanket, a gas mask, and a poncho, but not an emergency Lexis account number, despite those emergencies perhaps being more critical to law firm survival. F is for the free lunches.  "Dessert?  Do I really want dessert?  Well, if it's free, then I suppose I'd better get dessert.  After all, dessert is the best part of every meal.  And even better when it's free.  Although it's not really free.  It's just free to me.  But I'm sure I'll have to pay for it someday." G is for the garbage pail that gets emptied every day, sometimes twice a day, even if all I throw out are a couple of pieces of paper and a small piece of my soul (I'm kidding about the soul part). H is for the haricot verts.  I don't know what they are, but they're on lots of menus.  I think it's a vegetable.  I bet it sounds better in whatever language it's in than it does in English. I is for the impossible amount of paper in everyone's office.  So much paper.  So little time. J is for the other Jews.  Did you know lots of lawyers are Jewish?  And that not too many relevant words begin with "J" ?   K is for the Konference Kalls.  Yes, I'm cheating.  But after K I only have two letters left to do (I'm doing this out of order, as they come to me), and I just want to get finished and post this already.  Bonus points to anyone who wants to guess which 2 letters were my last ones, the ones left after K.  Hint: I did the intuitively-hardest ones first. L is for legal research, which, despite what you might think, is often a bit dry. M is for the  urlLink masturbating judge  you can read about on The Smoking Gun.  Bizarre story of a judge who did some bad stuff on the bench.  (Thanks to  urlLink Evan  for linking to him.) N is for the noose.  See R. O is for the oatmeal-scented soap in the bathroom.  I like the oatmeal-scented soap.  It's soothing.  P is for partners.  Partners are scary. Q is for quiet, when you can hear the hum of the computer, the distant sounds of the printer, the ringing of the phones, the beeping of the elevator, and the screaming from down the hall. R is for the rope.  See N. S is for having a secretary, despite not really having any need for one, and feeling kind of awkward whenever I ask her something, like what to do with the pile of inter-office mail envelopes I've collected on my desk.  "I'll take care of them," she said.  "Thanks." T is for the train I take to work.  T is for the terrible-smelling people and the tightly-packed car and the too-frequent announcements of track delays. U is for UNICEF.  They do good work.  Look, it was either that or underwear, and I really didn't want to go there, especially not after M. V is for the view out the window.  It's a nice view. W is for weekends, which summer associates don't have to work, but it seems as if associates sometimes do, which sounds less than wonderful.  Wonderful also begins with W.  So does Westlaw.  I'm a Lexis guy myself, although the fact that I have a preference between the two is sad.  Woefully sad.  Woefully also begins with W. X is for the xtra-large paychecks.  Even though they're not actually larger-than-life in a Publishers Clearing House sense, they kind of feel like they should be. Y is for the Z is for the zipper on my suit pants and how I hope it never breaks, because that would really not be good, and I'd have to buy a new suit I guess, or bring this one to a suit-fixer, or whoever fixes zippers, and I don't want that.

      I saw "Fahrenheit 9/11" today.  It's standard Michael Moore.  Very well done, but obviously it's politically charged toward the left, and so because the bias is so obvious, it loses some of its bite.  It definitely leaves you thinking about the war and the gravitas (or lack thereof) of the current administration, but it also leaves you wondering which parts are really genuinely actual and which parts are easily rebutted and just carefully constructed sleight of hand.  I don't want to spoil it for anyone, so I won't really delve into content -- but the truth is that even if I was to delve into content, I don't have that much to say.  Michael Moore knows a lot more than I do about the war.  All I know is what felt honest and what felt contrived.  But it's a solidly entertaining and interesting sit-through.  I can't help but recommend it.  Regardless of your politics.  But I also don't think it's going to change anyone's mind.  It'll just reinforce whatever feelings you've got.

      Last night, the whole firm had an event -- summer associates, associates, support staff, their families, everyone.  It was very nice, lots of food, lots of stuff for people's kids to do.  One of the things they had was a fortune teller.  Now, maybe it's just me, but I can't imagine the fortune teller job at a law firm event is all that difficult.  I mean, I could do this job, and I have no special fortune-telling gifts:  >"You will stay late at the office tomorrow." >"You will work at some point this weekend, or some weekend in the near future." >"You will check your Blackberry sometime within the next five minutes." >"You will use one or more legal research services in the near future." >"You will purchase some new business casual attire." >"Your vacation will be in danger of being cancelled, but providence will be on your side and it will take place as planned, despite the nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you ought to be at work." >"Your clients will settle soon." >"Your salary will soon rise in a stepladder increment."

      I saw the movie "White Chicks."  I give it 4/10.  It is a collection of jokes that don't really form a satisfying movie, but it's not dreadful to sit through.  There's really no reason to bother, but you won't hate yourself if you have to see it.  I only saw it because we wanted to see Farenheit 9/11 but it was sold out.  White Chicks wasn't sold out.  Look, it's better than the disaster it looked like it was going to be.  But it's not like it's a good movie.

      Someone found this site by searching on Google for "Ryan Seacrest internships."  Sorry.  None here.  And not sure really what you want to do for Ryan Seacrest.  Style his hair?  I wrote the other day before our trip to the Culinary Institute as a summer associate event, but didn't say anything about it afterwards, mostly because the food wasn't that good, and I didn't really think about it.  But I've had a request for more about it, so I'll see what I can do.  Notes on the culinary institute:  (1) They gave out paper chef's hats.  On the way out, I noticed they sell the hats.  These hats should maybe sell for $2.  Maybe.  They sell them for $15.  Crazy people, these culinary institute people.  (2) So they served us some appetizers, and then ushered us into some rooms where we were split up to prepare dinner.  I ended up having to squirt pesto from a tube into a hole they made inside raw chicken breasts.  This is as foul (I mean fowl) as it sounds.  Other people got to put strawberries in a blender.  How I ended up with my job is just the luck of the draw.  (3) The meal took a long, long time and wasn't particularly good.  The event was ok fun, not great fun, but ok fun.  I wouldn't hire someone from the culinary institute if I was opening a restaurant though.  Sorry.

      Thank you,  urlLink Waddling Thunder  for writing a post that could inspire a comment that could inspire me to respond in a rambling, long-winded, and generally pointless manner.  This doesn't happen often enough, so I figure I'd better seize on it.  WT's anonymous commenter wrote, in response to a post about getting grades today:   the competitiveness is the worst thing about harvard - i wasn't like this before, either. the school brings it out in everyone and then makes you feel relatively stupid in comparison to people around you because you're surrounded by so many brilliant people. so you resent yourself *and* your classmates. i think this is why, in the end, harvard has such a tight, cliquey alum community. because we've all been through this ego-crushing crapfest and made it out alive. And here's where I started typing something about how whoever's feeling this way is making themselves feel this way, because you can make the opposite argument.  It's not competitive at all.  Everyone who wants a job gets a job -- a good job, in fact, if that's the job you want.  Everyone who doesn't want a job still gets one because it's almost impossible to avoid getting one.  Everyone at any selective law school has proven themselves competent already, probably many times over, in high school and in college and perhaps in the working world.  I honestly can't see how someone can really take his low grade in Torts as a statement of some greater import than "these other people gave a better answer on the Torts exam than I did," and why that statement isn't perfectly reasonable.  And maybe that just means that I'm less invested in this whole law school thing, and I should feel more competitive, and it's a failing on my part.  Being in the pack at a selective law school should not be some ego-crushing thing.  But, you know what, I only live in my own head.  I understand people can feel this way.  The only thing I really feel like I can legitimately respond to is the word "everyone."  It's not everyone.  And I'm as cynical as anyone but it's not fair to people thinking about going to law school to have to imagine that everyone feels this way and that's the world you live in as a law student.  That sounds like a terrible world to live in.  And it's just not the case that everyone feels like that -- I know lots of people who don't.  I mean, of course there are probably going to be people who can answer the exam questions better than you can, and, yeah, in a way that maybe kind of sucks if you thought you would be better at law school than everyone else.  But I don't think it means there's something wrong with you, or that you need to hate the people who do better on exams, or that any part of this has to be in any way emotionally impactful.  Life is not the National Spelling Bee.  There's more than one winner.  You're at one of these places?  You're doing fine.  Bottom of the class, you've still got tons of doors open to you.  You don't have to be miserable because other people know more rules of evidence than you do.  End of rant.  Consider this all tongue-in-cheek if it turns out I've said anything too stupid.

      Three more assorted notes on the day:  1. I was in an associate's office for something, and he noticed on the Internet that some South Korean guy was killed.  Referring to the big important news stories I don't read, despite the fact I go to the NY Times website pretty much every day.  But I read the Arts and Leisure stories, the interesting science news, stuff about political campaigns, sports, domestic stuff... I just can't get into the international stuff, even big stuff, like this war we're in (we're still at war, right?).  Just doesn't click for me.  So I'm woefully ignorant.  Oh well.  2. Tonight we have a summer associate event at the Culinary Institute where we're going to (apparently) make some food and then eat it.  Which begs the only logical question: if we have a night at the culinary institute, does that mean that interns at the culinary institute have a night where they visit a law firm and learn how to do law stuff?  It would only make sense....  3. The first chapter of Bill Clinton's book is on the NY Times site.  I'm not compelled to read the rest.  Sorry.  Only to parody it.

      A whole bunch of little things I feel like writing about this morning:  1. Just in case you thought people were exaggerating when they talked about NY housing prices.  Posted on a bulletin board here: "Quiet, sunny studio apartment for sale: Co-op located [in good neighborhood].  Approx 440 sq ft.  Elevator bldg.  Laundry in basement.  Window in kitchen.  Asking  $215,000.  Monthly maintenance is $622.51."  Note the square footage.  Note that the "monthly maintenance" sounds a lot like "rent," but you also have to pay a gazillion dollars just for the privilege of living there and getting to pay this rent every month.  Gosh.  2. Trying to make lunch plans with associates is kind of like (and I'm stretching for the analogy here) asking a girl out on a date.  Don't want to look too desperate, seem too forward, put yourself too far out there for fear of rejection.  "If you're not too busy...;" "I totally understand if you can't...;" "I know the odds are you're not available, but...;" "If you aren't doing anything and have been hoping someone would ask you...;" "Not to put any pressure at all on you...."  Yes, I'm trying too hard.  3. I read "Wonderland," by Michael Bamberger on my commute yesterday.  It's the story of a year in a typical American high school, and some of the students he met, and their stories.  Human interest stuff.  Very well-written -- he's a writer for Sports Illustrated, so he knows what he's doing as far as human interest people pieces -- and really engaging.  Not anything extraordinary, but a totally satisfying subway read.

      Got my grades.  They look a lot like my other grades.  Pretty much what I expected.  Despite my grades pretty consistently matching my expectations I still get kind of nervous/excited when I see them for the first time.  And then I see them, and they look like I expect them to, and I realize it didn't really make sense to care that much about them, since they're pretty much what I thought they would be.  Whatever.  No disasters, no surprises.

      Went to a Thai restaurant for lunch today.  Lunch specials, most of which were $7.95.  Line at the bottom of the menu: "Lunch minimum: $8.00 per person."  But your lunch specials cost $7.95?!  Silly menu writers.  (I didn't actually notice the line on the menu, so I don't mean to take personal credit for the observation.  I'm just reporting.)

      Thought I'd smoked out the system -- we got an e-mail on Friday saying our grades would be posted online on Tuesday the 22nd.  This is about 3 weeks earlier than last year, which is either a testament that the new online grading system saves heaps of time, or just means people weren't so darn slow this year grading exams.  But I had a hunch that if they were saying they'd be up tomorrow -- they didn't give a time -- they really meant today.  So I checked.  They're not up yet.  Oh well.  I can wait.  I can wait a while.  I know they don't matter.  But I'd be lying if I denied being curious anyway.

      Perhaps this is how to do it.  On Wednesday,  urlLink Volokh  posted the following:   Pledge break: Some blogs ask their readers for money to help operate the blog. That's quite understandable, but we fortunately don't need that....  We're in it for the eyeballs. (Yumm, eyeballs.) So if you like the blog, just let your friends know about it -- perhaps take a blog post you really like, pass it along (together with its URL) to people who you think would enjoy it, and tell them that there's a lot more where that came from. Or not: We're happy with just your eyeballs, too. And Volokh's hits jumped from about 12,000 Tuesday to about 16,000 Wednesday.  (Yes, that's a lot of readers.)  Maybe there were other reasons (someone popular linked?).  But interesting.    I'm not very subtle, am I?  :)

      The assignment for tomorrow's session of the mostly-worthless-but-at-least-it-gets-me-writing-although-I-kind-of-write-anyway sketch-writing workshop I'm doing on Monday nights is two-fold: (1) the most vulgar sketch you can write, and (2) a couple of blackout sketches.  I haven't tackled (1) yet.  I think it's a pretty useless assignment.  I'm figuring I'll knock something out at work tomorrow.  For (2), some brief explanation: a blackout is a very short scene that ends on a twist.  Like the commercial where people are making out in the backseat of a car and then it's revealed it's not kids but actually their parents.  Ooh.  Blackout.  It's called a blackout because you reveal the punchline and then, bam, the lights go down.  They're often pun-related, or just one joke that doesn't have anywhere to go, or just something corny or silly or stupid.  Here's two.  They're not thrilling.  I'm not that inspired.  I may try to come up with some better ones tomorrow at work.  1. 2 Guys at a restaurant table.  Very attractive foreign woman is taking their order in broken English... "Yes, ze Shish Kebab, very good...."  She starts to walk away.  Guy 1: "She's hot."  Guy 2: "Yeah, and I know the one word to say to get her to come running."  Guy 1: "Yeah, what's that?"  Guy 2: "Deportation."  Blackout.  2. I think I posted a variation of this in prose the other day.  Commercial parody.  "For all the carbs you'll get in this one piece of bread, you can have fourteen plates of fatty bacon."  Man walks by.  "I choose the bacon."  And grabs the fourteen plates.  Blackout.  See, not that thrilling.  My posts yesterday were better.

       An Open Letter from a Summer Associate to a Law Firm Partner, Part II   Dear Law Firm Partner,  Thank you for indulging my irrational fear of the letter Q by not staffing me on the Qualcomm case, letting me miss our trip to see the Tony Award-winning Broadway musical "Avenue Q," and not telling me to be Quiet when I accidentally screamed obscenities at your secretary while in your office listening in on the conference call.  While it was not my fault that she put two sugars in my coffee when I clearly asked for one, I should have found a better way to deal with it than by calling her a cow.  It was my mistake, and I assure you it will not happen an excessively large number of times in the future.   Thank you for telling me I didn't have to wear a suit to court, even though you were obviously kidding and I knew that and decided to pretend you were serious anyway, because I really didn't want to wear a suit.  I know it was awkward for us to meet down at the courthouse, you in your suit and me in a gorilla costume, but I'm sure the judge understood.  I was only trying to be amusing.  How was I supposed to know that our client's wife was eaten by a gorilla?  Or that the court reporter was a very hairy man who would think I was his long-lost brother?  It was all an unfortunate misunderstanding, and I completely agreed with you when you suggested afterwards that I might want to avoid going to court anymore this summer.  Thank you for not telling anyone I have genital warts.  It was probably an inappropriate thing to share with you during the client meeting, but it seemed relevant at the time.  It was only afterwards when I realized the client had said he liked "sports," not "warts."  My mistake.  Also, once again, thank you for paying me.  Your friend, Summer Associate

      I find it hard to believe I've been a summer associate for five weeks already.  That's 24 work days (we were off for Memorial Day).  Approximately 192 hours in the office.  Except for the 80 or so of those when I've been at lunch.  Possibly as many as 3 or 4 hours of work they can bill to clients.  :)  No, I'm kidding. It's been a nice balance of work, lunch, and waiting for each of them.  I really, honestly, absolutely have a much better sense of what lawyers do at places like these than I did before.  Which should be obvious.  But still, it's definitely given me a much more real picture, beyond just the stories people tell.  And I've gotten a nice variety of assignments -- I've done research, written some memos, learned how to use some online databases, watched stuff happen in court, sat in on conference calls, been to meetings where partners talk about stuff, and watched someone sign a will.  Other people have done other things -- drafted contract language or sections of briefs, I'm sure other things I don't know about.  Nothing extraordinary but all perfectly reasonable things that it seems like real associates do, and definitely give a sense -- although a limited sense, since we're working on discrete, manageable assignments, since that's really all we can do at this point -- of what a young lawyer does.  So all of that is fine.  What's interesting, sort of, and it might just be the work they give to summer associates, and may not hold true in every kind of law, and may not even hold true more broadly than just the work that I happen to have been given, or the perception that I happen to have had so far -- or, actually, this probably isn't specific to the law at all, and holds true for all sorts of jobs -- but, well, despite being around people all day, it's kind of lonely job.  You're sitting at a computer and researching stuff, or reading stuff, or writing stuff, and you're checking in with people to see how you're doing, and you're going to meetings, and there's tons of people around... I expect that as people get more and more senior there's more brainstorming, more engagement with other people, thinking around a table, throwing ideas out, working together, being part of a team... at a lower level, I'm not sure when that kicks in.  Certainly it can't at a summer associate level -- we have no background, we have no experience -- but I don't know that I've gotten a sense of whether a junior associate has a much different experience or not; whether it's most of the day at your desk doing something by yourself, or if there's a substantial component of real interaction and thinking and working together and feeling involved, not just feeling like you're completing tasks in a vacuum.  I imagine this would have something to do with job satisfaction -- and that people who feel engaged and involved and part of a team are more satisfied than people who feel like they sit at their desk doing research all day... but obviously the research has to get done... and before you can be useful in a brainstorming session you need to have some idea what the parameters and rules are... I just don't know that I know when that kicks in -- year 1, year 5, or year 25.    Maybe this doesn't make any sense, and, honestly, this post has turned a lot more work-related than I intended to write.  The post I thought I was going to write was that sometimes you're around all of these people and you have nothing to talk about, and so it can feel a little lonely despite being surrounded by smart, decent people.  This post may be more interesting as it's turned out though.  I'm not really sure.  I'm just rambling I guess.  Oh well.

      It may be that everyone who wants one of these has got one, but the gmail account I got because I have a weblog, even though I never use the account, says I can invite 2 friends to have gmail accounts.  Since it would be pretty dorky for me to e-mail my friends and offer them gmail accounts, instead I'm offering them to you.  So, e-mail me if you want one.  Preference to someone who can provide a connection (or advice) to help me someday get my words printed in a publication of some sort.  :)  But even if you can't, I'd say it's worth a try to e-mail me if you want the invite.

      How many parts of a cow are there?  I just got back from lunch at the Brazilian Barbecue place (see pre-lunch post below).  They came around with meat after meat after meat, most of which had at one point been attached to a cow and not cooked.  It was these big meats on skewers that the waiters sliced off with sharp knives, sitting in pools of their juices.  It could turn someone into a vegetarian.  Not a good place to bring a date, I'd venture to say.  Unless you're dating a Tyrannosaurus.  Or [bad attempt to be funny coming] Carnie Wilson, assuming Carnie stands for Carnivore.  "I'll just have the salad" doesn't really work.  Heck, "I'll just have the parts of the cow that don't look they're still twitching" doesn't really work.  Then, once you've eaten the filet of leg, baby back tenderloin, rib eye, rib nose, rib ear, and barbecued cow toes, you get dessert.  It's a big cake, filled with meat, sliced off a skewer.  No, not really.  The desserts weren't that thrilling.  Too much meat though.  I didn't actually eat that much, it just felt like a lot.  I don't feel like eating until next Wednesday or so.  Or looking at any animals, since I think their parents were just served to the next table.  This was actually the first place where nothing served was baby anything.  This was grown-up animal.  Definitely adults.  I kept watching for the knife to slip and... a table full of lawyers?  No chance.

      I'm going to a Brazilian Barbeque restaurant with work people for lunch in a bit.  I've been to one before, but it was cheap, and I assume this one isn't as much.  Basically, it's all you can eat salad bar and assorted meat on skewers that waiters bring around and cut for you.  The one I went to started with easy stuff like beef and chicken and progressed to things like goat, rabbit, and gerbil (not the third one, but the first two).  Despite my embrace of ethnic cuisine of pretty much all sorts, I do draw the line at things that seem cuddly, like rabbits and gerbils.  And, besides, I'd filled up on salad bar.  I never feel like I get real value at all-you-can-eat places, because I'm not a big guy, and just can't eat that much.  But if I'm not paying... then it's fun to try stuff... and just leave most of it on my plate... so that's what I'm planning on doing for lunch.  One bite of things that seem interesting; no bites of things that look or sound disturbing; and nothing that looks like anyone else has sneezed on it.  That's my other problem with all-you-can-eat or salad bar places.  You never know how long that stuff has been out for... or what people have done to it... or who's breathing on it... there's an uncleanliness that makes me uncomfortable.  It's how people get food poisoning.  People here got sick a few weeks ago (I may have mentioned this in a prior post) at a restaurant from something called a Tower of Fish.  Which sounds awful.  I wouldn't eat that, or a Monument of Beef, an Obelisk of Chicken, a Statue of Lamb, a Pile of Pork, or a Mound of Dog.  Anyway, the gimmick at the Brazilian BBQ I've been to before was that you got a block painted half red and half green and if you wanted more meat, you put the green side up; if you didn't, you put the red side up.  Not sure whether that was red/green for stop/go, or if it had something to do with the colors of Brazil.  I don't know what those colors are.  This is going nowhere.  I will report back on what I eat, in gastronomically sufficient detail for any readers who may be hungry.

      Today I was in court all day, watching something and taking notes.  I noticed the other people sitting in court (not the lawyers up at the front who were doing actual talking) were doing crossword puzzles, playing games on their Blackberries (or just e-mailing A LOT), doodling, nodding off, and, in one case, reading what looked like the National Enquirer.  That seemed particularly bad.  Even marginally worse than one of the lawyer who was doing a crossword... FROM A BOOK OF TV GUIDE CROSSWORDS.  This is (presumably) a woman with a law degree.  Surely she could challenge herself with something more rigorous than a crossword from TV Guide.  1-Across:  The _________ Boat 2-Across:  The _________ Wheel 3-Across:  Actor Hanks  Ooh, gotcha there I bet.  The answer to 3-Across is Colin, not Tom.  So I was in court from 10AM-6PM or so.  We were given an hour lunch break.  I went to the nearby Amish Market, which was definitely not run by the Amish, because it had lights and refrigeration.  And sushi.  And empanadas.  And all sorts of things I bet the Amish don't use/eat/have/believe in.  It was cheating.  I don't understand it at all.  On the way back to the office on the subway I ran into someone I know.  That's been happening a lot this summer.  I must know a lot of people, or just be really lucky that way lately.  Tonight our firm social activity was a big reception at a public interest organization with a bunch of people from lots of other firms.  I feel okay saying this, because so many firms were there that I'm not actually revealing anything.  The organization deals with battered women.  The reception featured a performance by a rap group.  This makes sense, right?  Because rap songs never have any negative implications about women.  There was a "Chinese Auction" at the event.  A "Chinese Auction," to my surprise, does not involve Chinese babies being sold to the highest bidder.  Apparently it's like a silent auction, only with an ethnically insensitive name.  Different from a Jewish auction, where the lowest bidder wins.  I have an idea for a new consumer product to capitalize on the Atkins craze.  Low-carb shampoo.  Because shampoos are always advertising that they've got oatmeal, or fruit extracts, or rye bread in them.  All carbs.  I want a low-carb shampoo.  For a low-carb diet.  For a low-carb me.  :)

      Catching up on Q-and-A from All-Request-Day:  1. "There is a neighborhood kid who keeps pestering me.  I'd like to know how to make her disappear... she speaks in some sort of garbled English like Nell and she is about 4 feet tall.  I guess that makes her 4-5-6 or so."  Uh, not really my area of expertise.  But let's see.  You could move.  Or you could spray her with pepper spray.  That might be illegal though.  You could tell her parents.  You could yell at her.  Or perhaps you can just be nice to her and make a new friend.  Maybe she likes you.  Maybe you and she are meant to be together forever.  My answer sucks.  Sorry.  2. "After reading your summation of 3 years of Hell I thought maybe you could do a quick summary of the big Blawgs ala Talk Soup.  I don't know if talk soup is on TV still, I haven't had a TV since the mid 90's so I'm not too hip."  I've never seen Talk Soup.  I can only imagine.  I know Greg Kinnear used to host it before he got nominated an Academy Award, and then became known exclusively as "Academy Award Nominee Greg Kinnear," especially in movie trailers where he appears.  I can't recall a single movie he's been in since As Good As It Gets, so I'm guessing he hasn't been nominated for any more Academy Awards.  And you haven't had a TV since the mid-'90s, yet you watched Talk Soup when you did have one, which seems like a show designed for the especially TV-addicted -- a TV show all about other shows on TV, after all.  But back to your question.  I'm really not sure what to say.   urlLink Evan Schaeffer  does a weekly law school roundup on Sundays that sounds like exactly what you're looking for, actually.  And I don't want to compete with Evan on his own turf, so I'm sort of tempted to punt you over to him.  I suppose I could share a list of the blawgs I read more often than not, but I kind of don't even want to do that because I'll leave someone out and they'll feel bad and I don't want that.  There's lots of good stuff out there, I'm pleased you think this one's worthy of your time... I almost want to leave it at that.  3. "Business casual -- what's appropriate?"  Shirt.  Pants.  Socks.  Shoes.  I've been wearing button-down shirts and pants in various shades of navy, tan, and gray.  Seems to work.  Lots of blue shirts around.  Pretty straightforward.  Nothing that could be mistaken for a soccer uniform, pretty much.  Random related story -- I have a pair of pants that's made of some material lighter than cotton, I forget what, but it's very sensitive to water -- any drops of water show up very dark and very visible (and then dry and disappear, but still), so when I go to the bathroom, and then wash my hands, if the water from washing my hands at all drips on the pants, it looks like I peed on myself.  Which is not good.  But I like the pants.  So I don't know.  What a pointless story.  Sorry.  4. "What's your favorite type of food?"  They're all good.  I like Thai food a lot.  Greek food too.  I'm pretty adventurous with food (unless it has fallen on the floor -- see post from a couple of days ago).  I don't understand people who will only eat certain things.  Lots of things are good and interesting and tasty.  Appetizers and desserts are the two best parts of the meal too.  And food that tastes like it should be expensive but is actually really, really cheap is my favorite type of food.  For more on food, read  urlLink Waddling Kitchen  (or go to a supermarket).

      E-mail from a journal at school: "Just a reminder that the deadline for the notes competition is July 1. There are no entries in yet. That means that if you submit, you have a pretty darn good chance of winning the big money. Details are at the bottom of this email."  I found that amusing and worth sharing.  Don't know exactly why.  I went to court today, to watch and take notes.  This was actually the only time I'd been in a courtroom besides a high school trip to Washington where we sat in the Supreme Court visitors gallery while they announced something.  All I recall is Justice Thomas kept spinning around in circles in his comfy-looking chair.  Anyway, at this court thing lawyers said stuff and the judge said stuff and it wasn't very long and now I'm back.  Sorry if all those specifics bored you.  Things not to do in court: 1. Clap 2. Boo 3. Hiss 4. Jeer 5. Throw fruit 6. Throw vegetables 7. Throw up 8. Throw table over 9. Graffiti 10. Scream 11. Yell 12. Run 13. Brandish weapon 14. Use cell phone 15. Brandish cell phone 16. Use weapon 17. Brandish combination weapon-cell phone 18. Use combination weapon-cell phone 19. Call judge by wrong name 20. Call judge on his combination weapon-cell phone 21. Act like a monkey 22. Bring a monkey 23. Monkey around 24. Insult the court reporter 25. Start the wave 26. Ask if there's a promotional giveaway at today's hearing 27. Tickle the bailiff (was there even a bailiff?  Must've been...) 28. Eat 29. Drink 30. Be particularly merry

      We had a presentation at work today from some corporate partners talking about what they do.  It was actually a very solid presentation -- I came in knowing very little about what lawyers on the corporate side do, and left having a decent idea, sort of, a little bit.  But enough that a thought passed through my head that I've been playing around with since.  I have a macro-level lack of understanding about our economy that makes it absolutely impossible for me to have any appreciation for what corporate lawyers, investment bankers, hedge fund people, private equity folks, venture capitalists, and big businessmen do, or to have any idea why they're necessary.  I understand that we have all sorts of financial structures and rules and regulations and processes and forms and business arrangements.  I just don't understand what they are and why we need them.  This is at a level so far removed from the actual practice of these professions that it's not an indictment of anything or an opinion about the value of certain people in society -- it's just a general ignorance of what goes on and why that may or may not be important.  To me, if I have a business -- making sneakers, let's say -- I understand that I need leather, and thread, and people to sew them; I need factories, and trucks, and accountants to keep the books, and marketing people, and lawyers to make sure I don't do anything wrong; and some people to set strategy, and some people to sell my shoes, and a banker to collect my money... but I don't understand why these things require, say, bidding procedures, or compliance with something apparently known as the '40 Act.  Or why we may need to involve an investment bank in what we do, and get other people to put money into it.  And why all of this is so complicated and takes so many smart people to spend so many hours worrying about this.  All that should matter are the shoes.  See, as I write it, I realize I should have a better idea of what the business world looks like than I do, and it all probably comes off as very naive and unsophisticated.  But because I don't understand where these players fit, I find myself unable to imagine doing these things I see as abstract for a living and getting excited and passionate about them.  I just can't quite get myself to care.  And I don't say that in a bad way, but in the same way I might say that I just can't get myself to care about cricket because I've never seen a game and don't know any of the players.  I'm not saying cricket is a bad sport.  I just don't know the rules, and would hardly be inclined to choose to go watch, or play.  And I'd probably look a little skeptical at someone who did decide to go play, since I have no way of understanding his passion and his interest.  And, since I'm familiar with lots of other sports, and they get me interested and motivated, it's not like I'm dying to learn about cricket, or even have much of a desire at all to become an expert.  I'd rather just play baseball.  I've gone too far with the analogy, but this is kind of how I feel, in a way, about investment banking and securities law, and stuff like that.  It's cricket.  It may be a great sport.  But given what I know now, I can't imagine staying up all night measuring the paddles (do they even use paddles?), or figuring out whether to trade the catcher (do they even have a catcher), or even figuring out which channel the games are aired on.  (See, you hang around through the nonsense and eventually I say something substantive, right?)

      My All-Request Monday gone awry... the Internet was down most of the day at work.  All that was up was Lexis.  Seriously.  And,  urlLink jd2b  linked to me, which is always cause for celebration.  So I'm extending All-Request Monday to All-Request Tuesday, with the footnote that in fact it's Feel-Free-To-Request Day every day, since I do answer all my e-mails, without even the help of an assistant.  :)    I will get to the requests that came in today in due course.  Probably tomorrow, since I'm sleepy.  Tomorrow, incidentally, I get to go to court.  Not to do anything, obviously, although I think the associate mentioned that "we'll be taking good notes," which probably means me'll be taking good notes.  Which is totally reasonable, of course.  My response to the associate's e-mail inviting me to tag along: "I have to wear a suit there, don't I?"  The reply: "Yes."  Oh well.  My suit is lonely in my closet anyway.  BUT CLEAN.  And I don't want to get it dirty.  I'm probably mildly obsessive-compulsive in my dislike of dirt.  I've written before about trying not to touch the subway poles.  To me that seems reasonable though.  But stuff like food that falls on the floor -- I have a zero-second rule.  I wouldn't even think about it.  Or if I have any doubts about a food source -- I can't remember how old the milk is, or I think the sushi may be from yesterday, or I notice something crawling on the pasta.  All reasonable concerns, to me.  I don't like paint.  Or things that drip.  Not a huge fan of newsprint.  Okay, enough about my quirks.  Where was I?  Oh, yes, going to court.  To watch.  Cool.  The person who e-mailed me last week to say I haven't written enough about stuff I'm doing at work: this post is for you.

      As I was walking out of the subway station this morning, there was a cleaning person with a garbage pail full of cleaning fluid and a mop, washing the floor.  A well-dressed woman walked by and, thinking the garbage pail was a garbage pail, threw her Pottery Barn catalog in.  The cleaning person yelled after her, "Excuse me," she turned around, he said "this isn't a garbage pail," and fished out her sopping wet catalog and thrust it at her.  She had no choice but to take it.  So there she was, in her designer suit, carefully carrying a sopping wet Pottery Barn catalog, hoping not to drip it on herself.  Just thought I'd share.

      Monday is all-request day.   urlLink E-mail me  a question, an idea, a topic, anything, and you get a post.  Free!  Or I'll make some up.  In the meantime, you get an open letter to a law firm partner.  I don't know where I'm going with this until I write it.  First I wrote, "In the meantime, you get some unedited introspection," but I sat quietly for a few minutes and realized I don't have anything to say.  So I'll force myself into a structure and see what comes out.  Dear Law Firm Partner,  Thank you for inviting me to sit in on your conference call, even though I probably looked pretty disappointed when I realized that sitting in on your conference call would mean that I would have to miss the summer associate dwarf tossing event.  You'd be right to feel frustrated if my disappointment was evident.  After all, it's not like sitting in on your conference call is doing you any favors.  It's not for your benefit, it's for mine.  I'm of very little value to you during that conference call, unless you have a cardiac event and need me to run for help.  Besides that, perhaps I could take notes, but since I don't know what's important, my notes probably aren't going to be all that useful.  I understand that you invited me to sit in on the call because you want me to learn.  Which is the right thing for you to want, since besides the dwarf tossing and tomorrow's potato sack race, ostensibly I'm here this summer to learn as much as possible.  Even if it's not that exciting.  Thank you for handing me a copy of the tax code after you gave me the research assignment that came out of the conference call.  Even though I probably looked pretty disappointed with the idea of having to actually open the tax code to do the research.  You'd be right to feel frustrated if my disappointment was evident.  After all, despite everyone's friendly tone and willingness to accommodate requests as unnecessary as wanting to miss work on Friday because the circus is in town, and I love the circus, I imagine it's a real pain to give an assignment to a summer associate, and then get back something completely useless.  Not that completely useless work product isn't to be expected sometimes from someone who's never done this before -- but if there's a way to avoid it with some more effort or diligence on my part, I would think it's exasperating to discover that the time you spent explaining the assignment to me, the time you spent answering my basic, ill-thought-out questions, and the time you spent looking over my results, has all been for naught, and a regular associate is going to have to do the work anyway.  And thank you for not screaming when I hung up on the client by accident when transferring the phone call.  Using a telephone is hard, and you had every right to be upset at me for not reading the manual in advance and figuring out how to transfer a call, especially when I was told to read the manual and figure out how to transfer phone calls.  Finally, thank you for not asking me to miss the pony rides last Wednesday because the assignment you had given me was relatively urgent.  I would have missed the pony rides if you had asked me to, but I'm thankful you didn't force me to choose.  I appreciated that, because I really didn't want to miss the pony rides.  Also thank you for paying me.  Your friend, Summer Associate

      "Toothpaste"  --- EDITED SUNDAY NIGHT --- THIS IS A REWRITE --- ANY FEEDBACK WELCOMED  (OPEN ON: 6-YEAR-OLD BOY IN BATHROOM, STARING ANGRILY AT HIS TOOTHBRUSH)  BOY Mom!  This toothpaste tastes awful.  NARRATOR A parents hardest job is making sure her kid doesnt die.  But her second hardest is getting him to brush his teeth.  But not anymore.  (MOM ENTERS, CARRYING TWO TUBES)  MOM Try this!  (SHE HANDS HIM A TUBE.  HE READS THE LABEL.)  BOY (SOUNDING IT OUT, CONFUSED) Krazy glue?  MOM Oops.  Wrong one.   (SHE HANDS HIM THE OTHER TUBE)  BOY Willy Wonka toothpaste?  Cool!  (HE SQUEEZES SOME TOOTHPASTE ONTO HIS TOOTHBRUSH.  ITS BROWN.  HE STARTS TO BRUSH.)  BOY (WITH A MOUTH FULL OF TOOTHPASTE) This tastes just like chocolate pudding!  NARRATOR That's right. It tastes like chocolate pudding -- because it IS chocolate pudding.   MOM A toothpaste made of chocolate pudding?  Is that good for my sons teeth?  NARRATOR Of course not.  Heres a computer simulation.  (ANIMATED COMPUTER SIMULATION BEGINS.)  NARRATOR Ordinary toothpaste keeps teeth white and shiny. (THE ANIMATED TOOTH SPARKLES)  Our toothpaste turns them brown, and then they fall out. (THE ANIMATED TOOTH TURNS BROWN AND FALLS OUT)  But it tastes great!  MOM And thats whats important!  NARRATOR Exactly!  (THE BOY IS GULPING TOOTHPASTE DIRECTLY FROM THE TUBE.  A CLOSEUP INDICATES THE TOOTHPASTE ISNT SOLID BROWN, BUT HAS A TAN STRIPE)  MOM Is the tan stripe a whitening gel?  NARRATOR No, its caramel.  BOY (MOUTH FULL OF PUDDING) This is the best toothpaste ever!  NARRATOR Thats right.  Because its all natural.  Other toothpaste manufacturers use chemicals with long names no one can understand.  Tetrasodium pyrophosphate?  Sodium lauryl sulfate?  Fluoride?  We just use sugar, chocolate, and flour.  MOM Flour has some of the same letters as fluoride.  NARRATOR Exactly!  (BOY IS TRYING TO RINSE THE TOOTHPASTE CLEAN, BUT HE CANT)  BOY I cant get it off.  NARRATOR Thats because youre rinsing with water.  Willy Wonka toothpaste goes better with milk.  (MOM HEADS TO THE KITCHEN.  THE CAMERA FOLLOWS HER.  SHE OPENS THE REFRIGERATOR TO GET SOME MILK.)  NARRATOR While youre in the kitchen  I should tell you that Willy Wonka toothpaste contains baking powder.  MOM Baking SODA?  NARRATOR No, baking powder.  Check this out.  Just squeeze out drops of our toothpaste onto a baking sheet -  (MOM GETS OUT A BAKING SHEET AND DOES AS TOLD)  NARRATOR -- stick it in the oven (SHE DOES), and twenty minutes later (THE OVEN BELL DINGS), youve got brownies (SHE TAKES BROWNIES OUT OF THE OVEN).  MOM Wow!  Thats convenient.  But what do dentists think about Willy Wonka toothpaste?  NARRATOR They think were evil.  But -  MOM & NARRATOR It tastes great! (THEY LAUGH)  BOY (O.S.) Mom!  I need more toothpaste!  NARRATOR Willy Wonka toothpaste.  Wont clean your teeth, but it tastes great.  Now in snack size.  (JINGLE PLAYS: Willy Wonka Toothpaste... CAVI-TY-LICIOUS!)

      I've read some articles about how some people are upset that the media is turning Ronald Reagan into a saint now that he's passed away.  From one article: "'A lot of rewriting of history is taking place right now,' echoed Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a liberal Washington think tank tied to organized labor. Since the death of the 40th president at the age of 93 on Saturday, reverent recollections of 'The Gipper' have filled TV news programs, newspapers and magazines. Through anecdote and accolade, Reagan is remembered as the handsome actor who led a conservative revolution in winning landslide elections for two terms as California governor and two more as president. In his later years, the former president became a sort of national grandfather before sinking into the cruel fog of Alzheimer's disease.... 'Stop the sugar-coating,' columnist Joan Vennochi pleaded in the Boston Globe."  Well, you think this bad?  I've uncovered some clips from old newscasts that put the Reagan coverage to shame.  "Good evening, this is Edward R. Murrow.  Sad news from overseas today as Adolf Hitler has passed away at the tender age of 56.  Hitler is best known for designing the autobahn, the greatest interstate highway in the world.  He also loved ice cream.  A sad, sad day.  We've got Hitler confidant Frank Bratwurst on the telegraph with us.  Mr. Bartwurst, are you there?"  "Yes, yes I am."  "How do you feel today?"  "Very sad.  The world has lost a great friend.  No one has ever had a bad word to say about Mr. Hitler."  "Indeed.  Let's take a look at some childhood photos of Mr. Hitler."  [photos -- one of a young boy with a small moustache licking an ice cream cone; the next of a young boy with a small moustache riding on a sled; the next of a young boy with a small moustache herding Jews into a gas chamber.]  "With us now we have some Jews."  "Hello.  Shalom.  Are we on the air?"   "Yes.  What do you have to say about Mr. Hitler, now that he has died?"  "He was wonderful.  He was a friend.  He was meshuggeneh."  "Thank you.  Let's take a look at Mr. Hitler's burial site.  As he requested, his bosy will overlook the scenic Auschwitz concentration camp, where the Jews are being slaughtered at a rate of ten thousand per day."  [photo of burial site]  And that's not all... here's a clip from 1801.  "Good evening, this is Tom Brokaw.  Sorry to interrupt this week's episode of Little Hut on the Frontier, but I have some terribly sad news to report.  Noted American Benedict Arnold has passed away at the age of 60.  Benedict Arnold, dead at 60.  Despite an incident during the Revolution, Arnold had an extraordinary military career and the nation will mourn the loss of this great man..."

He's an incoming 1L who not only uses footnotes in his weblog, but uses them well.  The post I'm linking to, I'm linking to because of this:   Is the movie White Chicks with Shawn and Marlon Wayans going to be the worst movie of the summer? Of the year? Of the decade? My mom saw the commercial and said it looked funny.  I'm not going to comment on that, because I wouldn't want to say anything but nice things about my wonderful mom.

      From  urlLink Scotsman.com :   ONE of Edinburghs most prestigious legal firms has launched an investigation after trouble flared during a corporate weekend at a luxury timeshare development...   Among the allegations being investigated are that two members of the legal firms staff were physically assaulted by colleagues attending the corporate event.   Other employees have complained that drinks were thrown over them and that they were verbally abused.   Another senior Dickson Minto staff member was fished out of the hotels ornamental pond in the early hours of the morning after a marathon drinks session. Hotel workers offered to escort him to his room but he insisted on returning to the party...   The Evening News has been told that a female employee was slapped on the face and another had drink thrown over her. Others complained of being verbally abused. Despite complaints, police were not called to investigate the incidents...   A company source who was present at the weekend event said: "A lot of people were very upset about what had taken place. They were very angry that people had been headbutted and punched and that no action had been taken at the time...   A spokesman for the legal firm said: "We are making no comment whatsoever." Well, my summer job hasn't been *that* exciting so far.

      One of my fellow summer associates (thanks Andrew) e-mailed me an idea for a post about how awkward it is to see the lawyers in the bathroom.  It's hard enough to come up with things to say to them when you see them normally; but at the urinal?  "How's the summer going," they ask.  "It'll be going a lot better in three minutes when I finish up in here, actually."  The bathroom on my floor has 2 urinals and 2 stalls.  There's no partition between the urinals.  I don't know why.  They can afford it.  I mean, they have TV in the elevators; surely they can afford a partition between the urinals.  So I've noticed it's about a 50/50 split whether, if you're at one urinal, if someone will come over and use the other one, or just use a stall.  I wonder if it's a specific kind of person who uses the other urinal.  Timid people don't.  Timid people go to the stall, lock it, and don't come out until 5:30.  No, really.  I would never go use the other urinal if the first one is occupied.  It's uncomfortable.  They're too close together.  I saw one guy not wash his hands on the way out.  What do you say to a partner who doesn't wash his hands after using the bathroom?  Especially if he notices you, says we haven't met, and reaches out his hand to shake.  "Oh, no, uh, I think we met before.  Remember, I was in the elevator bank, and you were dripping with pee.  Remember?"  Some of the lawyers, mostly just in my imagination, bring their cell phones in with them, to continue their phone calls with clients.  "What's that sound?  I'm on vacation by a waterfall.  Doing work.  Yeah.  Doing work by the waterfall.  Oh, the other sound?  Cliff diving.  There I go.  Splash.  Avalanche.  Here they fall.  They're all coming down.  That other sound?  I'm squeezing through a narrow opening.  Sorry.  That other sound?  I don't hear anything.  Sorry.  Must be on your end."  We have billing codes for this stuff.  991 and 992.  You know the difference between the 1 and the 2.  Forgive me.  Potty humor is cheap.  I'm sorry.  Wasn't my idea.  :)

      I saw a play tonight with a friend, called "Chinese Friends."  It was not about Chinese people at all.  In fact, I'm not really sure what it was about.  If you go see it, I expect you too will leave wondering what exactly just happened to the past two hours of your life, and why you have no idea what in the world was going on in front of you.  I have no idea.  I just don't.  I'm pretty smart, but sometimes, whoosh, no idea.  I think it was making a political statement.  But gosh darn I have no idea what that statement was, besides perhaps "politics is confusing.  whoosh."  Yeah, so that's what I did.  Before I left work, I got to sit in on a conference call.  There were a bunch of lawyers from elsewhere on the call who were either drugged, attempting to pad their hours by talking as slow as possible, or inhabiting some other cosmic time zone where time moves at a different speed.  Perhaps my impression is only because I have no idea what they were talking about, but here's how it sounded to me:  Lawyer 1: "Soooooooooooooooooooo, do we thiiiiiiiiink that if we present thiiiiiiiiiiis theory fiiiiiiiiirst, then we miiiiiiiight be able toooooooooo eveeeeeeeeeeentuallllllllly wiiiiiiiiiiiiin points with the juuuuuuuuuuuuudge on that other theeeeeeeeeeeooooooooooooooory?"  Lawyer 2: "Caaaaaaaaaan yooooooooooou repeeeeeeeeat that, but slooooooooower?"  I don't know what the word "lugubrious" means, but I've decided it sounds like it should mean slow.  And so I will say that the conference call was lugubrious.  I'm not even going to look it up to check.  I'm just going to chance it.  How lugubrious of me.  I've decided (although my friend I saw the show with tonight gets about 50% of the credit for this one) that I want to make a mock parody film of that "Super Size Me" movie I saw last week.  In my version, I will film myself eating sensible meals from McDonalds and not gaining any weight.  Lines from my imaginary script:  "I think half a humburger is enough.  I'm full." "Actually, the salad sounds great today." "Would you like to supersize it?"  "No thanks." "Oh sh**!  Is that a HEAD in my Chicken McNugget??"  I've also decided to make another mock parody of "Super Size Me" called "Super Size My Kid."  In that one, I feed a child lots of McDonalds food and he gets really fat.  I think it would be a big hit.  I had lunch today at a steakhouse but I got the salmon.  It wasn't that good.  But I didn't really want the 48-ounce porterhouse, or anything like that.  Then they came around with the dessert tray.  I didn't want the 48-ounce carrot cake either.  It was huge.  I didn't think there were that many carrots in the universe.  The picture of the carrot drawn with icing on top of the slice was ACTUAL SIZE.  They also had a creme brulee, served in a swimming pool.  And some chocolate fondue that someone drowned in.

      If you read one book this week... :)  Yesterday on my commute, I read "Not Even Wrong," by Paul Collins.  It's a masterpiece.  It's a book about "Peter the Wild Boy," a nearly-mute, feral child in 1700s England.  And it's a book about the author's 3-year-old son, diagnosed with autism.  I'm making it sound dreadful.  But it's so well-written, so gentle, so touching... it's really quite remarkable.  Read it.    I'm grabbing from some reviews on Lexis, since I don't think I'm pimping this book as well as it deserves:   "Not Even Wrong," thankfully, includes us on a sweet, sad voyage into a disorder about which we know very little. Collins' book serves as a meditation on the meaning of "normal" -- and as a reminder that specialness can come to us in miraculous ways.  [M]ore than anything else, "Not Even Wrong" is an affecting portrait of a loving, charmingly eccentric family. Were irony not dead, or at least, cryogenically on hold, it might be ironic that such a "cold" affliction as autism (characterized by, along with everything else, a flat affect when dealing with people) has inspired such a warm (and smarm-free) memoir.  In a "happy ending" that breaks the reader's heart, Morgan gets to have a human experience on "our" terms. He reels from loneliness and desolation. But it's not sad, the author insists. "It's not a tragedy, it's not a sad story, it's not a movie of the week. It's my family." Brave man. Brave book. If you read two books this week... on Friday I read "Burning Down My Masters' House" by disgraced New York Times reporter Jayson Blair.  The first section, where he talks about his meltdown, and his trip to the psychiatric hospital, and life as a quickly-spiraling-downwards New York Times reporter is very, very compelling.  And then the book jumps back and does a life story leading up to the meltdown, which is much, much less interesting.  I found myself starting to skim.  I was hoping for more insight about the Times and what life is like there, but I didn't feel like I got it.  I got a biography.  The middle section, for me, fell flat.  The end picked up again a bit.  But it was missing a *very end* -- a "what the Times can do so people like me don't self-destruct," or "what I've learned and what's ahead," or both.  We get neither.  So read the first hundred pages, and then skip to the end, and read the last chapter or so.  That's all worth the read. The middle hundred and fifty pages, not so much.  Sorry.  (And, really, read Paul Collins' book on autism before you read this.  It's so good.  Really.)

      From a New York Times  urlLink article  about summer swimming:   What the Centers for Disease Control suggests to combat the parasite is increased vigilance by pool staffs and swimmers. Thus the agency's brochure "Fecal Accident Response Recommendations for Pool Staff: What Do You Do When You Find Poop in the Pool?" and its poster that looks like an eye chart. It poses the question, "Can you read this?" The letters of the chart say: "Have diarrhea? Don't swim."

      More about lunches, because that's my favorite topic lately.  So, like I've said, every morning at about 10:30, we start to get a barrage of e-mails on the summer associate list.  "2 spots left for lunch at Pan-Asian Bistro Grill.  First to reply get it."  Eight to twelve seconds later: "Lunch full."  "1 spot for lunch with Litigation associates at Fusion Gardens.  Preference to those I haven't had lunch with yet."  Eight to twelve seconds later: "I've received 31 replies, but Carol's came before I even pushed send, so she gets it.  Sorry!"  "Might have two spots left for a lunch I'm putting together at Genetically Modified Fish Spa this afternoon.  Preference to those with killer smiles."  Eight to twelve seconds later: "One more spot has opened up.  Preference to those not wearing socks."  Eight to twelve seconds later: "Changed my mind. Preference to those who don't smell like cheese."  Eight to twelve seconds later: "No, actually, you do smell like cheese."  Eight to twelve seconds later: "Sorry, I meant that just to go to Jim, not the whole list."  Eight to twelve seconds later: "Lunch full.  For now.  Ha ha ha."  Just getting into a lunch has become the game of the day.  But once you're there.... I've figured out two things:   (1) Expensive food loses its ethnicity above a certain point.  Everything becomes fusion no matter where it starts.  "Miso-glazed salmon" is simultaneously high-end French, Chinese, American, Japanese, German, Swiss, and Ethiopian.  "Lobster-glazed pork," unbelievably, becomes kosher if priced above $26.  As prices go up, food becomes younger.  Baby greens, baby octopus, baby lamb chops, baby veal, and baby pudding.  I'm kidding about the baby pudding.  So far.  And dessert is the best part of every meal, even if "exotic Asian fruit tower" turned out to be apple pie, and "honeydew granita" turned out to be green-colored italian ices.  At one restaurant, the waitress describing the dessert almost strained the bounds of credibility: "The chocolate-mocha layer cake is quite extraordinary.  It's a layer of chocolate," she said, tracing a layer in the air with her finger, "followed by a layer of mocha, then a layer of chocolate, and a layer of mocha, and a layer of chocolate, and a layer of mocha, and a layer of chocolate, and a layer of mocha--" I was getting the drift.  How many layers were in this cake? "--and a layer of chocolate, and a layer of mocha, and a layer of chocolate--"  This is why these are three-hour lunches.  She's still describing the dessert.   (2) Too much food.  I go out to one of these lunches and four days later I'm still full, still digesting the baby tuna steaks with the baby asparagus and the baby cheesecake.  I can't eat dinner, I can't eat breakfast... until someone offers to pay for those meals, too.  And I come back to the office and I'm ready for a nap.  Like a baby.  Octopus.  Grilled atop a wild mushroom ragout with baby field greens dressed in balsamic vinegar and pine nuts with a side of crisped leek and smoked kale and braised plum and seared shark and chewed steak.  And some homemade verisimilitudes and a side of slurvy.

      Another try at a commercial parody.  This may or may not be better than the other two; but I thought maybe I'd try to get inspired by my surroundings.  (Lights up on a law office.)  LAWYER I have three questions for you.  Number one, do you have a checkbook?  Number two, have you done anything lately?  And number three, uh, do you have a checkbook?  If you can answer "yes" to one or more of these questions, you may be eligible for a settlement.  Call us.  And remember our motto.  "You don't get paid, until we get paid."  It's easy.  Let's hear from a client.  UNAPPEALING WOMAN I did something.  And had a checkbook.  So I called.  And they got money.  Maybe I did too.  I can't remember.  LAWYER See, a client.  And you can be too.  We fight for people to whom things happen.  Or who see things happen.  Or who only hear about them.  And we fight about as hard as we need to.  To make sure we get paid.  And if there's anything left, you get paid too.  Sometimes.  It's how we've done business for over 75 years.  Let's hear from another client.  CONFUSED MAN I signed something.  I think.  I don't know.  What else did you want me to say?  LAWYER Another client.  We've got lots of them.  More after each one we get than we had previously.  All built around our slogan.  "You don't get paid, until we get paid."  It's easy.  We could write a jingle.  But we haven't.  Because we're too busy fighting for us.  And, perhaps, when we have a chance, our clients.  Fall down?  Didn't fall down?  Saw someone fall down?  Heard someone fall down?  Read about someone who once fell down?  Assume someone must have once fallen down?  Call us.  We'll help.  Someone.  Probably ourselves.  Let's hear from another client.  GROWN MAN PRETENDING TO BE A CHILD I'm a child.  Things happen to children.  It's scary.  They help.  All better.  LAWYER We love children.  With checkbooks.  Sometimes they don't understand our slogan, so we simplify it for them.  "In the event there is money that someone gives to us because something may or may not have happened to you, we take that money.  Sometimes, after we have taken as much as we can, we give some to you.  Or we don't.  It depends.  But in all cases, you do not get any money unless we have reached a point where we have gotten money.  Understand?"  Of course they don't understand.  They're children.  We love children.  They sign wherever we tell them.  Let's hear from another client, and his translator.  DOG Bark.  Bark bark.  Bark bark bark.  Bark bark bark bark bark.  DOG TRANSLATOR Something happened to me.  I have no idea what.  After all, I am just a dog.  They got money.  I got my belly rubbed.  Seemed fair to me.  I have to go poopy now.  LAWYER People sometimes ask us how much money we have made.  The answer is easy.  Then they ask how much our clients have received.  That answer is hard.  Surely you don't really want to see our boring, complicated, hard-to-understand records that we constantly shred.  You just want to hear from more clients.  OLD WOMAN I live in luxury thanks to the work of these fine lawyers.  This is the best nursing home in the world, except when they hit me.  LAWYER Thanks, mom.  And you can be our client too.  When things happen, or even when they don't, call us.  We're here to help.  And remember, "you don't get paid, until we get paid."

      We had a breakfast event this morning, and there was a pretty substantive buffet breakfast.  One of the items on the line were miniature bagels, on a platter with some smoked salmon.  So I took a bagel, and a piece of salmon.  And I get to the table, and I open the bagel.  And it was pre-cream-cheesed.  They had already put cream cheese on the bagels.  Astonishing.  This is how good they treat us.  They put cream cheese on our bagels for us.  Amazing.  (Is that what paralegals do?)

      Thanks to  urlLink Evan Schaeffer  for his kind words about my blog.  His is another on the short list of stuff I regularly read.  Feedback is running in favor of Stampons over Democratic Debate so far, so given that I haven't been inspired with anything better, I guess I'll use Stampons at the first meeting of the sketch writing workshop I signed up for tomorrow night.  Figured it could be fun, a way to get some live feedback, motivate some writing, meet some other writers, etc.  And as long as I'm in Manhattan at work, I may as well do stuff after work that's fun.  Not that work isn't fun.  Of course work is fun.  Obviously.  The Tony Awards are on in a bit.  I'll probably watch them in the background as I write something percolating in my head about lunches paid for by the firm.

      This is post #1200.  The new Blogger interface tells me so.  Getting to round numbers are fun.  1200 is a big number.  And I've been doing this for not quite 2 years (a year and 10 months), so that's a little less than 2 posts a day on average, if my math is right.    Anyway.  Over at  urlLink NeoTokyoTimes , which is one of just -- counting in my head, give me a second -- 5 law-or-law-student blogs I check fairly regularly (bonus points to anyone who wants to guess the rest of the list; I'm defining fairly regularly as close-to-daily), there's a comment I find thought-provoking:   More and more I'm beginning to believe that my tendency to play social butterfly has too often left me in the lurch when people who decide to do things invite only their "primary friends" of which I am not considered. People don't believe that I consider all of my friends "primary friends," and that they must think that they're considered by me as "secondary friends." I suppose their assessment is probably correct. More than ten "primary friends" probably means that they're actually all secondaries. This is phenomenally sad. I have nothing tremendously substantive to say in response, but it got my attention because we don't usually get to know how other people think about stuff like this.  And when I read "social butterfly" in the first line, the image I get -- and it's just because the term makes me think of the obnoxious phony people schmoozing at cocktail parties, trying to shake everyone's hand and figure out whether you can help their career, and if you can't you're useless and they're off to find another conversation -- is of someone who's collecting friends like trading cards, not necessarily of someone who cares about his depth of relationships, so it's interesting just to know how someone else thinks about this stuff.    For me -- and this may be revealing too much about what goes on inside my head, I suppose -- I have some of the same worries, but coming from the other direction -- just to use NeoTokyo's terminology because I don't have anything better -- I feel like I have pretty good intuition when I meet someone whether he or she is someone I'd want to be friends with, whether I think he or she is a good person, who I'd want to know.  But the relatively tentative, shy part of me isn't always sure how to translate that into actually becoming friends, and I think I tend to overthink stuff, trying to figure out how to "convert" the acquaintance into a friend, but also wanting to make sure I'm not wrongly thinking the other person would want to be friends with me.  (Of course, this is only magnified when I'm thinking about whether if I ask a girl on a date, I think she's actually interested or not -- I feel like I have good instincts as to whether I'll like somebody, even just after meeting them for a moment, but I don't feel like I trust my instincts at all about whether she likes me back and am usually pretty clueless... and I'm not sure how one gets better at that... but probably everyone feels the way I do, on some level, unless they're just so taken with themselves that they feel everyone must like them... which may not be terrible for the one who feels that way....)  These are some massive run-on sentences with all the dashes and ellipses.  Sorry about that.  And I think I'm revealing too much about the inner workings of my head.  Oh well.  I'll live.

      Questions not to ask when meeting members of the firm's executive committee:  1. How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? 2. Do all lawyers go bald? 3. Say I have a "friend" who's embezzling money from the law firm where he's a summer associate.  Is that so bad?  4. What's the absolute fewest number of hours an associate can work, and still not get fired? 5. Is that your wife, or your grandmother?  6. Is that your wife, or your granddaughter? 7. Do you really not have control over your bowels, or is that just a rumor? 8. You didn't pick out that tie yourself, did you? 9. I forget, how many justices are on the Supreme Court? 10. How about you pay me in cash, and then neither of us have to report it on our taxes?

      Dress at the firm is usually business casual, which I've come to believe is a phrase invented by someone who did not own any shorts or polo shirts, and wouldn't know what to do with a sandal if he stepped in it.  Although if he was smart, once he stepped in it he would probably figure it out pretty quickly.  Anyway, today we had to wear a suit.  And in a truly rare accomplishment, I got the tie right on the first try.  Not too long, not too short, just right.  Isn't it sad that I thought that was worth writing about??

      I went to the Yankees game tonight with some friends, bleacher seats.  Weather held out; good game; lots of scoring in the first inning; the rest of the game was pretty normal, but stayed close so it was fun.  They frisk you for any weapons when you go in -- and then hand you one.  It was light-up pen night.  These things were heavy and dangerous.  And then they put up on the scoreboard that Yankees Ice Cube Tray night was coming up soon.  Ice cube tray night??  That sounds dangerous too.  And relatively useless.  I was waiting for them to advertise Yankee Letter Opener night or Yankee Axe Day to really get things exciting.  People were not friendly to the guy in the bleachers with a Red Sox jersey on.  They called him names.  Why come to a Yankees game in a Red Sox jersey?  They weren't even *playing* the Red Sox.  I had sushi for lunch at work today.  It was okay, but for the price it should have been phenomenal.  It was definitely not 6 times better than sushi I would normally eat, even though it cost about 6 times more.  The plates were nice.  I don't know what else to say about the sushi.  I'm still alive, so I guess it was fresh enough.  We thought the waitress said they had Crab Miso soup; we discovered when she brought soup with shells in it that it was Clam Miso soup.  That's just as it sounds.  It was tolerable, but don't seek it out.  How much more about sushi can I say?  I recommend sitting in on conference calls, just as a default activity to volunteer for if you're at a firm with not much to do.  You get to feel like you're working when really you're just eavesdropping.  It's fun.  I accidentally sent a file to my "RightFax Printer" because I pushed enter too quickly.  I have no idea where that took it.  I did not see it again.  I am hoping it just vanished into etherspace.  Someone e-mailed me saying my paragraphs are too long.  Not today.  Really, I mean it.  Not today.  I'm making up for it.  That same e-mail asked why I don't have comments.  I do have comments.  It's called "e-mail me."  The last thing I want, like I told her, is to post something funny and have someone comment funnier.  My blog, my funny.  Your blog, your funny.  Makes sense, right?  I think so.  Not like I'm commenting on national security here.  Got another e-mail that's really nice, saying this is better than a blog of some guy on the toilet in Utah.  Very nice.  I appreciate e-mail like that.  Tomorrow is Thursday.  That was quick.  4-day weeks.  Cool stuff.  I'm sleepy.

      Every morning, a bunch of e-mails go out from summers who have lunch plans, looking for people to join them -- the rule here is a 1:1 summer:associate ratio, so if an associate invites you to lunch, they might say they'll grab 2 of their friends, so you should find two summers to join.  Usually, demand for these is pretty high -- getting to go to lunch with the firm paying the bill is a pretty good deal, plus you get to meet some new people.  So what's been happening is a bunch of e-mails, "I need two more for lunch at Wendy's, first 2 to respond" (although not Wendy's -- perhaps Chez Wendy's, or Wendy's Sea Grill, or Wendy's Luxury Bistro) and literally 90 seconds later, another e-mail that says "Lunch full."  People are all over these e-mails.  I used to write back something like "I'd love to come if there's still space," but that's too many letters.  If you don't type something as short as "Me!" and immediately press send, you're going to miss out.  I'm at a slight disadvantage because my computer doesn't have sound -- so I have to watch for the little Outlook envelope to appear in the bottom-right of the screen.  It's like a game.  And then at around 11:30, e-mails that say "Anyone have an extra space?" start to come around the list -- as if anyone has an extra space they haven't already bidded out to the fastest finger.  And then, at around 12:00, "Anyone without lunch plans want to meet in the lobby at 12:15 to lick associates' fingers as they return from their meals?"  Or something less degrading than that but still pretty desperate sounding.  I was successful today, with the self-deprecating "Me?" response, seconds after receiving an e-mail.  But have failed in the past.  Lately, some people have included criteria -- "preference to those I haven't had lunch with before."  No one has been so bold as to write "preference to those I've met and like, as opposed to those I've met and don't."  For the first time, I have a lunch invite at my disposal.  An extra space for a lunch on Friday [Edited to add: Not anymore.  Sorry.].  Planning ahead.  I haven't yet sent out my e-mail about it, but I'm tempted to try and be marginally amusing, which will probably be a failure.  But, honestly, what if the first person who writes back is the guy who smells.  No, I'm kidding, there isn't anyone (I've noticed) who smells.  But, you know, you click with some people better than others and maybe you want more of a criteria than "first to respond."  But "person I think I like the best of those who respond, at least from what I know so far" is kind of rude.  So -- here's some of the criteria I'm thinking about:  1. Preference to those who will not immediately ask the associates, "so what kind of law do you do?" and shape the entire conversation around work.  2. Preference to those with some outside interest of some sort, anything really, just something you're interested in, and, in the right situation, could end up in a genuinely engaging discussion about it.  3. Preference to those who don't have loud bodily functions that are normally active at the lunch table.  4. Preference to those who know less about which piece of flatware to use than I do, so I'm not the only one who feels stupid.  5. Preference to those who chew with their mouths closed.  6. Preference to those who will sympathize with me if I say something trying to be funny that just completely falls flat, instead of joining the associates in looking at me like I'm an idiot.  7. Preference to those who will insist we order dessert.  8. Preference to those who do not want to know the difference between corporate and litigation, how to study for the bar exam, what the most exciting part about being a lawyer is, or why the associates chose this firm over any others.  I've covered those topics.  9. Preference to those who are not jerks.  10. And, actually, if anyone reads this before I send the e-mail out to the firm's list: Preference to anyone who reads my weblog.  :)

      I'm making up for yesterday's short post with a half-dozen posts today I guess.  No reason, just more to say.  Anyway,  urlLink Sua Sponte has a post  about her "summer turn[ing] serious" that makes me feel a little bit ill:   [W]e're competing over a finite number of seats in our preferred practice groups.... If I can stay active in both of my potential practice groups of choice, if I can book enough completed projects in the summer associate database and enough face time with people whom I'd like to remember my name, then I don't see a need to game the system any further. Look, maybe she's right.  Maybe people need to "game the system" to get what they want.  I don't know.  I don't want to think so.  I want to think we live in a world where the things that are supposed to happen to us happen to us because we deserve them.  And if we don't get the things we think we want, maybe we're not supposed to want them, or maybe we just don't deserve them.  This is a view of the world that presupposes some sort of fate or destiny, I guess.  And maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe it's all on our shoulders.  Maybe it's all in how we "game the system."  But something inside me tells me maybe it's not.  Wait a second.  That wasn't what I intended to write.  What I intended to write is that this seems like an awful lot of psychic energy to be spending on what practice group you're going to end up in, when, in large part, it's in other people's hands.  But maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe the world is a soul-crushing place.  Maybe these are really the things it's worth our energy to be worrying about.  Maybe we're not meant to just enjoy our lives and the gifts we're fortunate enough to have.  I hope not.  And, no, I don't know exactly how Sua Sponte's post is related to what I just wrote. :)

      I saw the movie  urlLink Garden State  this evening.  I'd read some reviews (that link is to the Rotten Tomatoes site), and they were pretty much all glowing, and I was really excited about seeing the movie.  But I didn't get it.  For me, it didn't work.  It was scattered, the characters were unsympathetic, it just didn't do it for me.  Not fun to sit through.  Oh well.

      Sherry at Stay of Execution  urlLink points out some pretty sad stuff that happens to lawyers :   When you're a lawyer, time is money, right? And so every coffee or lunch break you take to catch up with a friend is time you're not billing.... Don't they understand that this time has a price? Maybe it's free for them, but it's not for you. Conversely, if you're having lunch with another lawyer, someone more senior than you, whose time is worth lots more (or at least, whose billable rate makes their time more expensive), you feel a sort of strange gratitude. You expect them to get through the lunch and then briskly bring things to a close and get back to the office. If they linger or suggest coffee, well, wow, that's so generous, what a good guy this is.... Gosh.  I don't want to be measuring my leisure time by what it's costing me.  This friend's worth $100 but this other one's only worth $50?  What if I have lunch with both of them at once?  $75?  $150?  Come on.  This is bad.  Bad bad bad.  Shouldn't we be doing things because we enjoy them?  Is this what happens to lawyers?  Does billing time at work take over one's life?  Bad.  Bad bad bad.

      The Mets just traded their future for two mediocre starting pitchers who will help them finish in fourth place this year.  Ridiculous.  They traded their top pitching prospect (Scott Kazmir), their top hitting prospect (Justin Huber), a solid utility infielder (Ty Wigginton), a solid pitching prospect (Matt Peterson), and some guy I never heard of but based on the rest of this is probably the next Roger Clemens (Jose Diaz) for Kris Benson and Victor Zambrano, who are just not that good.  It is mind-boggling why the Mets would do this.  Mind-boggling.  It would be like trading your three-year-old child for a parakeet.  It doesn't make any sense.  So I'm now taking suggestions on what team to root for instead, because I'm not watching any more Mets games.  I want a team with upside.  The Padres are my first thought.  Maybe the Twins or the Indians.  Anyone have any suggestions?  Tell me why I should join your bandwagon.  Really, I'm shopping for a new team.  Heck, it doesn't even need to be a baseball team.  I'll root for the Liberty instead.  The Mets don't deserve to win another game, ever.

      Went on a field trip this morning to the  urlLink New York Mercantile Exchange , which is a big trading floor where people trade, in person, in oil and other physical commodities.  Basically, they wear brightly colored jackets and yell at each other.  Think a racetrack, without the horses.  Or a casino, but with a clock.  Or a cockfight, but without the chickens.  That one may work the best, since there are rings where people trade, and stuff like that -- and, I assume, there are rings at cockfights where the animals fight.  I guess.  I think the only cockfight I've seen was in the movie "Fight Club," and I only saw half of the movie, so maybe I'm imagining the cockfight.  I have no idea.

      I got nothing.    I mean, I could spit out something like "Top Ten Signs Your Memo Is Too Long" (#4: The index has an index) or "Top Ten Excuses for Not Finishing Your Assignment On Time" (#7: Lunch was 142 hours long), but I'd just be going through the motions.  I could make a joke about political figure "Deep Throat" dying today ("No, no, not Monica Lewinsky") but that would be cheap.  I could link you to some interesting stuff on other blogs (like  urlLink here  or  urlLink here ), but that's always a last-resort kind of tactic.  I could talk about the really flexible new toothbrush I bought and how it's totally rocking my oral hygiene world, but there's only so much I can say about a toothbrush.  I could talk about  urlLink the book I started reading on the way home tonight  and how I think it's really interesting so far, but I'm only on page 31, so I can't really be sure it'll hold up for the whole book.  But I've got nothing.  So I'll just give you this mess of a post and hope it's enough.

      The day before I started my summer job, I remember I posted a set of "expectations" for the summer.  Just two and a half weeks from the end of this stuff, I thought I might revisit and see if my expectations were right.   1. I expect to learn just how many shades of blue there are. I don't mean sadness. I mean blue like in dress shirts.    Well, that came true, I guess.  Lots of people wear blue.  I bought one new blue shirt since writing that, and I wear it a bunch.  People wear tan too.  And occasionally pink or white.  What a dumb expectation.  This would have been cooler if I'd been a little more serious with this post.  But I'll get there.  This has the potential to be a long rant about something, although who knows what at this point.   2. I expect to be able to more fully articulate the differences between Lexis and Westlaw, what one has and the other hasn't...   Well, not really.  I liked Lexis better before, and no one gave me a reason to switch.  We had training in both, but I haven't done tons and tons and tons of research -- I've certainly done some, but not enough where I needed to make sure I was using whichever one is "better," whatever that means.  I learned there's no reason to care about Lexis, Westlaw, and which one to use.  I won a contest the Lexis rep e-mailed us about last week though -- and was promised an Amazon.com gift certificate.  Got the gift certificate yesterday.  It's for $5.00.  I mean, that's better than nothing, but it's not really all that much.  What can I buy on Amazon for $5?  Anyway, I'll keep using Lexis anyway, because I like it better.  I don't know why.  The earth tones color scheme maybe.   3. I expect to participate in a lot of summer associate events, in fact probably the same number and exactly the same type as my friends at other firms around the city.   Sure.  Lots of stuff.  We've had some really nice events.  With good food, or a nice thing to watch, or a cool place to be.  They're all really well-planned, and there's no reason they shouldn't be really fantastic.  But after a while -- I don't know, in a way they start to feel the same after a while.  In a way, we get too used to going to doing cool things, which is a terrible thing to be complaining about, and I'm not really complaining.  But you're sort of still paying attention to what you're saying, since there are lawyers all around... so in a way it feels a little more like still being at work than just being at this fun thing for the sake of the fun thing.  Which is unavoidable, and expected, and obviously not horrible by any stretch, but just is part of what it is.  But it's been nice to have them.  I'm glad I got to see "Wicked."  I'm glad I've gotten to do a whole bunch of things I would never have paid for.  But I'm also glad I didn't make a decision about which firm to work at based entirely on the list of events, because that would have been sort of silly in retrospect, probably sillier than it would have seemed at the time.   4. I expect to get tired of eating in nice restaurants, since I hear I will end up having a lot of nice lunches.   Definitely.  Unfortunately.  By now, 10 weeks in, part of me would almost rather eat some $4 falafel than some of the $60 meals I've had.  Not that they're bad, but at a point we get too used to them, and in a way they're just not that special.  And sometimes it's hard to make conversation with people you don't really know -- the partners and associates are surely mostly nice, but if you don't know each other... and you're not, say, my grandmother, who can talk to anyone at any time about anything and make a new best friend, sometimes it clicks and sometimes it's, well, sort of more like torture to have to sit there.  Despite the food.  But it's nice to have the chance, and nice to get out of the office and talk to people over a meal instead of over a desk, and nice not to pay for lunch and have people to eat with.  So thumbs up, even though I'm probably never going to want to eat in a nice restaurant ever again.   5. I expect to like it. I mean, everyone says it's a lot of fun, I'll get to meet some students from other schools, meet some lawyers, figure out what it is lawyers do, go to some cool events and activities, eat in nice restaurants, see some things besides the inside of a classroom, really what's not to like.   I'm glad I did this for a summer.  I've met a bunch of people from other schools, met some lawyers, figured out what lawyers do... all that stuff.  But as I write this post, I'm thinking the post I would rather have looked back on is a post I didn't write, not about my expectations for the summer, but about my goals.  I'm not exactly sure what my goals would have been -- and maybe that's why there wasn't a post about them.  In a way, they would have been sort of like the expectations, but not entirely -- I mean, I expected to go to nice restaurants, but I wouldn't really call that a goal.  And the blue shirt thing doesn't make any genuine sense in any context I guess, but at least it was excusable as merely an "expectation."  Maybe I didn't write about my goals for the summer because I didn't really know what they were.  But I also don't have a post about my worries for the summer, even though I know I had some.  I wasn't worried about the work -- no reflection on me -- I don't think anyone should be worried about the work.  I expected they weren't going to give us stuff we couldn't reasonably be capable of doing, and I don't know that I've spoken to anyone who has felt unprepared to do legal research or anything else they've been asked to do.  We may not understand the context of the assignments, but I get the strong sense everyone at the firm knows what we can do and they've been doing this long enough that there's really no reason to worry about the work.  I was in the fortunate position to not have to move to a new city I was unfamiliar with, where I didn't know anyone, so I wasn't too worried about finding stuff to do outside of work, or living/working in NY, or anything like that.  That absolutely would have been a worry if I'd been going anywhere else, and is certainly, all else being equal, a reason why I didn't even really consider it.  I've done the job-in-a-new-place-for-a-while before and didn't really feel like doing it again.  I was worried I wouldn't get any real writing done this summer, and that was actually a pretty legitimate worry, because I hoped to have done more, on a bunch of different projects, but it's hard when you're in an office all day, and even if not busy 100% of the time, it's still hard to focus.  But I can't really blame myself for that, and I've been reasonably prolific on here, and gotten a little bit done elsewhere, so I'm just being hard on myself if I feel too bad about it.  I can't make myself do more than I can do.  Before the summer, I asked a friend who worked at a firm last summer how many friends he made -- how many people he was still in contact with from his summer class, that were people he'd do stuff with outside of work, that were actual friends more than just co-workers.  He said 1 or 2, and that seemed like a reasonable hope.  I was probably more concerned than I needed to be about making friends at work -- it's only 13 weeks, I have friends outside of work, etc -- but it's nice to make new friends, to find new people you connect with, to make the work day not so lonely.  And that's been much better than I feared it had the potential to be, and certainly a bigger plus than the nice restaurants and free paper clips, no contest.  I don't know where this post started out intending to go, but everything that gets this long does so with a mind of its own.  It's just another in the "what summer at a firm is like" series, I guess.  Am I really writing for anyone except the man inside my head at this point?  I mean, no one's reading this far, especially without paragraph breaks.  :)

"Yeah, but this shouldn't be too bad." "Okay.  What's the client number?" "It's not for a client.  It's for me.  I'm selling my kids." "Excuse me?" "I'm selling my kids.  No time to deal with them."

      A little bit of catch-up:  Thursday night we went to see the Broadway musical "Wicked" as a law firm event.  It's a spectacle.  I say that in a good way.  Lots of set pieces, special effects, etc.  The music is OK but not thrillingly memorable and catchy -- you won't leave humming too much.  The lyrics are fine but didn't blow me away.  The story is interesting more than anything else.  The singing was excellent.  There's a really lovely ballad in Act Two called "For Good" that I really liked.  Not giving anything away, it's basically the story of the lives of the good witch and the wicked witch leading up to when the wicked witch melts.  That gives nothing away.  In the back of my mind, I feel like I could write an interesting article tying some of the themes in "Wicked" to the practice of law, but that would be a forced comparison made sensible only by virtue of the fact that this was a law firm event.  I'm going to let that idea simmer for a while and see if anything comes out of it.  Today (Saturday) I went to Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey with some friends.  Roller coasters are cool.  They've made some cool new ones since the last time I was in any amusement park a bunch of years ago.  Because the weather predicted rain, the park wasn't too crowded so the lines weren't bad at all -- plus it never rained.  Best of both worlds, except that any faith I may have had in weather forecasters is gone now.  Really.  I will not check the weather ever again.  They lie.  :)  And, a TV recommendation -- I've watched a few episodes of "Crossballs" on Comedy Central, a fake debate show like Crossfire and Hardball, where actors pose as experts and debate real experts who don't know they're actors.  There's potential for it to be really, really funny -- it executes the concept decently, but not perfectly, so it ends up being merely funny.  But merely funny is still worth watching, I think.  It is not totally unlike HBO's "Da Ali G Show" which I caught last Sunday.  Also the show the preceded "Ali G" called "Entourage" was a solid watch as well.  Add in "Last Comic Standing" and I believe I've just listed every TV show I've watched in the past week except for an inning or two of yesterday's Mets game.  3-5 hours a week seems like a safe level of TV watching, I think.

      TO: All members of the firm RE: Appropriate and inappropriate interview questions  With recruiting season upon us, I wanted to ensure that we do not repeat some mistakes from the past, as well as ensuring we do not run afoul of the law.  Please heed the following points carefully, especially if you're disabled, since you're the first ones we'll fire in a downturn anyway.  1. It is very important to be sensitive to issues of race.  Do not acknowledge the candidate's race in any way, even if you have the best intentions in mind (e.g., examples from last year, telling a student who was either Scandanavian or just had really fair skin how the salary will allow him "enough money to visit the Nordic homeland," or insisting the firm "needs you for the diversity brochure.")  However, if you do find yourself making a reference to someone's ethnic background, please at least be accurate.  Recall the problem last year when Don asked the slightly overweight Canadian student if he was a sumo wrestler, leading to a puzzled reaction.  Finally, do not overcompensate with hyperbole.  "I have never met a person like you I didn't like" is not appropriate small talk.  Especially not when followed up with, "of course, I live in a gated community and my father was a Nazi."  2. Similarly, gender is a very sensitive area.  Despite what normally passes for appropriate talk in the office, do not refer to female candidates as "bitches."  Please keep that kind of language limited to non-interview situations or when the candidate is not within earshot.  Also, references to how much you would like the chance to get a particular candidate pregnant are usually not appropriate, with some exceptions (see Appendix A).  Finally, don't tell any female candidates about the mandatory sterilization for first-years.  3. It is unfortunate that 'political correctness' has made it impossible for us to continue using our old evaluation scale ('genius,' 'normal,' 'retard').  Instead, we will use numbers corresponding to those three levels: "1," "2," and "absolutely not, due to apparent mental illness, or just doesn't seem Protestant enough."  Please stick to those terms.  4. Don't tell Jewish candidates about the annual pig roast.  When in doubt, assume all candidates from Ivy League schools are Jewish.  5. Moving on, please refrain from using stereotypes about certain undergraduate institutions when conducting the interview.  "I see you went to the University of Florida.  I think I saw you in a Girls Gone Wild video" is not appropriate for an on-campus interview, although standards are more flexible during call-backs.  6. Do not vomit on the candidates.  Even if they are ugly.  Thank you for your attention to these matters.  Especially the morons on floor 17.

      I just saw  urlLink Before Sunset , a&nbsp;modest little film by Richard Linklater.&nbsp; It's a sequel to a 1995 film, "Before Sunrise," about an American&nbsp;man and a French woman who meet&nbsp;on a train headed toward&nbsp;Vienna one day and fall in love --&nbsp;but he has to leave the next day.&nbsp; They don't exchange information, but promise to meet 6 months later, to the day,&nbsp;back in Vienna.&nbsp; They don't.&nbsp; 9 years later, and he's back in Paris.&nbsp; And there she is.&nbsp; The movie throws out all of this exposition in the first five minutes, for those of us who didn't see the first film.&nbsp; I didn't see the first film.&nbsp; A bunch of the reviews say seeing the first film makes this one even better.&nbsp; This one was pretty darn good anyway.&nbsp; It's 80 minutes of talk.&nbsp; They talk.&nbsp; And talk.&nbsp; But it's good talk.&nbsp; It draws you in.&nbsp; It makes you listen.&nbsp; It has depth, it has emotion, it has some meaning.&nbsp; It doesn't sound like movie dialogue.&nbsp; That's a compliment.&nbsp; It's talk that makes you think about yourself, and makes you care about the characters.&nbsp; For the most part.&nbsp; I found the talk about the meaning of&nbsp;their lives&nbsp;much more compelling than the talk about their sex lives, which could have been excised out without losing anything for all that I cared.&nbsp; I found the ending dragged a little bit.&nbsp; But those are quibbles.&nbsp; This is a good&nbsp;film.&nbsp; Well worth seeing.

       Are You Interviewing Soon?&nbsp; The Day-In-The-Life-Of-A-Summer-Associate MegaPost  &nbsp; Yesterday I posted some questions that 2Ls might&nbsp;consider when looking at law firms as they begin the&nbsp;job search&nbsp;process (it's not a terrible post; check it out directly below).&nbsp; But this morning I realize that I've gotten a step ahead of myself.&nbsp; I mean, how can someone think about questions before they even really know what people at law firms do.&nbsp; I had very little conception of the day-to-day of a summer associate's life before getting to the firm I'm at.&nbsp; And I probably haven't done a terrific job this summer of really painting a good picture of a typical day.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that a typical day here looks a lot like a typical day everywhere, so I feel like this might actually be useful.&nbsp; I'm aiming for useful rather than funny, but I will try to accomplish the Herculean task of being both.&nbsp; Thus: a typical day.  &nbsp;  1. I wake up at 7:20, which is too early.&nbsp; But I'm living at home, and I'm about an hour and ten minutes away on a typical day (a little bit less if I don't "just miss" a bus or a subway).&nbsp; For people who've never had a "real job" before, you won't appreciate the benefits of not having a long commute until it's too late and you've already plunked down $$$$ on a sublet in a "more fun" area of town, or a "gentrifying hamlet" across the river, or a "slum that someone described quite disingenuously on Craigslist."&nbsp; For people who've had real jobs before, you already know.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the fact that my rent is free makes the commute worth it, at least intellectually.&nbsp; And I've been able to get my Amazon wish list significantly reduced because of the awesome way that the New York Public Library can gather the books I request together and e-mail me when they're waiting for me, all at no charge.&nbsp; This library thing is pretty cool.&nbsp; I still don't understand why downloading music is bad, but libraries continue to be an acceptable way of reading other people's intellectual property for free.&nbsp; Is it because you have to return them?&nbsp; So 30-day mp3s with free renewal up to 5 times and the ability to borrow again and again would make the music industry happy?&nbsp; I suppose it's the scale -- the library needs to buy each book it lends -- but now with stuff like iTunes, could we have an iTunes library where only 1 person can take the song out for every copy the library buys?&nbsp; I've gotten off track here, and so quickly.&nbsp; In any event, I wake up at 7:20, and then waste 20 minutes setting my fantasy baseball lineups, checking e-mail, and seeing if anyone linked to my blog overnight.&nbsp; These are things I could wait to do at work and get 20 more minutes of sleep in the morning.&nbsp; But there's something about the more gradual ascent from sleep to shower to subway that feels better than jumping right from bed out the door.&nbsp; Other people press snooze; I press "Scott Hatteberg 1B/DH; Travis Hafner Bench."  &nbsp;  2. It's 8:50.&nbsp; I've completed the bus portion of my journey and I'm now leaning up against something filthy on the subway.&nbsp; There have been 4 days when I've gotten a seat.&nbsp; Either a Friday before a holiday weekend, or a day when I left later than I should.&nbsp; Every other day I lean against something filthy.&nbsp; A couple of times there have been no more things to lean against and I have to touch a subway pole.&nbsp; I've written articulately about subway poles before.&nbsp; Those especially interested can do a search.  &nbsp;  3. Sometime between 9:14 and 9:27, I arrive at work.&nbsp; We're supposed to be here at 9:30.&nbsp; This is as close as I can time it and still feel comfortable.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I'm in the mood, I stop at the&nbsp;Attorney Lounge on the way up and get a muffin (if there are any left).&nbsp; The bagels are more popular than the muffins, but I like the muffins better.&nbsp; Not all of the muffins.&nbsp; The banana walnut are pretty bad.&nbsp; The plain white ones are pretty bad too.&nbsp; The corn muffins are okay.&nbsp; The&nbsp;raisin bran with&nbsp;oats on top are probably the best.&nbsp; One day I put&nbsp;cream cheese on a muffin, in part because I wondered if it would be&nbsp;good, and in part because I was too&nbsp;sleepy to remember whether cream cheese goes on bagels or muffins.&nbsp; It doesn't go well on muffins.&nbsp; I don't recommend it.&nbsp; One&nbsp;day I stopped at a nearby&nbsp;baked goods emporium -- there are about 12 within a stone's throw; most are city-wide chains with impenetrable vaguely foreign names, like "Pax,"&nbsp;"Le French Breakfasterie," "Bulgarian Bagel Shop," "Europa Cafe," "Asiatic Cafe," "Arctic Cafe," "Authentic Tacos, Pizza, and Kung Pao Chicken," "Cosi," "Pan-Asian&nbsp;Fusion&nbsp;Kosher Delicatessen and Spa,"&nbsp;"Regurgitated&nbsp;Flour and Sugar," "Le CaffeineCaffeineCaffeine," and "Sewer Shack."&nbsp; Three of those are real.&nbsp; The rest are worthless filler.&nbsp; Sometimes, if I'm expecting a slow morning where the urge to go to the bathroom will be a welcomed distraction, I'll&nbsp;get some tea too.&nbsp; Sometimes I won't.&nbsp; I like to surprise myself.  &nbsp;  4. I arrive at my desk -- I share an office with another summer, which is nice.&nbsp; Some people share offices with first-year associates, which is probably also nice, but in different ways.&nbsp; Sharing an office with another summer means we can ask each other dumb questions about whether the blinking light on the phone means it needs maintenance, needs a new battery, or there's a voicemail message.&nbsp; Or what the energy bars in the emergency kit taste like.&nbsp; Or whether it's appropriate to ask our secretary to send&nbsp;something inter-office mail, or if that's something we should just figure out how to do ourselves.&nbsp; And it sort of means that if I have nothing to do, I don't have to feel like I need to pretend, just because there's a "real lawyer" in the office who might notice.&nbsp; But if I shared with an associate, there'd be someone to ask real questions to, about how to do actual lawyer stuff, and -- the real bonus -- someone to go to lunch with when other plans don't come to fruition.&nbsp; Because the real goal of the summer is to go to lunch.&nbsp; Not really.&nbsp; But it's in the top ten.  &nbsp;  5. I check my e-mail, voicemail, paper mail, and whether I've left anything on my desk with the intention of doing it this morning, but have forgotten about it sometime between leaving yesterday and arriving this morning.&nbsp; Like, "Why's this paper here?&nbsp; Oh, yeah, it's because I have to read it.&nbsp; I should do that."&nbsp; Papers on my desk right now: a phone extension without a label as to whose it is; three drafts of something I wrote last week; a sample form an associate gave me to look at; a fourth draft of the thing I wrote last week; an e-mail I printed; a mapquest map of somewhere I went last week; some handwritten notes from a conference call I sat in on; the name of an associate who wanted to know if I was free for lunch; my Lexis card with password on it; a petty cash voucher form for a $2.00 subway trip that I theoretically could get reimbursed for but don't really have the energy to figure out how reimbursements work just for $2.00. &nbsp; 6. So I'll either have an assignment I'm working on, or I'll have to check if someone has feedback on something I did and needs me to do more on it, or I'll e-mail someone and see if they have anything for me to do.&nbsp; At the firm I'm at, we're assigned to a couple of attorneys for two- or three-week cycles, so we can sample a bunch of different practice areas and work with a bunch of different people, but it's flexible enough that it's no problem to keep working on projects after one rotation is done, or to go back to people you were working with before and see if they have anything new for you to do if things are slow from the people you're assigned to.&nbsp; It's actually a loose enough system that you can make as much of the summer as you're motivated to, as far as trying out different work and different people -- you're not limited as far as where you can turn, but you're also always under some people's charge so you don't feel like you're totally on your own to find work.&nbsp; The flipside is that you sometimes need to make an effort to find work, and that different summers can have radically different amounts of work just depending on who they get assigned to and what projects come up.&nbsp; But I'm guessing that happens in most places, regardless of what the structure of the summer program is.&nbsp; During interviews, I heard from a lot of firms about whether you do rotations or you're assigned to specific groups, or it's a free for all -- the basic structure of the assignment system.&nbsp; But I'm realizing that the more important dimension is probably how rigid it is -- no matter what the baseline is, are you able to "contract out" by doing assignments in areas you want to try, and with people you want to work with.&nbsp; A system where we had to stop each project on the Friday our rotation ended, and couldn't do anything not assigned by the people&nbsp;assigned to us would feel different -- not necessarily in a bad way, if there was enough work being assigned by your people, and if you were assigned to divisions you like -- than a more flexible system.&nbsp; And the ability to change your preferences throughout the summer -- like, if you originally had to rank practice areas and were assigned to your top 3 for stints during the summer, but got to the firm and decided you don't like what you picked as #2 but want to try something else entirely, or you start doing #3 and realize you want to do more of it -- seems useful, because we know nothing coming in, and just being at a firm provides a lot more knowledge about what these people actually do in the different groups. &nbsp; 7. The assignments themselves.&nbsp; Actually this part's pretty much what you might expect before the summer.&nbsp; Researching on Lexis and Westlaw, writing up summaries of cases or memos or other big stacks of paper, reading through big documents looking for small stuff, helping to organize or arrange or manage big stacks of paper, filling out forms, checking rules and procedures, drafting e-mails, memos, perhaps some contractual language, drafting initial stabs at sections of a brief, sitting in on conference calls, going to hearings, tagging along in court, perhaps sitting in on a client meeting.&nbsp; That's basically the collection of tasks.&nbsp; Which seems a lot like what a first-year associate does.&nbsp; I suppose asking about guidance wouldn't be terrible -- but I think probably all firms know how much guidance summer associates need, and all are probably pretty good about not giving people stuff they can't handle, at least not without appropriate directions and starting points.&nbsp; The work itself has been appropriate to get a taste, but I wouldn't think it's something most people should be concerned about going in -- what they teach us in law school is enough to handle the stuff they want to throw at summer associates, at least from what I've seen.&nbsp; These firms know what they're doing in this arena -- there's nothing to be gained from giving out work people are ill-equipped to do. &nbsp; 8. After some work and some e-mail checking, it's time for lunch.&nbsp; I've already mined the summer lunch territory in previous posts.&nbsp; The days we don't go out to lunch, usually people give a talk over lunch about what they do and what their group at the firm does, and from talking to friends at other firms, that seems pretty standard.&nbsp; Sometimes hard to tell until you actually get an assignment from a group; and also, as much as they pretend otherwise, it seems like, on a broad scale, the work in one department is a lot like the work in every other.&nbsp; It doesn't seem like there's a tremendous amount of variation except for the general point that litigation is more Lexis research and brief writing, and corporate/transactional is more contract reading and contract writing. &nbsp; 9. Afternoon, same as the morning, basically.&nbsp; Some more work. I'm running out of steam on this post.&nbsp; I think firms do differ on how many hours they expect a summer to be at work.&nbsp; I have friends who stay pretty late.&nbsp; That's something to ask about, but perhaps not until offer is in hand.&nbsp; And maybe you want to be busy enough to have to stay late, I don't know.&nbsp; Some people do.&nbsp; Some projects require people to stay late.&nbsp; Whether you stay late may be a combination of&nbsp;a crapshoot and your own work habits and style.&nbsp; Just like there are people at law school who study more than they need to and are always in the library, there will probably be people at your firm who make things take longer than they need to and stay late for reasons that may not be apparent to people who do things differently.&nbsp; Everyone works differently and gets differently stressed about stuff.&nbsp; It's not all that dissimilar from school in this sense.&nbsp; I get the sense firms are not dying to make you stay later than you need to. &nbsp; 10. And one or two nights a week, the day finishes with some sort of summer associate event -- territory, once again, I've mined before.&nbsp; We've had the same mix of stuff as our peer firms, often at the same time -- bowling, scavenger hunt, culinary class, Broadway show, concert, etc.&nbsp; It's fun, and usually comes with lots of food.&nbsp; It's nice because it makes the summer feel like summer camp and not just work, and helps you get to know your fellow summer associates.&nbsp; Okay, certainly the humor has petered out at this point in the post, and I don't know that I have any more to say&nbsp;under the "day in the life" backdrop, at least not right now, so I think I'll end it here.&nbsp; Phew.&nbsp; Hope someone found this helpful.

      A friend of mine, who's going to&nbsp;be a 2L pretty soon, e-mailed to ask me if I had any advice about New York firms and the interview process, or anything like that.&nbsp; As I wrote back a reply about seventeen times longer than I'm sure he wants to read, I found myself thinking about issues that hadn't really crossed my mind when I was interviewing, but that, having experienced 10 weeks of summer work so far, might have been things to think about during the process, just issues I didn't realize might matter.&nbsp; These thoughts don't reflect much about my summer -- it's just things that I'd probably be more curious about during the interview process now than I was before, just because I have a better sense of the terrain.&nbsp; &nbsp; a.&nbsp; Size may matter.&nbsp; I don't know what the differences are between larger firms and smaller firms.&nbsp; I'm at a larger firm.&nbsp; It probably wouldn't have been a bad idea to ask a smaller firm what makes them different from a larger firm -- is the work different -- does it get more substantive more quickly, or does a smaller firm just have fewer clients, and so the work is really pretty much the same at the junior levels?&nbsp; Are there culture differences when there are fewer people, like how smaller universities can have a greater feeling of community than a larger one, or is the larger firm broken up in such a way that you work within a smaller community, and so there's really no difference?&nbsp; Are the clients, and thus the complexity and interest level of the work, different?&nbsp; Is the summer program itself a different sort of experience?&nbsp; These are questions that may not matter, and that I don't have answers to.&nbsp; But they might be things someone might consider. &nbsp; b. Workflow.&nbsp; I notice at my firm that people are busy for a while, and then less busy for a while.&nbsp; This may be the nature of the practice, at all firms.&nbsp; This may be something that people like more than always being medium-busy, or it may be something people don't like.&nbsp; I don't know if it's different elsewhere.&nbsp; So it may not be bad to ask whether there are systems in place to manage workflow, to ease the ebb and flow so it isn't a month with nothing and then a month with 20-hour days, or maybe you like it that way, and so you want to make sure there aren't systems that try to compensate for that. &nbsp; c. It might be a&nbsp;good idea, before accepting an offer,&nbsp;to talk to associates who came from other firms, and how the new firm compares to the old one, why they left, what's different.&nbsp; Maybe these are conversations after you get an offer -- but I don't know that I really appreciated that there are differences between firms, in terms of culture and work, that are very hard to discern during the interview process, but probably pretty obvious to people actually working there, especially people who've worked elsewhere. &nbsp; d. I&nbsp;might think about asking how closely new associates get to work with partners, or if there are lots of layers in between -- again, this can cut both ways -- fewer layers may mean a system that's very scary for beginners, but also may mean more substantive work more quickly.&nbsp; I'm not sure.&nbsp; But it's something I didn't really think about.&nbsp;  &nbsp; e. I would look at diversity on a broad spectrum.&nbsp; Are there lawyers from different backgrounds, from different schools, with different interests, with different experiences -- in other words, are there people you can identify with, and feel some sort of sense that if this situation works for them, there's a good chance it'll work for me.&nbsp; And maybe diversity is the wrong word to capture this -- affinity, perhaps.&nbsp; Are there people like you, and do they like it?&nbsp; Or is everyone there who seems to like it there very different from you, and so maybe you can't necessarily rely on their feelings mirroring yours.&nbsp;  &nbsp; f.&nbsp;Facetime and what it means at the firm.&nbsp; Do people leave early if they have no work, and can early mean something earlier than midnight&nbsp;-- if so, that can probably make the long days better, knowing that short ones are at least possible. &nbsp; g. I'd probably ask how often people work weekends, or perhaps work from home on the weekends instead of coming into the office.&nbsp; It seems like a lot of people at a lot of firms work to some degree on some weekends.&nbsp; But the "some" is vague.&nbsp; Again, I don't know if there are differences between firms.&nbsp; There might be. &nbsp; h. I'd ask about turnover rate.&nbsp; I don't know what the average is, but I imagine someone does, and I imagine it's not a bad way to get a broad vision of satisfaction at the firm.&nbsp; I admit that I don't know the turnover rate where I am, and I don't know what the industry average is, but it does seem like, at least when making interview decisions, this might be a really nice set of numbers to have. &nbsp; Hopefully this was useful to someone.&nbsp; I'll have more thoughts on the interview process in the coming weeks -- but if anyone has any questions, shoot me an e-mail; the questions may lead me to think of some stuff&nbsp;that wouldn't otherwise cross my mind.

      Hey, a shot in the dark here, I'm looking for recommendations on laptops,&nbsp;or any I should stay away from.&nbsp; I'm looking for something pretty simple --&nbsp;for taking notes at school, using the Internet, probably a CD burner and a&nbsp;quality sound card -- but I don't care&nbsp;how big the screen is or about anything with an abbreviation -- RAM, ROM, HDTV, PCP, anything like that.&nbsp; Just something that works.&nbsp; So&nbsp;if anyone&nbsp;has any nice (or terrible) things to say about relatively cheap, but&nbsp;not crappy, laptops, let me know.&nbsp; Anyone who&nbsp;knows&nbsp;cheap places to look, or&nbsp;works for Dell and&nbsp;can get me 30% off&nbsp;-- your&nbsp;e-mails are also welcomed.&nbsp; (I've already looked at the Harvard discount laptop purchase page, which&nbsp;didn't seem like it was discounted much.&nbsp; Way out of my league.)&nbsp;

      OK, so last night I wrote about the Dylan Moran one-man show I saw on Wednesday night, and that the one piece of his routine that stuck in my head on the way out&nbsp;was that&nbsp;he talked about&nbsp;life&nbsp;as basically a journey to find people who understand how you think.&nbsp; Which I thought was interesting.&nbsp; I'm going to ramble on this point for a bit without any real destination, so we'll see where I end up.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; Having something happen and then knowing that there's someone around that you can make eye contact with and know that they're thinking what you're thinking is nice.&nbsp; It's comforting.&nbsp; It makes me feel like I'm not insane; that maybe whatever's inside my head isn't crazy.&nbsp; So that connection is good.&nbsp; But I have a lot of friends where that isn't the case, at least not that often as far as I can tell, and that doesn't make them lesser friends, or mean I&nbsp;like being around them any less.&nbsp; Because sometimes you're compatible even if you don't necessarily understand how the other person thinks -- or not "even if" but perhaps "because" you don't understand how they think, so they're interesting in a way.&nbsp; Because you're not sure what they're thinking, and you're not sure how they're processing the thing that you're processing.&nbsp; But frustrating sometimes.&nbsp; Like, to give a relatively mundane example -- but it's the one that's coming to mind -- I had a conversation with a friend a few weeks ago about being on time vs. being late.&nbsp; I'm generally on time -- more than most people, I think.&nbsp; I don't like being late, feeling like I'm going to be late, feeling like I'm keeping people waiting.&nbsp; In a way, it's because I spend more mental energy than I should trying to make sure people like me, and if I'm late that's a reason not to like me, and that's fully in my control, and I'd rather be someone people can count on to be on time than someone people know is always late, because that feels like a better thing to be.&nbsp; So I tend to leave early to get places, overestimate the time it'll take me, plan for possibilities that won't happen... so I'm not late very often, and when I am I usually have a totally legitimate and understandable reason, like the express train exploded or I got stuck in a meat grinder (huh?&nbsp; I don't know where the words come from, sorry).&nbsp; And the friend I was talking to said that he comes at it from the opposite direction.&nbsp; He doesn't want to be late, but he always feels like something will take the shortest amount of&nbsp;time it has ever taken, and so it's reasonable&nbsp;for him to budget that amount of time -- and then something will come up right when he's getting ready to leave -- so he ends up late.&nbsp; Not on purpose, but just because it happens.&nbsp; Which is different from what&nbsp;happens to me, obviously.&nbsp; And probably his way is better, because although it bothers me when someone is late, I chalk it up to "this&nbsp;bothers me more than it bothers other people" and don't actually hold it against them, unless they're consistently&nbsp;really late, and for no good reason.&nbsp; Or don't call to say they're going to be late.&nbsp; Or are&nbsp;just flaky about making plans in general, which, again, probably bothers me more than it&nbsp;bothers other people, but&nbsp;as long as someone is predictable -- if I *know* you always cancel plans, then I can plan for you to cancel and be happy when you don't&nbsp;and&nbsp;it's all fine, I understand, it's just how you work.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now&nbsp;where was I going with this?&nbsp; I don't know.&nbsp; Thinking differently.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think this was a bad example of where I was going, but it's a lot of words so I'm going to leave it.&nbsp; I guess what I want to write is that I sort of agree with Moran's point, and it is really nice to find people who understand how you think, and you understand how they think, so you can realize you're not insane and feel like you're not all alone in this big, dark world.&nbsp; Okay, this was useless, and I'v e just written a lot of words about absolutely nothing, so I think I'll stop.&nbsp; This is what happens when I'm sitting at a desk too long.&nbsp; :)

      Tonight, we had a summer associate trip to see Elvis Costello perform at Lincoln Center.&nbsp; While I'd heard of Elvis Costello, I couldn't have named a single song of his.&nbsp; After seeing him perform, I realize why.&nbsp; He writes extraordinarily unmemorable songs.&nbsp; That's not to say I didn't enjoy it, or that I don't think he's quite talented.&nbsp; I enjoyed a lot of what he sang -- although the volume was way too loud (that could be because we were sitting pretty close) and so the actual words were really hard to decipher -- but can't remember a single tune.&nbsp; He writes over chords, and simply doesn't have linear melody lines that are hummable and memorable.&nbsp; And, he destroys any chance at remembering the songs by drowning his melodies in a wall of sound, the guitar jangle obscuring anything else, such that each up-tempo song is just non-stop jangle and they all sound the same -- and&nbsp;the slower songs&nbsp;get pretty dull.&nbsp; And, he doesn't let his songs breathe.&nbsp; It's non-stop words, no clear verse/chorus/verse pattern, no clear 8-bar phrasing... so it's hard to even understand where you are in a song.&nbsp; Which all combines to make it -- to me, and I respect that minds can surely differ about this sort of stuff -- not at all unpleasant, but just not memorable at all, and not something I have much interest in hearing again.&nbsp; Sorry, Elvis.&nbsp; I'm not joining the fan club.  &nbsp;  But that's just the opening act for the rest of this post.&nbsp; Last night, I went to see the off-Broadway show "Monster" starring Dylan Moran.&nbsp; Moran is a comedian from the UK.&nbsp; His show, which is playing just through Saturday, I think, is basically 90 minutes of intelligent stand-up comedy.&nbsp; Well, almost.&nbsp; I actually really enjoyed it, and I don't tend to really enjoy all that much stuff I go see, so this was a pleasant surprise.&nbsp; 7.75 on a scale of 1-10.&nbsp; I laughed out loud a few times, felt amused most of the time besides, and only zoned out once and started thinking about how I have no lunch plans for Friday with associates, and probably everyone else already does.&nbsp; Anyway, about 65% of Moran's material seemed fresh and was engaging and even thought-provoking at times.&nbsp; The other 35% was standard stand-up comedian shlock, including a bit about America's fetish with children that I think he may have stolen from George Carlin.&nbsp; If you're going to steal, Carlin's a great one to steal from.&nbsp; But that 35% that didn't work for me ought to be cut, replaced with stuff more like the 65% that worked, and Bingo, great show.&nbsp; I totally recommend this show if you're looking for something to do in Manhattan Friday or Saturday night.&nbsp; The Village Theater, 158 Bleecker Street.  &nbsp;  The one piece of his routine that stuck in my head on the way out -- he talked about&nbsp;life&nbsp;as basically a journey to find people who understand how you think.&nbsp; I think I have things to say about that.&nbsp; A broader discussion.&nbsp; But I will save it for tomorrow, since I have to sleep.  &nbsp;  Just&nbsp;a couple of notes on books I've read since the last update, though:  &nbsp;  >>The Working Poor, by&nbsp;David Shipler.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's a book about people on the fringe of poverty.&nbsp; There was a NY Times Magazine excerpt from the book a while back, about a woman who works in Wal-Mart and has no teeth.&nbsp; If you read that and liked it you'll like the book.&nbsp; If you didn't, you won't.&nbsp; I thought it was okay but nothing special.&nbsp; So this&nbsp;is all the space I'll give it.  &nbsp;  >>Blindsided, by Richard Cohen.&nbsp; Cohen's wife is Meredith Vieira from The View.&nbsp; Cohen&nbsp;was a TV news producer, got&nbsp;multiple sclerosis, and got colon cancer -- this is a book about coping with serious illness but trying to live lief anyway.&nbsp; It's very personal, it's very engaging -- it's a little graphic at times regarding colon stuff, so&nbsp;the best place to read it may be on the toilet.&nbsp; It's a fine book.&nbsp;&nbsp;You're not missing anything if you don't read it, but if you're still reading this paragraph, you might like the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;

      I went to an Antitrust Law Seminar today.  Actually, let me just pull some language from the invite to be more precise about it:  "For some years the Antitrust Section of the New York State Bar Association ("NYSBA") has presented a summer program for law students who are interested in the practice of antitrust law and who are working in the New York City area in the summer."  My firm had sent the invite along to the summer associates; many other firms did the same.  I'm marginally curious about antitrust law; the thought of a little field trip and a change of scenery perhaps was also a factor.  So that was from 9-11 this morning.  The session was in another firm's cafeteria.  The tables had little table tents advertising a summer of pork, or some promotion like that.  Pictures of truly grotesque looking food that made me very glad that my firm doesn't have a cafeteria.  This cafeteria was actually run by the same people who do dining services at the law school; another reason to be very, very thankful my firm doesn't have a cafeteria.  It's weird, because before the summer I would have said that a cafeteria is a plus -- now I would definitely say it's a minus.  You don't really want to be stuck in the building all day.  You want to get out, even if it's not for a "summer associate lunch" but just for something quick and cheap.  You want the break.  Especially as a summer associate, when what you're doing really isn't uber-critical.  So if you're thinking how I was, that a cafeteria at the firm would be kind of cool because you'd always have people to eat with and wouldn't have to go find something every day -- take my thoughts under advisement.  I think you'll be glad you don't have a cafeteria.  Trust me on this one.  The session also featured marginally decent crumb cake and completely inedible scone-like bricks which could have done some damage if thrown at the speakers.  I couldn't see the speakers because there was a big column in my way.  I guess I could have moved.  I guess.  A significant fraction of people were taking notes.  I took very brief notes, but only to facilitate the writing of this post.  Here are my notes, along with the explanation for why I wrote them:  "Like it... boss is here" -- the first speaker said she's liked her time at the firm so far... and mentioned that her boss was right there.  So her statement was obviously 100% credible.  :)  I don't mean to say she doesn't like her job -- how do I know whether she likes her job -- just that it's not like there was anything else she was going to say.  "Antitrust is antitrust" -- I think that was from someone saying that it didn't matter where you did antitrust work, but that antitrust is antitrust wherever you do it.  Clearly this was a helpful comment.  "Work is work" -- thanks, but what is it exactly that you *do*?  "Antitrust monthly" -- one guy said antitrust is relatively academic and that you can publish a lot, in places like "Antitrust monthly," "Antitrust magazine," "Antitrust reports," [please assume my quotes are invented from this point on in the paragraph] "Antitrust weekly," "Antitrust daily," "Antitrust hourly," "The Journal of Antitrust," "Antitrust Review of Books," "Antitrust Gone Wild," "The Antitruster," "U.S. News and Antitrust Report," "Antitrust Illustrated," "Antitrust & Stream," "Antitrusteur," "Mother Antitrust," "The Antitrust Reader," "Antitrust Digest," "PlayAntitrust," "Rolling Antitrust Stone," "Antitrust Aficionado," "Antitrust for Kids," "3-2-1 Antitrust," "Archie, Veronica, and Antitrust," "Mad (about Antitrust)," "The Antitrust Lampoon," "Everything you ever wanted to know about Antitrust but were afraid to ask," "The New Republic of Antitrust," "Antitrust Travel & Antitrust Leisure," "A: The Antitrust Magazine," "Martha Antitrust Living," "AntitrustStyle," "Better Homes and Antitrust," "Mother's Antitrust," "Men's Antitrust Health," "Vanity Antitrust Fair," and "TV Antitrust Crosswords."  Phew.  OK, now that I've run that joke into the ground...

      The All-Star Game is overproduced.  How about some more sound effects, FOX? What about a camera in the ball itself?  That'll be fun!  So what if everyone throws up?  Let's mic former President Bush, sitting in the first row, visible on every pitch, but not mentioned until the 4th inning.  Or how about showing some computer-generated fireworks every few minutes?  Or "Skippy" or "Snappy" or whatever the animation's name was showing us how to throw a slider?  What about some graphics about all the players' favorite breakfast cereals?  How about airing the game in 3-D?  Or HD?  Or as an MTV music video?  I don't understand.  Just show the game.  Relax with the special effects.

      Whenever someone leaves the firm, they send a Departure memo to everyone in the office, thanking people who they've worked with, providing contact information, etc.  But why save them just for when you're leaving for good?   TO: All Personnel RE: Goodbye (for the day)   I am leaving the office at 5:30 today, with great sadness, for an opportunity to spend some extended time with my family until returning tomorrow morning.  Before I leave, I would like to thank a number of people for helping to make my time in the office today pleasant and rewarding: thanks to Bob for the guidance and support, John for taking me out to lunch, Sheila for holding the elevator for me, and Herb for cleaning the office.  Thanks to Joe for making sure the photocopier did not run out of paper; thanks to Lauren for all of the good times; thanks to James for helping me through the rough spot around 2:00 when I couldn't find my keys.  It would be impossible for me to recall everyone I've worked with today, but I hope you all know how much I've appreciated the opportunity and chance to continue my legal career with such wonderful people.  I will miss you all, during my commute home, as well as when I get there, and I will keep you all in mind until I return.  Please stay in touch.  You can reach me by e-mail, although probably not until after 7:00; of course my cell phone will be with me at all times.  I hope to remain in contact with all of you; you are my lighthouse in the storm.  I regret not having the chance to contribute more to the team during my time here today; if only I had taken ten more minutes to read the document this morning; if only I hadn't missed the light coming back from lunch -- the regrets are virtually endless.  But I will treasure the time I spent -- in my office, in the lobby, in the bathroom, and the many other paths I've crossed from this morning until now.  At the risk of leaving out something I will regret, I want to bring this note to an end with a wish that every job could be as fulfilling as mine has been, today, and share with you the feeling that my heart beats more strongly and my soul shines brighter because of these 8 hours we've spent together.  Do not hesitate to let me know if there is ever anything I can do for you, at least until the morning.  Also note that I will be unavailable this evening between 7 and 7:20 due to an appointment for a haircut.  Callers during that time will be able to leave a voice mail, and I will return those messages as soon as I am able.  This brief vacation from electronic communication will allow my spirits to rejuvenate before taking on the next set of challenges that my life has to offer.  Cheers, and Best Wishes, Jeremy

      Here's a sketch based on an idea I pondered a while ago.  My execution could be better, but what can I do.  (OPEN ON: VH1 video opening to I Love the 80s, altered to read, I Love the 1820s and a montage of clips)  ANNOUNCER From the Missouri Compromise to the invention of the Electromagnet to making your own food, VH1 presents I Love the 1820s.  STAND-UP COMEDIAN Im your host, a stand-up comedian no ones ever heard of.  Remember where you were when you heard that the whaling ship Essex was rammed and sunk by a sperm whale in the Pacific Ocean?   ANNOUNCER (over a video re-enactment of a whale ramming a ship) It was November 20, 1820, and the Essex was on the sea, looking for whales.  Suddenly, the crew felt the boat shake.  For 94 days, the survivors clung to life, turning to cannibalism when they ran out of food.  MANDY MOORE I think I was getting my nails done when that happened.  HORATIO SANZ Man, I cried myself to sleep that night.  Dude.  STAND-UP COMEDIAN We all remember hearing the terrible news that Daniel Boone had died at the age of 85.  HORATIO SANZ Daniel Boone was da man.  MC HAMMER Daniel Boone.  Man, I miss that fellow.  ANNOUNCER Can you imagine life without a lawnmower?  Neither could Edwin Budding of Massachusetts.  STAND-UP COMEDIAN The lawnmower was originally designed to cut the nap from cotton cloth.  I dont know about you, but *I* could sure use a nap.  MANDY MOORE I love mowing lawns.  HORATIO SANZ Lawnmower, man.  Wow, lawnmowers.  Dude.  ANNOUNCER And in politics, Congress made the trade of foreign slaves an act of piracy.  MANDY MOORE Go get em, Congress!  STAND-UP COMEDIAN Thats all the time we have tonight on VH1s I Love the 1820s.  Tune in next week for the accurate calculation of the diameter of the Earth, the life of Euclid, and Rome conquering Spain, on VH1s I Love the 3rd Century B.C.!

       Books & Movies Update   I saw "Control Room" last week, which is a documentary about Al Jazeera television and how it compares with U.S. media coverage of the war in Iraq.  It's basically a behind-the-scenes at the media coverage of the war, spending a lot of time in Al Jazeera's newsroom and at press conferences.  Very interesting, very worthwhile, compelling stuff -- certainly anyone interested in the war or the media in general (and not even necessarily both) will find it fascinating.  The  urlLink Boston Globe  has a pretty solid review.   urlLink Roger Ebert 's take is similar.  Check 'em out if you're on the fence; I actually think I probably got more out of this film than Fahrenheit 9/11, since this one just feels more true and not as driven by an agenda.  Not that Fahrenheit 9/11 wasn't entertaining; but, like I said after I saw it, it's just hard to know what's real fact and what's manipulated fact.  On the bus to and from the firm's vineyard tour on Saturday, I read Richard Yancey's "Confessions of a Tax Collector," which is a memoir of a few years the author spent as a "Revenue Officer" for the IRS, going after people who didn't pay their taxes.  You will learn very little about taxes from this book, so don't read it for that.  No tax secrets.  Because the book is really about a frustrating job with frustrating co-workers, and coping with a life that gets consumed by that job, and the hours and stress it entails.  It's relevant for a much wider circle than just tax collectors, and that's both its primary strength and its primary weakness, I think.  It's a strength because he makes it easy to relate -- you can imagine co-workers like his in any office, in any setting; you can imagine the struggles of work-life balance, of figuring out how to cope, of dealing with the day-to-day of what he describes as a pretty dismal, horrible lifestyle and job.  Although he stays for a dozen years.  And here's the weakness: I don't care.  I don't have any intrinsic interest in what an IRS Revenue Officer does, he overkills the book with acronyms and descriptions of forms and procedures that don't matter and that really don't enlighten us as to much.  It seems like he failed to realize that his book wasn't really about the IRS, but that his experiences were just a platform for some broader commentary on jobs and lives and coping and figuring out your path.  But he never leaps off the platform and takes the reader anywhere rewarding.  I found myself waiting for the introspective leap -- waiting for the broader themes to come in, waiting for some discussion of society, and what it says about society that this job exists, that these people exist, that this is his life.  But he doesn't go there.  And, his book is filled with unlikeable characters, people who sound dreadful to be around.  Including him.  He takes the reader to an unpleasant world, and leaves us there to languish in the details for 300 pages.  Did I finish the book?  Yeah, so I really can't attack it too much.  But I was waiting for more insight, a payoff, a reason to stay engaged.  And it never came.  There's some interesting stuff inside, some passages you'll read and realize they can apply to all sorts of situations; and there's an element of curiosity satisfied about what an IRS Revenue Officer does -- but unless this really gets you excited, I'm not sure I recommend.  Also last week, I read "Are You Really Going To Eat That?" a collection of food writing by Robb Walsh, a former columnist for a bunch of in-flight airline magazines, the Austin Chronicle, and some other publications.  It surprised me that airline magazines would hire someone this good.  The essays are very readable, very satisfying.  They're all pretty short, so the book moves fast and you don't get bogged down; some of them even made me wish for more detail.  They do all sort of blend together at some point though.  The book is subtitled, "Reflections of a Culinary Thrill Seeker," and the book does contain its share of essays about food on the edge -- exotic shellfish and game, things you won't find in a normal supermarket.  But that's part of what makes it interesting.  It's solid food writing, so if that stuff tends to grab you, it's a good read.  Like most food writing, though, it does lack that feeling of relevance -- you're not missing anything if you *don't* read this book.  But it was a solid commute read.

      The Major League Baseball All-Star Game is this Tuesday.  To make the game more fun, allow me to present:   The All-Star Game Drinking Game   One drink for every time a new player enters the game.  One drink for every time a product is mentioned as the official [whatever] of Major League Baseball (e.g. "Depends is the official adult undergarment of Major League Baseball.")  One drink for every human interest clip of a first-time All-Star walking around with a digital camera recording every moment of this "once in a lifetime magical experience."  Another drink if they show his wife and kids.  A third drink if they show his parents.  One drink for every time they show a child in the crowd eating cotton candy, waving a foam finger, or sleeping on his father's lap.  Another drink if it's twins.  A third drink if they're wearing matching baseball-themed outfits.  A fourth drink if they're vomiting.  Two drinks for every time the announcers mention another record Barry Bonds has recently broken.  Two drinks for every time they show a replay of Derek Jeter diving headfirst into the stands to catch a foul ball.  Two drinks for every Mastercard "Priceless" commercial.  Two drinks for every time Tim McCarver makes a highbrow literary reference the other announcers don't understand.  Two drinks for every inarticulate interview clip where a player says something about being "honored to represent his country in the All-Star Game."  Two more drinks if they wave a miniature flag while they say it.  Three drinks for every time Roger Clemens throws something at Mike Piazza within the context of the game (e.g. the ball, when he's pitching)  Four drinks for every time Roger Clemens throws something at Mike Piazza outside the context of the game (e.g. the watercooler)  Five drinks for every time the Commissioner calls the game a tie and ends it because he's worried that there aren't enough pitchers left.

      I went to the Yankees game with some friends today.  It was a lot of fun.  The game, despite the lopsided 10-3 score (the Yankees won) was pretty close up until the end, there were a lot of home runs, some good pitching, the major league debut of a Yankees reliever, and the seats were in the shade, so it wasn't brutally hot.  There's a point in between innings when the Yankee scoreboard flashes messages sent in by spectators -- "Congratulations on your graduation, Charlie.  Love Mom and Dad."  "Welcome to your first Yankee game, Billy, age 3."  "Happy Anniversary Sheila."  "Jane, will you marry me, Love Pete."  And so on.  I wonder how much censorship goes on -- how many messages they reject each day.  Like, I wonder if any of these would get through:  *Harry, Sorry I killed your dog. *Welcome, Jessica, to the first game since your nervous breakdown. *I hope your tapeworm goes away. *Barbara, Hope your fertility treatment is successful. *Good luck in prison, Joe! *Bob, Glad you decided to come to the game with me instead of going to your brother's funeral.  From, Sam. *Wanda, sorry I raped you, Love Tim. *Let's Go Mets!

      It's actually about 1:45 on Sunday morning (Saturday night) but I'm back-dating because no one really reads this between midnight and 2 a.m. on Saturday night, plus I'm admitting what I'm doing, so I figure it's excusable.  We had an all-day law firm social event that involved a wine tasting and a vineyard and then a hanging out / eating lots of food afternoon and evening.  Discoveries:  1. There is this weird thing called "ice wine," made out of frozen grapes, that has the consistency of maple syrup and tastes really, really terrible.  Even if someone charges like $35 for a bottle of it.  I don't drink very much at all, so maybe I'm just missing the point of this thing.  But I really just didn't get it.  2. There are lots of ways to grow grapes.  They showed us 8 different ways.  You don't want more details than that, trust me.  Although if you're having trouble sleeping....  3. Sunscreen: good invention.  I'm glad I remembered to bring it.  4. Water: good invention.  Although it makes you pee a lot.  5. Food: good invention.  Although sometimes enough is enough and it just gets silly.  6. There is a company called "Rent A Tent" and they do exactly what it sounds like.  Do people grow up dreaming of being in the tent rental business?  7. Glassware + Pool = Broken Glass + Bare Feet.  Just a cautionary note.  I actually don't think there were any incidents.  But I could imagine one.  8. "Rent A Tent."  Really.  I can't get over that one.

       An open letter from a Lexis Rep to the Director of a Law Firm Summer Program   To Whom It May Concern:  For over 40 years I've been working at the Lexis family of companies, moving up from an entry-level job inserting the asterisk page numbers into cases, to Assistant Shepardizer, to Managing Director of Elaborate Pricing Schemes, to my current post as Vice President of Our Silly Competition With Westlaw.  In all of my years, I have never seen such irresponsible Lexis usage as that which has been perpetrated by the summer associates at your firm.  138 F.2d 651.  Your summer associates have searched in databases too large, databases too small, inappropriate circuits, irrelevant secondary sources, and bizarre periodicals in their search for the timely legal knowledge a skilled Lexis user can locate -- and it ought to shame you that nothing has been done to address the problem.  75 U.S. 451.  One summer associate, who shall remain nameless (but see 1P4R88B), was looking for cases where motions to dismiss were denied in the Third Circuit.  He selected the database for All Cases, and searched for "motions to dismis."  First of all, the database was too big, costing your client an extra $0.14.  Second, he spelled dismiss incorrectly.  Third, he used quotation marks.  Everyone who wasn't dropped on his head as a child knows that you don't use quotation marks in Lexis.  You use them in our evil nemesis who shall actually remain nameless.  We at Lexis are too good for quotation marks.  We hate quotation marks.  Quotation marks, die, and never show your evil two-pronged faces again.  You are the devil come to life.  Much like another associate at your firm, who double clicked on the search button, COSTING YOUR CLIENT FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TWENTY-SEVEN CENTS!  You don't double click in Lexis.  One click is more than sufficient to release the power of the world's foremost legal database.  How dare you doubt us and click twice.  We are working.  We are searching.  We are processing.  We do not need your extra click to spur us to action.  We are already there.  We are all-powerful.  We are almighty.  We are Lexis, KING of legal research.  I must go roll in piles of money now.  But I wanted to alert you to the impending doom you face if you do not address these critical malfunctions among your despicably incompetent summer class.  Long live Lexis.  Long live Mr. Shepard, who tirelessly tracks all of the cases cited by future cases.  Long live Mr. History, who tirelessly tracks all of the searches you do.  Long live Matthew Bender, who writes treatises that we pay to syndicate.  Long live our good friends at Nexis.  And long live you, but not your insipid summer associates.

The winner gets to blog with us for the rest of the summer (no cash, sorry).  We have a bunch of contestants, and perhaps we'll have them do some cool stuff.  I don't know.  We're figuring it out on the fly.  But check it out if you like.

      This morning on my commute I began to read Stephen Glass's novel, The Fabulist.  Stephen Glass, as you may recall, is the subject of the excellent, excellent movie "Shattered Glass" -- the writer for The New Republic who made up a whole bunch of stories from whole cloth, and, whoops, after way too long not getting caught, finally got caught.  (And went to law school, but that's a discussion for another day.)  The book, which came out a little more than a year ago -- 5 years after he got caught -- is billed as a novel inspired by what really happened to him; the reviews of the book (uniformly quite unfavorable) insist it's basically a memoir with the names changed (nonfiction as fiction, instead of his problem before -- fiction as nonfiction), and the characterizations played up so as to make him look less bad and the people around him less good.  Which is how it reads.  I've been wanting to read it, because I found the movie tremendously compelling, and, honestly, although it sounds bad to say this, I can see what his temptation was.  I'm sure most writers can -- the story would be so much better with that perfect detail, that perfect quote, that perfect character... all the way up to the story would be so much better if it was a completely different story than the one that really happened, but instead was the one in my head.  But I'm not completely sure how someone could have the lack of conscience to actually write the fake story and submit it for publication -- and to forge documents and subvert the fact-checking and build up a web of lies to support the fake story -- and to continue to ratchet up the stakes from a fake quote to articles that were completely untrue in every respect.    And perhaps that's where the difference is -- most of us can imagine the temptation; few of us can actually imagine doing it; and even fewer of those people would go beyond imagining to actually do what he did.  I mean, when I think about what he did, my closest parallel is that for my senior thesis in college, I came up with some words I thought would look nice in a quote, and then did a Lexis search to find if there was anything that fit -- reverse engineering, I guess -- and actually found something pretty close, and completely relevant, that I could cite.  But even though that seems sort of improperly reasoned -- motivated badly, by the desire to find the quote instead of working in the other direction -- I'm pretty sure that's not even on the same slippery slope as what Glass did, and pretty much what I've discovered Lexis research is all about, actually.  But where I'm going with this post is that I wanted to read the book to learn more about what was going on in his head, and also about life as a writer at The New Republic, and what his world looked like, as compared with the world the movie created.  And while I'm getting through the book with much less difficulty than the reviews indicated I might -- one reviewer I read said that he can't imagine anyone who wasn't involved in the situation actually being motivated to read the whole book -- there's not so much introspection going on, and, since the book starts as Glass is getting caught, not so much inside-The-New-Republic stuff going on.  But there is one passage, all the way on page 141, that I found myself reading over a second time, and I wanted to flag.  It's from a fictional phone conversation with his best friend from work, a week after Glass gets fired -- I know it's fictional because the real character it's based on wrote a review of the book, and insisted in the review that the call never happened.  But, more than anything else in the book up to this point (I'm up to page 196 out of 339), it's some interesting emotional content to ponder.  I'm quoting extensively here; hoping I'm not breaking any copyright laws:   Two years ago, Brian's car had broken down near York, Pennsylvania, around midnight, the night before his article was due....  [E]ven though he didn't ask me to, I drove up to York [from Washington] that night, arriving after 3 a.m., and brought Brian home.   He finished the piece and it ran in the magazine after all.  "At the time, I thought, Holy [], what an amazing friend," Brian explained.  "I wouldn't have driven that far. that late, for  anyone .  But after you did that for me, I absolutely would have done the same for you.  Hell, I would have driven to Alaska for you.  It was like some kind of logic game.  You took the first step, and proved to me you would be my great friend, and after that I would have been happy to repay you tenfold.  "But, Steve, you never called in the debt.... You never asked any of us for favors.  Which is really strange, since you were always doing them for us.  "Steve, you do favors people don't even ask for.  You noticed what we liked to eat, what we liked to read--then you'd always get it for us....   "I now realize why you do all these favors. It's because you're asking for a favor every day--your own kind of favor.  You ask for our trust and approval and kindness and love.  That's what you want.  You want the things we give away for free.  But that's not friendship, that's buying us." Now, maybe he writes this to paint Brian in a bad light, like he's turning Steve's friendship into something sinister.  But the passage got me thinking a little bit.  We all want people's trust and approval and kindness and love.  Or do we?  I do.  But maybe other people don't?  But if I feel a little like this guy who's making up magazine stories so people like him... does that make me capable of bad stuff like that too?  And maybe this is the kind of thinking he wants people to engage in, so they get a better sense of how he could do this.  Or maybe I shouldn't care if people like me.  Anyway, the passage was thought-provoking.  Enough that I felt like typing it to share.  Interesting book, if you liked the movie.  I don't feel as terrible about the book as the reviews did.  (Then again, I got it for free from the library.)

      E-mail from Tax Professor:   Model exams for the Spring, 2004 Taxation B final course are now available for your review on Blackboard. These were two different, but very good exams, only slightly edited... Nope, not really tempted to go check those out.  I wish I was.  Sort of.  But I don't even remember the exam too well, and I was ok with my grade, and... no, I'm really not tempted at all.  But I do appreciate the opportunity.  Really.

      OK, so Kerry picked Edwards.  I've read no articles about this yet, just saw it on TV this morning in the Attorney Lounge for a few seconds.  So this is uncorrupted opinion here (and really what I have to say is pretty unobjectionable, I think), but I think Edwards was the safest choice for Kerry, since any other choice would have led to the question, "Why not Edwards?" and that would've been the story.  So by picking Edwards he probably makes less news -- since it was the expected choice, and thus probably won't have days and days of analysis to follow, as perhaps there would be if he'd picked Hillary Clinton or Kermit the Frog or Tipper Gore or anyone else he might've dug up from the woodwork somewhere (Kerry-Mondale in '04?), but he also probably makes most Democrats at least pleased enough with the choice that if they were going to vote for him this won't stop them, and maybe get him some new voters who really liked Edwards.  Yeah, I've got nothing really useful to say here.  Except for this:   Top Five Related Top Ten Lists I Considered, But Realized I Couldn't Keep the Joke Going for Ten, with one example for each to illustrate   1. Top Ten reasons not to pick Edwards that Kerry overlooked ("People thought *Kerry* had Botox; look at Edwards!?")  2. Top Ten reasons Dick Gephardt wasn't picked ("Campaigning in sunny states would be hazardous toward Gephardt's pale complexion that has become his trademark.")  3. Top Ten rejected slogans for the Kerry-Edwards tickets ("Use the john.  Or vote for them.")  4. Top Ten reasons Bill Richardson wasn't picked ("Despite being Hispanic, name does not sound Hispanic, and therefore only the informed voters would be influenced; informed voters form such a low percentage of the electorate that it would not be worth it.")  5. Top Ten reasons Tom Vilsack wasn't picked ("To people who haven't heard of him, his name sounds kind of obscene, in a strange sort of way.")

Appears to be a Blogger-wide problem.  Nothing I'm doing.  Can't really complain, since Blogger is free, but hope no one's just giving up after one try.  Hopefully Blogger will have it fixed someday.

      Quick test re: the power of the Internet:  If you were inspired to buy a piece of swordfish in the supermarket this afternoon, to cook for dinner, what would you do with it?  My default is to squirt some lemon on it and stick it in the oven for a little bit, but I'm open to other ways to deal with it.  I've also got some yellow tomatoes, if that inspires anything.  Damn you, Whole Foods Market, for making food seem so delicious!  :)   [UPDATE: No grill at home -- to answer one reader's question -- but I chose the stovetop griddle pan instead of the oven, sliced some fennel (also courtesy of Whole Foods), sprinkled on some chili powder and black pepper, and it was very good.]

       urlLink Terry Teachout  has a "cultural quiz" where he asks his readers to choose between two options on a hundred different dimensions and see how often you match him:    (excerpt: 1. Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly? 2. The Great Gatsby or The Sun Also Rises? 3. Count Basie or Duke Ellington? 4. Cats or dogs?) I think I'll try my own.  But I've got to write it first.  Stay tuned.

      I got one e-mail so far for all-request Independence weekend (see below):   "I get the day off Tuesday.  OK Monday too - but I have things I have to do that day.  Now Tuesday is open for anything.  So...I'd like your opinion on what I shoud do on Tuesday.  OK, it's more of a suggestion than an opinion.  How's this - barring a suggestion of illegal activity... I'll do whatever you suggest.  Hmmm.  I'm placing a lot of faith in your opinion today." Interesting.  I guess this gives me the opportunity to riff on what would be a perfect day.  I can try that.  Let's see...  1. Go to sleep early the night before, but don't set your alarm clock.  So you're nice and rested for the day.  2. Get in touch with some friends you haven't seen in a while, but really like spending time with.  See if they're free too.  That'll make the day better, whatever it is you do.  3. Wake up and go to a bakery.  Get something just baked that smells good.  Eat it.  Get some fresh-squeezed juice too.  Probably orange juice, but grapefruit will probably do too.  I don't know if they fresh-squeeze cranberry juice.  It sounds sort of messy.  4. Go for a long walk, with those friends you convinced to take the day off with you.  Talk about the meaning of life.  Find a frisbee on the side of the road.  Toss it around for a while.  Make a bad toss and find yourself chasing the frisbee into a perfect spot for a picnic.  Find a supermarket nearby, buy some fresh ingredients, use the restroom (since by now surely you'd have to go -- the orange juice, the long walk...), and have a picnic.  Linger for a while.  Talk about your hopes and dreams and where you think the frisbee came from.  5. Stumble onto an outdoor concert, featuring a band that isn't very well-known now, but you think you hear some potential.  Buy their self-made CD, even though you know you probably won't listen to it more than once or twice.  Offer them your picnic leftovers.  Serendipitously run into an old friend there.  6. Wander toward the ocean, if there's one in proximity (otherwise a lake will do).  Go swimming.  7. Dry off.  Probably use the restroom again.  Head back home with your friends.  Talk some more.  Share some stories.  Laugh.  Breathe in the fresh air.  Eat some freshly-picked blackberries.  Find a stray dog looking for a home.  Discover an unexpected tax refund in your mailbox.  8. Cook a light dinner, everybody pitching in, preferably with some vegetables you found at a farmer's market, perfectly ripe and in season.  Listen to the birds and crickets.  Ignore the termites.  9. Say goodbye to your friends.  Restroom again, perhaps.  Curl up on the couch with a good book.  Watch something TiVo thought you'd like.  Write a love ballad.  Fold the laundry that's been on the chair for a week.  Yawn.  Brush teeth.  Put on your favorite CD, and let it lull you to sleep.  Not a bad day, right?

      This is  urlLink the coolest website ever , at least on July 4th.  Check it out.  Thanks to  urlLink Evan  for the link.  And: for the holiday, I feel like doing another all-request day, just to get some inspiration.  How about I give you a theme: "things you want my opinion about."  Obviously my expectation is that if anyone bothers to e-mail me, it'll be something along the lines of, "how should I prepare for LSAT," but I'd also (and perhaps even more so) be pleased with an excuse to write about something random that I just wouldn't think of, like my opinion about low-carb milk.  Furthermore: The. Mets. Are. Temporarily. Good.  (This is unusual.)

      I was looking at a take-out menu this morning (reading material is running short I guess) for a place called "Not Just Chicken," whose food I've never tried and don't plan to.  Under Chicken Nuggets, it said, in quotes, "We've Been All White Meat Since 1988!"  Well, lucky us!  What did these chicken nuggets look like before 1988??  Other ridiculous items on the menu: "Extra Jumbo Melted Cheese -- for Cheese Lovers!"  "Bucket of "Wet Style" Buffalo Wings."  "Wet style?"  Are they wet, or are they not?  Are they dry, but pretending to be wet?  Is this like "leather-style seating" that isn't really leather?  And why do you need buffalo wings to be wet anyway?  If they could make them dry, wouldn't they be less messy and therefore easier to eat?  I'm not a buffalo wing expert so I may be missing something.  There's a whole section of the menu titled "Appetizers and Melted Cheese," as if melted cheese is some sort of food category unto itself.  I'm going to the Mets-Yankees game today.  My mom got tickets a while back.  On Friday, the law firm said it had some tickets to give away.  Which makes my tickets somehow feel less special.   Ten Rejected Names for Fireworks  1. Gravestone Flyer 2. Fingers-b-gone 3. The Intestinator  4. Red, white, and more red, mostly blood 5. Maiming Rocket 6. Oops, I Lost A Hand! 7. The Dismemberer 8. Green Bile Shooter 9. Emergency Roominator 10. All the Colors of the Rainbow That Will Be In The Sky On The Day of Your Funeral

      I'm cheating.  It's really 2:25 Sunday morning.  But I've got to grab the Saturday time/date stamp so as to not miss a day.  Not really.  But I'll give you something good on Sunday, I promise, so I feel like it's okay to fudge the date.  I went and saw some pretty mediocre stand-up comedy with some friends.  That's generous.  It was pretty crappy stand-up comedy.  Bad stand-up comedy is frustrating to watch.  None of the performers actually had a personality, a character, a compelling story that made me like them.  They were all just telling standard stand-up-comedy shtick that's not particularly enjoyable to watch.  All of them (except for one, who was borderline tolerable and sometimes even funny) had variations on the same jokes.  About cigarettes, about smoking weed, about blow jobs, and about getting arrested.  Is this what stand-up comedians do?  Are they all drug addicts who get arrested all the time?  Because if good comedy comes from real experiences then it would seem they all are.  One painfully awful female comedian had a bit about how she doesn't understand cloning -- aren't there enough people already?  It is dreadful when you can't even set up a good premise to a joke.  It is hard to feel like laughing at this joke when mostly you're just wondering if she really doesn't know why scientists are trying to clone people.  Now if she'd bought some smart points by saying something clever at any time during her set, I might have given her the benefit of the doubt, but no.  Oh, man, being a stand-up comedian must be the most horrible job in the world.  I think I'd even rather be a lawyer.  But I don't really want to write a dissertation about stand-up comedy, especially not at 2:30 in the morning when if I'm going to bother writing at all, it should at least reveal some of my innermost thoughts and feelings -- you know, stuff I'll feel stupid in the morning for having written.  So here you go.  This may be a function of where I fall on the introverted/extroverted continuum, but if given the choice between spending time with 1 or 2 or 3 people versus 7 or 8 people, I'd usually pick the smaller number.  There's something about doing stuff with a larger group that I find somehow less enjoyable.  The conversation all becomes sort of superficial, and just having to stay engaged can start to feel like a chore.  Not all the time, but some of the time.  Maybe there are two kinds of people.  Some people want to get all their friends in one room and have a big party.  Some people would rather do stuff with each of them in smaller groups.  Maybe there are people who like them both.  I feel like people are more interesting one-on-one, or in groups of three or maybe four.  But bigger than that and I feel like it never gets past a certain level of small talk that just isn't that compelling.  I don't know.  Part of it is that I feel like I sort of shut down in larger groups and find I have nothing to say, and either force myself to say something just for the sake of saying something, which is never smart, or I just sort of withdraw.  It's the introvert/extrovert thing, maybe.   Part of it, to go on a quick tangent elsewhere, is that I'm not always good with new people I don't know.  Sometimes we click, and then it can be great.  But I feel like I have pretty good intuition; that pretty quickly after meeting someone I have a sense of whether or not he or she is a good person, a decent person, an interesting, introspective, compelling person who I think I'd like to be friends with.  And I end up quickly dividing the world into two categories -- people I like being around, and people I can live without.  And I don't know that I'm particularly tolerant, inside, of being around the people I can live without.  Not that I think I'm outwardly hostile to people at all -- I think I'm rarely outwardly hostile, and at worst I'm probably just somewhat disengaged.  But the flip side is that with people I enjoy being around, I actually do enjoy being around them, and am in turn probably much more enjoyable to be around, since I'm actually interested and engaged and not just going through the motions.  But the group starts to get bigger, and then I start to shut down a little, I think -- not because I want to, but just because that's what happens.  I don't know if this makes any sense, or is interesting to anyone except the little person that lives inside my head and makes the brain go 'round.  But it helps to write this stuff down sometimes, I think.  Just to sort out what I'm feeling so I don't have to keep flipping it around in my mind and can get it out there and move on to other stuff.  So that concludes the latest in the "what's going on in my head" series.  Now it's time for sleep.  Very much so.

      1. I saw Spider-Man 2 today.  It's solidly entertaining.  I won't give anything away.  Just note: you should go to the bathroom beforehand.  It's long.  And if your previews are as bad as the ones I saw... you're in for a long first 10 minutes of your moviegoing experience.  Terrible previews.  Terrible.  2. I read Brendan Halpin's "Losing My Faculties" on my commute this morning.  He's a high school English teacher.  It's a book about his experiences.  He's a very good writer.  He's funny, he's introspective, he tells good stories, he paints rich pictures.  A number of years ago, I read his previous book, about his wife's battle with breast cancer.  It's a wrenching read.  He knows how to write.  Good books, both of them.  3. Lawyers may be your best friends if you're planning on setting off any fireworks this weekend.  Watch your fingers.  I'm going to see the Mets-Yankees game on Sunday.  That's pretty much the extent of my plans this 3-day weekend.  Besides hammering out some of a screenplay.  Tomorrow.  If I can get a good night's sleep tonight and be well-rested and motivated.

      At work today we completed a negotiation exercise where we were given lots of documents and facts and split into teams on two sides -- the buyer, and the seller.  The buyer company was buying the seller.  And we had to read our facts and think about the open issues in the deal, and negotiate to an agreement.  The negotiation itself was actually pretty enjoyable -- a fun exercise, certainly.  The week of reading the documents and facts, not as much.  But it was fine.  It followed last week's arbitration exercise, which was to the litigation department what the negotiation exercise was to the corporate department.  Basically, a quick introduction to what their work is like.  In a stylized way.  Next week is our catch-the-typos week, when we learn what life is like in the word processing department.  :)

      On my commute today I read a book called "The Paradox of Choice" by Swarthmore professor Barry Schwartz.  Basically, the book says that we're faced with too many choices in the world today -- 200 kinds of breakfast cereal, 100 kinds of toothpaste, a zillion different career opportunities, places to live, people to marry... and that people were happier when options were more limited, and not every decision needed to be agonized over -- because there was only one fit of blue jeans instead of six, and only one kind of jelly, not forty.  And when every decision has so many choices, it becomes overwhelming and makes us less happy.  Schwartz divides the universe into two types of people -- maximizers and satisficers.  Maximizers always need to find the best -- and feel like they're "settling" if they don't get *the best* deal on a CD player, or pick *the greatest* elective class to take.  Satisficers are willing to stop looking when they find something that meets their standards -- so they can choose the first restaurant, or the sweater in the third store, or the new car -- without feeling like they have to look at every option and make sure they're not passing something up that's better.  Schwartz spends a ton of time talking about jelly and blue jeans, shampoo and CD players, and all sorts of other consumer products, and while he does talk about the opening up of so many where-to-live and what-to-do options, I think it's that part that feels more serious to me, and where I wish he'd spent more energy and put in more work (but Schwartz is a satisficer, who was content to leave about a dozen typos that I caught in his book, and content to, at least as it seemed to me, dumb down his book a bit so that you don't need to be one of his Swarthmore students to understand it, although it does feel like he's probably got a lot more to say and just made a decision to keep the book simple -- and therefore a bit less rewarding than it could have been).    But I digress.  The what-to-do options -- so many choices are out there, and he's right that it's a challenge to decide whether you will "satisfice" and pick a career that will probably make you happy, or whether you'll be a "maximizer" and keep searching until you find the career that's a "perfect" fit (which you may never find).  But Schwartz has it wrong, I think.  People I know aren't picking between being a satisficer and a maximizer -- the problem isn't that we have (or can get) jobs that we think will make us happy and we're passing those up for something even better -- the problem is that we're trying to find the ones that'll make us happy to begin with.  You're not satisficing *or* maximizing when you become an investment banker, hate it, and decide to leave.  The problem is finding the jobs that fit at all -- not passing them up for better things when what you've got is okay to begin with.  The problem with all these career choices isn't that too many are great -- I think it's that too many are pretty terrible, and it's a rotten shame that bright, smart, talented, virtuous, gifted people are shunted into mind-numbing soul-crushing jobs by career services offices, the forces of capitalism, and the odd but very real social pressure to have jobs that sound impressive and pay a high salary but that are really lousy in terms of making people not want to hurl themselves out a window.  That's the book I want to read, not some weak discussion of why too many kinds of shampoo is making me miserable.  Too many kinds of shampoo is not making me miserable.  Too many kinds of shampoo, I feel like I can safely say, has NO IMPACT AT ALL on my emotional state.  Feeling like there are lots of talented people competing for fewer-than-that awesomely super ways to make a living, and being afraid that I will end up doing something I hate just because I'm afraid to take the risk of doing something else -- that's a slightly bigger concern.  Wow, I thought I liked the book until I started typing.  Turns out not so much.  Nothing against Prof. Schwartz.  But shampoo's really not the problem in society today, I don't think.  Apologies if I've made a good point but buried it in enough inarticulate rambling that no one but me knows exactly what I'm saying here.

      We've been asked to invite a partner and an associate to our big-group-last-day-lunch on Friday.  Can I ask a secretary and mailroom employee instead?

      Wow, that sidebar on the left really makes a big difference.  I hated having it on the right.  Trial and error with the template has gotten it back over to the left where it belongs.  Seriously, anyone who hates this new look and is going to stop reading because of it, please e-mail me so I can change it and win you back.  Stop reading if I write crap, not if I change the template.  If this isn't working, help me fix it.

      I bought  urlLink this album  off Amazon Used and got it today.  I had gotten his first album in a used CD store for $1.99, because I'd heard one of the songs and liked it.  And the first album is great.  And this, his second album, is really good too.  He has an awesome voice and writes great, catchy, hummable, solid songs.  I sort of discovered it by accident.  It's cool.  Check it out.

      I've been eating at some nice restaurants this week.  Since it's the last week of the summer associate-ship, the prevailing culture seems to indicate it's even more okay than usual to push close to our unfathomable $60 limit.  Here's what I ate yesterday and today, and what other people at the lunches ate too, as far as I can recall.  I'll try to remember all of the little ingredients, since they're what makes it cool. (UPDATE: actually, I'll just use the menus on their websites to jog my memory.  Super bonus points to anyone who can guess where I ate...)  I realize this post sounds so ridiculous -- that I can write so much about my $60 lunches and talk about what foods I liked and what I didn't.  I know it all sounds pretty absurd.  It is pretty absurd.  But a lot of things about being a summer associate are absurd (more of that coming down the pike soon, I promise promise promise).  So here is lots about expensive food.  Yesterday.  Appetizers.  I had the heirloom tomato salad, which was 6 very thin slices of tomato (adding up to perhaps one normal slice of tomato; I imagine that in a day they probably go through about 1 tomato) topped with croutons, baby beets, tetilla cheese (whatever that is) and tarragon.  Some others at the table had the lobster roll, which contained pistachio and lemon yogurt, marinated salmon roe, and came with a shot glass filled with a "homeade ginger ale granita" that was curious enough that I'd wished I ordered it.  Main Courses.  I had the hot smoked arctic char, which is kind of a lighter-than-salmon-but-very-salmonesque kind of fish, atop a white-vegetable puree and covered with an apple-flavored broth that got poured from a tea kettle.  Aside from spending too much energy wondering whether the crispy fish skin that was atop the filet was edible (I decided it might be, but I wasn't going to risk being wrong about that, since it didn't look so tasty anyway), it was very good.  The associate to my right got the brioche-wrapped salmon, which looked like an art project, and included cauliflower tempura and some brown stuff I couldn't identify and isn't mentioned on the website.  The rare seared tuna and scallops that the guy on my left got looked like a winner.  I was sort of wishing I'd gotten that.  Desserts.  The one I got isn't even ON the website!  I got a rhubarb thing (I'm into the fruit desserts much more than the chocolate stuff -- I don't like chocolate so much) -- a scoop of rhubarb sorbet, a little stewed rhubarb atop a cracker, a small peppercorn flan (as interesting as it sounds), a stick of caramelized rhubarb, and a scoop of a very powerful soft cheese that I was not such a fan of (neither was the one on my right who tasted it).  But a good dessert nonetheless.  The peach soup looked interesting.  The blueberry sorbet got a poor review from the associate across the table.  The apple sorbet looked like it would have been a solid choice.  The peanut butter parfait with fried bananas and lime sorbet looked like the most interesting, but the bite I tried made me think the peanut butter flavor was a little too intense for me.  Today.  Appetizers.  I got the roasted leeks with sunchokes and some fishy stuff.  It was good but the wrong choice.  The guy next to me got the escargot risotto that looked infinitely more interesting.  They had an heirloom tomato salad as a special that I would have tried if I hadn't gotten the heirloom tomato appetizer yesterday. I was tempted to get the octopus fricasee, which sounded good, but I've had octopus appetizers at 3 or 4 restaurants so far this summer, so I decided to change it up.  Main Courses.  I got the roasted skate, which came with 3 purees -- an eggplant puree, an unidentified green puree that tasted like a very mild pesto, and an apple puree that was very tasty.  I'd had skate once before and liked it.  And again, I liked it.  Even though I've heard people say they're ugly ocean bottomfeeders.  It was good.  The guy next to me, after his interesting appetizer, got the bass, and something got poured over it -- cockles and cockle broth, I think, although beats me what the heck a cockle is.  2 summers got lobster, which looked like lobster -- good I'm sure, but maybe not interesting enough.  Since I'm never, ever, ever, ever again going to be eating in restaurants like this, I figure I'd rather try weird stuff.  But no one can fault the lobster choice.  Dessert.  I had a really good dessert.  I got a linzer tart with buttermilk sorbet.  Very cool.  Very very delicious.  I really liked it.  The passionfruit pudding looked cool too, especially when they spooned huckleberries on it.  I don't even know what a huckleberry is!  Gum.  I had a piece of Eclipse gum later in the day.  The hints of wintergreen made the gum especially fragrant and the freshness pack gave it a nice and soft mouthfeel.

      AHH!  Okay, I messed up.  I was playing around with new templates and didn't realize it was kind of irreversible once I clicked on the button that warned me it was irreversible.  I was just playing.  I think this may have been a mistake.  And then I had to fool around with making it not completely unreadable, and adding back in my counter codes.  If someone's looking to do some pro bono blogger template design work and thinks they can work magic here, please, I'm all ears.  All feedback on how to make this site look cool is more than welcomed to e-mail me with thoughts.  Frightening.  Hope it didn't startle you.  UPDATE 2:38 PM -- I think this looks ok, yes?  Maybe?  Tell me.

       Happy Birthday, Weblog   My blog turns 2 years old in about 20 minutes.  To celebrate, I've brought  urlLink My Index  up to date.  Basically, my index is just a list of all of the more substantial posts, divided into some rough categories.  So if you're looking for specific advice, or what life at a firm is like, or song parodies, or just to see what's there, that's easier than scrolling through all of the archives.  Although scrolling through the archives is certainly not discouraged.  :)  So.  2 years I've been doing this.  That's a while.  On August 8, 2002, I received my 1L course schedule in the mail, and decided it would be cool to start writing a diary of my law school experience.  I had never read a weblog before I started writing one, and only got the idea from an article I'd read somewhere a few weeks prior mentioning Blogger.  Doing it this way, I am quite sure, has been immensely more rewarding and fulfilling than if I'd just bought a really big book of blank pages and written in it every night.  Knowing there are people out there reading this stuff, and maybe even enjoying it, is very very cool.  I'm grateful to anyone who wasn't amused one day but decided to come back the next anyway, just in case.  I hope I've made it as worthwhile for you to read as it's been worthwhile for me to write.  Anyway.  That is the 2-year update.

      NeoTokyoTimes posts a  urlLink response  to my counter-perspective on preparing for the LSAT (scroll down a few posts).  Can't disagree with him here -- "I guess the moral of this story is that everyone's different. The advice I gave may well not have been useful for all people, or in fact most people.... But you know what, that's how I was able to do well at the LSAT."  Totally fair.  I think my post wasn't so much motivated by any thought that the LSAT is some sort of intuitive test that no one should need to study for -- I don't think I really believe that, and I think it's totally sensible to spend real time preparing for it, however works best for you, because it does affect where you end up going to law school in a pretty major way.  The post was much more motivated as a reaction to the idea that studying for the LSAT somehow needs to take over one's life.  And the broader point that this what happens to, I think, too many people in law school.  If there's a typical law student personality type, which there may or may not be, my sense is that there are an awful lot of people whose default is to get really obsessive over stuff that they don't need to be worrying about so much.  To make themselves unhappy and stressed and miserable because they feel like their reading/exams/interviews/etc are not just important (which, to varying extents, they are), but the only thing it is possible to think about while they are occurring.  I'm pretty sure this must make law school -- and probably life -- less enjoyable for them, and also less enjoyable for everyone else because we have to be around them.  :)  That's coming out worse than I mean it.  I just mean that maybe there's a fetishization of obsessiveness that maybe doesn't need to exist, and maybe would make law students and lawyers less unhappy if it went away.  So I read NeoTokyo's post, and the line about not wasting any mental energy on anything but the LSAT just made me want to respond with another perspective.  But it got him into a great school, so who can possibly say he did anything wrong in the process?  He did good.  He's right that all I really meant is that his way may not be for everyone...

      Over at NeoTokyoTimes, there's a  urlLink well-intentioned post  about preparing for the LSAT that I don't really agree with much at all.  I'll skip the paragraph I could write about why I think test prep classes are useless for people who want to score at the end of the scale that's going to get them into top schools, because they're simply not designed for people getting those scores; and I'll skip the paragraph I could write about how they're a waste of $1000 anyway, because if you don't have the motivation to just sit down and take some practice tests, what are you doing signing up for more years of school?  And I'll skip mentioning that although I didn't take a prep class as a student, I trained to be a Kaplan teacher (I was bored... thought it could be fun... ended up not teaching a class, but I do have a whole box of useless materials... should I put them on E-Bay?) and found most of the advice they were trying to distribute to be not just unhelpful, but probably hurtful, like "skip a logic game."  Uh, not if you want to score well....  But I do want to take issue with this section from the post: "But limiting my non-work activities to the LSAT kept me focused. I kept away from local politics, clubs, and social entanglements....  Dont expend limited mental resources on non-LSAT activities. " (emphasis added, by me, just for fun)  This seems to be taking it to a bit of an extreme.  Take some practice tests, feel comfortable with it, and then just go take the dumb test.  Taking the LSAT is not a life-altering experience, it's not something you need to spend days and weeks and months preparing for, it's not something to take over your life.  It's a test.  If you're going to law school, you've seen tests like this before.  They all correlate pretty well with one another.  You'll do as well as you can do.  If just preparing to take the LSAT makes your life lonely and miserable, you're not going to be very happy once you get to law school.  (Incidentally, "limited mental resources" ???  Are they really all that limited?  We all waste an awful lot of time.  I'm not sure that's a resource anyone's running out of all that quickly.  "Limited focus on doing practice LSATs," perhaps.  But I don't think it goes too far beyond that.)  (Also, I was going to use this as a nice opportunity to paste in the LSAT advice I sent to a couple of friends a few years ago, but I can't find those e-mails.  I'll look again when I get home tonight.  This is here to remind me to do that.  I thought I may have posted it before, but on quick glance I maybe didn't.)

      CNN has an  urlLink article  on job burnout, listing 10 signs you are  "crispy" (can they please fire whoever came up with that term, incidentally), including:   2. The quality of your work has suffered, but you don't care.  3. You arrive consistently late to work.  8. You don't have enough work to keep busy, but lack motivation to seek new assignments.  9. Time drags and you constantly watch the clock. Presented without comment, suitable for forwarding to your friends in jobs they hate.

      Two random thoughts that will vanish into the ether if I don't put them somewhere:  1. You know how in amusement parks they have those booths that take your photo when you're on the roller coaster, and make you pass by the booth and look at your photo on the way off the coaster, in the hope of tempting you to make an impulse purchase?  They should do that at museums too.  "See how thoughtful I looked when staring at that piece of art?  I want to save that image."  2. We already have the Miss USA and Miss Teen USA pageants.  Will it be a sign that society is in deep, deep trouble when (and we all know this day will come) we have the Miss Pre-Teen USA pageant?

      A good friend of mine has written a play, and rented some theater space to put it up this weekend.  It's called "The Great Americano," and I don't know exactly what it's about, but for $10, you can take a chance you'll be seeing an early work from a future great American playwright.  Potential reward greater than at most movies, for the same price, and the only risk is you get so disillusioned about theater that you never go see another play again.  It premiered tonight.  I'm going to see it either on Friday (the 6th) or Saturday (the 7th).  It's also playing next Tuesday (the 10th).  All shows -- Friday, Saturday, and Tuesday -- at 8PM at The Red Room (85 East 4th Street, between 2nd Ave. and 3rd Ave., 3rd floor).  No reservations necessary, general admission, no wheelchair access... nothing else on the postcard I need to say I guess.  3 actors.  I know 2 of them (one's the guy who wrote it).  I'm also friends with the director.  All very talented people.  I will vouch for it.  Otherwise I wouldn't be posting about it.  Go.  Why not?  You have something better to do?

      New York is a hard city to live in.  I feel like I can say that because I'm from here, and so I'm immune to the usual responses about how it's so much better because of all the things to do, or whatever.  It's hard to live here.  Or maybe it's hard to work here and commute a decent ways.  I think that's it more than just the city.  It gets tiring.  It gets tiring to have to wake up in the morning and plan your whole day, because you can't go home in between.  To have to carry your day's "supplies" with you because no car to keep them in, no house you'll be going back to 6 hours later to get them.  It's hard to schedule stuff with the right space between, so you don't have to kill time, but also so you don't have to rush whatever you're doing.  And then if someone else is late, it throws it all off.  Which isn't a big deal if you're at home waiting for someone.  But kind of pain if you're on a street corner waiting for someone.  It's hard to remember to carry an umbrella, and tiring to kill time when it's raining even if you do have one.  It's tiring to rely on the subway and bus and get home really late even if you don't finish what you're doing all that late.  It's a little bit tiring to plan meeting up with people around something else to do, like eating or seeing a movie or watching someone do something (usually for an admission fee), just because it's too hot.cold.wet to sit in a park, and there's nowhere else to sit because no one has a couch, or an apartment (a) big enough for more than one human being, (b) not really far away, and (c) reasonably comfortable.  One of my friends, not all that recently, made a comment that he wishes real life was more like college, where people just hang out in each other's dorm room, or just stop by to visit.  Adults don't seem to do that.  Not even children pretending to be adults, like people my age are.  Maybe it's just a New York thing, because things are far away and dirty and crowded.  It's hard to buy food in New York because you need to get it from the store to where you live.  It's hard to buy anything large you need, like furniture.  It's hard to find a place to sit.  Or just to think.  Because it's loud, and busy, and dirty.  And, yes, there's lots of good ethnic food, much of it pretty cheap.  And there's lots of independent movies to see, some of them decent.  And stand-up comedy, and museums, and lectures -- but who goes to museums and lectures anyway?  And bookstores and music stores and all sorts of stuff like that, although that stuff is so much easier (and now cheaper too) online, so who needs the bookstores.  The saving grace is that there are lots of people, and job opportunity stuff, and people from everywhere gravitate here, and I know people, so there's people to hang out with and do stuff with that wouldn't be there in other places.  And I'll gladly pick tiring over lonely any time, so no complaints.  But some days I'm just tired of tiring.  I'm tired of the subway.  I'm tired of not just being able to walk across a campus and knock on someone's door and just hang out and watch TV or talk or do nothing for a little while.  To not have to structure everything around a meal.  I don't eat that much.  I'm full.  I had a big lunch.  I don't like pretending I care where we eat when really I e-mailed you just to see you and talk to you and we don't have to eat.  Or see that thing.  Or don't see that thing.  Although lots of things are worth seeing.  Sort of.  I don't miss things I don't see.  These are stupid things to be complaining about.  Maybe this is just a long ramble about how cool the suburbs are.  People have couches there.  And cars.  And you can breathe.  Unless you're allergic to the trees.  Then you can't.

      Fifteen questions I'm* tired of answering at summer associate lunches:  1. "What kind of law do you want to do?" 2. "Didn't your parents ever teach you any table manners?" 3. "How do you think the summer is going so far?" 4. "Are you going to eat that?" 5. "What's been your favorite summer associate event?" 6. "Would you please close your mouth when you chew?" 7. "Have you been keeping busy?" 8. "You do realize there's a restroom in the back, right?" 9. "What department do you think you want to join?" 10. "If you were just going to spit that all out onto the tablecloth, why did you even order it?" 11. "Are you upset the summer's almost over?" 12. "Do you smell something?" 13. "What kind of assignments haven't you gotten that you wish you'd had a chance to try?" 14. "Did you at least bring a change of clothes?" 15. "How excited are you to come back next year as a full-time associate?"  *Not the real me.  The fictional me that I'm inventing for purposes of writing this post.  I actually do have table manners.  Although I get my butter knife confused with the other knives sometimes, and still haven't quite mastered the whole 'tearing off bite sized pieces of bread' thing without interrupting the flow of conversation.

"Someone else asked me to keep my schedule pretty clear today." 5. "Oh, I just took another project no more than five minutes ago." 6. "I recently suffered a brain injury." 7. "My computer's broken." 8. "I have a doctor's note saying I shouldn't do any work today." 9.

      Five summer associate assignments to avoid, based on the first fifteen words or less:  1. "See this big stack of papers here?  I need you to..." 2. "So, a lot of other people have looked at this, but..." 3. "What do you know about the latest revision to..." 4. "This may seem a bit tedious, and I apologize for assigning it..." 5. "Has anyone ever shoved a sharp metal rod..."

      Good post from  urlLink Sherry  about balance and structure in life.  Inspires some thinking on my end that I promise I will share in an upcoming post, but won't promise it'll be today.  Also I owe you part 2 of the Mega-Post on thoughts to ponder when thinking about whether to go to law school.  And, while I'm at it, I'll copy Sherry's lead and do an All-Request Day at some point later this week, because they're fun -- but only if people send me questions.  I'll write something either way.  But the e-mail/day ratio has been falling this week -- mostly because the sent e-mail/day has been falling for a couple of weeks now, I'm sure -- so the more the merrier.  :)

      Two random things before I go to sleep:  >>At my imaginary theme park, instead of "Guess Your Weight" they would have "Guess Your IQ."  They'd ask you a few questions, pick a number, and then have you take an IQ test to see if they were right.  Maybe this is why my imaginary theme park would go bankrupt.  >>A poem, based on lunch today:  4 scallops 31 dollars 4 scallops And a mound of vegetables Asparagus Peas, Carrots, Corn Undercooked corn In a green sauce Maybe more vegetables Maybe not 4 scallops 31 dollars 4 scallops Too much salt

      The logical next step:   I've got two open spots for lunch at Gramercy Tavern on Wednesday.  That's Wednesday, June 21, 2006, 4 weeks into the first summer when we're back as first-year associates.  I've spoken to an incoming 1L at my school, who's definitely set on spending her summer after 2L at a New York law firm, and this place is high on her list at this point.  Assuming she gets an offer and comes to summer here, she asked me if I might be able to do lunch on Wednesday, June 21.  She's pretty confident she can find 2 other summers; so I told her I'd find 2 other first-years to join us on the lunch.  First two to respond get the slots.  If you've already got plans for 6/21, she might be able to do Friday 6/23, but she's concerned that the Trusts & Estates assignment she's already scheduled to receive on Thursday 6/22 may interfere.  Or she may be hung over from the trip the night before to see the new Broadway musical, "O.J. Simpson: 10 Years Later -- A Journey in Song," and the after-party on the moon, assuming by 2006 we're taking quick rocket trips to the moon for after-parties after summer associate events.  Also, she'll be wearing purple, just so you're aware and don't clash.  And in case of rain (the weather report gives it a 40% chance), we might go somewhere closer.  Or at least take one of the new hover-taxis.  Let me know as soon as possible if you want in on the lunch. I'm only barely exaggerating.

      I called Sprint PCS customer service last night -- for a few days, my cell phone has been sending all calls straight to voicemail, and then alerting me I have voicemail.  So it's not ringing or flashing or anything like that when a call comes in, but everything else seems okay.  Not a tremendously horrible problem, but seems worth fixing, or at least figuring out why my phone has gotten too lazy to ring.  In my mind, I've concluded that I did something to cause this -- I sent a couple of calls straight through to voice mail Friday afternoon, and since then the phone hasn't rung, so maybe it figured, after I sent two calls right to voice mail, that I never want it to ring again.  Or maybe as I was pushing the button on the side to send the calls to voicemail, I accidentally pushed some combination of buttons that said to do this permanently, and I just can't figure out how to unpush them.  But anyway, I called Sprint, and the woman ran the phone through a number of "tests," had me remove the battery, had me punch in a bunch of codes, stuff like that -- got me "restarted on the system," and nothing worked.  She said my phone is "probably broken" and I should go to a Sprint store.  At the end of the call, she asked me to rate her service on a scale from 1-10.  I told her she was very nice, but since my phone still isn't working, I don't really know what to rate it.  She said she needed me to rate her service, "for quality control."  Again, I said that she was very nice, but since the phone isn't working, I'd have to give "the service" a 1.  She said she didn't need me to rate "the service" but "her service."  So I told her I'd give her a 10, but the service a 1.  She said, "Oh, a 10.  That's very sweet of you.  Thank you so much."  "But my phone still doesn't work...."  Click.  Any amateur cell phone technicians who have any clue, before I go to the Sprint store later to let them tell me I need a new phone, I'll forward you a $5 gift certificate from Amazon.com that I got at work from the Lexis rep for answering a Lexis trivia question if you can tell me how to fix my phone and it works.  UPDATE: My phone randomly started working again about an hour after I went to the Sprint store, saw the unbelievably long line, and left without going inside.  I guess that scared the phone too.  I don't know why it's working again, but there are many mysteries of life that I don't need to understand.

      If I've written this post before, I can't remember.  But I may have, since there's really nothing about right now that's prompting it.  I'm sure there are people who stumble on this site who aren't yet law students, but are thinking about law school, and whether it's right for them.  So I thought I'd summon some thoughts on what I didn't know when I started law school that might have been things I'd have considered, couched in some autobiography so this all makes some sense.  It's not quite the "why you should go to law school" post (although I guess I could do one of those too), but let's call it:   The "So I'm Thinking About Law School... Or At Least Thinking About Thinking About Law School... But I'm Not Even Really Sure What That Means" Mega-Post, Part 1   I. I don't exactly know how I ended up in law school.  I took the LSAT because a friend of mine was taking the LSAT at some point during junior year of college, and I figured law school wasn't something I knew I *didn't* want to do, so I didn't see any harm in taking the LSAT and then at least it's an option.  So I took the LSAT.  And then senior year came around, and, since I'd taken the LSAT, I applied to law school, not really with any intention of going.  And then I found myself at the "Science and Technology Career Fair" to grab some koosh balls and t-shirts, and ended up handing someone my resume, and somehow, after some interviews, I ended up convinced that working for a software company in the middle of Texas made good sense.  Which maybe it did.  But at the very least it became an alternative to law school... until two years later when I realized that maybe working for a software company in the middle of Texas didn't make sense anymore, and law school sounded as good as anything else... 3 more years to figure out what did make sense, and it wouldn't be a bad line to have on the resume.  Truth is, the most frustrating part about the software job was not knowing what it was leading toward... and at least I knew that law school, even if it sucked, would be leading toward a degree in the end, and the three years couldn't be a complete waste.  Even if I didn't practice law.  This is probably terrible reasoning for why someone should go to law school, but that isn't the point of this post, and, besides, I like law school.  I'm glad I went to law school.  I've enjoyed it.  No regrets.  II. But I didn't know anything about law school, or lawyers, or what lawyers do, or what law school teaches you.  I knew I'd be taking classes about the law.  That's about the extent of what I knew.  I honestly didn't really think about it that much.  I didn't know any lawyers -- at big firms, at small firms, at no firms, in government, at public interest organizations... I'm not completely sure I knew what a public interest organization was, and I know I couldn't have named a single law firm.  I didn't have any idea that the legal world -- or at least the legal world as presented in law school -- was basically split into two categories.  Firms, and Public Interest.  It's not that I thought it was something else; I just didn't think about it at all.  III. One of the bigger surprises 1L year was that basically two months in, everyone started looking for a summer job.  I went to law school to avoid looking for a job... so this was not terrifically happy news.  But there everyone was, with their lists of firms, and their lists of public interest organizations, knowing what lawyers do, and what they thought *they* wanted to do, and all ready to start their legal careers.  But I thought... I thought this was school school, not vocational school.  I was ready to read.  Not so eager to write cover letters.  IV. And so here is where I finally get to making the point I should have just started the whole post with.  Before you go to law school, understand: law school, much more than I expected, is trade school.  The legal world that we're presented with has two categories: law firms, and public interest jobs.  Later on, you discover there are also clerkships (working for judges), which can lead to academia (teaching), but just as often lead right back to firms or public interest.  If these are not the careers you want to pursue, you will be swimming against a very strong current -- a current that can take hold of your body and carry it along, even if you started out intending to swim in a different direction.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but I truly believe the current changes people's destinations quite often.  It is very easy to go through the recruiting process and end up at a law firm.  Easy enough that you can do it without much effort or thinking, and in fact if you don't expend much effort or thinking, that's probably exactly what will happen.  V. The problem, I think, is that law school forces you to make these choices pretty early on, and without much background.  I didn't know what a law firm did until I worked at one this summer.  And I'm still not entirely sure what people do at public interest organizations.  And as far as what other lawyers do?  Not much of a clue.  Because they don't come and recruit.  I mean, the same thing sort of happens in undergrad, when consulting firms and investment banks are the only people who come to recruit, and you start to feel like those are the only options out there.  When there are surely a gazillion more jobs -- but they don't need to come and recruit because they have enough people coming to find them, or they're smaller and don't need entering classes of 50 people and so it doesn't make any sense to go to college campuses.  Same thing with law school.  The [fill in whatever law job I'm unaware of] doesn't need to come recruit because (1) they're not looking for people with no experience, (2) people find them, and (3) it makes no economic sense to come and recruit.  But because the firms do come to campus, the whole law school experience ends up tailored around sending us there -- the recruiting season, interviews, career panels, etc.  VI.  The next logical step in this piece would be to tell you what exactly law firms and public interest organizations do, at least as far as I know, in case you don't, and you want to go to law school.  So I'll call that part 2 and write it tomorrow.  :)
