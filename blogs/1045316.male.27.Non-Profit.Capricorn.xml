      I finally found a place to live in Los Angeles, at least for the first month. A candid response to my posting for temporary housing on craigslist.org caught my attention and it's less that three miles to my office and it's in West Hollywood close to the action.   Let's hope he's not psycho, but my intuition tells me it will work out. His name is John Thomas (that's his first and middle name). He told me his last, but i don't remember it. It's irish.  Weitser is at work right now and tomorrow's my birthday. I've been working my ass off for glaad from home since the middle of October and look forward to having a space in their office - where i can work face to face with these guys. I leave for Freeport for Christmas with the family on Dec. 24 and head back to austin the day after christmas. Then the next day off to Los Angeles. I need to spend today and tommorrow packing my stuff for the trip and for shipping. I need to talk with aunt debbie to see how her fedex employee discount can help a gay nephew in need.  To the shower i go. Bye blogger. happy holidays.

      Wow. Time is ticking away. My 26th birthday is Sunday and then it's less than a week before I load my Subaru and head to LA. I still don't have a place to stay there. Hopefully it will all work out. Thus far, a Japanese filmmaker girl has offered her living room for the month (to make some cash to pay back her film bills) and this other gentleman has offered his living room as well.  Finding a place from Texas has proven to be a difficult task. There are lots of places available, but i am not in LA to hand over a big check and sign a lease like the dozens of other dwelling-seeking folks. In the meantime, I am going to go and shower and shave. If you've got a place for me to stay in LA, send me an email. :-)

      wow. life is so different these days. despite the fact it's the middle of january, today was a blistering 80 degrees. the sweet aromas from hundreds of blooming plants and dozens of palm trees stretching into the big blue sky. and the santa ana winds. the devil winds. i have time to notice these things now that i have started settling into my new pad. i am slowly falling in love with it. love takes time. and in this case, some cash. so i'll save you the details on my new pad until i get it furnished and organized. for now, suffice it to say i've got at least two windows in every room, don't share walls, floors, ceilings or a bathroom with anyone, and have a great private patio. I can pick avocados from the tree down the street and lemmons from my neighbor's. tomorrow they install the blinds on my double french doors. eventually, photos of my pad will be  urlLink    here  , so check it out.  i am delighted that this weekend is one of three days. and for such  a good reason: martin luther king, jr day. and to many more dreams, baby.  i will take the time to acoomplish some much needed business .. like figuring how to get my name off of chex systems -- as they render one helpless in today's world by making it impossible to get a bank account. i also need to go and buy some new essentials ... like socks and underwear and towels and such. and find some screws to put the legs on my table. perhaps i'll buy some paint and some material to cover my sofa. i will most certainy attempt my laundry.  enuf of chores. i am off to nap. this working 40+ hours a week is taxing. and my physiological (sp) self is still in texas.

      It's wartime -- and has been for almost twenty days now. I've blacked myself out from the war coverage on the networks; it's all awash with blind patriotism and driven by pollsters and politicians. All this on the heals of proposed changes in FCC regulations that would eliminate restrictions on how many outlets media giants can own. Already six or seven companies control almost ALL of the media most of us see. We should all be alarmed. As the Bush administration continues to ride the wave of terror to accomplish their goals and completely change the face of America, all the while claiming "we're living in different times" because of September 11, 2001. There's no denying Sept. 11 was a wake-up call - and demanded a re-evaluation of the way we do things - and the dangers that now threaten our  shores. An event of such magnitude demanded a response; a response of lasting international implications should be well-thought and calculated. Instead, catalyzed by the American citezens' manufactured desire for instant results, Bush and his team set into motion a response that has proven to incite religious extremism abroad (which shouldn't be surprising since so many religious fundamentalists are electing themselves to run our country), systematically strip Americans of their civil liberties in the name of homeland security, and through oftentimes obvious propaganda promote blind patriotism that equates dissent with treason and attributes the negative world view of our government to our own peace protests and demonstrations. This is a call to arms. Arm yourself with a diversified world view. Arm yourself with the power of activism and the results of your vote. Take your mind beyond a two-party whiteboy system that neglects equality and bows to Jesus at every turn. Get to know the gatekeepers.

      Today was the day. My energies were honed on a healthier existence -- the first steps of which will prove to be most difficult. A gym membership and the final cessation of smoking cigarettes. It's long past due and reciting the reasons for a healthier living here are a waste of time as we all know what's best for us. It's in taking the step I took today we find wisdom and relief. Cheers to a healthier future where cigarettes are out and my well-being is in.

      The California Recall election has excited me to the possibilities of politics. Rather than weaving my way into one of the two parties controlling our country, i may start by shaping the depate as a third-party person. I've been thinking a lot about my presidential campaign of late. I would love to run in 2020 or 2024. That will give me enough time to get my shit together. But I need to recruit volunteers now. How often in history does a presidential campaign begin 20 years before the election? It starts now.

      I hope all of you are a bit concerned about the state of affairs in this country. The republicans, begining with the Presidential election in Florida, have systematically taken over the government. Stacking school boards and city councils with Right Wing extremists, redistricting congressional lines to pack the House and Senate, financing a recall 'do-over' gubanatorial election in California -- all while the "Yes, Mr. President" media in this country refuses to look a the REAL issues.  We're living in troubling times. You can choose to act now or you can wait a few more years until the disparity forces your hand. We'd be better off starting today.

      The California Recall election never ceases to amaze me. Within the last two days, Arnold Swartzenegger has been accused (and appologized for) sexually assaulting several women -- AND -- saying he doesn't recall his comments praising Hitler. AND his poll numbers have gone up. SAVE US! VOTE NO ON THE RECALL. ---

      Let me sum this up for you: Our govt. is using Sept. 11 and the "war on terrorism" to slowly but surely take away your civil rights. Whether through the Patriot Act, Patriot Act 2 (which recently received so much scrutiny and outcry it was withdrawen by the Bush administration, who then took hundreds of its provisions and dropped them into non-germane legislation headed through Congress to be passed mostly unwittingly into law), an Executive order or EVEN something as miniscule as the hunch of an Agent of "Homeland Security", the govt. now spies on you and they are not obliged under law to tell anyone about it. The article below details the first PROOF that the FBI targets Americans for 'potential terrorism' in efforts to minimize political damage to the Bush Administration. I am sure the fact i've posted this on Friendster has already been placed in my FBI File.  -------------------------- F.B.I. Scrutinizes Antiwar Rallies  By ERIC LICHTBLAU   Published: November 23, 2003   WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 — The Federal Bureau of Investigation has collected extensive information on the tactics, training and organization of antiwar demonstrators and has advised local law enforcement officials to report any suspicious activity at protests to its counterterrorism squads, according to interviews and a confidential bureau  memorandum.

      My brother Mark came in Saturday night -- just in time to go to a party in Beverly Hills. It was nice for him to see that side of things in this crazy town. As we arrived, Mindy Cohen (Natalie from TV's  The Facts of Life ) was leaving. She let us know the party was over. "Oh, that's what I heard," I told her. "I am here to pick up Sabrina." That was a lie, of course, but who needs to hear Mindy Cohen tell you the party's over? Anyways -- Mark got a nice tour of Glen's mansion and his closet with a balcony. There was also a snow machine there and such. Earlier Sunday we drove around in Beverly Hills so Mark could see   some of the opulence. We accidentally came across the Ozbourne's house. We also went up into Griffith Park and I took some photos of mark with the HOLLYWOOD sign behind him. You know, all the touristy type stuff. Later this week we will make  our way to the beach and do the Hollywood Blvd. star-thingy. We're having a Christmas party at the office on Tuesday and Christmas Eve dinner at my boss' house in North Hollywood Hills. Anyhow, it's getting late, and despite my five-hour nap today, I need to get some rest. Peace.

      My holiday break officially started today after work. Tonight I will be busy preparing my pad for my 23-year-old brother's arrival. He's never been to SoCal before so we are sure to have a lovely time exploring the sights and sounds. His flight lands at 1730 Saturday at LAX. Of all i've heard bad about that place, i've been there a dozen times and not ever had any substantial complaints.  That's about it for now, i think, but i wanted to get a little update in here before too long. Bottom line: I am off work for the next week, then for new years i am hosting Harrison and Renee and it will be fabulous. Peace be with you.

       Last night was spectacular. My dear wife Kellie organized a killer party for my 27th birthday at her Hollywood pad, complete with homemade lasagne and hippy strength brownies. It was a verified gathering of the people that continue to color my life in all their glorious speldor. Kellie and Laura were the most gracious hosts ever, serving up an endless supply of vodka, munchies and beer. I smile everytime i think about it. Nubian Goddess Sabrina Taylor brought her new video camera and was very stealth in her moves. So stealth, in fact, that I am not sure if she taped anything or not. My new group of budz were there: Matt Chun, Sam Lucas, John Hahn, Cuong, Darren, Chris -- and then Jerrod and Eric showed up ALL the way from Los Feliz! (it's over the hill) Sara Mayer and Jessica Tate came -- midge was hot as EVER with a bitchin' new do from Jessica, who was stunning herself and ON KEY like aways. (let me know if you need your hair did, and i'll put you in touch with Taters) Several of those who collaborate with me at GLAAD were there as well. Nick Adams (love you, Nick!), Mario "D-List" Lavandeira, and the beautiful Alanna Boyd joined us as did Task Force Freedom Fighter Clayton Yeung. Ex Patriot Brendan Hooley (so good to see you, B.) was there with his new Hottie McSmart boyfriend as well. The biggest surprise of the evening was when Kellie lit the candles on my cake and everyone sang happy birthday and then i blew them out and everyone said "speech speech speech" and then i turned around to thank everyone and then i saw Ricky Bennett! who from out of the blue (actually form El Paso to Seattle via LAX layover) stopped in to give me a big huge shock -- one of those rare moments that you will never forget. Ricky, for those of you who don't know, is my bestest bud every since second grade in that shrimpy town of Freeport, TX. Another highlight of the evening was when Sabrina, Wilson Cruz, Mario Lavandeira, and Matt Chun were belting out Whitney's Houston's Greatest Hits -- it was a sight to be seen and heard. And i am sure many more heard it than saw it -- as it was, let's say, LOUD. It was a truly fabulous night and one i will cherish as my first full year in Los Angeles comes to a close. Time flies, and moments like last night help to punctuate our journey -- a time to celebrate the years past in the light of today while nursing nostalgia and helping to light tomorrow's path.  I am a lucky guy, and I love you all. * and many more *

      Our government has been bought and sold by the Bush Administration. From the IRS crediting only the richest Americans (and the corporations that keep them rich) -- to the Environmental Protection Agency denying global warming exists -- to the Securities & Exchange Commission's (SEC) failure to enforce laws (while simultaneously and quietly changing them to benefit Corporations instead of the Public) -- our country has fundamentally changed while the media and talking heads of our government have distracted us with war and terror while using it as an excuse for their actions.  Please take the time to examine the secrecy of the Bush Administration and how their policies HAVE and WILL continue to affect your life and supercede 200 years of jurisprudence and freedom.   NOW! with Bill Moyers - December 12, 2003  " Veil of Secrecy " - Collaborative Report  In "Veil of Secrecy," a NOW with Bill Moyers investigation with U.S. NEWS & WORLD REPORT, David Brancaccio examines the government’s actions to cut access to information about issues from toxic pollutants to airline and auto safety — leaving them hidden from public scrutiny.  In an era in which homeland security is imperative, government transparency has been diminished. Since 9/11, the report shows the federal government has blocked access to information that may protect the public's health and safety.             The results of U.S. NEWS' five-month  investigation into efforts to impose sweeping new secrecy requirements will be available on  USNews.com   beginning Saturday, Dec. 13 at 6 p.m.

       Fact of the Matt'er  Light  So i am going to try something new today. I will give you the headline (as i watch the evening news live) and then my reaction. It will be up to you to find more about the story if you're interested. Google's great for that.  HEADLINE: Student Fees at California Sate Universities will Rise at Least 10% next Year, Reducing Enrollment by 5%  COMMENT: When is the state or federal government going fund and guarantee our higher education? Until then, we're purposefully limiting knowledge to those with money. It's obscene. I still owe Texas $15,000 for my education, and it's enough to make me want to vomit. Send donations directly to me. --------  HEADLINE: Future Cleveland Indians Pitcher Says His Stint as Gay Porn Star was Mistake  COMMENT: What's his e-mail address?  --------  HEADLINE: $2 Million Buys 30 Seconds of Super Bowl Air Time  COMMENT: Only if CBS agrees with your message. (MoveOn.org)  --------  HEADLINE: Iraq Intelligence All Wrong Says Inspector DETAIL: "It turns out we were all wrong, in my judgement, and that is most disturbing." and "It is highly unlikely that there were large stockpiles of deployed chemical and biological weapons." - Kay  COMMENT: No shit. It's a little late for that now. Let's not let this administration get away with murder for money and revenge.  --------  HEADLINE: Everyone in America is Frozen  COMMENT: Your current WhiteHouse denies global climate change could be a result of global warming.  --------  HEADLINE: Dean is not a Crazy, Angry Madman Tapes Show DETAIL: His microphone was designed to block crowd noise -- so we heard him out of context. Mics in the crowd from EVERY OTHER camera show his speech was absolutely and unquestionably appropriate.  COMMENT: Why did it take the national media over a week to investigate this story when many of their anchors use the same microphones in crowds and can personally attest to the fact they can't even hear themselves talking over the noise -- yet their voices are perfectly clear to viewers at home. The media has stolen Dean's momentum, and they can never give it back. Shame on them.  --------  Okay, that's today, Wednesday, January 28, 2004.

      this last weekend i went on a lovely trip to  urlLink San Francisco  with Sam,  urlLink Cuong  and Darren. As you can see from the photos, it was quite an experience.  But then there's the fact that i got attcked on the streets of Castro by a disgruntled dude wearing all red. "What are you looking at, pale-ass bitch?" he posed right before he shoved me backwards.  Before i knew it, i had been punched in the face and head about four times by Mr. Red. Sam noticed i was under attack and came to my rescue, distracting Red long enough for me to catch my balance. Sam took a few blows to the face.  Then, Red's mysteriously cute accomplice who'd remained in the woodwork until now, tried to snatch my silver beanie from my head. It wasn't until that moment that i snapped into the reality that i was being attacked. Until then, it was a fast blur of confusion and disbelief.  I grabbed my hat from shaved-headed-gangster no.2 and was able to dodge and block a few punches and run away toward the crowd. I looked to find Sam and he was safe -- and he immediately got all of us into a cab to escape.  Because i was drunk with KettleOne and hopped on adrenaline, i was not in pain immediately. Sam, Darren, Coung and I all went back to our pad at Page&Pierce and drank a bit more and chatted out our experience.  The prescient irony ofo the entire situation is still unfolding, but i can already relay that my friend Brian Loftin in Dallas TX was composing an e-mail to me during the time of the attack. It was a narrative he unexplainably wanted to share with me about the time he was gay bashed in 2000. I was stunned to see that in my inbox the next morning.  More prominently was the fact that I asked Sam either the night before or during the day before the attack if he had ever been in a fist fight. My head had been filled with that vision -- remotely -- for a few days.   I've been consciously trying to improve my perception and recognition of the visions and feelings that i have ultimately identified as my intuition or psychic ability. this is a painful lesson that i should try harder.  the attack was compeletely random. unprovoked. it was not a gay bashing, i don't think, because these guys were seemingly gay. gangsters, but gay. yes, grandpa, those do exist.  so the next day i was sore and groggy, but blamed it on the vodka, not my soon-to-be diagnosed concussion. since the time of the attack at about 2 am Sunday morning, i've been dizzy, not myself and a bit confused.   I walked into my kitchen to grab a glass from the cupboard to for some water. instead of opening the cabinet, i tried instead to open my freezer door -- from the wrong side -- for about ten seconds. weird. and i had a witness.  I went to work Tuesday and was not feeling well at all. I had no patience and everyone was getting on my nerves. i also was very unrproductive, despite the fact there's so much to do. at the urging of my concerned boss and the director of my department, i took the last hour of work off and saw a doctor Wednesday at lunch.  He said my brain was still a bit swolen from the attack. My right side the worst from the points of hardest impact. The left side from when those blows bounced my brain from the left-lining of my brain. he said my dizziness and confusion could last up to six weeks.  my friends have been very supportive in this time of craziness. although it seems less crazy by the day. violence sucks.  i will be fine.

       BUSH VISITS TEXAS, RODEO   I bet you bastards are really happy about seeing your buddy George W. Bush at the rodeo today. It was a trip paid for by me and you (and the rest of tax-paying Americans) but it was obviously a stage for his re-election antics. It's really ridiculous. I don't know how he continues to get away with such blazon disregard for the law. Actually, I do. He created a climate that prohibits such inquiry. He squelches dissent using every piece of the government he can.  I think Kerry put it best when he said today on the campaign trail in Florida ... "If George Bush can find time to go to a rodeo, he can find more than an hour to spend with the commission investigating the September 11 attacks."  Arianna Huffington's column today outlined six things she believes John Kerry needs to know to be elected the 44th president. I got to know her when she helped to shape the recall election here in California. I would suggest you guys check it out. Simply click  here .  I think she's on to something. Americans  are  ready to be talked to as the responsible citizens we are. We deserve -- and are beginning to demand -- that the people in power acknowledge  our  reality.  Kerry is the best alternative to George W. Bush that we've got -- and he will be able to pull it off. If by some stroke of American idiocy Bush is re-elected, we're in a lot more trouble that we're gonna know how to deal with. For example, did you know the anti-terror forces of the government monitor my website (and thousands others) to make sure I am not trying to incite dissent? Well, I am not sure they do that, but these days, there's no way to tell.  Before the patriot act, even if they were monitoring this posting without my knowledge, it would be useless in any official proceeding unless the surveillance had been approved by a judge. But since Bush and Ashcroft have such a distaste for the judiciary, they've effectively managed to make them void in the process.  It's the same philosophy that guides the White House line on gay marriages -- put in place not by the will or vote of the people or their elected officials, but by what the GOP wants to call "activist judges." Is it not a concern if a president, with a questionable record in all sorts of affairs, to begin using executive privilege to dismantle the checks and balances of the courts? Where is this discussion?  Anyways, that's enough for now. I've got to get something for myself to eat this evening. You should also check out this link to inform yourself with critical information. It's from NOW with Bill Moyers from Friday's broadcast. They examine how the CIA and FBI are continually -- without justification -- infiltrating groups meeting to discuss views that are contrary to the Bush administration. Yes, unbelievable, I know! There's even documented evidence that says these "plants" have tried to incite the otherwise peaceful demonstrators into violence.  READ THIS .

       This is what my parents didn't want published in my hometown newspaper:   As a gay person growing up in Freeport, I was always ashamed. I kept my secret from everyone -- my parents, my closest friends and even myself. I prayed nightly for God to save me from what I had always been taught was a sin. It wasn't until I moved away to go to college in Austin that I realized I could be myself and live a normal, productive and fulfilling life like everyone else. Being gay, for the first time in my life, didn't matter to anyone.  That's why I was delighted to see your editorial in The Facts, which I read regularly online from my new home in West Hollywood, California. It's very important for the people of Brazoria County to know that gay and lesbian people are an important part of the community. By extending the same rights to these law abiding citizens that everyone else takes for granted, the community will be better served.  Logic and history tells us that the coupling of two loving people to establish a home and family is of great benefit to society. Denying these same rights to gay people -- who already have families and partnerships of equal value to their heterosexual counterparts -- is counterintuitive. Our families and relationships deserve the same protections and responsibilities as any other under the law.  I hope readers of The Facts will not succumb to the fear tactics being espoused by certain religious organizations that claim to speak for God. Gay marriage will not lead to polygamy. It will not lead to people marrying animals. It will not lead to the destruction of civilization as we know it. Just think about it.  As we continue this discussion as a nation -- and as a community -- let's be sure and remember that the debate is not in the abstract and theoretical -- it affects the everyday lives of millions in this country. There are human beings at the heart of this matter. The most patriotic thing we can do is embrace the Constitution in its true spirit and refuse to sit idly by when some in this country, at the expense of your fellow citizens, use it as a tool of discrimination.

It starts in a laboratory setting as two modelesque lab-coated scientists, (one male, one female) are looking at a super-closeup view of a a DNA double helix on a star-treck screen.  "What is it? It's growing ... " one of them exclaims as we go to an even tighter shot into the depths of the DNA -- a dark mass comes into focus as one of three Cadillac SUVs.  What's so eerily ironic about the whole ad is that studies have recently shown that complex carbon molecules from exhaust fumes ACTUALLY DO cling to DNA molecules in newborn babies, causing unknown harm and actually altering ... yes ALTERING the DNA.  Need I say more?

      Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney is doing all he can do keep non-Massachusetts couples from getting married in  his  state. The law he has now chosen to begin enforcing again after it lied dormant for dozens of years is from 1913. According to Aaron Brown's News Night on CNN, the original intent of the law was to keep interracial couples from "flocking to Massachusetts" to get married because it was illegal in their own state.  How can such a parallel of prejudice and institutionalized discrimination not serve as a concrete example of the idiocy behind this debate?

      It's almost silly to me that people don't realize what's going on right now and work actively to save this damn planet. A comprehensive 30-minute viewing of any network news broadcast could only leave one with the impression that things are FUCKED. And it's not too hard to connect the dots to see who's responsible for it.  Thing about it is, most Americans figure there are other people taking care of the problem. They see no vested interest in its solution, and if not immediately plagued by a situation's ill-effects, they are comfortable in denial. But there's a catch. Because this is a democracy, and WE are the people, it's our fault just as it is anyone's. History will tell that story.  It will speak of the most prosperous country in the World -- the global leader -- the SuperPower -- The United States of America -- and how it's citizenry failed to come to the earth's rescue when they were the only ones with the means to make it happen.  What were we doing instead? Well, for starters we were paying the highest price in history for gasoline -- that precious commodity made essential by those who produce it  -- while at the same time, the petroleum industry's profits are sufficient to fund the operating budgets of 2/3 of the earth's countries.  Secondly, we 're distracted by an amorphous "war on terror" in the wake of September 11, 2001. This initiative has provided the lubrication for a complete dismantling of foreign and domestic policy, an integration of church and state and empowered the FCC to protect "traditional values" with their censor button.  Distracting us further is the time it takes to make ends meet. Not elegantly and sashed with a bow, I am talking about simply feeding our families, buying energy, and relaxing ever so slightly. There's not much time for anything else.  Then we have our obsession with glitz, glamour and scandal. A few names come to mind: Martha Stewart, Michael Jackson, Scott Peterson. And then the political side shows of distraction: stirring the cauldron of homophobia with a proposed Constitutional amendment; Arnold Swartzenegger for Governor; Dean's Last Scream.  All the while, the world's going to shit. And we do nothing. Maybe it's because the media is scared to connect the dots for their consumers. Maybe their bosses won't let them since they're all owned by six people. Maybe Americans don't want to live in reality, rather in the "reality" we've all come to know -- the reality that is most palatable, most narcotic and requires the least thinking: that served by the media.  In any case, I, for one, will do my best to monitor the the missed opportunities of our generation as the world goes up in flames. And I will document it here. We're beyond the time when either George Bush or John Kerry can fix this huge mess. It will take most of us, and it may be bloody.

      "Outraged by the press and politicians and political agendas that are being served by this" says the Gentleman from Oklahoma.  "I would guess that these prisoners wake up every morning thanking Allah that Saddam isn't in control of this prison ... " "electric drills ... Vats of acid."   In other words, according to this guy, our torture is much nicer than Saddam's. What purpose does this line of rhetoric serve? We've all heard about Saddam violations -- right after we found no weapons of mass destruction. This doesn't make the abuse at the hands of Americans any more palatable.

      What went wrong, in plain English? "No training whatsoever" ... "Supervisory omission was rampant" Taguba tells the nation.  Okay this hearing with Taguba is truly captivating and revealing. Despite the fact that their linguistic escapades continue to evade the specific questions of exactly  who  was in charge at Al Graib, it's becoming evermore clear that the foot soldiers in this war in Iraq may have well been scooped off the streets of any suburb and thrown into the crossfire. It sounds to me like a bunch of 18-23 year olds were put in charge of all sorts of things in that prison (and who knows where else in Iraq.)   Amidst growing bipartisan agreement that the troop strength is dramatically insufficient to maintain control or even claim a verifiable victory, and a distinguished long-term Congressman saying on ABC's  Nightline  Monday that we need a draft to attain the critical mass of force needed in the "war on terror", this hearing will provide more than a look into that prison. Americans who pay attention will put the pieces together and finally begin to realize this quagmire for what it is -- and if we're lucky, begin to question why Bush isn't doing a better job.  Bush and Rumsfeld have a lot of explaining to do. I am delighted the World is watching, because they tend to use the necessary skepticism when consuming the rhetoric of the United States government. More to come, I am certain.

      I was proud of Kerry and the Democrats at the close of the convention tonight. They have really managed to awaken my doubtful optimism over the last few days. Americans will thrive if our confidence is restored and our credibility addressed. We can do better. See ya, W!

       I bit the bullet and did laundry today. It had been way too long. But the fun part, as you will see, is that i got to play with my new picture phonen while i was there -- which enables me to bring my adventures to you in a new enhanced way! I know you will be checking back here with more frequency now, for sure.  As you can see, there's a lot more happening at the corner of santa monica blvd. and genesee than laundry. the ol' golden rule liquor store always proves to be the perfect place for anything you may need. the cashier there has three teeth but is jolly as all hell. maybe it's all the liquor behind him, maybe it's the fact that he just doesn't give a damn. i will have to take a snap shot of him to share with you later.   I also picked up a bottle of Fiji water while i was there. It's so damn tasty i can hardly stand it. They bottle it over by Fiji, of course, and accordingn to the bottle, there's a reason for that.  "The origin of FIJI water is rainfall, which over decades filters into an aquifer deep beneath volcanic highlands and pristine tropical forrest on the main island of Viti Levu in Fiji. Separated by over 1,500 miles of the open Pacific from the nearest continent, this virgin ecosystem protects one of the purest waters in the world.    Thirsty? I was. But the adventures don't stop there. There are always a variety of intersting folks hanging out at the laundromat. This family, for example, arrived during my first smoke break. I took this photo without their knowledge. I think that may be illegal, but maybe not.    Anyhow, what i didn't see at first was the fact that they had brought their pet with them. A Bird! He was very well trained -- or at least keenly aware that his wings had been clipped and he was not flying  anywhere . AND he didn't shit on anyone while he was there.   And another thing i find peticularly peculiar -- in a wierd double entendre sort of way. The names of the washers and dryers remind me of a few of my druggie friends. This would make a good inside joke in a gay film. You read it hear first. You speed queen, you.   Come to think of it, doing laundry is not such a bad thing. I think what sucks the most for me is that i have to pack all my dirtly clothes into my car and drive to the damn place, then pack them up and bring them home. I used to have a washer and dryer when I lived in Texas. Then i gave it to my brother who lived in austin -- and when he came home to live with mommy and daddy again while he teaches at the very high school from which i graduated, they sit unused in the garage.   Anyhow, i need to hop in the shower and head over to a friend's place to stay the night. Then tomorrow it's off to Sam's house for poolside cocktails and rooftop firework viewing. Oh, America. Come back! Come back!

      It's been a while since I've posted here. I've been really busy with work and  GLAAD 's "I DO" campaign. I encourage you all to check out  IDOin30Seconds.org  next time you need a breather at work. We received over 80 entries from brilliant filmmakers across the country. It's well worth your time -- and your donation if you can afford it.  On another front, in the wake of the public delight in  Michael Moore 's Fahrenheit 9/11, my friend  Laura Martin  has created a brilliant, non-violent call to arms that I want all of you to   download ASAP  . It's called  One by One  and you should tell all your friends and family about it. If you know anyone in the recording industry or any socially conscious DJ's who wouldn't be afraid to put these in their mix, please encourage them to do so. The time is now. Bloggers, please link as well.  Those two links should keep you busy for a while. Talk to you all soon.

       Today's Los Angeles "smog" is out of control! You can usually at least see downtown from this vantage point. Please, oh please, buy a hybrid vehicle. Carpool. Ride MTA.   It's so easy for us to forget that we're surrounded by gorgeous mountains, the coast -- and the hollywood sign. All invisible today. How very, very sad.

       I filled up my tank this morning -- since it's just days after payday, i can afford to do so. I was pleasantly surprised by the LOWEST GAS PRICES this season! I was able to fill up my entire tank for the low, low cost of $27.48! Just for reference, when i lived in Texas two years ago, I could fill up for less than $16.     I went to check out Matt's new condo today during my lunch hour. There's a good chance i may move in there with him at the  beginning of September. I have to spend some time with the schematics and floorplan before i make my final decision, but there's one thing going in my favor: the address is 1222. How appropriate. But regardless, on the way over there today I saw this car. I am sure many of you locals have seen Mr. Woodruff's movie mobile roaving around town. Only in Hollywood. Or in this case, West Hollywood. Hooray!

       As Bush worked to provide the vaporware implementation of 9/11 Commissioners' reccomendation to have a national director of intelligence, he addressed questions of this person's authority and accountability with the following:  "Well, I don't think the person ought to be a member of my cabinet. I will hire the person and I can fire the person, which is - any president would like. I'll tell you, that's how you have accountability in government."  - George W. Bush    NYT .   I am just curious why this is not getting more play -- not in the context of the current creation of an 'intelligence czar' -- but in the innumerable failures in Iraq, Afghanistan, and the Homeland. There's been no accountability. No one has been "fired." I suppose it's up to all of us to fire Mr. Bush in November.

       urlLink  LISTEN TO MY DRIVE    Sundays are always ... well, the day before you start your week. I've layed in bed on several occasions on such Sunday nights -- psychicing myself up for the comng week. I've tried to quit smoking that way. It didn't [doesn't] work. Sunday's kinda like mardis gras for the mundane. one last hurrah before you re- lent -lessly slave away the week for the [wo]man.  I only bring this up because i often find myself at  Taco Bell  on Sunday more than any other day. I think it's because i tell myself i will go grocery shopping on Monday. And then, of course, since I am already out&about, i may as well stop in at the trusty  7-11 .   I had been watching the  Food Network  all day long -- all about ice cream, gelato [and hunky men making gelato]. So I was awfully tempted by the  Ben & Jerry's . But i decided against it. Nothing against Ben or Jerry -- but I had just finished off a double decker taco supreme and nacho bell grande.  But since my shins and cavs were begining to lactate from my hike up Runyan, i couldn't pass up  all  the sweets! Maybe one of these tasty treats? Nah, I don't want any of that either. I think i will just pick up one of my favorites -- and what mom used to serve us for breakfast --  Hostess Cupcakes .    That being said -- and such things purchased -- all that's left is catching Six Feet Under tonight. Chun's on his way over to catch it (if he can make it back from the valley in time.) Matt's a  SFU  expert. Then, all I have to worry about tomorrow is buying some gas. Damn, that shit is pricey these days.

      I walked up this mountain the other day on the Runyan Canyon trails. Aside from the thick smog and occasional whifts of dog shit, i was able to make it -- without heart failure -- which surprised  Chun .  What you can't see in the not-so-distance is the rest of Los Angeles.     Here's a shot I took of Chun and  Stevo .     Maybe next time i'll have more time to take some interesting photos. Until then, here are these clasics from last weekend --- our little adventure at the  Parlour Club . it was "twenties" night -- as in 1920's.  From the looks of things, the fuel for our time machine was mostly VODKA.  But -- i must say -- i stumbled across a new weight loss craze that i will soon send to production: Sweatin' to the 2o's"   Sam , for example, slammed this drink down in no time flat.    And moments later, he looked like this:     Darren  was also there -- and in the darkness:    But regardless, we had a good time. Tonight -- SIX FEET UNDER. Lates.
