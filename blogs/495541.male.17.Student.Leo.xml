      So I end up being unsucessful with my idea of making my blog and my site the same design.  That's too bad.  I like this current design though.  I'll keep it until I can get the old idea working, maybe.  I think I'm going to go do my homework now.  I don't have anything to do, so I should get it over with.

      Right now, I'm messing around with the template file on this blog.  I'm trying to get it to look exactly like my personal site found  urlLink here .  We'll see how it comes out.

      I'm so mad now.  I just got done writing so much on things I rememberd and whatnot and I went to hit post and lost it all.  I'm so disappointed in BLOGGER right now.  I'm going to go cry now.

      To begin this m...  That's when my sister, in her bed started in on me about being up so early and how she wanted me to stop.  So, needless to say I did.  To begin this morning I want to talk about the dreams I had the last few days.  Just last night, I dreamt about being, of all things, an astronaunt.  It was a very weird dream (but dreams are normally weird), I'd say.  It began, as far back as I can remember, with me inside the space shuttle.  It wasn't exactly the space shuttle though, from the inside.  In the inside, it looked more like a bus.  Then, as we landed in Dallas, I think as I rememberd the flight attendant say something about Dallas faintly.  We then oddly got on a bus, but before actually getting on the bus I didn't know it was a bus.  I first thought it was the actual shuttle I would take off on.  It had that astronaunt like walkway in front of it, just like the real shuttles have, I think.  It was weird.  Then, after getting off this bus, I went in my parents car and that's when I woke up.  A very weird dream.  I never thought anything about being an astronaunt one bit.  The other dream I want to talk about, I had Saturday night.  This, to date, is the weirdest dream I have ever had.  All I can really remember about this dream is that it was in the desert and the main thing of the dream was that we (who else, I don't know) drove around the desert on a road and frequently stopped and someway loaded this cart of creamfilled hotpockets in a cart.  It was the grossest thing ever.  To this day, I have this nasty taste of just biting into a dozen of those stupid creamfilled things just like a Hostess (sp?) cake snack.  That's really sickening.  It makes me wonder what's going on inside my head.  Today marks the first day of the brand new trimester at school.  I hope to get off to a good start.  Previously I have slacked off a lot and have not really cared much about school and with the new trimester I hope to change this.  I really do hope.  I aim at making a consious effort to keep good grades.  I'm not sure at all if I am going to actually get good grades, but I figure I should give it a try.  Who knows what could happen.  I could actually get good grades.  I believe that I have the capability to get good grades, it's just that I don't want it that bad.  I guess it had never meant that much to me to open the report card and see the fruit of hard labor.  I never really cared about good fruit.  So, I suppose you could say I'm now going for some good fruit this season.  That's all for now.  Have a good day.

      I, at the moment, am currently going against the word of my mother.  I say this because if you read the last entry, you would know my mom told me to stay off the computer on Sunday and today is Sunday.  So I tell you this because I think you should know.  I think I'm addicted to using the computer.  It's either that or I just find it to be much more entertaining than sitting in front of the television.  Whatever the case, it's caused me to go against my mother.  So there you have it, I'm a sinner and you know because I've admitted it.  Sometimes I just hate the things I do, but after, I have no idea why I did them.  I think, what could have possibly caused me to be so horrible at that point in time.  I can honestly tell you most of the time, I can never figure it out.  It would be as if I had lost my mind completely at the time.  I'm not sure what I'm saying is completely true or sane for that matter.  I can only assure you of one thing... the things that end up in this blog come only from one person and that person is me.  That's all for now, I suppose.  Good night.

      This is my first post on my brand new blog.  In this blog, I hope to talk about whatever in my life I am currently doing, experiencing, and thinking about.  I'm pretty sure it will be interesting, so don't worry about this being boring.  And as an informational note, I plan to make these posts as frequently as possible and as long as I can.  By long, I mean describe things as well as I can, and in a way that things and ideas are vivid and easy to understand.  This maybe pose to be difficult for me because I am not a very good writer, but I hope to have fun with this blog.  One main thing I hope to have at this blog is actual visitors.  It would be nice to get feedback from people on things I talk about.  That would be great, but to start out, I won't expect much as far as visitors.  This is a new blog, anyways.  I think I have talked enough about my blog and I should probably get on to actual blogging.  To start out tonight, I wanted to talk about the subject of woment and relationships.  I must honestly say that I do not have much experience in the field of relationships and women as I have only had one girlfiriend.  But I can honestly say by this, I have learned a lot.  Now, when I talk of women now, I'm not going to talk about women as if the things I describe are attributes of all women.  That would be hard to believe, since I do not have much experience to speak from.  That though, does not keep me from forming my own opinions about the subject of women.  I would probably tell you that most of my opinions tend to depend on my current mood.  Heh.  That would be true though.  But one could say what doesn't depend on your current mood?  That I cannot answer because I think opinions you form cannot go without consideration of your current mood.  And look at how much I have said without actually telling you what my opinion is on women.  I don't really want to begin to tell of my opinion on the subject because I am afraid to put something in stone.  I don't want to say something then a minute later change my mind.  With that said, I think it may be a while before I actually form an opinion.  Either that, or one day I'll be so moody I'll just want to rant and rave it all out in a short span of time so fast I won't be able to stop myself.  Heh.  That's enough for now, I think.  Next update will probably be on Monday.  I am not allowed to be on the computer on Sunday because of my mother's request.  I don't know why exactly though.  She just said it would be a good idea to give something up for a while.  That makes sense but I just got off restriction from the computer for three weeks.  I think she should probably be leanient and let me be on 24/7 if I wanted.  But oh well, that's just my opinion.  Good night.

      Blogger is starting to make me very mad.  It happened again.  I wrote up an update thinger and it gave me an error.  How nice of Blogger.  I just have to remember to copy it before post.  Just to make sure it doesn't mess up.  That annoys me so much because all this effort and thought goes into something only for it to be erased in an instant.  That is so annoying you cannot understand.  Well I've been thinking about wanting to get a laptop computer.  I'd really like one.  They're expensive but it would be so handy.  I could put it in my room.  Whenever I have an idea, I'm spoiled enough to not want to write it down.  I always prefer to type my thoughts because I can type much faster and no matter what way I type, my type writing comes out the same according to the font.  So that's the main reason why I like the computer over writing.  That's not so say that I don't do writing.  I do a lot.  In fact I do have a journal I write in, but lately I have not.  I'd like to just be able to lay in bed, with a laptop and type and type and type.  I did it for a while when my sister sent her old laptop home for me to fix it.  It was awesome.  I'd think of things so productive it'd amaze you.  It amazed me.  I'd reread it and say, is that my typing?  It also brings so much truth too.  It was about a month period I used it and there's so much stuff that just kills me.  I mean the kind of stuff that's just straight out, no BS type stuff.  I'd just plain out say what I had to say and it'd be great.  So that's why I want a laptop so bad.  It would also be nice to have it hooked up to the internet.  Better yet wireless networed.  That might be pushing it though.  Wireless networks are expensive.  My Dad said he might be able to hook me up with something at work, so we'll just have to wait and see.  Tonight I played intermural basketball.  I actually played on two teams.  I hadn't even signed up with either of the teams.  I just played.  I played pretty good too, I think.  I'm oddly pretty sore from that.  Maybe it's just from the lifting.  I think so.  I don't know if I have lifting tomorrow but I'm not going to go.  Bob said that they'd start to expect (or something along the line) us to be lifting and isometrics next week.  So I don't know but I don't want to go lifting tomorrow, I'm sore.  What else?  I don't know I keep thinking.  Thinking about someone... a lot.  Most of the people I know best would know who I'm talking about but this is killing me.  Instead of listening to raging rock music, I find myself listening to slow tempo you-don't-love-me-ish music.  If you can get at what I'm saying.  Music like Coldplay, DMB, Jack Johnson just to name a few.  I love their music, but it's quite depressing at times.  To let you know, I was going to just type something incredibly funny to end on a funny note, but I can't let it happen.  I'm not going to allow myself to be mocked.  Ha!  Good night.

        So I was walking home today and I was walking along the sidewalk.  While walking home, I always notice the cars that pass me by and today a car stopped and a guy got out, except the guy in the car behind him didn't stop and went to the right of him.  I'm guessing it was pretty close because the guy stopped backed up and started yelling obscenities out the window, though I don't believe the guy heard him.  I thought there might be a fight or something.  The guys in the car were pretty mad.  Kind of weird to witness, but not as weird as seeing an accient.  I saw one a few months ago.  This morning, I went in early to do some lifting.  Fontana and my Dad talked a while last night about this stuff.  I'm supposed to be in the weight room all the time and what not.  Basically saying, if you want to relax, go out for a spring sport.  Coaches don't know when to go away.  I can understand over the summer or before the season but right after the season's over?  I would expect at least a month or so to just relax.  Apparently they want us to get in there and get 'the edge' on the competition.  Meanwhile, I get about 6 hours of sleep because they want us in there at the crack of dawn.  I go to bed at about ten but I never fall asleep until about 11:30 or most of the time later.  Also, I offen wake up at 4 for no reason.  An odd thing it is.  'Til later.

      Has insomnia gotten the best of me?  No.  Preoccupied with thoughts of someone.  :-(  It's a sad story that won't be told on this day.  Good night, I hope.

      Went to Best Buy today and bought the latest Incubus album.  I've listened to the songs for quite sometime on my computer, but I think it's a great CD so I bought it.  I like having the CD.  It also supports the artists.  I think Incubus is great, so I want them to keep making music.  No better way to support them then buying their album.  So that's just what I did.  I like a lot of songs on the CD.  One of my favorites is "Aqueous Transmission."  It's a slow song, real good though.  Something you can easily fall asleep listening to, if you have the bass down on your headphones/speakers.  I was thinking about getting the tool album, Ænima, but I didn't like the thought of having a 'parental' CD.  I think that I've given up on the idea to make my page and blog the same layout.  I don't really feel like messing with it enough to try to get it to work.  What I really wanted to do was get the archive address so I could put it on my archive page, on my site, but I can't.  It uses a tag for the archive address.  Thatway they can rename the address on the fly, and keep it working.  I don't have to worry because I'm not going to mess with it anymore.  I just don't feel like it.  Not really worth the effort, I think.  I do though, want to continue to update my site.  I plan on adding a research section.  I'll put, obviously research stuff.  Bed time.

      This is my blog update from last night.  I would have posted it yesterday, but Blogger was down:  This is my first update from any location other than my personal computer.  I am on my Mom's at the moment.  It's pretty old.  It's a Compaq Presario 2266.  Not really all that fast, but it's good for e-mail.  It's got a record uptime of over 6 weeks.  That's running Windows 98.  That's pretty amazing.  I even run my Genome@home program on it.  That gets a few work units done for my team.  As I look right now, it's about to finish a gene.  I'm ranted about 220 or so on the teams list.  That's not bad.  My computers in the lead on my team with about 230 genes I believe.  This computer has 60 or something I think.  Not bad.  My Dad also has his laptop hooked up to it.  He's got around 100 genes, I believe.  That's pretty cool.  I'm not sure what it's really doing, but it's cool to actually use the idle time of a computer for something.  Today I actually wrote some in my personal journal.  It was pretty weird after not writing in it in some time.  It's really interesting to read over what I had previously wrote in that journal.  I can really tell that I'm progressing in though and mental capasity.  It's clearly reflected in the writing.  Either that, or I'm just getting more mature.  I don't know.  Probably a combination of both, but no one can clearly tell.  Anyways, I was playing Counter-Strike as I said earlier.  That's a pretty fun game.  Not exactly all that fun when you play with people that are so good.  It may be that I am not skilled at the game or it's just that I haven't played in such a long time.  I can't tell yet.  I'll probably continue to play on the new server.  I know a couple of people from the clan so it's fun having a server to play on.  I'm going to see if I can get them to get one of my favorite maps, Jeepathon 6k.  Not many people like it but I used to play on it all the time back on the Nude clan servers.  That was great.  They used to play all kinds of crazy maps.  It was almost as if they wern't looking to be competative, but just to have fun.  Couple more days and it will be spring break.  I'm not sure what I will do durring the break.  I hope that whatever I do that it's productive in some way.  I know Christmas break, all I did was sit around all day and use the computer.  Now what sense does that make?  Not only does that rot my brain, but I get nothing done.  I'd really like to work on Halbe.org.  I've got a PHP book that I want to read and learn a bit of PHP for the new site.  I'm kind of wondering though, because I don't believe my host supports PHP.  Ultimatly, what I would want to do is host myself at my Dad's work.  They have a T1 line, I believe.  I'm sure they'd let me tap into it.  You may be thinking that that's not a good idea, but you just don't know they kind of IT guy my Dad works with.  He's a train smoker and he basically does nothing all day from what I hear.  He'd probably help me set it up.  I also wanted to run a my own Counter-Strike server, but I guess there's no need for that now that Counter Assassins have one.  I'd still like to know what it wold be like to completely control somthing.  It's just a power thing.  People always like to be in control of things.  I guess I have some of that in me.  I suppose I should just trust others a bit and just see how it is.  I don't know.  I probably won't get anything done durring the breat, but it makes no sense in just saying blah I'll be lazy.  I'm going to  try  to do something productive and just see how the whole break goes.  Well I really can't think of much more to say tonight.  I think I'm going to go to be now and listen to my Coldplay CD.  Good night.

      So I ened up getting very little sleep last night.  When I did get up, I took a quick shower thinking it would help wake me up.  It worked pretty well.  I should have tried a cold shower.  That would have done a lot better, I think.  Whatever would help.  Coffee would help but I don't like coffee.  It tastes like dirt.  I had some cold coffee once, I wanted to puke it up.  Made me do that shiver thing when you taste something that just is so bad.  So a couple days ago I started this thing in my profile called page two.  I'm not sure what I'm going to be putting into it.  Anything really.  I'm just waiting for someone to suggest something.  I just added a song of the moment thing.  That probably won't last long.  Too hard to update.  I'm going to go play some Counter-Strike on the new Counter Assassins server.  Until later.

      Figures.  I can't sleep again.  I went to bed at about 10:20 or so and started to listen to my Coldplay CD.  When I got to about the 4th track, my CD player began to speed up the playback and I had to turn it off and back on.  Kind of weird.  Maybe I'll call tech support about it.  Or I probably won't.  Anywas, I listened to the whole CD and then a few tracks over again.  I really like that CD.  Makes me want to buy more Coldplay stuff, but most of it is not available in stores.  You have to buy it online and most of it is imported so that makes it twice the price.  They only have one full length album and so everything else is EPs with about 3 or so tracks.  Kind of annoying.  It may just be the sheets on my bed, but lately I can't sleep.  It's not that there's a lot going on.  I'm not in any sports of any sort this term.  Generally when you try to go to sleep, you just wonder about thinking about anything at all, but I always think about the same thing.  I can never fall asleep thinking about it either.  Maybe I'll change my sheets and see how that works.

      I'm going to start doing a song of the day thing.  Title, who it's by and what album.  Cool?  Today's song of the day is: Coldplay - "Don't Panic" from their 2000 release "Parachutes"  Excellent song.  It really sounds great but it's sort of short at only 2 minutes and 16 seconds.  If you get the album, you'll really like it, believe me.  Popular songs on the CD include "Shiver", "Yellow" and "Trouble."  Later.

      Yesterday was fun.  Got to play some basketball with  urlLink Ashley   .  That was fun.  I beat her so bad though.  It wasn't even funny.  She's always saying that she can beat me.. wow... pure ownage.  What else is going on?  Not much really.  Download  urlLink this  MP3 of Arnold's pizza shop (language).  It's hilarious.  Anyways, I don't know what I'm going to do today.  Hopefully get a haircut.  It's been quite some time since my last visit and I'm getting a little shaggy up there.  That's about it for now.  Later folks.

      So tonight was fun.  I hardly remember the rest of the day.  It went by so fast.  We stayed up all night.  Durring around 6 or 7 AM, Chase and Brett fell asleep.  That kind of sucked.  I was kind of left alone to do nothing.  I messed around with the network and got it working with the two computers.  That's when I last posted.  After that, I went to bed for a couple hours.  I don't remember well what happened.  I went upstairs layed down.  It didn't seem like I was that tired.  I didn't feel tired, for that matter.  I just dozed off and later I wake up about 4 or  5 hours later.  By that time, I find Chase and Brett on both computers.  Neither want to give them up.  Chase's computer still broke meantime.  Some error like  urlLink unmountable_boot_volume .  We didn't get it fixed either.  I figured he probably messed something up on the XP install.  He said he'd gotten the same error before since he got the upgrade.  I figured he didn't change the drive to NTFS and just left it to FAT32.  The Microsoft page said it might have had something to do with disk optimizations.  He didn't have any on, to my knowledge.  They also said to disable a couple things in the BIOS.  Nothing worked.  I think he actually made it worse by loading a factory default of something.  For some reason doing that almost always messes something up.  He's just going to have to go get it fixed by someone who wants to spend time on it.  :-X  Turns out Karl didn't leave  urlLink C/A .  It's probably a good thing he didn't.  We also downsized the clan.  We've only got 11 guys now.  I also was promoted to Major, which is so ubber leet.  Not sure how that's any different from the below ranks as far as power, but isn't it just cool to have that title.  Major Halbe... for some reason taht doesn't sound right.  I'm liking the sound of General Halbe.  Really doesn't matter.  They're getting a nice T1 server too.  That should be nice.  I hope it gets big.  The last server we had never had anyone in it.  It would be much nicer to have so many people like  urlLink edu .  That's all for now. :-)  Good night.

      Well last night, I had a LAN party.  To be honest, it didn't turn out to be a LAN party like I expected.  For starters, only two people showed up.  That's not a LAN party.  Second, we couldn't get the computers networked.  How convient?  Chase was running XP, Brett on 98 and me on 2000.  Three different operating systems.  Chase fired up his computer and messed with the bios and fried his stuff.  He couldn't use his computer for the rest of the night.  To this point, it still doesn't work.  Brett got his working, but we had to share the internet connection.  We'd yell at each other to get some time and we'd switch off every now and then.  It turned out horrible.  We bought pizza, chips, soda the whole 9-yards but nothing turned out right.  I suppose I should have planned ahead and maybe learned a bit or two about networking.  Karl was supposed to come.  He took LAN class, so he could probably have hooked it up.  He didn't show.  What's even better is that he quit our clan, C/A.  He joined another and basically abandoned us.  He claimed he'd still help us but I doubt that.  Meanwhile, Brendon is taking over for Wags(Karl).  We'll just see how that goes.  I have confidence in Brendon.  He's the guy who's setting up our T1 server, so not much to be said.  So pretty much last night went pretty crappy for me.  :-(  This morning though, I got Brett's and my computer hooked up.  Found out that I forgot about @Home and MediaCom switch.  I put '@Home' as the network group instead of the MediaCom one.  I'm glad I figured it out now.  Hopefully we'll get to play some games before the guys go home.  That's about it.

      So I sat down for a few minutes just playing around with Adobe Photoshop.  What I wanted to do was create a cool desktop wallpaper for myself.  I was just messing around with the filters and various options.  I really don't know much about Photoshop.  I really wish I was better with it.  Problem is that making images is not easy with limited skill and no ideas for what to create.  I really admire those making very abstract art with the computer... it's amazing.  I see many tutorials on how to make one thing or two.  The odd thing is that these images contain so much detail.  I'm not sure if I could ever learn, but I really want to.  What else is going on?  Well I joined a Counter-Strike clan.  It's called  urlLink Counter-Assassins .  My two good friends created the clan, so I think that's the only reason I got in.  I highly doubt I'll be in many matches.  They've got two teams with 10 or so, I think, on each.  They just had a match tonight and won.  No one even told me about it.  Oh well.  It's just cool to have the tag in front of your player name :-D  Anything else?  Yeah, I've been doing some updating my site quite a bit.  I'm thinking of a new design.  Not sure what it will be.  While back, I was messing with CSS.  The program I was using was pretty nice.  One problem with it is that it had all tags, correct and incorrect according to the WC3.  One of the major things I want to be sure of is that my new design is WC3 compadable.  I want it to look perfect in all browsers.  I don't want it to be your average only-working-in-Internet-Explorer type page.  Those are quite annoying.  Until later.

      So spring break is here.  I can't say that I've done all that much.  If you count all the videos I've downloaded and watched then that's great.  I downloaded about 15 full Seinfeld episodes fom kazaa.  The FBI will probably show up and take me to prison.  I hope not.  I just like my Seinfeld.  I don't like to wait to when they play the repeats on TV.  So I stayed up until about 5 AM watching those episodes.  It was crazy.  Tomorrow I believe I will be going to work with my Dad.  I'm not sure why.  Well I do know why.  Partially because I stayed up so late.  Once on Friday then Saturday.  I don't know why.  I should probably go to be right now.  In fact I will.  Good night.

      This world is harsh.  What we really do need in this world is more love.  There’s no reason why we shouldn’t love one another.  By this, I don’t mean physically, but I mean love as a neighbor.  People on earth are faced with many things.  We must work to earn an income.  We must earn an income to buy food to eat.  We must buy food to eat so that we don’t die of starvation.  We are forced to do this in order to stay alive.  Meanwhile we are also faced with other things, not only physically but emotionally as well.  We all need to feel acceptance.  We all need to feel love.  We all need something.  You could not live in the middle of no where, isolated with no one to comfort you.  You would become extremely depressed.  You would go crazy.  The main problem in our current world is that the focus is put on us.  We are not concerned with one another, but with ourselves.  We are not asked to help anyone.  We are not forced to help anyone.  We are not obligated to donate a kidney if someone dying is in need of one.  In this country, you can deny someone their life by not giving them it.  No one in the United States could put you in jail.  No one could legally punish you.  Ethics, manners, the right thing, and morality are not enforced.  No one asks you to do what is right; they tell you do to what you want.  Thus making everything in your life optional and making everything ever more hard.  Nothing of morality is mandatory.  You just have to follow the law and not deny anyone their right to choose their options.  That in turn, is what makes the United States the United States.  We’re a huge country of diversity.  We’re also number one in crime and many other horrible statistics.  A country with so much freedom leads to a country with so many problems.  That is not to say that freedom means problems, it only leads to them.  We should have freedom; we should just use it in the right way.  The right way is not on the law books.  Therefore, anything goes.  I hope and pray this country will make a turn around.  We’ve seen some progress since the day of September 11, 2001.  Everyone has heard the story.  We know what happened.  I just pray that we’d all come together and do what’s right.  I don’t know how we can, but I just want the evil to stop.  I’ve had enough of it in my life as it is.  I’m sick of it.  I’m sick of the sarcastic remarks.  I’m sick of the mom jokes.  I’m sick of the drug dealers.  I’m sick of the rapists.  I’m sick of the murders.  I’m sick of the bad.  I’m sick of it, but the word hate will never come from my lips.  Fighting fire with fire doesn’t work.  If you’ve tried, you would know.  As you poor more flames on the fire, it elevates and devours anything in its path.  People as well.  Innocent people.  We need to do something.  I want this to be a better world.  Don’t you?  Do you want hate to continue?  Goodnight.

      Earlier Blogger went down.  I couldn't post today's song, so I'll do that now.  Today's song of the day:  "Lateralus" by Tool, from the album, Lateralus (2001).  This is the title track on their latest album.  The song comes in at a little under 10 minutes long.  I really like this song.

      It seems to me like things are getting worse.  I can’t seem to get myself on track of anything.  My problem may be that I really don’t care that much.  It also may be that I like the way things are.  I doubt it’s the second, because I know I hate being like this.  It’s my fault, I’m pretty sure.  I doubt there’s anyone I could blame.  The fact is that people themselves determine the way they feel and how much they let something affect them.  Regardless of what people say.  You have the power to determine how much something affects you.  That is the truth.  There may be a possibility when something can be hard to control, but you always have the option to remove yourself from the situation.  For example if you were watching a graphic movie, and were afraid of the effects it may have on you, you could easily leave the theater, or stop watching.  It’s just your own fault if you don’t remove yourself simply because you’re afraid of looking weird.  I know my parents walk out of movies all the time because they think they’re horrible.  A lot of movies now days have pretty graphic crap in them.  The problem is that we’ve gotten so used to being subjected to them.  The question of whether something causes harm to you is a whole other debate.  That’s something that’s probably harder to find out.  I have to hear from my Mom telling me that I’m going to turn into a raging killer whenever I play a video game that involves guns or killing.  It’s pretty annoying, if you asked me.  I know that once I get talking about something, I can really go on and on about nothing important.  I don’t really care though.  I’m just thinking out loud.  What’s been going on in my life?  Well this weekend, I believe I will be participating in a basketball tournament.  I have no idea when and where exactly.  All I know is that it will be with a bunch of guys from Kennedy (my school).  We had a practice last Sunday.  It’s not technically a practice because that’s not allowed.  It’s ‘optional’ they say.  Sure.  The same goes with the morning workouts and the weight lifting.  They’re completely optional, but ‘it would be a good idea’ somehow turns into ‘you need to be’ real easily.  When will we ever have time to relax?  Do the coaches know how stressful it can be to be a teenager?  I don’t think they care that much, to be honest.  They don’t want to, either I think.  It would probably make us weak.  Lately, I haven’t been feeling well.  Currently, I have a bad problem with my throat.  It’s probably nothing major, but it is a pain in the ass.  It’s hard for me to believe that I have a problem with my throat.  I eat so many oranges all the time.  Vitamin C does prevent soar throats, right?  Probably not, that’s why.  I’ve been making the habit of putting a song of the day every time I post something.  This post is not an exception.  The song of the day is:  “Porcelain” by Moby.  It comes of his last album “Play” I highly doubt that you haven’t heard the song.  It’s on many commercial advertisements.  Pretty much the whole album has been on advertisements.

      I wish things were much clearer than they are to me.  Whatever happens, I don’t really understand.  I never even get most of what happens.  Things happen so fast.  I’m too lazy to even plan ahead for things.  I always wait until the last minute to actually do something.  At times like that I want to scream.  At times, nothing makes sense.  Now it seems like more and more of the time it feels like this.  I don’t get it.  I wish I could trigger something that would make me better.  I want to care more about things.  Whenever I feel that way, I just don’t care.  It’s the only way that I can feel OK at all.  Otherwise I’m worried about my problems.  I’ve found that lately, I’ve been thinking about things that are quite mindless.  Mainly, I think because I can’t do much of anything else.  When you have so much on your mind, you can’t think.  The last couple weeks have been bad for me.  I really lack consistency in my life.  I seem to have mood swings quite a bit.  I’m on top of the world then not even close a couple hours later.  I’m not sure what to make of it.  That combined with my schedule and homework makes things horrible.   It seems like I’m always doing something for basketball whether I want to or not, during the season and off-season.  In that time, when do I get a break?  I never seem to get enough sleep.  Having to get up at 6 for work in the gym in the morning is not very fun.  And the change in time makes it an hour worse.  ‘ I am just a worthless liar. I am just an imbecile. I will only complicate you. Trust in me and fall as well. I will find a center in you. I will chew it up and leave, I will work to elevate you Just enough to bring you down. ’ (Tool – Sober)  Seems almost like everything is trying to elevate me in a way then right after bring me down to a state of depression.  I doubt it’s on purpose, but it seems that way.  Nonetheless it’s probably the cause of my depression.  Sometimes I wish I could have silence.  Utter complete silence.  Just to rest in peace for a moment or two without thinking.  I doubt that is possible.  I wish it were.  Then maybe I would feel a bit better after waking up.  The following is some lyrics from the song I think is today’s song of the day.  It’s “The Patient” by Tool:  ‘ Be patient. I must keep reminding myself of this.  And if there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through This tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would've walked away by now. And I still may.  Gonna wait it out. ’

      To put it simply, my weekend sucked.  How else could I put it?  I don't know.  Things just haven't been going that well for me lately.  I'm not sure what I can do about it.  Things just seem to be extremely boring, or depressing.  That makes for some pretty sad moods.  I've been playing a lot of basketball lately.  Oddly enough for it being in the off-season.  I don't like the idea of having that sort of thing in the off-season.  I honesly don't care that much about being competative.  People are now putting too much importance on winning games.  Forget 'having fun' it's about winning.  So you've got conditioning, weigh-lifting, non-practice practices (practice in the off-season is against the rules).  Everything.  I'm getting pretty tired of it.  It could just be due to the fact that lately I'm not really in good moods, but I just don't get much joy in playing when all this is involved.  It gets to be a big bug when you get reminded to go to these 'optional' off-season workout things all the time.  Like I've said before, they're really not optional.  If you never go to them, you have low chances of actually getting to play.  That's wrong I think.  No one cares about my opinion.  It's all about competition.  While staying on the subject of basketball, Saturday a few 9th/10th players and I went to a tournament in Dubuque.  We ened up winning our first game by pretty much a blow out.  We won by 20 or so, if I remember correctly.  The second game we did great in the first half.  Going up against a tough Linn-Mar team, we got beat by 20 or so.  It was a pretty bad second half.  I'm not really mad about it at all.  I really don't care.  Today's song of the day is: "Over" by A Perfect Circle from their first album, Mer De Noms.  It's a pretty good album, I think.  With exception for a few tracks I don't like.  That's all for tonight.  I need to go to bed.  Good night.

      Just a simple update today.  Not much going on.  The song of the day today is: "Teenager" by the Deftones.  It comes off their last album, White Pony.  It's a simple song, but I like it.  ' climbed your arms  then you pulled away  a new cavity moved into  my heart today  the more she sings  the more it seems that  that now I'm through  now I'm through  with the new you  I drove you home then  you moved away  new cavity moved into  my heart today  the more I scream  the more it seems  now I'm through  now I'm through  with the new you  new you '

      It's been a while since I've last posted.  I really don't know what to say most of the time.  I choose to post now because of this:  Zneval 2K2: UPDATE BLOG DAMNIT  It seems someone really likes to read this blog.  Anyways, I really don't have much to say.  Today is Monday.  Monday's are mostly not very good.  This morning I didn't feel well at all.  I thought about staying home.  I figured it would be nice since I had to present my speech today in Language Arts.  Don't get me wrong.  I wasn't thinking about staying home purely for that reason.  I honesly didn't feel well.  Well I went to school anyways.  Oh well, I'm fine.  Things are mostly going fine.  I'm working on switching my internet host for halbe.org.  I already signed up for a cheaper, better service that supports PHP.  That should be cool once I get it working.  Then I can have subdomains as well.  If I ever get a Couter-Strike server (which will probably be never) then I could set up an alias subdomain like cs.halbe.org.  Now that would be pretty w00t.  Staying on the subject of Counter-Strike, I'm in the clan C/A if you already didn't know.  Check out my stats  urlLink here .  I'm decent.  Not too great but I'm OK.  Bye

      I don't have anything to talk about today.  I just wanted your feedback on my latest rant.  I'll just post it here so you won't have to go to my site to view it.  So here it is:  Peer Pressure  While sitting in Cost Cutters today, I noticed a guy wearing an Ecko.complex shirt.  I was looking at him mostly because he had this nasty grin.  I was pretty bored so I started to think about that a bit.  Why is he wearing this shirt, I was thinking.  There are several reasons why he could have chosen the shirt.  Overwhelmingly I think most of the time it’s just the fact that everyone wears x brand.  The second could be that he simply likes that style or simply that he likes the comfort.  Possibly both.  What I’m ranting about is that sometimes people just don’t care to spend loads of money on expensive brands simply to show off or for other reasons similar.  I personally would wear just about anything as long as it’s comfortable, it doesn’t look too bad, and that it doesn’t have a huge label on it saying what brand it is.  Let’s take a step back here though.  If you see someone wearing xy brand from Wal-Mart and another person wearing the most expensive yz brand, you’re going to think differently of them no matter what you think.  I would honestly say that I would too.  That’s the problem we have at hand.  The amount of peer pressure is amazing.  Automatically if you don’t have something everyone else has, you’re an outcast.  That’s been going on for as long as anyone can remember.  Most parents could probably tell you a million stories on how Suzy had to have the latest shoes or she would be a reject.  It’s pretty much just a cycle to them.  Make the product a variable and the cost of it a variable as well.  Parents take a different approach.  They only look at the cost part.  They hold this approach rightfully.  They work for the money; they should be able to choose on what it’s spent.  The problem is the various industries are taking advantage of this peer pressure and jacking up the prices on their products.  No one cares.  They’ll still buy it.  If we go further, we’ll boil it all down to money.  Who has more is liked more who doesn’t is not.  The question I leave you with is this: is it possible to be liked without money?  Can character somehow be the standard like it was a long time ago?  That's it.  Give me some comments and I'll be happy.  Good night.

      I wonder what it is that has kept people from making comments.  It seems the last few posts have gotten none.  I don’t know what it is.  There are two options, I guess.  One would be that very little people come to this site.  Another would be that they simply don’t comment.  Whatever the case, I have no comments.  Perhaps I seem to have nothing worth commenting on.  That’s probably the case, I think.  So maybe I should start talking about stuff that’s more interesting.  I think that your typical ‘I’m tired, I hate off-season workout, song of the day, good night’ posts are boring.  So I think I’m going to go more into depth and try something new.  Go ahead and make a comment on what you think I should talk about in the future.  First thing I want to talk about is my headphones.  Currently I have a very low quality audio setup on my computer.  I have cheap onboard audio as well as cheap Logitech speakers.  These are nice cheap speakers though.  They have an audio jack in the back and have a volume control.  They have no bass though so I can’t really get the full effect.  (At this point my computer locked up, but thankfully Microsoft Word has a lovely AutoRecover feature.)  Where was I?  My setup goes from the PC to the speakers to the headphones.  I know for a fact that the noise is generated from the speakers.  When I plug the headphones directly into the motherboard, I get no screeching noise.  This concludes that the noise is generated by the speakers.  The solution would be to buy better speakers.  I think I will save up, buy a better sound card, as well as speakers and some lovely leather padded headphones (the huge ones that cover your ears and don’t hurt.  That’s all for now.  I need to be going to bed now.  Good night.

      I want to talk a bit about an article I read in Reuters a few minutes ago.  If you want to read the whole article go ahead and scroll down now or you can just read my summary.  I didn't want to post a link to it because I believe they change the links after a while on them.  The article is about Prince Philip making a joke.  His joke was this:  "Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?"  Here's the full article.   LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Philip has put his foot in it again -- with a joke about dogs and anorexics.   Queen Elizabeth's blunt-talking husband is renowned for gaffes that have caused blushes around the world from China to Australia.   And he hit the headlines again on Friday for all the wrong reasons after accompanying the monarch on a round Britain tour to celebrate 50 years on the throne.   Speaking to the blind Susan Edwards, wheelchair bound and accompanied by her guide dog, he remarked: "Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?"   Asked for her reaction after their brief encounter outside Exeter Cathedral in western England on Thursday, Edwards said: "It sounds like he was saying something terrible -- but he was just making a joke."   But Doreen Williams of the Anorexia and Bulimia Care organization was not amused. She called his comments "hurtful and unhelpful. I was quite stunned when I heard."   Reporters covering Prince Philip on royal tours keep their ears pricked for blunt off-the-cuff quips that often turn into diplomatic incidents.   Earlier this year on a trip to Australia, the prince asked Aborigines if they still threw spears at each other.   On another trip to Australia in 1998, he asked a student who had just returned from a walking tour in Papua New Guinea: "You managed not to get eaten then?"   But perhaps his most famous foreign faux pas came in China in 1986. He told British students: "If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed."   I want to now talk a little about this.  It seems the guy likes to make jokes at times.  The only problem with the equation is that anything he does inappropriate is plastered in the newspaper.  To be honest, this just shows the guy is human.  Keep in mind though that I'm saying this knowing almost nothing about the guy, so I'm probably off.  He could be a complete jerk.  But anyways, I just had to say that I feel bad that the guy can't make a joke.  We all say things inappropriate.  To think that he wouldn't is ignorant.  The only thing is that people in his position would most likely refrain from joking because they think more about getting a negative reputation.  They don't want people to think bad about them.  I just want to say that I admire the fact that he's being himself, good or bad.  At least he's not hiding anything.  Good night.

      Wow.  It's been a long time since I last posted.  I feel like I have to now.  Well you may or may not know that halbe.org has been down for quite some time now.  It all started when I found a host that was cheaper and had better features.  So I canceled my account and signed up with a new host.  That's when bad things started to happen.  First thing was that they charged me the whole 12 months worth of service instead of just the month like I thought I had selected on the option box.  I was wrong I guess.  Then I realized that their Unix plan had no option for multiple FTP accounts.  Then I wouldn't be able to host other people's sites without letting them have my FTP information.  Then I found out it would be $30 charge and a downtime of four days.  All to change it from Unix to Windows 2000 so I can have a few more FTP accounts.  Now there's no way that a Unix server wouldn't be able to have multiple FTPs!  They just want to restrict it to Windows 2000 I guess.  So if I'm going to want that in the future, I'm going to have to pay $30 and wait four days.  In addition to that, I'm currently in the process of just changing my DNS servers on my domain which is taking forever.  Network Solutions is not really doing a very good job of keeping a customer happy.  They don't care though because everyone has to register through them sooner or later.  Other than that I've been pretty busy with off-season stuff.  I'm getting used to it so I'm not complaining as much.  :-)  Until later.

      Well school's almost out now.  Just about 3 days left.  Tomorrow, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.  Wednesday and Thursday are half-days because of finals.  While I'm excited about getting out, I'm not excited about finals.  I'm sure I'll do OK on them but you can't help but be nervous.  Right now I'm thinking about summer.  I want this summer to be the best ever.  But for now, I am just thinking that I don't want it to be like last summer.  Last summer I was extremely lazy and did nothing productive.  Nothing at all.  You might have noticed I moved the site from Blog*Spot to my own domain.  That's because I now have a host with FTP instead of FrontPage.  So you won't see any ads anymore :-)  I'd like to thank BLOGGER for making it free :-)  For as long as I have this blog, you'll see the BLOGGER banner at the bottom.  Today's song of the day is: "Porcelain" by the Red Hot Chili Peppers  That's all for now.

      School is finally out.  I'm glad.  It's also a good thing that I got a 49 out of 50 on my presentation today.  :-)  Didn't do very much today.  More than a normal day but there's stuff I could have done instead of just sitting here doing nothing.  I went to Best Buy and got some new Sony headphones.  They're the kind that go behind your head.  I like 'em they're cool.  They sort of hurt my ear though.  I think I might be wearing them wrong.  I also got the new Moby CD '18'  It's pretty good.  That's about it for now.

      School is literally over in a day.  Two half-days of finals and I'm out of the place.  I really only have 4 finals to take and 3 are really finals.  The 4th is not a final but it's a presentation day.  I only have that one final on Thursday, the last day and I have to be at school at 9:15.  I don't have a 4th hour final and the teacher said we don't even have to be there on Thursday so it's all good.  Today I had to lift after school.  I planned on skipping, but I'm glad I didn't.  I didn't lift on Monday because it was a holiday but some football guys went in early to lift but I didn't know about it.  Basketball coach told us we'd lift Tuesday and then Thursday.  I'm confused on who I should take orders from.  The varsity basketball coach is now also going to be the sophomore football coach.  Football is before basketball.  Shouldn't I follow football stuff?  I thought so too.  :-)  We ended up doing 1x100 reps of bench press.  I did just the bar.  That may not seem like a lot, but keep in mind it's 100 reps.  Think of it as 4500 once.  :-)  Then we did some other stuff which was odd.  Oh well.  I'm bored now and don't know what to say.  Later folks.

      Not much going on tonight.  I wish I was doing something.  I really don't have time for anything.  Too bad I have to get up early everyday now.  It's getting to be a pain.  I wish I could exchange some hours durring the day for some at night.  I have to get up at 7AM Monday, Wednesday, Friday and 7:30 on Tuesday, Thursday.  So lifting and running gets done at about 9 then there's nothing to do.  No one's awake because they all stay up until 2 in the morning while I sleep.  Cool... no.  That's about it.  That's probably going to be my schedule all summer :-(

      I just cam accross this article in Reuters, thought I'd share it.  " PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - A 28-year-old Panamanian accused of killing a judge was eaten by a crocodile as he swam across a river after escaping from prison, police said on Thursday.   Oswaldo Martinez, accused of murdering judge Harmodio Mariscal on June 5 during a failed robbery in Panama City, was captured last week by police after fleeing to neighboring Costa Rica.   After being held in custody in Costa Rica, Martinez broke out of jail at the weekend and was aiming to reenter Panama through the dense jungle that divides the two Central American countries.   Martinez was eaten alive by the crocodile on Monday as he tried to swim across the River Terraba in southern Costa Rica, according to eyewitness reports confirmed by police on Thursday. "  That's irony for you.  Next time you think about crossing that river trying to escape, think again.

      Just got my new layout up for my michael.halbe.org site.  It looks nice and simple and I like it that way.  The one major thing is that I have to convert all my old stuff over to this new layout.  Everytime I create a new layout I'm always wondering if I'm wasting my time and am going to trash the new layout in a month.  Time will tell I guess.  Other than that not much is going on in the halbe.org world.  I really have nothing planned for the new halbe.org.  I remember I had a plan text file somewhere and had a bunch of cool ideas but I doubt I could ever get the time to manage all that stuff.  I really don't have the knowledge to do all the stuff I want.  I'm not saying I never will do some of the stuff I wanted, just not now.  That's pretty much it for now.

      Tonight was a bummer.  I went to downtown with some friends.  It was alright until the fireworks started.  I was looking for someone and didn't find them.  That really put me into sad mood.  :-/  After the fireworks, a 10-year-old boy threw a basketball at me and punched me.  I wasn't sure what to do, so I didn't do anything.  I just rememberd what I was like when I was ten.  I don't think I ever did anything like that.  Oh well.  Even though my day was not good, tomorrow I have to look forward to.  I don't have anything I have to do, so I suppose I could do anything I want.  Good night.

      I feel weird right now.  I'm not really thinking like I do normally.  I'm supposed to be getting ready to go to Chicago right now.  My family is going to take a trip there and do stuff.  I have no idea what we're doing but I'm going to try to have as much fun possible even for the fact that I'm being away from the things I actually find fun in my life.  I don't want that to sound like I'm complaining, but that's what I'm thinking.  I don't really want to go on this trip.  This is the first family vacation we've been on in a long time.  We normally just go to see relatives and just one or two people go out.  So it should be interesting.  Even though we are short one family member, it should be interesting.  I hope to take some pictures on the trip with my dad's digital camera.  He has a really nice Kodak Professional one that's a couple years old and is really bulky.  Thinking about lugging that around on a vacation is pretty funny.  Not really but what am I supposed to say.  I should probably be going now and getting ready.  Good night.

      Well I'm keeping busy lately.  I've been working hard on my website.  I actually have some content now.  I've been posting some reviews on a couple CDs I have.  I think that I might continue and write reviews on some of the newer CDs I have.  There's really no sense in writing reviews on the older stuff.  It's not likely anyone would look at it.  Nonetheless, if they were bored maybe.  I don't know we'll see.  Today at conditioning (yesterday really), we were all through the stations and we were on our last running activity.  I was sure to grab a swig of Frost Gatorade before that.  I don't like the feeling of a dry mouth and the little burst of sugar from it would be nice.  So I started to drink some and I guess I just had a bit too much.  We started our 'indian run' around the track.  It went fine for almost two laps right before I had to sprint to the front then set the pace.  I was on my way to the front when the person in front of me was slowing down.  I kept at his pace for a while then decided I was wasting energy.  I just went around to pass him until I got to the front.  That's when the Gatorade felt a little weird.  Within seconds of me finally getting to the front, I had to pull over and take a pit stop at the nearest grassy area.  Immediatly I went face down into the grass throwing up my Gatorade.  It came in three flows of blue Gatorade along with the acid in my stomach.  After the third flow of blue spew, I felt much better.  I'm sorry if that story made you sick.  It's time for me to go to bed now.  I have to lift in the morning.  Good night.

      Well things are going not too well lately.  Right now, there's no website for BLOGGER to publish to.  My site is currently down.  My domain (halbe.org) isn't even registered.  I'm not very worried about it though.  I don't think people are jumping on it as a domain they can't wait to have.  But I still need to get it registered.  Anyways my computer's broke as well.  I'm not sure what's wrong with it really.  It just locks up when I boot.  I think it might be something to do with the drivers because I was installing some updated drivers for the webcam or something I don't remember and the thing locked up when I was installing it.  That probably screwed with the system files or something.  I don't know what I'm going to do.  I'll figure it out.  I'm tired, so good night, folks.

      It's quite early right now, but it doesn't matter.  The relatives are here from California  I suppose I should be upstairs talking to them, but I'm going to be going to bed soon anyways and I really wanted to update everyone who doesn't read on what I did while I was gone for the last three days.  I make myself sound like I'm in a bad mood just there.  I don't know what I'm thinking right now.  Sometimes I think I type just to fill up space.  The same is to be said about those who talk to fill silence.  We are one in the same, I think.  Well, on to more uninteresting things.  So I went to Chicago, the windy city.  It wasn't very windy on any of the days.  We went to the aquarium, the art institute, the John Handcock building and the technology building with the omnimax theater.  I think we went to some other places but I forget.  It was fun the first day, but then I got amazingly bored the other days.  I'm not sure what to say about the city of Chicago in summary, but it was a good break from the norm of my summer.  I haven't done the song of the day in a while.  How about that?  Today's song of the day is: "In My Place" by Coldplay.  I suppose I will go to bed now.

      Right now I'm pretty dang bored.  Updating this blog seems pointless... it doesn't upload anywhere.  I guess it doesn't matter.  Today was a pretty long day.  Sometimes I like it that way though.  Today was neutral.  I had to get up early for running for a while.  That was cut short because we had to work on getting the sod laid down for the practice football field.  At first we didn't lay sod, we just removed rocks and stuff that would make the surface uneven or damage the sod.  That was pretty boring.  Then I left after picking up most of the rocks.  I went home and ate an early lunch.  I usually have two sandwiches that my mom makes me.  I always take for granted that someone makes my lunch everyday.  I should probably thank her tomorrow.  She’d be happy about that.  After I ate my lunch, I had to go to a basketball practice.  Pretty soon I’ll be going to a team camp and we went over some stuff about the camp.  It was just basically handing some papers out and going over a few plays.  Then I had to go back and actually lay some sod for the field.  I stayed there for quite some time.  From about 11:45 to around 3:30 I worked.  I must admit though, about an hour or so of the time, I had the easy job of helping the fork-lift guy line up the forks with the center rings on the sod coils.  That was about it, but the day seemed really long for some reason.  As of now, I’ve lost all my productive thought.  Time for bed.  I miss Stephanie :-(

      Today was ok.  Didn't do much during the day, like normal but I did get up very early to go with my friend to learn his paper route.  As soon as I got home, I went to bed.  I was thinking about staying up, but I soon fell asleep and woke up at about noon.  I was supposed to get a call at around 10 from the Mediacom tech support about my internet going out.  The story goes like this: I upgraded to Windows 2000 service pack 3 and once I restart from that, my internet drops.  I call the tech support and they tell me to do a bunch of stuff.  Nothing they ask me to do fixes it.  So the nice tech support lady told me that she'd have the tier 2 support reps call me when I wanted the next day.  I told her 10 because I figured I'd be up by then but I forgot about the paper route.  I don't know if they called or not but oh well back to the story.  So after the lady told me she'd have them call me later, I was just sitting there all bummed because my internet was out.  Just sitting there on the computer is extremely boring without an interent connection.  Amazing how that is.  So I was thinking, what do I have to lose, how about uninstalling the service pack and see what happens.  I do that and baaam!  My interent comes back.  Weird!  I'm getting tired now and I'm afraid that my dad will soon come down here and yell at me because he asked me about an hour ago to go to bed.  I took a shower thinking he'd think that I was getting ready for bed then zip, go back on the comp!  Wow.  Good night.

      And so I'm back from the Simpson team camp.  It was crazy.  I don't feel like talking about it because I'm tired.  All I will say is that I messed up my ankle pretty bad and ended up playing on it.  I don't know why.  The last time I did that, it got so bad.  I don't even want to talk about it.  Sometimes I wish that I could just stay up longer, because I get in such a thoughtful mood that I just wish I had more energy.  I can't stay up much longer, though.  I have to get up early and take over my friends paper route.  I guess he's going out of town.  Anyways, it's times like this that my thought process is in such a position that I wish I could be in for longer to be more productive.  I'm not sure why I can't think like this when I'm awake.  But I'm tired.  Good night.  Is good night one word or two?

      I'm back in business.  Halbe.org is back.  I'm happy but I really don't care that much!  Whoa!  It's just been so long and I've pretty much moved on with my life.  (I make it sound like someone died.)  I've got some plans for "michael." coming up.  New layout and I'm thinking about my own personal forum (bbs) for it.  Halbe.org then would be more geared for my family and michael., my site more geared to whatever I'm doing.. I like it's always been.  So that's about all I have to say.  I'm tired.  Night.

      Today was pretty long, I thought.  I had lifting in the morning.  I'd like to thank my mom for letting me sleep (not really sleep in) a bit longer.  I would have had to do the paper-route and all but I guess she just thought I shouldn’t do it because of my ankle.  I agree with that.  It is bad enough that I’m going to football camp and walking around all the time.  It still hurts all the time and is a pain in the, I want to say ass but that doesn’t hurt so I’ll say my foot.  So yeah, I lifted this morning.  I did bench press and power clean.  I’m getting pretty darn good with power clean.  I think I lift the most in my class.  I’ve gotten up to 190x3.  I always feel weird doing all that weight.  What’s worst of all is that I’ve been told my form isn’t all that great.  So if I got that down, I’d probably be able to do more.  I’m thinking that I’m not going to be making much gain on that.  Oh well, I don’t care much about how much I do.  Though is would always be impressive to be able to do more.  I don’t know... I’m just babblin’ now.  So after lifting, I went home and sat around for a while.  Then I went out to lunch and came home and slept for a while.  I love and hate taking naps.  Sure, when you’re tired, a nap sounds great.  But when you wake up, you always feel groggy and somewhat still strangely sleepy.  And that’s how I feel now.  That means I should go to bed.  Good night.

      Well just after checking up on my tech support 'ticket' on my host's support 'control panel' and seeing that my ticket hasn't been looked at over two days and eight hours.. I'm kind of mad.  But I'm also kind of tired as well.  I should get to bed!  Dang, it's 3 AM!  Night.

      Interesting was today.  Boring, yet somewhat exciting in the same way or at the same time.. I probably mean.  I had my first driving experience this morning.  It was very early.. around 6.  I was up for the paper route (last day, thankfully) so it was the right time since I just got my permit.  For the first time, I think I did pretty well.  That's what my dad told me, as well.  I didn't really make any mistakes other than driving a bit slow at times.  I suppose nothing's wrong with that though.  After all that I slept for a while.  I woke up to the largest gob of slobber on my pillow.  I was supprised to see so much all over my pillow.  I'm not exactly sure why I said that.  It had to be said.  No it didn't.  Who cares.  I went over to my friend Brett's house later.  Hadn't seen him in a while.  Was glad to have done that.  That's about it.  I've begun to notice that my blog posts are more like me explaining what I did each day.  It sucks, I think.  I normally would like to have actual thougs on topics and whatever's on my mind.  Not just what I do everyday.  I guess it all depends on what I'm thinking about.  I bet it also depends on when I blog.  Right now its 12:30 and I'm not thinking that well.  Right.  Night.

      I got rid of everything off the michael. ftp.  I still need to work out everything on the new layout first before I upload.  At this point I'd say I'm about 30% done with it.  If I wanted to, I could probably finish it all in about two days.  The only problem is that it's pretty boring tedious work.  I know what I'm doing, so that makes it boring.  It's just the same process of transfering content to new layouts.  I've done it a half-dozen times now.  I'm still thinking of shifting to php and forgetting the static html stuff.  I'd have to learn more php first though.  All I have down is basically how to print 'hello world'  I didn't really do much today, which is depressing.  It's Saturday and I didn't have anything to do today except the paper route and the heart walk.  Both of those were really early in the day.  That left me the rest of the day to sit on my butt.  I think I'm getting tired now.  Night.

      Now that I look back on it, I think everything the coaches said was true.  Maybe one or two things were incorrect but mostly everything they said was right on.  After watching the video of our practice, I can easily tell you I sucked.  I guess it is true you remember things in your favor because I didn't think I did as bad as I really looked.  That's alright for now I guess.  We've got about two weeks to fix all that.  Even with all our screw-ups (mine included) we're doing fine.  Anyways, today I had practice in the morning.  That was alright.  I'm kind of glad we have early morning practices.  It helps get you up in the morning.  Once practice was over, it was about 10 or so.  That's probably about when I would normally get up on a Saturday morning.  After that practice, I was wide awake and ready for the day!  w00t  Well I don't think I said anything about this yesterday, in the blog, but I made a list of 20 things to do before I went to bed.  20 things to do that were pretty easy, and pretty hard.  Nothing that I couldn't do, but nothing too easy.  I actually did 7 things on the list.  One thing I tried to do, and couldn't actually finish.  (Just so you know, it was 'get the bbs working' on my list.  Something's wrong with the BBS script and I posted on the support board on the website.  I'm pretty must waiting for a response.)  I could have done all the rest of the stuff, but I'm pretty lazy.  Also, I spent a lot of time going shopping with my sister today.  That was pretty fun actually.  We went up to Iowa City and I spent a lot of money out there.  I guess it's kind of nice that my birthday is so close to school starting because I get money for my birthday and I can immediately spend it on clothes.  This is actually the first year that I've thought about clothing.  Previous years, I really didn't think about it much.  It simply wasn't something I'd think about... because I really didn't care.  I care more now, but it's still not that big of a deal.  Everyone wants to look nice.  I guess I'm thinking about that more now.  Hmm.  Anyways that's about it for tonight.  Tomorrow I'm going to church and I'm thinking I'll try to get out to OfficeMax or something to get some stuff for school.  It's kind of pointless to go and buy stuff before you really know what to get, but you always have to have pens/pencils etc.  I probably already have all that, but no one likes to use old stuff when school starts.  You've got to have the feeling of opening a fresh box of #2 pencils and writing your name again on the top corner of the first worksheet due tomorrow morning first thing at the beginning of class.  Ehh.  That's the sort of thing I don't want to remember about school.  All the rest is great, I guess.  w00t.  I think tomorrow I'll try to do the rest of the stuff on the list.  Most of the stuff I didn't do is stuff I really don't need to do.  Just stuff I've been putting off because I can and don't have to do it anyways.  One thing I remember was that I wanted to organize an excel worksheet to record my papers so I could have an updated grade sheet.  I remember last year wishing I'd kept one updated.  I figure now that school starting, I have a fresh start to do whatever needs to be done from the start.  If that makes sense.  In other words, I want to do everything I think I'll need later, for the sake that if I remember it later and begin doing it, I won't miss it if it needed to be done to begin with.  Word.  Time for bed.  I've blabbered too much already.  Good night.

      I buy books, read the first few chapters, set them down and forget about them.  Either that or I don't even try to read them.  I need to stop that.  Time to stop now.  I'm going to change my life.  I'm going to act differently.  I'm going to change it all.  Sound weird?  Yeah.  I just don't like where I'm at right now.  I'm not saying anything's wrong.  All I'm saying is I'm going to change.  Football practice today.  That was interesting.  It was a pretty quick practice.  We did quite a bit of scrimmaging.  I thought I did alright.  I thought we all did alright.  What I don't get is the coaches getting on use telling us we suck after all that.  And what I don't like is one coach telling me I'm a leader and I sucked.  Screw that.  What the hell kind of coaching is that?  I guess if I don't knock someone down every play, I did something wrong.  All I remember from the scrimmages is people on the right side of the o-line letting all the d-line guys by.  I really don't mean to put it on them, but that's really what happened.  I know I screwed up a couple times (probably more) but for a coach to tell me I sucked when I don't think I did... that's wrong.  That probably sounds dumb.  It does.  You may be thinking... this guy's just saying that because he doesn't want to look bad if he really did suck.  You're probably right.  For all I know, maybe the coach only looked at me when I was messing up.  Who knows.  Anyways, school starts on Monday.  I haven't even gone school shopping yet.  I guess I'm kind of waiting for my mom to ask me if I want to go school shopping or something.  I have a feeling if we haven't gone by now, she's not planning to ask me.  It's probably more of a financial issue more than anything with my sister's wedding coming up and everything associated with it.  I think we all know weddings cost a lot of money.  I think when I get married; it's not going to be an expensive wedding.  Why does it have to?  It doesn't.  When two people love each other enough to engage in marriage, they're not thinking about the expense of their wedding.  They're thinking about their future with each other.  So with that in mind, I'm saying I'm not going to have an expensive wedding.  By the time I do get married; my parents are probably going to be dirt poor.  I'm the last child, so all the college loans and everything they've had to go through will catch up.  Weee.  It's getting pretty late here.  I'm kind of surprised I've been able to blabber so much about almost nothing.  I guess when you think about stuff enough, you can think of anything to write.  Tomorrow I've got practice in the morning.  Coach said we'd only be on the field for about 45-an hour.  Then we'd watch tape of the scrimmage.  I hope I didn't screw up that much.  If I remember, I'll update you on how much I actually screwed up.  Maybe I'll take down some numbers on how many times I did something wrong.  You'd just love that, I bet.  Just keep in mind this if I come back to you with info about how I did worse than I said: people tend to remember things in their favor.  It's true.  That's about it for now.  Good night.

      I really wish I had the way to fully express myself.  It seems like I can't tell what I really am feeling.  I'm thinking that my feelings may be fabricated and infatuated by what I think I want rather than what I need.  It seems like no one cares much anymore about what they need only what they want.  I mean all that aside from their needs as humans.  I'm not sure what I'm saying.  It just seems to make sense at the moment.  Either that or I'm just not in a good mood.  I'm afraid that's the case.  I know moods have affects on decisions, thoughts, and everything in general associated with your mind and body.  It's the tricky game we play.  The scary part is you don't know.  You can easily prove this by just looking at anyone.  Look at people driving cars getting frustrated with anyone causing any type of inconvience to them.  I'm just saying this for example.  There's probably better ones, but that's all I can think of.  I think you get the idea.  It's late.  I need to study my play book and go to bed.  Night.

      I finally got my own digital camera today.  I got a Sony Cyber-shot DSC-P7.  It's a 3.2 MP memory stick camera.  Pretty nice, I got a great deal and am glad I finally got my own camera.  It came with a 16 MB memory stick, but that's only good for 10 full res shots.  I want to get at least a 64 or 128 stick so I can take lots of high res shots.  Otherwise, I'd just use my dad's.  It's got a really nice battery and huge memory.  It's so bulky though.  I’m feeling pretty weird right now.  I’m not sure what it is.  Perhaps it’s my selection of music during the late hours of the night.  I remember the late nights of staying up just laying in my bed listeing to Miles Davis for hours.  "Blue in Green" and "Flamenco Sketches" on repeat all night long.  Just thinking for so long about the saddest of things.  I really don't know what I'm saying.  I just feel like that right now and I'm not sure why.  I'm really tired right now.  I'm going right to bed.  Good night.

      Once again I screw it up and I lose the post.  I clicked on a hyperlink and it opened in the blogger window.  :-/  Shucks.  Now I have to work up the desire to rewrite everything I talked about... if I can remember.  I've noticed lately that people I know have started their own blogs.  The one thing is that they're hosted on Xanga.  Xanga honestly seems like a great community of bloggers who want a complete page for their blog, events, reviews and a guestbook.  This sounds great.  (This is where I begin to sell Blogger)  The main problem with this is that it's all proprietary.  By that I mean that other than changing the theme of the page, you can't change the contents or even have it hosted on a different website.  I can see reasons why they'd do this, but compared to Blogger, it really doesn't measure up.  Blogger allows you to change the layout of the site completely.  You can host it on a different site, or have it hosted on Blog*Spot.  I just think Blogger's better, I guess.  I'm not trying to pick on anyone that uses Xanga or make them think it's the end of the world that they could possibly use such a cruddy service (kidding).  I just don't think it's the best thing out there.  Yup.  I'm getting really tired now.  I wish I wouldn't have blown that post.  I had so much thought in it and there's no way to get it back.  I need to develop a photographic memory.  Then, maybe I won't have to worry about the simple mistake of clicking links while you've got 113423342 lines of blog lined up to be posted.  Wow, I'm tired.

      Long day today.  School went just fine.  Wasn't too bad.  Friday's are great.  I'm sure no one can argue that they're not.  Physically, I'm very sore.  My back aches and I'm pretty sure I did something bad to my right thumb.  Right by the joint, on the inside of my hand is a bruise.  The pain, I can handle.  The only thing I’m worried about is doing something really bad to it.  I was thinking about taping it, but then again, what is there to tape?  I don’t feel like talking about it anymore.  If I do, I’ll just feel like I’m complaining.  Had a scrimmage today against the freshmen, instead of football practice.  According to all of the coaches we did horrible.  I can’t say I disagree, but I don’t think we did horrible.  We did crappy.  I don’t know what the difference is really, but yeah.  I’m tired.  Good night.

      Today was a long day, even without football practice.  The day went fine.  I took a few pictures during lunch.  They turned out great.  The lighting was just fantastic.  I plan on taking more during lunch tomorrow.  I also took some shots at the brand new YMCA.  I haven't gotten those off my camera just yet, because I only have two USB ports and I got a new optical mouse today at OfficeMax.  That mouse, by the way, was only 20 bucks.  It's one of those nice Microsoft ones too.  I was happy about that.  I planned on using it in my web design and computer graphics classes instead of the apple hockey puck mouse for the G3s.  I'm liking it a lot though.  I'm thinking about just keeping it.  I use this computer more than in my classes anyways.  I had a lot of homework to do today.  I got it all done tonight before midnight.  I was happy about that.  I was lazy this afternoon and wasn't really thinking much about doing it.  I'm just glad I got it done right now.  It's pretty late right now, so I should go to bed!  Night.

      Well, I'm making it a habbit to write (type) in this blog everyday.  It's a good thing.  Now I know what I've been doing everyday!  Boring, but interesting in a few months.  Today was crazy.  I remember hearing Coldplay playing on my CD player at 5 in the morning.  I still don't know how to turn off that auto-time play feature.  I'd have to take out all the CDs in the player if I don't want it to play.  I really don't feel like doing that all the time, or I forget.  Therefore I wake up to my favorite band at 5 am.  Speaking of Coldplay, I just got their new CD today.  It came out today, and I'm happy to say that I got it the first day, about 10 minutes before Best Buy closed.  I got it for $10.99!  Great buy, I think.  Anyways, I woke up pretty early to turn off the player.  I slept a bit more only to wake up to my alarm at 6:53.  I hit the snooze button 3 times I think then I just turned the alarm off.  I got up at about 7:30.  Went to school.  Everything fine until about 4th hour.  I then realized how tired I was.  I was on the verge of dozing off.  Went to lunch only to find that there were virtually no seats available.  I still got to sit by my home dogg, Spif.  That was weird, because I had to sit on the end of a table with is lame.  Anywho, 5th hour wasn't too bad.  I was pretty awake the whole time dispite the fact that we were watching a movie with the lights off.  6th hour rolls around, and I'm then tired.  I was dozing off left and right.  I was just glad to get out of the class awake.  Football next... I guess I was pretty awake by then.  I got to leave a little early though for driver's education.  That seemed like forever.  I finally get home at about 8:30.  That's a pretty long day, I think.  And tomorrow it all starts again.  (minus football practice and driver's ed)  Hah.  Good night.

      First day was today.  It was a long day.  I am so tired right now so this entry is going to be very short.  I still have homework to do.  Bah, I'm too tired to type more.  Night.

      School is tomorrow.  I'm a bit excited.  My schedule is pretty good, I think.  I have two electives that I know I'll enjoy or at least have fun with.  That should be cool.  Funny thing about my schedule is that the floor that my class is on alternates every hour.  So first hour is on the first floor, second is on the second floor, third on the first etcetera.  I hope we'll be able to use the computers the first day.  I know last year we didn't do anything because everyone has to get info from the IMC and get passwords etcetera, so I don't know.  I'm taking my camera tomorrow to get some pictures.  I hope to get some good shots :-)  I'll probably post them all on my website.  Yay!  I dunno why I'm so excited.  I really don't have anything else to say.  It's 11, so I should be getting to bed!

      It's been a while, so I figure I should blog before I go to bed.  It's pretty late.  Oh well.  I've got driver's ed in the morning, my first drive.  Weird.  Anyways, tonight was our first game.  We lost.  I'm not sure what to say, really.  I didn't do as well as I wanted to.  Somehow the o-line managed to do a good job.  Only 3 sack/knockdowns total.  At the half, we were only down by 7 if I remember correctly.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong.  I figured we'd pull off the win.  Apparently not.  We made some silly turnovers.. and da da da.. blah blah we ended up losing.  We had our little moments, but they seemed to have more moments than us.  So, our season begins with a loss.  Such a horrible thing, but we're going to bounce back on Monday and be better than ever.  Nothing else to say.  Good night.

      Just got home from practice.  I know I didn't update yesterday.  Thanks for those of you who reminded me.  It's weird for me to hear stuff like that because I just assume no one ever reads this.  Hah.  Anyways, practice was pretty good.  We are ready.  We are going to kick ass.  That's a fact jack.  I've got to be doing my homework and stuff, so I'll update later.  Peace.

      And so another day comes to an end.  Today was more so like yesterday, yet I had football practice.  I will though, begin by telling you the start of my day.  I got up at about 9.  I went to bed at about 2, so if you do the math that’s only 7 hours.  It seems as if my mind wakes me up even if I don’t get my 8 hours.  Odd, that is.  When I go to bed at 12 and I wake up at 7 feeling tired, I’m confused.  How does that work?  Maybe it has to do with there being light in my room or something weird like that.  I once saw a guy on techtv explaining a new kind of alarm clock.  This alarm clock had a light that had, I don’t know what you’d call it but dimming, for lack of any other word, mode that would turn on a light.  The light would get brighter until being fully turned on by the time you set the alarm.  The idea behind it, he said, is to have a more natural alarm clock.  It’s basically designed on the idea of the sun coming up and waking you up.  The one thing that’s funny about this is that when you wake up to this thing, at 5 in the morning, you go into another room and fall asleep.  The things also got a thing where you can put these scent beads that give off smell that’s supposed to wake you up.  Interesting stuff, I think.  Anyways I was talking about how I got up at about 9.  Right, well I did pretty much nothing up until football at 2:30.  I know it starts at 3 but I’m always paranoid when the clock turns to anywhere around 2.  I’m thinking… crap I’ve only got –x- long to do anything before football.  I’d like to officially thank the coaches for making me paranoid about time.  I’m probably never going to miss any important time in my life.  I’ll just get less sleep and my body will age faster, I’ll get gray hairs faster, I’ll get arthritis faster and I’ll die younger.  Thanks!  w00t!  Yeah, so I did pretty much nothing all day up until football.  Football practice went OK.  I think it was one of our best practices so far.  I’m glad it was because if we did worse than Friday, we’d have had most of our practice being conditioning or something callous.  Everyone figures it makes us tougher.. and it does.  It’s just a pain in the ass.  I’m complaining.  Let me stop now.  It’s a pain in the ass, but I enjoy getting it over with because I always feel better when I relax.  Tomorrow is week 2 of school.  Officially the 6th day.  I suppose we’ve only got another 170+ something days until summer.  Shouldn’t be too bad.  I’m actually looking forward to working hard in school and getting better grades.  w00t!  Anyways, in order to get my 8 hours of sleep, I need to go to bed.  Good night.

      I just got done submitting a lot of stuff to deviantART.  I love that site.  If you’re a photographer, graphic artist, or whatever… I really don’t see how you couldn’t.  It’s a really great site.  Anyways, today has been a very productive day for me as far as things related to computing.  I did a lot of work on my site.  I got most of the pages up with some content instead of ‘I’m working on this” messages.  It feels good to be able to click on any link and actually see something.  As weird as that sounds, it’s true.  I think I’ll work more tomorrow on getting old stuff converted to the new design.  I didn’t get everything converted yet and I should have probably done that first thing, but I never thought about it.  I got my first person to buy prints of mine.  It happened to be my mom, but nonetheless, I have a buyer!  Yay.  I have a total of two dollars and forty-six cents pure profit.  Woo yeah.  I’m not counting the cost of my print account, because technically that was a birthday gift.  So that’s awesome.  Had football practice this early morning.  It wasn’t as bad as I predicted.  I think that the coaches thought it over and decided to go easy on us.  We’ll be ready for the game, I know it.  We know it.  We’re going to win.  We are going to win.  Enough said.  It’s pretty early now.  I should have gone to be a long time ago, so I guess I’ll go now!  Night.

      Friday the 13th ended up being a good day.  We won our first game against Cedar Rapids Washington.  It was a great game to watch, I think.  We had a 80-yard drive down the field the first possession and ended up fumbling it and letting a 95-yard touchdown return go.  And to add to that a two-point converstion.  The game stayed tight until half-time.  Wash, still up by 8.  During half-time, we really got back into it and we came out an just plainly kicked ass.  I'd explain the rest of the game, but I just don't feel like it.  I will say though we had many guys step up and work their asses off.  I was disappointed I didn't play, to say the least.  (I do not count the 3 plays where we ran the clock down)  Nothing much more for me to say.  Good night.

      It’s hard to say just how a day goes when it goes by so fast.  Bad and good things pass you by so fast, you can’t remember them.  Maybe I’m speaking only for myself because I haven’t gotten much sleep lately.  Overall, I’d say that I haven’t gotten out of the summer groove yet.  School doesn’t seem the same.  That may sound odd, but it’s hard to explain.  I remember being able to remember everything I did in a day at school.  Now I can’t.  Remembering homework assignments is harder as well.  I used to be able to go without having to write them down.  Most of my classes are going fine.  I’m not really working hard at school so far, honestly.  Lack of interest being the most probable cause.  I suppose that should change.  It will.  Nothing much more to say, as it always seems.  It’s late again.  Good night.

      Just got done with some homework and thought I'd get back into the groove of updating every day.  It's interesting how homework can be.  Some people, like me, do anything just to get the work over with.  I'm trying to do the assignments 100% but, in the process, actually learning the information is hard.  That would take much more time, really.  I suppose if you really want to get good grades, you have to do that.  I'm pretty sure I lack the excitement to learn something.  Reading from text books is not very exciting when you can easily fall asleep if you put your hand on your chin.  I can't seem to stay awake while reading from textbooks in class.  I think I need more caffeine.  I know the school has vending machines all over the place to suck our money right out of our pockets, but I don't care much about something that tastes good.  I think more about quenching my thirst.  Drinking Gatorade and water all the time really changes your awareness of thirst.  Some say drinking soda makes you thirstier.  I say it just gives you massive amounts of plaque build up and a sugary dryness in your mouth... yuck.  Water please.  If you looked at my desk right now, you'd immediately call me a hypocrite, because I've got an empty can of Pepsi sitting to my left.  I suppose it's different though.  I could easily get a glass of water if I wanted, while in school, I've got to make the decision of getting the soda or water (or drinking fountain) before class.  Wow.  I think I talk nonsense extremely well.  Nonetheless, that's all I can seem to focus on right now.  I have nothing left to say.  Good night.

      I'm wide awake.  It's 1:45 AM.  I have school tomorrow and a football game.  Why am I up so early?  Finishing homework.  I feel better now.  I have the work done.  This week, in my mind, has been one of the worst weeks of the year 2002.  I say that because my memory is bad at times.  It's really hard to express in words how things went this week without using many curse words.  I thank everyone who talked to me about it.  I appreciate it.  At this point, I honestly can't think so I'm going to go.  Perhaps I'll update tomorrow after I get some sleep.

      I'm about to go to bed now.  I only hope I don't have another nightmare as I did last night.  I woke up at 4 and couldn't sleep because I was just too scared.  I'll never be able to explain these dreams... they're always so vague and just plain weird.  I remember having the same type dreams when I was much younger, back in California.  These dreams make me fear for my life.  Hard to explain, but it's just scary.  I ened up watching tv for a few minutes just to calm myself down a bit.  Homecoming was tonight.  I had a good time.  Some things were just bad, mainly my own fault... none of which I'd like to talk about.  But damn... I can't dance.  Hope you have a good night.  Song of the night: "#41" (Dave Matthews Band) ... "I wanted to stay, I wanted to play... I wanted to love youuuuu..."  Great song.  Heh. :-)

      I wrote myself a little 'task' to post what's happening in my life right now.  I've been so busy lately.  I don't have any time.  It's Monday right now.  I never expected to stay up this late, I just had to post something so I wouldn't feel bad about not posting.  Anyways, my schedule is really busy right now.  I hardly have time to think.  At first, the football schedule really hurt me (academically).  Now I'm getting mysefl caught up and I think I'll be ok  I get into trouble when I stay up late like this then have to get up early and work a 12 hour day.  I don't mean job, but I mean school, football and drivers ed until 8:30.  I normally take about 2 hours just to relax and get myself able to walk.  By that time I don't feel like doing homework.  I end up doing as little as possible or go in early the next day.  I'm not very smart -- I haven't used the weekends to my advantage.  The only day where I really don't have much to do is Sunday.  And even Sunday can be busy.  I'm not sure how I'm going to get myself on track, but I'll manage.  Tomorrow will be a hard day.  We lost last week against Prairie.  (I had to spell check prairie.  Why is it so hard to spell?)  "Last week'll be a cakewalk compared to what you'll have to do if we don't win this game."  That is what I have to look forward to at the end of the day.  Do me a favor and pray that I stay alive today... even though it would be too late because chances are no one will read this before practice.  Lordy, Lordy.  Oh well.  I have nothing left to say.  Good night.

      Rough day of work.  Started off really bad without me knowing it.  Later on I found out I missed my 1st hour driving time.  That sucks.  The rest of the day went OK I guess.  Football rolls around, and whoops I don't have a practice jersey.  I'm screwed.  Luckily I borrowed an old one from the equiptment office.  So I stick out [even] more with this green jersey while everyone else of course has white.  I'm not the only one to forget, but somehow I'm the only one to get the annoying green jersey.  Hmm.  Anyway, I get out of football early for drivers ed like normal.  I go up to the room, walk in and no one is there except a few people.  All the rest of the chairs were up so I figured it was a teacher conference.  I rememered from last week how the teacher said that we'd have class 7-9 on the 15th (which was to be a conference day).  I thought maybe he got the date wrong or something so I just headed home, thinking I'd come back at 7 and stay until 9:15.  So I walk home, get some food and come back at exactly 7 and notice everyone is already there and the teachers in the middle of a discussion about parking.  Oops.  Right.  I can't describe how stupid that feeling is.  The problem is that I thought I was fine and that the class would just be at 7.  I was wrong.  Class wasn't too bad though.  I mean it was only an hour for me and I noticed he took attendance after I got there and never said a word to me about being late.  That was the only upside, I guess.  I was just working on a project here for the site.  A photo essay about me moving into my brother's old room.  I'm kind of excited about the idea.  I've never done anything like it and it's interesting I think.  Maybe I'll get some new visitors.  Other than the few pictures of the room, I haven't taken many pictures lately.  I really don't have any time.  Overall, I guess my day wasn't that bad.  I just make it seem bad, maybe.  That's all I've got to say for now.  Good night.

      Well, today ITEDs are over.  If you don’t know what they are, let me explain as briefly as I can.  ITEDs are the only standardized test the state of Iowa has.  I forget the details but who cares anyways?  Let me continue.    Throughout the tests, I had to stop for a few moments and just clear my head.  So much is going on in my life right now, sometimes I feel like I’m going to explode.  There’s so much I could say really, but I express this depression in a somewhat unconcerned look.  I kind of consciously day-dreamt through it.  To get back on track here, I kept thinking through the tests what kind of effect this actual test is going to have on my life if I were to do badly.  I thought, this would go on my permante record.  If I did extremely badly in a particular part of the test, would I fall behind in society and get a lower paying job and end up in a crummy one room apartment almost to the point of being on welfare?  I surely couldn’t tell you at the moment, but that’s what I was wondering only several questions into each test.  Whenever I got stuck I’d go back into that loop of though and be distraught by my possible future.  In total, I didn’t answer 19 questions because of time limits.  I couldn’t help but wonder if they actually gave enough time or if I was just not intelligent enough to finish it in time.  I will never know.  I need sleep.  Don’t we all?  Question of the moment: Why do glass light bulbs screw in place?

      Well it has been awhile since I sat down and wrote in my blog for a good amount of time.  Don't be fooled, I can't spend that much time right now because it's late as it is.  I never seem to fit everything I need to do in a day in a day.  The previous sentence may make no sense to you, but I think differently.  Anyhow, I'm busy all the time and barely get 6 hours of sleep a day.  Starting tomorrow, I hope to change that somewhat because it is a short day.  It's not a half-day of school or anything of sort.  It is short because it's the day before a game practice and we normally have short practice.  I'm looking forward to getting home early and being able to relax for a short time then work on homework and stuff.  I'm not sure how that will work out though, because I'm always tired when I get home no matter what day.  I am looking forward to basketball right now for only one reason -- practice is only around two hours.  I don't mean to say I don't like football, because I do, it's just that I don't seem to be learning all that much or actually making myself a better player in that long practice.  I'm not sure why, but I don't seem to see how drills and such help all the time.  Maybe it's just me.  I don't think I am, by all means, the best player out there nor do I think I try the hardest.  Motivation, perhaps but my life right now is kind of in a slump.  Long days with little sleep don't exactly put me in much of any good mood by the time I get home.  I feel like I've already said that around four times.  Elsewhere, my life is busy.  The only real day where I don't have much to do is Saturday, which I still have the weekly chores etc.  Still those chores compared to the rest of the days, is not much.  Fridays and Saturdays transpose my sleep time.  I stay up very late on Friday night and sleep until noon.  Stay up until 2 and sleep until 10 or so.  I suppose I could say I lack any consistency.  I really don't have much to say about that.  It's quite late, and I really do need to go to bed because I must get up early to go in and work on some homework corrections.  That sounds like great fun.  I wish though, that I could put myself into a good mood when I wake up in the morning.  I never seem to be fully awake when doing anything in the morning.  I suppose that's why I can actually go in early and get things done because everything's going through my subconscious.  That or I'm just babbling.  Good night.

      I want so badly to say something of meaning and importance but I can't seem to think of anything.  Throughout my day, I can ramble on and on about almost anything without thinking.  In times like this, I suppose I'm too tired to think in that same manor.  There's no time during the day to write anything down.  I do not have a study hall.  I find myself coming up with blurps of intelligent though that I never write down.  If you ever see me 'zoning out' then you know why.  Bed time.

      As far as I know, you cannot read this -- at the time being at least.  Currently, I'm going through a redesign of my personal page.  I haven't been able to find time for that in my schedule.  The least I can do is update my simple blog.  Times like this I don't say much.  I only say what I do and yeah.  Anyways like I said I've been busy.  I've started back up with taking pictures.  I've reorganized my photos on my hard drive.  It makes it much easier to find stuff I think.  Soon I'm going to make galleries on my page and it'll be tight like that.  Anyways, another thing that's happened is that I've gotten a new desk in my downstairs area.  It's pretty nice.  I'll post some pictures of that also, soon.  I've been a BIT more organized with my computer stuff lately.  I've taken more time to organize my files and crap.  I can tell that it really does pay to be organized in life.  I just never take the time to do it.  Maybe I should?  It seems as if my Halbe.org shirts were/are a success.  I'm really happy they turned out good and that so many people like them.  I must say that I'm supprised.  I didn't suspect so many people asking me to buy one.  That's amazing.  Thanks goes out to everyone who bought one!  Basketball starts soon.  I don't know what to think about that.  I'm not really thinking much about it at all.  If I were excited, I know I'd be thinking about it.  I would probably be going to the open gyms too.  I'm kinda too busy I guess.  As soon as that Thanksgiving break gets here, I'm going to be really happy.  I suppose I could be stupid and waste all the time, like I normally do during breaks, or I could use it to get stuff done with my website and stuff.  I know there's lots of things I'd like to do but sometimes I'm just lazy.  I think being organized helps out with this because when I have a list of tasks to do and I see many things undone on that list, I'm going to feel weird about doing other things.  Well, I guess I should be heading to bed now.  I need to get some sleep.

      Well, it’s been a long day and night.  I have to say that today has been one of the best days in quite awhile.  I got a lot done, and had some fun.  That’s the kind of things that are great to look back on.  While I’m happy about today tomorrow, I fear, will be the complete opposite.  Tonight, I went and saw  The Ring .  It was a scary movie, I must say.  I think mostly because it was weird.  There were so many things to link together it didn’t make much sense but thankfully my good friends who had already seen it explained it to me and all was well.  I had a great time and had quite a bit of fun.  If you didn’t come along, you missed out!  Monday begins the break and I’m happy for that.  The only downside is I still have basketball.  If I could pause that for a week, I would.  My life has been so complicated and frustrating for the last few months.  It even hurts to think about it – so I won’t.  Good night.

      The last day of finals is tomorrow and I am very excited to say the least.  Once I walk out of the door at around 6 I just might dance myself all the way home because I'll be free!  Though I'll be thinking about that moment all through my day, I know I've got a lot to do to get to that point.  First of all, I have basketball in the morning.  If you ask me, that's probably the worst thing in the world to have right before the last day of finals.  That's really crazy because that time should be spent for sleeping and for getting ready for finals!  I guess they didn't think about that when making the schedule for basketball!  Anyways I've got my World History final, my Language Arts presentation, and my Geometry final.  After that, I have to go in to make up for being sick to Computer Graphics.  I need to turn in my animation video.  Also, I have to stay after to make up my Geometry tests and quizzes that I would have made up the days I was sick.  I hope that I can get those done before I have basketball at 2:30 (really 3 but they say 2:30 anyways.. those bastards!).  I don't know -- but we'll see!  Anyways I should be getting to bed!  Good night.

      "Hoping everythings not lost..."  Isn't that the truth.  I did it again.  I typed a bunch and it disappeared when I clicked on something in AIM and it threw the browser off.  I don't know, but why can't they just make it open in a new window?  Either they assume you're not on a form page or they assume you don't want another window open.  Sometimes I wish AIM would just got to hell and we could all have and open standard like IRC for chat.  Better yet, a peer-to-peer IM system would maybe be more efficient.  No one likes to look at the AOL ads on AIM.  Hell no, I don't want 3000 hours for 3 months free.  Don't you already know  that you sent me 4 CDs with the latest version of AOL on them?  Who's the guy that works for AOL that's in charge of sending out these CDs?  I want to find his home address and start up a site to have people send all those CDs to his doorstep.  Wouldn't that be a crack-up?  In any way, shape or form, I don't think people want to hear about how many free hours they can get for AOL.  I have a feeling my mother is going to yell at me and tell me to go to bed so that's what I'm about to do.  Song of the moment: "Going to California" by Led Zeppelin  Good night.

      I told myself to blog yesterday (Saturday) and I must have forgot, but I figure I shouldn't let it go by so I blog now.  Yesterday (Saturday) was a good day.  At the moment, I can't recall anything I did.  I suppose that can be called ironic because I made it seem like I had something to write about.  That must be a let-down.  Tonight was great - I really am not sure why but it just was.  I didn't go out or anything of sort - I just stayed home, surfed the web, talked to friends and listened to music.  Somehow out of that I feel enlighened in some way.  Don't get the wrong idea.  I didn't do anything I wouldn't normally do.  It just seemed (and seems) like my ideas were so conclusive and presise.  In some manner I guess you could say I was 'on top' of things.  Weird - is all I'll say to explain it.  Song of the moment: "One Million Miles Away" by J. Ralph  Good night.

      "Well I never ment.. to do you wrong.. that's what I came here to say -- but if I was wrong, then I'm sorry...  don't let it stand in our way.  'Cos my head just aches... when I think of.. the things I shouldn't have done.  But life is for living, we all know -- and I don't wanna live it alone."  It looks like I'm not going to get much sleep tonight.  I was told by my geometry teacher that these assignments would take no longer than 20 minutes.  This one ended up taking me an hour -- and I skipped some problems halfway through because I didn't know what to do.  If you know me, you know I'm a lot smarter than that.  I don't suppose it's my fault.  She only lectures us for about 10 minutes of the class then rushes to write out all the notes so we can do as much of the assignment as possible.  So really we get most of the hour to listen to her ramble every 7 minutes about how when we grow up, having a masters degree in math like her is going to help us get any job we want.. just like she could, but she loves teaching.  I hope she's not reading this right now.  And suppose she is, what would she do?  Nothing I hope.  All I'm doing is ranting about how I don't like her and her teaching.  I would switch teachers, but you know what?  I don't want to.  There are a couple reasons why.  For starters, I'd like to get my basketball coaches in trouble for telling me to switch.  (Hrm, if they were reading this, what would they do?)  What the hell kind of a thing is it to tell players to switch teachers because of them requiring extra effort on academics?  What the hell is the point of school, damnit?  That really pisses me off, and it makes me sad about the direction the basketball program is going.  If you're saying, 'what direction is it going?' then I would have to say I don't know.  There are a lot of things about it that just.. are.. fishy.  The only thing I have to say is that high school basketball is no longer about fun.  It is no longer about playing for the love of the game.  It's about dedication to the program.  It's about being 20 minutes early for practice -- and having practice 20 minutes before the scheduled time.  It's about having practices on Sunday.  It's about coaches saying 'HAVE FUN' and yelling for a missed reboud.  It's about spending, in my opinion, gobs of time on something that, if you're not Michael Jordan, will have no effect on your life.  Most of what I have said is probably wrong.  I don't care to dispute its validity -- it's my opinion.  It's simply that basketball for me.. is not the same.  I realize how much I've ranted and raved about nothing in particular.  I'm just extremely tired of my schedule.  I need more sleep.  I hope you've had a better week than I have.  Song of the moment: "See You Soon" by Coldplay  Good night.

      Right now I wish that my computer had a quieter fan.  The things so loud.  That and the noisy hot water pipes that run right above this room.  Ehhh!  That  is  going to be fixed.  I say that with determination in the fact that either I am going to fix it or force someone else to fix it!  Tonight was good.  I actually got my homework done pretty early.  I'm going in early for Geometry.  I hope that I can keep up with my schedule.  I was just up in my room a few minutes ago looking at some of my books.  It's been a long time since I'd actually had spare time to sit down and read.  I got out an old book on basketball.  I have no idea where it came from.  I was just reading it a bit and noticing how almost all the drills in it were ones we do in practice.  Weird.  I somehow felt inspired to do some of the things in the book.  All that dispite the fact that I dispise hard drills because they make my knees hurt.  To me, it seems like a new hurt feeling.  You normally say hurt like aches & pain after a hard workout, but every now and then I get weird feelings in my knees like they can't support as much weight.  It's like doing shadow squat (squat without weight on the bar) after practice is hard because my knees just seem to want to give out after I go down about halfway.  It's probably just me, but I thought I'd say that anyways.  I'm not one to complain, but I think I have a right to say something when I think it could be a problem.  I didn't mention practice today.  I think it was pretty bad.  I don't know how, but I started off with a good feeling about practice after school.  We started off by running extra because coach thought we weren't going as fast as we should in dribble warm-up.    I need to go to bed, my mother says.  I suppose I could explain more later, but I'd be lying if I told you I would for sure.

      Right now, I'm pretty awake.  A lot's happened in the last few days and I feel like you all should know.  Even though at this point, I don't think anyone reads anymore.  Nevertheless I'm going to keep posting because it's always fun to read my old entries.  Alright, today was alright.  I would have liked to have more time to just relax but I haven't gotten much sleep the last few days.  Yesterday morning or I should say Wednesday night we picked up my brother at the airport.  He was given time off for Christmas from basic training.  He has to go back for 3 days.  Mom is telling me to go to bed.  Good night.

      I always find it odd to post an update so late during a school week.  Sometimes I have something to say, or just feel like saying what's on my mind.  At the moment, I don't have much of anything to say.  All I have is your typical generalizations about life like... it's hard, it's stressing, it's depressing, it's anything and everything hard.. easy, sad.. happy, evil.. pure, and anything and everything you can think of.  Thoughts like this just drive mad in my mind when I think about life in general.  There are so many 'things' out there to happen, think of, do and the list goes on.  I dunno what I'm trying to say.  I have a lot on my mind and it's stressful.  Song of the moment: "Yellow" by Coldplay  Good night.

      I made a recurring task to write in this blog once every week on Sunday.  I guess then I won't forget to update you on my life.  Well, I'll begin by talking about today.  Today I got up pretty early.. about 7 or so, I think.  I was mad at my Dad, like always when he wakes me up on Sunday mornings.  It must be the way he wakes me up, or just people waking me up in general.  I'm always in a bad mood when I wake up.  I'm sure it has to do with the fact that it's annoying for someone to interupt your sleep.  Sleep is such a vital element to the success of humans.  When my vital sleep gets interupted, I get pissed.  Anyways, I finally got up and we went to church.  After, we went to Perkins and ate breakfast.  I had the usual supreme burger... yum.  After that, we went home.  After awhile we all decided to go to the Iowa City mall where I looked for some shoes.  I figured I needed something other than basketball shoes to wear.  I get sick of them sometimes.  I tried on a bunch of different shoes.  I liked Dr. Martens the most.  It just so happened that in all the stores that had the style I wanted, didn't have the shoe in my size.  Yeah bummer.  But all was not lost, because after eating Subway, we went over to Best Buy and I got the 'Shiver' import Coldplay single.  It had two songs I didn't have, or at least songs I didn't have on CD.  Nevertheless, I wanted the CD just so I could look at the amazing cover art.  So I was happy about that.  Listening to track 2, "For You" makes me wish Coldplay did more piano oriented music.  Their tone with the piano is always brilliant and beautiful.  The kind of music that makes you want to learn how to play.  Well, I suppose from that you could say I had a good day.  Maybe I did or maybe it's just my mood right now.  I think listening to Coldplay puts me in a good mood.  I can't think of anything else to say right now.  I think I should be getting to bed now anyways.  Song of the moment: "For You" by Coldplay  Good night.

      I'm getting mad now.  I updated twice, but I lost both of them.  If this doesn't work now I'm going to blow a gasket.  Anyways, I woke up early this morning for basketball.  I hate getting up early but I guess that's just something I gatta do every now and then.  Practice sucked, but oh well.  After that I just hung our for several hours.  Then I had dinner which was a sandwich and some Cheez-Its.  It was alright.  Then Whitney came over and we played Xbox for about 3 hours.  It was fun :-)  That's about it.  Night.

      Well this morning sucked.  I woke up at approx. 9:30 AM.  I was supposed to be at practice at 9:40 dressed and ready.  I woke up and my first reaction was "crap."  I hurried and got to practice and was only about 2 minutes late.  Dispite that, I did my dots and stood around with everyone else and waited for the girls to get done.  I was technically there about 15 minutes before practice actually started, but I was counted late.  What the hell?  Oh well.  Anyways after practice, we went over to Best Buy and got a controller.  My dad also bought a racing wheel because he was actually excited to play the racing game.  I was supprised.  The only thing I was mad about was that he didn't get the DVD remote.  Apparently he got the wheel instead.  How stupid whas that?  Oh well.  After that I just sat around and played some Xbox.  Then I went to the movies with Whit and we were going to see Die  Another Day but again it was sold out.  Wow big supprise.  We saw Two Weeks Noice in stead and I have to admit it was pretty good.  It was a chick flick for sure.  That was really the only highlight of my day.  And even that in some way was a bummer because I wanted to see Bond.  Oh well.  Good night.

      Well after playing at least 20 games of pool with Whitney, I'd say today, this afternoon, and tonight was the best Christmas in a long time.  A lot has changed but I think most of the changes were for the better.  Tomorrow I have basketball practice early in the morning.  I hope that goes well.  Once that is over I'm going to try to swing over to Best Buy and exchange my defective controller.  I think I might pick up Madden 2003 for Xbox while I'm at it.  I don't know though.  Maybe I won't.  I was thinking about saving my money in the bank.  I'm not sure exactly what I'm planning on doing with it but I was thinking about getting a laptop.  Perhaps a down payment on a new Jetta?  Who knows.  I just get the feeling like I shouldn't spend it right now.  Good night!

      I made the horrible mistake of going to bed too early.  I'm wide awake.  It's Christmas -- and I have to wait at least another 2 hours and 15 minutes to open presents.

      Word.  I figure'd I'd update before Christmas.  Was woke up pretty early this morning.  Around 5, my mom wakes me up to say bye to my grandparents.  They left for the airport and all that.  It was really nice seeing them for the time they were here.  We didn't get to do much, but just talking to them was great.  Anyways, today my mom and I finished up Christmas shopping.  We got my dad some presents.  I won't say what they are because there's a chance he could be reading this.  I wouldn't want to spoil it, now would I?  Whatever.. yeah so we finished up that and went to Best Buy, Target and Barnes & Noble.  I spent my gift card there on a book by Kevin Mitnick, the computer hacker.  It's called  The Art of Deception .  I've read a few pages of it and it's pretty good so far.  Just the intro was really entertaining.  I think the book will be pretty fun.  Anyways, other than getting that book, I was looking at some MCSE certification books.  I wanted to get one and start in on getting certified.  I know that people who do get certified get big time jobs directly after being certified.  If I start that now, maybe I could get a job and start making the bank.  If not a lot, then at least I could pay for some of my college or something.  Buy a car or something -- just getting ahead financially in life.  I figure I'll do something with computers in my life so there's no sense in waiting until later to get education for it.  I dunno what else... I think I'll just leave it at that.  Have a happy Christmas!

      Howdy.  Not much going on right now.  Just relaxing and doing  not much of anything a the moment.  That's pretty much how it's been all night.  I've been working really hard on halbe.org and getting it updated and everything.  I actually have some interesting articles and stuff up there right now.  You should check them out if you haven't already.  They're pretty entertaining and informative.  Anyways, today and yesterday I worked on getting my mom's new computer working.  I installed Windows 2000 Professional, Office XP, Quicken and TurboTax.  Pretty much everything and only everything she'll ever use on it.  My dad bought her a beautiful new LCD flat-pannel display.  The thing is so bright, it puts my monitor to shame.  I'd honestly say I'd rather have that if I could run it at a higher resolution.  The one she got only goest up to 1024x768.  Nonetheless though, it looks brilliant.  Anyways, I installed all those applications and got a million and one software updates.  So many service packs and security updates for Internet Explorer.  I was tempted to install Mozilla but figured she'd never figure it out or like it.  Well I got the thing together and everything.  I had to find a driver for the old USB ethernet adapter I used.  I put it on a floppy only to find that the floppy drive on the computer worked only when it felt like it.  So I went over to my dad's laptop and burnt a cd of it that I found on the internet.  I put it in there and went trough the driver install only to find it was the wrong driver.  After trying the thing over and over I then realized that and went to look at the actual divice behind my mom's huge desk.  I couldn't see it so I had to search the house for a flashlight.  I couldn't find one so by this point, I'm pissed.  I finally find one under the seat of my mom's Tahoe.  I look back there and find out the actual divice number of the adapter.  I found it and then went and had to burn another driver onto the CD.  I was glad the CD let me add more to it because if it didn't I would have wasted a CD only making me more mad.  So I go it the internet working.  I was happy about that.  I later put my CD burner in it and waited for my new Sony drive to show up.  After I did that, my brother, my mom and I went out with our grandparents to lunch.  We were going to go to Bennigans but they were pretty booked.  We eneded up going to Bishop's buffet.  I was pretty hungry because I didn't have breakfast.  The food was pretty good.  I had myself some fried chicken and about 6 rolls all buttered up.  I tell ya, those were some good rolls.  Yup that was good.  We then proceded to go to the Disney store to get my sister an Eeore stuffed animal she wanted.  The thing's huge.  She's going to like it.  That's pretty much it.  Night.

      Well here I am at home listening to Coldplay on this cold day.  If you haven’t heard the song ‘For You’ I highly suggest you download it or buy the Shiver single.  It’s excellent.  :-)  Anyways I’m not doing much of anything because 1) I’m sick and 2) I’m bored.  Put those together and you have me right now.  I can tell the antibiotics are kicking in because I’m feeling a little better.  The only thing is last night I kept waking up about every hour not being able to breathe.  It’s weird.  The medicine seems to affect my tear ducts.  I also had a really weird dream.  I know most weird dreams I have I always seem to forget about 15 minutes after I have them but I remembered this one.  I don’t feel like explaining it thought.  It’s just one of those weird dreams.  Anyways I didn’t update yesterday.  Oh well.  Yesterday sucked anyways.  I don’t feel like talking about that either.  I think I’m going to go play Yahoo pool now.  Maybe I’ll update later today or this weekend.  See ya.  Song of the moment: “Shiver” by Coldplay

      Happy New Year 2003  My new year started off bad.  I hope yours started off better than mine.  For new years, I didn't do anything.  I pretty much sat around.  I went to bed before midnight mainly because I was tired and felt sick.  That along with the fact that I didn't have anything to do!  I was bored all night.  Today sucked.  I sat around all day being sick.  What a way to spend the first day of a new year :-(  Oh well.  I did play some Xbox and played a little pool online with Whit.  That was fun at least!  :-)  Tomorrow my brother leaves for South Carolina and the last few days of basic training.  Then he graduates and moves to California for his year of language training.  I wish him the best!  I don't have anything else to say.  Night.

      What's up?  Well nothing at the moment.  What's happened tonight?  Well this will probably be short because I should be in bed right now.  Tonight was kind of a bummer, but not at the same time.  That happens and it's weird.  Oh well.  You get what I mean.  Anyways.. on to the story.  Whit, Peglow, Hudson and I were going to go bowling and we went around to all 3 bowling allies (sp?) looking and only finding that they were all full!  What the hell?  Since when do bowling allies fill up?  Well I guess it was National Bowling Day again, am I right?  So we decided against bowling and rented a few movies.  We got 40 days and 40 nights.  It was a bummer.  I guess it wasn't too bad thought.  I almost forgot to say how after the movie Whitney and I played pool in real life and she kicked my ass.  She's pretty good at the pool... so watch out if you ever play her.  :-) Hah!  That's about it.  Oh by the way, I'm starting to write everyone's birthday down.  If I don't have yours, let me know it so I can say "Happy Birthday!" when your birthday comes.  Other than that, have a nice night/morning.  Night.

      I'm pretty tired so I'm going to have to make this short.  I've got practice tomorrow morning.  Today was alright.  Got up early and went to church.  After that went to Perkins and ate breakfast.  After we went to K-mart, Wal-mart and Best Buy.  I got NBA Live 2003.  It's pretty awesome.  Anyways after that I kind of just hung out here, took a nap and that's about it.  Pretty boring day, I think.  That's it!  Night.

      Well today was interesting.  I got up at around 9 for basketball.  Went to Harding for the scrimmages.  We played 4 games.  2 against the Freshmen.  We pretty much won all the games even though they didn't keep score.  During the last game against the Freshmen, I caught a nasty elbow close to my temple right against the bone closest to the eye.  It felt like someone hit me with a bat on my head.  I was shook up but I'm alright.  Really all that happened was I got a headache and my eyes teared up.  I was really glad when that was over because I really don't like basketball on Saturday mornings.  Anyways after that, we had to lift at Kennedy.  That was dumb, I don't know why we did that, but oh well I got that done really quick.  I was happy when that was done.  After that I just sat around for a long time.  I took a nice long nap.. about 3 hours.  It was real nice.  I woke up around 5:30 and got ready to do the thing at Kennedy for the Jr. Cougar tournament.  I did the clock twice for the games.  Andy Sabin and I did that 7 and 8 o'clock.  It was pretty easy but boring.  Oh well, after that I sat around like normal and did not much of anything.  I actually played Madden 2002 for my computer for awhile.  I was the Dolphins and I played against the Browns.  I wish I had a controller for my computer because using the keyboard sucks.  Anyways I got the updated 2003 rosters so I had Rikky Williams and everyone on the Dolphins.  I ened up with 5 touchdowns with Williams and around 240 yards.  It was crazy how easy you can get an average of 10 yards per carry.  The game's almost not even fun.  Since that I've just been sitting here playing pool on Yahoo with Whitney.  She kicks my butt every once in awhile and I do pretty good every now and then as well.  That's always fun :-)  Anyways that's pretty much it for today.  Night.

      Hello again.  Just got back from the game.  Sophs won by 12 or something like that.  I played like crap.  Missed a bunch of layups.  Varsity started out well but ended up losing by 10.   urlLink     I ate too much.  I feel fine now, but that's probably because I went to the bathroom.  Oh well.  I'm pretty bored right now.  I don't have much to do.  I think I'll go play some more Xbox later.

      So here I am back from practice.  I suspected it would be practice and I was right.  "Walk-through" doesn't mean walk through it means full speed through.  I can understand if they put practice on the schedule but they didn't.  They put "Walk-through"  From that you may suspect walking trough plays but what happend?  We get chewed for going half speed in a "Walk-through" practice.  Oh well.  So right now I'm just sitting around doing not much of anything and not wanting to go sit on a bus for almost 2 hours.  I think I'm going to go play some Xbox.

      I haven't updated in a few days so I figure why not now, I have a few minutes.  Anyways yesterday was pretty boring.  I'm glad at least everything went ok and I survived.  I was anticipating I might not have survived because I had to give me World History presentation that I ended up finishing right before I left for school.  Talk about putting it right no the line.  Oh well.  Then had practice after school.  I'm glad that went by quick in my mind as I look back.  When practices are over, they don't seem that hard but when in the middle they always seem to be.  I'm about to go to 'walk thru' for the game tonight.  I have no idea what they plan on doing with us for an hour and 15 minutes, but probably just like a normal practice.  I'm not real excited about going to the game which is an hour and 45 minutes away without my CD player.  I don't know if I said this already but it broke a couple days ago.  Now that I think of it I think I did.  Oh well.  So I'm going to have to go the whole way without music.  Then back.  Ehhhhh.  Oh well.  Last night blew.  Was going to go to bond with Whit, but that didn't happen.  So I sat at home and did almost nothing.  I played Xbox for about 3 hours.  Jetistarfighter is pretty fun.  That's about all I did yesterday.

      Today was weird.  I feel fine now which is great but I didn't do much.  Went to church this morning and breakfast at Perkins.  Then went to Wal-mart.  I bought a model.  It's a Audi TT roadster.  It's excellent.  It was a diecast model you put together.  Real nice.  I put it together in a couple minutes and it's now sitting on my desk.  :-)  I wish I had a real TT though.  It would be wicked nice.  Also bought some network cables.  Our home network is now complete.  I hooked my Mom's old computer up with Windows 2000 a couple weeks ago.  I put my old 20 GB hard drive in it and we're now using it as a nice file server that all the computers in the house have access to.  That way I can put my MP3s up on it and everyone can listen to them.  I just wish I had network access in my room.  I don't.  Too bad.  Anyways that's about all I did today.  Peace out.

      I was pretty bored today.  I didn't do much.  I sat around for most of the day.  That's just the way it is when you're sick.  I sat around, played some NBA Live 2003 on Xbox.  I played 3 games.  Lakers are 3-0 in franchise mode so far.  I average almost 50 points a game with Kobe.  I can drive the lane and dunk at will.  The only problem is my defense.  Shooting in the game is so good, it's crazy.  It's easy to nail a jumper with a hand in the face.  The rest of the day I sat in my room and ripped my CD collection onto the laptop.  No internet connection up there so I had to type in all the CD track names and album titles.  It was a good time waster.  I screwed up how I wanted the file names to be thought.  It goes Artist\Album\TrackName.mp3  What I wanted it to be like was Artist\Album\TrackNumber - Artist - TrackName.mp3  Oh well!  Anyways I'm still partially sick.  I've got those eye drops from the doctor.  They seem to be working.  My eyes don't look as blood-shot as the other day.  I still have 2 other perscriptions to take.  I don't know if they're working.  I can't really tell.  I feel better but I have the same symptoms.  Runny nose, that nasty cough and mostly fatigue.  I'm alright to do stuff now I think.  I don't care how I feel on Monday.  I'm going to go to school and to pratice.  I can't be out that long.  And as I'm finishing up here playing pool on Yahoo with Whitney.  Always fun.  I must go to be now though.  Night.

      Basketball sucks.  We lost again.  Varsity lost also.  Tomorrow we have practice.  I'm not particulary interested in going after playing only about 6 minutes in the game tonight.  I'm pissed at hearing stuff at halftime and then not being able to do something for the rest of the game.  No wait, I was supposed to score 10 points and 10 rebs in the actual 10 seconds I played in the second half.  I'm not too excited about it, can you tell?  Whenever we lose, I never seem to think about it more than a few times.  I put it behind me quickly.  I couldn't tell you the last 3 teams we played.  I want to do better, I want to develop as a player.  I'm just sick of all the dumb, stupid and weird stuff.  Oh well.

      And so the parents are off to South Carolina to watch my brother graduate from basic training in the United States Army.  I have to say I'm proud of him.  He's doing something with his life.  After being in the service, he's going to have a fresh start and free of debt.  He gets paid while in training in California.  Most of his expenses are already paid for.  For example food and living.  All of his money he can put in the bank and save.  That along with $50,000 for college when he's done.  Also in his position, after his time (3 years I think, might be 5) they're not going to want to let him go because linguists are hard to get.  So if he stays it's likely they'd pay him a wad.  I think if he enjoys being in the Army atmosphere, he's likely to stay.  If not, then his college is paid for and he can do whatever he wants.  Wow.  Anyways today was so-so.  School is so stressing at times.  Some things are just so screwed up and others so confusing.  Well I'm going to eat my dinner now.

      Today was pretty boring.  Nothing much happened, except I went over to Maria's for lunch.  Yeah, she lives right across the street from the school, so tight.  While we were eating lunch, her new computer showed up via UPS.  Wow, let me tell you, she was happy about that.  "Oh wow, I can print pretty butterflies with it!" "It's the new, I have the new!"  Wow.  Have fun with the new comp, Maria.  Anyways, practice was alright.  Not too bad, really.  My hip hurts a little.  I landed on it during practice and I've got a bruse there from the other night.  So I'm going to speculate it's going to swell up real nice tonight.  Eh, I can deal with the pain..  Played some pool on Yahoo with Whit.  Once again I knock in the 8-ball like the 3rd turn.  Ehh!  Why do I do that!?  My ratings around 1300, I think.  w00t!  I need to go to bed now.  Night.

      Well hello.  Tonight was good.  Sophs and Varisty won.  We won 69-38 and the Varsity won 55-45.  For the first time, I can say I had fun.  I'm pretty sure if we lost, I wouldn't feel the same but oh well!  That's pretty much my story for tonight.  Good night.

      Today was pretty busy.  Didn't have much time to do anything.  I got up around 9 and did some homework.  I didn't do much, but I did do some.  I went in at 1 for some Geometry.  Corrections and stuff to help me get caught up.  I had to walk to school and then walk back.  Then walk back for basketball.  When I got back from doing Geometry, I noticed the door was open.  At first I thought maybe someone broke in.  Then I thought the dogs would be making more noise.  So I didn't even think more about it.  So practice was alright.  Not too exciting.  It never is though.  I worked hard, even though we had to do running because some people didn't know what a jump-stop was.  Things like that piss me off because stupid people can screw off and make us all run.  I try not to worry about it though.  Game tomorrow night at home.  I'm looking to get a win.  Night.

      Well how-d.  Today was pretty good.  :-)  Went to church, went to breakfast like every Sunday.  I get the same thing at Perkins every time.  Supreme burger, cherry coke.  Yum.  Gives me an upset stomach sometimes, like it did today.  Yeah, that wasn't good.  We went home then to Wal-mart and then to Sam's Club.  First time I've been in Sam's Club.  It was exactly as I pictured it.  That was weird.  I think that store is too big though.  I walk all the way to the back by the meat section and I'm already tired of walking.  I suggest they make scooters you can ride around for shoppers and I'm not talking about just for the disabled.  I mean for the extremely lazy people like myself.  Oh well, I got some goods there.  Some Welcher's grape juice and some off the hizzle muffins.  Also got some DVDs.  One of them was  About a Boy .  We watched that this evening.  I thought it was really good.  The Audi TT in the movie = off the hizzle wizzle fo shizzle.  Wow.  I went online to the Audi website and took a look at how much it would cost me a month to buy one.  It ended up being over $700 a month for a 48 month, 1.9 APR, $1000 down financing.  Now that's crazy.  How am I going to come up with that kind of money?  I guess I'm not, or hey I could just plan on winning the lottery.  That or I could deal with the fact that I'm never going to get more than a 1:24 scale die cast Audi TT.  Oh well.  Played about a billion games of pool with Whit tonight.  Always a pleasure.  :-)  Pool is off the hizzle as well.  I ended nicely with a 3 game streak, but I got the 8-ball and cue ball in both so many times... wow.  Tight.. good night.

      Word.  Today was interesting.  1st hour I find out my dang JavaScript script didn't work.  Arg!  I wanted that to work so bad so I could just continue to do almost nothing in that class and get an A.  Here's some advice for you people wanting to get good grades.  Take web design 1, and take web design 2.  If you're decent with computers, it's an easy A!  Woo ya.  Alright.  The rest of the day was just blah blah blah, like normal.  Except maybe for 4th hour where I find out I have to support Fascism.. uhh no joke.  Yeah well maybe that's a little out of context but it's the truth.  We have to come up with propaganda and ways to get people in the class to agree with the ideas of Fascism.  Wow that's great.  How easy is it going to be for the people who have Democracy?  Yeah.  That and we get 5 points automatically off if our team isn't voted the best out of the class.  WTF!?  That's wrong.  I also got picked to write the speech for my group.  I was thinking I could come up with some mock ruler who supports Fascism.  I thought of a name like Rudolph Fitler or something stupid to mock Hitler.  I figure that would get a laugh -- but yeah how can Hitler possibly be funny?  No he can't.  He was just a man with some really whacked out ideas that just somehow led to over 9 million or something people being killed.  Woo -- and I get to advocate his form of government.  Thanks O'dell.  Anyways, my day wasn't really as bad as I make it sound.  I don't suppose that assignment will be that bad after all.  The weekend is almost here and that's the greatest time of the week.  It's a temorary escape from all that causes stress, confusion, discomfort, and pain.  School, I'm convinced, is evil.  Evil not in it's entireity, but the basic principals it supports.  School is a neccessity though.  It seems more often than not that school is just another way for the selected few to get ahead of the others.  The way school is set up, it seems great.  Like communism looks great on paper.  It's just that not everyone is the same and not all people get the same when all is said and done.  It's amazing just how our government is still in one piece.  And wow, I need to give up on this ranting.  So many times I try to justify my opinions when no one will care.  You're not going to see support for the banning of school any time soon, so what the hell am I talking about.  Tomorrow we've got a game against Dub. Senior.  Should be a good one, come out and watch.  I think I'm just a bit tired now.  Good night.

      Today sucked.  Went home early because I was feeling sick.  I still feel like crap.  So much has been going around the school.  A lot of people have been sick, including 2 people on the basketball team just a few days ago.  It really doesn't help.  So I went home after 5th hour.  I had to walk home because no one could pick me up.  It felt like forever walking home.  It seemed like an hour it took me to walk.  Usually it seems like a few minutes, but I was just zonked out.  I got home and the first thing I did was jump in my bed.  I slept for about 4 hours I think.  I wasn't really hungry after that, but I ate some anyways.  I didn't eat lunch so I needed to eat.  I started to feel better after I moved around a bit after sleeping.  It was weird.  My nose feels like a faucet.  I can't get it to stop running.  That's pretty sick.  Anyways, yesterday was pretty good.  We beat Washington over at their place.  Final score was 69-68.  I was happy about that.  I think that's probably when I got what I have now.  There's a lot of guys just recovering from being out.  A lot of stuff floating in the air.  It seems like I've repeated myself, but I don't know.  I feel tired.  I'm going to bed.  Good night.

      And so Saturday didn't turn out so bad after all.  I woke up this morning at around 9.  I scrounged around to find my plain jersey.  We had a horrible game Friday night up in Dub. Hempstead, so the coaches thought we didn't deserve to wear our practice jerseys with the Kennedy name on them.  I have NO response to that.  Ahh, yeah.  So practice wasn't 3 hours and 20 minutes, but it was 3 hours and 5 minutes.  Awesome!  We lifted at the end, so that's what made it a bit longer.  That and we decided to do charge drills when I bruised up my right shin muscle, whatever you may call it.  It's sore now.  Yippee.  That and my left calf muscle is still a little sore.  I don't know what to do now.  So after practice my dad and I drove to McDonald's where I ordered and things in my car.  It was interesting.  That was the 1st time doing that in my car.  Having a car is defiantly a milestone in life.  I feel the responsibilities increasing in my life and the complexity as well.  Not only do I have to remember to lock the doors, but roll the windows up and the parking break and and and and... eh!  It seems to me like I'm ranting about these responsibilities that are not hard to take care of but just seem easy to forget and really just things I've never had to worry about before.  The exact things we talked about, my dad and I.  That makes me think of the discussion about technology we had in world history.  The discussion, or debate you may say, was about whether or not the use of technology has improved the quality of life or not.  To be the devil's advocate, I chose the against technology side.  I did that partially because I knew I could make it funny.  I was with Eric and we make an 'OFFICIAL GRAPH' with 'OFFICIAL DATA' on how the use of technology has greatly increased over time the amount of homework assigned.  As stupid as that is, I believe it's true.  If you think about it, I think you'd agree.  Think if the printing press wasn't invented.  Think if the ink and pen wasn't invented.  Think if the use of the rock wasn't discovered.  Where would we be?  We'd be no where, but we'd be no where without homework.  From a different angle I'd say technology greatly increases the complexity of life.  I know this is true and I know you know this is true.  How many Americans can honestly say they don't have a VCR with '12:00' blinking?  Not many, I think.  While technology seems to make people's lives more interesting, it does make it horribly complex.  I seem to think that without modern technology, life would be much more peaceful.  A lot could be said about that, but I don't intend to finish my thought just yet.  Perhaps you've got ideas, and go ahead and comment.  Anyways that was pretty much my day.  I came home and ate my lunch and then Whit came over and we played Xbox.  We played NBA Live 2003 and I kicked butt.  (Sorry but Ray Allen doesn't compare to Kobe Bryant, Whit... he got game, but not that much game, bahah)  Then we watched the rest of  Joe vs. the Volcano .  That is such a great movie, you don't understand.  I mean  I have no response to that .  We then proceeded to attempt to solve my Rubik's cube.  After many failed attempts, she went home and I was left with the cube in my hand and a horrible headache.  Hmm.  It makes me wonder the intentions of this Rubik guy.  I suppose he could be some madman who was only out to give people headaches trying to solve his silly cube.  Hahahahah Rubik.. the jokes on you because I don't care!@#  ...right now, at least.  I will solve that dang thing, and without help from the internet.  And no I won't peel the stickers off!  So there!  Good night.

      Tonight sucked.  We lost by 3 or 4.  I don't remember the exact score.  I was too busy thinking about the technical foul that was called on Tyler and I sitting on the bench.  The ref said we jumped up and protested a non-call during the game while Kyle went up for a shot and was fouled.  He said we jumped up and stuff.  I really don't want to talk about it anymore because I know I didn't.  I have no idea what the ref saw.  Other than that, the game sucked.  I played about the first 2 minutes then was taken out because I got 2 fouls.  I didn't go back in until the second half when I was only in for about a minute.  During that minute in the second half, I was wide open under the hoop so many times I couldn't count.  I don't know why they couldn't lob it up to me.  I don't even want to think about it right now.  Tomorrow, I'm hoping, will be a much better day.  I'm planning on practice, getting a hair cut and then getting my license.  From then, I plan on going to eat at Pizza Ranch with the gang.  Then going to Whits and playing Techmo Super Bowl until my eyes pop out.  Woo ya!  I can't wait.  That and Tetris!@#  Woo ya.  That's about it for now.  Good night.

      Today was interesting.  Nothing too exciting.  I finally heard Maria's joke... and to be quite honest, I was disappointed.  It really wasn't funny at all.  I either don't get it, or have a really dry sense of humor.  I think it's just a dumb joke.. but that's just me.  Anyways school continues to suck.  Nothing new really.  Just more homework and more boring stuff I'll end up forgetting in 5 years.  I think we need school reform.  I like my idea of 10 years of school, then special education based on what job you plan on focusing on.  I think that makes more sense, becuase the I think the average person does only a few things that has anything to do with their high school education.  Everything else they just forget and ends up being useless.  That's not so true the higher up you go in the job fields, but for the average person I think I'm correct.  The horrible part is that people just look to see that you've completed X schools and gotten X education.  They really don't care if you're a dumbass.  Just as long as you have X education under your belt.  It sucks, I think... but I have no room to speak.  Blah blah blah blah.  School sucks.  I wish I could learn to like it.. but it just sucks.  It gets me so stressed out about everything.  Sometimes it just makes me want to sleep for a week and just detach myself from society.  That's just how stressed I get!  ... and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that way.  Oh well.  I guess I have to live with that.  No sense in complaining if it doesn't do anything.  I'm just like blah blah blah blah.  Wow.  I'm done.  I have nothing more to say.  Tomorrow is Friday and Saturday I get to drive.  Woo, I can't wait.  Then Saturday practice and I get my hair cut.  Then fun playing Nintendo at Whits.  I can't wait to play old Mario.  Wow, what a classic game.  Peace homie.

      The 3rd of next month will be the 1 year anniversary of this blog.  Yay?  Whatever.  It's hardly like anyone reads it except maybe 1 person.  This is when you all comment and say "HEY WTF!@#$ I READ IT TOO!"  Yeah, that's just the way it is.  Anyways my day sucked pretty much.  It wasn't too amazing, to put it in simple words.  I finally go the dang script to work for web design.  Now I'm left with almost nothing to do in the class.  I think I'll just use it to do nothing.  The rest of the day was pretty much the same.  Yeah then I got slapped in the ass.  Hrm... yeah.  Ok.  You know who you are.  Woo ya?  Alright.  That sort of thing doesn't happen everyday.  Then I got to world history and acutally focus on work.  I didn't slack off at all.  I got my study guide and started working on it.  I actually worked on it a bit tonight as well.  I'm going to actually study for this test coming up on Friday.  I think I can do pretty good.  I just can't be lazy like I normally am and just wing it.  So yeah that was alright.  6th hour is always easy.  Then had practice after school which was alright.  That's about it.  I got home and did not much.  I played some Yahoo pool with Whit and won a couple.  I actually won a game for Maria since she left her game against Whit.  Then Whit goes and beats me while I'm on an 8 game streak.  Doh!  Thanks a lot.  I was almost up to 1400.  That pisses me off.  I was missing easy shots too.  Dang, I suck.  Speaking of things that suck, just off the top of my head, school sucks.  I'd now like to compare school with the movie,  Office Space .  I think in this analogy I'm Peter Gibbins and Initech is the school, while my parents are my bosses.  Like Peter was saying, it's not like he is lazy, he just doesn't care.  That's like me but I am lazy.  You see.  I care sometimes, but mainly becuase of my parents (the bosses).  Like Peter was saying, his only motivation is to not get fired.  For me, that's not getting yelled at by the parents.  If I get a better grade, not a dang thing happens to me (not anything bad at least).  So the only motivation is to just not get fired.  I don't know if I can go any further with that and plant a virus in the school's mainframe, but yeah it's a thought.  Anyways that's all I got to say about that.  Peace out homie.

      Last night, I had in mind a lot of stuff that I wanted to get done today, and the day is almost over and I've only done about 2 things I wanted to do.  And bleh.  I have almost nothing left to say.  Maybe I'll think of something later.

      Wow, I suck right now.  I'm so bored.  I have nothing to do.  Too bad Whit is sick.  Wow, I just went outside and tried to make a snowman but I failed miserably.  I wanted to just jump in the snow and fall asleep.  I tried to use this vase thinger in the flower bed.  It was made of styra-foam (sp?) and it broke.  Wow.. I suck and I'm so bored.

      Hey.  Tonight was alright.  Not as I planned, but that was mainly because I slept for about 3 hours after school.  It was supposed to be a nice short nap but it turned into that.  Yeah then Whit and I went to Mr. Movies and we got Fusion Frenzy the Xbox game.  That was alright.  Not extremely fun but it was amusing.  Then we played NBA Live which I just kicked her ass at.  Woo yeah can't touch this.  Back up off thiss.  Yeah.  Then we watched some NBA games.  Philly beat the Magic and then we watched the beginning of the Laker - Spurs game.  Right now there's a minute left and the Spurs are up by 10.  I wonder how it's going to end.  Probably the Spurts.  Kobe is having a great game but everyone else is just sucking.  That's about it.  Tonight was interesting, to say the least.  Night.

      Right.  I'm sitting here right now in first hour doing not much of anything because I can.  Wow.  I'm a winner.  I really should be doing my homework, but I don't feel like it and it seems like I feel like that all the time.  I just don't feel like doing it, so I don't.  I need to wake up and smell the roses or something becuase I can't continue to be this lazy or I'll be screwed.  I'm not sure why I'm so lazy.  I've never thought much about it.  Maybe it is like the Peter Gibbins example.  It's not that I'm lazy, I just don't care.  There are a few reasons why I don't think I'm like that, one being that I do care.  The reason why I care though is so that my parents won't be on my back.  I do want to do good, but sometimes I get stressed out.  Bah, I need to do some work now.

      The typical week.  Wow.  It seems like I've done this a million times.  This is just the million first.  I don't know sometimes why I  type  in this thing... I just talk about my day and it's always boring.  Blah.  What's new... nothing.  We beat Cedar Falls.  Interesting game.  I had an amazing 1 point.  Wow.  That's about it.  Wow.

      word  Updating this can quickly become tedious and repedative.  I remember reading something or hearing something someone said about weblogs and how he or she hates them because they're only about people who don't have lives and just blabber about their problems.  Well to that I say that sometimes people don't have people they can talk about their problems to, or they just can't think of them or... "Go ahead.. make my day"  Ok, I was just watching some Clint Eastwood movie.  Anyways yeah people just blabber and the guy doesn't like this.  To that I say if you don't like it, the I guess you don't have to read it.  I don't know what made me think of that but I just did.  Alright so today was alright, it was good, I think.  Nothing went wrong.  Everything went pretty good except the fact that I have a lot of homework.  I hate homework.  I wish life were easier and we could all get our learning done in class.  People would be so much smarter if that were the case.  Blah blah.  I need to go to bed.  I need to do my homework.  Good night.

      Hello.  Tonight was fun!  w00t.  Alright it goes a little something like this: I wake up around 7:10 and get ready for practice.  I eat a donut and am on my way.  We are on our way, my Dad and I, to Kirkwood to the practice gym.  I've never been to Kirkwood, so yeah that was ok.  Practice was alright, nothing to fancy.  Yelled at and stuff like normal.  I was kind of mad a bit during practice.  I don't know, I normally am.  I think I was  just a bit pissed about the game.  And about the technical -- Will gets suspended.  I think he might have said something, but I don't know.  When coach Green asked Tyler and I about it before we started practice I said I didn't know and didn't notice anything.  I'm not sure if anyone else said anything to him about it.  I just have no idea why he decided to pick Will to blame it on.  Anyways, after practice we went back to Kennedy and lifted weights.  Got done with that, and went home.  Took a shower and went off to the DOT office to get my license.  Woo ya!  I didn't have to take a test.  Boo ya.  Alright.  So yeah I'm cool with my Mazda 626.  After that I hung out at home and slept a bit.  Then Whit and I went over to the mall and we got Super Mario 3.  Woooooo!   It's meeeee Mario!  Aahahhah.  That is hilarious.  We played some Tetris, some Jeopardy, which I sucked at.  The only ones I knew the answer for, I spelt out the answer wrong.  Arrggggh.  We played the Mario.  I sucked at that too, but it was fun.  Then we played some Techmo Super Bowl.  That game is tight.  I kicked ass in that.  I even beat Scott   who is really good at it?  Well I guess not, cos I beat him.  Whooopty doo!  Yeah then Maria arived and we hung out then we picked up Brian and headed over to Pizza Ranch where Peglow works and had some nice pizza there.  It was pretty good.  Most pizza I eat eventually gives me an upset stomach, but this did not.  So that was good.  There were also a few weird people eating there also.  One guy who we thought was about to steal some chairs, but did not.  Then oh, he gets a phone call and Maria acts like she's answering it when she doesn't even have a phone in her hand.  Nice move, then the guy looks at us funny and looks like he's about to murder us all (not really! Ha ha!).  Anyways then we all went over to my house to play Xbox.  That's pretty much when I took over because I cannot be stopped in NBA  Live.  Don't believe Whit when she leaves a comment and says she really beat me because she didn't.  So yeah that was about it.  I had fun!  That is about it.  Good night.

      Tonight was alright.  Sophomores lost to Wash.  Varsity won.  The varsity game was awesome.  You should have seen it.  It was definatly worth the admission.. but I didn't pay for admission.  Yeah.  Ok so it was worth spending your Friday night there.  Anyways today sucked though.  I don't have much to say, because I don't know.  Yeah.. that's about it.  Night.

      Morning  Well I was just reading the headlines at Blogger.com and found that it was purchased by Google.  That's pretty iteresting.  I guess that could mean better bloggin'  Anyways yesterday was a long day.  Pretty boring too.  Game @ Xavier we ended up winning by 2.  I'm glad we won because we got a technical for a very stupid reason.  That combined with the fact that we almost got a second one because the coaches were arguing the call of the first one.  Wow.  I'm just glad we won after all that.  I played alright, but not great.  A couple points but I missed a few free throws.  I guess it's not that bad because we still won the game.  Blah blah.  School is no fun sometimes.  Yeah that time is about now.  I want to go home and sleep at the moment but no I can't.  w00t?!

      Yo  Today was weird.  Woke up and read some newspaper.  Drrr.. that was pretty boring then the rest of the day was blah.  Then we went to Whit's volleyball tournament in Marion.  Maria and Hudson went with me.  It sucked because we got there right after she had a game then we didn't get to see her play because Hudson had to be home at 4.  Drrrr.. blah.  Well tonight was fun.  Went to see 'How to lose a guy in 10 days' with Whit.  It was amusing to say the least.  Funny how they set it up and everything.  It was worth maybe $5 of the $7.50... not the whole deal.  Yeah so that was tight, then we went to Wendy's and got some Frosties.  That was tight.  That's about it.  Yeah, right I'm bored right now.  The weekend is almost over, but it's cool that we don't have tomorrow.  Still have practice though.  I can't wait until spring break.  That's about it.  I'm tired now.  Night.

      Today was interesting.  I finally got my schedule fixed.  It's pretty perfect, I think.  I'm not sure what I could change to make it better.  Today was alright.  Nothing bad really happened.  Last basketball practice was today.  It went alright.  Few times I got frustrated but that's pretty normal.  I'm pretty much just glad it's over.  Now I can finally relax and  maybe catch up on some sleep.  I can't wait.  Tomorrow is Friday and Fridays are always good.  I enjoy weekends very much.  Tomorrow is a big day though because I have to have all my project done and ready to present by 7 AM tomorrow.  It's too bad there's a 0 hour class or otherwise I'd be fine.  I just have to take in my mouse and basically set it up by the display.  Pretty easy but oh well.  That's about it.  Night.

      Finals are over.  That's a relief.  Just a few 'loose ends to tie up' with my Geometry and I'm home free.  Thank God I don't have Bradley next term.  Anyways, other than finals nothing much going on.  Once next  term starts things, I'm hoping, will start to get easier.  It's amazing just how much time you could spend with sports and stuff just added up together.  If I could get homework out of the way in that time, the rest of the day/night would be free.  That would be crazy.  Anyways, that's all for now.  Night.

      I updated last time but it didn't work.  Oh well.  This will be very short.  My weekend was nice.  It went pretty fast, like normal.  Next week is finals week and then end of the term.  I can't wait until after finals.  I can't wait until the 4 days we have off.  I can't wait.  That sums it up for me.  Friday was our last game.  We ended up winning by 2.  Adam had the game winning shot.  It was great.  I'm glad I did ok though.  I started off really bad.  I got took out a few times then the same thing happened in the second half but I did good.  I don't know how to better explain that but I had only 2 fouls and coach Green acted like I had 4 or something.  He took me out when we were on defense and put Shultz in.  I'm a bit bigger than Shultz and that doesn't seem to make sense.  Not to say that he can't play D it's just that I'm sure I could have done better if he would have left me in.  That sucked, but at least we won and I had a season high of 12 points.  w00t.  That's about it folks.  I wish I would have been more productive with my weekend but I must say I'm not worrying and I'm being happy.  Peace out homies.

      Today was interesting.  It seems like I say that quite often, but oh well.  It really was interesting to say the least.  I started off on a bad note.  I woke up around 7:55.  Class starts at 8.  It's a good thing I live so close.  I managed to get ready in about 3 minutes and was only late a minute or two.  Wow, good job me.  I think that's a record.  The only downside I guess was my hair was sticking out a bit on my right side.  No one would notice though.  That sort of thing no one would come out and say.  Anyways.  Gym was boring.  We didn't do anything except get lockers.  I tried my combo a few times and just gave up.  I know I got the numbers right but they're the new lockers and they click and I don't know.  I'll figure it out Thursday, I guess.  I didn't care to figure it out because I was in a 'I don't care' mood.  So that was over then I headed on to Biology.  Biology was alright.  We checked homework from the previous night.  It was super easy.  So that was checked and then we did some notes.  I always get bored when we have notes.  That's the time when I usualy fall asleep.  I was thinking last night that I could get some caffeine before to wake myself up.  I guess that's something I could try.  Then on to 3rd, computer programming.  We're working on some Java stuff.  Not too hard, but it's all out of this online book that's hard to follow.  It's pretty boring right now.  Mr. Beall is having to teach us and the AP students.  So we get lost and go through 20 minutes of debugging our first program.  Woo, yay!  Not too bad I guess... better than some other boring class.  Then on to World History.  We got our books today.  1st term I remember getting fined for the edges of my book being bent when I turned it in.  $5 for that dang thing.  That's the sort of thing you pay for at the end of the year, but no O'dell had to charge me for some stupid bent edges that happens so easily when you have 2 or 3 books in your bag at a time along with 5 binders pressing up on them to the lining of your bag.  I'm not sure why this is such a big deal, but it just ticked me off.  I was sure to write on the book that I got it with bent edges.  So yeah.  I even told the people around me to be my witnesses if he decided to charge me $5 again for it.  So yeah, I'm taking it to court if he does.  Yeah, then off to lunch.  I must say I like the new lunch periods.  They're much easier, I have to say.  A lot quicker to get food and you don't have to fight to get a seat (at least at the table I used to sit at).  Now I guess it doesn't matter because all the tables are in a big line.  Yeah, then Chris Tolley (Freshman) comes and sits by me.  He sat by me on Monday as well.  This kid bugs me.  He used to be in the same after school program with me back in 8th grade at Harding.  The kind just bugs me.  He's at least 14 years old (I think) and he acts like he's about 6.  Thinking first about his feelings, I've always been as nice to him as I possibly could.  The only problem I have with him is that he wines one minute about something (almost crying) and then the next minute hes swearing and acting like he's some badass bully.  Almost like that mental kid that raps Eminem.  The thing about Tolley is that he seems to think he can come to me for simpathy.  I have no problem, I guess, but it's just annoying.  I wish I could just tell this kid to grow up!  So blah!  Yeah after lunch, went back to World History.  Boring, and we get a worksheet with like 40 problems on it due Friday.  Tight.  I'll be doing that Thursday night, thank you very much.  On to LA 10.  Watched a movie.  Wasn't too bad.  Yeah blah.  Couple people sitting by me got yelled at for talking too much.  After someone gets yelled at by Mrs. Frye, there's always an awkward silence where no one moves and then she just goes on talking like her normal joyful self and then it's all weird.  Then on to Geometry.  I'm glad I don't have Bradley.  She has to know by now that I don't have her this term.  I didn't bother to tell her after taking my final.  I guess I just left her to assume I didn't switch.  Too freaking bad.  Fitz is alright.  She's a lot nicer than Bradley, let us say that for sure.  So far it isn't too bad.  The only real problem is that Jory sits right next to me.  The kid makes me laugh about every 2 minutes.  The other day he was making a noise so I look over by his desk to see him drooling with his mouth wide open all over his desk.  Wow.  Good job.  The kid cracks me up... in a sick way.  I hope he just stops being funny for once so I can concentrate?  So yeah.  Walked home and that was it.  Later on I went back to the school and shot around.  I'll be playing in an AAU team with some guys from the Kennedy team soon.  So a few of them were there and we played some games.  Was fun.  Dunked it a few times (not during the games) w00t!  On one play though I jammed my finger pretty bad and it's swolen right now.  So that sucks.  That was my whole day.  Hope you enjoyed my pointless rant about book edges, and my swolen finger.  I hope tomorrow is better.  Don't have a first hour.  Tight.  So good night.

      Tonight was fun.  Spent a lot of time playing Xbox with Whitney.  Hah!  I beat her so bad at NBA Live.  Don't listen to her comments.  Then we played Shenmue II.  That game is really boring.  I don't know why we were playing it.  I guess it was a good conversation piece.  We were just making fun of everything in the game and it was kind of funny.  The games boring though because you find out some stuff about some people then you ask other people and go to places to get info and do this and that.  Oh yeah and those things involve moving books around, scrubbing walls, and catching a leaf falling from a tree with two fingers (on the same hand, side by side).  Wow.  My eyes were bugging out on that one.  I'm going to get that one tomorrow morning I assure you.  Well I had fun though.  Mucg better than just sitting around and watching TV by myself.  :-)  Monday is going to be weird.  I don't want to go back.  :-/

      Weekends always seem to go quick and this weekend was no exception.  Friday was nice.  Went out to eat with Whit.  That was fun.  We went over to her house and played some video games but them I decided I was bored with that, hah.. and we decided to rent a movie.  We got Changing Lanes.  It was pretty good.  I already saw it but I didn’t mind seeing it again.  It was a good movie.  We played some pool and I kicked but.  Then did some putting and I decided to become the next Tiger Woods.  I made like 3 long distance putts in a row so then I decided to go pro.  Bahahah.  Good one.  Yesterday had fun watching Whit’s team kick some ass at the volleyball tournament up at Kennedy.  That was pretty tight.  I was surprised at how fun volleyball is to watch.  So yeah her team won, and that was tight.  Then last night I watched Stealing Harvard.  That movie was pretty funny.  Tom Green is so funny.  I crack up at the line where he’s like “And that’s when we go in and we take the monnneeey!”  Bahah.. it must be just the way he says money in that line.  So yeah that was tight.  Today I really didn’t do anything.  Watched some tv and that’s about it.  Sundays are pretty boring.  Always sucks the day before going back to school.  So today was boring.  Night.

      Another boring day to add to my spring break.  I never do anything during the day.  Why am I so boring?  Why am I so boring?!  Tonight was fun, however.  I went bowling with Greg, Hudson and Whit.  I kicked ass in the first game and came pretty close to winning in the second one.  Me a pro bowler... probably not.   urlLink     That was pretty much my day, really.  I don't know what else to say.  Night?

      Spring break is finally here.  Tomorrow if the first official day of spring break.  Yay for that I guess.  I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do with all the free time.  It's amazing.  I guess I'll just sleep in until noon and then watch TV all day.  Sounds like a plan.  This weekend was alright.  Hung out at Whits on Friday.  Then Saturday morning had the AAU tourney at Kennedy.  We lost all 4 games that day.  The bad part was that we had to play all our games in a row.  We didn't have enough guys to play two seprate teams so we combined them and played 4 games in a row.  I was pretty gased after the first two games.  Dang.  After that I just was lazy all day then went over to Whits and watched another movie.  I got my butt kicked in pool, but who cares!?  I'm going to be a pro golfer anyways.  (kidding)  Today we had another two games at Kennedy.  We lost those two as well.  That sucked.  That's alright though, I'm kind of just glad it's over and I can begin to relax and enjoy a bit of my spring break.  So yeah that was that.  Tomorrow I'm going to apply for a job at Best Buy.  I figure since I won't be playing sports I could at least work some and save up some money.  My first time applying for a job.  I think it's a pretty good bet becuase I know the manager real well and he told my parents there's an opening in the computer department.  So w00t.  I'll be bring in some cash money and getting major discounts.  Tight.  That's about all that's been happening.  I think I'm going to go to bed now.  Peace out.

      It's been a few days since I last updated.  A lot of stuff has gone down in the last few days.  Good and bad.  Sometimes I just don't know what to say about these things.  I don't feel like talking about all of them anyways.  I don't know what to say now.  I think I'm going to go to bed and thinking about stuff and things.. you know what I mean.  I don't know why I'm posting this.. I'm not saying anything at all.  I guess just to let you know I'm still alive.  I don't know.  More later... maybe.

      Something, I don't know what, just made me think about what I would do if I had the choice of a superpower.  Now most men out there (the ones with higher levels of testosterone) would probably choose x-ray vision.  Right.  That would only get you so far.  Now if you asked me, I would say the ability to speed read, or the ability to touch a book, and know everything in it.  Think of the endless possibilities.  You could be a human library.  You could read every book in the world and tell everyone what they're about.  You could research this and that, in seconds and know everything there is to know.  What happens if you forgot something?  Oh, just touch the book again and bam it's back in your head.  So that's my pick for a superpower, I think.  I really can't think of anything better.  Post your comments and your picks if you had the choice of a superpower.  And you can't have more than one, like Superman, sorry.

      This weekend was boring, mostly.  Nothing much happening.  I'm not looking forward to school tomorrow, but maybe it will be canceled!  Friday, I didn't do anything.. that I remember, at least.  No wait I had an interview at Best Buy.  I think it went pretty good.  I have another interview Thursday.  Saturday, nothing really, except Whit came over and I beat her in NBA Live 2003 best of 3.  I won the first two games.  She will make a comment that she was tired and that she only had 2 hours of sleep.  Don't believe her.  It's all a big cover for the fact that I beat her fair and square.  Yeah.  Detroit what?  Didn't think so...  Sunday went and played 2 games in Independence.  That was alright.  We lost the first game by 1.  We won the second game by 1.  Pretty close stuff.. yeah.  That was my weekend.  Boring.  Hopefully this week will go faster and maybe I'll have something to do next weekend.  Peace.

      Well, here I am sitting in the Findlay Inn conference room on a blazing fast DSL connection.  Now I'm owning some serious burrgers.  Yes.  So what's up lately?  Really nothing.  We've been meeting up with everyone.  Almost everyone is here.  There are still a few people who have not arived yet.  I think tomorrow my brother is showing up.  That makes sense because he has to be doing all his Army stuff.  Yeah.  But he'll be here though.  Other than that I've been hanging out mostly.  Today we went around and looked at the university.  After that I hung around the hotel and watched TV.  I suppose I should probably get some homework done.  I think I might try doing some tonight or something.  That might be a good idea.  I have plunty to do...  I should be getting off here.  I need to go to the wedding rehearsal in an hour and a half.

      As I type, I am probably being charged an outragious amount for the long distance here in this hotel.  I'm kinda just glad I could get online though.  Kinda weird.  So anyways got here yesterday and everything's tight.  Haven't done much.  Everyone else is getting here tonight.  I should probably go now though!

      Today was mostly boring.  Gym was boring like usual.  Bio was boring as well.  We took notes again and worked on the packet that's due Wednesday.  I won't be at school Wednesday, Thursday or Friday then Monday either.  Boo yeah.  Right.  I'm going to my sister's wedding in Ohio.  It's going to be tight, I think.  I'm taking my camera of course.  I'll take pictures, yo.  So tomorrow will most likely be boring.  It will be the last school day of the week.  Wednesday we leave for Ohio and it will take us most of the day to get there.  It's going to be fun, I think.  Hopefully I'll have fun staying at the hotel and stuff.  I'm going to take a lot of pictures, for sure! :-)  I'm thinking I might go to be early tonight.  I didn't sleep much last night and that sucked.  So night.

      Today I finished up my system in my car.  It's pretty tight except the CD player skips a lot.  I got a Pioner deck and equalizer and some SoundStream amps as well as another Technic amp.  Pretty nice I think.  While installing it, I took a few pictures.  You can see them  urlLink  here .  Enjoy.

      So I haven't updated in a few days.  Well actually like a week, but who keeps track.  So anyways school is almost over.  About 6 weeks left.  Boo-yeah.  The summber will own serious burgers.  Let me tell you.  This weekend has been fun so far.  Friday was a half day.  After school I lifted and then after a while I went over to Whit's and watched The Goonies because I hadn't seen it and Whit wanted me to watch it.  And we watched The Matrix because she hadn't seen it and it was tight.  Today I spend most of the day trying to install an old stereo system into my Mazda.  It looks pretty cool so far, I think.  The only main problem is that it skips and stuff.  I think we're going to have to get a new deck for it.  The amps are pretty tight and stuff.  Everything works.  We need to install some high freq. speakers in the front tomorrow.  Should be fun.  I'll be bumpin' in no time.  So tonight Whit came over and we watched Hackers.  If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on one of the most nerdy computer movies ever made.  It's almost up there with Revenge of the Nerds... seriously.  So I'm about to fall asleep here, so I should be getting to bed.  Night.

      Howdy.  Today was interesting to say the least I think.  I started off by failing my biology test.  I pretty much know I failed it.  Don't ask.  I'm screwed.  It kind of sucks though that I missed so much for the wedding but I'm not going to say anything more about it.  I could have worked harder.  I guess lesson learned and I move on.  Well today was an alright day.  Nothing really big.  During 2nd hour though outside went completely dark which was weird.  It later lightened up but everything seems weird inside when it gets dark outside.  Normally you expect it to be light outside and then you get some natural light but when it went dark outside, it was just weird.  I don't know.  But anyways in Intro Comp Prog today we had some assignments to do.  I actually got two done and theres only 5 and Beall said there should be about 1 a day... So dang I'm ahead of schedule but at the same time not because I haven't made up my test yet.  Boo.  But at least I understand some of the While and If commands.  Thanks to Andrew who sits next to me.  Yeah, I'm not a computer genius like everyone thinks.  It's about time I break out of that stereotype.  Thanks.  But I should be getting to bed.  I'm tired now.  I hope tomorrow is better than today was.. But not to say today was bad.  I just want tomorrow to be better I guess.  Night.

      Well my last post didn't work because I'm using a new program to update my blog.  It makes it so I don't have to go to the website anymore to post.  It's pretty convient.  I suppose I'll just have to retype it all.  It wasn't that long though so no big deal.  Blah blah blah.  Yeah the wedding was good.  Everything went fine.  The wedding and the reception.  The food was good as well.  I was kind of dumb though I ate while going back to the reception.  But I should be doing homework and stuff.  I need to go pick up my mouse and Xbox at Whit's.  I let her borrow it so she could practice NBA Live 2003.  She needs the practice let me tell you... bhah.  Yeah.  I doubt she can beat me now though.  It's almost like the one weekend I bought Kobe Bryant's NBA Courtside.  I bought the game on Friday and played it all week while my brother was gone, and when he got back, he played me a few times and he couldn't beat me.  I had the game mastered in two days.  Bahahah.  That's kind of what it's like when I play Whit!  She doesn't have a chance!  Bahahah.  But anyways I need to go.  Peace.

      Yo.  Pretty much a typical day, I'd say.  I'm feeling the homework level going down for me, which is good.  The stress is going down as the homework does too.  I really feel for the people going through a lot of stuff :-\  The school year is almost over!  Dang it's gone really fast.  I never thought it would go this fast but it did.  Wow.  We have like 3 weeks or something?  That's awesome.  So I think I'm going to do my homework now.  It's not 11 o'clock.  This is amazing.   Listening to: Jurassic 5 - "Woe Is Me"

      Today was a different day.  I wasn't feeling well this morning so I decided to stay home.  I spend the first half of the day watching TV and that was about it.  The second half of the day I spent reading a complete chapter in my World History book and typing notes on it.  By the way you can print them off too because I'm super nice and I posted them on my site.   urlLink Chapter 18 Notes   If you're the kind of person, like me, who waits until the last second to study for a test... Or doesn't even study at all, I wouldn't suggest just scanning these notes.  From what I see on the study guide, the test doesn't look all that easy.  I think it helps to reread the chapter and make your own notes.  But that's just my opinion.  But other than that, mostly today was nothing big.  I did though, watch a bit of C-SPAN on TV.  It's interesting the things they talk about and what they talk about.  I was watching the House talk about authorizing naming a post office building after a post office employee died.  May sound boring, but was interesting, I think.  Maybe tomorrow, I will actually get homework done the same way I did today.  Lets hope so.   Listening to:  - "Coldplay - Trouble (Live)"

      Well I don't remember if I said this last night but here goes.  Last night while I was surfing I found a cool weblog directory.  I took the time to register my blog here and I think anyone reading this with a blog should do the same.  The site is called  urlLink eatonweb portal .  It's pretty much a huge weblog directory and you can search by topic and region etc.  It's pretty cool really.  I everyone to register because it's cool to read peoples blogs from around here.

      I must say that the Internet never fails to amuse me.  I just spent about an hour browsing peoples weblogs.  To say the least, it's pretty interesting.  It makes me wonder who looks at weblogs.  The overwhelming theme of each entry is something like this: "Sorry I haven't posted in so long."  The weird thing is that I see myself doing the same thing.  After just searching for "definition of a weblog" I came across  urlLink this  essay.  After reading that and surfing to many of the linked sites in the essay, I went in to what I like to call (or just came up with now) the 'mood of awareness' where I realize that the world I live in is truly huge!  Another site I would like to mention is the wonderful  urlLink OurDocuments  government site.  This site has 100 of the most influential documents in the history of the United States.  Just browsing this site was a treat.  Highly recommended if you're as bored as I was when I found it.  Hah.

      Lakers lost.  1) Kobe was fouled earlier in the game from the 3 line.  Would have been 3 shots and would not have been a pair of foul shots for the Spurs.  2) Kobe should have shot the 3 at the end.  He was about to be fouled.  He's about an 80% free throw shooter.  That would have been at least 2 makes of 3.  Tie game... overtime.  Kobe was hot in the 4th... Spurs were cold.  Lakers would have won.  3) Kobe shouldn't have passed to Horry... he didn't... and still hasn't made a single 3-pointer in the whole series.  Damn!  Lakers are gonna have to win 2.  They can do it.

      Yo, what's goin' on folks.  Nothing much right now.  Currently I'm waiting for files to upload.  I'm uploding some pictures for SeeThesePhotos.  Some of you might know the website.  Good for you.  If you don't, well I'll tell you.  It's basically a website to buy pictures of sports events my Dad takes pictures of.  Currently I'm working for him getting pictures uploaded when people request things from the archive... so yeah that's what I'm doing.  Fun stuff.  Watched the Laker game today.  It was a good one.  Lakers were down by as much as 16 in the 2nd.  Lakers came back while Tim Duncan was in foul trouble.  Too bad for the Spurs, the Lakers are back!  Hahah.  But the next game is in San Antonio at 8:30 on Tuesday.  The Lakers are yet to win a game in San Antonio, so it should be a good game.  Go Lakers.  Other than that, mostly... I haven't been up to much.  Peace.   Listening to: Linkin Park - "KYUR4 TH ICH"

      All I can say now is that my life is getting quite repetitive.  I get up in the morning... Or wait until the last minute and get up in the morning.  I don't eat breakfast.  I go to school and am bored.  I am hungry by 3rd hour.  4th hour rolls around and lunch.  5th hour and 6th.  6th's much different though because I've got Curt and Jory to amuse me.  Weirdos.  Yeah today Curt decides to wrap toilet paper around Jory.  Nice.  Then weight lifting every other day.  When I get home I do the same thing.  Watch an hour of Seinfeld and then some other programming.  Eat some dinner then more TV.  I usually check online bulletin boards and avoid doing my homework.  By then it's about 10-11:30.  Then, if I have to do homework, I do.  If it's something I can put off more, then I do.  My life is beginning to become pathetic.  And by the time the weekend rolls around I usually sit around and do nothing but instead of regular dinner we usually have pizza every once and a while on Friday's and I end up checking boards all day/night and playing video games all weekend.  I don't have a job.  I don't have many friends.  I don't do things on weekends.  All I do is avoid homework and play sports.  What the hell?  I would say I could pass for the typical jock minus the social life.  I suck.

      Nothing much to talk about I don't think.  The Lakers lost.  They're out of the playoffs.  I was pissed about that... but I'm pretty much over it.  I can bet you Kobe is pissed and is gonna own it up next year.  From what I understand the Mavs play the Spurs tonight.  I'm going to bet on the Spurs because I think the Mavs are a lot like the Lakers.  We'll see how that one goes.  Other than that I really don't have much to say.  I've been bored mostly lately.  No basketball, or anything just off-season lifting and stuff.  School sucks as usual.  Oh well.  Peace.   Listening to: Beethoven - "Presto Agitato"

I hope I just don't fail any.  That would be great.  I'm all positive stuff here!  Bah.

      Well today was the first day of finals.  I started off getting to school late for 2nd hour.  Oh well.  The Biology final was pretty simple I thought.  A bunch of multiple choice questions and a few short answer questions.  Then there was the Computer Programming final which was easy I thought.  Then I lifted and shot around a bit.  Yep that was fun.  Tomorrow World History, LA, and Geometry.  Yeah... sweet.

      So the first day of finals is tomorrow.  Then afterwords I have to go to weight lifting.  Fun.  Today was alright.. nothing to serious.  First hour was fun... we did nothing in gym.  After turning in my locker, I ran home and got my car.  I literally went home and got my car and drove back.  That was tight.  I managed to do it all in less than 10 minutes.  I'm quick... like a cat?  Yeah that was tight.  The only downside was that I picked the wrong place to park because the busses blocked me in so I had to wait like 10 minutes.  It wasn't too bad though I got to actually listen to some music in my stereo.  It was doing some weird things while I was driving to school, but it seemed to work itself out because there wasn't anything wrong with it then.  So yeah I came home today and just sat around then went to Best Buy and got the new Staind CD.  I kind of forgot the new Deftones CD is out as well.  Didn't even see that.  I'll have to get that next week.  Tomorrow is 2 finals.  I don't have to go in until 9:45 which is tight.  I'll be able to sleep a lot.  Fun.  That or I'll watch the Price is Right or something in the morning.  :-)  Yep, that's about it.   Listening to: Staind - "Price to Pay"

      The last week of school starts tomorrow.  I'm excited for it to end.  It seems like this year has really gone fast.  I can't say I'm mad but that's just the way it always feels when the year is over.  These last few days will probably be the longest.  Let's hope the teachers don't give us much homework.  So today was interesting my Dad and I bought a boat.  Here are some pictures.   urlLink      urlLink     The engine doesn't work so we had to pull that out.  Hopefully we'll be able to find a cheap one and we're hoping to get one in there in the next couple weeks so we can go fishing!

      I am listening to: "Traffic in the Sky" by Jack Johnson  Here I am sitting in the same chair, in the same shorts and shirt listening to the new music on the seemingly new computer.  What have I done?  I have formatted my old hard drive and started fresh, installing every application I use on a regular basis.  What's the result of this?  A great feeling.  I suppose it's the feeling similar to buying a new car.  Everything about it is well tuned, in excellent condition.  If you spend a lot of time using the computer, you know what I'm talking about :-)  So today was ok after all.  Last night I spent most of my time in bed listeing to  urlLink Coast to Coast AM  and wondering if my parents would get mad if I got up one more time to get something to drink.  The reason why I was worried about this is because I didn't get to bed until around 2 am.  I listened to Barbara Simpson interview a guy who wrote several books about random secrets.  Some examples they talked about were the ingredients in Coke, KFC chicken, and stuff like that.  It was really interesting.  So I guess that could be one of the reasons I couldn't get to sleep.  My mind was just too stimulated.  I spent most of today just sitting around, however.  But later this afternoon I started to format my old 6.4GB hard drive.  I put Windows 2000 on it and all my favorite applications.  Only took me a few hours and I'm glad I did it.  I think one of the reasons why I got through it was because I would constantly go upstairs and watch this interesting History Channel (or might have been TLC) program about robots.  I guess that kept me from going amazingly bored.  Tomorrow basketball camp begins.  I hope that it's not as bad as I remember it being last year.  From what I remember my feet were really killing me from all the running and my legs equally sore.  We'll just have to see how it goes.  I'm actually excited for basketball next season.  I'm more into it now, I guess.

      I haven't updated in a few days so I figure I should.  I don't see any eventual point to this anymore, but what the hey!  Most of my time is spent making sure mosquietos don't bite me.  No wait..  right.  On a serious note... mosquietos suck.  Literally.  What's interesting about them, from my research is that only the female mosquetos suck your blood.  Interesting, I guess.  Further proof that women suck... (thahahhah... pun intended).  Other research points out that there's over 2500 different species of mosquitoes around the world.  But only around 200 of those are in the US.  If you didn't know... these motha truckas look like this:    But another interesting fact is that they have their own magazine.  It's called "Wing Beat."  Funny eh?  Right.  So most of the time I'm playing basetball.  Like this weekend, just today we went up to Iowa City West and played a few scrimmages.  And tomorrow, we're going to Cornell for a tournament.  Should be cool, I think.  We'll see.  I am listening to: "Clocks" by Coldplay

      Well I never got to fixing w.blogger or starting on a new design.  Today I woke up around 6:30 and went to lift.  I got home around 8:30 and sat around and watched some TV.  Then I went off to an individual workout at 10.  It was alright.  Could have been better but it doesn't matter now... it's over.  Now there's nothing going on until Monday next week.  This weekend will be tight.  Tonight there's the basketball BBQ which will be interesting.  Now for a completely random picture.     Peace out.

      Apparently BLOGGER updated their services and I can't use w.blogger (program).  I guess that's OK thought because the new interface is tight.  I'd like to upgrade to BLOGGER PRO but I don't have money to at the moment.  Well I'm in the process of a complete redesign of my page.  I have no ideas at the moment but we'll see.  I'm interested in making a section for photos and videos and maybe some other interesting sections based on the things that occur when you're bored out of your mind during the summer.  I'd like to get out the video camera and take some video if I could.  We'll see how quickly I get a new design up.

      Howdy.  I'm just kind of sitting here not doing much.  I see RoboCop 1 is on the movie channel here.  I'm thinking I'm going to go watch that when I'm done here.  Today and then tonight was pretty boring.  Sat around most of the day.  Applied at Target.  Would be nice if I could get a job and get the new Sony ultraportable laptop coming out this month.  It's awesome.  Yeah.. if I don't get it for my birthday (probably not going to happen), I guess I'll just have to earn up for it the old fashion way.  In other news... Seinfeld rocks.  I'm going to try to archive the complete episode guide.  That would be tight.  I guess that or wait until they bring them out on DVD... which may never happen.  In other news  urlLink Elane  is hot.  There you have it.  I think I'm going to watch RoboCop now... or just go to bed.  Night.  I am listening to: " I Know What You Want (Radio Edit) (HitzRadio.com) " by  Busta Rhymes & Mariah Carey featuring The Flipmode Squad

      I was watching this movie that was supposed to be a reality TV show.  To say the least... this show was off the wall.  The objective of the show was to kill everyone else... and be declared the champ.  So if you're playing you're trying to kill or be killed.  It was the weirdest movie I've ever seen... I think.  Wow.  I am listening to: " When I'm Gone " by  3 Doors Down

      Evening.  Today I really didn't do much.  I sat around mostly.  Yep.  I didn't even leave the house once.  Sat around.  Tomorrow I'm going to be going to weight lifting and then probably nothing once again.  Fun.  I am listening to: "Sleep Alone" by Moby

      Yea, sure I'll update.  The 4th was alright.  Went out on the boat to watch the fireworks.  They were pretty cool.  Blah.  That was about it.  Today went out to shoot some trap.  That was alright.  Pretty crowded.  Yeah.  So next time we'll have to go when it's not so crowded.  Yep.

      Not much going on tonight.  Not really much going on at all.  I had a dream last night that I met LeBron James.  He was tight, but he took a liking to my brother more so than me.  I got him to sign my shirt.  I first asked him to sign my hat, but decided against that becuase it was an L.A. Lakers cap.  That was weird.  Pretty much all I did today was sit around.  Oh yeah I went to weight lifting this morning.  That was it.  Then tonight I decided to download 50 or so episodes of Seinfeld.  I have over 100 now.  I should have them all downloaded by the end of the weekend.  Then I guess I'll figure out a way to hook my computer up to my TV and watch them in a Seinfeld marithon.  That should be interesting.  Well I think I'm going to bed.  I have basketball at Kennedy all day tomorrow.  I am listening to: " Girls Dem Suga (Radiostorm.com: HIP-HOP R&B) " by  Beanie Man

      Hey... not much going on.  Today I actually have a day off.  If you don't count weight lifting, that is.  Hopefully I can do something tonight to render my day anything other than pointless!  But today I've done a bunch of sitting around.  Fun.  Actually my Counter-Strike WON ID is not coming through so I can't play.  That would be the major reason why I'm blogging.  I really don't have much to say.  Right... so I applied at 3 more places.  Actually 2 but the third only hires people over 18.  l33t.  Apparently the YMCA and Target don't need any help... no luck there.  I'm running out of time here... I don't think I'm going to be getting a job this summer.  In other news, my instant messenger has been on for almost 5 days.  That's a long time... right.  Brett says it won't do 10 days.  I plan to prove him wrong.  Hopefully it won't bomb out.  What am I doing... nothing really.  Looking at the Team 3D website and listening to Jurassic 5.  I am listening to: " Concrete Schoolyard " by  Jurassic 5

      I am listening to: "I Could Die For You" by Red Hot Chili Peppers  I like this song.  Cool guitar part.  I imagine if I wanted to play guitar it would be a good song to play.  Not too fancy.. but still cool.  Nevermind now.. I'm listening to something else.  What have I been doing.  Not much really.  Played some basketball today.  Beat Washington.  That was fun.  I played a lot with those guys in AAU stuff.  They were missing a lot of guys, but who cares.  What else is going on?  Right now I'm uploading some pictures for  urlLink SeeThesePhotos .  Pretty cool, I guess.  I'm glad I'm getting around to uploading.  I'm also going to start uploading my pictures to a different account so everyone can purchase my pictures.  A bit easier than deviantart... but I still love DA.  I don't get any comments on DA anymore.  I'm clueless as to why.  I think my stuff's decent.  Maybe people think differently.  I guess I kind of forgot about my plan to redesign my page.  I'm guessing I'll never get to that soon.  I need to learn some PHP or ASP or something.  I always find books confusing and not thorough enough to completely understand.  Sometimes books are not written well and you learn things in a bad way.  Hard to understand if you've never programmed anything.  I guess I can compare it to driving.  When you first start, if you get bad habits... You never seem to forget them.  Or at least they're hard to get rid of.  The problem with good books is that they teach you the right way, but that seems so tedious.  I remember reading Visual Basic books... And when I wrote code, I'd comment on every line.  I got the idea that comments were crucial.  I would write 100 lines of code and just delete it a week later.  Hours and hours of work and commenting gone.  I've never learned that sometimes you just have to say "Go" and dig in... And figure out details later.  Well yeah...  I don't think I'm doing anything tomorrow other than weight lifting in the morning.  Perhaps I could open that PHP book up and give it a try again.  Another thing before I log off this...  It drives me up the wall (Nah, not exactly, but that seemed correct to say) when people pollute my desk area and go away.. And act like they had nothing to do with it!  Right now on my desk is 1, 2, 3, 4 soda cans... 1 is mine... 1 cup which is dripping water all over the sides... And half empty bag of Cheetos (crunchy Cheetos, if you're curious), a bowl that's empty... And a back scratcher.  That and an empty mouse cage.  Fun.  I'm going to clean this up now.  Night.

      Big storm since I last posted.  Power went out for around 24 hours.  Huge tree landed in the bathroom... almost.  Right next to it.  Then I formatted my computer.  Clean install.  Awesome.  Went to Simpson Team Camp.  That was interesting.  We went 9-6 I think.  Yep.  I'm done   [Watching:  706 - The Soup Nazi.rm  -  Seinfeld  -  (21:37)]

      Everything's pretty much the same as I last updated.  It's just that tomorrow is Friday and the first weekend since the school year started.  Despite all the half days... this has been the longest week in a long time.  I watched some VMA's tonight.  Coldplay actually won.  I was happy about that.  I was more surprised really.  Kind of weird how much people like Justin Timberlake had to say about them.  So that was tight.  Umm yeah I don't know what I'm going to do this weekend.  Probably sit around like I always do.  I don't know what else to do... honestly.  So I'll sit home tomorrow and probably the rest of the weekend.  I think TBS has a special on Memorial Day where they're playing a much of Martin Lawrence movies.  I'll probably watch that.  Fun.  I don't know.  -19640.77 -1965.76

I'm used to it!  Oh well.  School's alright.  I'd much rather it be over... but I have no control over that.  -19640.77 -1965.76

      Well I'm pretty bored right now so I thought I'd post.  It's been forever since I started this blog and I don't even know why I started it.  I'm not even sure that people read it anymore.  My posts.. I know get boring.  Maybe that has something to do with no one visiting.  Right now I'm talking to my good friend from Ohio.  His name is Evan.  He's a good guy.  It's really too bad that I had to move.  It's weird though because right now I've known him longer online than in real life.  It's been about 4 years since I last saw him.  It's crazy that we even talk at all.  Anyways I just saw the new Dave Matthews video... "Gravedigger"  It's pretty cool... but weird.  I don't have anything else to say.  I sitll have homework left which sucks.  Oh well... homework does suck!  Blah blah blah...

       urlLink     Well today was ok.  Started off bad and was pretty bad from there out but the day ended fairly quickly.  I woke up around 6:20 and then fell back to sleep.  Woke up at 7.  I didn't feel good at all.  But I decided that I should go to school anyways because I don't want to miss anything this early into the year.  So I toughed it out... even though it probably wasn't that bad compared to I don't know what... but I was probably just being a wimp by other people's standards.  I still feel pretty crappy.  Sore throat and a cold like no other.  I feel pretty hot down here.  I don't know if it's just me or it really is hot down here.  I'm going to go get a fan.  The fan makes my computer screen flicker.  Fun.  I moved it but now it's ok.  When I update this thing with my every move... I make it sound boring and the way a lot of people write their blog.  It's annoying.  Anyways though I forgot what I was talking about so I'm going to just end it right there.  Incubus - Wish You Were Here  -19615.77 -1940.76

       urlLink     Today was alright.  It seems like things go unnoticed during the day because you're awake and up and about.  People are around and you don't think as much.  But for me... Whenever it gets dark and there are not as many people around... Then things get more depressing.  It's just the way things are when you're alone.  Today we went to church.  Went to Perkins.  Went to Target.  Got some Legos.  Legos are wonderful.  I'm starting back up with my Legos.  We also got a TiVo at Best Buy.  A little confusing to set up.  Moved the Xbox back here downstairs.  The Xbox Live works with it down here too.  I think I'll play it more now.  My throat still hurts.  It began to hurt on Saturday morning.  Hasn't stopped since.  I can feel the flem in my throat... So I know that theres some buildup in there.  Sorry to disgust you if you're reading this.  I don't really have much more to say.  School begins back up on Tuesday.  Tomorrow is Labor Day.  I plan on sitting around and doing nothing.  -19640.77 -1965.76

I would talk about how I think it sucks for the school to issue more parking permits than there are spaces, but whoops I already did just spill it all right there.  That does suck.  You have to get there at about 6:40 to get a decent spot.  Maybe I'll just say screw it all and move to Postville.  I don't have any friends that go to Kennedy, anyways!  Hah.

      Oh wow, am I bored.  I have a lot of homework to do, like I normally do on Sunday nights, but at the moment I do not feel like doing it.  I have an unusual pain just below my stomach to the right.  My thoughts are that my appendix is going to explode, but I can’t be sure.  This weekend I spend a lot of Saturday rearranging my the computer area in my house.  I now have a desk and not a corner part.  I like it much more because I am not angled.  I am looking in the direction of the wall instead of an angle on the corner that I hate.  I always bumped my knee on the sharp under parts of the metal support structure thing a mah-bobbers.  I don’t know what you would call them, but the cut I got from it gave me a nice scar above my knee.  But in addition to moving everything around, we changed the network to allow more users and the wireless router works better around the house.  This weekend has been interesting.  If you play video games you might know that the much anticipated release of Counter-Strike 1.6 officially took place on Friday.  The Valve network was so bogged down, many people couldn’t download the CS update from the new system called Steam, but they had to download a 379 MB patch to get it to work.  With that all downloaded, all I can say is that CS 1.6 is weird.  Many people complain of the new combat shields you can buy in the game.  One of my buddies said that people could just buy a shield and a Desert Eagle and wait until the person shooting at them ran out of ammo and just run at them and own up.  I can see how that might suck.  There has also been a few updates in maps.  Overall, I think the jury is still out.  CS 1.6 will be alright, I think though.  As far as everything else goes, this weekend was kind of a bummer.  Usually during the weekend I never leave the house.  I was supposed to go and play out at Kirkwood for a Sunday basketball league, but my appendix (?) was hurting.  So I skipped that.  Instead, I watched TV most of the day and ate a bunch of junk food as soon as the pain went away.  I think I hate junk food now.  Cooler Ranch Doritos can go and burn in hell.  Those things leave the worse taste in my mouth.  If I can remember, I think I will stop eating them.  Maybe them and chips in general.  I was reading in a book how “designer fats” were being created like Olean that have less calories.  One of the side effects of Olean, in some cases, is diarrhea.  With that in mind, I don’t think chips are healthy at all.  Although I still do not want to do my homework, I must end my post.  I have nothing else to say.  Night.

      That's right.  They are boring.  Who wants to even read this boring crapy anyways?  Don't know what to say from there.  I guess I'll just continue as if I don't care!  :D  Well today was pretty boring.  Fire drill or something.  Apparently they don't know how to work the system.  Went outside for maybe 30 seconds and then everyone back inside.  Fun.  It was supposed to be really cold today, and it was in the morning like always, but midday it was warm.  I hope it stays warmer... like I've said.  Winter sucks.  The only upside is the snowmen... but even those get boring.  Shrug..  Chemistry test today... I think I did alright.  Really wasn't too hard.  Only like 2 or 3 questions I didn't know.  I think I got at LEAST a C.  Probably a B.  Ownage.

      Been a long time since I updated.  It's now October.  I can feel it getting colder and I do not like it.  Pretty soon I won't be able to go outside when going from 3rd hour study hall to 4th hour then to lunch!  So that will stink, but I can't say much more about it because there's no changing it!  We still do have winter... Global warming can't be that bad?  I want to quickly mention something before I forget it.  Ever since I last posted my weekend recap, I am proud to say I have not had a single potato chip!  Down with the chips... They are nothing but bad, bad, bad!  I challenge everyone else out there to try cutting one piece of junk food completely out of your diet.  It does a lot.  I have a nice feeling of accomplishment.  Also, I'd like to share a few Googlisms I found on my name.  Obviously "Michael Halbe" turns up nothing... But since Michael is such a popular name on this planet (Jordan, Jackson, Johnson... etc.) I just typed it in and I'd like to share some interesting results (if you don't believe me go  urlLink here !):  michael is one hot papi chulo michael is very sexy michael is missing michael is cool michael is god the father as taught by brigham young michael is the devil michael is not only ugly michael is gonna kick jpm's fat butt on sunday michael is no longer a thriller michael is guilty michael is innocent michael is gonna be ok michael is the devil i'm disliking him more and more michael is the kind of guy some people love to hate michael is leaving las vegas michael is he who is michael is nuts michael is humble michael is hottt  michael is a 17 year old male who has attempted suicide   You guys read the one in bold!  Wow.. no that's not me!  Anyways try that out... if you're bored.  Especially if you have a common name like mine.  I kind of forgot what I was going to post so I'll end here!  Fun.

      I don't really know where to start.  It seems that so often I go into weekends with the intention of doing a lot of good things and getting work done that needs to be done.  I even made a list this time.  Nope, didn't do a dang thing.  I'm just too lazy.  I haven't updated in a while but on Saturday we went down to Des Moines and checked out the red '04 SRT-4 they had.  It sucked because they SAID they had it sold when we got down there.  So by the time we called them and the time it took us to actually get down there, they sold it.  So we couldn't test drive it!  It already had 71 miles on it though.  But, I guess that kind of tells you what kind of demand there is for this thing.  It gets better though.  Just today the guy called us up on the phone and said the people didn't want it!  So we drove down there and under the impression that it was sold and couldn't drive it.  Someone said they would buy it and didn't and I was screwed out of driving this thing.  I guess it doesn't bother me as much as it may seem.  I doubt I'll be getting one of these things soon.  I have to actually get some money and check the grade reports.  Fun stuff... sacrasm.  I've got a lot of homework I don't really want to do right now.  Something just happened that annoyed me.  I think I'm going to make a personal list of annoyances.  It will be fun.  I'll post it when it gets long.

      I think about updating and then I just don't think I have anything good to say so I don't.  It happens all the time.  Today is 10-23 so that means that it is Mole Day.  Celebration of the Chemistry unit we know as a MOLE.  I made a mole t-shirt for extra credit.  I couldn't have made my shirt any more plain.  It feels like the week should be over.  Tuesday felt more like Friday if you ask me.  Today is truly unique day because I don't have anything to do except my homework and open gym which I don't want to go to.  The reason why I don't plan on going is because I am exhausted.  Wednesday was probably the worst lifting/conditioning day ever.  Streched, did dots, lifted weights, did jumped rope for about 5 minutes, 100 sit-ups, 25 supermans, 25 finger-tip push-ups, did bouding on two feet for about 40 yards, then just right, then just left, ran a mile, did about six 30 yard sprints.  EVAN HECKERT YOU BETTER BE DOING A LOT OF STUFF AT ACCELERATION!  I'm not complaining, I'm just tired.  So that was Wednesday.

      Interesting Halloween night.  Got home a bit after 5pm.  Not the best way to start a weekend, but oh well.  My day went fine.  Got some chop sticks in Japanese.  Sometimes I wish I could get up easier.  A lot of the time AFTER class, I wish I were more awake to learn the material.  That is the main problem with school.  I spend most of the time trying to get myself awake to just pass the class.  I'm not sure that more sleep is the answer.  I've tried that.  At this point I don't know.  But I guess the good news is that I'm feeling more inclined to do better in classes.  Recently I did well on a chemistry test that I didn't study for.  That may sound weird as an example but what I did during that test was different than other tests.  I focused on the test.  For the whole test, for once, I had little distractions.  I ended up getting an A- on the test and was very happy with the effort I gave.  Part of the problem with me is that I get in a funked mode of 'I screw up, I can't screw this up.'  This ends up being a distraction beyond my control.  I worry so much about what would happen if I fail.  I worry so much that it scares me.  I loose sleep because of it.  In the simplest of situations, "[I] don't apply [my]self."  Somehow it boiles down to my inability to form a plan for my life, I think.  I go crazy sometimes just thinking of things.  Cause and effect.  What if this and that happened.  That would cause this to happen and that would be result of that happening.  I do it all the time.  Not just before I got to sleep.  In my house, in my room, in my bed, outside, in the school, in the halls, in the classrooms.  It's everywhere and sometimes it just eats me up.  My thoughts boil do to simple things and theories I use to justify my actions.  I trade theories off.  I act out things in my head and see the best result, I think.  The sad part about what I just wrote is that none of it probably makes any sense what-so-ever.  I don't even feel like rereading it right now.  I'm just going to let it go.  But anyways, let's think of something else I can rant about.  Ok.  I cut the side of my left index finger.  Paper cut.  Pretty deep.  It got infected, I saw some pus coming out.  Very annoying when I curl my finger.  Anyways let's talk about something else.  Ah.  My web page is up, sort of.  I got a basic design I think I'm going to run with.  I don't know what the hell I'm going to do next, but we'll see.  If you care to see me finish it soon, let me know.  Otherwise I'll just procrastonate and never get it done.  Cool.  That's enough ranting for one entry.  Damn, I don't even feel like going through a spell check.

      Right.  Uhh... not much to say.  Was sitting in study hall, doing almost nothing... out of nowhere... BAAAAMMM!  Thought it was a gunshot.  No one moved... another BAMMMMM!  It must have been some lunch ladys dropping something... but it was weird.  Nothing really to say.  Umm, how about I leave you a picture.  Everyone posts pictures on their blog.  Why not mine?  Ok here's a picture when we went down to Des Moines to check the SRT-4.    If it doesn't fit on your screen, too bad.  Get a better monitor or up your resolution.  Right click the desktop > Properties > Settings tab > Screen resolution.  Have a nice day.

      Just got back from open gym.  That James Morgan fellow is hard to stop.  Unstoppable.  Wow.  Wait!  He owes me 2 bucks!  Yeah that's right.  Today during lunch I bought him lunch!  He said he'd pay me back at open gym.  Must have forgot.  Today went alright.  But like usual it was slow.  Japanese quiz, Algebra 2 test.  I probably bombed that test.  But I have homework to do.  Fun.

      I'm not sure how many people read the school newspaper, "The Torch" but I read it as often as I can.  I make the point of reading as much of it as I can and I enjoy reading the editorials.  Most of them I disagree with, which makes it fun.  The most recent article by Robyn Abzug I found interesting, to say the very least.  Her article is about, if you didn't see the bold entry topic, how... somehow, we can't be original.  Perhaps I'm getting the wrong message on this thing, but from what I can tell she's talking about superficial things (like clothes and trends) in the school setting.  The whole thing is laughable.  She talks about it like anything different is somehow not different.  It is definitely funny.  Read it.  I might write a letter to the editor for the next edition kicking some ass.

      I had the opportunity to see John Kerry tonight at Kennedy High School.  I got his autograph and shook his hand.     While I didn't agree with much of what he had to say, I enjoyed him coming to Kennedy.  Hopefully we'll get more canadates to come to Kennedy in the future.

      left 3rd hour, he had a cool idea of writing his blogs in third-person.  He figured it would be something neat to change the whole run-of-the-mill'ness of regular blogging.  But as he wrote his latest blog entry, he realized it was late and needed to go to sleep.  A long day was ahead of him.

      Every now and then I question what the hell I'm doing and why I'm doing it.  It annoys me.  I can't control it.  When I get in the negative mode, it's hard to stop.  I question everything and end up waiting until 11 o'clock to do my homework.  I don't know why.  In other news, basketball's about to start.  I have mixed feelings.  End of that topic.  Grading period ends in a week.  I'll do alright, I think.  Eh, not much to say.

      I just got back from Josh Phillips house.  I was over there with the Blindside crew.  They were all playing Counter-Strike and I was just chilling, taking some video for my documentary.  I just thought of the idea today that I'd document what Counter-Strike is all about.  Most people, like parents, don't know much about the game.  I figure it'll show people how constructive it can be.  I don't know if I'll be bias towards one side or another but I'll try to just tell it like I see it.  I don't know how it'll go but we'll see.

      One thing I just realized is that my page is extremely simple compared with most web pages out there.  It makes me wonder if people find it boring.  I plan on taking more pictures in the future.  I've got a lot of work if I want to set up my photos on this page.  Maybe this weekend I should sit down and go through them all and post the ones I like.  I don't have homework this weekend, so there's no problem with that.  Probably Saturday night or Sunday I'll end up working on it.  That should be interesting.  I have no idea how I should categorize my photos.  I wanted to get software to organize them.  I saw a Microsoft product to do just that, but I think it is a hundred bucks.  I'm really paranoid about spending money now.  I'm really dedicated to getting my car.  That brings me to another thought.  SRT-4 sounds funny when you say it, I think.  I think I should come up with a name for my car when I get it.  Call me obsessed but it's like giving birth to a baby.  Sp I need name ideas!  Comment them for me.  Blah blah blah.  Finals tomorrow.  I don't know how that's going to go.  Then I have basketball too.  In the morning and in the afternoon is when I have practice.  I need some sleep.

      I wanted to share something earlier but forgot.  Luckily a song reminded me of what I wanted to share.  Someone said something that made me wonder.  What had happened was someone was in a car accident and we drove by it.   "I hope it's not somebody we know."   The song was "The News" by Jack Johnson.  I felt that comment was sad.  It made me wonder if they even cared about the person if they weren't someone they knew.  I think that shows how we've become desensitized to people's injuries or hurt or pain or their problems in general if we don't know them.  We don't care about anyone but the people we know.  There's no... "Wow what can I do to help that person."  It's... "Do I know that person... Because then I'll help them."  I do it all the time.  And that is bad.  The song goes like this:   Why don't the newscasters cry when they read about people who die?  At least they could be decent enough to put just a tear in their eyes  Mama said  It's just make believe  You cant believe everything you see  So baby close your eyes to the lullabies  On the news tonight   It makes me want to cry.

      We'll I wanted to post before the day was over about thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving and just other nonsense I feel like going on about.  I just got back from  Bad Santa .  Definatly a degranged film.  It's about an old guy (Billy Bob Thorton) who is pretty much a bum.  He has his jobs being santa then he robs the places.  He swears a lot and drinks constantly.  He hooks up with a santa obsessed jewish woman.  This kid comes along and the old guy ends up living with the little kids grandma and him.  Weird movie, but I don't know much else to say about it.  It was alright.  Probably just a low budget comedy.  John Ritter's last film.  R.I.P.  I don't have much else to say.  Practice in the morning, I should go to bed so my sister doesn't scare the crap out of me again.  I forgot she was sleeping on the fold-out couch.  Peace.

      Word.  My Dad just got the Canon SLR 10D in the mail today.  I just shot a few pictures with it... damn.  The thing's off the hizzy.  I'm going to kick his ass though because I want to use it primarily.  He'll try to steal it, but I'll hide it under my pillow so he can't take it.  With that said, I'll probably post my pictures now.  The thing is the best camera I've ever used and I only used it for like 5 pictures.  Wow.  Much love for Canon.  Gatta go to practice though.  Peace in the middle east.

      Yeah, nice to actually get a comment.  Thanks Maria.  I will post pictures in the future.  Right now I'm focusing my free energy on a program called StatKeeper.  I had an old version with a lot of bugs and a few things to work out.  I'm hoping to make it available on Halbe.org for a small fee.  It's just a simple program idea I came up with my Dad during the time I used to play on a couple AAU basketball teams.  Maybe I'll make a few bucks on it... Who knows.  I'm definitely going to do that first... Because I know it'll make money.  Other stuff I've tried with my pictures hasn't made a dime.  If I'm going to be saving up for a car, I shouldn't waste my time on things that are not productive.

      It's been what?.. two days since I got stitches in my lower lip/gums.  At first, having them stitched up made the pain go away but now it seems it's returned.  I'm not sure whether it's because the skin is reattaching, and bumping around causes pain because it's ripping... but that was just my thought.  One fun part about having stitches is that I have my wonderful teammates in basketball trying to make me laugh when they very well know that if I laugh, or smile it'll hurt big time.  Only way I can adjust my face is if I curl my lip into my mouth.  The bulge of my lip stretches out my lip when I smile because it rubs against my teeth.  You know what I mean.  Ahh, but I'll have em out by Saturday night.  Right now the muscle above my heart is jumping around.  Weird feeling.  Feels like I have a second heart.  Just twitching every now and then.  Maybe that means I'm going crazy because my brain's not functioning.  That would be really sad if that was really the case and I'm just laughing about it right now.  On another note, Dad got the battery grip for the 10D.  This means that I won't like the camera as much as before.  I don't like the grip because it makes the camera so much more bulky and professional.  I can't be using that camera in any situation or it'll make me look like a real nerd.  I have hopes that we'll get the Digital Rebel as a backup.  Pretty much the same camera with few differences on the outside.

      I notice a lot of people with links to these web pages in their profiles.  What people don't realize is that you got to these pages and it loads an ActiveX executeable.  What it does is loads a program into your computer that tracks what web pages you go to.  I am not joking.  Let me know if you want to know how to fix it.  I just thought I'd post something about it.

      It's early Sunday morning and I'm surfing the internet doing nothing much.  I thought I would update you all on my interesting life tonight.  There may only be a few people who read this, but I think they're generally interested.  Thanks.  Tonight we won our second game.  Next week we're playing Jefferson.  Should be a good game.  That's all about that.  Lately I've been thinking a lot in what direction I want to go with my little space here on the web as well as the halbe.org domain.  I really have no ideas.  As much as anything, I'd like to make an impact in some shape, way, or form.  It would be great to go with the plain Jane designs I see most people going to out there on the web, but that gets boring.  I really would like to expand on the website into a different direction.  The most significant problem with doing something like that is that my ideas are so simple and yet so complex in so many ways it's hard for me to implement and get going in the little amount of time I have.  It's hard enough for me to make a simple design I can expand on in a few months time.  Updating every page when I change navigation is not something I like to do.  Therefore I create an infrastructure of data files I pull from in each html file.  So when you look at halbe.org, you're looking at 3 files.  index.shtml, data-nav.html, and data-news.html.  Right now I've got something wrong with the news file as I'm trying to incorporate BLOGGER into updating.  I just want to make a simple interface my mom can use with the dang thing without having her tell me if she wants something on halbe.org.  So I have no idea what I want to do now.  It seems like all I do is just get frustrated on the idea of thinking of what to do.  It's an infinite loop of "I don't know"  Often I'm afraid to just do something because I'm afraid of having to do something over later.  I want to set it up right.  With my limited knowledge, that's hard.  Deep breath in, deep breath out.  It's all ok.  I read an interesting quote while I was surfing.  "I seek the truth... It is only persistence in self-delusion and ignorance that does harm." -Marcus Aurelius in Meditations  I really like the quote mostly because it applies greatly to me.  I find myself distracted more times than not when studying or thinking or trying to focus.  My inability to focus and concentrate are part of my ignorance.  In many situations I create self-unintended delusions that make me quite paranoid.  One example was yesterday morning.  The night before coach said practice was at 10:45 AM.  I didn't think about it before so I just assumed that was what was scheduled.  The next morning when I wake up at 9, I check the sheet and it says 10.  I know we have to be ready about 15 to 20 minutes ready before the actual practice starts.  If practice was really at 10, I would have to be leaving around 9:20 or earlier.  This gave me an uneasy feeling.  I doubted my thoughts.  I kept wondering if he actually said 10:45 or 9:45.  After all, I thought, it was around 12 when we got back from Keokuk.  I had to have been tired.  It's just situations like the one described above that show how much this quote applies to me.  I want to do the right thing and investigate and dig out the truth, but my delusions and distractions pull me away all to easy.  What can be done about this?  I don't know.  Deep breath in, deep breath out.  Pray.  Night.

      Sitting on the pot at school (oddly enough), I had a very interesting thought.  When I go to school I have a weird feeling all the time.  It's the sort of feeling that you get when you need something, but don't have access to it.  It's also like the feeling you have when you forgot your book at home in the middle of class.  It's right there, but there's no way for you to get it.  You know exactly where it's at, but you have no way of getting access to it.  I'm talking about the contrast in feeling when you are at school and when you are at home.  School for me, is a very weird feeling compared to time at home.  When I'm at school there's always the constant feeling where I am afraid of something that hasn't happened yet.  No matter what it is.  Maybe it's me spilling something on my shirt, or losing a contact lens.  This is only amplified in critical situations like tests and maybe during basketball.  These are all situations where you must be on top of your game.  Thoughts like this bring me to the conclusion that all my stress is based on superstitions that are caused by very small, fairly unlikely events.  Call me crazy.

      It's been a few days since I had a long entry.  It doesn't bother me it just makes me wonder why I have nothing more that a few things to say.  I think I know why but I'm never sure.  I get in the mode where I don't want to say anything because I'm afraid it doesn't accuratly summarize my thoughts.  So I'll be sitting here, like I am now just thinking and wondering about things.  Do I feel weird?  Well then I think what does weird mean?  Who decides this stuff anyways?  Then if I say I feel weird, you read it and maybe get a completely different idea of what I thought when I said weird.  It's crazy... but this is the sort of thing that keeps me from these long entries.  Weird I know but... I am weird.  In other news, there is no other news.  You get what I mean.  For all of you who were waiting for me to post some pictures... here you go...  I present you... Michael's Photographs (Edit: Link No Longer Works Due To Update!).  Enjoy... I hope.  But yes, this is the new year.  I will be putting up a new design.  It seems like I do this way too much.  I need to go to bed.  Tomorrow is the beginning of school for the new year.  I don't remember my locker combination.  Cool.

      I haven't posted in a few days and I finally got inspired to write something.  I was just reading from the Bible.  I was specifically reading from Matthew where Jesus was teaching from the mountainside.  Reading the Bible, I got inspired to write in this.  I had the pages bookmarked from last Sunday in church.  I was flipping and I found the page because it's lit up in red.  My version of the Bible had red to denote when Jesus speaks.  The entire page is in red.  I had to read it.  So I read most of it.  Tonight I came back to those pages and looked a the bold face type.  My Bible has headings for the parts of his teachings.  There are several topics he teaches about.  For examples... Adultery, Divorce, Oaths, Love for Enemies, Giving to the Needy, Treasures in Heaven, Do Not Worry.  All of these very intersting topics, I though.  As I reread them I began to realize that all of these things Jesus is teaching, the opposite seems to be true of today.    "You have heard that is was said 'Eye for an eye, and tooth for tooth.'  But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person.  If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also." - opposite true today.  People want revenge.  "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven." - opposite true today.  People hate their enemies and wish they were dead.  "Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.  But store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where moth and rust do not destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal.  For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also." - opposite true today.  Material posessions are all the rave... bling bling this and bling bling that.  "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes?  Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?  Who of you by worrying can add a single hour to his life?" - opposite true today.  People are picky about what they eat, and drink.  People are picky about what they wear.  People constantly worry about these things.  "Do not judge, or you too will be judged.  For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you." - opposite true today.  People constently judge each other... just read the newspaper, watch the news, or listen to people talk!  (These quotes were from  urlLink Matthew 5-7 )  These are just a few things I thought were interesting.  It's pretty ironic that of all these teachings, the absolute opposite is true today.  What does that say about our society?  I think it shows we all have lack of God in our life.  Myself included.  I say... I should read this amazing book more.

      I have over 72 MB of IM conversation log files on my computer.  I was just reading some of them and to say the least they're a riot.  It's so crazy because I understand what was going on back then now, and it's funny to see how much I didn't know then as opposed to what I know now.  Wow.  I wish I could change a LOT of what I've done.  But that's not surprising.  Peace, thanks for reading.

      I had practice this afternoon.  It was an alright practice.  Afterwards I got some gas in my car and went home.  I did some homework and played some FreeCell with Whit.  FreeCell isn't exactly multiplayer, but we just played the same game on our computers and she kicked my butt.  I don't have much practice in FreeCell... shrug.  I'm listening to "On the Sunny Side of the Street" right now.  It's a great song.  It's cooler when Dizzy starts to sing at the end.  I don't have anything else to type.  Thanks for reading and good night.

      Today is a sunday.  There were 5 Sundays this month.  That only happens every 28 years.  Interesting fact.  I figured I would post something for all the people who read this or don't read this.  If you somehow have a link to this in your bookmarks, I love you.  Thanks for reading.  E-mail me your blog and I'll read it every day.  I'm currently listening to a title by Beethoven.  It has a long title... "Sonata for Piano No.14 in C Sharp Minor, Op.27, No.2 'Moonlight/Mondschein', Adagio Sostenuto"  I guess I could just call it "Moonlight/Mondschein."  Either way, it's a great song.  I've heard it a couple times, I think I even downloaded it once before.  I took my free song cap and downloaded it on iTunes though, last night.  It makes me want to learn how to play the piano.  That happens a lot, but it's just a very emotional song.  I was just on BibleGateway reading the verse of the day and a part of the verse struck me.  "Woe to me that I dwell in Meshech, that I live among the tents of Kedar! Too long have I lived among those who hate peace. I am a man of peace; but when I speak, they are for war." Psalm 120 5-7  That verse just makes me think.  I'm going to eat some lunch.  Good day.

      I have nothing important to say this evening.  I just figured I would get into the scheme of posting all the time because I enjoy looking at my page when it is updated.  Aside from my self-admiration, this is the update for tonight.  I don’t have much to say tonight but I do want to say I had a good day today.  It was interesting.  It felt good to go home and not have anything to do as far as homework and stuff.  I got it all done in school.  I really like that feeling and hope to keep up in my work so I don’t have to do much homework at home.  I don’t know exactly how all my time disappeared this afternoon and tonight.  I guess a lot of it just disappears because of TV.  I remember Moran telling about how he challenged his other class to go without technology for a week.  I think I might like to do something like that for fun to see how much extra time I have.  But right now I think I’m going to go take a shower and clean my room.  It’s pretty messy from the trip back.  I emptied my backpack all over the floor.  The following is a picture from my recent trip to California.     Night.

      It's been a few weeks I think since I last posted.  I won't make a big fuss about that because it bugs me when people say that all the time as if many people read their pages every day.  I think the opposite so there is no reason to say that stuff.  A lot has happen in the last few weeks.  Over the spring break, the family went out to Monterey, California to see my brother graduate from the Defense Language Institute.  It was pretty awesome to go out there.  He's now on his way to Texas where he'll be doing some training for a few months then to Georgia for something... who knows?  Hopefully he doesn't have to be going to Iraq.  There's a good chance he will have to go there or Afghanistan.  He speaks Farsi and they speak it in many Middle Eastern countries.  It's weird, but I guess he knew that stuff going in.     As you can see the picture is the SRT-4 logo.  I need to sell the Durango and I can buy one of these puppies.  I'm excited... but at the same time I know someone has to buy the Durango first!  Then I have to get myself a JOB!  School started back up today.  Like normal we have lots of homework.  Chemistry was the shocker.  I have 4 packets due in a few weeks.  Also there is a U.S. History paper due Friday.  Additionally there is an Algebra 2 test tomorrow.  I'm not exactly excited about all that stuff but we'll just have to see how it all goes.  I'm pretty excited this term because I think I can do exceptionally well in my academics.  I have the feeling like I can do well.  I really can say that I have the motivation to do well like no other term before.  It's a good feeling.  I will leave you with that.  Thanks for reading.  Night.

      Every single time I begin to read others weblogs, I get inspired to write in my own.  It seems like every time I do I want to seem as intelligent as possible when I write.  I don’t know whether that’s my own insecurity or just the fact that I see how poorly other’s write in their blogs.  You won’t see me say mine is an exception.  I just get so inspired to put something in this empty page.  When I see my page is expired two weeks, I feel out of it.  I would like to go away as much as possible from citing a song that inspires me to write something… anything at all.  I love music but reading lyrics I find… is boring in the blog setting.  You can’t exactly get the correct mood to understand what the blogger is putting this song in their post and for what reason.  Because of this, I will simply explain as outright as possible my feelings and thoughts.  So many blogs are not blogs.  They are online journals disguised as blogs.  Mine is included.  I just want to leave you with one verse.   And He that sat upon the throne said, "Behold, I make all things new." And He said unto me, "Write, for these words are true and faithful."  Rev. 21:5

      It's about time, right?  I always wish life were longer and school didn't have to be so crammed all into weeks and into days and into hours.  I wish school could go on during the hours when I am concious.  It seems like I do fine in school but I just don't remember anything that happpens during school or ever use what I learn in school and apply it to my daily life.  It seems like that never happens... ever.  I need to figure out why this doesn't happen and hopefully change something in my life so that my senior year isn't a complete waste.  I know at least half the stuff I learn will just be forgotten.  I know the things I actually put to use, I will remember for the rest of my life.  That's it...

      I need to buy Google stock because I'm loving the new Blogger.  Xanga has nothing on this.  It's all free too.  No ads.  All you need is a web host.  I really like it. :)  Blogger now has comments supported too.  I love it.  Just illegally downloaded music.  I plan to buy the CDs now that I like the songs.  Is there something wrong with that?  I downloaded other songs, I don't like them... I deleted them.  This is how the record industry should work.  You can listen to the song for 15 minutes before you buy, or something.  Or be able to listen to it twice or something... before you buy.  What else is new?  I don't know.

Cool.  michael.halbe@gmail.com  On to the update:  My sister got married today.  Other than that, it was a pretty mellow day.  I can't say it was all that exciting.  It's nice to have all the family out here, but I don't know exactly why I'm so out of it this week.  I haven't really had a day that I can do nothing.  I need to sleep.

      I have absolutely nothing to say now.  School will be over in 6 weekdays, and I have nothing to be excited about.  As soon as summer starts, I'll be getting a job.  I feel so uninspired to write in this blog right now.  Life has it's ways of just stacking things on you at any given moment, and it makes you feel absolutely terrible.  Things could be much worse, I know but in my mind they already are.  I have a warped way of looking at all things.  I take the worse view of things because most often, I put myself in that situation.  I really don't know why though.  It seems like that's just the way things have been for the last... let's see... 5 years.  More like 8 years though now that I think about it.  No one reads this I know.  I wish I didn't care.

      I'm beginning to dislike having this computer in the semi-basement.  For one, it's cold all the time.  Another reason I don't like it is that it's dark.  It's also moist.  It's also cluttered with cables and cords and extensions and unused electronics.  Old stuff too.  Things from about ten years ago.  Some things even older.  A great number of the more recent stuff is from eBay.  eBay is the king of crap.  There is so much junk available on that website, it's sickening.  For five bucks you can get yourself something twenty years old to your doorstep.  You can do that all for five bucks, plus ten bucks shipping.  I'm getting sick of the same things.  Doing the same things.  Doing the same things.  Doing the same things.  Mowing the lawn every week.  Cleaning every week.  Changing everything every day.  Washing yourself every day.  Doing everything every day because if you don't, bad bacteria is going to get you.  Don't be misled, I'm not saying good hygiene is a bad thing.  I'm simply saying there's been an accumulation of crap people have to do everyday.  Wake up, brush your teeth (and floss and mouth-wash), shower (if that's how you do it), wash your hair, comb it, jell it, cologne, socks, shoes, shirts, pants.  I'm probably missing something.  I do it every day so unconsciously.  Eat something for breakfast.  Make sure it doesn't have any carbs.  If you have carbs, it's the end of the diet.  Atkins is going to kill you.  Read the headline, make sure the world isn't ending, and jump in the car.  Maybe you should go to StarBucks and have a drink that you don't have any idea what the ingredients are.  You still have no idea why you're not losing weight with the diet.  Blah blah blah blah.  Routine routine routine.  Hope nothing goes wrong with the routine.  It happens to me.  I drive in an area I'm not used to and I'm 200% more likely to get in an accident.  Hopefully the spell checker knows how to spell accident.  I keep spelling it accient.  It always makes me wonder how the Chinese use their computers.  Considering they don't have an alphabet, I'm sure it's harder to get up to 70 words a minute.  Maybe they have a different system of typing.  Maybe it's KANJI per minute!  Excellent.  Or maybe everyone who uses a computer in China knows English and they have to know it to use our computers.  I guess they really aren't all our computers.  Half the parts are made in Singapore and Taiwan.  Japan, Korea, and China.  They're just ours... sort of.  Today's the first complete day of summer.  One of only about 80 or less days we get off from school.  School sucks.  It doesn't suck but it's structured enough for me to hate it.  You have to do this stuff, or you're going to be an outcast in society.  It used to be almost no one passed 'high school' but now almost everyone does.  The significance of high school has diminished.  If you don't have college on your resume, you won't get the job you want.  The job that pays the most and the job that you think will get you the happiness everyone tells you that you want.  Why do we have to have ID cards?  Why do we have to have e-mail addresses and cell phone numbers?  We've got these things because we're all needed by each other.  We all depend on each other for certain things.  Often it's a job, which gives you money and gives you food and happiness.  Then it's just random people that we depend on for things like love and other happiness.  The point of it all is never apparent.  Somehow we're supposed to strive for all these things and then the point is supposed to show up.  Now I need to find myself a job and attempt what everyone else is doing.

      Just looking at my blogger profile, I noticed I had something like forty-five thousand words posted in 289 posts.  That's about 155 words per post.  Not bad, but I think I should extend that average.  In about 155 words, you'd probably explain what you did that day and what you found interesting about it.  If that's the only point of my blog, it's stupid.  So that's what I've come to realize.    Seventy-two words later and I'm still going.  Today was the last day of school.  Lots of deep thoughts during the time after taking my finals.  First up, I had a U.S. Humanities graded discussion.  Honestly, I thought it was boring.  Usually the discussions are pretty interesting, but for some reason I don't think anyone had anything original to say.  It was a review of the year, basically.  Then I had a Chemistry final.  The Chemistry final was surprisingly easy.  I ending up getting an 87% without knowing much of what I was being tested on.  I went through the whole thing and used common sense.  Then I had an Algebra 2 final.  I think that was my worst final of them all.  I was partially out of it.  I could tell in the back of my mind I just wanted it to be over.  I just finished it as quick as I could, putting only enough thought in each problem to find a reasonable answer.  Even some of the problems at the end though, I sort of gave up on.  So I am no longer a Junior.  The death of my childhood is taking place.  On a different note, I now have until Tuesday to do whatever I want.  Then I have to begin basketball practices (camp).  I have about 4 days.  I will most likely waste every moment of these 4 days sitting around watching TV or doing things endlessly pointless.  That's what I'm up against.  Three-hundred nineteen words and I sort of still feel like writing something more.  This post is turning to be sort of artistic like.  I don't mean for it to be.  It just seems to be an interesting way to put a spin on it.  Me writing this much is a form of discipline.  I'm forcing myself to write some more.  Whatever more I write is probably pointless, but still I'm thinking.  What it isn't is me web surfing into the dead of night.  It's two-thirty already.  How about I go for the B- and get 600 words?  This post is probably the most unlikely in all so far.  Night after school ends and I'm making myself type more.  Why?  What am I trying to prove?  I don't know.  Simple posts are beginning to bug me.  From now on they'll all be like this.  Long and even more boring.  Before it was 'go to bed, you need to study' but now there's nothing.  Tomorrow there's nothing.  Tomorrow there's nothing.  Tomorrow there's nothing.  Tomorrow is Friday... thank God it's Friday?  No I don't even care it's Friday because Friday doesn't mean anything anymore.  Now that moments are not bound to days and weeks and week ends, Friday doesn't matter.  God doesn't need thanks for Fridays.  Imagine what God thinks when people actually thank him for Friday.  I can think of a couple probably.  'It was bound to happen...'  or 'Friday comes after Thursday, as I remember...'  We wait for these moments and then when they get to now, when they become the moment we're in, we have no response.  Five-eighty-nine and I'm almost done.  It feels like more.  I hope this summer I actually accomplish something.  I can remember summers past when all I wanted to do was sit around and do nothing.  This one isn't an exception but I know doing nothing gets boring real quick.  I'm looking at the Propel bottle next to my monitor and am focusing on the 'Kiwi-Strawberry' label.  Is there actually a flavor Kiwi-Strawberry or could they just not nail Kiwi or Strawberry alone?  Or maybe the demographics suggest more people are likely to buy it because 34% of the population likes Strawberries and 39% likes Kiwi.  Combine that and you've got 73% of everyone!  Genius!  I'm done.  Before Posts Written	 	289 Words Written 		45,026 After Posts Written 		290 Words Written 		45,682   1.7248299725569741081016585133724 word average change.  I made a difference.

      School is almost over.  I'm actually getting excited now.  Last week I wasn't exactly all that thrilled.  I'd say that was because I was in a particurlarly somber mood.  It was probably just the weather.  Planted some flowers in the front yard today.  That was exciting.  There were ants everywhere.  I think I might have gotten bit by one on my right elbow.  It was weird stuff.  I don't like having dirt under my fingernails.  That is annoying.  I need to be getting to bed now.  I have the last full day of my junior year tomorrow.  I'll post a picture now of the car I hope to purchase as soon as I get a job.  Do me a favor and don't buy that one.  They have 4 others you can pick from at the lot.

      He called a little child and had him stand among them.  And he said: "I tell you the truth, unless you change and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.  Therefore, whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. - Matthew 18:2-4  He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him.  He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him.  Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God--  children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband's will, but born of God. - John 1:10-13

      So I tell you this, and insist on it in the Lord, that you must no longer live as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their thinking.  They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them due to the hardening of their hearts.  Having lost all sensitivity, they have given themselves  over to sensuality so as to indulge in every kind of impurity, with continual lust for more. - Ephesians 4:17-19  Wow.  I'm guilty as charged.

      My last two posts were basic rants and my comments on every random subject that flew through my head.  Disregard.  I've been listening to Jazz radio a lot lately on my computer.  The station is called Smooth Jazz.  I think it's helping me a bit, to be honest.  They say that classical music does something to your mind but I think jazz'll do it to you as well.  Things are boring around here with nothing to do and no job.  I'm wondering what I'm going to do tomorrow.  I've got nothing planned.  Basketball stuff'll start on Tuesday.  I was bored today so I went to Wal-mart to see if they had Sega GT Online.  It has something like 30 new cars.  I wasn't able to find a list online.  It's a sham they don't list the cars on the Sega website.  They're probably afraid I won't buy the game if there are cars I don't like or no good ones they added.  I'd buy the game anyways because I liked Sega GT 2002 so much.  From now on, during the summer I'm going to take a lot of pictures.  I'm going to take pictures of just random stuff as well.  Just stuff I do everyday.  It'll be boring, but at least I'll have some proof I actually did stuff during the summer.  It's always a good thing to get actual use out of the costly electronic stuff I bought over the years as well.  I've got nothing more.  Go visit my  urlLink deviantART  page.  I'll post my more artistic pictures there.  Edit: Yesterday, I took apart my Xbox and put it back together.  I took it apart actually 3 times.  The first two times I just took apart the top and hard drive and DVD-ROM.  The third time I took out the motherboard.  I hooked it back up today and it still works. :)

       urlLink Abc... Whatever - The World's Longest Alphabetical Email Address   It's the alphabet twice then the alphabet up to 'k' then dot com.  Excellent if you want to confuse people on your e-mail address.  They'll probably thing it's fake though.  It's free though, so you can't go wrong.

      I found a cool page to look at if you're bored.  It shows popular Google searches and many other things.  It's cool!

      I was just reading some of my older entries in the blog.  It's embarassing, honestly.  I don't even remember half the stuff I posted.  Stuff I posted like a year ago, I have no memory of.  It's great to have this dumb thing to remind me of the stupid stuff I've done.  It's an easy way to recount all the dumb things I've done.  I guess it helps me progress.  Last weekend we went up to Cedar Falls for the UNI tournament thing.  We didn't do so hot.  We went 1-5, I believe.  I don't remember the games well, I never do.  I played alright in a few of them.  Had some good plays.  Messed up a couple times.  Probably more than I can remember.  Wend lifting this morning.  Nothing to do now.  That's my story.  You can read last year this time, I was saying the same thing.  Nothing to do now.

      I really don't have anything to do with these and it doesn't seem like any of my friends want them.  (USED UP!)  Please use only one.

      Well I'm done with that and now I have almost nothing to do I think.  I'll post some pictures of the before and after.  It should be something fun to look at.  I know not many people read this.  Maybe if there were just more fun things to look at then more people would read and watch.    Before    After  Amazing, right?

      I've applied for jobs.  I just might get myself one in a few days.  Then when that day comes, no one will be able to say 'get a job' to me.  I was supposed to have an interview today but that fell through for whatever reasons.  So I'm just sitting here pretty bored, with nothing to do.  After I post this I'm going to go to the bathroom and clean my desk.  One will take 2 minutes.  The other will probably take 10 minutes--if I really do a good job.  That's my plan.  I'm just kind of sitting here wondering what I can do.  There are probably a trillion different things I could do.  Probably more than a trillion.  Theoretically nothing you do is ever the same.  One cell or one atom is different in each.  It's amazing if you take 20 seconds to think about it like I just did.  I like Jazz radio because it keeps my mind stimulated so I don't scratch my eyeballs out while sitting here.  I suggest you listen to it.  I really like some of the upbeat stuff they play lately on SmoothJazz.  I'm going to be an uncle soon, I've discovered.  I shouldn't say discovered because that makes it seem like I didn't know and that someone was hiding it from me.  The truth is that I realize it all now.  Crazy.  Why is it that the internet seems so fast.  Fast, I don't mean in how fast your page loads... but just how everything seems to be to the point.  That could be partially fact or it could be just that I've developed an unchangeable habit of skimming everything I read.  We got a new couch the other day.  It's a very nice couch.  I'm trying to keep the dogs off it.  I don't want dog hair on it.  It is a very nice couch.  I want it to continue to be one of the only places in the house you can sit without getting white and black hair all over your clothing.  (I have a dalmation)  So every time I see Luci on the couch I get mad and yell and get her off.  Then I do my best to get every single hair off.  It's crazy.  Alright I'm actually going to do something now.
