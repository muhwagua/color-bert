      Its a nice weekend in  Riverside  today!  Really great weather, compared to the heatwave earlier this week.  Actually, its kinda cold, and as I type this blog, I look out the window.  I see a world thats quiet and peaceful.  It is serene...yet it is seriously fuckin' unsettlin'.  Somewhere, in another part of the world, there is someone, maybe even millions, dyin' slow, painful, agonizin' deaths, while we sit here in our quiet little suburb and "click-click-clack-click" away at our computers, unaware of it all.  Sorry, I have just been thinkin' about things like life and such;  how things can be so different at times.  You can look at somethin' one day, then look at it the next day and notice no change, no significance, no...nothin'.  But tally weeks, months, and years on that one thing, and it can unrecognizable, or reduced to nothin' but shit.  OK, OK...Anyway,  Josh, Eddie, and Nick  are on, so I'm gonna go talk to them instead of you dumbfucks...Er...wait a minute!  They are some of the only readers of this blog...well yer still dumbfucks!  Just kiddin'!

Changes!   1)  We have a logo picture, we just need to crop and paste it on the blog page!  2)   JR and myself  have taken some pictures for our mood after each blog. We must now put them on the site. Look for that by at least next Tuesday!  That is about it for now! Check either of our  personal blogs  to find out more information!   For the morning shift, this is  Nick  signing off! Stay tuned.

      This is  Nick  again, giving you a short update on the  morning shift ! I am going to walk to school today with  Elyse  because her mom can't give her a ride! That means I will be leaving soon so that she doesn't get to the corner and think that I forgot about her! Ha ha.  Today  JR  is coming over to my house. We are going to take some pictures for this blog, so it will be REALLY cool! Yay! I am going to teach him how to use HTML (the image portion). That should be fun, it will be something to look forward to this afternoon. Yay!  Now, lets get this day started!!!! :)

      *Yawn* This is  Nick  on the evening shift. Actually, I should not be that tired because I took a NAP today! No one cares, anyway, before the book discussion meeting, this kid was throwing shoes from the second floor of the library! Hahaha, it was so fricken hilarious. We all laughed. Yay!

      Thank you  JR  for that INSIGHTFUL post! I have an actually serious post today, (that is just mind boggling, how anything can be serious!)  I was watching  Even Stevens ... yes I know that show is on Disney, but anyway, and it started to get me thinking... The show was about Louis' (main character) transition from being a wise guy/class clown, to a more laid back serious type of person. Now, how can I apply to this to our or just   my  life? Possibly by toning it down a little in the joke department or by trying to take on a more serious outlook or position on life. Who knows? But it just now occurred to me that something MUST change. Whether it is the jokes, or responsibility issues,  I WANT TO CHANGE .  Many people could very well argue that the above is a very weak argument or decision. However, I do not think so. (Hence, I do not think... haha j/k.) At any rate, if you are shocked over the next few days that I tone it down, just remember my main goal.  There is a time to be serious, and there is a time to be funny. Yet, these times can NOT be interchangeable, can they? If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, opinions are in the head of the thinker......  Thank you  JR for the GREAT post about what is to come. Of course we will have a logo, it will just be a little while before I can tinker with the HTML to see  where  the logo will actually go! Any ideas anyone?  Also, we are trying to expand our readership! So, c'mon, start gathering your friends here, we ( JR and I ) would REALLY enjoy it. Thanks for your time and help!  This is  Nick  signing off for now. Stay tuned for more following a few words from our sponsors.

      Today is a fuckin' great day for blogdom!!!  I mean it!  Well, at least for the  Three Eye Witnesses !  After discussin' things with my bud  Nick , we have decided on many plans to improve the impact that our blog has on the world.  The blog will be goin' through some dramatic changes that will enhance your blog-readin' pleasure, and maybe it may increase your dick size and sexual performance (should not be taken by those who have experienced heart attacks, cancer, or are allergic to the exposin' of...stuff.)!  We can't guarantee anythin' though folks!  Anyway here are some changes you can expect:            (1)   A picture says a thousand words!   Makin' their first appearance soon, pictures of  Nick and I  after every blog we post.  Not only will you able to see who we are, but you will also be able to tell what mood we are in!  Yes, we are goin' to take various pictures of our faces in depictin' different moods.  We'll try to make them as G-rated as possible, but please, like the government, don't take our promises seriously!       (2)   Logo-a-go-go!   Yep, we are also goin' to try and create a logo for our  Three Eye Witnesses  blog!  Not only will it add a personalized touch, but also add a sense of originality!  Isn't this great!?       (3)   A brand spankin' new quote every fuckin' week!   Thats right!  A new quote every week.  We will also try and put who created the quote, so that all the praise is attributed to them.   This week's  was: "Nobody's perfect.  I'm nobody, so I'm perfect!"   Thanks a lot to  Josh Davila , who was this week's qoute contributor.  Readers, send in your quotes, it may be your claim to fame!  Well, thats it for now.  Check out the  P.R.E. ,  Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare , and  Step by Step !  We've got shit to say and the balls (well  Elyse  hopefully doesn't have actual  "testicles"  but rather the  "balls"  or  "guts" ) to say it!

      Since  Nick  has been workin' hard on this blog, I think I should put my two cents in too!  Anyway, today, as  Nick  said was very hot.  Actually, it was seriously fuckin' hot!  I mean like...hmm...I guess there isn't really any exact way to descirbe it, but lately our city of  Riverside  has been hit by a sudden heat wave.  Which reminds me...and this is proof of how forgetful I am.  When I get home from school, I usually warm up leftovers or somethin' to eat.  Well, I kinda got occupied with somethin' while heatin' some steak up and I think I mighta nearly burned the house down if I didn't smell anythin'!  It took me a little while to catch on because I thought it was the chicken I threw in the microwave oven or somethin'.  But it wasn't, and luckily I turned of the stove and the steak was savageable and not burned beyond recognition.  Anyway, I'll tell you more about my (our) day sometime later.  But for now...see ya!

      Ok! It is  Nick  here again. No one is really online right at this moment. That is just too bad....  Hehe, we got to play in the sprinklers 6th period! It was really fun,  JR  will have to fill you in on the other information. My heartfelt condolensces to  ELYSE . I heard about the crap that happened to you in 5th period. That is just crap, he should not have done that to you.... Hence,   FEEL BETTER, OK?!?!?!?!?!   Wow, it is indeed a little hot right now. My mom gave in and turned on the air coniditioning for once. Yay! :) Anyway, I will blog a little more when there is more to talk about.  Alright then. See ya later! This is   Nick  signing off! Stay tuned for this hyptonizing commericial from the government!  ***Oops! Fucked up on the bold font... I fixed it now!!******

      Gooooooood morning Vietnam! Ok. So this is not Vietnam. But it is the morning time! This is your host,   Nick  here providing you up to the minute news coverage in the Middle East. Ok, I guess I am not doing that either. Fuck, I'll have to think of something then...  Lets talk about committment. I probably spelled that wrong, but I don't care. Anyway, everywhere I go, I see lack of  COMMITTMENT.  That's right. People are giving up even before they give things a chance. I can probably name a few instances, but I withhold them to myself. Let's just say, some people drop an activity at the slightest change or chance.  Ok, I don't want to be preachy, but give things a frickin' chance! Now, if you do, like let's say, run for 2 years and don't like it afterwards, you can then quit. But, by quitting within the first two weeks, or maybe three, it makes you look like an noncommittal whore. How do I know this? Well, lets say from experience that I was told I was a "noncommittal boy". And lets return from irony, because you can almost guess who was saying it! If you don't know, oh well, you will really have to think for yourself.   That is this morning's lesson of the day. Before blogging I was fixing  JR 's mistakes. Sorry  JR , just had to get somethings straightened away! Like, there was a double posting and a word was incomplete and yadda yadda yadda.  Let's get personal now. Ha ha ha. So, who reads this investigative journal? (Ok, I really wouldn't call it that, but too bad). If you do read, send an email to nickbrown2k2@earthlink.net..... Then we will see who is really reading this. Over the months, we are going to try to gain new and more readers of the blog!!! :)  Ok, let me use one of   JR's  quotes, "Stick a fork in me, I'm done!!!"  This is  Nick Brown  going away for now, but stay tuned after this commercial break!

      Well, I'm back again...and this time I'm armed and dangerous with a new topic!  Actually, it isn't exactly new.  I thought I would just branch off of  Nick's  speech on irony.  I guess that irony can be found everywhere, and is able to take many forms.  For instance, it was ironic how I came up with the idea that, in this blog we should just speak what's on our minds, but in the last blog that I had posted, I had no fuckin' clue what to talk about!!!  Well, yes,  Nick  was right about the irony thing.  Here's somethin' to think about!  Everyone look into their own lives and try to find irony in everyday situations.  I guess that'll give you mindless idiots a reason to use yer fuckin' brains!  Anyway, I noticed somethin'.  I haven't been writing long blogs anymore!  I haven't been discussin' issues on  The Punk Rock Editorial !  What happened?  I dunno!  But I've identified the problem and now I havta come up with some interestin' things to talk about on both  this blog  and the  P.R.E.   I got good reviews from  Nick , who I consider to be my  Blogger Superior .  Thanks a whole bunch  Nick !  I couldn't think of a better of a place to compliment you than our own dual blog!  Anyway, I still haven't come up with a good topic...and so the  graveyard shift  continues!  Stay tuned!

      OK!  Finally!  This is  JR. , takin' over the graveyard shift!  Actually, at the moment, nothin' is really on my mind...or there is somethin' in there, I just haven't conducted a through scan for topics.  I know they're in there, just waitin' to be discussed!  Anyway, when I think about somethin', I'll be sure to blog about it!

      It's Nick again! I am going to take  JR 's advice and I am going to just find random things to talk about! Okie dokey, let's see.............. how about irony?  You may be thinking right now that irony is just what it is......... its ironic! Ha! But, to some people it is trouble for them. For instance, if you do something for a long time (like running) and one day you decided to stop running, that would be fine. Then, people EXPECT you to run, but when you tell them you are NOT, that is ironic! This irony causes trouble because then people try to sway you to do something (like running) even though you do not want to.  Hence, irony is the core of all evil, if I may say so. And I DO say so! Haha. So there you go. Irony. It is troublesome. You must tune out everyone else and forget what is going on. Don't let others try to sway you the other way when you have for sure and ABSOLUTELY-WILL-"NEVER"-CHANGE it.  That is all for now! I will wait until   JR  comes back to blog some more. For now, "Tengo estudiar para espanol." I have to study for Spanish. Oh, I know JR tried to have me type in a blog today........  Oh yeah! Monkey bowling. I will have to expand more on that later! This is Nick signing off, stay tuned for more.

      Good morning everyone! This is your host   Nick Brown  here, manning the morning shift. Thank you   JR  for taking part of the shift for me! Alright, lets get on with this!  This is not much really to blog about this morning. The Malcolm in the Middle season finale was on last night. It was great! Like   JR   said, the Fuhrer (leader) of Nazis Germany was on last night. That man was intruiging. Such a merciless creature, but a complex  and hard to understand person. (Actually, he is easy to understand, he was just a merciless, 'you'll never want to forgive" kind of person.......)  Well! It is school time children! So listen up at school, do your best and do what you have to do to get through the day! This is   Nick  signing off the morning shift, I'll see you in the afternoon!

      This is  JR.  bringin' you, the public, another blog.  This is the second blog of Monday.  It is very early, and if you happened to read the  Punk Rock Editorial  before you read this blog, then you know why I am up so early...Anyway, to business.  It seems that today may be sunny with light clouds, but you can never really tell what the weather will be like in good ol'  Riverside !  Well, i don't think I can make anymore weather forecasts for today because I'm pretty tired out and because I'm not your local meterologist!  Well, I hope  Nick  comes on to take over since it is now the  morning shift , which is not the shift that I work (I only do morning shifts on weekends), and types a follow-up blog to this one.  Sorry for not givin' you a cheery mornin' prediction, but I'm one of those people who really doesn't do mornings very well.  Anyway, I should clock out and start gettin' ready for school.  Signin' out of the  graveyard shift , its  JR. !!!   Nikolas Brown  will be takin' over shortly...stay tuned!

      Yeah, it's about time I take over this blog!  It's  JR.  on the graveyard shift!  I wonder what everyone is up to right now...No one is online, which is pretty off puttin', but I'll continue to blog no matter what.  Last night (referring to Sunday night, since it is now past midnight) I watched a show about Hitler's rise to power.  It was kinda good, and I liked it.  I wonder if anyone watched it.  There I go wonderin' again.  You know, I haven't said any bad words in the past few blogs...thats gotta be a record for me, since I have one of the dirtiest mouths and minds in our little group.   Nick  has now begun the search for a "topic" for the blog, so I have a suggestion.  Why not just speak what is on your mind  Nick ?  You know, whatever is just on yer mind at the moment you happen to decide that you want to type a blog?  Its sounds like a good idea to me.  Not that the whole "life sucks" topic is bad, its just...remember in one of the editions of  The Punk Rock Editorial  how I said that "variety is the spice of life"?  Well by havin' random, unprepared topics on the blog that we could make this blog a lot more..."colorful" they might say...we can still have planned topics, but I kinda like the "expect the unexpected" sorta thing and it show that we live up to our blog's name, the  Three Eye Witnesses . I'll show you what I mean...A witness is someone who sees or experiences a random or spontaneous event (it can be a planned one too but for the sake of it...) and by bein' random and spontaneous, we can make the readers feel as if they are "witnessing" our lives and the things that happen in them with us.  Anyway, thats one of my ideas that I just had to get out there.  You know how I am with free speech and supportin' human rights.  Anyway, you can catch things like that and more at my individual blog,  The Punk Rock Editorial   (punkrockeditorial.blogspot.com) , though don't be surprised if I bring over topics from there to here.  The whole point of this blog, and maybe all blogs, is to express ideas, thoughts, and opinions and the event's that occur in one's life, and share them with the public, or more precisely, people who are willing to read about that shit.  I'm fuckin' runnin' outta things to talk about for now, and I havta do some homework I've been dreadin' for the past fuckin' weekend, so I'm bailin' for now.  See ya...

      Welcome everyone to the   Midnight Shift!  I belive   JR  will take over when I leave, so look out and watch out for that!   So, nothing new right now! I'd like to return to the topic of.......... life sucking. Ok, I will have to pick another topic other than life sucking. Have we defined "sucking" yet? I believe we have....  *yawn* We need topic ideas. Please people, give us some ideas for the blog. At the second, I cannot think of any.

      Ok! It is now night time. This is about the only time where JR and myself will really blog. Even then, I may not blog because it get's really late and bla bla bla.  Lets talk about something new........ Elizabeth won't get a blog! C'mon... get a blog! Ok, I will have to say more about that later...

      This is  Nick  here I am working the afternoon shift. Yes, I do work the morning and the afternoon shifts. I can blog in the morning before school and I can blog after school! Of course since I am a day creature,  JR  will have to pick up where I leave off in the night time.  May I mention that  JR  spelled  El Torito  wrong? Ok, sorry   JR  I just had to mention that little fact there....  It was announced on   The Punk Rock Editorial  that I have a new AIM screen name. That is indeed true! My new SN is  WritingDude87 . Some reasons for the change include:  1) The year is 2003 (Certainly NOT 2000) 2) I am no longer running for my school. 3) Did I mention I am not running for my school anymore?  Well, there you go! There is the "official" word about the change. I will now email everyone the change so that they can change their buddylist's accordingly.  Yep, is there anything to mention right at the moment? Oh, that's what! I forgot to note if anyone knows why the title is called "Three Eye Witnesses"?! It was a very special meaning and if you understand the meaning, it will be very humorous!  This is Nick signing off for now...... Stay tuned!

      I have just posted a new message on my other blog,  The Punk Rock Editorial , so get out there and read it!  I,  JR. , work both the morning and graveyard shifts for this blog, and I prolly will make afternoon blogs as well.  I just wanted to say that, but now I have to go.  I am goin' out to eat with  Eddie and Mrs. J  (his mom) at  El Torrito .  Well, later...

       Nick  here. Yep, I am working the A.M. shift because JR worked the graveyard shift. I tell you, that must be difficult trying to stay awake! Anyway, lets take a current look at the few blogs out there before we get started on our next blog about why life sucks.    JR  updated the  Punk Rock Editorial . He says some true things there! You should all read it!           Elyse's  blog has not changed since last night... so nothing to report there that is new.   My own blog  Needs some updating soon. I think I very well do that. Yes, I know I put some sappy American-song in there. The purpose was not to show the patriotism (ok, maybe a little), but it was to show how FUCKING funny the song is (and how true it is also). That is the update for the A.M. for the blogs.  At  9:02  no one is online on either AIM or MSN. What? Do people actually sleep in around here? No  J.R., Elyse, Elizabeth, or Mario or Eddie . Too bad I guess. I will just have to wait a little longer for someone to come online. Stay tuned....... much much more is to come!

      Yeah, I'm still here.  Workin' the graveyard shift is tiring work.  Right now I'm snackin' on tortillas, chicken, and Spanish rice.  I was watchin' the food rotate in the microwave.  I think I might have been exposed to a small amount of radiation.  Is that whats makin' me tired?  Things are goin' a bit awry on my other blog,  "The Punk Rock Editorial" .  It seems that my previous blogs are in all bold, which i remember I never did.  There was also a spacing error in the most recent blog I posted on there.  Oh well, that shit better clear up and be how I customized it...I tried fixin' the damn thing, but it didn't change.  Is Blogger to blame?  Or maybe my not-worth-a-shit computer is responsible?  Well, I'm gettin' tired.  I dunno whether the food will get me energized or tempt the veil of sleep over my eyes.  Regardless, this is the last blog for the graveyard shift...Everyone is gone now, no one to talk to but myself again.  This is  JR.  signing off...

      This is  JR.    Nick  has now left the building.  I wish he hadn't and I'm goin' to make him rue the minute he decided to bail on me and leave....well not really.  Some people just can't stay up and some can.  Oh well, I don't mind workin' the "graveyard shift" for our blog.  It is a little depressing though, havin' to blog alone, especially since this is a dual blog.  Lets take a quick look at who is online right now.....looks like  Mario, Elyse, and Jeanell  are the only ones on this late.  I wonder what they are all up to.  I wonder if  Nick  has fallen asleep yet.  There's a lot of things I wonder about, but sometimes I never get an answer to the things that I wonder about.  This blog I'm typin' doesn't seem as exciting as the last ones I recently got off the press.  I think I am startin' to get kinda tired...Hmmm no, thats not like me...but I did work all day on a stupid history project.   Elyse  is havin' some sorta drama with  her ex  right now...don't relationships suck?  Hey  Nick , there is a topic related to "suck"...relationships!  Well, aren't you proud of me?!  You know somethin' though,  Nick's  definition of the word  suck  was the bad version of sucking.  There is a good version of sucking that I know of and its really cool.  Yeah, perverted huh?  Well too fuckin' bad, you guys know that I can't go a minute without makin' a dirty joke!  But that version of sucking isn't bad...it is similar to the bad version in the act that somethin' is sucked outta somethin', but lemme tell ya, in the good version it ain't energy!  Well the graveyard shift will continue in a bit...lemme just think of another topic!

         A new addition to the blog family.....its the Three Eye Witnesses!   Yeah, thats right not only is this a blog, its a dual blog.  Now isn't that interestin'?  Not only can you blog to your hearts content, you can now blog alongside your trusted friends and companions!  Isn't that right  Nick ?  For previous readers of our blogs ( Nick's "Go Ahead and Read This If You Dare"  and my  "Punk Rock Editorial" ), you know that, by reading our blogs you are able to catch a glimpse of our lives.  Well now you get the best of both worlds.  Now, not only are you able to follow the important events in our lives, but now you'll be able to see the contrasting ideas, the different points of view, and the life of not one person, but two!  Well enough advertising the "grand opening" of  Nick and I's  dual blog...I must confer with  Nick  about future topics worth bloggin' about!

      Found this off of the web:  "Does your life suck?  When something sucks, it saps your energy and undermines the quality of your life. It leaves you feeling small and not wanting to participate. It sabotages your joy and you walk around feeling crummy"  They sure know a lot about sucking.

      Alright. Doesn't life suck? I just have to say   IT REALLY SUCKS  By the way, since it is PAST midnite, this is the first blog entry of the week! So, JR do you have anything to say about that?  For a while, life is great to you. It does pretty much everything that you want it to do. Then, it screws you over! All of your hard work is just thrown down into the toilet. It's like crap, isn't that why people say "Oh, shit!" they must be referring to their life! Ok, maybe that was really corny (in fact, it was!), but there are some good things about life.     DISCLAIMER  : this blog is merely for comical purposes. That is all.

      Heheh, hey!  I haven't really been updatin' the blog, but who the fuck are you to expect me to do things?!  I didn't really mean that...but this week has been extrememly stressful and its just so damn annoyin' that school had takin' up like fuckin' a lot of my time.  And plus,  Eddie  told me that neither  Nick  nor  I  have been updatin' the blog.  Its nice to know that have some readers and that some of them actually look forward to hearin' what we havta say!  Anyway, I think I'll blog about this week...sigh.  OK, lets re-experience the horrow, shall we?   Monday  had not really turned out so bad.  It was  Memorial Day , and we had a nice little barbeque.  Yeah, my  Lolo  (thats what I used to call my  grandfather ) was a war veteran, but I'm pretty sure we weren't commemoratin' that.  Of course, we didn't mean anythin' disrespectful by doin' that.  We just saw it as an opportunity to have a fuckin' party.  It was really great, with barbeque (tons of it too!), swimmin', karaoke, and just relaxin' with friends and family.   Josh  and  Naoki  came over, and we hung out and did stuff.  There was a really kick ass karaoke machine too.  Everyone loved that damn thing!  Anyway, it was really fun and stuff and so I couldn't help but think,"Wow, it feels so much like summer right now!"  As we all know though, summer wasn't exactly here, as in summer vacation.  Thats when  Tuesday  reared its ugly fuckin' head and I had to drag myself to school and withstand more slave labor.  I was gettin' pretty stressed cuz I hadn't really done much of the work required for the  World Cultures Country Project !  As much as I really think that class is kick ass, I really hated doin' the work.  I had to make a video, find some articles, make a poster, and do some required (but strangely unnecessary) work, and get some ingredients to make a Japanese dish.  Wow, I was practically losin' my fuckin' hair dude!  Anyway, in the rest of my classes, work was still comin' and comin', but most important was (is) the  Author Project !  Also, a group project for  Spanish 2  was sprung on us.  Fuckin' school huh?  Anyway, I went to my sister  Sheelah's  boyfriend's house.  His name is  Mark  by the way.  I had to seperate those two sentences so that there wouldn't be any confusion.  Anyway, there I downloaded some songs for the video portion of the  World Cultures Country Project .  It was fun, but I got a little carried away with downloadin' music.   Kazaa  is pretty addictive sometimes, but yeah.    Wednesday  came.  It was a  minimum day , so that was when I decided to invite  Nick, Eddie, Josh, and Naoki  over to sorta force them (yeah in typical  Fascist  style), to help me with recordin' and makin' the video.  It was really fun, and they started comin' up with pretty cool ideas and stuff.  There was tons of choreography, cheap shots, screw-ups (mostly made by me), and a lot more.  Too bad there wasn't much fact, which was what the fuckin' video was sposta have.  Oh well, had a lot of fun doin' it...yeah...all (however many number of hours) it took to make it.  I later went to the  Asian Market  (yeah  Eddie  its seriously called the  Asian Market ) with  Sheelah  and purchased some  tempura  batter, tempura dipping sauce, and  Aji Nori Furikake  (its some seasonin' stuff that has seaweed and seasame seeds in it...great stuff), and some other stuff.    Its seriously early  Thursday .  I've been workin' fuckin' tirelessy all fuckin' night god dammit!  I don't even wanna think about it much.  It seriously pisses me off!  That mornin', I got my shit all together and made the tempura and stuff.  Yay!  I get to present!  Didn't go too bad, and I was satisfied.  Sounded like the class and  Briski  were too.  Video induced laughin', food induced compliments, chopsticks induced confusion.  The rest of the day...I kept fallin' asleep!  Crap!   Eddie  absent, so I went to his house and tried to help him out with the shit he missed.  I hope I helped.  And now we come to today.   Friday .  You'd think that it would be time for rest and relaxation.  Nah, you got that wrong.  Even if I got that fuckin'  Country Project  done, I still have the  Author's Project  thing to do!  Great, huh?  Well yeah, today  Nick, Eddie, Naoki, Ashvir, and I  attended the  CSF Awards Banquet .   Nick and Naoki  got 2 service awards and  Ashvir and I  were able to scrape up an award too.  There was free food, which I thought was even better than gettin' an award.  I gotta get a new I.D. too.  Sucks, cuz there isn't a lot of days left till the end of the slave/school-year.  Its kinda a waste of a good ten bucks...but I want the damn yearbook.  Also,  The Inkblot  (school's magazine) got its published and printed magazine,  The Inkblot .  Niiiice.  Yeah, thats 'bout it for now.   My 'rents  are singin' on that damn  karaoke machine .  Its fuckin' funny to watch 'em sing and stuff.  There kinda cool.  Maybe I should start  Filipino Idol  and they can try out and get rejected.  Heheh...anyway, I know that it was sorta weird to blog about my life, especially since this is a dual blog, but I didn't really have anythin' to talk about.  Anyway, most of you were involved some way, somehow, so its pretty much about yer life too assholes.  Anyway, this thing is kinda like a journal or somethin'.  If you don't like the personal life in there, don't read it, cuz personal life makes up a portion of what we blog about.  Shit!  Alright, thats enough for now...gotta check up on the  P.R.E.

      Ah!  I think its time for a well needed blog no?  Well, I noticed that I haven't really been bloggin' on the  T.E.W. , so...here it is!  Have you guys noticed anythin' different about this site?  Heheh yeah, you should man, cuz we started puttin out those pics of ourselves.  We still haven't got the pic thing down to a fine point, but  "Operation: Change"  is really still underway.  We have done the logo thing and we've stayed true to our plan for new quotes every week.  So, I would say that  "Operation: Change"  has been makin' extremely good progress!  Anyway, this is just an update blog, though I'm sure  Nick  had already informed you about the change and all.  Anyway, I will blog some more later and try not to forget my obligations to  this blog  and the  P.R.E. !

      Well! This is  Nick  here! I feel like shit and I want to puke, but I don't feel like puking at this exact moment.    New Controversial Topics!   Wow! It is about time to bring in some new topics. As a result of watching   True Life  on MTV and reading  Hanging on to Max , both books about Teenage Pregnancy,  we  thought we would put our own two cents in.  Pregnancy. We all go... "Eww.. you have to fuck to get to that point!" That is very true, which is why I lose some, or a lot, of couples in certain situations. Last time I checked, you both consented to what you did and by abstaining, it would not have occurred at all. But here you are now, you are fucked (literally!). You were caught in a situation and now you can't go back.  Let's move past prevention. It is a lost cause, prevention that is. Our young, innocent, and at time "oversaturated" minds, refuse to listen to any logic! No matter how much information is pounded into our minds, we reject it or passively accept it. Too bad for us! Is it our problem that we don't listen? Of course! If we would actually open our eyes and ears and face reality, we would NOT have these problems. Sadly yet so, we do.

      This is  Nick  on the Morning Shift! I am going to have a quick blog before I head out for the prison, I mean, thing we call "school". I fully agree with  JR  we have plenty of worthy blog-topics, but none of us wants to actually blog about them!  I think it would take a long time to blog about the little incident yesterday and its profound effect upon our little social lives. So, lets just talk about that later, alright?  The   pictures  for the site will be worked on a little this weekend, I know we only have the happy faces so far, I think I will edit the sad ones so that we can begin to use those, ha ha! Other than that, I dont know what else we have to do for our "Operation".   We've kept a new quote each week, implemented some pictures, created a logo for the site and added some cool links. I think that is about it for now. Maybe we should add a hit counter or something to track how many people actually come here. That would be really cool!  Anyway, this is   Nick  signing off of the   Morning Shift .... Stay tuned!

      Whoops!  This is  JR. !  I must've fuckin' double posted for like the thousandth time...of course  Nick  caught the mistake...but I actually spotted the double post and deleted the unnecessary double...Unfortunately,  Nick  must've deleted the original post, prolly mistook it as the double...well I forgot what I posted here...so sadly this will be its sorry replacement.  Oh well!  We'll try to be more careful next time!

      Well, its about time for a very much needed blog, no?  Its been such a long time that there is a lot to mention...unfortunately my memory often fails me...but oh well.  This is  JR.  with the  Graveyard Shift !  Luckily, I don't get paid to do this, so I won't be fired or anythin'.  As  Nick  said, many things are changin'.  Some for the better, and some for the worst.  Life has been seriously fuckin' hectic, which explains the shortage of blogs we are havin'.  The school year is comin' to a close and I'm glad to say that I have completed most of the required projects, although I still have some work to do for Pre-AP English 2.  We will try to update the blog more often as soon as we get more free time to do so!  And yes  Elizabeth , I will watch  Top Secret!  one of these days.  Even though the school year is close to bein' over, we will still be workin' hard on many things, this blog bein' one of them.  Now for current events that have/will be takin' place on this site.  Well, not much has been happenin'.  In fact, I have little to say at this point, and I really don't want to type an overview of today...though it is very much worthy to blog about!   Nick and I  still havta work with the pictures for the site, which we haven't been keepin' up with.  There is really a lack of time to work on the blog though, which has made both the readers, I assume, and the authors quite angry.  Well thats kinda it for now.  Check back for updates.  Give it a week or two....hahah!

      I have to post these cool lyrics!!!!  Instrumental intro to "Venus" >  Sugar, ah honey honey You are my candy girl and you got me wantin' you Honey, ah sugar sugar You are my candy girl and you got me wantin' you  1- 2- 3- 4  This happened once before when I came to your door No reply They said it wasn't you, but I saw you peak through your window  You know, if you break my heart I'll go But I'll be back again 'Cause I told you once before goodbye But I came back again  Asked the girl what she wanted to be She said "Baby, can't you see?" "I want to be famous, the star of the screen" But you can do something in between... Baby, you can drive my car Yes, I'm gonna be a star Baby, you can drive my car And baby I love you  Listen, do you want to know a secret Do you promise not to tell Wo-ah, closer Let me whisper in your ear Say the words you love to hear "I'm in love with you" woo-oo  Try to see it my way Do I have to keep on talkin' till I couldn't go on While you see it your way Run the risk of knowing that our love might soon be gone We can work it out We can work it out  I should have known better with a girl like you That I would love everything that you do And I do, hey-hey-hey  He's a real nowhere man Sitting in his nowhere land  You're gonna lose that girl (Yes, yes you're gonna lose that girl) You're gonna lo-se that, yeah (Yes, yes you're gonna lose that girl) You're gonna lo-se that girl (Yes, yes you're gonna lose that girl)  Ooooo... Ooooo...  The "Stars on 45" keeps on turning in your mind Like "We Can Work it Out"  Remember "Twist and Shout" "You Still Don't Tell Me Why" and  "No Reply"  Ooooo... Ooooo...        Wow, I like that song!!

      This is  Nick  on the Morning Shift! Yep, I would have to agree with  JR . There aren't many blog-worthy topics at this point in time, other than the summer time activities! Of course, after I was done reading the  P.R.E.  it didn't leave me with much time for now! So, this is just a quick message to acknowledge the fact that  Nick  works the  Morning Shift .  So....... how about that weather? Yes, it is really nice outside! It will only be about 76 degrees today which is really nice. I have a  Teen Advisory Council  meeting today at the  Corona Public Library . I'll expand more on my personal blog.. "RTOIYD". Yes, that is a long acronym. Anywhoo: (hahaha) school is going to be hectic today and tomorrow, but most of all TOMORROW. Of course, I will definitely blog tomorrow because of the crazy events taking place.  Ok, I will have to blog this afternoon I guess! Stay tuned!  ------ Nick

      This is  JR.  continuing the  Graveyard Shift !  No one is online, so I guess I'll catch some Z's or somethin'...I'm not really tired, but bein' bored makes me sleepy...so I guess I will bore myself to death.  I finish up  Briski's  homework soon...I just gotta get into my "must do homework" mode...where I actaully want to do homework.  Hmm... Nick  better take over with the  Morning Shift .  It just wouldn't...be...right if...he didn't...do...the...Zzz zzz zzz...Zzz...No, I don't wanna ride the pony...Zzz...zzz...

There is not much goin' on, and since I am really bored...I decided to go online and blog...its just that I don't know what exactly to blog about!  I really should be workin' on  Briski's  homework or studyin' for  the Chemistry Final ...but...well if you know me (but you don't havta), then you know that I am a serious procrastinator...never really did know how to balance my time...Anyway, there is not much to blog about right now...I am startin' to repeat myself...a sure sign of not havin' anythin' to blog about...There!  I did it again...Alright, thats enough...I shall return...stay tuned!

      Like the new site design? You had better! Just kidding. They offered this new template, so I decided to change it! Sorry for not consulting with  JR  first of course, but I thought it was a pretty good idea. Plus it took me a bit just to put all the links and pictures back on the site. Speaking of which...... we do need to add some snazzy things to the site I guess..  The quote for the "unspecified" time period has been replaced with a Harry Potter quote in honor of the new Harry Potter novel which came out this morning!  Until a later time! Stay tuned!

      Hmm...well its apparent that we haven't blogged in awhile...so, I present to you, with much anticipation, the infamous  Graveyard Shift !  Yeah, its  JR. , not  Nick .  Duh, who else stays up this late besides me?  And its only midnight!  I don't really consider that late, but then again, (as everyone always says) the way I perceive time doesn't exactly cater to a  "normal person's"  standards.  Oh well, on with the blog, shall we?   Not much to update about on right now.  The site is goin' threw the usual...thing...whatever that is.  Umm, I guess  Nick  and  I  should work a little more on the pictures and stuff.  Its really been awhile since we actually used those, isn't it?  And we obviously don't update the quote weekly...its more like weekly and give or take two or three days.  Well, we'll try to be more up-to-date and on task with our obligations to the site!  Today I went to  Naoki's  house, joined by  Josh  and  Eddie .  We had a really wicked time playing  Mario Party 4 .  That game is seriously created for multiplayer madness.  Speakin' of great multiplayer VG's, a classic favorite,  Super Smash Bros. Melee  also made its appearance, and as always, it fuckin' owned.  We also watched the  Animatrix , and it was very interestin'.  I mean come on,  anime  and the concept of the  Matrix  combined!  Think of the endless possibilities!  We also dug up  Naoki's   Super Famicom , or known in the  West  as  Super Nintendo , and played some games he had accumulated over his childhood years.  He also made us a great lunch.  Thanks a lot  Naoki !  Oh yeah, and if your goldfish are pregnant, congratulations!  Speakin' of goldfish, I'll try to do some research on goldfish breedin' in captivity.  What can I say?  I really like fish keepin', and its always nice to lend a helpin' hand I guess.  Well, thats pretty much it for now.  I don't think I'll be goin' to bed anytime soon, but yeah...Great, the 'rents are up.  Well, I'll try to bring ya more if I can.  Later!

      "Damn.  We need to blog," is exactly right  Nick , and between you and me,  Nick  is rarely ever incorrect!  Anyway, yeah we need to start bloggin'...and so here I am, bringin' you a fresh new blog...an oasis in a blog-barren desert!  OK, here we go...!  First off,  SCHOOL IS OUT !  Yeah, thats right!  Today was our last day of the school year, therefore concludin' our  sophomore year  and beginnin' our  summer vacation !  That means more time to do what we want!  And one of the things we want to do is blog!  So, that means we have more time to blog!  Today,  Elizabeth , her younger sister  Amanda ,  Elyse ,  Eddie , and  myself  attended  Finding Nemo  at the  Corona 15 .  All I havta say is: what a great movie!  A movie about the adventures of fish and other ocean creatures...how exactly could you fuckin' go wrong with that!?  Well, yeah it was an excellent movie, I even shed a few tears!  Hey, its  Disney , they're kinda good at the tear-jerkers.    Umm...that is kinda it for now!  More blogs are headin' your way!  Oh yeah, be sure to check out the  P.R.E. , as I will be bloggin' about authority today!  Also check out  Go Ahead...Read This Only if You Dare , as  Nick  also updates frequently.    One last message:  Elyse , start workin' on yer fuckin' blog!

      Time to blog! Thats right, its time to blog. I spend more time trying to coax JR into blogging that I rarely get any blogging done here anyway! Well, thats because I dont have much to blog about on the TEW, mostly on my own personal blog...  So, how is the weather people? Where we are it is BLAZZZZZZZZZZZZZING hot! At least it is a dry heat and not this hot and humid heat like in Vietnam (check my PERSONAL blog about that later)...  Yep, I will blog on here in a bit...

I think one of them is a changing quote, I have taken that recently with the  Full Metal Jacket  quote! Enjoy...  Stay tuned!

      Wow! JR is back everyone! Yeah, I know, its been a while since he has blogged on either the TEW or the "Punk Rock Editorial" commonly known as the P.R.E. I, for one, am glad that he is back (I almost typed the word 'black') and ready to write! Let's hear about something controversial JR!  At any rate, even though it may be denied, a lot has happened over the last three days. For myself, I definitely have had a lot of things happening.... You can check my blog to get an idea, but not the full picture if you wish.  Until JR blogs, Stay TUNED!!

The other author  Nick Brown  is currently busy maintaining his personal website and his personal blog as well. He infrequently posts short blog entries on the  T.E.W.  site. He has recently gone public with the company on Blogshares as well and is available for trading.

      Hehe... Wow. This blog has been throughly (I know that I spelled that really bad) neglected!  JR  will have to come online and post his experience at the recent show that he went to.   I've posted on my personal blog, which you can easily access by clicking the link on the left. I have put many lyrics and poems in my own blog, so it is kind of interesting. Also, while I am promoting things, check out my website! I have added a new poetry page (that works so far) and a games page is being developed as soon I get more Flash games, etc.  So, this blog is still being updated, just at really odd intervals. I apologize on the behalf of the Three Eye Witnesses Corporation. We will issue a statement later regarding this problem.   Stay Tuned!

      Just a little update for now, our BlogShares price just tanked due to the fact that I dumped my shares (99% of them) and then issued an extra 1000 or 2000 of the shares. Keep watching the price, it will soon go back up in no time at all.  For now, there is not much to report here at Three Eye Witnesses Corporation. Any further news will be delivered here, as always, in "Real-time".  Stay tuned!  ----Nick Brown

      Thank gosh JR is back! Yay! Now that he is back, he can take his normal shifts back here at  Three Eye Witness Corporation .  I promise to provide in-depth analysis on our stock any time that I can! For instance:   Three Eye Witnesses  Is trading at:    $154   With 0/1998 public shares.  We hope in the next few days the price will drop, but 1000 shares will be issued as a result.  Stay tuned!

      Ahem...I'M BAAAAACK!  Yeah, thats right, its me,  JR. !  Yeah, I know!  Where have I been?  Well, lets just say I'm living and leave it at that.  Man, so what've I missed?  Well, actually, I've been here all the time, but...if you don't know me, well...see...people would prolly describe me as a..."procrastinator"...Heh, I'd say they're flatterin' me...Anyway some people forget their obligations...I'm one of those people!  OK...movin' along...(Sorry  Nick , I know that's your phrase!)  Well, the day I finally get off my lazy ass and blog,  Nick  has to be off on vacation!  Ironic, almost, since he was left with the responsibility of managin' the blog and keepin' it up to date.  Well, whatever, yer efforts aren't gonna go to shit  Nick , cuz I'm back on track!  Well, lets see, whats new...?  Like the  T.E.W.  and  P.R.E. , I'd been neglectin' nearly all of my responsibilities...fuck, to tell you the truth, at some point, I didn't know what the fuck I was doin'...maybe I should save the personal info for the P.R.E., no?  There aren't any real updates anyway, so....fuck it.  There is one thing though...I had noticed that  Nick  likes to put song lyrics up and the  T.E.W.  and his own blog,  Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare .  I thought I'd tell him maybe we should make that a weekly thing...postin' lyrics on the blog every now and then.  Well, I'll consult with him first, he is comin' back today...I think.  Also, I'm sure  Nick  told you all about this  BlogShares  thing and that you could ask him any questions about it...yeah, well thats the way its gonna stay, cuz I dunno a fuckin' thing about  BlogShares , and so I'll just let  Nick  handle it...man, I leave for just a few weeks and when I come back, we've become a fuckin' coperation!  Shit...damn those coperate bastards, damn them to hell!

      Right.  Well, I said I was back, so...maybe I should be a little more active on the blog huh?  OK, well here you go, its me,  J.R. , tryin' to get back on track with the  Evening Shift  (completely different from the  Graveyard Shift  by the way).  I heard that I had like 15 days or somethin' to blog or else  Nick  would...do somethin'.  Heh, I only heard, cuz I haven't been reading or making blogs recently.  OK, if you're expectin' some  "big bad ass comeback"  blog...sorry.  I dunno if this will meet  "big bad ass comeback blog"  status, or your standards...but I'm not here to meet your standards.  Right.  Well, if I'm comin' off as pissed...well you're wrong again.  Because I'm not!  Really!  Haha, even though the written (or typed in this case) word is considered one of the ways we express ourselves, its strange how sometimes written or typed words suck at expressing human emotion.  Just a thought...  Well, yeah I'm back, and hopefully I'll be more obligated to stick to it this time huh?  Well, thas it for now, since I forgot what I was goin' to tell you.  I'll remember...in a bit...

       Writers Return Having Committed a  "Blogging Crime"   Nicolas Brown  Associated BlogPress  On late Friday night, blog writers  JR Ganzon  and  Nicolas Brown  returned to the blog, "Three Eye Witnesses" with a new entry. Both writers returned having committed a crime of not blogging at least two times per week. The return came after weeks of a leave of absence from  JR Ganzon  who was recuperating from a disease called,  schooli-vacationitis  which was curable with plenty of rest and fun activities. Meanwhile,  Mr. Brown  was busy telling the readers that each would both return to write thoughtful and meaningful blog entries soon.   "We were having trouble keeping consistent and fresh blogs," Brown commented via instant message on Friday night, "Everyone at Three Eye Corporation are ecstatic that we can finally keep a fresh and up to date blog." Brown did not comment in depth on why he did not keep the blog fresh in the time that Ganzon was on leave. "I had to maintain my own blog and my personal website," Brown stated.  Meanwhile, when Mr.Ganzon was questioned about his leave he was open and frank, "Actually, I was really kidnapped by the C.I.A.," Ganzon jokes. He goes on to say, "They wanted to try and silence me for exposing the truth." Mr. Ganzon eventually says that everything was indeed just a "funny fabrication" of the truth. When questioned about the future of the blog without him, Ganzon merely stated, "Well, I expect that my partner would have been able to pull through without me, but just the fact that it is a dual blog would kinda make it sorta...weird wouldn't it?" Ganzon said by instant message on Friday night. "And he'd havta pull all that weight like he has been for the past month or so. But I'm back to help out since this blog was built on our friendship in the first place." Hence, Mr. Ganzon is delighted to be back and working with his partner to continue the purpose of a dual blog: to have both opinions.  The blog, "Three Eye Witnesses" was born when Brown had an idea for two point of views to be provided to the general public. Obviously those point of views coming from Brown and Ganzon. On May 17, 2003 the blog was born and is still around to date. Since then, the blog has been listed on the BlogShares market and was trading at B$ 43.34 recently.  --------------------------------   ON THE INTERNET:      Three Eye Witnesses:    http://screwlife.blogspot.com   Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare:    http://home.earthlink.net/~nickbrown2k2/news.html

      Aaaack! If something does not happen soon, this blog is sure to die. I do not want that to happen because there are plenty of Blogholders out there going, "Crap! We will either a) lose money or b) get our shares bought out by the owner!" Do not worry because this will not happen! :)  I will give this blog lets say....... 10-15 days longer. If nothing is really posted by then, action will have to be taken. I.E. the blog will be deemed DORMANT and will stay that way until someone blogs again.....  So for now, STAY TUNED!!

      Yeeeee haw!  Thank you  JR  for posting!! Yay!  As JR explained, I will be gone for the next couple days, so he will be managing the blog for me! It is time for his trustworthiness, responsiblity, and all of that other crap to be "tested." I am positive that  JR  will do an excellent job while I am gone. If something  does  go wrong, I will be sure to punish  JR  (i.e. firing him) when I get back. Just kidding! Like I said, I am confident that he will do a superb job.  Also, thank you  JR  for those wonderful thoughts about me! HAHAHAH.....   Other than that, I have nothing else to say really. Did you hear about the "cascading power outage" all through the North East? and in Canada? Pretty devastating for those people.... No Internet OR T.V.!!  If I do not blog tomorrow,  Stay tuned  and have a wonderful week!!

      Well everybody, its  J.R.  with the  Nearly Noon Shift !  Haha, I just made that up, but it has a nice ring to it doesn't it?  Hey...whats with the surprised look on your faces?  Is it really that surprisin' that I'm up early (accordin' to my standards, its early)?  Or is it shockin' that I'm actually bloggin'?  Haha, well whatever is, just be glad I'm bloggin'!  OK, lets get this show goin'...!  How about that "possible" strike yesterday?  That was pretty interestin'.  You see, if  Nick  ever, ever, ever did that...I would be forced to go right over to his house, take my foot, and shove it as far as I could up his stupid little asshole!   Nick , don't ever threaten me with a strike ever again!  Hah, if its a strike you want, I'd be glad to strike, as in hit, you.  Hahah!  OK, I'm not really that angry about it, but I guess some part of me inside would really kinda be pissed off.  Right.  Lets be glad that the "strike" was avoided, huh?  Heh,  Nick , you demonstrated that this blog could go on even with just one writer...if you wanted to go on strike...well...J/K!  Speakin' of which, since  Nick  is gonna be headin' up north to  Washington , he leaves me in full responsibility of takin' care of the T.E.W.  Heh, only fair, since I was kidnapped by the fuckin' CIA for like how long...I don't even remember...Oh no!  Those fuckers drugged me!  I don't remember...uh...I...WHO AM I?!  Right.  I'm J.R., stupid...anyway, yeah I'm gonna be managin' the blog for the time bein' then.  Lets all hope  Nick's flight  is hijacked by terrorists and ends up crashin' in the ocean or somethin'...What?!   Nick  always says how much he loves the beach!  Hahah, OK man, have a good trip.  Seriously.  Haha, OK, thats kind of it for now.  I'll try to work on the blog.  Last time I heard that the idea of  Operation: Revolution  was catchin' faster than a deadly virus in Asia that came from an undercooked cat.  Right on!  Well, yeah, that means I havta work on both sites then...Busy, busy, busy!

       Strike Narrowly Avoided   Nicolas Brown  Associated BlogPress  On Wednesday at 2:53 p.m., Nick Brown announced that no resignation nor strike would occur. "With my absence for the next 7 days beginning Friday,  JR Ganzon  will be maintaining the blog." He went on to later declare that "no strike or resignation is in the forseeable future."  This is excellent news to all  Three Eye Witnesses  readers, because it will ensure at least that the blog remain around just a little bit longer. The statement came after 53 minutes that  Brown  announced an impending strike or resignation. That strike was avoided today with a short talk with  Three Eye Witnesses Corporation  writer, J.R. Ganzon, about  Brown's  upcoming leave of absence.  A formal statement from  Mr. Brown  is expected around 3:00 p.m. on Wednesday, August 13th on the  Three Eye Witnesses  website.

       Impending Strike at Three Eye Witnesses Corporation   Nicolas Brown  Associated BlogPress  It was announced Wednesday afternoon around 2pm, that one of the companies employees, writer  Nick Brown , was to go on strike. "Due to the lack of blogging by the other members in the blog community in which I belong to, I have no other course of action," Brown commented. He also talked about the fact that  Three Eye Witnesses  has been suffering for some time now, "We've been hurting for quite some time. It's like we are wasting time on a worthless project."  With no solid timeline for a strike to occur, Brown remained hopeful that the blogging problem would be recitified soon. "I am confident that the blogging status of 'dormant' on  TEW  will soon be raised to 'active' within the new 48 hours."  Mr. Brown has been a writer for  Three Eye Witnesses  since May of 2003 while maintaining his personal blog,  Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare . He has been focusing lately on his own blog due to the fact that his joint effort with writer  J.R. Ganzon  has been slowed down quite a bit. "I have been updating my own blog daily, while neglecting the blog that  J.R.  and I have together. There haven't been any 'good' topics to talk about on  Three Eye Witnesses  and that is causing a major problem. Like I keep reiterating, I don't want the blog to just fade into the background, I would like it to stay!"  No timeline was set for either the strike or  Brown's  resignation, yet, he hints that it could very well be soon, "With my upcoming vacation, things could happen faster or slower than you really think. Just check the website for updates every day until noon, Friday."  --------------------- On the 'Web   Three Eye Witnesses:  http://screwlife.blogspot.com   Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare: : http://home.earthlink.net/~nickbrown2k2/news.html

      A joke.....  I was telling my family this joke a while back about a person I happened to not like and somehow fundraising was involved. So I said, "Oh that person is just fat and can't raise their own money if they tried."  The next thing I said was, "I think I could help you fundraise for a good cause. How about I go door-to-door asking if people will give me money for YOUR gastric bypass?"

      Its Nick on the evening shift hoping that  JR  will show up for the Graveyard shift! Hence, it is time for a blog!  Well.... in general, things have been pretty quiet! Ok, so maybe they haven't around here, but I am not about to just say  everything   that has happened in the last couple of weeks (by couple I mean 5-7 weeks, ha ha).   Here at  Three Eye Witnesses  we have some changes upcoming (we will do them this time for sure!): Among those changes include:  1) A weekly quote or thought, etc. Help us out by submitting your own quote today! 2) Our expressions... on the site! This will take some time to get in action, so please be patient. 3) CD and Book Reviews on the site. This is an idea taken from  P.R.E.  (Refer to blog post on Friday, June 06, 2003) 4) A running of index of when lyrics, poems, reviews were posted etc  every week! . It's so its easier for you to find it when you want to!   Thats about it for now! I will now go and start on the changes. :)

      Hi everyone!  That's right, I am back. First off, I would like to thank  J.R. Ganzon  for keeping an exceptionally well blog while I was gone! Without him, well, we would not have the blog that we do today. So, thank you.  As for myself, I've been keeping busy making changes to my website and my other blog. I will be utilizing the "title" feature of Blogger that I just found out how to use! So if there is something that you want to skim over or have already read, you can do so with ease.  Until I think of something that is as creative as  J.R.'s  previous post, you will just have to wait. Ha ha! :)  Stay tuned!

      Hey!  This is  J.R.  with the  Graveyard Shift !  I thought I'd try somethin' new for a change and try to write a blog in poem form...Watch me go!  Welcome to the  Graveyard Shift  I think that it could use a lift So I'll try a brand-new trick, and write this blog in limeric  I don't know, but I forget why I'm on the Internet On normal standards, its pretty late but I'll type this blog at any rate. So your wondering,"What is new, on the  T.E.W. ?" And my reply to you all would be: "There's nothin' new, as you can see!"  Then why did I sign on  AOL ? Easy, see...I'm bored as hell! Porn's the pro, but here's the con: Nobody is fuckin' on! I'm pretty down and pretty blue cuz there's no one on to talk to! But I remember this one fact it's pretty simple, not abstract. Here's the answer, I know I'm right! Normal people sleep at night! But you know, as you can see, I'm not normal!  I'm just me!  Like a flower or a rose this poem must come to a close. But, thank God, it's perfect timing cuz I'm tired of fuckin' rhyming! So, I apologize, my friend but its over, done-the end...

      Ah!  Good ol'  Graveyard Shift , with me,  J.R. , everyone's favorite blog...uh writer?  OK, well this blog has been ignored and abused more than a couple of white trash kids in a trailor park!  So, its up to me to make and stand, take action, stir up the masses, and pave the road for change.  Can I get a witness?    Anyway, what's been happenin'....hmmm...Oh!  Well, here's a sad thought.  Our summer vacation as we know it is slowly dwindling before our very eyes (or eye in my case!)...It's awful isn't it?  Should be considered a crime, honestly.  But yeah, sadly, summer is comin' to a close and we can reminisce and bitch about how our summer isn't long enough.  Hah, the only reason summer didn't seem long was cuz you didn't get off yer lazy ass, get out there, and do somethin'!  Get up and do somethin' dammit!  Don't bitch...stop bitching...stop bitching!  OK, well you get a little sympathy from me...You know, as much as I  LOVE  school, I can't bare to let go of my late nights perusing the Internet for random things...Nights staring up and watchin' the night sky, wakin' up whenever I wanted to...havin' the ability to just sit there and do nothin'...Yeah, I'm gonna miss it, but hey, its  Junior Year  guys!  Don't worry, I'm gonna make sure it kicks fuckin' ass!  Just cuz summer's over doesn't mean life's over!  Hey, ho!  Let's go!  Plus, I can say, for one, that this summer has indeed been eventful and crazy...and I have people who can second that!  Hmm, whats up on the  World Wide Web  right now?  No one seems to be online at all...its kinda disappointing.  I thought at least that I'd get a glimpse of  Elyse  or maybe hear the classic  "door open"  sound when a buddy signs on and see  Josh D's   screen name with an asterisk next to it...but no...heh no one is on, or available...not even my  "pen pals" .  And no,  "pen pals"  does not refer to my friends like  Elyse  and  Josh D , if you catch my drift...If you didn't catch my drift, well...maybe you'll find out sooner or later.  Anyway, I'm outta blog ideas for the minute...**** really takes it outta ya, doesn't it guys?  Well, stay tuned, I might just blog again!

      "If I was..." Contest Is Going on at  Three Eye Witnesses   Nick Brown  Associated BlogPress  On August 29th, the "If I was..." contest at the  Three Eye Witnesses  blog was in full swing. It was announced on Thursday, August 28th that such a contest would be held. Although no contest entries have been received as of yet, the contest is in effect.  Writer  Nick Brown  provided information about the contest and why it is being held. "For one, it will generate a lot of interest for the readers to read something funny and interesting!" Brown commented, "And it will give both, J.R. and myself something to blog about!" This made the contest seem more of a publicity stunt than anything, Brown denies that, "It is not a publicity stunt at all, its just a way to get more interest into the already slow going blog."  The end date for the contest has not been announced yet, but apparently entries are being taken.  ------------------ Related Sites:     urlLink Three Eye Witnesses

      Hello everyone! This is just a short post saying that everything is fine here at  T.E.W.  and that maybe we should post something.... dare I say it........ controversial!  Ok, maybe not controversial, maybe just something that everyone wonders about! It would be interesting, ha ha! We could have a contest, too, for our audience!  For instance, we could say, "E-mail us your completed phrase to, 'If I was....' and it will be blogged about here on the web-log!"  Sound interesting? Ok people, get thinking and start emailing, now!

      A Blog Worthy Poem By:  Nick Brown .  I don't know why I am sitting here, While you are drinking that beer. I am blogging for the public eye, Which most of which think I should die.  If this poem does not make sense, Go shout, and tell your 'rents. Afterall, I must have made the decision, To post this poem that will mess up your vision.  In the end, is it really a blog worthy poem? Or am I just wasting your time that I decided to "Show 'em"? That is the question in hindsight, Because I was not right!

        Rats Saw God   By: Rob Thomas   At the first glance of this novel, you will probably be wondering, "What the hell, rats never saw God!". Yet this title is misleading, because the novel has nothing to do with rats, God, or rats seeing God.  In fact, the story deals with high-school senior  Steve York  who is trying to just finish his senior year in a San Diego high-school so he can obtain a diploma. There is only one problem, Steve is short in the credits department by one year of English that he failed. His counselor  Mr. Demouy  suggests that he write a 100-page story to compensate for those missing credits.  The result is a hilarious, fun-filled story based entirely upon Steve York's experiences with girls, his astronaut father, and life in general. He begins from the "bottom up" so that the reader can understand what is actually going on in the story (if that makes sense, he goes in chronological order).  Reccommended for grades 9 and up,   Rats Saw God   is a well-crafted novel that deals with the many elements of teenage life.   ---- Nick Brown   Rating:   5 eyes  out of  5 eyes.

      Now that I have your attention, I will gladly blog about some crap that you may or may not want to read, ha ha!  Whilst (ok, don't know if that is the proper usage) I was away in Canada, I watched  Canadian Idol . For all of you out there who despise  American Idol  and  American Juniors  this show would make you want to shun television for the rest of your natural born lives. I am not a huge fan of the "Idol" series, although I watch a few episodes here and there, but this was just.... agonizing! The people couldn't really sing at all and they were already down to the final 6! I have to admit, however, that there were some energetic and talented singers in this final group. Yet, that was a very very very small number. What is the moral of me telling you this? Be careful of what you watch on T.V. it may hurt your brain!  Ha ha   On to other important, ok, less important news.....   Operation: Revolution  should be underway shortly. I have to think about what we said (or maybe I said) that would be changing around here.... Oh, I know! A  CD or book review . Immediately following this blog entry I will review the novel,   Rats Saw God   ! Look for it, soon.  For now, thats about it. Stay tuned.

      OK...its another edition of the  "Butt-Crack of Dawn Shift" .  Actually, I don't think we've had one of those before, but there is a first time for everythin' isn't there?    Well, I guess now  Blogger  is allowin' us to title our blog entries...it comes a little short of the title  "Technological Advance of the Century" , but hey...we can put titles on our blogs now!  Whoop-dee-fuckin'-doo!  Anyway, whats goin' on today?  I'm sure most of our readers (yes all  five  or  six  of them!)  are goin' to  registration  today.  Now, you see,  registration  is this thing where students you know, register for school and stuff like that.  I thought I would explain in case someone didn't understand what  registration  is.  Its excitin', but also very off-putting.  You see,  registration  is like a  road sign  on  the highway of summer vacation .  It means... "School year ahead...next exit, a week and some odd days."   Yes, its true, a brand spankin' new school year is approachin'.  I can barely contain my excitement.  Oh, can't you just hear the joy in my voice, the happiness in my laughter?  Ugh...school is startin'....NOOOOOOO!  On to more important subjects...Nothin' seems to be goin' on with the site...not that I know of...I guess you'll just havta wait and see or somethin'...  I guess there is one thing that I guess has valid importance...Did you check out those gas prices lately?  I mean, OK, so I don't have a car...alright, so I can't drive (legally muahahaha!).  But its just another way our 'rents and siblings (if you have any) will havta spend money.  It must suck for them...and for us soon too, since most of us are enterin' the appropriate age for drivin'.  I'll check up on that story, see what caused the gas prices to rise faster than some old dude who overdosed on  Viagra .  Haven't really been watchin' the news lately...been lookin' in the paper for  shows  and the readin' the stories about the  X Games ...Did anybody go?  I wish I did...My sister,  Stacie's , boyfriend  Ryan  went.  The lucky bastard!  Anyway...thats it for now.  I guess I'll go update the  P.R.E.

      Hello! It's me, Nick, to kick-off the contest!   "If I was...."                    ......... going to perform in front of an audience, I would pee my pants, or worse.   So there we go! Now, I will blog about what it would be like if I was going to perform in front of an audience and what I would do....   Entry Number One  If I was going to perform in front of an audience,  I would pee my pants, or worse. In fact, I think I would even vomit on all of the people that are sitting in the front row. Hey! If they want to be that close, then they are going to get what they paid for.  If I was going to perform in front of an audience, I would take the advice of many people who say, "Imagine everyone in their underwear." Then I would scream, run, and reach for my Prozac/Ritalin/other anti-anxiety when my brain takes my imagination and runs wild with it. I would then curse whoever said to imagine people in their underwear and get a bounty hunter to just... strike that person down! Ok, maybe I wouldn't curse them, I'd just...... make up some really bad gossip! Ha ha ha.  If I was going to perform, I think I would pass out right then and there. Why bother with trying to perform when you can pretend that you are not concious!  If I was going to peform in front of an audience, I would run 1000+ miles to either Canada or the middle of nowhere.... aka New Mexico....

      Hey!  It's yet another dose of the  Afternoon Shift , served to you by me,  J.R. !  Duh!  Anyway, I've heard that the  Poem Blog  is gettin' a lot of good reviews.  Yes, thats right!  Thanks a lot to our readers, yeah, all five of you!  Anyway, maybe I should try the doing another poem sometime, hmm?    Well, I haven't been readin' the blog lately, and I haven't gotten a chance to actually make a new post myself.  But it seems that things are goin' just fine around here, so I've got nothin' to complaim about!  Good news for you guys, I'm not gonna bitch!  Oh, I heard about a new contest goin' on here.  I don't fully understand it though, cuz I am fuckin' slow, but its somethin' like sendin' an e-mail with a completed phrase...Well, first off, if its  a contest , shouldn't we offer  a prize ?  I mean, come on, we know the fuckin' people who read this damn blog, its not like everyone in the whole fuckin' world reads this blog or anythin' like that.  And come on, reality check.   Society  doesn't do things without expectin' to get somethin' back in return.  Secondly, since I know  the readers  personally, I know that they're a bunch of lazy asses who prolly won't send in a completed phrase.  We'd be lucky to get an angry e-mail.  Anyway, despite all that, I guess the contest is still runnin', so if you do find a strange urgency to participate, (which would be nice by the way) drop me a line at:  ThEPuNkRoCkKiD13@aol.com .  You can also click on  Nick's  picture to send him an e-mail...I think he made a link or somethin'...  You know, it wouldn't be so bad to here from you guys though.  I mean, yeah, I'll prolly be seein' you guys like every fuckin' day of the week know that school is startin' soon but....god dammit, do it for me!  I really wanna know the hell I can make this the best fuckin' blog on the damn planet...Oops, I forgot the  P.R.E.   Well this can be a close second....J/K!  Anyway, yeah I'd like to know what you guys wanna see on here.   Nick  has launched a bunch of his own projects, like the contest, which I wasn't briefed about (no,  Nick , I'm not mad, I was just merely statin' that I wasn't briefed about it) and  Nick's   newspaper column-like  blogs.  So drop us a line sometime, and tell us what you wanna hear!  I mean, this is a blog for the public, right?  Then we want you to get involved too!  What kinda shitheads would we be if we didn't?  So fuckin' get involved...I know where all you motherfuckers live too...!  Oh yeah, so thats whats goin' on with the blog currently.  The  "Complete-a-Phrase" Contest , and me threatin' the readers to get involved in the blog...oh yeah, it seems  Operation: Revolution  came over here on the  T.E.W.  and has started to go into motion.   Nick  posted a book review recently for  Rats Saw God .  Strange, the title.  I didn't know rats had religious beliefs too...Who knows?  Its a fucked up world isn't it?  Well, I dunno if there is anythin' else to blog about right now.  And I really wanna go and take a shower (heh, wanna join?).  So yeah, I'll blog later...

      "Honking at slower cars and then passing them by while giving them the bird is.....  absolutely road rage! I mean, would you like some guy named Bubba to come stalk to you down and beat you to a bloody pulp? Heck no! I think I would prefer to keep my two front teeth intact, a-thank you.  However, if I was in the middle of nowhere (and I won't mention any states) then I might be willing to flip someone off for fun. I can drive 100 MPH in the middle of nowhere and who is going to pull me over, the cops? Okay, so maybe they will pull me over. But what happens if they run out of ink for their pen so they can write me a ticket. Do I offer him or her a pen?   Ahh..... a moral dillema!

I will still be maintaining some things here at  Three Eye Witnesses Corporations  every now and then.  I am unsure of when I will return, but I hope that I will be back soon.

      Wow! We have not blogged in quite some time. In fact, this is the first entry since last month!  Ok, so maybe September was only two days ago. But still!  JR and I  seriously need to blog! Well, I'll post a little something then...  Our contest (ok, the contest that I thought up of and tried to get going on the site) ended quite some time ago. Hardly anyone submitted anything to us. Perhaps we should have another contest then? ha ha. I know that you are all shaking your heads in disagreement at this point. I just want to get people to come to our site and see what things that  JR and I  have to say!  The main reason we haven't been blogging is due to  school . The big bad school is playing an integral role in our "not-being-able-to-blog" problem. Yet, tomorrow is Friday (which we have off) so maybe  JR  will blog then? Who knows! Its like "How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Roll Pop?"....... the world may never know! ha ha  Ok then! This was just a short update brought to you by....... keyboards! If we didn't have keyboards, then you wouldn't be reading this!  Stay tuned!

      I know understand why there are much less blogs getting updated daily, weekly, or even monthly: people just don't have the time! It was on TechTV that a certain percent of blogs post maybe ONE entry and thats it. Can you believe that? Someone starts a blog and just abandons it later. What a waste of time.  Why do I bring up that subject? Because this blog is like a flower, its slowly withering away from lack of energy and resources. Hence, I propose the  Blog Revitilization Plan . Under this plan, many things will occur:      New Quote Every 14 Days.  Yes, this is something that we need to keep doing... changing the quote! That will help keep the page fresh and up-to-date. As you can tell, I have already updated the quote for this period of time.     Periodic Review of CDs, Books, Movies...  Perhaps reviews are the next thing that we should tackle....? Every now and then, one of us can post the latest movie that we have seen and what not. Or perhaps the latest book that we finished or a CD that we recently purchased.     We Will Become the "Three Eye Witnesses Official News Source"  That's right. You will now read articles pertaining to Three Eye Witnesses, Inc. affairs and what not. Every now and then we will tell you what is planned in the future and little details like that.    With all of these improvements being planned, hopefully this blog will become the place to come and read from daily, or perhaps weekly if need-be. Don't give up on checking for updates! Keep coming back for more...stuff.  Thank you to everyone.... including our loyal readers!  Like  always ..... stay tuned!

       Nick Brown   Associated BlogPress   The proposed changes to the Three Eye Witnesses blog are slowing being implemented, as of 4pm Sunday.   A host of reasons have delayed the debut of many key features of the plan entitled, "Blog Revitilization Plan." Senior writer Nicolas Brown gave an insight on why implenting these features takes so long.  "Well, there are some things that just require a bit of more work, like the periodic reviews," Brown commented via instant messaging, "Whereas things like becoming the official news source are much much much easier to implement."  According to Brown, the  Three Eye Witnesses Corporation  is trying to salvage whatever is left of the "wilting and neglected" blog which was incepted by founders  Nicolas Brown  and  J.R. Ganzon .  "With these new features and what not, we hope that the blog can be saved from becoming dormant again," Brown stated, "however, if things do not improve, the blog will be shut down temporarily, then indefinitely."  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------  On the Internet:   Three Eye Witnesses : http://screwlife.blogspot.com

      Ugh...alright...Its been one long ass period of time since I blogged on here.  But the only reason that I think bloggin' on the  T.E.W.  has almost come to a halt is that there is nothin' out there to talk about!  Or there is, but people just can't or don't want to (or both) take time outta their day to blog!  Of course, if I was actually a person who balances their time well, this statement would have had much more meanin', but unfortunately, I'm not a very punctual sorta person.  I guess I see what the problem is though...so how the hell do we fix it?  I dunno...yet.

       I've got A.D.D...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Hey, god dammit, isn't time for another blog?!  Well, its kinda been a while since I've blogged, and no one is angrier than I am when I take a look at myself and see that I haven't been fuckin' updatin' my own damn blog, or the  Three Eye Witnesses  either!!!  What the hell is up with me anyway?!  I'll tell ya!  Its my fuckin' dumbshit school!  Can't ya feel how much fuckin' school spirit I have?!  Grrr...theres a lotta projects that  us ,  the students , or rather,  the slaves  must complete!  Trust the school to dump all this shit on us at the end of the year, when summer is so damn close, you can just....you can...you...AARRRRGGHHH!!!  I think I can vent for all of us when I say:   "FUCKIN' SCHOOL, FUCKIN' SCHOOL, DRIVE US INTO THE GROUND LIKE SLAVES!!!  OPPRESSION THAT CAN RIVAL THAT OF THE THIRD REICH!!!  YOU FUCKIN' BASTARDS!!!  DIE SHITHEADS, DIE!!!"   More to come...!

       Back again...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Well, I was once again sittin' around doin' nothin' but shit and crap and more shit and more crap, and I got to thinkin'.  Yeah, thats right, thinkin'.  Its somethin' that people around here rarely do.  Or rather, they do think, but what they think about can be considered...idiotic, or useless...minor I guess, on a major to minor scale.  What the fuck is up with that exactly?  Why don't people think?  Is it that they don't want to?  Is it because their minds are so hopelessy mundane that they just can't do it?  Is it because they don't care?  Is it because there is nothin' to really fuckin' be concerned about?  Maybe the public has not been properly informed and they have been given the false impression that there is nothin' really wrong out there, when in fact the world is seriously fucked up.  Well, I dunno why I'm so pissed off about this.  But then again, maybe I do.  I see people out there, driven in their nice cars with seemingly perfect lives and not a care in the world.  Now they are annoyin'.  Like seriously fuckin' annoyin'.  Its like the problems of the world don't bother them.  Even more annoyin' is the people who have all of what the people I mentioned above have and they have the nerve to complain about crap that isn't even worth givin' a shit about.  Their lives are so perfect, yet they bitch and bitch and bitch continuously.  On and on they go...They could fuckin' give the  Energizer Bunny  a run for his money!  I notice the irony how  I  am complainin' at this moment.  But I'm not really done tryin' to prove my point here.  Here we go.  I think that these people should really stop bitchin' about there damn pseudo-problems ( pseudo  means  fake ) and open their fuckin' eyes and seriously realize whats goin' on in the world today and look for the real things that can be considered problems.  There are tons of problems out there right now that society should really give there attention to instead of complainin' about crap.  Right now, I was just thinkin',"Wow, my life sucks..."   But then I began to think about that a little more.  I know that, in reality, life sucks for everyone.  Maybe some more than others.  I just think that people need to open up their eyes, broaden their scope, and try and band together, make these fuckin' problems known to the world and try and improve things!  Alright, I hope that came out with a lot of enthusiasm...Anyway...I'm just tryin' to say,"Hey motherfuckers, wake up, you think we got a fucked up world?  Well lets try and makes things better!"  More to come...!

       Forgettin' obligations...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Whoa, man, its been awhile since I've blogged.  I mean, I did blog a bit  Friday  on the  Three Eye Witnesses , but those were little blogs that were sorta insignificant, that were only meant to inform the public of things to come and whatnot.  Well yeah anyway, lets get down to business.  On  Friday  at school, we had a  Renaissance Pep Rally .  If you don't know what a pep rally is, its somethin' like a...hmm...its the congregation (thats a nice, smart-soundin' word) of the members of our school (students and teachers) to cheer for some useless cause or to show support for one of our school's teams or somethin'.  Well, some pep rallies have themes, and this one's theme was the  Matrix , prolly in lieu of the recent release of the  Matrix: Reloaded .  Not only would hardcore fans consider the sorry emulation of the movie an insult, but it was just a bunch of shit and crap and more crap and a little more shit.  I guess you can at least aplaud their effort, although when you can consider how much of our tax money they spent on paper, lights, art supplies, and glowsticks and glow necklaces...well, there is a ton of stuff they coulda spent that cash on that would have been of use to the students.  That was just one of the stupid things the school did.  Another thing was that they commemorated all of those who got a "4.0 or higher",  Nick, Josh, Naoki, and Elizabeth  among them.  I think that its great that my friends are doin' good in school, but what about the other 1/2 of the students...or (lets face it) 3/4's?  We never have a rally honorin' them.  I know that it can be argued that they haven't worked to earn recognition...but they're human, just like the 4.0 crew and deserve the same things.  Or maybe this proves that these rallies are completely irrelevant.  Not only do they waste your time, but no one really cares at all.  I remember, at one time, I was one of those kids with the 4.0 and how I didn't really care that I was bein' recognized at all.  Yeah, they put your name on the wall with all the other smart kids, but who the fuck bothers readin' the damn thing?  You don't even really get recognized really.  They refer to you as "all the students who worked hard to get these grades", which further degrades the kids who didn't try hard  and  the kids who are bein' honored by reducin' the importance of individualality.  In the recent rally, there was a comparison of the school to the matrix, how it was a sorta of alternate dimension and a prison for those who reside in it and that the students who were "escaping"  or rather "the seniors who happened to get enough credits to graduate and get the hell outta this shithole and move on to yet another long, arduous period of studying, essays, tests, and stress" and how the only reason they were escapin' was that they made there own choices.  How can the school advertise "freedom of choice" when the students, who prolly would have been better off usin' that amount of time the rally took up to learn and improve their skills at somethin', were pretty much forced, in true Nazi opression-like fashion, to attend that waste of time piece of shit!?  What the hell is this crap they're doin' to us?  A form of brainwashin'?  What was the point?  Look at the contradictions!  Well, I dunno if bloggin' about this shit was worthwhile or not, but I hope whowever chooses to read this and try to scrape up whatever knowledge or meaning they can find in it takes it to heart and thinks about it.  For now, I leave you with no more words to say...expect:  More to come...!

       Hoo hah...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Ah!  Finally I have time to blog!  Actually, I shouldn't really be on bloggin' and I certainly don't have the time...but who am I to deny the public the truth!?  Anyway, today was (and still is) a very busy day.  I have tons of shit on my agenda that I just gotta get done!  Lets see...a lot of interestin' things happened today.  First, school.  Here's how the day went for me...It starts with our usual meetin' at the usual place and our usual mornin' talk before we all skip happily to our classes.  Then its first period in  Briski's  class,  World Cultures Honors , which happens to be one of my favorite subjects.  We watched a movie on  blitzkrieg  and other things that happened in  World War II .  Second period was  Algebra II   Mrs. Pizzifred .  She really isn't so bad, but she, like many people, can be A HUGE BITCH!  Anyway, I haven't been payin' attention to lessons this week and have done assignments partially or not at all.  On to break, which was the usual talk about lessons learned, lessons that might be learned...basically a re-cap/prediction of the day's events.  Next is third, with  Mrs. Bartholomew's   Pre-AP English  class.  She isn't such a bad teacher either, but has her moments where I loathe her.  Today we had a  district prompt  that I actually enjoyed!  I even managed to complain about the prompt itself and to discuss about society, authority, and stereotyping.  It was great!  Next was  Krick's Chemsitry  class, which I have with  Eddie, Elizabeth, and Naoki   (Josh H.)  and which I find to be a very interestin' class.  I mean, fuck, chemistry!  Its just fuckin' kick ass and amazin'!  We had a borin' lecture though, but  Naoki and I  had fun sketchin' up  VG parody pictures .  Next was lunch, with the usual talk and a casual game of  Monkey Bowling .  I won both games today, so here's what I've gotta say...HA HA HA HA, I kicked yer fuckin' asses bitches!  Anyway, after that was over, I went off to  Mrs. Schiessel's Spanish 2  class, where I had a semi-difficult test!  Sixth period had to be the fuckin' worst and I havta say that that was not the way I really would have preferred to end my day.  Sixth is  track  with  Coach Jacobsmyer  or  Coach J , the name we so affectionately dubbed him.  Actually, he is nice, but he is still (and these are my exact words) a STUPID, FAT ASS, SLAVE DRIVIN' BITCH!  Even though his post was taken by  Krick  today, we still had to run a track workout...and thats bad enough.  But no, we had to run in the fuckin' hot, scorchin' weather!  Well, I'm gonna try and forget how much of a  Nazi   Coach J  is.  The rest of the day I hung with  Eddie .  We went to  Islands , which I strongly recommend if you like seriously good food at a reasonable and affordable price!  Then we went to the  Corona Public Library  for a  book discussion .  We joined  Nick, Elyse, and Elizabeth  along with  Milano Cookie Lady  ( Kathrin , a library worker with a quite witty and amusin' voice) and discussed a book called  Monster .  After droppin'  Eddie  off,  my sisters  and I went to run a couple of errands.  Which then leads to now, or well now "now" is "then" and well...I havta go and work on my  Author Project Poster  about  George Orwell ...More to come!

Unfortunately, its a repeat, so I've already since this episode.  I don't have much to type about right now!  I guess I'll try to work on the  Three Eye Witnesses !

       Comin' at ya...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Well, this blog is goin' to be the first blog of Tuesday.  Havin' to work on both  The Punk Rock Editorial  and the  Three Eye Witnesses  is stressful, but I refuse to give up!  I havta give the public my opinion!  Of course, they don't havta read it, its their choice right?  Anyway, I haven't any idea what to blog about right now, but I'm sure it'll come to me in a little while.  In the meantime, try checkin' out the  Three Eye Witnesses   (screwlife.blogspot.com) , which is  Nick and I's  dual blog.  Or why not check out  Elyse's   step by step   (ekc86.blogspot.com) ?  For now, I'll just...go...

       Zzz Zzz Zzz.  Wha?...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Yeah, good mornin'.  This is the earliest edition of the Punk Rock Editorial.  Seems strange for me to have woken up so early....oh wait, no...I just stayed up all night!  This ain't my first time though, so I think I'll be able to make it through today.  Hope I don't conk out durin' class or somethin', but that wouldn't be such a bad idea.  Anyway, not much to speak about now since I havta go and get my stuff ready.  You can expect a blog from me this afternoon or later tonight.  Anyway, I'm fuckin' tired, so I can't predict how my day will go today.  I can say that I'm not a mornin' person, where's my coffee...where's my blanket...aww fuck, I'm goin' to bed.  Oh yeah...More to come...!

       Saving the whales and feeding the children...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Yeah folks thats right!  The Punk Rock Editorial!  Once again, I'm online with not much to do.  Actually, I have a lot of things to do, but I really don't feel like doin' them at the moment.  My friends  Nick, Eddie, and Elyse  are online right now and I just want to sit around and talk to them, and that's what I'm gonna do!  Anyway, I just felt like bloggin', but I forgot exactly what I wanted to blog about...hopefully it'll come back to me some time later.  Well thats it for now!  More to come...!

       Like an addictive drug...its another edition of the Punk Rock Editorial!   Well, this is  JR.  again, bringin' you more...things.  Did I tell you about how  Nick and I  have a dual blog called the  Three Eye Witnesses ?  Well, we do, and I thought I should share the great news with you all!  Also,  Nick  has a new AIM!  It's  WritingDude87 , and I personally think that it was about time for a change!  Even if, the name  runningdude2000  was clearly out dated because:      (1)  If you check your household calendar, you will notice that it is the year 2003, not 2000.      (2)  Neither  Nick  or myself are involved in any sort of "running activity", which makes his old AIM very, very invalid!  Anyway, I'm outta words to say right now and can't blog anymore.  Plus I have to create a new blog for the  Three Eye Witnesses .  More to come...!

       Revised and re-editted...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Yet another edition of the newly created Punk Rock Editorial has made it through the press!  Thank you  Nick  for "peer editing" my previous blog and noticing that I had double posted.  Since I am still very new to bloggin' and am known to be prone to make mistakes, I have to keep watch for any more mishaps!  Isn't it ironic that the blog I make a mistake on begins with the "Waging the war on errorism..." and I go and make an error!?  Well, I didn't mean errors of the gramatical kind, but rather the errors committed by our beloved American government.  If you are wonderin' where I got that catchy little phrase "war on errorism", I got it from the newest CD released by  NOFX  called (you guessed it)  "The War On Errorism" .  For the title of my blog, I took the name  "Punk Rock Editorial"  from the weekly e-mail I get from infamous punk label,  Epitaph .  How I trample on copyright laws!  Well, I see it as a tribute toward punk rock by doin' so.  Anyway, I noticed in  Nick's blog  that he sang some sappy patriotic country song...well bein' a punk, I don't have a particular likin' to country music....oh ok I hate the damn shit and it annoys me.  Now I know yer thinkin' I should be a little bit more sensitive to  Nick's  feelings (which I am not tryin' to hurt in anyway at all and he knows it too), but one of the reasons I started to type this blog is that I reserve the right to state my opinion to the public.  Now, I'm not someone who goes around shovin' their opinions in people's faces or insist that my opinion is more correct or valid than theirs and force them to change their points of view.  Even if I hold my opinion higher than anyone else's does not make me automatically right....or any other person for that matter.  An example of the "I-must-force-my-opinion-on-you" type of person is a Mormon.  They're always goin' around on their bikes, dressed in their little suits, goin' door-to-door with their "Book of Mormon" (which should be more appropriately named "firewood") and try to make you a believer or convert you by shovin' their religion in your face.  Now is that offensive or what?  I mean, come on...!  Now, I bet yer wonderin',"What makes you different from Mormons?  Here you are stating your opinions in clear view of the public...?"  That is when I would answer by sayin',"First off, the most apparent difference is that I'm NOT Mormon.  I was baptized Catholic, but have begun to question my faith and the existence of any higher power or deity or whatnot (Oh the side effects of punk rock!).  Secondly, Mormons go door-to-door.  Now the people on the other side of the door have the choice of answering, or not answering.  Some of you idiots open the door.  Some of you don't.  I'm not goin' door-to-door at all.  I'm not goin' in the middle of a crowd and shoutin' this...I am just typin' my opinion, and whoever has the chance to look at it is exposed to my opinion.  Its a choice you make to read this damn punk kid's opinions and ideas.  Lastly, I'm not forcing you to share the same opinion.  That'd be nice to know that there are people out there with similar opinions.  Fuck, I'm pretty sure there are.  But just because you read this does not mean you have to change your opinion to suit my standards.  Throughout this whole fuckin' blog, I have not made one implication to the reader that I would like them to forget all of their opinions, all of their ideas, and all of there thoughts and replace them with mine.  I mean what would the world be like where all people we're all the same?  It would be the shittiest place to live in.  Diversity.  Thats what makes this shithole a great, and at the same time terrible place to live.  Variety is the spice of life they say.  I think thats true."  That is what I would say.  I've been ramblin' on about what I think for awhile, so I think I'll give it a break.  But I just wanna say one thing.  I hope that what I just typed wasn't a waste of 30+ minutes of my life, cuz I'll be fuckin' pissed.  Someday I want to know that people actually are affected by what I think.  But I want their lettin' me influence them to be a choice they make themselves, and not somethin' they felt they were forced to do.  Well, thats my blog for now.  Damn this is gonna be long.  We'll see ya...More to come!

       Waging the war against errorism...its the Punk Rock Editorial!    Yep, thats right folks, yet another edition of the Punk Rock Editorial!  Speaking of editorials, did you hear that my friend and Blog Superior  Nikolas Brown  , and thats how I spell his name (I think he likes it) has been accepted into our school's/prsion's/our personal hell's/our "workplace's" newspaper?  Well, he has and I just that it deserved some mention.  I'm kinda surprised that I am on my third blog today, but i have a lot to talk about!  Of course, this being the weekend and all, I have more time to blog.  The number of new blogs will prolly be reduced to two (2) per day or less...or worse...none!  Hopefully that is not the case though, right?  What else can I talk about in this blog?  Oh, how about I tell you a bit about my weekend?  Well, if you are a reader of  Nick's  blog, then you may already know about our history project on WWI/II.  Well, I'm glad to announce that I got together today with my friends  Eddie, Derek, Robbie, and Eric  today and with everyone's help, finished the video portion of our project!!! In the video, I played various parts such as  Hirohito , Emperor of Japan,  Winston Churchill , Prime Minister of England, a  Japanese citizen , and an  unwilling kid  refusing to be drafted (very punk rock!).  Last night, I went with  my sisters  to a karaoke party held by  my oldest sister's  boyfriend  Mark .  Not only was it fun to sing, but I got a 99 (the machine scores your performance)!!!  Future contestant of American Idol?  No way!!!  Someday, I want to take my friends to Punk Rock Karaoke.  I have yet to go myself.  It won't happen anytime soon, becasue I think you havta be 21 and older to go, so unless I miraculously turn 21 or a fake I.D. mysteriously falls into my hands, I'm gonna just havta wait.  I'm in no rush though, I can just as well sing punk songs for my friends anytime of the day.  Well, I've run outta things to say for now, so I think I will end this blog pretty soon.  Lets see how long I can go without creating another blog...I will just keep on typin' until I run out of things to say...Oh I'm comin' close to runnin' outta things to say....what can I talk about, what can I talk about...I'm burstin' with opinions, but right now I dunno if I can think of one...I know!  Maybe my two "Blog Buds"  Nick and Elyse  have some suggestions.  But anyway I'm now at a loss for words!  More to come...!

       The second blog today...its the Punk Rock Editorial!!!   Yeah, thats right everyone, this is the second time I've blogged today!  Its kinda like, when you get a new VG (video game for those who don't know of the acronyms I've made up over the years) and you play it every miserable hour of yer life and then get yelled at by yer old man for playin' and then continue to play some more.  You just wanna keep playin' and playin', or in this case bloggin' and bloggin', at the beginning.  I hope I never get tired of bloggin' or anythin', and I'm sure  Nick and Elyse  will hear nothin' of that and will prolly do anythin' in their power to prevent me from stoppin'  I should hope so!  Anyway, why did I start bloggin'?  Well, there are a lot of reasons and yes, Nick , Liz, and Elyse (and hopefully the others) are some of the reasons.  Well some of the other reasons are:  to inform the world of the atrocities that happen everyday, to show the world my outlook on life's ups and downs, and the possibility that typin' up my feelings and emotions and sharing them with others might not only benefit other people, but maybe myself as well.  Anyway, what can you expect to get outta this blog...?  I dunno, you can search for some special meaning in all these words, and fuck maybe there is, but basically its just a punk kid typin' up his opinions on this scary place, where Hotchick69 could really be some fat guy waitin' to jump on yer ass and rape you, where porn makes up about 3/4 of all the places you can visit, and insecurities can be erased by way of emotionless and idle conversation called "the IM"...this is the Net; a "cyber-haven" built on a foundation of lies and deceit.  Hmm...how similar to the real world it is.  Only a few people choose to wield the truth and even fewer still have the balls to speak about it.  Well, just somethin' you should think about.  Anyway, I've met my goal of typing more words in this blog than the last I just posted.  More to come...!

Anyway, I think this will make  Nick, Liz, and Elyse  happy, but especially  Nikolas !  He has been tryin' to persuade me to get a "Blog" account and here it is!  I know this isn't an excitin' first blog,  but if you don't like it, fuck you...I can't think of anythin' right now either!  More to come...!

       Top o' th' mornin' ta ye...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Well, I know that we're far from the "morning portion" of today, but fuck you.  Anyway, I haven't blogged for a while on here, so I'm pickin' off the cobwebs that are on the  P.R.E.  and dumpin' them on  Elyse's   blog ,  Step by Step .  Man, that blog hasn't been touched in a long time, sorta like its owner!  Just kiddin'  Elyse .  Anyway, time to blog.  Well, in case you idiots didn't notice, we're fuckin' outta school!  Well, I'm not as excited as I was, say, two days ago, but yeah, summer vacation has been really great so far and I'm makin' sure that it stays that way!  Some more good news is...I got my  yellow card  from  RCC .  It was really ironic, cuz I got it on  Tuesday , the day that I got off of school.  Hmm, a letter of approval to begin attendin' another school when you just got off school.  Anyway,  I'm still awaitin'  Nick's  answer on whether we should go or not.  I really hope we do go, but it is his decision.  Still, I hope he says what I wanna hear!  OK...projects that are bein' worked on.  Let's see...plans on  Operation: Revolution  are still bein' worked on.  I just gotta figure out how I'm gonna do all that crap and still continue to talk about contraversial stuff.  I think I can do it, and its worth a try I guess.  Next up is  The Big Black Book of Baffling Bullshit .  I haven't started workin' on that much, but I will soon I guess.  There are just so many jokes, I dunno how I'm gonna remember 'em all!  I'll try guys!  Well, thats about it for now.  No one is online, so there isn't anybody to fuckin' talk to...shit.  Well, I'm just gonna go blog for the  T.E.W.  then.  I'll try to blog about authority sometime...when I feel like it.  More to come...!

       Bafflin' bullshit...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Well, yeah.  Just another afternoon spent bloggin'.  Hmm, what are the current topics I can blog about?  I'm not really sure, and since you can't give me an answer...well you're no help at all!  Well, I guess I'll just make a few announcements then.    First off, the school year is almost over!  Yeaaah!  Yeaaah!  Wow, the countdown is at five (5) business days left (there is actually seven days left if you count Saturday and Sunday).  And the countdown continues...  Secondly, I still haven't received my  yellow card  from  RCC !  I'm gettin' a little worried...Gettin' rejected for summer school!?  How sorry would that be!?  Hopefully I won't be, and I know  Nick  is countin' on me...I won't let ya down buddy!  Next, the plans for  Operation: Revolution  are still bein' finalized.  I have decided to give it a whack!  Heh, I have fuckin' nothin' to lose and everythin' to gain...Sorry, I just thought that sounded cool...Anyway, I just thought that it would be cool to try it on, and if it doesn't work, then off to the pit!    Finally, with the school year comin' to an end,  Naoki  has reminded me over and over again of how many jokes that we've all come up with and how we should compile them into a book so that they can bask in everlasting glory and never be forgotten!  So, I decided to try and rack my brains in order to put together all those dumbfuck jokes we've made.  The book will be entitled  The Big Black Book of Baffling Bullshit !  I came up with that!  Interestin' name huh?  All thanks to  Naoki  for suggestin' the idea to make the book (though we've said that we had to do it before in the years past).  I will try to work on that, but I kinda need yer guys' help in puttin' it all together!  They're your jokes as much as mine!  Well, thats it for now...More to come...!

       Book off...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Hey!  It's yet another edition of  The Punk Rock Editorial !  As you may know (if you check the  T.E.W.  and look at the posting times), there is nothin' to really blog about right now.  I guess I can bore you with my weekend, hmm?    Well, the highlight of this weekend was today, Sunday.  I went to  Book Off  with  Naoki , his older brother  Joe , and their Romanian friend  David .  That store  Book Off  is really somethin'!  I must've gotten lost since I had no idea what to look for or how to read some of the signs.  Lucky that  Naoki  was there, huh!?  Well,  Book Off  is a  Japanese book  (Duh!)  store , where they sell comics, books, videos, and DVD's alike!  It was really great, since  Naoki  was able to swipe a  Kirby manga  and I spotted a couple of CD's from bands I recognized ( Bad Religion, NOFX, The Sex Pistols ) and some I didn't!   Naoki  pointed out the various  Pokmon  soundtracks.  We also had a fruitless search for  "Suupa Mario-kun"  (literally  Mr. Super Mario ).  Its too bad that we had no luck finding a  Mario manga .  Better luck next time huh?  Oh yeah, there was this guy at the checkout counter that had to say somethin' whenever somebody came into the store...poor guy had to say it over and over again!   Next, we headed on over to the  Marukai Market , where  Naoki  had to pick up a few necessities...No big there I guess, except for the various products that had  Engrish  on them.  Some were  Flavono  chewing gum,  Calpis  drink (cow piss?),  Nudy Clean  shower gel,  No Time  chewing gum, and (my personal favorite)  Elis  ( Elyse!? )  Maxi Pads .  Well, that was that...and they dropped my off at my house.  Then I had to go run some errands.  First, I headed out to the  Corona Public Library  to renew some books and check out some new ones.  I renewed  1984  and  Keep the Aspidistra Flying  by  George Orwell  and picked up  Down and Out in Paris and London  (also by  Orwell ) and  China and Japan: Myths and Legends  by  Donald A. MacKenzie .  Maybe some book reviews are in order?  Well,  Operation: Revolution  has yet to go underway (I still haven't decided to do it or not) so just stay tuned ok?  I then headed to  Petsmart  to pick up fish supplies.  On weekends they have dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens up for adoption.  One day I wanna adopt one of those fuckers...they're just so damn cute!  Anyway, I managed to pick up some variety fish tablets and a little container of bloodworms...my  clown loaches  will absolutely love those!    Skip a few hours forward and here we are!  Well, thats it for now.  Sorry if this blog wasn't exactly excitin', but oh well...this blog serves many purposes, and being a journal is one of them!  Hey, I didn't really cuss a lot in this one...ok...shit, fuck, whore, slut, fucker, motherfucker, son of a bitch, cocksuckin', saggy tits, nasty nipple, pillow bitin', pussy licker, dick sucker, cum guzzlin', jizm squirt!  I made it up to you!  More to come...!

       Runnin' outta slogans...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Hey folks, back again to type yet another interestin' blog...maybe.  Actaully, I was thinkin' about the  Three Eye Witnesses  and how  Nick and I  have been strugglin' to make renovations and whatnot on it.  I also thought of  Eddie , who made a few suggestions on how to make the  P.R.E.  better.  So I decided to start thinkin' up ideas on how to improve the site and make it really kick ass.  I have some ideas, which I will present to you now.  I have proudly entitled this site renovation project  "Operation:  Revolution"   (1)   Meetin' the status quo...te!   Yeah, I definitely got this idea from the  T.E.W. .  If yer not familiar with it though....well, its somethin' like a brand new fuckin' quote every week, or somethin'.  It would be pretty cool huh?  Of course, I'm not gonna get rid of the  "site slogan" , as I like to call it, which is:   "Before you criticize someone, walk a mile in their shoes...that way, when you criticize them, yer a mile away and you have their shoes!" .  Anyway, here's how it works...quotes will be searched for in various places.  I find one I like, I put it at the top of the site, along with the person who said the damn thing.  Yeah, readers' quotes are welcome...so send 'em in.  (2)   Just for you, a book review!   Yeah, thats right.  I read books.  Wicked, eh?  No doubt inspired by  Nick and Eddie , and even more surprisingly, the recent  Author's Project , I decided that I wanna try and expose the world to interestin' literature.  Here's what to expect.  It'll be sorta like an overview of the book, what its about, who its written by, the title...you know.  I will still havta work on this idea though, so yeah...  (3)   Sounds like... This is an idea presented by  Eddie .  Similar to the book review, this will be a CD review on any recent CD's that happen to fall into my possession (I won't say how...)  Be warned though, I only listen to punk, hardcore, and ska...and some 80's too, so yeah...those will be the genres of music that I'll be reviewin' and whatnot.  Also, info on the band's tour dates (maybe)...I guess we'll just havta wait and see.  Well, those are the main ideas I guess.  Of course, I won't stray from bringin' up contoversial topics and stuff.  I have been browsin' online and lookin' through the local paper in search for blog-worthy topics.  I dunno if or when these changes will come in effect though.  Of course, suggestions are welcome from everyone (thats you guys), so yeah.  I want this to be for the people, by the people...course it'll be typed by me...so I get all the credit!  Just kiddin'!  Anyway keep readin'!  More to come...!

       Throw me a freakin' blog here...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Finally!  Fuckin' haven't had time to blog at all!  Yeah, contribute all hatred toward the school and their fucked up system!  Anyway, much has happened since the last time I blogged (I dunno when I last blogged)!  I know the readers, or should I say "the privelaged few" have been expectin' me to spew out more of my aspects on life and the things mashed into it.  I haven't got anythin' to say at this moment, really.  Actually, I am warmin' up some food to eat, and would rather eat than blog at the moment.  I might be up for awhile so maybe I will blog again.  I have some ideas to present to you, the public, and therefore will make the effort to try to blog later.  I also havta cover the  Graveyard Shift  for  Nick and I's   Three Eye Witnesses !  Anyway, I'll see ya later.  More to come...!

       Up, down, zigzag, spin, loop, turn...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Wow, I seriously haven't updated this blog in a very, very long time, huh?  Well, thanks to readers like  Eddie , who have dutifully informed me to fuckin' update the blog, I will do so now in a very fashionable manner.  I'm sure a lot a lot a lot (yeah, I repeated the word "a lot" on purpose  Nick ) have heard people or even heard yerself use the phrase "Life is like a rollercoaster, it has its ups and downs."  Damn right its like a rollercoaster.  Now, lets see...there are different kinds of blogs that will appear on the  Punk Rock Editorial , such as the conspiracy blog, the victory blog, the information blog...all of them are written for different purposes.  Well this is a fuckin' angry blog, or in other words, you have the fuckin' privelage to listen to me go postal and whatnot.  Well, things aren't so bad right now...or at least they're an improvement from what they were yesterday.   My old man  is seriously being' a motherfucker right now, and it just pisses me the fuck off.  God damn dude, he quit his fuckin' job today!  And he always fuckin' does that!  Alright, everyone is entitled to a good bitch, which is one of the reasons I started this damn blog...to fuckin' bitch and rant and rave and bitch...I guess its sorta like a kinda personal journal or somethin'.  It really helps to get yer feelings out there.  Anyway, I think thats enough for now...this blog prolly accomplished nothin'...or maybe its an allusion to the next blog topic?  More to come...!

       Back to the known...Its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Well, we sorta experienced a long dry spell there now, didn't we?  Heh, OK, I'm glad to say I'm back and ready to blog...sorta!  Now, in the wise words of  Nick , lets move on, shall we?  Right, well, I sorta consider myself a cross between an optimistic and pessimistic person, so I guess it would be very opti-pessimistic of me to say that my life has been suckin', but that things will pick up.  Well, whatever you wanna call that statement, thats the way it was, always has been, and always will be.  Life sucks.  Its a known fact, isn't it?  I mean, scientifically proven and everythin'?  Haha, maybe not, and I don't know if my life will always suck...hell, I'm just a confused kid.  Dunno what to think sometimes, you know?  In risk of contradictin' my statement of "it always will be," I don't believe in destiny...I don't think some awesome power controls your fate...unless you consider yourself an awesome power.  What I mean is, its the paths that you choose that really determine where you go.  Pretty much, its all up to you.  Anyway, I'm gettin' all philosophical, and I want to stop.  Lots has been up, but since my sister is tellin' me to go and get ready for a family party, I guess I'll just leave that for a later bloggin' topic.  Just be fuckin' glad I was nice enough to throw you all a fuckin' bone OK?  More to come...!

       Skeet skeet muh'fucka...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Heh, I thought it would be a good idea to blog on here cuz I haven't posted in awhile.  Not much goin' on here, as if that wasn't obvious.  I'm just kickin' back, but shriveling inside knowin' that school is back in session soon and that vacation is soon goin' to be over...Silent moment for a minute...its just so....so....its unbearable almost...hold on...OK OK, I'm over it, life moves on, blah blah blah...  School is startin' soon (Thank you,  Captain Obvious !)  Fuck, I need a new topic...how many fuckin' times can I remind you guys that school is startin'?  As if you guys didn't fuckin' know already huh?  Anyway, its gonna be a kick ass year...its only gonna suck of you let it suck...oh slightly sexual!  Anyway,  Operation: Revolution  still really hasn't started...Damn, why do I keep statin' the obvious...Well it hasn't started, but its takin' its toll over on the  T.E.W.   I'll blog more on this later...when somethin' acutally develops in this category...  I have nothin' to blog about...I really need to bail!  Sorry guys....this is the worst blog ever!

       Thats youth...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Hey!  Another blog from the creator of the  P.R.E. , ME!  Haha, yeah I'm up pretty damn early aren't I?  Strange if ya know me, strange even if you don't!  Well *yawn* good mornin' to all you skanky bitches anyway!  Whats up?  Prolly not you guys, cuz its too damn early to be awake!  Dunno why I'm up, but I caught my forty winks and shit, and I'm up, you know, and ready to go!  Hey, that rhymes!  Duh, dumbshits!  Right, gotta make a correction.  I guess  Blogger  lets you choose if you wanna put a title on every blog you post or not.  I thought it was just somethin' they decided to add to every blog, but I guess not.   Nick  musta enabled it on the  T.E.W. , cuz I sure as hell didn't!  I also read the previous posts after I made a new blog this mornin' for the T.E.W. and I remember vaguely (...Shit, already!?  Damn, I've got a bad memory!)  Nick  mentionin' some shit about titles.  Oh yeah,  Nick , your welcome for the nice little comments about me.  'Preciate it.  Haha, yeah, I guess I'll give you my thanks later...or never...whichever  happens you know?  Anyway, I got a brand new story to tell about the horrors of society!  I would like to call it  "The 'Authority' of Rent-A-Cops" .  Rememeber kids, I used the word "authority" looser than a $2 crack whore, and thats sayin' somethin'!  See, once upon a Saturday night, me and my sisters,  Chu-chi  and  Stacie , and  Stacie's  boyfriend,  Ryan , headed out to the city of  Orange  to hang out at the  Block .  For those of you who aren't familiar with  the O.C.  (haha that show is so retarded), the  Block  is a big outdoor mall thing.  Pretty fuckin' awesome too.  Anyway, its kinda late, around ten or eleven, you know.   Ryan  and  me  happen to be minors, and these fuckin'  Rent-A-Cops  come up to us and ask us what we're up to.  I was thinkin',"What the fuck?"  They proceed to ask us if we're 18, and well we said "No" not really thinkin' that theres a problem with bein' under 18.   Chu-chi , who is like 22 years old, comes up and says "They're with me."  I guess it makes it perfectly legal that we were out then, since we were under the supervision of someone 21 and over.  So we just went off on are merry little way, passin' kids up that are our age (17, 16, and even younger!).  Anyway, you should know, that there are tons of kids our age (or well young people if you are older and happen to stumble on this) walkin' around and there are tons of places they would hit too, like the  Vans Store , complete with skatepark, the  No Fear Store , personal fav of mine...and then a  Gameworks-type  place.  You know, an arcade and shit...Anyway, we happened to go to the arcade...and lemme tell ya, there were fuckin' kids like way younger than us, prolly with their parents, but still the ones runnin' around the place...well...I doubt Daddy and Mommy could keep up with them.  But yeah, they were there, teenagers were there, everyone was fuckin' there.  Not a bad choice of games either!  Anyway...we have are little fun and games then head out, cuz we are goin' home.  As we're walkin' toward one of the many entrance/exits of the  Block , we see the  Rent-A-Cops   patrollin' the place likes its a fuckin' ghetto.  They spot us and say "You havta leave," and since we're on our way, we just keep goin'.  Then one of 'em asks me,"Didn't we talk to you before?"  I was like, "Yeah," and kept walkin'.  But  Stacie , who is very confrontational, proceeds to get in an argument with the group of grown-up, big bad  Rent-A-Cops ...Fuck, she has more balls then I do!  Anyway, she's complainin' that they are harassin' us...which is damn true!  Cuz there were tons of dudes and chicks walkin' around that were our age!  Anyway, some dude from a bar yells,"Throw 'em in juvie, throw 'em in juvie!"  That fucker pissed me off...sayin' that to my sister, and plus she's 18, perfectly legal to be out!  I wanted to yell somethin' back, but I find it better if I keep my fuckin' mouth shut.  Yeah, so we're leavin'...and those scumfuckers follow us out!  All the way to our car!  And they had the  Rent-A-Cops-on-Wheels  check if we were leavin' for sure.  What the fuck are we gonna do!?  Well, as pissed off as we were, we woulda done a lot.  Anyway, whats the moral?  Well, shows how much people love to flaunt their authority around...those dumbshits didn't have anythin' better to do then pick on some kids just out havin' fun.  Seriously, what was our crime?  Why did we get approached and not any other kids?  Discrimination?  Maybe.  Harassment?  Hell yes!  Like we didn't hear them the first time!  Arrgh, even re-telling the story gets me worked up!  Anyway, we'll branch off more on this later...More to come!

       'Rents on a rampage...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Heh, well here I am again, bloggin'.  It's pretty late (or early, depends how you look at it) in the night (or mornin', depends on how you look at it) and I'm still up for no fuckin' reason!  So, since I was doin' nothin', I thought I'd blog, since I don't really have anythin' else to do.  Plus, bloggin' doesn't require much effort, does it?  Well, actually, that's a false misconception!  It's really hard to come up with topics to talk about on here.  It really sucks sometimes, and yer just like "Dammit!  I don't know what to blog about!" and all desire for writing a blog is lost.  Trust me, thats been the case many times with me.  I go on, all happy, and ready to blog.  Type in my username and password...yeah we're gettin' somewhere.  Then the  "Create New Post"  page pops up.  The little cursor in the empty text box blinks...and blinks...and blinks...just an utter annoyance...calling...mocking...teasing...It drives you into the dark recesses of insanity and then yer like "Ah screw this, I don't havta prove myself to you, you fuckin' cursor thing!"  Then the arrow, controlled by the mouse, which happens to be controlled by me, goes up to the top right-hand corner of the page and clicks angrily on the little "X" which closes the page and begins what I like to call  "idle time" , where I stare at the bright ass fuckin' compooter screen (yes, I am in the semi-darkness of our compooter room...oh slightly sexual...and unnerving) and wait for someone to rescue me from my own insanity.  Oh wow, I was reminded of that song that goes  "Wake me up inside (I can't wake up!) somethin' somethin' somethin'..."   I forget, cuz I don't really listen to that crap.  Hey, but this time its different!  I didn't go insane!  Hah!   J.R-1, Society-0 !  Suck a dick, bitch!  Right, recently I got in a spot with my  old man .  Not that this is uncommon, but it has been awhile, and I was rather enjoyin' it.  Whatever.  Anyway, it happened a few days ago, and it was my utmost intention to blog about it here...but I forgot what happened sorta...I know my dad did raise his voice...I talked back, provoking...he raised a vacuum threathingly as if he was goin' to dash my brains out with it...oh yeah, OK!  I guess he was mad at me cuz my room isn't exactly clean.  And he was mad cuz I sleep til like two in the afternoon or somethin'...as if that was a crime, really.  Oh yeah, and both my 'rents were mad at me cuz I stay up all night on the compooter and havin' phone sex (haha J/K) with my supposed girlfriend  Elyse .  Isn't that lovely?  Yeah, I got in trouble for it, and I've been caught over and over again.  Luckily, they aren't very good at enforcin' punishment, so I can consider myself lucky, can't I.  Well, enough about me, how about you guys!?  Hey, that  Operation: Revolution  really needs to get started!  Who the fucks in charge of this pla-oh...oops its me!  Damn my own laziness!  Right, I'll try guys, I really will!  I was also thinkin' of postin' lyrics for songs on the blog every now and then...A nice little treat you know?  Well thats it for now...More to come...!

       Insanity is such a tragedy for us to see...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Hey everybody!  Heh, just online screwin' around again.  Pretty bored though, cuz my buds  Nick  and  Elyse  and a few  other people  are online, but they are either not there, or I'm tryin' to refrain from talkin' to them.  God, I need someone to talk to, or I'll seriously go crazy.  Have any of you ever had this thing...this thing that you really, really liked, actually...this person, that you really liked, and you wanna talk to them so bad, but you can't?  Have you ever wondered if that person that you like happens to like you back?  And all these thoughts are buzzin' around in your head, and you don't know what to think anymore?  Sounds like some crazy openin' for an infomercial...anyway, yeah.  I am in that current position, and its drivin' me crazy.  OK, you guys gotta stay by me on this one...I don't think I can get through it without everyone by my side.  Fuck...life couldn't suck anymore.  Man, this isn't a very good blog...the urge to blog....slowly...decreasin'...the urge to kill...slowly...steadily...never existing.  Haha, OK...with your help, I'm goin' long and goin' strong!  Yeeeeaaah!  More to come...!

       Back to the known (again)...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   OK, OK...I finally got my lazy ass to get on this stupid thing and type up another blog!  So please, stop sendin' me angry letters listin' different ways you want to kill me and what you wanna do with my decapitated body!  Anyway, its about time and got a new blog out there!  Its been awhile huh?  Yeah, I don't need tellin' twice, I've got  Nick  and  Elyse  for that.  Right, well yer prolly thinkin' "Why'd you isolate yourself from the bloggin' community like that?"  Well, first off, I didn't isolate myself, I just didn't really get a chance to blog, or did get the chance, but never took it.  Well, update time!  Hmm, how goes it with you guys?  Still strugglin' by huh?  Me too!  But thats life huh?  I haven't done much.   Summer school  ended like a week ago today.  What?  You guys didn't know I went to  summer school ?!  Whoa, its been that long huh?  Heh, well long story short, I failed  second semester of English 2 , so I had to make it up.  Dunno if I passed my  summer school class ...gotta check up on that.  I had  Mr. Mummert .  Nice teacher, blah blah blah...anyway...yeah that was  summer school .  Yes, it was like hell.  Yes, it sucked.  Yes, I missed all my friends (aww).  But, thats outta the way now...  I'm pretty sure by now that everyone knows that  Josh  and  Naoki  came back from  Japan .  I saw great footage that included a river crab and a suckling baby monkey!  Wow!  They said they brought back souvenirs, but I haven't gotten any yet!  Hey guys, where are the fuckin' souvenirs!?  Just kiddin'.  They brought some great stuff back too.  You wanna know what they brought back?  OK, well....ask them yourselves.  One thing I got accomplished was  driving school .  Yeah, I can go get my  permit  and  license  now, so that means  I'll be drivin' legally from now on ...I'll blog about  my misadventures in the driving class  in a later blog.   Hmm what else?  Oh, nothin' much happenin' on the  Operation: Revolution  front...gotta work on that.  Damn, I am such a fuckin' lazy ass aren't I?   Well, yeah I just noticed I have tons of summer stories for you guys, but we can put those aside for later.  You'll just havta wait I guess.  Don't give me that look, I gave you a lot of practice!  More to come...!

       Friday's not forgotten...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Heh!  Alright, I'm finally gettin' off my lazy ass and bloggin'!  Yeah, I know, its been like a week since my last post, but lets put the past behind us eh?  There's so much shit to talk about, I dunno where to start...I guess we can start with last  Friday , because that fuckin' deserves some merit!  OK, so  Friday ...well it all started out with school.  Like slaves we did toil through the tedious hours of school.  And not just on  Friday  either.  The whole week served up a shitload of...well shit.  So pretty much, like all kids, we anticipated the weekend...a brief two-and-a-half days(cuz  Friday  we have school for a little bit, but after school we are free to do what we please with the remainin' hours of the day) escape from the burdens of reality.  Anyway, basically school was suckin', shit was happenin', and we were all draggin' ourselves through the week.  So when  Friday  came, it was met with open arms, and legs if yer a whore like I am...haha.  Anyway, a last-minute plan was drafted by  Eddie  and  me  to go to  Castle Park  and tackle the arsenal of  arcade games  that the Castle has to offer.  So after  my mom  dropped us off in the creepily deserted parking lot (I think the Castle is goin' through repairs or somethin') and we marched our way through the cheesy "drawbridge" style doors...  ...and we found that the arcade as almost as empty as the parking lot!  I swear!  It even rivals the emptiness of  Nick's  crotch!  Anyway, with the Park's play things at our perusal, we wasted no time runnin' over to the token machine.  I watched as the machine ate up a week's worth of  lunch money , but starvin' myself was worth it...oh my precious tokens!  Anyway, we started off with a little game of  Air Hockey .  I scored some points...too bad they went to  Eddie  since I happened to knock the fuckin' puck into my own goal so many damn times!  So yeah, I got prison-raped at that game...anyway, we moved on over down to the  old school  section of the arcade where we played  The Simpsons  and kicked major ass at it!  Seriously, we beat the game!  The game wasn't the only thing I wanted to beat...these annoyin' ass  Ninos del Inferno  ( "Children from Hell"  [they were  Mexican , hence the  Spanish ]) kept tryin' to talk to us and I was ready to put  my joystick  (yeah, that one) in one of their mouths and gag them to death.  Anyway, the we played  skeeball  and shot some hoops (yeah we did!)...then we moved onto  The House of the Dead , where  Eddie  and  me  we're two brave agents fightin' an army of undead monsters and such.  We were livin' out our life long childhood dreams!  That game pretty much ate up all of our tokens, and after havin' the words "Reload!" shouted at me, I was ready to go.  We beat that game too by the way (Freaks!).  Anyway, with my last token, I played  Galaga , which has always been a favorite of mine.  After that, we took our game tickets to the conunter and I got  a whistle  and  Eddie  got some  fake lips  (contrary to the ones he has between his legs).  With no where to go, we did what every other high school kid does when they don't have shit to do...we headed off to the mall!  It was pretty funny, cuz we knew  Liz  and  Elyse  would be there, so it was an earnest ambition to ambush them at the mall.  It was pretty sad though, cuz our own stupidity foiled our devious plot.  Even though we knew our plan was ruined, we still tried to fool them anyway.  On the way to the mall, bored and extremely dangerous, we searched the streets, lookin' for fun.  Our eyes (all three of them) fell upon an unlikely diversion... a shopping cart !  Like a bad little punk rock kid, I wanted to push  Eddie  in it, but I don't think he wanted to get in...so then I thought we could at least ride it.  So I hoped on the back,  Eddie  took the front, and we charged down the sidewalk in our makeshift  G-ride .  Yellin' and swearin', we made our way down the street constantly stoppin' to avoid veerin' off into the grass and some palm trees.  It was really fun, and I've got the scars to prove it!  After our episode with the cart, we headed to the mall.  We walked around and we went into the  No Fear Store  and I showed  Eddie  where I got my shirt, which is so fuckin' koolaid!  Anyway, it happened to be near the  Sharper Image  store, where  Liz  and  Elyse  were.  We tried to hide from them, but they spotted us, and we ran up the escalator to escape the clutches of evil!  There was no use tryin' to ditch them, as they were trailin' us like a bunch of angry prostitutes who we hadn't paid for the bad blowjobs they gave us!  We shot into the  Gamekeeper  and sought sanctuary there.  Only the fat ass cashier, armed with his bucket gun that shot gusts of air at you (a la "queaf" style) ratted us out and they found us.  So then we went to the  Sharped Image  store, our party now four.  I had an OK time havin' the metal penises encased within comfy leather armchairs fuck my back for me.  It was really quite nice, and they also had gargantuan dildos appropriate named  "back massagers" .  Just face it, they're just big dildos.  No use tryin' to hide that fact from the little ones.  And come on...one of 'em was called  "The Thumper."   'Nuff said!   Eddie  tried to put one in my mouth and made me bite my lip...ouch!  Anyway, we left cuz the propreitors were givin' us dirty looks.  I was pretty hungry and we went to  Pacific Grill .  I offered to buy the girls so  Freedom Fries  from  McD's , but they refused.  Oh well, its yer ass that'll be hungry and not mine.  After that, we went  Spencer's  and had fun listenin' to keychains have orgasms, testin' out lube (that smelt horrily like latex), whips and French ticklers, tryin' on masks, and lookin' at fat chick porno b-day cards!  It was really koolaid and kick ass, and I had so much fuckin' fun!  After that,  Eddie  and  I  had a cravin' for  Pop Rocks  and went to the  Sweet Factory  in search of them.  I was lost in Pop Rock-goodness...*drooling*  Anyway, I had to use the bathroom after that, and so we went, and thats when  Liz  and  Elyse  parted ways with us...or so we thought.  Seein' how as after they left, we had nothin' else to do, we headed out to where they were waitin' for their ride and waited with them.  There was a little squabble over where each of us should sit...blah blah.  Anyway, after they left,  Eddie  and  I  checked out  EB Games , then walked our asses over to  Sportsmart , strictly for the nostalgic value and because they have a water fountain and Pop Rocks make you thirsty.  Then we headed to  Petco  and after 15 or 20 mins. of "oozin' ahhs" we waited outside for our ride and played with my cell phone.    All in all, great night out with my fuckin' best buds in the world!  We gotta do it again sometime.  It was so kick ass and so fuckin'....."koolaid!"  The mere memory of that day makes me long for the weekend once more!  More to come...!

       Parents on a prick parade...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Ah!  Another fine blog from the infamous P.R.E.  What the fucks goin' on guys?  Things are seriously goin' haywire around here.  Really!  As if life wasn't complicated enough, huh?  Seems like things are kinda outta whack...Alright!  To business!  Lotsa shit is happenin' here on the  P.R.E. !  Guess what?!  I think I'll finally be able to launch the long-procrastinated on  Operation: Revolution !  Koolaid, huh?  I know!  I'm fuckin' psyched!  Anyway, its been such a long ass time since I proposed that  Operation: Revolution  take place, that I kinda forgot exactly what would be changin'.  I've had some time to think about different improvements I can put on here, and I think I have a definite plan layed out.  Here's what I've thought up:     1.   The Face of Change.   If you hadn't already noticed, the  P.R.E.  got a brand new look just a few days ago, and I think it looks really kick ass!  Erm, I'm not done remodelin' the bitch yet though.   HTML  can really be a fuckin' whore.  I'm not to good at it either.  Anyway, I did the white-on-black scheme (no, I assure you I was not motivated by the white-on-black hate crimes that occur so frequently but go so unnoticed in this country) and I'm pretty happy with it.  So that means "I'm not fuckin' goin' to change it if you don't like it."  Nah, I'm just kiddin', but most of you (well three of you) said it looked OK, so lets just stick with it, alright?  Oh, I'll try to post up links to yer blogs too guys.  Gotta show the love.  I'm gonna try to put up links to some sites I think you guys should take a look at, like....oh!  There was this one gay porno site that had the best "anal fuckin' in shower" scene I ever-haha I'm only playin' with ya...or am I?       2.   Sound Bites!   Well, you guys all now how obsessed I am with music.  I mean, come on, its like the best fuckin' way to get yer opinion out there.  So, I thought up of a little thing I like to call  Sound Bites!   This interestin' little column is gonna be my sorry ass attempt to bring you the latest news in  punk, ska, and hardcore .  I'm gonna try and post up CD reviews, stories, tour dates, and band info.  Ah, what the fuck, I'll even have flashbacks and throw in some  80's  and  oldies ! How fuckin' awesome is that gonna be!?  Hopefully I can get that started up soon.  It sounds really fuckin' cool!        3.   Just take a look, its in a book!   Hey, why not follow  Nick's  example and try to throw in a few book reviews?  I know what yer thinkin'.  Right when I mentioned  Nick  and  books  you prolly thought "God, how fuckin' boring!"  (Haha, I'm just kiddin'  Nick !)  But, hey, lemme take a shot at it.  I mean, what have I got to lose, you know?  Anyway, I'll try to pick up interestin' titles and read 'em and discuss 'em on here and try to tie them into our lives.  Oooh, sounds like an English assignment.  Whoop-dee-frickin'-doo!       4.   Punk Rock Karaoke!   I thought maybe it'd be fun to post up lyrics here on the  P.R.E. !  I mean, there's so many freakin' songs out there!  I dunno, it sounds like a cool idea.  No, I won't limit lyrics to just  punk rock songs  (although that genre will be the majority on here [No shit, huh?!]).  Just like with  Sound Bites! , I'll put up some  oldies  and  80's  and some other shit.         5.   Don't hate, participate!   Yeah, I want you guys (yeah all fuckin' five or six of you) to send me some feedback dammit!  This ain't just my blog...its a blog for the modern thinkin' public.  I wanna know what you guys think and stuff (Aww aren't I considerate?).  Yeah thats right, gimme suggestions on how to make this site more kick ass (then it already is!).  Hey, you might be able to score some recognition!  Drop me a line motherfuckers!  Even if they're angry letters!  Oh yeah, my address is  ThEPuNkRoCkKiD13@aol.com .  So, all in all, just expect to see some new things comin' up on the  P.R.E. .  OK, now...there's somethin' really weird goin' on.  Or maybe I was just totally oblivious to it or...or somethin'.  But recently, there's been a rise in aggressiveness received from parents, or at least mine.  I dunno about yers, but well mine...I noticed an increase in arguments and stuff.  I mean, if you know me, I'm no stranger to the lecture and things like that...but...hmm...damn.  I've got a mental block.  Actually, I didn't anticipate to blog this long, and I gotta go do my homework...So, I'll come back on tomorrow and continue on...More to come...!

       This is just a punk rock blog, written for the people who see something's wrong...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Heh, hey!  Here's another brand new fuckin' blog comin' at ya faster than...somethin' thats fast!  OK, well today's slogan (the thing up there that is followed by the phrase  "...its the Punk Rock Editorial!" ) came for the song  "Punk Rock Song"  by  Bad Religion .  Just givin' them the recognition they deserve, you know.  Anyway, lotsa things have been goin' on recently and everyone is fuckin' busy.  Whats the cause?  I'll tell ya in a second!   School!   Yeah, thats right, if you hadn't heard me bitchin' about it before, we've embarked on yet another journey, another quest to attain knowledge.  Sounds like an epic conquest!  Anyway, yeah school has started, and I'm still tryin' to get back into the cycle.  You know, stayin' up all night when I was on vacation really screwed up my internal clock thing...so I'm tryin' to fix it up.  School's been pretty good though and I've been havin' a lot of fun so far.  Heh, yeah from now on you are prolly gonna be hearin' me talk more about school because...school is now (once again) takin' up a large time slot on my time tables.  Yay!  Alright, somethin' I havta address.  As some of you know,  Nick  has about three blogs, which include:   Go Ahead and Read This Only if You Dare , the  T.E.W. , and somethin' he calls  Rants .  Well last night, I was doin' my regular check up on all the blogs, seein' if there has been anythin' new posted or whatever.  Well, he did an article on  "teasing, heckling, and blah blah."   So he talked about how the  "cycle of teasing"  has to somehow be broken.  You know, read the article for the full story.  Sorry  Nick , but that is the biggest bullshit I've ever heard!  Breakin' the cycle of teasin' huh?  Thats sorta impossible.  Because the thing you refer to "the cycle" has always and will always exist.  There's no way you can disrupt the cycle because its there and its one of those things that doesn't need any verbal recognition to justify it's existence!  Everyone, yes everyone, gets fuckin' teased by someone else.  Yeah, even if some people get made fun of more than others, there really isn't anythin' you can do to stop that from happening.  Does anyone remember those tips they used to give us back in elementary school on how to handle situations with teasing?  How they told us to say "please stop" or to just walk away?  Yeah, well they were fuckin' idiots to say that because you would expect adults to remember how school was, how bein' young was, and how, if you used those bullcrap techniques to try and avoid a confrontation, you'd be worse off.  If anythin', those "techniques" for avoidin' a fight provoked more than they did pacify.  But teasin' doesn't stop in elementary school.  Remember junior high?  Everyone was fuckin' conscious of themselves because we were goin' through so many transitions at that time, it was hard not to get picked on.  And bein' a kid, I know how kids are...we're discriminatory idiots and it was either pick on or be picked on.  Its the same way in high school.  Yeah, we're sposta act "mature" or some bullshit like that because we're gettin' older and its expected of us.  First of all, who are they to fuckin' set standards for me and tell me that I havta live up those fucked little standards?  Anyway, even in high school people get teased.  And teasin' doesn't stop there.  Elementary, intermediate, and high school are just little models of what society really is.  Look at them.  Can't you see it?  Those stupid little "levels of society" may not have been apparent, but they're there.  In school, you've got the popular kids...jocks and cheerleaders...you know, the elite...Then you've got the middle class, where the majority of kids are...then there is the band dorks, nerds, geeks, and the smelly kids.  School is an impeccable little clone of what society is really like.  You may not know it, but yeah, people are classifyin' us into little castes right now.  Or maybe this is just my fucked up perception.  But here's what I think...teasin' and hazin' is just a fuckin' part of growin' up...its one of life's fucked up little lessons so you gotta accept it...you can't go through life without be made fun of who you are, cuz you know what?  We live in a fuckin' world where variety is both a good and bad thing.  Though our beliefs, opinions, ideas, gender, ethnicity, background, appearance...,basically the things that define who we are, seperate us from everyone else and makes us "individuals," the problem is that it seperates us from everyone else and makes us "individuals."  You can't expect people to coexist peacefully.  People are always goin' to discriminate...people are always gonna form stereotypes...accept it.  Not everyone is goin' to agree with you, and not everyone is goin' to tolerate you.  Right now, whoever might be readin' this is either noddin' their head vigorously in agreement, or is shakin' there head and brandishin' a fist at the computer screen.  Big deal to me.  I say,"Right on!" cuz that means they are fuckin' stickin' to their beliefs.  I'm not here to tell you whats right or wrong.  I'm just tellin' you what I think, not teliin' you what to think.  Anyway, people only make you feel inferior with your consent.  They are just one person outta who knows how many who dislike you.  As long as you know who you are, then fuck what they say.  RIght?  I mean, yeah, I've been to those points where its just like "I can't take it!" but hey, its like a shot or an enema...its over before you know it.  Their is some psychology behind hazin' as well.  Make them look stupid so that you look better.  Yeah, kinda like an ego boost.  Its stupid, but I admit that I still talk shit about people...cuz you know what?  Its fuckin' fun...and sorry, some people set themselves up to be made fun of (i.e. big mouth girl who is very fat and wears see through pants so we can see her fat asshole devour here poor little sky blue underwear!).  Anyway, I know my limits.  Its kinda weird how kids get teased and then they decide that the best retaliation is to shoot up the place.  If you seriously brood on bein' made fun of that much, then you've got a problem.  You care too much of what others think that you kinda forgot what you think.  You know what kind of person you are.  Don't let other people change the perception you have of yourself.  Only you have the right to do that.    That hasta be the fuckin' longest blog I have ever written.  Course, you can expect more of this right here on the  P.R.E.   I think I wanna continue on this topic...of school shootings and what not.  Strange how things branch off...and well I had been talkin'  Elyse  about this stuff last night.  Remember though..."Your point of view, it belongs to you/No one can take it away."  Sorry listenin' to  Pennywise's  new album,  From the Ashes !  Yeah, it comes out  Sept. 9th .  How am I listenin' to it you ask?  Bootleg connections, bee-otch!  Alright, I'll do another blog later.  Maybe it'll be longer?!  Who knows!  More to come...!

       "Let's do somethin' Thursday...OK...Friday....Arrgh!  Alright, Saturday"...its the Punk Rock Editorial!   Heh, wow, how long has it been this time...a week?  A month?  Eh, who's keepin' count anyway?  ( Nick )  Whoever is, fuck you...bastards.  Anyway, haven't been on in a while and haven't blogged in an even longer while so...yeah...I'm on now, so why don't I blog?  I'm doin' that right now, dumbass.  So anyway, I had a pretty good day today.  In fact, it really kicked ass, if you ask me.  I went out with my bestest bud in the whole-wide-motherfuckin'-world,  Eddie .  Damn, dude, we've been chillin' a lot huh?  Fo sho!  It took us awhile to get it all planned out though...shows how retarded we really are...  Anyway, it started with  Eddie  havin' a charge on a book (Oh no,  Nick !  A crime against humanity!) he checked out like a little while ago.  Luckily, he noticed in time and had to pay a small fine...unlike me, where I've got like a  $30.00+  charge ( Nick  is now chantin' "Hang him!  HANG HIM!") on my library card.  It sucks...I wanna pay it off, but I always end up spendin' my saved up lunch money on other crap.  Anyway, the  CPL  is just a bunch of whores who freakin' havta charge shitloads of money for there stupid ass books.  Seriously...I've seen yer books guys...they ain't in "mint-condition"...stop lyin' to yerselves!  And then they got that fuckin'  Project Parental Choice  (a.k.a.  Project Another Sorry Ass Attempt to Protect Your Kids' Minds from the Evils of An Evil Society ).  What happened to the kids' choice?  What happened to our freedom, eh?  We've got minds of our own you know, we can think for ourselves...and anyway, what are they tryin' to hide from us?  They got porn and shit stashed in the shelves or somethin'?  Really...come on...  Anyway, sorry I branched off on that... Gary  dropped us off at the mall, and another misadventure begins!  Its weird, cuz goin' to the mall on weekends has become like a ritual for us or somethin'.  Watch us devolve into the mall rats we swore to ourselves that we wouldn't become!  Hey, the mall is fuckin' fun OK.  Hah, its pretty funny, cuz we never have any cash to spend on things, so we just walk around and say things like,"Oh!  Hey, look at that!  I wish I could have that!"  Or we just spend our money on stupid shit that doesn't really matter.  Today, though, we had a little cash, and so we got to do a little spendin'...In fact, I was goin' to the mall with the prospect that I would be  makin'  cash...We walked our asses on over to  EB Games  and I thought I'd trade in one of my video games.  Turns out that the piece of shit was worth  $4 !  Ah, fuckin' douchebags!  Oh well,  Eddie  got to reserve this  Star Wars  game he wanted and I got $4 out of it...so why not go on a spendin' spree?  We did...or well..I did...at the arcade!  Yep, we headed over to  Tilt  and played our new  Arcade Game of the Week .  Its this game called  CarnEvil .  Its yer classic first-person shooter with the undead roamin' around tryin' to hurt you (What the fuck did we ever do to you guys!?), but with a creepy amusement park settin'.  Its so fuckin' koolaid, somebody, anybody, go and play it!  Bring a friend!  You guys will laugh yer asses off!  I know we did!  Anyway, I kept tryin' to win at this game for suckers, which I obviously am, and kept losing...I see a gambling problem in the not so distant future, don't you?  After that, I thought we should just walk back to my house (neither of us can drive legally) and so we did, laughin' our asses off about things that really aren't even that funny...Hey!  We think they are...so fuck off!  After like 30+ mins. and a broken beer bottle later...we arrived at my house...only to find that the doors were all locked, no one home, and no way to get in...Great!  But wait!  Next door neighbor to the rescue!  I asked them to use their phone (nervously, cuz thats the kinda person I am) and yeah...I got a hold of my sister and luckily she was headin' back home as we were speakin'.  So that was cool and I found out that one of the chicks next door was pretty fuckin' cute.  Anyway...yeah we got in...and I got to show  Eddie  this super koolaid new game I got called  Disgaea: Hour of Darkness .  I oughta blog about that later.  I also let him listen to the  Freestyle Latin Hip-Hop CD  that we've got, and we laughed once more at the synthesized goodness!    After that, we went to  Norm's  and I found out  Eddie  was a  Norm's Virgin , so it was his first time.  With my guidance, as well as my sisters  Stacie  and  Chu-Chi , we were able to make it comfortable for  Eddie  and things went smoothly.  Heh,  Eddie , we got to try the  gumbo !  Oh yeah, we saw  Brittany McCorkhill  she's changed...wow...Anyway...we had a pretty good dinner, despite the annoyin' little girl that was bawlin' two tables over (Whats wrong bitch?  You hot?  You got a feeva?), crazy guy with an even crazier laugh, and of course our waitress, which  Eddie  appropriately donned the name  Purple Petunia  who was nice, I guess, but she didn't really come back to our table to ask if we needed anythin'...which she shoulda, cuz  me  and  Eddie  ordered that little "steak with all the shrimp you can eat" dealie (Bitch, I ain't no fishamen...I can't catch this shit mah-self!)  All in all, we had a pretty good fuckin' time, and it was the highlight of my weekend, so yeah...had to share that with you all!  OK OK, more to come...!

       Punk's NOT dead!  Its the Punk Rock Editoria!   Oh, WHOA!  Man, I'm havin' a total flashback right now.  Have you ever had this feeling...where you stumble upon somethin' you'd long forgotten...and yer like,"Holy shit, how could I forget about this!?   This  was so awesome!"  Well. if yer able to identify with the emotion I just described...I'm totally havin' one of those moments!  Ya see...um...I kinda like...alright...not "kinda"...I just really fucked up and skirted the details on bloggin' and what not and as a result, this blog has been left untouched, unrevised, and thus, became unnoticed.  Hey!  Its kinda like that food you had last weekend but forgot about and then find like a week later and its all..."Bleah!" and you don't wanna touch it and stuff...What the hell am I sayin'?  The scary thing is...I dunno...even more scarier is that I asked you guys!  And you guys are total retards!  But seriously, I just got totally lazy and shit and I didn't have as much freedom with my time as I did before school started.  If you hadn't noticed, the number of new blogs posted stopped an  extremely  long time ago, around the time when the school year had begun.  I would get urges to blog all year, but then I lose that determination to blog a couple of minutes later...in fact...meh...I'm losin' interest again...eh...We'll see when the need to type up and post up journalistic gold comes back to me...Until then, go fuck yerselves...More to come...!
