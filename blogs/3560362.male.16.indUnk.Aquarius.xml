      Mornin, its a hard knock life, for me. Today, had general studies n key skills introduction n talk, and the had games. Had beast of a game of hand head ball, in which, Richie and myself carried our team, Tom gt kneed in the balls, and we saw.... him, prancing about like a fat ballerina. Rough game, i recieved many a bruise, and gave many to those around me. Brilliant when a game like that becomes competitive cos it gets so violent. Then 2nite, finally came out (thanks jay) and had a chat with the old skool crew including Colley and Courtney. Colley then left with Courtney due to unforseen circumstances. Then I recieved a tackle straight outta the Division THREE handbook (thanks jay... ho) and tore me kex, which led to the tearing of my flesh. Lots of blood, and banged my ear on the railing, which hurt more. Delivered a few blows to jays kidneys and general torso. Then came in n spoke 2 lu, which is always nice. She's nt goin with "El Cocko" now, it was Danny that changed her name 2 Louisa hearts Danny. Anyway, best go shower, I'm hot lol. Laterrrrr

      So, another day, another blog. Nothin this mornin, then the afternoon came around n I went round to Chippy's to play LMA 2001 again, beast, 2nd in La Liga behind an immense Real Madrid, who's strike force is now Morientes and... Marian Pahars! My three bein Arjen Robben, Adrian Mutu and a player I like to call John Thomas, but we only actually know about him that he's written down as J. Tomas. Came home to a gorgeous roast dinner, then the compliment war began again with Lu. 2nite, FUCK ALL happened, n was bollox. props do go out to tom for revealing details on happenings to me and this comment on Lu's name:  "omg, strange, bit sad her name tho, as if any1 wud wana take danny off her, lol, shees such the mazin tho"  Made me laugh alot. Can't wait to finish my exams after 2moro, Business the last ever, for a year. Goin job huntin this week too. Later readers.

      Evenin, odd 2day n 2nite. 2day, gt up @ 11 mazin n jst played champ man 4 a bit, got bored of it so left it afta a while. 2nite, went out later than usual, n yesterdays bad feelin followed thru 2 2day. Ad couple games of red arse, good games, bit of bitchin like but no less than usual; just directed differently. Then as we left, cocks came out, nt literally, but heads frm beyond the Brookhurst boundaries n kicked off on chippy. Felt for him as i was in the same situation couple of months ago n itll haunt him 4 a while now. Went to Ste's to avoid the fightin, n gt picked up by his dad. Saten went on his role, he got out of the car, ad a go, the heads laid, n the best line being:  "Don't be a tit all of your lives"  I honestly thought he was gna hit them as he edged closer with the swear words poundin out like a good boom box n sum top hardcore choonz. Then came home n beat Mike at This Is Football 2004 with Rooney being superb. Then I came here. Had a chat with Lu n Tal, n dey both luvly, I had a compliment war with Lu about each others eyes, cos she has got gorgeous eyes. Anyway, I'm off, later.

      Indifferent 2day. History exam, n cudnt b arsed, fink it was about 5 mins in when i lost interest. 2day, did fuck all really, jst chilled, n i was disgusted that sum1 had robbed my barrel of ready made ribena, bastards. 2nite odd, went a la park wiv the fellaz n jess n georgia. Daz seemed kinda drunk, jess was leathered afta a while n georgia was ok. Played bit of fooz, gt bored n chattin wiv jay n ben 4 a while, tom comin in every now n again, n jay insulted him, mazin. Im laffin now actually lol. Random abuse. Then bailed bk 2 jays afta standin around a jess who was as pissed as a fish, n was nice sit off. Nice bit of haribo, den came home. france gone out tho, well good, still doesnt contemplate 4 our departure thanks to old bullshit decion referee, hope he gets murdered SOON!  Come on the Hooligans! Poor Darius, Poor Wayne, dey both cried/close 2 tears. Hate Garth Crooks, later.

      Feelings: Gutting, Robbed, Annoyed, EXTREME hatrid 4 that shit house of a ref  As u can guess, England lost, fucked off. We wer robbed by that..... argh! TWAT of a referee, disallowin perfectly good goal frm Sol, n gutted 4 Beckham n Vassel; Beckham didnt know about the ground n his technique shifted the ground beneath the ball n wen he struck it, flew in2 seat X-32. Vassel cryin at the end, he did well, n really wudnt have taken a penalty if Rooney hadn't been injured. We played well-ish tho, and my exact words in conversation wiv jay when Owen scored that fabulous but pointless goal were  Davies ™ - COME ON ENGLAND!!!!! says: get the fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck in!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Gutted man. Champ Man still here tho, but not really in2 that now. Chippy's txt msg to me brought a smile to my face tho. Hooligans r gonna have a riot 2nite tho, go ed lads, do it 4 England, n while ur @ it, kill that fucking referee.  Nothin else happened 2day by the way, History exam 2moro as well, gna fail cos my mind'll be elsewhere, like thinkin of 2nite, the France game and obv wantin 2 c the girls. Later, and yes, the referee, is indeed, a wanker.

      Well, odd, yet hilarious. 2day, history exam, poor n quite hard. Then nothing, day time. But 2nite, amazin night. Went out in the pissin rain wiv tom-tom n jay, gt really wet, n played lil bit of fooz. Many disgusting thoughts n fantasies were airred by tom-tom n jay, disgusting. Then as it started to rain, tom's pants became... clingy... and jay came running over screaming like a girl having her fallopian tubes torn out by a pitbull wiv chilli sauce on it's teeth. We ran. Then, as we came closer 2 the exit, i kicked the ball with enough precision 2 get tom-tom in the penis. "ARRRRRGH!!!!" was his exact scream lol, then he claimed it was bleedin. We then bailed, myself n tom-tom having a puddle fight on the way home, and i eventually got him in the face. That's all, and champ man is quite the game. Later

      Sorry 4 lack of blog last night, discovered the joy that is Champ Man, was on it til 2:30. Och, gta luv Corner Shop, just come on again. There's dancing, behind the movie scenes... Anyway, cnt remember y'day, eeva drugged up, drunk, hungover or a day of nothingness, the latter bein the likliest. 2day, lack of defining events again. I went the dentist, despise it now, they numbed me up for a good 5 hours, disgrace. Only the grace of a Cadbury's McFlurry brought my mouth bk 2 life. Everybody needs a bosom for pillow... o song again. That's about it 4 2day, borin day. Now it's lashin down outside, gta go in 4 history exam 2moro, not nice. And I'm desperate to start my footy season 4 my new team, really am dyin 2 play. Anyway, still not seen girls 4 what mst be over a month now, shockin, n still miss them loads. Later, n remember, everybody needs a bosom 4 a pillow.

      Yesterday, was all in all poor, nothing was acheived, poor. But the evening/night/next morning was beautiful. Was sittin off in Chippy's playin on LMA 2001! then gt randomly invited 2 his neighbour's party, den more randomness, his mother asked me to stay 4 t, then the randomheiner, asked 2 stay over. Fair do's. Lovely pasta for t and I'm doing well with Real Betis on LMA 2001. To the party... Played a bit of footy with Chip Nath n Ickle Sian, who was bloody good! Then, entered the atmosphere, grabbed a Stella n went had a chat with Becky n Roz Clare. Time went by, n beer was guzzled. The Stella became a bottle of bud each, Chip disliking the Bud went on2 a Kronenbourg. The Pinyata soon broke out, with every1 bar myself n Chip takin part in the whacking of a cardboard donkey, so we jst looked cool. The pinyata was still in good shape when we finished our beers, couple of john smiths now. Finally, the thing burst, sweets flew everywhere, sum fat girl jumped on everyone, killing 2 babies and a squirrel in the process. I managed 2 get myself a donkey leg and that set off a ritual between myself, Nathan and every1 else i saw thruout the night. A sit off was soon in order, and we were chattin 2 sum Faye bird. Chippy and Nathan though, both had plans 4 her b4 the night was thru. Couple more John Smith's were cracked open 4 Chip and I, and we went n spoke outside the front of the house. We discussed his options, he was blatently leathered and it was hilarious. His dad aka Saten, was onto so came to have a word, and as i re-call, this is wat Chippy said to his Dad:  "Rrr Dad, look at the cat, it hasnt been outside all day, n it needs a wee. I mean, I need to go in n let it out cos, just look at it, it's burstin. Could I have the keys please, so that i can let the cat out cos its sittin there sayin 'Let me out, I need a wee'"  Consequently, he was barred from the booze. I however, went n got myself a nice can of Castlemaine XXXX, then began the battle with Faye over why she wouldn't go out with Chippy, and I cudnt be arsed but did play messenger boy along with little shamu girl. After that little escapade, chippy accepted he had been turned down. Whilst coming to terms with that, i had a little chat with Becky n Roz's mum about how drunk chippy was, funny stuff. Then we had a coupla burgers frm the all night bbq, and went n had a little sing along n dance with Roz n ppl in the kitchen. Beast it was. One last beer 4 me, n got meself another Castlemaine, lovely. We then just sat off n watched everything happen around us. After a while we went bk 2 Chippy's house n gt a pack of crisps, then came bk. Sat off for a bit longer, n I had a chat with Becky n her mates bout skool n who I know frm skool that they know. me to actively talk to n chippy to actively fancy lots. Went 2 Chippy's; died.  Woke up this mornin, no hangover's on site, n Chippy's Dad, made a lovely English Breakfast. Came home 2 find Champ Man on me desk after my cousin rejected it, laffin. Fuck all else happened 2day, apart frm a quick chat 2 Lu on MSN about needin 2 c each other. Portugal beat Spain too, which I'm gutted about cos quite like sum of Spain's players (Vincente, Joaquin, Torres) and really hate the fact that wer gna b facin Portugal in the quarter finals after thrashing Croatia 2moro. And that's about it, don't expect many more blogs to be this long cos its taken ages n started 2 bore me. Nighty night people.

      Shite, only word describing the past 24 hours, shite.  OK, Tom gave me a stern talk to, well, sentence about how not 2 disrespect the blog. 2day, got up, n went out wiv Ben, knocked on Tom n Jay, n sat in Tom's 4 so long, losing a leaf up his sub woofer in the livin room, powerful stuff. Den games of fooz, crap really, didnt even finish. "nite, came out n was expectin sum heads at the park, the didnt disappoint. They were a distractin n annoyin presence thruout red arse, which tom recieved. Ben was particularly outstandin 2nite. Den stood about in the rain 4 a while, saw Katie, which was nice. Den off to Jay's for a bit, him n Tom reminissed whilst me n chip watched TV. Den came home n now im very bored. Bromborough fair 2moro, gonna invite Tal n Lu 2 come with Me n Chip, cos Jay n Tom dnt seem 2 b up 4 it. Of course dat'll change once they read this, cos they have very empty lives. Anyway, still a shite 24 hours. Later tosspot fucking shit houses. O, but Tal's cousin is bein so sound, gotta luv er.

      Evenin, 2day n 2nite so much better than I had visualised. 2day, had business exam and was so much easier dan i thought it would be, den came home n gt pure food, lovely. Sat off through the day, then on came the England game. The Duke bagged two n Mr Gerrard got the third, 3-0 to the lads. Then 2nite, oh, it was brilliant. First, we had a game, was good. Tried to push Danny Beamish out of the way, then realised his rugby build, wrong choice, but did a nice turn 2 panna him n redeem myself. Few good goals, can't remember any in particualr though. But the creme de la creme was yet to come. Red arse. Lasted a good hour n a half for 1 game n was best n funniest game in a while. The pick of the normal goals being a cruff-like flick to ben frm myself, he kept it up setting me up, then i hammered home a volley in2 the base of the net. But then, omg, the 9th goal, the header. Funny as shiz, so many changes and so many comical moments until finally, jay crossed the ball in frm behind the goal, i ran onto it and delivered a bullet header that flew over tom's head, the crowd went wild, and i celebrated like there was no 2moro. Delivered the red arse then bailed home. On return found out that Croatia had drawn wiv France 2-2, guttin wanted France to win. Anyway, may be out wiv Tal Lu n poss Nikki 2moro, first time in ages, rrr gotta luv em. Later

Brashaw CB S. Ashcroft CB M. Hughes LB S. Stuey (Dnt know stuey's surname so he's Stuart Stuey) DM D. Crescent RM S. Moore LM D. Sinnot AM A. Davies (C) RF B. Rogers LF J. Jardine  Pretty cool.

I enjoyed 2nite tho. Couple of games of red arse, which i recieved both red arses afta bein the most active and contributing player, cruel world lol. Then, game with the children, two of which play for blackburn wiv my cousins. I went on theirs, kicked sum ass maaan.Then the kids bailed n we played sum 4 on 4, beast, Me n Chip were a formidable force in the midfield, jay magnificent up front, tom... was there. Fell over nicely though to give us all a laugh. I gt kicked n bruised, n at the end 2 on 1, me against ste n sam, sam had a shot i kept it out, nice cruff turn 2 get away from sam, ran at ste den bit of a ronaldo, but ste brought me down with a disgusting tackle, throwing his knee in2 my quadracep, deading my leg, Paaaaiiin! Den came home n here i am. Lie in 2moro n only french so 2moro shudnt be so bad. Night.

      Well, again, sorry if i seem bit off 2nite, never been as sober as i am now.  2day was gud, went 2 vauxhall's 2 watch ben ref in a tournie, n der was a fair @ d same time. Can't remember the rest of the day. 2nite thru every emotion, ecstacy, fear, anger, disppointment, sadness, n sheer disbelief. Watched england game at bens, brilliant for 90 minutes, last two ruined the entire day. Zidane bein the phonominom that he is, scored a brilliant free kick, then a minute later, a superb penalty. The entire country fell silent. I was close to tears, ben goin thru how poor david james is, chip sat there, shell shocked. The long walk home's silence was only broken when we saw sum fuckin shit head of a dog draped in a french flag, fucking foreign bitch. Me, a very happy lad, full of laughs, hasnt laughed since barthez gt smashed in the face wiv the ball. Y DID HE TAKE ROONEY OFF!?! RRRRRRRR MY GOD!!!!!!! i want to kill someone. So down atm, hardly sed a word 2 tal, or my family, or any1. Got exams to look 4ward 2 2moro, n in english if there's a question "Describe a time when you went thru everything" Ill jst go thru 2day.

If we do play I'll skin im, snap im n slap im. But today, day off, luverlay. Got up, played Banjo Kazooie again, mazin game. Then went in2 the boro' village wiv Jay Ben n Thomas, nice bit of sayers confectionary 4 lunch. Walked bk, went in Ben's, few games of pool while the rain lashed down outside, beat him once, lol. Then sat off bk of the park, punishin jay 4 his comments about Tal. He took it well, props for that.  2nite, bit odd, walked down Bargain Booze n sum lad, maybe sanders, walked str8 at me 2 kick off, had 2 go on2 sum1s garden 2 avoid a smashin. Not fun. Then, bailed 2 jays n sat off, comical. Had ghetto experience smokin cigar. Sittin down on the floor, in an alley, wiv a cigar. Beast. And now, Im annoyed wiv gimp boy Nevitt. O well, 2moro's another day. Night.  LATER ADDED: I can't wait for this game 2moro, jay gna division 2 tackle nevitt. Bit arrogant but, I still feel on quite fine form, if not, on fire from trainin the other night. Just wanna embarass them all, n if they  try 2 snap, itll have 2 b an "El Gerrardo" two footed tackle frm myself. Tune in 2moro to find out how it goes. Farewell

      Evenin. I'm achin loads now after an intense work out at footy trainin 4 Beb Athletic men's team. Bagged myself a hat trick, with a wonderful final goal, takin it 2 the corner, flickin it round huuuge bloke, stepover 2 send matty the wrong way then slotted it home from the tightest of angles. Also gave matty a kickin and won the ball off him in the corner, beast. Apparently nothink happened 2nite elsewhere. Miss the girls sooooo much now! N sickenin stuff 2nite from Danny's mate on msn 2nite, eurgh!  Oh yeah, exams. English piss easy, IT key skills piss take. Some exams are just there to annoy u, and that key skills is one of them. The pathetic use of codey crap annoyed me most but then had finished afta 10 minutes wiv anuva 50 remainin. Jst made fun of the teahers the wiv Dawson, lol, Anne off Little Britain n Taws aka Hitler who cudnt open the door, tosser. Anyway, off 2moro n get a lie in den villagin it wiv jam master jay.

Well went maccies wiv tom 2&nbsp;meet doris' 1 and 2. Luvd the meal, but i was knackered. Then the fucking walk bak, o my god. Iv never bin wiv such slow walkers, and ppl who stop so much wen theyre talkin. So then sum hick dead had the idea 2 go 2 talbot's. Prolly tom, no point, jst nah. Then when we FINALLY got bk 2 the park, we got hiiigh. I stuck wiv the herbvilla n quite alot at that from the slowboat, grabbing it at every opportunity. I was quite blitzed. Tom was more drunk that blitzed. Colley n Daz man, so funny its unreal. And then i came in n went on msn n was havin serious mood swings. Rangin from depression to ecstacy. Weird. Funny tho tal, i wanted 2 talk 2 her or lu jst face 2 face or sumthin, i dont know y but i did. N now 2day, i may go in2 chester 2 get a shirt 4 2moro, or i may jst go 2moro. Laterrr

      Evenin y'all. Wat did i do 2day? Shite all. Well, that about covers the day. "nite was rather more eventful. Went trainin wiv Beb Ath, and i threw my heart in2 it, and was playing well, but about 15-20 minutes in, disaster. Ian ran at me with the ball, i jockied 4 a bit b4 using an inch perfect tackle to take the ball off him. I then gallopped like a stallion down the left wing b4 being nudged in the bk 2 to throw me slightly off balance. When trying 2 regain my balance i moved my leg and recieved another nudge which then jarred my quad and fucking me up 4 the remainder of the session. From that moment on i was crap. Then, gt home, had a shower, sat down 4 a bit; then off out i went. I didnt know if lu actually did want me in hers so txt jay, he sed he cdnt b arsed but tom was out sumwer. So gave tom a rang, he sed he was talkin 2 lu n tal n dey wer bout 2 go in2 lu's, so i bailed there. Sat off in her kitchen with tal's niece and make chicken's with towels. Then tal bailed with the baby and me tom n lu sat in the kitchen 4 a while then went in the living room 2 watch big brother. That geordie bird's annoyin and i hate nadia lol. Nooow, im knackered, in pain, and thinking "O my god! Lu's so fiiit!" Yeah well, later.

Erm well yeah, 2day, did bugger all day time wise, played spiderman 2 obv lol. Then 2nite went down the woods and had a spliff lol. Fuckin killed me off 4 the night. I then rang tom 2 find out where he was, then had 2 ring bk a minute later cos id 4got wat he'd sed. Then began an evenin of energy ups n downs. I went ffrm as hyperactive as a fucking hummingbird on speed to bein as dead as door nail. Sat off at the bk of the park 4 most of the evenin, but went on2 the actual park4 couple of games of red arse. I recieved one, ste gt the other. Then jst sat off; although it was a gud night 4 precision. I curled the ball perfectly on2 jay's bk several times, and he cudnt catch me so leathered the ball up in2 the air and rite in2 my path, and i just managed to bring it down. Also saw eleanor again 2nite, she jumped on my wen i was on the floor n wen sum1 sed dyu flirt with everyone? she sed 2 me no i only flirt with lads i fink r fit lol. O yeah havent mentioned the appearance by the Coll-mistro, gd 2 see him lol. Errr well thats about it.

      Howdy&nbsp;u fcuking wankeres, go fcuk urself u shower of twaats. I&nbsp;hope u all die pisising urselves when u realise the small&nbsp;amount of d!ck u have.  I didnt swear once in that sentence. Erm well, 2day... afta much lazing around n occasional spiderman 2 gameplays. Recieved the call from tom for a hike. We went up the shops and, the cash machine he longed for was out of order. Gutted. We then trecked to the village of bromborough and he withdrew ten notes from HSBC (Hermits Sucking Big Cocks). Then we sat off at the park criticising the Beamish boys and their cricketing skills, amateurs. Also, behind us were 2 lil kids playin footy, the match fixing and cheating was so evident it was unreal. O yeah, highlight of the day was seein a random man, with a smug luk on his face walkdown an alley, with a... wait for it.... trolley! Trampsbury's is down there i hear so he was jst doin the weeks shoppin. Then 2nite, came out n cricketeered. Bowled Jamie and Tom out for nothin, stayed in bat til 20 then declared; within that 20 was beautiful 6 which i nearly KO'd an old woman and her grandchild lol! Then bowled darren out 4 7. We then proceeded 2 the bk of the park n daz had his usual spliff lol. Thats bout it i fink. Im goin out wiv tal n lu soon hopefully if we manage 2 plan sumfink. Well 2moro, i will have been stoned when i blog. Im weak member, so a spliff is gna kill me lol. Later.

      Mornin. 2day, as&nbsp;eventful as it was, was wet. Went round to Jamie Baby's at around 2/3ish to play the brilliant Total Club Manager. Everton's fitness is a cause for concern but otherwise its all cushty. Then went to the shops n bought myself a cee-gar and haribo. We (me n jay) went bk 2 the park, i went west afta smokin it. But then daz n tom showed up, already blitzed. Darren then broke out a hee-yowge spliff lol, and smoked more or less all of it, n gave me a fair few toots on it. Me bein the amateur that i am wiv duh 'erb, was blitzed off it lol. I then proceeded 2 talk 2 myself about what baby rooster's would be called and chickens and other forms of poultry lol. Quite hilarious. Tom's suprisingly funny wen e's stoned too, n daz was... well daz always is funny. Drugs or not. Then after that spell lol went in. O yeah, chippy's ex eleanor lukd quite fit 2day wen we wer goin in. Then, came bk out afta t 4 cricket. Lack of effort was evident, there were no double figure scores, and the fact that we used a shite tennis ball 2 bowl with didnt help. Erm then, that was all, came in afta that n played spiderman 2. Now listenin to justified, superb album. Wanna jst talk 2 lu or tal, they so cool. Bestest girl friends in the world lol. Erm wanna get stoned again now, but i dont, cos really wanna b alrite 4 the season's start. Cos im obv gna get wrecked evry nite on me hols wiv me dad n even me brother mite b allowed a drink or 2 lol. Anyway, bail. Later.

      Late addition 2 blog; i retract all things sed about tom b4, well grim. Sum1 else has finally gone thru wat i went thru wen Lu gave me the best mate speech. Gutted for Tom like, cos evry1 was on2 his likin 4 helen so comes as a harsh blow him gettin the same speech. "Ain't no pain like that from the oppposite sex" a great rapper once sed... or maybe it was Will Smith. It's true tho, Tom wont b the same 4 a week or so now. I hardly spoke 4 a week n ull think about that n only that every minute of ur life for a day or two. But it's gone now, move on, life's full of twists n turns. Life's a bitch, but sumtimes it leaves behind it's permanent PMT for a while and itll all b mazin again. Taken frm experience.  A.P. Davies 24/7/04

      Howdy. 2day... well, i dont remeber most, but of wat i do remember, we played cricket. We each had an awwwful innings, i went for 2, Jay went for 3, and Tom went for... 0 or 1? lol! Well, things improved, as i didnt get bowled out afta that&nbsp;n am now on 25 not out. A sit off then followed and myself and Jamie let tom in on how the bees and the birds work. Well, jay's now going to kill tom afta he told hannah wat jay was doin 2nite. He hasnt gt an ounce of common sense to save his life, and also would jump off a bridge if a girl asked him, as he has no strength or restraint against wat girls ask. Iye iye iye. Well then 2nite; myself tal n lu went round 2 jays fo a sit off n the viewing of jackass. 3 words describe 2nite: Oh My Gosh! lol, this is in referral to how fucking fit tal n lu are, who we (me n jay, no tom hahahaha) are going to the beach with on a day which will remain secret unless tom asks tal or lu n lets face it, y wud they tell him? and wud he ever talk 2 them? Do not take the piss, he's intimidated by fit girls thats y... OOOOH, cud have broken hearts there but i wont haha. Anyway, as much as a rant about tom this is, let's hope 2moro brinigs a better blog, and also, wildboyz is on in half an hour! Yusss, later

        THE ATTACK OF THE TRIFFIDS !!!        &nbsp;   I am now watching a classic. It is in fact a film that really shud be named: When Venus Fly Traps Attack! lol. I mean seriously. If u cah-raaazy cats have ever seen Angry Beavers on Nickelodeon or wateva, it's one of the film's that u c norbert and dagget watchin, proper old skool. Me n Mills are now analysin it's awfulness. It's highly recommended for piss ups/stoner sessions. I love it in fact. God Bless America *salutes* in the words of mills. I REALLY cannot describe how unbelievably perfect this film is, i love it with all my heart. It's up there with Monkey, my second favourite film, second only to this. I love it, i cant stress enough how wmuch i do though. I love it. Iv nothin left to say, it's beautiful.

Then cricket again, I think its a first in bat thing, always seem 2 pick up a gud number of runs n a long stay, 2nd's always shortlived as thomas has demonstrated so many times and jay did 2day, and last is a good but are made to pay for ur mistakes innings.

      What was i thinkin b4? Sorry about that, i was on quite a hype and obviously affected my bloggin standards. 2day then, left the house around 12:45 and began an early days cricketing. Jay was in bat for quite some time makin it to... cnt rememeber, but it lasted a while. Tom, has a strange technique, for making every attempt to go for any ball, even if it means tearin ligaments n tendons to get there. Me, myself and I did OK in bowlin but only managed 2 get jay out once later in the day i think. Battin's gettin better all round tho for the group, with the run score's getting higher with every passing day. 2nite, iv jst sat n listened 2 my music n enjoyedthe likes of Meatloaf, Will Smith and DMX makin debuts on my playlist. Watched only fools n horses 2nite on me bill tho, cos me dad gt home late from work, didnt make it any lesws hilarious tho. N o my gosh, pimp my ride; some of their creations are fucking scandalous! A chandelier in the car? A ping pong table? A blender?! WTF! Anyway, hopefully, ill return from chester with a game boy colour and one of the pokemons 2moro lol, old skool. Then, with any luck, cricket will be resumed, as the weather isnt lookin 2 good atm, well its dark so i wudnt know, but from the sounds im hearin, its rainin, so therefore i create the visualisation of rain, thus meaning i see it as bleak. Toodles.

Got invited 2 go to London to meet tal 2moro as well, which is kinda random, but nice to be invited along. Then came out this afternoon n played bbit of cricket, which really became poor after a while, lack of effort from everyone due to fatigue. Then 2nite, went in jays n watched his season develop on Smackdown, mazin. He drove to the ring in a truck 2 av a battle with thingy, Kurt Angle. Mazin. Errr, then parked it n game of fooz, n proud of my first run. Picked up the ball, and drew 5 players towards me and jst ran thru them all. One lad, Chezza, gt bit annoyed wen he realised I was better than him n tried a 2 footed tackle on me, realisin wat he did chased bk 2 get the ball n he scissor tackled me; feelin my job wasnt quite done, i stayed on my feet n jst fell on his leg. He soon did one. Then came home, munched away lol, and now Im pissed off, Im nt sure if it was jst me or whether Lu did seem a bit off with me 2nite, i dunno. Well, better go get an ice lolly.

      The day that distance became irrelevant. Sure, Tom's gone to a party, hope he has fun; but if he gets laid, I can forsee the apocalypse lol. S'mornin, went round to jay's rang the doorbell, he answered we walked down his road, n took a left... the rest of the journey 2 the station is a blank now. Got off at ellesmere port, and we were without a hope of getting to Cheshire Oaks without coming across one problem or another. So we walked, and walked... and walked. We walked along the road to the motorway, mini mish. We then entered Stanlow, shit man! It's fucking HUUUUUGE! We walked through stanlow in it's entirity, and jesus it was random, and really far. FINALLY got to Cheshire Oaks, and to be fair, a gud day's shoppin. Jamie and myself made a few useful purchases and did well to manage to carry on walking around the site lol. Then came home n played sum cricket. I bowled both Jamie (poor batting from the lad 2day, or maybe brilliant bowling from me) and Thomas (Face) within one over. C'est magnificent! 2nite, funniest night wev had in a lonnnng time. While Tom was off in Upton, forcin himself to enjoy the party, me n Ben went west and pissed ourselves on multiple occasions whilst jamie played WWE Smackdown: Here Comes the Pain. Sum lovely wrestlin was on show, with jamie cainin sum1, maybe edge in the 6 way thingy, then he lost, OMG! The reaction was sublime.

Then, off 2 Cheshire Oaks I went. I gt an app form for Sainsbury's, and need 2 hand a CV in2 the Nike Factory 2moro. But dillema!!! If i work at Nike, which I want to, it means that it'll clash with my beloved Footy on a Saturday afternoon; which I wudnt give up 4 anythin ever in the world, well maybe one thing... Anyway, returned to the park 2 jay n tom on the floor afta a game of cricket, so when I went in2 bat afta persistently goin at jay with spin bowls, but he kept turnin them away and notchin up the runs, until I finally spun it under his bat n took the... tree to go in2 bat. Presently at 30 not out. 2nite, fuck all, lol. 2moro, Chester with Tom 2 see sum doris that iv never seen n only spoke 2 last nite. So, more on that story 2moro, later

      Sorry 4 late blog x 2, internet bin down n has annoyed me.. Thursday, only thing I can remember is that I finished school, must av bin a shite day. O YEAH! I dissected a mouse in Biology. The worst part was wen it was jst a nomal mous cos it felt harsh cuttin open an innocent lil mouse. Then we gt inside and had no problems, gladly extracted it's Heart, Lungs, Liver, Stomach, Intestines and Kidneys, b4 I cut it's face off, followed by the removal of it's head. Nick then stabbed at the skull in an attempt to find the brain. It was disgusting the noise it made, and we found no brain...   Yesterday, was quite the achievement day. Went out at 11 wiv Jay n tom-tom to look 4 work. Bailed up 2 the croft retail park, n `i successfully handed in 1 CV n gt 2 application forms. Then bailed up 2 the job centre in the ghetto of Bromborough. Got quite a few jobs offered 2 me and I'm hopin 2 work nights at asda, well funny if i do. £5.10 and hour, not bad and ill get £120 odd quid a week. Then after that mission, went home. Last nite, we finally saw the girls again!!! Tal was too quiet 2nite, but we wer wachin friends n big brother so... Rrrr, was mazin 2 see em again, and in mine n jay's post match conclusion, we definately think we shud c them more often, b maaaaazzzzzinnnn!!!! Anyway, I'm gna go get sum breakfast and go to the scarecrow festival. Later.
