          Look in my face, step in my soul, enter into this world of old.  Can you sence the pain? Feel the cold?  Please don't deny me, though I may be the enemy of your prayers. Can't you see that I'm just lonely and scared?   ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~

            A single shed tear, a drop of flesh blood, pierced heart in agonizing pain. When will things ever be the same? Can they even be?  Jaded beauty, faded love, lost comfort; except from above.  Destroyed dreams, desolated hope, shattered faith, non-excisting radiance.  When will all sufferings dissappear? When will I be able to replace my essance into the hands of my earthly guardian?  Will the burning spirit ever relinquish enough to be held again? Will the guardian ever be at peace to embrace it again?  ~*~JadedBeauty~*~

           A splattering of cool, moisture clings to glass. The drum roll of thunder, mixed with the tang of rain. She calls out to me, as if I could hear her voice, trying to chain me there, sheltered from the energy of the storm. Slick trails in the grass, so cold beneath bare feet. Hum of sharp lighting, static in the air. Humidity and heat- long forgotten- outstretched arms embracing crystalline water droplets Hair slicked to scalp,  moist in the torrent of fresh sweet downpour, in cadence with thunder. Embrace cool water, the streams down my back plastering cloth to skin, and continuing its flow. Waterfall of droplets replacing each one spun off, as I circle in the grass, with two more clear beads. Run tongue over lips, tasting cool crispness, of the summer storm, and lightning.  ~*~Essence~*~

           A thousand stars to wish upon but I make no wish but one; to be counted as treasure in your eyes, valued as a jewel, raidiant and rare.  No matter what life takes us throug I'll always be there for you. Waiting for the day that I can place my heart in open hands knowing it will be cared for. ~*~ Jaded Beauty~*~

           I sang a song,  the words lifted to the sky,  I sang you a song,  it was the essence of my life.  I sang a song,  for the moon and for the night,  I sang a song,  and now my life feels right.   ~+~Essence~+~

          Stare out of my lonely soul. wonder if youre lettin go. should i hold onto you heart? when nothings what it seems.  relent -less is never more. wonder what you have in store. can i survive the nezxt step? when we're playin with fire.  (and)if i go- would you stop me? falling down- try to catch me. fading to black- resurect my soul... if youd even know (to look for me beneath you)  pictures taped to a wall. wonder what i just saw. can you ezxplain this to me? outrunning our destiny!  Touchdown calling out your name. wonder is this all a game? did i fall into your trap? or is more still to come.  (And)i dont know what to say. why do i always feel this way? are you pulling my strings? or just pulling me down.  lower and lower mass confusion again. harder and harder the pounding within. how will this all end?  (And) If i go- will you stop me? (I'm) fallin down- can you catch me? trapped in darkness- resurrect my soul. If you even know (to look for me beneath you)  resurrect ressurect  my soul  ~*~Essence~*~

          SCARLET DARKNESS   Pain of a lost child,  a fallen warrior,  over-ran with lies of hatred.  Burning torture to deep to touch.  Blind eyes cast away from reality,  dragged into the realm death.  The realm of scarlet darkness.   Whirlwinds of past despises,  ridicules, tortures, words of poison, actions of blunt amusement.  One by one nightmares recollect  forcing the realm of scarelt darkness to become a reality  entrapped upon minds, emotions, wrists.   I realized something in that world of damnation,  angels do excist.  Two radiant rescuers steadfast by my side.  Visions of love and care; pleading and prayer.  A third bearing hope, understanding,  never ending words of encouragement and care.  Strong arms bears he, to lift me from the red stained void.   Hands wrapped tight enclosed in the arms of the angels,  never wanting to release.  For fear grip is lost the fallen warrior might grow darker.  No light is found upon her soul anymore.  No hope sparkles within her eyes.  Reality has no excistance except within the spirit of others,  of friends and angels.  Only one wish does she cling to,  to escape the world of scarlet darkness  forever.

          Our Lost Innocence  Gowing up too quick too quick... Now seeing a new world without youth's rose colored glasses. Innocent now in so few ways, i support a pyramid of friends, who can lift me high and hang me low. Learning the truth about pain... it comes, it goes, it stays. like scars and memories. Scars caused in love and rage desperation and pain betrayal and forgivness in and on and by friends... on a heart on a soul on a wrist. On one little cut a life changes. On two little drops of blood rests the future. On three minds sits the question and the knowlege of what has been done. And a tears shed, a thoughts read... and some where's an innocence dead. Dead to a world of not knowing. Discovered a truth yesterday... The world's lies are all the same. And the people we love are all that we have in the hard spots and worse... and the truth's covered over paved in little white lies by people who've never seen life, never fear never love never hate never pain... never smelled death waiting just to pull someone in. Saw the reasons today, the reality of my religion, in the voice of an angel. An angel with a towel on her wrist. covering razor blade cuts that i couldnt stop her from making. couldnt. wouldnt. didnt. And saw the truth in the eyes in the hands of a friend... sitting besides an angel. touching soothing praying caring and maybe even saving her life. And then the knowlege, that always stays behind. Driving need to prevent destruction, the destruction, of another innocence... To understand the knowlege of if a god really stops it, and we'll never know if we're that intervention... or another lost innocence facing the truth. And the truth is all lies. And the lies are all reality... and i'm learning about dying each day. Part of the patterns of life the soul's deepest desires... to live to breathe die and love Seeing the beauty and frailty of each child and baby. The frailty of friendships the destruction by time... killing the sweet innocence. the protection from life. And i'm learning the truths, of growing so quick. pain is life. hate is love. betrayal is friendship. and religion is the knowlege that we don't know the answers... when we've seen death. and known our lost innocence.  ~+~Essence~+~

          Alone  My world fell apart today, With tears streaming down my face. And I couldn‚Äôt stand on my own, But I was standing alone. I cried alone.  You promised me you‚Äôd always stand Beside me when I need a hand. Yet I‚Äôm crying to an empty sky, Because today you passed me by.  Am I supposed to trust, Trust the one who‚Äôs turned away? Did you know you ignored, Ignored me on my hardest day? I‚Äôm crying alone.  Calling out your given name, You don‚Äôt come and I can‚Äôt blame. I never should have believed, Should have known you‚Äôd leave.  I don‚Äôt want to believe in my heart, That your promise has broken apart. But for now I‚Äôll suffer on, Trying to stand on my own. I‚Äôll cry alone.  ~+~Essence~+~

            Bottled Tear Drops   Burning heart entrapped inside thorns. Fucked up lies of a so called love, while children lie dead with blood staind blades. Another ounce of the bottled filled, tears held captive inside a fragile cage.  Shattered by abuse, painful words, blunt looks, empty presences. Floods wash away the crimzon sea only to appear pure. Can't you see the ocean is weeping? Are you able to tell when rain is crying, or is it to juvanile to invest love?  ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~

          Good night my blessed ones.  May you rest peacefully in the arms of the Father. The love of God guide you through the night, and awaken you to a new dawn.  The sweetness and care which you have shown to us brings light to our hearts, warmth to our soul, and a thousand smiles upon our faces.  We love you, dear brothers, and all the ways you lead us on, encourage us, strengthen us, and help us to grow.  We are truly blessed to have angels like you, in our lives and within our hearts. And will forever remember your kindness in our prayers.  *this was written for all the guys who went on the winter retreat* ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~

          How Many Times How many times must I sit back and watch as angelic demons rip at your soul? Victom to next, they take turns dragging us into the woods of hell, hidden secrets, erie beauty, captivating danger. Echos of wisdom lost in the web of confused desire. Looks so radiant, smiles so pure, mind so empty, emotions not true. How many times must I watch angels be hurt? Whispers of sweet promises draw thee so far away. Vain attempts to bring angels back, lost in the tangle of a dream. How many times must devils be fought off, only for one to appear after each death? So painful an event, to know my words are crushed by decieving eyes. How many times will they hurt us? How many times will we escape, only to enter another attack? How many times?  ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~

          Sweetest Death   Did you cry when i died  the sweetest death? Amid a waterfall  of crimson droplets? The silvered sharp touch of the blade. Kissing my skin the way you never did. I died the sweetest death, in a burgundy river. White sleeves stained in an older wine's color. It was a quick pain, a wonderful pain. A hurt i didnt share, not even with you. Did you wonder about the smile? That i wore in the sweetest death? I missed the pain more than i ever missed you. Its kiss was a stronger high, that made me so drunk. I died the sweetest death, at the end of my scarlet stained life. Crisp lines cut away my ties and kissed me senseless. I never felt the arrival of my sweet. sweet death. All i could feel was the release you made me dream of for so long.  ~+~Essence~+~

           Thoughts in words, so difficult a concept. Emotions on paper, seemingly impossible.  What cure is there to an over-ran mind in which the web is to intricite to untangle? Thoughts race, time erased, no rescue place, no sweet embrace.  No release for a mind entraped inside thorns of confusion. Who will hear the words, so difficult to utter? Who will ease the pain, to complex to express? A guardian angel... in spirit or flesh. Calls echo to thee, but none respond.  All fall short, empty presences, misled actions, unknown brokenness. There is no rescurer.  ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~

          Screw you and you and you and you All of you who proclaim how much you love. God damned Hypocrites. There‚Äôs an angel crying in hopelessness and need But all you can offer are words. Bloody Liars. Thinking yourselves the saved and holy, And acting so damn proud of yourself. Prove it. Your words are empty of meaning If you don‚Äôt follow what you preach. Waste of Time. That‚Äôs all you are to anyone If you cant get off your lazy ass. Close minded. Open your eyes to your flaws before others, And don‚Äôt you dare condemn them first! Bible thumpers. Wave your fist, raise your voice, But your brimstone is petty and useless. Untrue. See the meaning of His word and live it Or don‚Äôt consider yourself true. Bloody Hypocrites. Screw You.  ~+~Essence~+~

          My wish finally came true in it's entirety. I was able to let go of you.  Though memories of gold flood my mind you're no longer good for me. You bring me pain. I shared my darkest truth with you, and you turned back to your reality, not stopping for a second to reach into mine. I loved you, and a small part of me always will, but I bid you farewell. Welcome to my past, where you'll remain.  ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~

           If I opened up my soul to you, would you read it? If I allowed you to see the truth in my eyes, would you look into them? if a hundred new scars appeared on my wrist, would you seriously care? What am I to you? What do I make you feel.... happy, angry, pained, annoyed, bothered, are you tired of wearing your christian persona? Could you handle my reality? My hate my love my anger my pain. If you knew all of me, the very essence of my being would you still be around?  ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~

          It‚Äôs on the tip of my tongue‚Ä¶ something I have to express‚Ä¶  but just can‚Äôt somehow‚Ä¶ its you‚Ä¶ I had it clearly a brief second ago‚Ä¶  before I wanted to tell you‚Ä¶ but now its gone‚Ä¶ and it felt so important‚Ä¶  a declaration of undying hatred perhaps?  Or maybe it‚Äôs the admission of guilt‚Ä¶  of betrayals‚Ä¶  of eternal ememity?  Just can‚Äôt remember‚Ä¶  just can‚Äôt squeak it out‚Ä¶  Past my thoughts,  and the edge f my mouth‚Ä¶  past you‚Ä¶  Because maybe,  if I say it‚Ä¶ if I admit that‚Äôs the truth‚Ä¶  our whole existence will change‚Ä¶  be altered.  If I find the words,  that have escaped me before‚Ä¶ will you walk away?  Will I know what to do?  Will everything change?  It‚Äôs on the brim of the speakable‚Ä¶  the barely audible whisper of recognition‚Ä¶  Are you ready to hear this?  Am I ready to say this?  It‚Äôs on the tip of my tongue‚Ä¶  but can I say  ‚ÄúI love you?‚Äù

              My eyes cry bloody tears, invisible to most human eyes.  Glimpses only shown never read. The protector of my soul, so close I can feel the kisses of his spirit, yet so far a hundred blood drops go by un-noticed. Smile of radiance, eyes of love, heart not free to give away.  The wonderer ever present, yet blind to open wounds. Tears close to drop on his cheek, skin to numb to notice. A word of care, a prayer of hope, actions of misleading. Twinkling eye, confused heart, emotions at a standstill.  ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~  First half is Andy, who's radiance keeps me alive. Second part is Aaron, who I don't know what to think of yet

           In the endless brief instant  that is a heartbeat  I can see the world.  Because I am not your  or any  ordinary girl.  With a bitterness  i have always possessed  in the depth of my soul  I can sing of gut-wrenching pain and rejection.  That it does  and does not  belong to me is reguardless.  I am silver charms,  hoop earrings  and black shadow.  And yet  or because  I try  you see me in a light  of bangles and sandals and glitter.  But I hate you comparing me  to her and her and her and  who cares what they are saying  who do not know?  Because I am anything but  or as I am just  your everyday young lady  you'll never see the maturity  of what I do or say.  Assuming that  or excluding that  it requires you to see past  the end of your world  to even dare  take a glimpse of mine.  But I am everything  or maybe nothing  to everyone and anyone.  Even as I sing of love and lust  with tears of fear  I am just as  or maybe much less  innocent than that girl  you see me as.  But you're looking for a lap cat,  a soft rain tap,  and a pair of summer sunshine eyes.  How can I ever try to  or want to be  what you ask of me  when in my reality  I am the thunder roll of the rainstorm,  grey touched with turquoise,  and the she tiger ready  and poised.  I'm singing the song  of the dreamer's lucid dreams  and youre climbing the walls  to escape the reality.  For the right price  or more so  the least cost  you can substitute what in me  you've lost  and the packaging's so deceptive.  Take your sun beams,  daydreams  and name brand jeans  and shove 'em.  Because you've destroyed my chance  at every dream  I never had.  Found out this morning  that the world's gonna end when it pleases,  reguardless  or besides  all of your lost thank yous  and pleases.  Because you thought I could be  your cheerleader girl  you've found out or lost  your best girl.  I tried to sing while I dance  and lost a chance at forever  but I have no  or too many  regrets  from my choices.  Can you say any more  or less  about your world-  no you couldn't.  And this is a song about how  you see the world around you  and nothing around  you will be me.  Because whether you like it  or not  I am that letter written in red pen,  the broken rose colored glasses,  and dancing in a summer thunderstorm.  And for all that it passes  or does not pass  by your eyes  I am only ever going to be  one thing  in this song about the world.  A double X mystery.   ~+~Essence~+~

           The stains on hands,  a crimson glow never erased,  reminding you of the pain,  perhaps deadly wounds  inflicted upon those,  not unlike yourself.  In your never ending struggles,  against the rest of your humanity,  you manage to slowly murder  yet one more innocence,  in the name of popularity.  I will not help you pull the trigger  on the weapon of your mouth‚Äôs destruction.  You alone will reap the harvest,  but a dozen others will fall with you,  in an effort to express.  When the next grief stricken mother,  and stunned community come on TV,  will you be there to apologize  for the deaths senseless words,  your words and actions cause?  I will not clean up your bloody mess,  with hands finally clear of guilt,  when luck runs out along with time.  The cost of conformity is the blood  that stains your hands  while you continue to laugh.   ~+~Essence~+~

            Friday night  in her livin room again.  Time once was  she'd wait to hear from them.  The one who set fire  to her sould with his touch,  the one who understood her  needs oh so much.  But pages turn in the night  at quarter til  and in the depths of her heart she  loves both of them still.  theres a few old letters of  polite interest  folded up in the pages of a  notebook on her desk.  A few evening of  fiery caress  before a quick goodbye he  tells her's for the best.  And she remembers every smile just  before she thinks of tears.  but if she ever thought they loved her its  in the long past years.  Shes turning pages in the moonlight night  knowing a piece of her heart  loves both of them still.  Mayvbe someday she'll see his sweet face without  reaching for that spot on her neck.  Maybe one day he'll call her to say that wihtout  her his life was a wreck.  But this friday night when her  friends go out to dance  she'll reach up on that shelf and  read a long romance.  cause in the depths of her heart, oh  she knows it's all over  but in the depths of her heart she  loves both of them still.   ~+~Essence~+~

          A broken heart shatterd upon bladed shards who's name is truth, honesty, reality. Collected in hands that both break and protect withdraw and step forward look away and reach to. Love draws pain respect brings forth tears care crushes dreams. A sparkling eye that kills, hypnotizes, aggrivates, captivates. Kind words influct wounds. Love is hate, hate is pain, pain is truth, truth is freedom, freedom is death, death is beauty. ~*~Jaded Beauty~*~

      So i have a problem...Phil reminds me friday morning in school that i said i'd go see his play he's in...Which just happens to be April 25th, the same day ive been asked to go to a semiformal...Can i clone myself?   And i thought bio classwas boring before...but now we're working with alleles and genetics, and the teach is acting like i'm suddenly her least favorite student, because heaven forbid i help people when they dont understand her version of teaching. So in less than 45 minutes, i got threatened with detention twice for talking...to someone she had neglected to answer the question of, and of course, havent been talking to Rochelle in class, but oops, said one thing to her, and we're informed if either of us are caught talking with eachother, we're getting detention for interupting class and being uncooperative...maybe if she culd stop for 2 seconds, and teach me something i dont already understand id spend less time "interrupting class" and more time listening to her.  I just cant win.

      Heres a quote that makes you stop and think...  "She liked him well enough but her answer to the question 'Could you live without him' was most decidedly 'yes.' If he left tomorrow and she never saw him again, she would miss him, but she'd go right back to her sword practice without a second thought, and her sleep would hardly be plagued by dreams and longing." ~By the sword~  So anyway, back to the land of the living and nonfictional. My freakin mom decided to ground me from the phone for fighting with my sister...the little brat practically got off scott free...is that right? 3rd quarter ends in like a day...not looking forward to report cards...but this means that spring break is getting closer...18 days to go...that'll be nice. Shpping id fun, seeing my cousins(Molly and Emy) is even better...despite getting stuff and my feet killing me yesterday when we got home. Molly's a whole year old, and shes learning to walk!!! its so funny cause she'll be wobbling along, holding your hand, and next thing you know, shes trying to run, so she falls and pops right back up to try again....and Emily's almost 5...so cute and adorable..and she takes such good care of Molly...sharing stuff and helping her stand up again...and they dont treat me like their cousin...more like a young aunt...which i guess is how i treat them too...since Jeannie seems more like my slightly older sister than my aunt...   urlLink My Site

      So war is on the way...I'm so thrilled i could drop myself off a cliff.  I know way too many people in the army/ marines/ navy/ airforce...including my father. i'm not looking forward to this. And Kairsie, love you dearly, but we wont agree on this. Youre looking at it from a strictly pacifistic viewpoint, and i'm being realistic about it...i'm not happy about the upcoming events, but i understand why they are needed.  Finally, Lunch OUTSIDE!!!   So today was mostly debating the pros and cons of current events, most of which i ended up leaving when aurguments got repetative. you can t fight a war when neither side listens to each other...diplomacy just wont work that way...and i'm sorry to those who refduse to give ground, but its necessary.  Yay, my digital camera is working once more!!! i may finally be able to get pictures up on my site, which will be incredibly nice.so yeah...the world as we all know it is changine, its rearanging...  IRISH BLESSING May the road rise up to meet you, May the wind be always at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face May the rains fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, may god hold you in the palm of his hand.  May our children and their descendents be the ones to find a lasting peace, May their hopes and dreams become united, May the past be left for those who hate. And until we meet again, may love and trust find a way to make a stand. May this world and all its wonders be home to all humanity, May the people find a common purpose, May we help one another to survive, And until we meet again may Mother Earth pour her heart into our hands.

      Happy Saint Patricks Day! did i mention i'm part Irish?  So the thesis got handed in, the weathers fantastic, getting my voice back, though my throats still sore, and the cafeteria staff has discovered how to kill lime jello. what next? and no matter what Kairsie says, Claires is not evil...just picky. hmm...i could use a job too...ah well. Great weekend..could have been better...but you know how that goes...now about that permit...look out roads, here i come...well...in a week or so.  I got @nd honorable mention in the Young Poets Contest this year!!! granted, i got #rd place last year...but what can i say? i wrote a poem not as interesting to those poor old men and lady judges. then again...people in their 60s and 70s...poem titled Kiss of Death...yeah...no wonder. ah well, i know it kicked ass, even if they dont think so ~_~

But with all this stress, and stuff going on in my mind/life, i dont know myself at the moment, let alone how i could try and understand someone else...But he took it better than i thought he would...much much better.   So now i just need to finish that stupid business letter, my portrait for art, and manage to get all my other homework done. Yip-pee.I'm thrilled to peices. SCHOOL SUX and i have 6 more weeks of it. Damn it, i want SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Oh yeah, and Godparents got back from their vaK to Florida, they brpought me this ver ver cool bright blue, micky mouse, bitike sarong. THANKS MUCH!!!!

      Speaking of the devil, look who just walked in. he knows just where to find me. here we go again. i can tell hes gonna ask me to dance, but thats not as far as he wants to go. i need ten thousand angels to help me tell him no. Lead me not into temptation, heaven help me to be strong. I can fight all that i'm feeling, but i cant do it alone. Help me break this spell that i'm i'm under, guide my feet and hold me tight. I need ten thousand angels, watching over me tonight. Time to face my weakness, and look him in the eyes. Lord knows it wont be easy but i just gotta try. i cant let myself get lost in his arms, that's how i got my heart lost before. i need ten thousand angels to walk me out the door.Lead me not into temptation, heaven help me to be strong. I can fight all that i'm feeling, but i cant do it alone. Help me break this spell that i'm under, guide my feet and hold me tight. I need ten thousand angels, watching over me tonight.   I love that song...and its so true... so anywayz, other than comparing martina mcbride's music to my life...i'm bored!!!! i'm exhausted as all hell, dont feel like doing any studying(i have a literature test 1st period) or doing homework...i dont feel like drawing, and i dont feel like painting, or even writing...i dont even feel like eating, even though my stomaches been growling since 3rd period, and i had fries at lunch...not that it helped much. I'm a mess, and welcome to my world.  On the bright side of things, i signed up for the Edgar allen poe trip in november, and made a bid for art editor of the LAM at school(next year of course) kim's doing a good job this year, so it should be fun...As for those of you who actually live near me, Pajama game, friday night, 7 30...be there!!! we need to watch phil!!! I'll be there, since it looks good, and Keri's going to watch Tony...we all know why!!!  I think ive upset Kairsie...or at least cause a stir...enough that she put my question in her blog...so now i'm putting some in here that she cant answer very easily...  1)Did Noah have woodpeckers on the ark? If he did, where did he keep them?  2)How come you pay an extra 25 cents to get something put on your hamburger but they don't take off the price if you get something taken off?  3)Why do they call the small candy bars the "fun sizes"? Wouldn't be more fun to eat a big one?  4)364 days of the year, parents tell their kids not to take candy from  strangers, yet on Halloween, its encouraged! Why is that ?   5)Since there is a rule that states "i" before "e" except after "c", wouldn't "science" be spelled wrong?  6)What did cured ham actually have?  7)Are children who use sign language allowed to talk with their mouth full?  8)If a criminal turns himself in shouldn't he get the reward money?   9)Why is it that people say they "slept like a baby" when babies wake up like every two hours?  10)What would happen if: Everyone was to flush their toilet at the same time?  11)Is an alcoholic just a drunk that's scared of a hangover?  12)If our planet is inhabited with creatures made by God...is it possible that there's another planet inhabited with creatures made by the Devil?  13)If you don't pay your exorcist, do you get repossessed?  14)Is there anything easier done than said?  15)If money is the root of all evil then how come churches ask for it?   16)If ignorance is bliss, why arent more people happy?  17)Why does the label on childrenôs Tylenol tell you not to operate heavy machinery or vehicles when it's for CHILDREN!?  18)When you put 'THE' and 'IRS' together, it forms 'THEIRS'. Coincidence? I think not  19)If all the nations in the world are in debt, where did all the money go?  20)What do you say when someone says you're in denial, but you're not?  21)How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?  22)If an anarchist group attained political power, would they by principle have to dissolve their own government?  23)If an ambulance is on its way to save someone, and it runs someone over, does it stop to help them?  24)If you decide that you're indecisive, which one are you?  25)If love is blind, how can we believe in love at first sight?  And yes, beleieve it or not, i have another couple hundred of these things...but i only put my favorites up...yawnn...i need a nap, but dad's bringing home chinese tonight.

      darn my sisters for blowing fuses...i was gonna beat daniel finally at that game yesterday!  so yeah, club worship was great...well..except the part where it was colder inside than out...and the part where we couldnt identify the meat in our chinese...and the part where krystal had to have a lil talk with dennis...and the part where we were all moping about outside...so maybe it wasnt awsome, but it was fun. Dont worry Kairsie, he'll grow up one day. And well...not looking forward to talkin to dave, but i have to if i dont want to do the ultimate, so i guess this weekend or whenever will be stressful for me.  pick up my deck tuesday afternoon, babysit my sis all week...joy of joys i'm thrilled to death

      two words, SPRING BREAK!!!!!!!!!  So i'm out of school until the tuesday after easter...yay!!! Tuesday-gotta remember to hit ravens mere, my deck's in FINALLY, and yes, keri, we can figure it all out then...movies tomorrow night...i think we've decided on the new chris rock movie...we'll see i guess...yawn...maybe i'll be able to catch up on sleep now...that'd be nice. And maybe hang out with the gang, or those who are still in state/counrty this week...  And questions about abortion people should ask themselves, if theyre "pro-life"  1) are you pro life, or pro human life? 2) is it better to terminate a fetis comapred to killing or having an infant die? 3) are you going to adopt all those unwanted children, who are here becuase abortion wasnt used? 4) What the hell does it matter if another woman gets an abortion? Its her body. 5) are you against abortion, or against people being unaware of prossible health risks involved?  "What makes you think you can trust me with a baby if you cant even trust me with a choice?" ~Bumper Sticker

And heaven and hell forbid i point out her error to her, in defence of them, since i was there the whole time...AND SHE THREATENED TO KICK ME OUT OF CLASS!! grr...that woman is severly pushing the boundaries of her already stressed luck.  So hmm...i get to bring home my acrylics portrait friday...since we're only workin in class til then...its so much fun, i luv painting or at least for this.And the blending is cool...i started on skin tones today...its lookin okay. maybe i'll finish sometime this year...i'm actually farther along than the others..except for like..mary and jess. ah well...cant wait til friday..and saturday with the movie and youth group of course.

      grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  new cell phone cover, new day, new book, new annoyance...i 'm stressed, who are you? But so yeah...i didnt get to go for my permit (my fault alone) causei havent studied enough yet...and its funny...i swear theres more paint on me than the canvas. but i have about 1/3 done, tomorrow, after church, i'm gonna paint in the other 2 faeries, and then the cobwebs. we'll see how it goes from there. Pray that my godparents can watch my sister, so i can go to youth group....  do have any idea how it feels to like a) seriously like someone b)know they like you but nothings going to happen there c) listen to other's love lifes if they can be called that and d)have promised yourself youre not gonna even consider dating till schools out? And people keep telling me that its so easy not to date, and so on...and yeah, i know...i didnt date for 3 1/2 years of offers...and its was easy...but then...i dont know, things are so confusing, and the world's just too complex to make any sense to me right now. in fact...its always too big for me to comprehend. . .  i know i want to go to college...i want the car, the job, the house, and all that...i want my parents to be proud of me, and eventually to be able to give my children the things they havent been able to give to me...i know that i want to keep in touch with all my friends, as they graduate...and i know that i want to stay an active member of my church...but after all that...its so easy to think about the things like that, but getting to them is so much different...  i seriously cant wait til schools out...and i dont have to face school...and all of these questions can be put aside to wait their turn...and i'll be able to to concentrate on things other than homework, and guys and tests and finals...

      You see I can not be Forsaken because i'm not the only one...  I've been thinking about religion a LOT lately...granted, its one of those topics thats constantly in the back of my mine, waiting to emerge when i have a free moment...i'm obssessed with the variety in the subject...and how its all interconnected at the center of it all... and while i cant say its a bad thing to believe strongly about your particular belief's practices...i cant find it in myself to condone holy wars, crusades, and jihad for any reason. I'm still firmly of the belief that all faiths are actually the same one in different forms.

      I love the Queen of the Damned soundtrack!!!!  Here's my lil sales pitch, if you like heavy music, like disturbed, korn, papa roach, or kidney thieves, get ahold of the CD. Jonathan Davis cowrote the music, and its incredible. I dont normally go for this style, and i love it even more than the movie...hehehe, so anywayz.  Saturday was nice...i slept in til around 10, and found out that Ashley and Jason couldnt go to the movies with me, and Dennis. Note, this is just before i'm getting ready to leave, and i ended up getting there JUST as the movie started. But yeah, Xmen 2 was great, despite Samantha's misinterpretation of Jean's sacrifice. But what do you expectfrom someone who's never read any of the comics? So after figuering out from what dad's said about the original storyline, it made sense apart from a merge of charchters. but anywayz it was a good movie. And the trip to the mall afterwards was most rewarding. Ashley and i shipped Jay and Dennis off, and went in search of the illusive swimsuit. Which we found. In fact, Steph and Christine bumped into us around then, and we also found my hat, and ashley's prom jewelry. It was funny, when we tried to call the guys, who had ashley's cell with them, they didnt answer, and they had just figured out how to answer our text message when me and christine found them. Always funny. So yeah, it was fun hanging out together, until the mall closed and we had to wait for Dad to pick us all up.   So yeah, Missed youth group last night, since dad got ticked off and decided to stay home from the trip to my grandmothers.  Bright side is that i started studying big time for my permit today, and got to see Molly and Emily last night. They're getting so big, and Molly's talking a little bit!!! Yawn.....i have to finish my term project still...that could take a few  weeks  and as for my poetry...i have so little inspiration lately...i'm rhyming, something i seldom do, and its all emotional, mushy stuff that so not like me...and even the other LL members have noticed it.

      OMG  I never thought i would say this, but i am so unbeleivably happy to have rochelle as a friend. Wiht everyone trying to talk to me and have me help them at once, during biology...i couldnt take it...i came so close to just beaking...and rochelle...she was just like...leave her alone NOW...and i really needed that right then...and its just soo much dtress...but not all from one source. its helping my friends with their problems, school work, class, church, my mom, my sister, dating, friends, life....but most of it is too many activities, not letting me concetrate on the other stuff, and not letting me breath, and think about life...I'm going to have to drop some of it, i know that now...art club's gonna go...so's library club...and as much as i never thought it would, girl scouts is going to have to go...so maybe i dont go to england in 2 years...but its sure as heck better than some of my other alternatives right now. ..  and...yeah...i just need to unwind, and sleeping in tomorrow morning sounds great...but i have to get laundry done, and clean part of the bathroom...who knows anymore...maybe i'll just sleep til 2 30, and get up in time to get ready for the movie with my friends.

      eeeeek  physical today...but the bright side is i'll be able to go for my permit this weekend...(double eeek) but downside is i have a sore throat yet again...and  my wrist is killing me...ibuprofin is my friend...and i have to figure out what the loading issue is with the website...it obviously isnt the amount of stuff on pages, as a couple of pages without mega quantities of memory are having trouble...hmm...guess i'll have to check and figure it out...  X2 saturday...so far looks like it'll be Phil, Me, Dennis, Keri, and Tione...but we'll see.

      Did you ever notice that the people who stereotype are the ones who coplain about it the most?  So i was talking with friends friday, and it reminded me about something that happened at Club Worship last saturday...Now everyone KNOWS we arent supposed to judge on appearances alone. But people do and did.  The people who take the trouble to know me are aware that i'm a christian...and most of my closer friends know i've been one my entire life, to the point where i decided to be rebaptised when i was 12. And those same people could tell you i only JUST started wearing the silver pentacle pendant i have. A friend of mine, Ashley, also wears one. We decided to see how many people would comment to us about them, and wore them to Club Worship...for the first time ever.(i normally wear my cross) but anywayz, no one actually said anything TO us, but at least one group of girls was talking ABOUT us. And Ashley and her boyfriend were near them at the time...as they discussed how we  "Need to abandon our evil pagan ways," and how "i've been coming here so often, and i still havent been saved." Amusing what a peice of misunderstood jewelry causes, isnt it?   (little FYI: the pentacle with its 5 points and circle stands for the unity of the 4 cardinal elements and the spirit. a symbol of unity and peace. hardly evil now, isnt it?)  so yeah, countin down til the 12th...26 days i beleive...cant get outta school quick enough. reminder to self, hitting dorney with ashley and jay instead of w/school...gotta remember the money for her by fri. yawn...i'm so out of it today...i actually didnt MIND going to the dentist...tells you how tired i am. then again, with that rope torture yesterday i was ready to crash when i got home...actually i'm stil ready to crash...yawn...

      TGIF  and i dont mean thank god i'm female...although i do. The week is finally over, and i cant help but be relieved, even though this afternoon has been getting progressively worse...sigh...granted...i'm probably worked up over nothing, but at the moment my life sux, and thats all i can really concentrate on...even though a crap load of things happened today..and Caity and Joel have been huge helps to me...exspecially joel's advice, however humorous it is at the same time...and i just need to think...and pray to God above that i'm wrong...because right now i dont think i can handle being right... I just ...things are so confusing and i dont do well with uneasing problems...and...i dont know...i just need sleep, and some time to think things over in life...however..school takes priority ...no matter hwt i want to say. Oh well.

      yawnnnn  how long until school is over? oh yeah...thats right...ALMOST A MONTH!!!! grr, i cant take this torture much longer...But the art show's fantastic, and all that. i'm uploading pictures onto my website, of some of the best peices. but yeah...i'm soo exhaustedby life...And my essentials od drawing teacher thought dave was like 15 when he met him, and then was shocked when dave mentioned finishing college for the semester. That was hilarious. And now Kairsie's bugging me about my reasons for going out with dave instead of Dennis in the first place and all that goes along with that particular decision and its resurfacing... Keri's ready to kill tony, because he refuses to talk to her, and he doesnt seem to care. she tries to be so patient with him, but hes such a boy...he doesnt get it that he needs to talk to her. Aye, dont have to go through that right now, thank God. I mean, kerilyn was crying on the walk to my house, shes that upset over it. Art term project to get started on, i forgot to go to palcho's room, with keri's emotional state after school...crap, now i have to talk during class and waste more time...what a waste. not on keri mind you, but spending class time going over streching canvas, when i could be actually skecthing on the canvas...grrrr. i gotta go...person i wanted to talk to isnt logging on, and i've gotta babysit my godbrother and sister...yawn...just what i need...less sleep.

      Beware a curious kitty with a digital camera!!!!!!  otherwise known as duck and run, i have almost unlimited memory. so yeah...i'm multitasking here...uploading pictures onto my computer, and typing...but oh well, its worth it. So Saturday night was Club Worship, which was great...as always. Agley and Jason enjoyed it oo, which is always a good thing, as they'll probably be joining us again next month. kairsie was all happy in her candy kid glory after getting her birthday present from me and ashley...youre welcome!!! Got dennis to talk about his problems, not an easy feet..literally, after walking around the block 3 times barefoot, i was ready to get back to work.   For some reason, people keep buggin me about dating...People, my main reason for not right now is too much stress!!! get back to me in 31 days, when schools out for the summer, and i have time to breath let alone reevaluate my life. My mom announced to me this morning that she doesnt care what it takes to move anymore...including leaving my school and friends far behind...and my reminder that we're in the county's top school, and that by the time we move, i'll be getting ready to start my senior year went completely in one ear and out the other...Shes such a @!%$ when it comes to what i want...yet heaven forbid it conflict with her life...GRR!!!! I'm not kidding when i told her i'd move in with my grandparents before moving out of our school district, and i doubt Grandmom and GrandDaddy will be upset by it...Grandmom already hates my mom, and this would be icing on her cake.   Art show starts tomorrow, Wyo JR SR High, in the old gym, from 6-9 for anyone interested in showing up...Tues, Wed, and Thurs...But i'm gonna be there on Wed...its cool. We had to carry artwork down 3rd period, during my art major class. Those ceremics peices are HEAVY!!! And i wrote a poem for my sister 7th period, during review...but i forgot to get it out of my notebook, so i'll have to wait to add it to my poems section...oh well...so much to think about...  ~"Tomorrow...the only day in the year that appeals to a lazy man." ~Jimmy Lyons ~"The most utterly lost in all days is that in which you have not laughed." ~"Adam must have an Eve to blame for his faults." ~Old Italian proverb ~"Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall."  ~Shakespeare ~"Don't be afraid your life will end; be afraid that it will never begin." ~Grace Hansen

      Filming a commercial with your friends= PRICELESS   for everything else, theres mastercard  Lol, so yeah, helped SIMZ out with the tech commercial for mastercard...could be interestin...exspecially considering i dislike tube tops without shirts overtop...and i had to take off my t-shirt...but its pretty cool..."plot line" is a few of people going to the "SimZ Show", which would be Frosty pimpin it up with me and ashley...scott's the usher/member of the crowd...ahlye's also a member of the crowd, as am i, ryan, steph, frosty, and pat...Simz is the guitarist, and duncan played camera man/crowd member...it was interestin...can you say no script? and evthing only done once? yawn....38 total days til i get out of school...that is way too long. i want out now. and i have to update my website...could take some time. yawn...dennis was grilling me about the way i was joikng around with daniel online...  what was with Dan and you on IM, I was about to blow chunks today?  yes  why? do you two talk like that all the time? we're just kidding around...or at least i am Yuch! I wouldn't even goof around like that we flirt all the time, but we all know we're kidding around, so its cool that's good, I guess, though if you hadn't noticed already, I don't joke around like that, mainly so no one gets the wrong idea  no offense, but what does this all matter to him? if he doesnt like me like everyone swears he doesnt, it shouldnt matter...and i dont like daniel, ev1 knows that...and kairsie doesnt want to add more to my load, so she wont tell me whats wrong...so i have to wait til shes ready, and feel guilty about it...things are so messed up.

      YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWN  still feel horrible, but thats to be expected. Finished going through about...30 back pages of posts for one persons work...needless to say this could take a long time. Ive done it before, not hard, just prolonged and meticulous. and well worth it. cant wait til the school's art show...May 13th, 14th, and 15th!!!! Hopefully people actually comethis year. i have stuff in it that i actually like...yippeee.   I wish Krystal and Dennis could get that whole issue figured out...i realise she doesnt see him that way anymore, and hes still hung up...but constant cold shoulds and flippin out on eachother causes and solves nothing...and my hearts going out for Phil right now...poor hermano is sitting there telling me he doesnt have any feelings for krystal anymore...he swears hes over her...then he gets that LOOK on his face whenever i mention her name...I talked to him about it Sunday...he was denying it again, until i pulled the "this is your big sis talking" routine...his tune became "okay, i dont like her consiously...but SUBconsiously i still like her a lot..."  right hun, you look at it that way, and try not to get hurt... i'm already the worlds shoulder to cry on...Kairsie, Krystal, ROCHELLE, caroline, dennis...granted, i normally do offer, and i'm not upset about doing it...i like being there for my friends...but it tends to wear a person down...exspecially when i cant tell people everything on my mind, because they have enough problems to get through, and work out on their own, without me adding my problems and life meladrama to the mix...Some one needs to be there for samantha, and chelsey and simz...i seem to be that person...and its a good way for me to understand people, but i cant let anything slip that might make things worse... And stress...schools so pschitzo right now...tests, reports, parents, projects, friends, yg, church, guys, my self...my mind is a mess...just when i think ive figured it out, evthings fine, can take a breather...wam, emotional, or mental breakdown/overload...cant handle a one on one relationship even...thoughts out of order, i mean...i could have sworn when i mentioned something to dennis the other day he said he didnt want to talk about it online because of relationships, and it had to be a face to face thing...but where did that even come from? i dont remember mentioning relationships at all...that boy is just...yeah. guys, so confusing, can t figure them out...then again...do i really want to?  cough cough, ahem...TYLENOL SUX...thank you.

      Cough Cough weeze, sneeze, what a great life i lead...  or am subjected too. Asthma sux, and being lightheaded, chilled, and allergic to the world is even worse. But on the bright side...I FINISHED MY ASRT PROJECT!!!!!! i'm happy...well, actually one of the noses is slightly off still...but Mrs Palcho is going to help me adjust it so that it looks right...and i'm slowly but surely "spring cleaning" Literate License...I figure if the clubs gonna be dead, i can at least clean the place up a bit...noones gonna bother to notice anywayz...yawn...more later...

      D&D kicks ass....  so during the assembly today, with the motivational speaker, me and Phil were discussing who all would most likely be in the campaign...The list so far is Dennis, Daniel, Dave, my dad acting as DM(elves beware...) Phil, and myself...so now we're in the process of trying to figure another girl who'd like to join the group, because can you imagine them if i have a high charisma female character, and i'm the only one? eek! on the bright side...dad'd dungeon realm views elves as slaves...so that'd be a great disguise for my thief...but thats about the only party advantage. Stress, eek!  Yawn...back to school today, not cool...veggin at the moment, but tomorrow i'll be painting all day. joy of joys.

      Suburns going away...  which is a good thing, considering i have a car wash outside on saturday that'll fry me again...oh the joys of being a redhead...on the bright side of things, my hair is completely finished being braided(i like it) and Now my parents owe me $200, well...$172...if you factor in my cell phone bill that mom needs to pay.   For anyone who was in my group at the pool on thursday...when do you want to do that again? LOL, seriously though, it was a lt of fun, despite people getting sunburnt, and chlorine in their eyes...and the occasional scrape against the abrasive pool bottom. Lemme think...who all was there...Kairsie, my bratty sisters, Simz, Joelle, Dennis, Daniel, Lisa, Sarah, Emily, and Jeremy...Well, and me too, but duh. It was interesting though...Volleyball, diving boards, boys vrs girls, dunking/ flipping, food, and a pool...all good. But yeah, so now we have to decide when in July we all want to do that again...and then maybe again in August, before we all get thrown back in school. Who knows...  As for the D&D campaign...My dad's reviweing the dungeon/world to make sure everything is workable for a game, and i NEED to know when people are free to get together and fine tune charachters. Keep trying to find out, and people change topics...grrr, dont expect me to give an offical game date when people still dont even have freaking CCs made yet...Note, this applies to Kairsie, Ashley, Dave, Dennis, Phil, and Daniel...and possibly Jesse, i dont know if he's still interested or able to join the group...yawn...and of course, 1 or 2 people could/can possibly join the group still...just itd be hard to run if we have more than eight...but yeah...And i need to find out fro ashley if we decided we were using her house for the campaign, or whether we're still deciding...anywayz  I thought my friday night was good...Last night ended up being just as good if not better...~_~ some people may know why....i'm not getting into detail here other than he asked me out. Enough said, the main people all know what that means...Oh, and Kairsie has informed me that if i break his heart, i will be given THE Speech, and all for a week...like i would even want to? Geez people...am i that big of a heartbreaker? 1 doesnt really make much of a pattern...But does this really matter at the moment? I think not.   Oh, and that reminds me...i need to make sure RB's picture gets up on my website...apparently its not up already...even though i thought it was...ohwell, must make that correction before sunday, or she'll beat me.  *****I HATE MY SISTERS*****THANK YOU*****

      now i remember why i hate my sisters...  they never shut up! they fight with eachother constantly, they dont take no for an answer, and eek...get me out of this house!!! Sara's pissed off at me because i told her i wouldnt take her to the pool, then she threatened to go on her own...which meant i told her if she kept the attitude up she wasnt going tomorrow either...but Frances has been doing pretty good...so i might take her to the pool once dad gets home...  yawn...those 2 wear me out...but at least my scratches and cuts from last monday are almost gone...and YG sunday was ver amusng...yeah...expesiaclly afterwards...yawn...going to take a nap...and maybe hit that pool...friends welcome!

      wow, over a week since i was here last...  School's out until august 25th...not looking forward to that, but in the meantimes, i get to make a lil money, and hopefully get that bloody permit...no scare intended. My family is now the proud owners of a 4' X 3' painting, and a house without any available wall space to put it in...Guess whats in my living room? Not to mention the various pots, sculptures, and drawings i made over the course of the term...Apartments, and art dont mix.   life is so unfair...i've been to the pool 1(once) since the begining of the summer...other than pool day, but that doesnt count because they'd just filled the pool over at west reading, and of course it wsnt swimmable yet, but anywayz back to the problem at hand. Its always raining and i cant get out of the house to go to the pool, and its gonna drive me insane before july even gets here...And dont even get me started on the demon spawn my parents call my sisters...Those two are the devil incarnate...one is corrupting the lil one with her issues and so forth, and the lil one...well lets just say this, if my children behave anything like my sisters, they are all up for adoption.!!!!  I've made some updates on the picture gallery of my website, the senior talent show from this year's done, as is the pool day(all images uploaded) page...i dont think i could have gotten much more on there...wait, i lie...i could have, if i shrunk all graphics...but yeah, if anyone wants to see larger copies of images, let me know...i'll more than likely have them...and if i dont, i can make um bigger...well...hoepfully...yawn.....i think i'm going to finish unzipping my newest sim aquisitions, and load them into game data...

      i so tired....  finals started this morning...eeeeeeek, so much stress, but at least i get to sleep in, and get out early. and dont get me started on guys at the moment. people keep talking to me about that topic, and bugging me about dennis...aye!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! so anywayz...dont talk to me about that until at least thursday afternoon. yeaaah.  so yeah, i want to go to the pool...waaaaaah...but its not warm enough yet, and we dont have our member ship, and yippeee skippy club worships on saturday so thats my end of year celebration time. yawwwwwwn...i should have woken up earlier, then i wouldnt be so darn tired njow, but ashley's over, and we're harrassing people online and watching queen of the damned...classic movie, a must watch. so yeah...  And just a few little thought provoking quotes from the Qur'an and other ancient types "Tell (the Jews and Christians) we believe in the Revelation, which has come down to us (the Qur'an) and in that which came down to you (the Taneach and Gospel); Our God and your God is one, and its to Him we surrender." Qur'an 29:46  "Shun those studies in which the work that results dies with with the worker" Leonardo da Vinci  "Tell them, 'Call on 'God' or call on 'the Compassionate' by whatever name you call upon Him (it is well), for to Him belong the Most Beautiful Names'" Qur'an 17:109  "There is no god other than God." translated in arabic~ "La ilaha ill Allah."

      I am no longer Chippy!!!!!!  my tooth got fixed today(the front one) and i had to fillings redone...minus novacane cause i'm afraid of shots. but its all good now...if you didnt know it was chipped before, you wouldnt be able to tell it wasnt my original state of tooth.  It only took 11 months to get it fixed...parents, ughh!  the world is due wednesday...well...everything but the world. That forsaken art term project, my Literature Cornell box w/essay, the Churros for World cultures...you get the idea...On the bright side of things, the amount of work left on my painting is minimal, and i founf the recipe already..so its just a matter of Keri coming over to work on our cooking...now that box...i 'spose i'll have to round up the contents of that bloody box tonight, and write the paper tomorrow, after i'm done cooking. I hate having to be organized like this...

      "Shun those studies in which the work that results dies with the worker." ~Leonardo da Vinci  Youth Musical and Godspell tomorrow afternoon... i'll be gone until saturday afternoon...  Lord give me strength, spirit guide me... i'd add lady watch me, but instead, since that would have certain people screaming witch at me, i'll edit it to Father protect me. Why is it that words mean everything to some people, and nothing at the same time? And why in the world are people presuring me in my faith, when the only person in Heaven or Earth that i need to prove my devotion to is God himself... And people do argue  my  faithfulness... the bible tells us that those who practice in private are more likely to go to heaven than those who display their devotion in public, for the world to see their faith... and at the same time, proclaiming undying devotion for God means nothing, if we dont display our devotion in our lifestyles... anyone seeing a quandry? At the mall last night, with Simz and Frosty, somehow the subject of being saved came up... and the only idea at the time that came up, was the "follow the leader" metaphor... and honestly, i'm not certain, if Jesus jumped off a cliff, with me to follow, that i could... or would... i know i'm supposed to put my faith in him, and he'll protect me from falling... but the reality of it... isnt as strong.  but anywayz... i've been reading up on various religions, as usual, thanks to Mrs Stephen, and 4rth grade English... and i've found a a couple more fabulously similar creation myths... and di you realize, that around the time that the irealites were taken to babylon, their traditions and practices changed? There's a comment in one of my favorite books along the lines of when you're surrounded by believers, you cant help but start to beleive, and when youre surrounded by nothing but non-beleivers, you begin to lose faith... which would make sense as to why their culture suffered changes at that time...   Keep going back to that topic... now i dont remember what i wanted to type originally when i logged on here. So i guess i'll just keep going with this flow for awhile, since its pretty much my thoughts lately... maybe thats why i've been rereading Armogedden Summer for like the 30th time... The library near my house had a copy, so i figured what the heck, i'd take it out and read it again... Heaven knows the copy at school needs a break from me borrowing it constantly... I seriously suggest it... Jane Yolen and Bruce Coville co-wrote it, and the two co-narrarators, Marina and Jed, are such opposites, and at the same time are so much alike.... its great... Now granted, the whole theory of having the world as you know it end on your birthday is very frightening... if you beleive in it, or want to... and if youre trying not to get pulled in by what are in your opinion, religious nutcases... but youre stuck with them for 2 weeks... Just read the book, kay, its really good, and Ashley backs me up on this...  I havent been able to write for the last week... or at least not poetry. My stories are all-mostly moving along, but i cant concentrate on my poetry and songwriting... But i have camp tomorrow, and i'll be taking a sketchbook and notepad along... so maybe i'll be able to get reinspired, like i do every year... Swatara's good for that at least, and for helping me work out my faith... even with the debates and such... And i miss everyone so much! but Erika and Laura W wont be there... nor will Seth... havent seen him since his art show last year... But Heather, Gina, Kim, Chris, Brad, Phil, Rachel, Chrissie, and the others will be there... and Laura B 's back from France now... so i'll hopefully get to talk to her about that... Fingers crossed that Dustin, Jake, Steve, Emily, and some of the others will be there... jake and Steve almost definately will be... they were so mad they had to miss it because of NYC last summer... and who can blame them? Too bad Kimo, Amy, Caity, Darrel, and Sarah wont be old enough until next year... and i might not be going next year... My godparents always pay for my camps, and they want to do a different christmas present this year... sigh... I'm gonna go clean and swap laundry... my sister comes home tonight, and i leave tomorrow... to save a lot of technicallity troubles, and harrassment, Trinity watch you all!!! and my cell phones staying behind, so dont call me...but youre welcome to ask Dennis or Deanna for the address!   *************** Close your lips, Canít close your mind, Make me listen all the time. But when my turn finally comes, Suddenly youíre deaf and dumbÖ  Try to follow the logic,  Of the way this should work. Listen to the grown-ups, But stay mute, no talking, Too young to know anythingÖ  (Pre Chorus) Chained into a church mouse, My beliefs on the blade of a knife.  (Chorus) Get a grip, get a life, Playing the mind games of life, On the edge, of a blade, of a knife. And you wonder why Iím rebelling, When Iíve got all these thoughts, But nobodyís listeningÖ  Iím supposed to be The next ruling crowd, But here I stare at the floor, Eyes down, hands clenched, Mind bent on breaking freeÖ  They tell me to live free, Clipping my wings for eternityÖ  Never question the status quo, Flow the way your elders flow. Be mature but be still meek. Only clichÈs may I speak, The lies the world would keepÖ  Pre Chorus  Chorus 2X  Balance on the blade of a knifeÖ When Iíve got these thoughts, But nobodyís listeningÖ  Nobody ever listensÖ

      Hmmm, how to recount my weekend...   Friday : First off, mom's installing parental spyware crap on the computer, to torure me (annoying over protective maternal freak) which means i wont be online nearly as much, or as long... and it'll be regulated by her... why cant she trust me? and its not like she doesnt already control my websites etc... noooooo she wants to be able to control where i go, how long i go, and to track exactly what i do there!!!! i crave PRIVACY and TRUST But anywayz, feeling better, so i went to steph's sleepover/party... WOW not the best party in the world...but ver...interesting... We were doing all right, but then Daniel's not quite used to how Christine, Rochelle, and Samantha act when all 3 are together... and who can blame him for being uncomfortable with it? So anywayz, Kairsie and him stayed outside for a while, and then when kairsie went over to the studio that last time, he stayed there, with her... and then there was the incident with the phone call, resulting in mass confusuion in the Eager family, and see Jon's blog for "details" because i have more to type, and limited time to type it in... So anywayz, After we kicked out the last of the boyz, somewhere around midnight, we watched Darkness falls, the movie about the cursed toothfairy who's killing people who look at her... you know the one. On a scale of one to ten, i'd say its a 7... eh, not bad, not good. Now, when we finished that, we were watching The Ring, which i recomend to people...not so much scary as startling, and intense... you get sooo drawn into it, despite trying not to... trust me on this. Anywayz, it was sooo much better than darkness falls, and ashley called the phone, using her cell, when the phone rang in the movie, scaring the crap out of everyone there... it was great. Ashley never did succeed in getting more people to want to watch animatrix...which i did want to watch, but i'll have to do with a couple of minutes of it... darn.  so anywayz...then Rochell and Gigi wouldnt shut the hell up...and i'm talking at 6, 7 in the morning....you get the idea.  Saturday : Somewhere around 7 30 i fell asleep...after one threatened ducktaping, and 2 attempted ducktapings( note i was using a sleeping bag) anywayz... up then around 9, 9 15... if youre good at math(or not) you realize that equals about 1 1/2 hours of shut eye... which turned out to be an issue after 6, 7 at night... had to dig up my house(and VF) trying to find a one peice, as mine has miraculously disapeered... but fortunately, my mom's black one fits almost perfectly...even if the back's a lil lowcut for my personal taste. But so yeah, after a bit of a mixup, and stress, kairsie, Steph and I went to Jesse's party (who's up for the 30th?) which was fun, even with sleep loss.But yeah... and i learned how to play pit... which was fun...~_~  Sunday : Yawn... i almost slept through sunday school... but not quite. But it wouldnt have mattered anywayz, since Pat and Hal took Kaity, Steffy, Phil, and Jamie on a camping trip... and Matt and Sierra werent there either... Sarah and Jason showed up late... so my sunday school class was me!!!! yippeee! and then , when i got home, it was sleep, eat, and read... and get a looksy at the graphics tablet my parents bought me, with my money, at the computer show... Its 8 X 6, and i luv it!!!!! cant wait for mom to stop screwing around with my pc so i can CG. and then dad drove me to Esh's meadow, for YG... which was really nice...even without the Philly group. Jeff decided to greet my dad, when he came to pick me up, and they talked for at least 10 minutes, while Dennis and i wondered why they didnt turn off the truck at least... parents, aye. but anywayz... it was cool.   So yeah... yesterday i read Romans, 1 Corinthians, and Revelations... i'm not quite sure why i read the last one, but i did... and it was actually rather refreshing... i havent read my bible in a month or two, but whenever i do, its always more than one book... normally including Esther and Psalms... this time neither... hmm... wonder why... oh well... And much as i love kairsie, i wish she had allowed me to broach the tarot subject to Dennis... but what is done is done, and we all shall survive... it is time for me to think and reflect... and acertain certain beleifs i hold...  and to go read Jon's blog about Fridqay night... this should be good.

      I'm sick, waaaaaaaaaaah  so yeah, i've been feeling like crap since yesterday... forcing myself to eat, but i'm not hungry at all... ready to pass out, and light headed... i just want to sleep, and my sisters are being the demon spawn from hell. Note, i'm being nice about it right now... Not that i want to be...i'm just exausted of not being... And Stephanie's party is tomorrow night, i have to remember to email her, since i'm sleeping over now...another fight with my mom over that...she didnt bother to notice/listen to me about the stuff this weekend until last night, when she was bitching because i didnt tell her! Like hell! its been on the calendar for over a week, and Dad knew! GRRRRRRRR!!!!! she makes me so mad some days... !!!  I've been working on my stories lately, instead of my poetry... and what poetry i've been writing, has been in the form of songs... i might use them in my one story...since the main charchter's a singer... and i need to find exacts for that D&D game...either the 9th or the 16th of August...which means we lost Phil...but hopefully Ashley will be willing to play a cleric... we need the healer! Eh, we shall see... I have to log off to beat the girls...since i hear screaming, crying, cursing, and crashes coming from upstairs...  They never stop...

      Yawnnnnnnn...  not getting enough sleep lately...wonder why? Anywayz, Saturday was the church picnic, and Club Worship...it was amusing, getting out of the car, and having people attack me for being late...felt so loved...*tear* So yeah, that went over well enough, as always, even if most of us were the living dead by the time we started going home or to the studio... And then sunday afternoon Dennis, Daniel, Jeremy, Dave, Phil, and Kairsie came over, and we worked on charchters... This is going to be sooo much fun... assuming we can get Jeremy to alter a few of his traits. And then of course, after that we all walked over to the studio, for the drive to commisioning... the drive itself was great, both to and from, as anyone in the van will probably vouch... although ruthie appeared ver happy to escape sitting beside jeremy. wonder why. lol. Krystal and him seem to have quite a bit in common... they ended up mimicing me and Dennis the last 20 minutes of the drive back...   I'm going to kill the girls!!!! they do nothing but fight, and are definately the source of my headaches. thankfully, sara will be gone next week. that is most definately a blessing. Hmm...i wonder...pool party while Daniel, Kairsie, and Krystal are in Phily? you know...just a baby get together, until we can all get together in august...Oh, and Ashley's agreed to watch the girls the week i'm gone...heaven help them, because shes just as bad as me... yippy. started adding other images to my site...taking the digital to steph's party this weekend(fri) and to jesse's party(sat) so i'll have new stuff on my site soon... its going to be hilarious seeing everyone thugged out.. think camo, wife beaters, boxers, and bandana. fun fun fun.   Oh, and at Bolt.com, under clubs, Literate License's board has the newest sections of my story, life led... just in case anyone was wondering. I dont think i'll be putting it on my site...its way too long already. But i have started work on a new section of my site...havent decided yet where i'm linking it in...not the main menu...i know that already...oh the possibilities...

      Car wash this morning!  it was great, We had Pat and Mrs Clements there, runing the show....then Sierra, me, phil, Jason, Matt, and Sarah from the sr high...and emily, steff, kaity and sara from jr high...And of course adorable lil Jamie was there...he was helping me for a while to stand by the sign(as per orders of Pat) So yeah...it was actually a lot of fun  Got to go see Finding Nemo thursday night with Dennis, Daniel, and Keri...it was a lot of fun...including the part where i got home at midnight to learn Kairsie had gotten locked out of her apartment, and my dad had to loan her a ladder to climb in through the window....  And yesterday was so nice...Frances was in the parade, with her morning daycare group...and after it we went to Mommom and Poppop's house...translation being my mother's parent's...Molly's starting to talk! and Emily is getting so big...shes so adorable...Emmy was soo happy to see us when we got there...Aunt Jeannie was like "chill!, the girls are going to be here all day" and Emmy was like Carolyn! Lets color! lets play on the swings..." Then curling up in the patio chairs...in the shade...with that warm breeze...and a big cup of ice tea...i was in bliss...and then Molly started crying, caus Aunt Jeannie disapeered, and Emmy wanted to get pushed on the swings...and my mom was being herself...and Frances was being annoying, and Sara was beating on frances...and UGH!   But no i've decided what i'm doing with the portion of babysitting money not going to my phone bill, and college...i'm going to replace my dying walkman, and then start saving up for a graphics tablet, so i can actaully do my own lineart, in stead of coloring CG on the computer, that someone else drew initially...  hoepfully i'll get the picture of molly sleeping up on my site...shes such a cutie...

      Phil's party was great, he never even saw it coming.  dare i thank Ashley for being a great friend whenit ends in me getting mad at dennis? I still like the guy, maybe not as much as i did, but there are reasons... and i'mnot 100% sure yet whats been going on...but common nuetral sources state he's talking about me behind my back, and acting like a big baby... I've said i'm sorry... i cant do any more than that. Obviously, and i will say this to him, i can now see how little he truely cares about me... and knows me. I thought we were friends, until i could decide how i felt about this... apparently not. I want to sit and talk about ething with the eagers and casey...we need to figure out whats really going on, and reach a solution... but i'm NOT coddling Dennis. He;s a grown man, and will be treated as such... He can take care of himself. And stop acting like an infant in need of a nap. Speaking of naps... i'm in need of one...this big baby girl should have been in bed a few HOURS ago... i'm in the church service tomorrow, and need a shower so i dont smell like birthday cake and popcorn....

      What the hell?  Okay, so thursday night i found out that daniel blocked my screenname, and that was confusing in itself, and than this morning, maybe an hour ago, Kairsie tells me that i've been blocked by dennis too, because apparently my poem i posted on the guild is attackihng dennis as the offending party in everything thats happened, which is not quite true. And who is he to assume woithout confronting me that i intentially was blaming him via my poetry? who is he to even know when i wrote it? actually i wrote it the other day after i read his poem...but it wasn't labeling him the one at fault...it was purely relevant on the emotional fronts, and had absolutely nothing to do with what physically happend. But who is he to know that? he didnt ask me what it was about. And apprently, Mr and Mrs Eager dont want them talking to me and casey anymore, but hey. i only wanted to stay friends forgive me my human mistakes, jesus christ! I can understand being hurt and having a temper, hell, i've got one now in case anyone reading this couldnt figure it out already. GRRR  But anywayz, i have a D&D game to start soon, so i'll try to type later. forget that we're out Dennis and Daniel, plus kairsie now. So i have enough to worry about without adding the surprise party on top of it, whioch apparently the eagers never got an invite too(like i said, bad day already) and i dont want to sound like i'm taking everything out on those two, i dont mean too, i',m just having a bad day, and they seem to be a central part of it... I'm sorry.   Shattered faith's crystal vase, the container of my trust, and let it spill away... Fragments fall away, like petals on the rose, leaving only the briars... Tears of regret now flow, soaking shards and petals, with a remorse for what passed... Or do they fall for selfishness? Unkown thoughts for even you. Do i want to know? Glue can only pull slivers back into form, urn never the same, a rose can't unwilt it's petals... You've shattered my faith and can't fix it, You've pulled away the roses hope, as you kneel now in prayer.

      I do not need this crap right now...  let me make a list of my faults... maybe someone else willl see where i'm screwed up... heaven knows i cant see it...  bitchy bossy pushy low self esteem annoying jealus cold hearted uncaring annoying voice geeky nerdy talks too much reads too much not popular not experianced too smart too flirt flirts badly bad teeth, bad taste in clothes bad singer obsessive selfsatisfied artist half ass poet lame writer not 100% religiously convicted... 3rd wheel dont fit in wont fit in unskilled not a fantastic student not an athlete glasses frizzy hair red hair small chest anorexically skinny freckles not pretty no money not good enough,  expendable useless  As if i don't have enough trouble, and enough problems...lets add monday night and it's problems...what the hell?  Someday's swallowing a bottle of pills or something stupid like that sounds wonderful...but i dont really want to die, and i know it...i just want to be someone else, in a different life, a different world... Isnt it enough for the world, that i try to be there for my friends? That i listen to their probolems and crap? And then , in return, i have almost noone to turn to when i need a shoulder... or at least that understand what i'm going through... loyalty...thats what i need...I mean, i know i said everything was okay...and i really dont blame her at all. she cant help who she loves...an i underastand that she never meant to hurt me...even though she managed too. no, i hurt myself... if i didnt always fall for guys like this, , i never get bloody hurt. or hurt someone else... i dont blame you 2...i just want to know why i'm not good enough! why i dont have someone who's mine alone.  I know i was calm as ice the other day, when i found out...maybe it was shock...maybe it was denial... i dont know...i mean, i sat, and i thought about it... i really thought about it...How the hell does something like that just happen? Seriously, and i'm still not pissed, i'm not even mad...just dissapointed...and hurt...maybe afterwards you 2 felt guilty about it...and sorry, but at the time...admit it, i was the thing farthest from your thoughts.   And i'm sorry to do this, because it's going to hurt, but i need some time to calm down, and figure things out...Until i know where i stand...We're over. I know i should say thisin person, but i know if i do, i wont be able to focus, or go through with it... and i need to... So maybe this makes me a weak, cruel, coldhearted bitch...i already know i am, tell me something new.  Maybe "just friends" is a bit hard...but right now i need a friend more than a commitment.  ~Cat

And nada's party's tomorrow... if i'm lucky i'll be able to go to YG afterwards... but at the moment, it doesnt seem likely... something about grandparents. Eh, it'll be nice to spend time with them. And lets see... no plans yet for friday... but Dennis keeps asking me if i've made any yet, so there might be something there... Saturday's my beach trip with my sunday school class/youthgroup/family... a mess i know, but at least either way i'm getting to the beach... havent decided what friend i'm bringing yet. And then sunday, its shake sand outa my bag, and grab notebooks for school... yuck! oh yeah, and somewhere in there i need a haircut... need to work on stories, and nada wants me to bring This side of heaven to her party... well see. and i need to mail out Falling away by monday night, since i promised joe... Lit mag this year could be interesting, I'm supposed ton be Art editor, AND assistant editor... simply because i'm there so much for the second, and because i wanted the first... plus i need a new text editor to take my place on chariot staff...aye, time to go beat the girls...not literally...

      2 weeks until school  So Club Worship last night kicked ass, as usual... it's all good. Finished the haunting, great book, now to actually watch the movie. Isecondvited Kim and Christian to knoebals, wish those 2 luck(ya'll know why) This is gonna be fun...D&D-ers, the 30th, hopefully... but in case of Jesse's party getting moved to that date, leave the next weekend open... so yeah... Church was good today... Pastor Donna's last day, as our summer preacher, Tim's picnic is wednesday... i'm doing face painting for it... Simzy's party's tomorrow... dont know if i'll be going... we shall see.   Sigh... sigh... the things i can't put in a web diary... things that would cause problems with people... sigh... loggin off, guess i'll go work on one of my stories, and listen to Meteora...  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  I'm falling away from you, into the abyss of my dreams. life line to the world fraying, lose me to that dark mystery. fall forward, fly ahead, and concer my world tonight.  Tonight i'm falling away, embrace deep depths of my dreams. leave you behind on the brink of reality, i'd call out if i could speak. surrendar my voice for a sea of dreams. reality into mind illusions.  (Pre chorus) collapse on the edge, slide off into forever, catch me, and i'll slip through your fingers.  (Chorus) Falling away tonight, leave reality behind. dropping down towards forever, dreams reveal my true mind. I'm falling away from you.  Dreams grow as i fall in, my mind to see furture's sights. reveal everything, and nothing at all, as i forget your earthly delight, when you fail to catch me once more, and i fall down again.  Chorus  I still stumble, i still fall down, float past my daytime thoughts, explore the corners of my mind. discover my heart. would you ever truly catch me? or will i always fall away?  (Bridge) I stumble, the edge of reality crumbles, my night mares come to life.  Curl fingers about my hands yet i fall, a ghost can't embrace the living. wake up to find my dreamwold is the place i'm seeing. Did you ever try to save me? Or did you mean for me to fall?  Prechorus Chorus 2X  I'm falling away from you 2X Catch me again, and i'll watch you fall away.

      I"M HOME!!!!!  I dont think its possible for me to  completely  recount my week, i dont think i'd even want to. So put easily, i met a bunch of new people, had a load of fun, got addicted to being around certain friends, and performed Godspell. Okay, so there were some major events and details in there, from Girls Cabin 2's dirty minds, to getting carried across stage. I'm slowly adding pictures to my website, with labels so people from camp can ask for copies emailed to them... lalalalalalalala if i ever have to sing All for the best again, someone may end up hurt. Well, maybe only getting me ticked off... but anywayz....  Sacred campfire Thursday night, and the talk afterwards, with Kim B and Christian, was great... and will probably stick with me for awhile. Well, that among other events. Anywayz, it felt so weird, so far, not being able to turn around and talk to those 2... or Mike, Kim M, Big Kyle, Jake, Molly, and the others... Sigh... its soo weird, and i miss everyone!!!! Its not fair!!!  And i'm kinda bugged now that Dennis didnt ask about camp, outside of the concept that i was home...Sigh... oh well, i'll deal... its not like its the end f the world or anything... just an amazing week in my life. So anywayz, now that i'm home, i can update my site, edit pictures, talk on the phone/online... and harrass my mom to hook up my graphics tablet. oh, and check on my clubs... Literate License, on BOLT, is about to lose a great member, unless people start appreciating Art(Sadgoth) and they'r begining to bug me with not checking up on it.  As for Kim and Christian, It was great getting to spend time with them this last week, and cool that i can actually tell them things so easily. Things i wouldnt normily discuss so easily... its just kinda odd, to think about it, like i did saturday afternoon... that in a week, i became that attached... I hate to admit it, but i actually started to cry, thinking about not being around everyone... Sigh, we seriously need to hang out!!!!!!  and for anyone who didnt read it before, or doesnt quite understand my views on religion yet... I'm posting my song again... read it, maybe you'll learn something.  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~  Close your lips,  Canít close your mind,  Make me listen all the time.  But when my turn finally comes,  Suddenly youíre deaf and dumbÖ   Try to follow the logic,  Of the way this should work.  Listen to the grown-ups,  But stay mute, no talking,  Too young to know anythingÖ   (Pre Chorus)  Chained into a church mouse,  My beliefs on the blade of a knife.   (Chorus)  Get a grip, get a life,  Playing the mind games of life,  On the edge, of a blade, of a knife.  And you wonder why Iím rebelling,  When Iíve got all these thoughts,  But nobodyís listeningÖ   Iím supposed to be  The next ruling crowd,  But here I stare at the floor,  Eyes down, hands clenched,  Mind bent on breaking freeÖ   They tell me to live free,  Clipping my wings for eternityÖ   Never question the status quo,  Flow the way your elders flow.  Be mature but be still meek.  Only clichÈs may I speak,  The lies the world would keepÖ   Pre Chorus   Chorus 2X   Balance on the blade of a knifeÖ  When Iíve got these thoughts,  But nobodyís listeningÖ   Nobody ever listensÖ

By the way, if anyone knows a place that sells nice jeans, prefereably in a size 1, for REASONABLE prices... i'm all ears. And if anyone knows a place hiring, because i really need a job, so i have money to replace my fall apart cloths.  CW last night was a lot of fun, despite getting attacked with a newly filled glow ink pad...by daniel. and having my smilie slinky stollen like a hundred times... GEEZ people... get YOUR OWN!!!! lol, but anywayz... we had a lot of fun, even if most staff member were dead by the time clean up started. Note to self, talk to dad about security tshirts for staff...  back to sorting cloths and reading Sabriel.(10 cents!!!) You cant beat a flea market...

      la de da...  Did a tarot reading for joel today, do i care that people think i'm damned for it? NO. and if i am, oh well... its only an eternity. which is significantly better than the hell i'd go through denying part of myself.  So anywayz, its actually a pretty opposite reading from what he says he normally gets on them... i have to wonder how much my thoughts affected it. i dont think they did... i did one to clear my mind, and reshuffled without checking them... La de da...  Formatted my poetry today, or what i have typed... if anyone knows of a spot where i saved/posted my poem Z square, i would greatly appreciate it being emailed to me... i dont know where to find a copy of my own poem... i lost the draft, and didnt save it on my PC... sigh... well back to my other 49 pages...  Oh, and the whole mess with Dennis, Casey, and Daniel has been resolved, thank the spirit(i'm going away from traditional father/son/christ adjectives...dont ask why, i'm odd like that.)  But yes, so thats all taken care of... which is great... now we can all worry about reafirming our friendship, and sorting out personal problems.... yippee!   well back to talking with Joel... i'm getting feedback... so far i'm like 95% accuracy with tarot. 2 mistakes... you do the math.

German exchange students had their last day today. Chel's happy, Johanna was getting on her nerves. time to go bury myself in a good book... Club Worship tomorrow night. aye... back to the same ol same ol.... and perhaps sleep....  A few more joke things i found on the net and in emails...  ~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~ Reasons why men should worship women. All this information is backed up by scientific proof.   1. Without women you will not be here today. 2. Worship women, anyone who is a woman. Every woman is like your mum, don't rape a woman, unless u'r willing to rape ur own mum. (Oh...EW!) 3. Women are superior to men, cos u need more than 40 million sperms to fertilize an ovum/egg.  4. Sperms are 75 000 times smaller than ovum?s. 5. Females have two x chromosomes, which carry genes. Males have only one x chromosome, and this x chromosome come from ur mother only. Males all ur genes except ur sex come from ur mother. (Who IS female) 6. X chromosomes bear over 2 500 genes, Y carries only 15. Therefore, U have 2 485 genes less than a female. *cackle* 7. A male is a biological accident. Y (male) gene is an incomplete X (female) gene. 8. In other words, the male is an incomplete female, thus a walking abortion. ( Males u're cacated) 9. From health statistics, in the past 50 years, average volume of ejaculate fluid declined by 20%, AND sperm quality is dropping. 10. There is a greater % of deformed and sluggish sperms. (That means u're demented, deformed........oh this is hilarious!!) 11. Women are multi talented. They are now full-time career women, and yet they can still run a household. Guys on the other hand come home from work, and complain. (They also slump on the couch with a beer then promptly fall asleep and snore...) 12. Women have a higher threshold of pain, that?s why GOD gave us the power to give birth and bring life into this world.  13. Women have a longer life expectancy. (Probably coz we're less prone to accidents ... as in we don't crash our cars into lamp posts while trying to check out a girls tits or butt) 14. Young men run a much greater risk than young women from dying of accidents and violence. (Coz guys haven't enough brains to talk their way out of situations...look at Arnold Schwachaneggar) 15. MEN are dumb, so interested in the females breasts, IT'S ONLY a LUMP of FAT. 16. Females are highly specialized beings; we have two openings for pleasure and urine excretion. Guys only have ONE urethra where both sperm and urine passes.  17. And for extra info, urine is acidic, which makes it an unsuitable condition for sperm. (Probably contributes to the whole "sperm quality is reducing thingy...hehehe..) 18. In the brain, testosterone is converted to estrogen, to bring about its stimulatory effects. SO listen up guys, the male hormone has to be changed into the female hormone to bring about masculinizing effects. (Ure not so macho without female hormones.) 19. Your mitochondria ( energy source) comes from your mother not your father. (So ure more female than u think!) 20. Males only have testosterone and a little quantity of estrogen as sex hormones. Females have more, we have estrogen, progesterone and testosterone. Mind u we have more testosterone than u have of our estrogen. 21. There is a higher level of fatality in male foetuses. (Dahlah no sperm quality...now the foetus cepat mati pulak??) 22. The Y chromosomes of males is smaller than the X chromosome which is a female. 23. Every male is part of a female, as u carry our X chromosomes. Thus, EVERY male is 50% female. (TALK ABOUT EGO-DEBUSTION) 24. Although females are the ones who give birth and conceive, more males are likely to have a breakdown during pregnancy of their spouses. We go through the pain, and u cry more than we do. (don't say it's compassion!) 25. Before u r born a male, ure a female first for the first 12 weeks in ur mothers womb. (More ego debustion) 26. Behind every successful man, there is a woman. BUT behind every successful woman, is herself.  27. The males have bigger brains than women. But WOMEN use a higher % of their brains than men. (That WOULD be pretty obvious.) 28. Women have lower risks of high cholesterol levels, than males, all thanks to our monthly periods. So women be thankful that we menstruate. (ok, that's new) 29. Many males out there keep asking for virgin brides. Honestly if u want a virgin bride, than be a virgin urself. Don't carry STD's and give it to ur virgin bride. She doesn't deserve it. (Hear ye!) 30. There are more good looking females out there than males. You can't count the number of extremely pretty women, its countless ( Cindy Crawford, Aishwarya Rai, Elle Macpherson, Julia Roberts, Jeniffer Lopez........). how many males can u list??? 31. U find pleasure in superficial stuff (Pamela Anderson is plastic and make up)  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* The 6 most important guys in a women life  1.) THE DOCTOR- becasue he says "Take your clothes off."  2.) THE DENTIST- becasue he says "Open wide."  3.) THE MILKMAN- becasue he says "Do you want it in the front or back?"  4.) THE HAIRDRESSER- becasue he says "Do you want it teased or blown?"  5.) THE INTERIOR DECORATOR- becasue he says "Once it is in, you'll love it."  6.) THE BANKER- becasue he says " IF you take it out to soon, you'll lose interest."  ~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~  Top 13 signs your wedding day isn't going well:  13. You're forced to exchange vows from separate rooms because of that week-old restraining order. 12. The bride's father gets his feelings hurt when her pimp insists on giving her away. 11. Even though he's sitting in the front row, you still don't remember the Grim Reaper being on the guest list. 10. At the end of the ceremony, Reverend Jones proposes a Kool-Aid toast. 9. Your bride enthusiastically shouts, "I do!" Unfortunately, it's when the priest asks if anyone objects to the marriage. 8. The ceremony starts in 20 minutes and you're still fighting over who gets to wear the dress. 7. The ceremony is spoiled by the insistent beeping from the bride's ankle cuff. 6. When the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy crew shows up to help plan the upcoming honeymoon, your fianc√© becomes alarmingly smitten with Carson the fashion savant. 5. "Something blue" is Grandma. Better call 911. 4. After greeting your bride by name, the honeymoon hotel clerk asks if she wants the room for the whole night this time. 3. You spot Ron Jeremy (the porn star) sitting on the bride's side of the church. 2. The groom refuses to put on the ring on your finger, saying, "Not the Preciousssss!" 1. You can't seem to find your tuxedo pants. But even if you could, the wedding is in Nebraska and you're handcuffed to a dominatrix in Singapore.

      Who let me and Mom loose in a bookstore?  Brats and Dad ended up not going camping, so naturally even though i didnt actually fall asleep til about 3, i ended up getting woke up at 7 since the monsters were whining... But they left around 3 to go to my godfathers, and me and mom went out shopping... 2 bookstores, we found the newest tamora pierce book!!! It's Alanna's daughter... cant wait for mom to finish reading it! And then i picked up a few books...Oh well, its not like i have to worry about money or anything.. just because i have no job, and all ~_~.  Jeremy's birthday party was last night... had to leave in the middle of an episode of Ayashi no Ceres to get there... grr. And then i found out i was the only girl...(Kairsie's mad about that one) and i was last place the first LQ game, and 4th the second. interesting, to say the least. I knew everyone he invited except one. better than i'd expected. Fun at least.  Spirit Games yesterday at school... wore the jr class shirts i designed that me and steph tye died... they went over great. (not bragging, its a fact) Darrill and Alexa were both in the "Wyo Idol" competiton we had in the morning(sad, i know) Alexa was in the singing competitoon, and redid part of the lyrics to "that dont impress me" by shania to suit seniors... "so youre a senior..." and the guys got the brunt of it. which i thought was a hilarious, as did everyone else. well... excluding a few seniors. And how many boys, who are cheerleaders, wouldgo up in front of everyone in their new school, and cheer, and do a great job? (minus almost falling off the stage after a one hand cartwheel) anywayzx... the seniors won that one as always. but we beat them sooo bad at academic challege on wednesday, so its all good.  and then there was the part leavin the audi where i got pushed into gwen, which resulted(eventually) with me getting punched in the face. i hope the bitch has a miscarriage. heaven and hell know the baby'll have a better life if she does, freakin 15 yr old slut. so now i have to hand in an incident report to the dean on monday, but i at least dont have any bruises from it. Samantha's pissed now, and cant wait for the baby to be born... she's gonna beat the crap out of Gwen if i dont get her to see its worthless... stupid idiot... she hit me, in front of a huge mass of people... and its on her record, not mine. (note, i didnt realize the rumor of her being pregant was true until after i got home, and everything had happened.) but still...grrr.  anywayz. homework for monday to finish, talking to Joel and Kairsie, and mom's having me go driving tomorrow morning before church. Finally. yawn, anywayz.  ~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~  Stare out of my lonely soul. wonder if youre lettin go. should i hold onto you heart? when nothings what it seems.  relent -less is never more. wonder what you have in store. can i survive the nezxt step? when we're playin with fire.  (and)if i go- would you stop me? falling down- try to catch me. fading to black- resurect my soul... if youd even know (to look for me beneath you)  pictures taped to a wall. wonder what i just saw. can you ezxplain this to me? outrunning our destiny!  Touchdown calling out your name. wonder is this all a game? did i fall into your trap? or is more still to come.  (And)i dont know what to say. why do i always feel this way? are you pulling my strings? or just pulling me down.  lower and lower mass confusion again. harder and harder the pounding within. how will this all end?  (And) If i go- will you stop me? (I'm) fallin down- can you catch me? trapped in darkness- resurrect my soul. If you even know (to look for me beneath you)  resurrect ressurect  my soul

       ~If paybacks a bitch and revenge is sweet. i'm the sweetest bitch you will ever meet.~  ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~   Laura once told me about a skit someone she knew did. It made me think. She acted it out for us at Youth Musical the one night.   Laura sat down, with a belaying rope tied in a noose, hanging around her neck. naturally, everyone wasconcerned about it, and a number of people wanted her to take it off. She asked them why? what was wrong with wearing a noose? someone answered that it could kill people... you hang yourself with a noose. She nodded and looked at the other people sitting with us. She asked people what they had around their necks, since she wore a noose. One of the counselors, Andy, had a gold chain on, with a gold cross. Someone pointed, and said a cross. So she repeated that... "you cant wear a noose, because it kills people. But a cross is okay... because no one ever died on a cross."  That was the summer before last, and it still sticks with me... think about it.  ~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~+~  welcome to day 5795(give or take a day roughly) of my misunderstood life...  and while i realize my friends are just so wonderful and are of course kjust mentioning the "rumors" going around because they want me to be informed, not because they beleive them of course, it does hurt a bit... People, no, my FRIENDS, actually beleive that i never took my relationship with Dennis seriously? That i cant/dont take my religion seriously?   my religion as it is put so wonderfully doesnt even take itself seriously, and when it does, it takes itself too seriously. Maybe i dont have the closest connection in the world to my God, but at least i dont go around killing people becausee they dont call him by the same name i use for him. Maybe i dont always concetrate on every service i go to, but at least i am following my God. Maybe i dont give up everything for him, dont lay down my heart and soul for him... but i have YET to see one of my friends, the ones who've talked about me, lay down everything.   And dont tell me i am not a good christian because i am pro choice. It is my beleifs, not yours, dont start. i put up with a lot from people trying to force beleifs on me... always christian beleifs... "Youre not a strong enough christian" "be a better christian" "if you were only a more faithfull christian" SHUT UP and listen to yourselves. Its just a name... and youre turning it into an icon... as if being called a christian is the best thing in the world. If people who followed God, and BELIEVED(note, not followed or worshiped) in his son Christ ere called sludge, it would not be used so often, as an excuse for everything....   If i am not a good christian, than let me be a good pagan, a good stickdweller, to be the last to see God's kindom... because i don't want what is offered to me at the cost of conformity by those who claim it is my eternal salvation at risk... i'm already living in my personal Hell, created by the people i love most, who are trying so hard to save me. And i cant explain it in words... its thoughts, ideas, and feelings, all rolled into one... and utterly unexpressable... at least in the tongues i know... but somehow, it seems like I'm cut off almost completely from the way everyone thinks... with only a thread or two connecting me... with only one or two people in the whole world who understand me........ and somedays i dont even have them.  think of me what you please. laugh, scold, ridicule, proclaim me damned. I'll hear your words... but they have lost their meaning with overuse.

       Last Saturday, at club worship, I slapped DennisÖ I know, some people think he deserved it, some think Iím a violent little bitch. Iíd have to agree with both groups. As much as he annoys me some days, okay, a lot of days, but thatís part of who he isÖ anywayz, I really shouldnít have hit himÖ And then there was the part where I was just in a foul mood all evening, getting slowly worseÖ Krystal lying to Ashley didnít help whatsoeverÖ or the part where she lied to me eitherÖ aye, chica muy tonta. And then my back spazzed up,. And some guy came in who looked just like my most recent picture of Joel, only wearing a white shirt, shaved, and no shadesÖ talk about freaky. Not a good Saturday, even if I did have a chance to see everyone againÖ speaking of which, I have to check when the swap over is for youth groupÖ  I really need to get off my lazy ass and get a jobÖI whine about it but really havenít done that much. And Iím still working on getting my license too. This week has really suckedÖ although I havenít screwed up on anythingÖ Guys have been hounding me lately, which is hilarious in itself, because before thanksgiving of last year, almost none of them even talked to meÖ English teacher is going to hate me now, since I was supposed to give my speech Tuesday, but it got pushed back one day (all of them did). So I was supposed to go today, but Mrs. O wasnít in class, so none of us went today, and that means I have to go tomorrow, but I wont be in class because of the Art Major III trip to PhilidelphiaÖ Sheís gonna blow a gasket, and I personally plan to bitch back if she starts on me.. I can get into Kutztown even if my grades donít make NYU ratingsÖ so I could care less what she ATTEMPTS to do to me this year.     Things could get interesting nowÖ oh, and Rochelle is being a jealous bitch about DarrillÖ poor baby acts like me and Christine actually want to steal the boy from her, if heís actually even considered hersÖ Now while I know heís a ver nice guy, and adorable etc, Iím not the type to try to steal the boys my friends like, especially when Iím getting sick of asses breathing down my neck as it isÖ Grr. Life is way to complicated. Can I please go back to preschool, when all I had to learn was the alphabet and 123sÖ sighÖ I donít want to grow up, and I cant wait. It makes no sense, but thatís what it is...

         and sooo on.....  And weíre talking about mask in Honors EuroÖ Mann has us reading In Praise of Folly, by ErasumusÖ which discusses how in older plays, if you had taken off the masks of actors, roles would be reversedÖ because things are not what they appear, and each actor plays more than one partÖ then he equates it to our actual societyÖ now, this wouldnít have seemed that big of a concept, except one of the last times I was at Youth Group, one of the Prayer Group Leaders, Gabby, had talked to us about taking off our masks, and what type of masks we show to the world, and what we hid behind themÖ And in Class, Mr. Mann made the equation to the idea of dating someone thinking they were one person, then seeing behind the mask, and not necessarily liking what you seeÖ which completely makes senseÖ expecially when I think about the whole mask concept, because I know I present a number of masks, a number of personalitiesÖ I have the person I am with my parents, and familyÖ I have the persona I adopt for school, the image I present to those at church and youth group, the faÁade I raise around friendsÖ and it builds upÖ to where if I didnít know I did it, I would think that those people called Cat werenít meÖ because I only have one real mask, one persona, that I wear that is almost my ìtrue imageîÖ that being who I am at Swatara, away from people who know me 24/7, that expect me to act a certain wayÖ and Iím not saying thatís not a mask tooÖ because it is; they expect a perfect Christian, and if not perfect, then at least secure, and conservativeÖ and Iím neitherÖ I may not dress like a slut, but the clothes I select for camp arenít my normal summer fairÖ I donít believe as completely as they do in GodÖ maybe because of any of a hundred reasonsÖ and Iím rambling nowÖ for anyone who read this far, I hope you thought about something newÖ If itís Casey, sis, I canít explain my religious beliefs to youÖ Iíve tried, and canít even begin to put it to wordsÖ. Donít think badly of me for itÖ Iíve tried. God knows Iíve triedÖ

      Looking through my mailbox a few minutes ago and look what i found.  This is a copy of the things people said last sunday in prayer groups. Keep it stored in your sotrage bin, or keep it marked as new, or whatever your mail service offers. I will also have a copy in my little golden writers book that will be kept in the prayer group room. Whenever you feel that your walk is going no where, or if you're just depressed, or if you feel like you haven't accomplished anything, read and re-read this and remember the good things people see in you. As it's been said to me many times, we cannot see ourselves grow, but other people can notice everything.   Jaron- mature, you know who you are and your comfortable with yourself.  Daniel- Haven't killed sisters yet (lol) Great perserverance  Rachel-really cool  Krystal- Optimistic, high spirits  Kairsie- extramly independant and can take care of yourself. You don't take crap from people, and you're not afraid to speak your mind. I also like how your willing to challange your faith and prove other people wrong (even when I disagree:) ) A great little sister. Very mature for your age  Deanna- happy-go-lucky.

       Alone  My world fell apart today, With tears streaming down my face. And I couldnít stand on my own, But I was standing alone. I cried alone.  You promised me youíd always stand Beside me when I need a hand. Yet Iím crying to an empty sky, Because today you passed me by.  Am I supposed to trust, Trust the one whoís turned away? Did you know you ignored, Ignored me on my hardest day? Iím crying alone.  Calling out your given name, You donít come and I canít blame. I never should have believed, Should have known youíd leave.  I donít want to believe in my heart, That your promise has broken apart. But for now Iíll suffer on, Trying to stand on my own. Iíll cry alone.  Okay, so i'm currently trying to get what Casey told me last night, which was, and i quote "it's so obvious he's like madly in love with you" about Joel. Now I am fully aware that the two of us are close(me and Joel, although i'm close to kairsie too) but in love with me? After hearing about a few comments? i coulda sworn we were talking about how great my friends were and then that came out of left field... Waaaaaah, you people thrive upon confusing me!!!!   And of course tackle ultimate frisbee monday kicked ass. it was soooo much fun. Okay, so my neck feels like it was snapped, and i have a few lil bruises... but so does everyone else so eh, not a biggy.   And my downstairs neighbor, la bruja mejor, she moved out today with her bratty lil daughter, locking EVERY possible entrance to her apartment(including our basement door) turning on every electrical thing in the apartment, and turning OFF the heater... My house feels like a fridge, but it'll be better in a few hours. The landlord drove to her new house and demanded she drive here and turn off her crap and turn on the heater and give us a set of the keys. it was great.   things to think about every day of my life, and twenty thousand extra today...  c'est la vie . i'll live, i always have... it'd be nice to keep thattrend going.

      This is going to be ver long so get comfy.   *My weekend was a good oneÖ overall full of fun, deep thoughts, and growth.  The road rally taught me to wear 2 pairs of socks in winter, that any McDonalds  open at Midnight is to be praised, and that life is full of wrong turns. And it had  a few other comparisons as explained by our speaker Kendall. The niceness  war continued with help of the girlís side Saturday morning. We made breakfast  for the guys and served them in bedÖ which has now prompted the phrase  ìtrust in Janelle.î In return for our work Jeremy and Victor cleaned the dishes for  us, and Sunday morning all of the guys set the table, put out flowers, and  served us breakfast with personalized poems. So after a few closed conferences,  and worries that we wouldnít be able to out-nice the boys, Deanna, Laura,  Kairsie, me and some others wrote poems to go on the guys doors, made up ëlil  baggies of candy to go on each pillow, and made their beds. ~_~ But who knows  what the guys are going to do in retaliation? Hmm... anywayz the whole  weekend definately proved that i have the best friends ever... oh wait, i already  knew that... and it helped me re-establish my faith again... definately among the  best things. And the weekend made me think.  *Alex, thank you for your concern and for talking to me... Even if i was half asleep  at the time and temperarily confuzzled. The image you shared with me will  definately stay in my mind for a while. And you're right; I do have a lot of thorns   that prevent me from living... And i've been thinking about that a lot the last week  and a half or so... Some of my closest friends have no clue just how much my   "thorns" affect my life... or how they grew and why... And maybe listing them here  won't make everything better, but for me its a step closer...admitting them in words  instead of thoughts.  *I don't trust people. Maybe on the outside i do... but not really. I've known this for  awhile now... and a lot of my problems come from it. My parents... they're probably  the only people in the world that i completely and entirely trust in. I know in my  heart that they would never betray me, or knowingly hurt me. Theyd never give up  on me, and because of that, i trust them more than i've ever trusted anyone else.   And because of them, i think i'm more comfortable around older people... but i really  dont know.  *It didnt occur to me that i'd been so untrusting of people... of my friends, until Dennis  pointed it out to me, innocently, in a chainletter email... one of those ones that you  send to friends, and they fill out about you... well it was his answer for "what about  me do you most dislike?"  I think it comes from elementary school... back when i lived  on the other side of the bridge. That was my world when i was little. And if part of my world when i was younger was  a girl who hated me for 7 years of my existance... well that's life. So Lauren Czarneki  hated me, and i still dont know why. My parents, Lord bless them,  swear she was  jealous of me. But what have i ever been or had to be jealous of? I was a short kid,  with big glasses, who read too much, and dressed differently. If anything, back then  i was sheltered.  And that girl hated me. She pretended to be my friend more than  once, only to stab me in the back. In first grade, she tried to hurt my best friend by  pushing us apart... and she knew it hurt me. I don't think i've ever forgiven Lauren for  that. That girl stole from me, degraded me, made my life miserable, and because she  got other people to help her... after awhile it became part of me...i believed what they  said.  *I still do, despite how i act, and what people tell me... Guys expecially. Some of the  kids i was friends with in preK and kindergarden... swapped sides later on...if you can  say that... Apparently you couldnt be friends with me and Lauren back then. Other  friends left at the end of the year... and never came back. When i saw saw of them,  they werent the same people. And most of the others... they were never really my  friends. The guys teased me...a LOT.  I really hated being made fun of. Or used. Some  kids became friends with me for a little because teachers liked me...  Teachers are  guardian angels in disguise, i swear.  *To make a long story short...I don't trust people because i've been hurt more than a  few times by the ones i've trusted. I'm afraid if i open up, completely, it'll happen again.  I don't depend on guys or let them to emotionally close because i always seem to get  hurt... I act like everything's fine and that nothing bothers me because people have  used my faults and weaknesses against me. People depend on me to be strong, to be a  helping hand and a comforting shoulder. I LIKE being there for them... but when i need  that same sort of listening ear...they're paying attention to something else... or arent  there. So I act like everythings great... because i'm scared. If i venture my beliefs or  thoughts around others...even if i can argue them 100%, i'm looked at as different,  strange, rebellious, or wrong...   *Back in August i wrote a list of things...things i felt were true about myself. It's a list i  revert to whenever something big and hurtful happens... That i can't forget... At the  time it was posted because someone i was begining to trust a great deal bretrayed that  trust... with a ver close friend of mine. I've forgiven both of them... i KNOW they never  wanted to hurt me... But with my trust broken i had to let go of something that was  special to me... That relationship will never be regained. I wouldn't want to copy it with  someone else either...  And this isn't where i meant to go with this, but i feel i have to write it. That person,  who i had to let go of, is doing himself a great injustice. He made a promise to himself  that he broke... A promise that anyone who cared about him should help him honor.  And he seems to have forgotten it since August... It makes me sad that someone, who  has more faith in God than i may ever have, has abandoned a promise they made to  themself and God...   I'm going to remember that image... And i'm going to try to remove my thorns... And i  know i can't do it alone.

      Somehow i just feel so.... lost   I prayed today. in the middle of the afternoon. for no real reason except that i just  felt   that i should. and somehow...it helped... A literal and spiritual cool breeze in the warm  air. I know it sounds weird to some people reading this, to others its too true...but  anywayz.... it did help. Except now i just feel ver lost... Ive finally come to understand  my religious beleifs fully... and what that means in my relationship with God... but the  rest of my life seems to fall to peices when i concentrate on faith...and vice versa... i  never seem to find the middle road. And lately i've noticed a pattern in my relationships... bad to horrible.  all the guys that ever  really  like me... i dont care about in that way... even if it takes a  bit to realise it, it always comes down to just not feeling the same about them as they  think they do about me... maybe i  am  really the cold hearted bitch i've been labled... its  so easy for me to lock up emotions... because i  dont  normally feel strongly about  anyone.... and when i do...it blows up in my face. or gets me into cycles like this... where i just wish i could want to die... it really  sux ! All my friends and their wonderful  relationships... so happy...  and its so easy for them...expecially keri, ashley, and christine... And i cant even get a  date for  prom ! Kairsie cares... but what about the others? if i just stopped showing up at school,  would they bother to find out what was wrong? I feel so taken for granite some days. I wonder about things a lot. maybe too much. and my poetrys been getting more  depressed lately.  But I'll be getting my License soon... another month or so hoepfully... And fourth  Quarter starts on tuesday...and after that, only another year until college. Maybe  then i'll be able to just concentrate on school and faith, and being on my own... and  forget the fact that i cant have a good girl/guy relationship worth a hill a beans...

      For everything there is a season... a time to laugh and a time to cry...   my life is so bipolar that i want to cry. one minute i love how things are, everythings figured out, nothing to worry about... no complications... and then... the retreat came along. Lord above help me but i just  want to SCREAM. Fortunately for those living between here and china...i'm not going  to... at least not this week... but a good cry before i go to bed sounds heavnly. too  bad it wont help anything. it wont even make me feel better...  I dont really care if he gets upset by me posting stuff here, but Daniel and i have been  having some issues lately... our friendships on th e borderline of something... a  change... and i dont know if i want it to go farther, or not. I mean... he's Dennis's  brother!!! not to mention Dave's friend!!! But there is an interest there. And i dont  know if its something that'll just go away, or if its something more than that... and from  what he's said to me... he has a similar dilema...at least...an interest, but but past  relationships could make it weird... He's kissed Ashley and asked Keri out for pete's  sake... It's all soo confusing...and theres nothing anyone can really do to help.   And on top of that theres upcoming prom stresses starting to accumulate with people...  expecially those bugging me about who i'm going with (at the moment, no one) And  people's reklationship drama... dont get me started, its insane what people put  themselves through...but i still luv those nuts.  and fingers crossed...my parents have been offered a house if they can afford it. its  next door to my godparents house, and would allow me my own room again(halleluja)  but we might not be able to get it...and i desperately want my own room again.   and another day added to the 3rd quarter...which means another day to make up... waaah. oh well. life goes on. long after the thrill of living is gone.  urlLink

      yawnnnnnnnnnnnnn  trip to new york tomorrow, to see "movin out". could be cool. no, should be cool. listening to my mom bitch about work...she seems to do this quite a bit... painting for art is almost done.... i cant beleive how much my birthday sucked. my dad never even actually said happy birthday, and i didnt even get any aknolegement from his side of the family! what the heck? the one gift i got from family, being my Mom Mom, whom normally has good taste... bought me a shirt in one of the two colors i refuse to wear(red) and a zip up sweater(itchy itchy) luv her to bits, normally wouldnt complain... but its a waste of money, because i'll NEVER wear them, and they'll wind up NEVER getting returned because my mom's family is anti returns.... i know 17 doesnt have many perks... but i personally think it SUX!!!!!! Itd be nice to at least have a little birthday party... Granted darryll and christine wanted to have an impromptu party bowling....but i hate bowling...and they never bothered telling me what time or where.... birthdays are supposed to be happy...mine was migraines, homework, naseau, people complaining, and a few happy birthdays from friends and teachers... and 4 birthday cards. yippy(note massive amount of sarcasm)   so being 17 sux  and prom, yeah... who knows whats going on with that... Daniel has offered to go with me... School sux... life in general sux... i'm living because i know it cant get much worse. And i still cant beleive Frances got her ears pierced...   i'm gonna go cry... the people i need to/want to talk to arent online as usual...or arent at home...or just arent available... well excluding one, but hes in california, and is out of it right now... so what should i care? Not that crying's likely...maybe i'll get as far as teary eyed... nothing more than thats likely... it'd be nice to know i had someone CLOSE i could just cry with/whine to about how much stuff sucks... but i dont. Kairsie, luv her dearly... too much of it she just wouldnt understand... and its not something i can go to a stranger about... ashley's skipping school too much to be of help, with jason breaking up with her and all... christine's preocupied with the whole Matt dating thing... rochelle not a friend anymiore samantha isnt there steph's working on getting her stepbrother situated here carolines ...not that type of friend niether's mel or Alica or Laura itd be way too awkward with Dave... Dennis doesnt even speak to me and Daniel... whatever...  and people wonder why i dont open up about crap. HA!  i'm going to bed. maybe i'll even do some trig HW on the bus tomorrow...

      Outmanuevered yet again!  I dont know how she did it( besides half mugging me in the hall ) but Keri's managed to  make me reagree to go to prom...well, actually, shes forcing me to go,  even  if it means  dragging me kicking and screaming the whole way. Well...stephanie and i are now  making sure everyone has a date/guest and that everyone of our friends is at one of  two tables( we so special ) oy, but its really so people stop bitching and fighting about  whos going with us. Ashley and Matt H are going...i'm gonna make sure of that. Hes  upset cause shes uset and shes upset because Amy's a  bitch . And Ashley made the  mistake of inviting amy to sit with us, and now i'm inviting Missy to sit with us, and this  is gonna get  ugly ! Because if Amy keeps pulling this shit I"M going to break a very  strong New Years Resolution to not be so violent, and  i'm  gonna beat the living shit out  of her,  before  going to the guidence counselors to get her TASARed. GRRRR.  So yeah, tomorrow's shadowing for event day...aka no school for Jrs. Goin to work with dad... talkin to artists pretty much. but it'll be cool. So yeah...my eyes are mad puffy from allergies...i  think its cat fur...thats normally the case in spring/winter... but we'll see...well, actually, you will,  because my eyes are  so  itchy/puffy that i cant see to well. waaah.

      DIEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!   I feel better. actually, i feel like shit, but when you spend half the day arguing  with your friends about Prom, this is bound to happen. In a quick overview,  I'm not going, so go blow and stop harrassing me. I'm tired of everyone trying  to find Cat a date she cant stand, so i'm sick of everyone also changing their  minds about dates. AND i'm sick of everyone fighting over whos going to sit  together at the table for prom. so DIE. You can cross me off the bloody limo  hrrassment list and the table sign up list. I"M NOT GOING. If ya'll quit whining  about Prom i  might  go to Post Prom Party.  Registered for SATs today, that took freakin forever...and i went to school goth ...kinda funny... I hate school... i hate hate hate hate hate school. Another 6  years and i'll hopefully be done with it. Thats college too. i seriously just want to  fast forward life five years. And leave the country...politics in this country are  nuts. And everyone knows Kermit the frog should be president. Ugh. I'm just  going to go talk to Jenni about stuff (like food...yummies)  and wait for Joel to get  back... Sigh. Sleepage.    Song:  "Down With The Sickness" by Disturbed  Emotion:  Irritated

      Yawn...class make me so sleepy  So i totally slept through half of my classes... and the teachers didnt even yell at  me. wahhooo. And during study hall...me and christine were being silly...and i  was bored....so we wrote on eachother's hips... i now say property of Christine.  Yay. And she says property of cat. Which david noticed during Chem... Hehehe... that was funny.  Gotta type my poem for English tomorrow...and read my chapetr on polar  coordinates... ughh...i have a 91% in Truig...how nuts is that? Lol. And kairsie's  makin fun of Daniel today...it was hilarious. But its his own fault for adding that  last line in red to his profile. Get real. Any girl with real worth isnt going to see  that and jump at the chance. What does he think he is? Don Juan? Lol...men... think they so smooth. Like superglue. ~_~ Yawn...Should go i guess...or at least grab my cell in case Jeremy calls about  prom like he said he would.. i tired. but i like talking to Joel and people. waah.

      Poetry Festival kicked ass.  The festival was fabulous, despite our lacking numbers... ver fun. Got to  play receptionist...announcer, and photographer. ver cool. And i babysat j  last night... but couldnt sleep so i talked to Joel on my cell for a few hours...  Which was enjoyable. for more than one reason. But so yeah... How do you  help a friend that you arent even sure of what their exact problem is?  Christian's depressed... but i cant really help at all... wish that i could.   Frances's friend, Grabriella(Lella) is sleeping over, and has been over all  day... those two are nuts together...and lella's such a sweetheart. So serious  sometimes... like when she was reminding my dad that she had to keep her  meal kosher... (Shes jewish) and watching a 7 year old do that is just so cute...  and then while frances was busy she curld up with me on the couch and we  read a few dr suess books. I want to keep her! lol.

      Kairsie, i absolutley love you sis! So happy youre home!  So yeah...umm... scary thought, going to prom with, gulp, Nixon. Yeah, that  sounds like reality at the moment...so yeah, if you know of a safer(and saner)  solution PLEASE let me know. ( if youre nixon reading this, its nothing  personal...youre just a flirt and a freshman .) So um yeah...scary thoughts.  Wordstock 2004 is on FRIDAY the 23!!!! wahhooooooooooo. ( lil excited,  can ya tell?)  so yeah, i get to play receptionist again this year, ( fun fun )  and i get to take mad pictures( even funner ) so i'm mega mega  happy-hyper about that. But understandable coming from poetry nut me.  ( gotta luv it ) um yeah... So funny, Nate is going to be the Lit Mag's  "most likely to break a bone during a meeting" member this year i thinketh....  He hit his left elbow on the chalk tray twice( hard enough to wince and roll  on the floor in pain ) and then hit his head on the filing cabinet( dont know  how that one happened ) while he was tracing a poster design for the  festival. Hes so great though. Sorta reminds me of a zanier verson of my lil Jamie...  who might i add, i would marry if he was 10 years older and i hadnt changed his  diapers. ( Jamie, not Nate ) but yeah...happy days. Hehehhe, best part  of friday...NO CLASS FOR MEEEEEEE ~_~   Song:  "Song of Silence" by Simon and Garfunkel  Emotion:  Content

      Its  really  funny to keep the freaking out best friend in bloody suspence. I could kill  someone for info about how Kairsie is and all i get is a email saying to call dave, and  he wasnt even answering the phone! So i Finally get ahold of him, and learn that the ENTIRE youthgroup who was at zion last night at least knew she was in the hospital,  and some knew more than that...and not ONE of you had the decensy to call me,  when at least 2 people there knew i was extremly worried about her! And another  one knew i was at least concerned!That is my big sister in the hospital we are talking  about! Grrrr.  So my day pretty much stank...between worrying about her and the phones that  NOONE answers whn i call about casey... and my paitings almost done, but not quite,  i have to run a mile tomorrow in in out lovely 85+ humidity weather, and i caught my  wrist on my locker door so it hurts like a ( enter good noun here ) Oh, and  i got about 2 hours of sleep last night total...and none of that was in a space of more  than 30 minutes at a time. On top of that add worrying about kairsie and school stuff...  and other friends having drama-trauma and you get one crappy day.

       It seems the world didnt stop on my not-so-broken heart.   but it might stop if Kairsie's life doesnt improve soon... she's really worrying  me right now... shes making comments about trying to kill herself again... and  i can't take that twice. I really cant. Expecially since this time i dont have  Daniel to help me. ( giving up on that one, but life moves on *sigh*).  Kairsie,  we love you. Really.  D&D was a lot of fun today...my charachter's deadly with a shortbow... havent  lost a hit point yet. Jeremy and Dave's charchters werent so lucky... but anywayz ...schools a pain, but isnt that always the case? Got to spend time with my  parents last night...went to lancaster, to a art show/benefit my mom's former  college roommate was holding for the prep school she owns...Art show, Celtic  concert ( ver ver cool ) and then Folk dancing after... i havent been to fold dancing  since i was about 10... it was funny trying to learn the dances, and remember  others...i got pretty good at the one...i didnt have to watch my feet anymore...  which is saying something as i'm a total clutz. but it was fun...we're going to  another one on the 22 of May...  finally seen Kill Bill 1... loved it... lotsa homework to do tomorrow...maybe go to YG,  dont know for sure though.... we'll see. And naturally, i still dont have a date for  prom... might ask Jeremy if he wants to go with me... AS A FRIEND. geez...people  actually think we should go out...how funny is that? Hes a cool friend...but i dont  know if i could ever see him as more than that... Whatever. about 2 months til  schools out. YAY.

      Another day gone by.  I could really go for a bowl of icecream about now... and a back massage, but hey, you live with what you got. Poetry Festival planning is going badly...about 30 people are expected total, unlike our normal 100+ turnouts...too much work for just me, Steph, and mrs mathews...and we're all getting stressed. But Missy and i are gettin to be pretty good friends lately...Amy's such a witch to her... it was funny when we were lamentaing covers today, suring the meeting...Angie came in, and was afraid to leave her coke open. Thus, Missy said  "Oh yeah, that's good. Just spill it all over the stack of lamentated covers so we have to start ALLL over again..."  We all allmost died laughing. But so yeah... if you happen to have a job lying around...i need one. i owe kairsie money, i have a cellphone bill to keep paid, and i dont even want to think about prom tickets. Like i figured, from past experiance, when Dave told me he asked Daniel to call me...He still hasnt. chances are wont. And i think i'm addicted to my new CDs... i listen to them constantly...not that thats a bad thing mind you, but my moms getting sick of them.

       A cute lil anecdote i found online... While taking a routine vandalism report at an   elementary school, I was   interrupted by a little girl about 6 years old.   Looking up and down at my   uniform, she asked, "Are you a cop?" "Yes," I   answered and continued   writing the report. "My mother said if I ever   needed help I should ask the   police. Is that right?" "Yes, that's right," I   told her. "Well, then," she   said as she extended her foot toward me, "would   you please tie my shoe?"

      Easter was Yesterday.    There was a large candle before me, but no matter how many times i tried to light it,  the match kept going out before the candle caught fire. I tired to shield it from wind, to  nurture it, but still it went out. No matter what i did, the flame went out, before i could light  that candle.   I saw Molly and Emily yesterday, at my Mommom's house...so big now! I goit this weird  dancing chicken toy from my secret pal at church, and Molly loved it. I had to sneek it into my  bag so it would leave with me. Buy the movie Brother Bear!!!! It is sooo great! and the  musics good too. And WOW 2004 is pretty good too, while i'm endorsing products. i got that  yesterday from my secret pal too...ver cool. The service at church was great, the Chancel  choir's second song they sang, had a c-flat trumpet(cute lil thing) and was utterly amazing. i  have NEVER heard them sing that well.  Club Worship was amazing... the stations upstairs, ver moving. everyone was a bt...i dont  know... different satuday night, than norm at least. At least, those that were there. It  wasnt the exact norm group on crew. But thats okay, right? New blood. ~_~  And of course Daniel wasnt there. He never is when i need to talk to him. And yes, Kairsie, i  did avoid answering that question. I will again too. And i know he's not going to call me, ven  though Dave was going to ask him too. (I could hug that boy, he's actually trying to help me h ere ~_~) But yeah...GRRRRRR. So if anyone knows of one of my guy pals, who doesnt mind  being dragged to the Wyo jr/sr prom in may, let me know...i'm looking for a "date."

I really hope they do... I'm spending more time with  Nada lately... but less with youth group and school pals... the trade off? who knows... college to find...scary. and driving...scarier.

      i slept into 11 again. someone call ripleys beleive it or not.  um, had a wee little fight with my mom the other day(kairsie, thank you so much) which has  resulted in the need for me to find a way to fix a digital camera... thats in pieces.  I have a painting to do in one week, plus history worksheet, cleaning, a movie day for all my  pals, well...most of them, not all were invited as my living room is rather small.... and i have  editing to do on a number of books   Okay, a pathetic and amusing and funny little story about saturday afternoon/ evening:  Kyle called me on his cell, because he was supposed to meet Christine at VF, but he couldnt  find her( go figure ) so we talked while he wandered around the place, which  included the food court. Now, as stories go, this one has some background info...here its that  because of the movie day friday, i've called the Eagers house a few times (5)  trying  to find out if Dennis and Daniel wanted to come. So when Kyle mentioned her was by Sweet  street, i figured maybe Nicky would know if they were home or on vacation etc. So,  duh ,  i asked him to ask nicky( while we're stil talking on the phone ) where daniel and  Dennis were. What i heard was along the lines of  "Hi, are one of you Nicky?" "Yes"  "Do you know if" he talks into the phone now, what are their names?" "Daniel and Dennis" "Do you know where Daniel and Dennis are?" "Daniel should be home right now" "She says Daniel's at home" "Who asked?" "Cat" And then Kyle ran away in embarrassment ( so brave ) So later, after Kyle'd found  Christine by rue21, and all that jazz, Daniel calls me, because( now i wasnt given any real  details or explanations ) but something along the lines of Nicky called Mrs Eager, flipping  out( no reason provided to me ) about me "sending Kyle to ask her about them" and  apparently Mrs Eager the called Daniel, and started flipping out on him about me "constantly  calling" their house and the Nicky incident. So while I didnt say anything as specific...I was  thinking it would have been alot easier for someone to either have answered the bloody phone ( so i only would have called once ) or tell someone when i leave a message with my  cell phone number ( like i did thursday before i left to babysit ) instead of just telling  your son that i "keep calling" but she didnt have my number to give him...   what an odd family.   oh yeah, and i added poems to "Written in Red Font" and "Essence"

Who are ya'll voting for? IF i could vote in  november, i'd be voting  Nader . Since i'm not 18 until  february, i cant thiough. but what are other peoples  votes? Senior talent(less) show tomorrow, and most 9th  to 11th graders are  boycotting  school after lunch, since  we've had our pool day taken away because of the senior  class's past behavior. Grr.

Trig review  friday third period and logorythms next week while the  seniors are taking finals. Literature test tuesday fourth  period. Prom sunday night... Art Major review and  critiques next week.  Hopefully  exempt from the chemistry  final...unless i bombed the test today or the worksheets  handed in today... Lets see...have to doublecheck euro,  english, and art for exemptions... yuck. Well... 2  definate finals isnt horrible... Could be much worse. You  know what i mean  Christine . Blah blah blah blah BLAH! i need a job!!!!! and a license  wouldnt hurt. hmm...better doublecheck when graduation is  this year...might go...maybe not... since  Ashley  wants   Daniel  and  Dennis  to go i might stay on the other side of  the seats.

       OUCH !!!!!!!!  Did you order the cat deep fried or extra crispy?  Kitty's   burnt to a bright red crisp and it hurts like a @$*&$#^%.  Melody's  birthday party was friday night and i went. We  discovered that  Krystal  and  Deanna  are horrible with  directions in the dark. And i discovered that  Mel's  friend   Amanda  is so randomly cool. And we learned that if  kitty's   in a pool without sunscreen for hours she gets burnt. lol. Actually...i have mild sun poisoning from it,  and  cant  bend my arms ver easily, but the  only  thing that hurts are  my shoulders. Oh yeah, and hangman's curse is a great  movie. And happy birthday  Mel !  I'm going to youth group tonight!!!! finally. I  was  going  to go to my prayer groups meeting at the Wiedners but  between sunburn and france's soccer game i cant. But its  all good anyway. I can put more aloe on this way ~_~  EEEEEk, proms next week. So i'm now  taking bets  on whether  or not the burn'll be gone by sunday night.  Steffy  thinks  yes. Me and  Phil  are betting on pinkness to class with my  dress. But honestly, as long as it doesnt hurt...i dont  really care. And  Phil, Dave  and  Jeremy ? any plans for the  29th? because can you say  D&D ? short notice yeah but hey,  its a day. if not i dont know when...maybe the 3rd  saturday in June... hmm... After a few minutes of discussion with  kairsie  i've decided  to add the unedited versions of posts for those who've... less than inspired me to christian acts. so check  "For the Curious"  for those if you care... i know  kairsie's  waiting  to read 2 of them in particular.

      Check out "  For the Curious  " and comment   as i add your names to the list. well, actually, only  comment if you want to. if i trashed you( which i  havent really done to anyone yet ) you might not want  to. But so yeah...i like it, and it has links to  practically everything i'v started...including th mad  cool  Essence  that nooo one bothers to read. But i  shall be fixing that, never fear.  Kairsie , go under  settings and turn on bolt commenting? you'll see it  pretty quick. i havent gotten my browser to let me  edit  that  particular blog yet. So yeah... The debate recently arose about whether  or  not i am a  bitch, and if so, just  what  qualifies as a bitch. Now  really, has there ever been any doubt on this subject?  Well, besides from the  swatara  crew who have not seen  me in action.So from what was said, i out bitch  Ashley  ( smurph aya ) and  kairsie , thus making me  The Bitch . Or  in another's words, the  Alpha Bitch . Now, at this point,  i was trying to figure out just how i was a bigger  bitch than those two, as they can both be pretty damn  vicious when they're on a roll. Apparently, to be a  bigger bitch, you have to be able to be sweet as sugar  when you want to be, and mean it. And cruel as Hell on  a hot summer day when youre crossed. Both of which, i  have been informed, are charachteristics of mine. So  now i'm designing shirts for me and my sister bitches.  They're hott. Yawn...updating sites is tiring. And i have to take mad  pictures tomorrow after school of the  art show ...and  upload allll the ones from  wordstock 04  still...that'll  take forever...not even counting the editing and  uploading them from the computer to the site... ughh.  i'm a slave to  evil technology . But so yeah...3 more  weeks of hell until i'm free. Hopefully next week i'll  get a call from the  Book Warehouse  saying they want to  hire me.  Kitty  needs a job. And  kitty  also needs people to stop freaking out when  she talks in the third person. Geez. its just a fun  quirk. She's not psycho. Lol. And  Kitty  also would like  for people to stop harassing her about dating. cough  cough you know who you are.  Kitty  is  not  going to date   Daniel  for obvious reasons. And  Kitty's  not sure she'd  date  Jeremy  for a number of reasons either. Lol. spazzes. Luv yeahs anywayz.    Song : "Outside the Fire" by Garth Brooks  Emotion : Dreamy

      New page added to the blogs  Last night was hell...after the whole mess with  sara ,   frances  started being a brat...and then  Dad  started  getting annoyed with  sara  mouthing off and crap, so  when he went upstaiors to check on her she still  hadnt done anything shed been told to, and he flipped ...broke the rail off the side of the bunkbed,  destroyed a bunch of my disks and jewelry in the  process after the wood bounced off the wall...  Sara   thought  dad  was going to kill her, and i was almost  positive. Sacred the shit out of me and  mom , though,  because it sounded like  sara  was attacking  frances   from the living room...and then it took me and nmom  to get  dad  out of our bedroom... logged on my phone  and vented to  Joel  for a few hours while i cried...He's such a sweetheart. I'm so sick of this bulll shit! i cant cant cant take  it anymore. And today they're acting like nothing  happened!  And then i ended up feeling like crap this morning so  i didnt go to school...so now i have to make up a  shitload of stuff... like an english test and notes on  hyperbolas for trig...Not to mention someone else had  to set up my stuff for the art show this means... feel  bad for them.  Come to the Art Show tues, wed, or thurs  from 6-9 pm at Wyo highschool...  I'm going to be there  wednesday night hopefully... sleep sounds good.... a shower sounds better. I think  i'll do both.

       My sister is such a goddamned little fucking obnoxious  piece of shit bitch    Sara , the psychotic little bitch attacked me today  again...she was pissed at  mom  because since she didnt  go into church she wasnt allowed to go to miniature  golf with her yg...well she decided to take it out on  me, and i told her( nicely actually ) to knock it off and  relax. She then proceeded to throw her purse at me, so  i chucked it out the door. So she through her shoes at  my head, and missed, so when i went to pick them up,  she jumped on me and started scatching me, pulling my  hair and trying to strangle me... So i knocked her  against the bunkbed, and smacked her upside the head to  get her off of me. Then she screamed at mom and stormed  out of the house. And i'm under orders to keep the door  locked until  mom  gets home, because  mom  doesnt want her  in the house. AND if she gets into any trouble while  moms gone, and gets escorted home, i'm to call  mom , and  stilllll not let her inside. And if she pulls anymore  shit,  moms  putting her in foster care.  Finally, my parents see the light. always threatening to,  but now they reallly are going to.Took 'em long enough.  But yeah.  Kairsie's  party was last night-so much fun,  even the part where all my car rides were doubled in  original time length... Kelly  missed the green hills exit  ~_~ lol. But we all had fun...and what was  Alex  thinking  using that lame excuse to get my number?  Kairsie's  not  stupid ya know! she def saw through that one. lol, people  so weird... Need sleepage...but i have to clean, and go  shopping with  mom ...although i'm not going to have  mexican with  Mel ,  Deanna , and  Casey  now...waaah. and i  havent been online in like 4 days( wow for me ) but i'll be  on tomorrow...yays. Screw cleaning... i need a nap.    Song:  "For the Girls" by someone  Emotion:  Pissed

      Evil blog format!!!!!  My first time using blogger since they change things  around...and i cant stand it!  grrr . But on the bright  side, my website is letting me update it again. But  the downside is my AIM is screwed up... has been since  some moron called me while i was online and it through  me off. that was monday night. Refuses to open AIM...  so i'm stuck using AIM express until someone can fix  my aim. which also mean dead aim wont work for me. grrrrrr.

      SPIRITUAL PARANOIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  ( For more info, check out  Kairsie's  blog ) So yeah...What the heck is   Dennis  thinking? Or rather, he clearly isnt. I mean come on! Hes only  20, and they havent even been going out for 6 months. Hell, he  doesnt even have his  license ! And he expects a marraige to work out?  Aye, so thats pretty much what this big thing was the  Kairsie  and   Dave  wanted to tell me in person. but GEEZ...this isnt 2nd grade  anymore...marriage now is real...( holds head, and shakes head ) I can't  beleive the people i know and have been friends with...they are such a  drama packed lot of freaks. And i'm just as bad. But anywayz,  Jen  was at CW, so it was kinda nice talking to her again...  Jason  is now Jason the Muggable. Hes such a weakling. Its sad. Girls can  beat him up so easy. And i  HATED  the part yesterday, when  Daniel ,   Dennis , and  Seth  showed up for a few minutes...and i got the emotional  slap in the face from realising i still like  Danie l, even though hes a pain in  the ass and  Dennis's  brother. Its not like it does me any good anyway  though... Itd never work out, and i really need to move on. But in the  words of oh so wise  Casey , it just dont work. I've been reading my copy of the book CUT again... forgot to heave it with   Kairsie  last night...oh well, she'll get to read it eventually.... Raided the  goldfish stash, but i'm hungry again...should prob be working on my  english essay for tuesday, but i dont want to...i'm enjoying just talking to   Joel  online quite a bit thank you ever so much.

For those that didnt hear yet, my youth group  finally  got a room of our own at church... which we started  repainting  today.

Anywho , lemme know when ya'll want to do other stuff. I'm game. Just keep in mind i'm watching the  youngest  sib for the summer.  And i'm going to the beach with  christine  on the 10th. just for the day, but it'll be fun. supposedly Phil's bringing  Darryll  as his guest. lol. and we have to put up with  Sarah D . and whoever she brings for part of the night. but thats fine. we dont  have  to spend much time with them  unless  we want to. And speakin of time, i should be wrappin this up wo go finish painting  my  project, so i can get some  sleepage  and get up at 7 to paint  tomorrow . yawn. and maybe beg mom for some of my pay to repay  kairsie  back. and maybe grab a pack of white paper plates to go to skateaway... ~ horrendiferous : amusingly atrocious    Song : "zerospace" by kideny thieves  Emotion : vexed

      Yawn, nothing like getting addicted to  sleeping  in later than norm. The earliest i have gotten up this summer was  7 20 . and that was one day. i average around 9. and i never sleep that late. But hey, this happens. Oh yeah... first trip to the  pool  yesterday( public wyo pool i mean ) The demons are painfuly  sunburnt , and ver unhappy about it. But that happens when they  dont  put on sunscreen when i tell them to. (i'm burnt on my lower back, where i couldnt reach to put more on). Sibs are such a pain in the ass.  Sara , mistress of demons, hellspawn and all that obnoxious crap, let the phone ring  all  day, so i missed 3 phonecalls. THEN when it started downpouring this evening, she left the side window in our room open, which just happened to be  inches  away from my notebook and paperback book i was reading.  Both  of which are drying out in hope they can be spared. They better be, because ihad poems in that notebook, and if i lost them because she let it get wet cause she's an inconsdiderate self centered little bitch i'm going to  maim  her. Oh yeah, and  Mom  went to a  Tim McGraw  concert last night without me. waaaaah. But she had fun, which is good.  But i swear my sister dows have a  split   personality ...because last night we had a chic fest of venting for like 3 hours... and we both  enjoyed  it. But 10 minutes afterwards she was a bitch again. there have to be 2 people living in her body. and i'm  not  talking demon posession, for those of you readers who are spiritually paranoid.  Yawn... People.  If youre gonna take the time to read my blog, do us both a favor, and leave a comment  about what you thought, things that have happened, if you think i'm a complete loser, etc...  Or  if you think i have insulted you during the course of a vent and want to give me a peice of your mind, thats cool too.

      ...because Dennis Eager is now  engaged .  Okay, in know the first thought half ya'll will have is youre just jealous cause he's your  exboyfriend . Nope, sorry luvs, wrong guess. I  just  think hes being a stupid little idiot. Well, not so little, but not so bright either. * sigh * i thought getting older made people  more  mature and smart. 'pparently not. 'Cause that lad is being about as immature as they come. Dont get me wrong, want him to be happy and all that  wishy washy bull crap , but really now-since when is it smart to get a marriage license  before  your drivers license? Never. Things you should have before you get married... a license, a house or apartment, a steady job that you wont get laid off from in a month, the support of your family AND friends, and, sad i know, how about enough time dating eachother that it doesnt look like a desperate  attempt  to recover from past wounds? Puhlease. At least i have one thing for the record.  Dennis , you may have said that the purple door deal proved just "how in  love  with me" you were...but at least i never made that same mistake. Good luck, God bless, and i hope you get a  prenuptial  agreement signed. ~_~  On another fron of the daily news, The countries of  Cat  and  Frances  have collided in a full scale war. More updates at 11. Lol. 7 yr olds think  they  rule the world. Now one seven year old knows that when you give your big sister attitude she  sits  on you. Literally. Aint called babysittin for nothin.  ^_~  But really, i think the neighbors think we're beating eachother, because the screams coming from house during the day are  nothing  short of blood curdling. That kids got lungs  almost  as good as mine. I hate when mom swipes the pc. I lost  all  of my pictures from after prom. and some  from  prom. waaaah. oh, and  2 chapters  of my story. I hate when she does this crap...she promised me it was all  backed   up . but it wsnt. it was an old back up file, and i've lost over  200  pictures i took because of it. So if you have prom pictures, or lit mag party pictures, or any other pictures from the  last month , send them to me? please? you know you want to.  And of course, boys  suck . Whether your name is  Dennis ,  Jeremy ,  Aaron ,  Daniel ,  Joel , or whatever, youre a bum. Go and just GRRRRR!

Cause our  yg  is having a game night...and it'll either be softball or indoor stuff depending on weather...and we'll have a  snack  ( cookies from what i've heard ). Its the church across from Wyo's  Walmart  ( first church of the bretheren, look for the tall bell caralon ).  Anywho , call me or whatev for detailamjigs.

      So i finally replaced my christmas present, the broken in half  kindney thieves  cd. Kinda sux now that i think about it... i mean... it took my like  6 months  to go back to best buy and exchange my store credit. But anywho, it doesnt really matter. Not like anyone cares.  Oh yeah, and my  revelation  for the day: No One reads this besides  Kairsie . So what's the point? I'm just taking up web space. Can you tell i'm in a pissy mood? Let you in on a  secret , i was in a good mood until about an hour ago. And then someone mentioned they were trying to find  another  job. Thanks for the reminder that i  dont  have a god damn job and havent had one for the  3  years that i've been trying to find one. Now, if youre  done  rubbing my pennyless face in the dirt, will you  shut up  and  quit whining  that the job you already have isnt perfect? At least you have one. I dont. And when youre broke, over the summer, it really sux ass.  And  dont  start on me about my swearing. I've been a good girl lately, and  Kitty's  just  slightly  annoyed at the moment. I mean, i put up with a lot of shit from people, because they're my friends, or family. And it's really really fucking  annoying . GET OFF MY CASE. or better yet, find something  constructive  to tell me. Because " Cat , you're a bitch" and " Kitty , you have an attitude problem" really dont do much beside piss me off. GRRR.  And while we're at it, a few key members of the male sub species can go throw  themselves  off a cliff please. End of all my problems, clean and simple. Since  i  always have to think up my own solutions, along with everyone elses. I'm gonna go upstairs and write poetry about  murdering  everyone. If i like it, you may even read it some day. Until then,   Go to hell  .    Song:  "Black bullet" by Kidney Thieves  Emotion:  Pissed

      No sisters until thursday  I am entitled to be happy!!!!!!! GRRRR! but now  i'm getting sick thanks to  sara ...she was sick  last night. got better just in time to go to  camp today( woulda made her go anyway ) and now i  want to hurl.  Hate  when that happens.  Expecially over the summer. just not fair.  Oh yeah, and just to set the record straight.  I was at club worship  last  night. not  next  month.  Lol. the things that get mixed up...  Oh yeah, anyone who's been in the  d&d  game  since ...last summer, if you want to check your  calenders for the  26th  of this month... maybe we  can get another day in of gaming. maybe see how quickly  "fifi"( infiel ) can run away from an ax  weilding thug who shall remain nameless...  On top of it all... I hurt. and its not even just  the physical pains of a bruised ankle or  reinjured wrist. its that tight ache at the base  of the throat, and that curled tightness in the  chest... everytime i see  Him  and fall under  his   spell... or when i dont talk to  Him  for days to  weeks at a time... But i'm so physically  attracted to  him ... and i think a little  emotionally and mentally. But on the other hand  theres another guy, who i quite honestly think  i'm slowly falling in  luv  with... But how can  i be so completely drawn towards one guy... and  care so deeply about another miles away? And i  know so many people think  him  and i are totally  wrong for eachother and that it would never work  out... and i also know people think  he  treats me  like crap and has ver lame excuses for not  dating me... but at the same time  he  can be so  sweet, and funny, and and fun and strong...not  to mention a complete flirt. But on the other  hand  He  lives states away from me, and doesnt  know when, or if,  he'll  ever be here. Yet  he's   so understanding and funny and we can talk for  hours about nothing and enjoy it. But both of  them have made me cry before...despite their  ability to make me smile... One leads me on and  the other tells me not to wait. What to do...and  can anything take this ache away? Do more than  two people have any clue what this Hell is doing  to me? Or should i just turn away....  Have a Great Summer    Song:  "Land of the Living" by Pam Tillis  Emotion:  Resentful

It was loud, full of rythm, ( the bass player's bass had  5  strings  kairsie  !) and um.... there were only like 30 odd people there so it was like having a  private  concert. It was so cute though... they gave their  drumsticks  to this cute lil  3 year old  who then played on the floor with them during the second half of the concert. It was  sooooo  adorabibble. Oh yeah, and people... you should have been at  kairsie's  yesterday to help me,  Rachel , and her pack up stuff. (  kitty : not another &nbsp;penny!!!!!)( kairsie : not another flip flop!!!!!)  so yeah...  aaron's  a bumb cause he had to clean his room. ( loser ) and yeah... i'm getting a new  couch  today.  Ohhhh. And i'm not  Kitty  today. I'm  Andrea .  Kitty  will be  returning  to take posession of her body  tomorrow  morning. Until then-deal with the  lack  of pastels in my appearance. Buh Byez.

      So yeah, been a few days since i posted on here. 2 days of fun actually.  Saturday  my sunday school class ( plus  christine  and  gayle  ) went to  Ocean City NJ  for the day instead of going to the church  picnic , or, in the case of  Phil  and I, working at  club worship . I hear i missed some excitment-like a quick set up, and  Daniel  and  Ashley  both being there. But i had my own set of fun.  Sarah  and  Gayle  made a sand castle that  disolved  into nothingness. I got barely any sunburn, and me and  christine  did some  shoppin' . Oh, and then there was the part where i almost got my ears peirced again  without  permission, and the part where my godfather turned lobster  red , and the events of mega  hot  men in uniform patrolling.  ~_~  I now own flip flops for the first time in  12  years. How pathetic am i. well, yeah, bought flip flops, velcrow cool sandals, and a thumb ring. aint i just  spwecial . Oh, and we learned a valuable lesson. The ride home from the beach is 3  Wierd Al  CDs long.  Yawn, so then yesterday i went to  Zion's  service/yg at esh's meadow. I "snuck into"  Kairsie's  house while she was in the shower. And i got yelled at for  not  making any noise. Hehe. But the day wasnt too bad...Excluding the evil  bluegrass  worship music. But yeah  Dave ,  Kairsie ... Lord of the Dings. Mega water  craziness  broke out between people. And a few of us stole  Kelly's  blanket... Sorry for hitting you with my flip flop  Dave ! lol.  Daniel  saved me from getting dropped in the  creek . But almost got my  pushed  in anywayz when he attackes  Scott . Lol. No rant about that boy today... ive accepted that i'm just a  temproraily  amusing piece of ass and i'm just going to smile, cry, and tell myself how  stupid  i am to like him. ( not that i listen to myself ) Yawn.  Jeremy  showed up for YG,  Aaron  didnt. ( you will suffer now platinum ) And we had a dam building contest. Ours won most funcional...cause it was. The run off  rocked . and  Gabby's  boats... and  mel's  shoes which were part of the foundation... lol. Oh, and  Jaron ,  Gabby  and I made a new game. You spin the big swing and drop  jaron's   hat  on the ground. then you try to pick it up the most( 11 for me ) But now i have to wash his hat cause its  yucky. ~_~  Loved our ride home chat  kairs . But now its given me lots of new things to think about. Well, check out and  comment people. or i'll stop commenting on your blogs.    mistakes become clearer /after the fact/now when you pick up the pieces/but you cant make fit/dont waste all your time /trying to make sense of it/whats done is done/dont go on believing/ youre the only one/ weve all got something/ wed like to forget/ we all need someone/ to echo our fears/ take a deep breathe/ and life goes on  did you really think last night would last forever/ did you really think that guy hung the moon/ right now you hate yourself cause you knew better/ but theres no use crying over spilt perfume.

      So yeah, my sister is so gonna get  strangled  if she keeps bein this obnoxious lil brat. So  instead  of getting thrown in  jail , i went  kairs's  last night while everyone was recording with  Alex  and helped her get her clothes all organized for package. And  Jesse , for your info i dont give weak hugs! I only had one available arm so there * sticks out tongue * I swear those peices of fabric were  breeding  little bandannas or something. The closet's pile was as tall as  Kitty !!!! And if something had tried to  eat  me from that chaos of coverings i wouldnt have been allowed to scream cause of recording downstairs. ( like that would have really stopped me ) But so yeah, i stepped on a fake  christmas tree  and almost got lost in  Kairsie's  room. And theeeen me and kairs went outside and were admiring the view of playing the chello in the drivers side front seat of a car.  Ver  amusing.  And whats this?  kairsie  is the queen of pranks? Lol. Shes the number one  suspect  from the thursday night  TPing .  Mel  is number 2. Hahaha. And  kitty's  posting new poems... Oh and  Aaron . Hehehehe.

      If you dont get it, you obviously didnt watch 10th Kingdom. Lol. But anywho, that is so my new phrase after watching that 6 1/2 hour movie. Lol, but they had elves with wings. So not right. Then again, its like the rip off of every fairy tale ever written in the western world. and ver cool. So yeah, apparently Nada has acousin nicole who was visiting her yesterday so she "couldnt come over" and since "we're not that tight anymore" it was better than me. Pff. Like hell. Nada needs to get a life and stop lying. She was invited over yesterday, and didnt bother. If thats my fault, which we all know it isnt, who cares. Oh, and Ashley finally invited me to her going away party, which i had heard about, but it turns out that its on sunday-4th of july. Like i'm going to be allowed to go? Laughable. Expecially considering i have 2 days notice. But anywho...My sister tried to kill me yet again today...my arms are still stinging from it, and that was around noon. I mean geez, She's such an annoying, self centered, obnoxious, spoiled, arrogant, violent, two faced, bitch. And i got told to stop starting fights with her! hello! I got hit on the head, punched in the neck, my arms are covered in little bloody crescent nail marks, i had temporary double vision, and lines cut into my arms, and my mom is yelling at me for my sister's two buite marks and one scratch. PUH-LEASE. I'm the one who lost the fight. That she started. And i'm getting bitched at? i dont bloody think so. I spend most of my week mopping, sweeping, picking up after a certain little brat, fighting with her to get her chores done, keeping an eye on her, making lunch, putting away videos, attempting to work on summer assignments, and when do i get a chance to actually write, or edit, or hang out with my friends? I plan 2 weeks for yesterdays group of people, and then today i get the shit beaten out of me, and the bitch gets to go to the pool! What the flying fuck? But yeah, yesterday was fun. Watched Armageddon... had the power go out all along penn ave, including my block... played frisbee at the park, mooched gelati off Dave and Kairsie, got silly string at the mall, had an adventure that was actually a short cut... It was all good. And if someone has heard of the lkocal christian rock band Kurious, please let me know!!! I'm prob going to their concert on the 17th and would appreciate an opion on their music!!!   Song: "Anything Goes" from Anything Goes Emotion: Hurting

      Just got home today from  camping  all week. Hehe, think i confuzed  Steph  monday morning when i went in to buy  milk . lol. But so yeah, its been an interesting  6  days. Monday morning we( my parents, sisters, godparents, and their two kids ) drove up to  knoebals  to camp for 2 days. Spent the first night at the  pool , the second day in the  park . My  godmother  got the  brass  ring. But the rub in is the part where i  missed  it. But oh well. We had fun even if i did want to  strangle  my sisters  after  the car ride. Seriously though,  dont  spend a week with a preteen and a thirteen year old if you can humanly help it. Yawn, and then we went up to  Mauch Chunk Lake Park  to go camping for the rest of the week. Yuck. I  normally  dont care about bugs and spiders.  But  the ones up there were  huge . Oh yeah, and we went  rafting  too. 8 miles on some river i didnt catch the name of. it was sooo  easy . I went white water rafting in  colorado ... this one had barely  any  real challene. But yeah... got back around 4 30 this afternoon... and i'm  mad  tired.  Call me  if you want to go  shopping  some time this next week( after 4 cause thats when i'm done babysitting ) I need to get out  without  my family...  And  let me know when its good for me to have my next movie  day ... WYO  people, do you know if we go back on the  30th ? lemme know!

       But i'm  leaving  again tomorrow morning to go camping for the week with my  family  and my  godparents , and their two children. This could be a very  interesting  week. But anywho, back to my last week or so...   I had a week of drama camp at  Swatara . Youth Musical to be precise.  Kim B, Kim L, Christian, Kyle S, Kyle R, Heather, Gina, Travis, Chris, Haley, Molly, Mike, Sarah S,  and  Joy  were all there again. And we had some newbies this year...  Sarah T, Kahlem, Breanna , and  Lainna ... It was a good week. ( sorry to anyone i missed i'm  reaaaaaally  out of it today ) Of course there were some  little  problems in paradise this week... I got a bit annoyed when i found out  Kim'd  lied to me back in august about going to  Christian's  mom's wedding... the two of them got annoyed at me because  they  thought i was following  Christian ... I got irked at  constantly  cleaning up everything after meals... But  besides  that everything was pretty cool.    Our  Gabriel  rocked...  Kahlem  has a great voice and how many angels have a  mohawk ? lol.  Kim  and i were  spies/voices  and manhandles  Phil ,. who was our inkeeper. I killed  Kim L . lol. ( our play was rock nativity by the way ) So yeah... all of our voices were shot after 8 days of singing... and half of us have  hot tea  for blood... but it was a lot of fun. And i gained a few new friends through it.    Well, that and a few new ideas about my  religion . A few weeks ago i told  Kairsie  that i dont consider myself a  christian . But after some of the bible  discussions  we had this past week... i think that i am one. Maybe i'll let you know more later...    And i'll be taking my  cell phone  with me this week when we go  camping ... but it'll prob only be on at  night  and when we're at  knoebals ...i dont know if i'll have  reception  in the poconos. We'll see. Well, gotta go... Miss you guys much!!! (   happy birthday  Darryll )     Song : "Friends in Low Places" by Garth Brooks  Emotion : Exhausted
