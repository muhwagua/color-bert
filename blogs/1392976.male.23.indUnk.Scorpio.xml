      Man, once I get settled in at Iowa, and if I have any spare time (if all goes according to my evil plan I will) I'll be starting up the Iowa City extension of North Shore Brewery.  Of course, there aren't really any shores around there, except for the Coralville Reservoir, but that's alright.  I know a bunch of people out there already who like a good beer, or many good beers, and could probably very easily be convinced to join in the brewing.  In fact, the first drink I had when I went out to visit was a home-brew, and pretty good too, although I didn't the fine artisan who concocted it.  It was still not as good as the NSB chocolate stout, or the Smashing Pumpkin Ale that I loved so well, but it was good.  We need to get together and make some POWER-LLAGER, or possibly PILSNER-LLOYD.  Perhaps when this whole stupid college thing blows over, and all of us (me, Chris, Mark, Pete and Noah) live together and have a rockin' band, which would be even more amazing than the Traveling Wilburys for its amalgamation of rock geniuses, and me.  Well, now I've strayed from the topic of beer, the first of many more to do so on this blog, I'm sure.  But of course, beer and rock are inseparable, like strands of thread that intertwine to form a rope, a rope that binds us all together, even though we are distant geographically.  Wow, that was deep.  I need a beer.  - posted by jason

      chris this is a novel idea!!!!  we must grow hops out side of the murder shed at the entrance or something.  well i started my beaux brew (strawberry blonde) man it was vomiting up so much and after transfer i was left with only about 3 gallons but it seems it will be a solidly great beer.  anyway i had a brilliant idea.. we should brew a beer almost entirely on the beach for a super summer ale or something.  so wow the electric and water actually works in the murder shed!!! Wow  well anyway love ya guys  peace  mark

      chris you got all the equipment  for allgrain brewing?  if so sweet then maybe this summer we can do some all grain brews and save some cash  oh yeah sarah talked her father in to starting up brewing again since he is retiring  he used to brew but then the wife was complaining tomuch but sarah convinced him and he went out and bought new Equipment  .... sweet huh? hopefully we'll be sharing resipes and stuff anywho hope the red goes well  peace   oh yeah so our vending machines dont have root beer so i desided to ask on of the vending guys and he said he didnt do drinks but if i leave a message on the machine they should be able to stock it so here is the letter i left:   Could you please stock one of our machines with Root Beer?  Root beer is a traditional beverage which has been enjoyed for many, many years and in recent times me and my fellow colleagues have been noticing the decline in popularity of this traditional beverage. We at NCSA (school of design and production) like to hold on to our traditional roots hence this humble request.  Thank you greatly  -	School of design and production    posted by mark

      So I've decided my search for the perfect girl is over.  the other day i relized i dont need the girl next door (or any girl for that matter) to make me happy.  all i need is a toothbrush and a bar of soap. I am free.

      I went back to borders last night and talked to that girl again.  she told me the book iwas buying was great (Fight Club) and did it have anything to do with my black eye. i told her the story about peter using me as a punching bag and that we watched the movie one too many times.  she said i would love it (and i did,read it all last night) and another book by the same author "choke".  so after all this discussion instead of asking to buy her some coffee or something so we can further this conversation i say thank u, goodnight and walk away. SON OF A BITCH!   ahhhh...  help  I finnaly saw identity. i have to say not cusaks best film, maybe i would have been better off seeing the lizzie maguire movie.

      The first rule of Fight Club is   you do not talk about Fight Club while drunk  .  you will get a black eye. lil' petey, skulltise and me were drunk at eds house and peter punched me in the eye while i was eating terriaki beef jerky, it was really pretty funny (not as funny as noahs last blog entry, although no matter how drunk i am i wont go near poo).  other funny things have happened as a direct result of watching fight club the first was the first time i saw it mark was drunk on my couch and couldnt get up to move his car blocking jays so i decided  "hey i can drive stick" ( ididnt know the first thing about driving stick) i rumage through marks poket, his keys and electric tape fall out and what does he reach for?.... his electrical tape and then he howls and mutters something about rugby chicks (well rugby chick, that was a diffrent story).  i go out to marks car get it started stall about 4 times and cant get it into reverse so jays trying to help sticks his head in the door just as i hit the gas and smack the door hits his face.  the other funny thing is a skulltise story he tried to start his own fight club behind the skool and it was broken up by a bunch of bike cops with little bicycle shorts because some kid told his mommy(see the first rule of fight club!).  skulltise ha ha ha " these are most deadly scorpians ive ever seen"

      So im at borders the other day (umm..yesterday) and im paying for this really nice hard cover copy of "slaughterhouse five".  the cashier was this totally cute girl must have been about 20, strawberry blond, shoulder lenght hair and blue/green eyes, perfect for me(am i shallow?).  so we talk for about 15 miniutes about vonnegut and hard cover verses soft cover (i like hard cover so did she) and kosinsky.  it was probably the best and most intellegent conversation ive had with a girl in over a year(probably since high skool)...but i totally wussed out what the hell i used to be sooo smooth and able to ask girls out and stuff, what happend ? well i need work i guess ive been out of the game for too long i need practice but.....well aahck.                i was looking at the paper yesterday and i noticed that the lizzie maguire movie beat out the new john cusak and ray liotta (im not sure i spelt liotta correctly) movie. who would want to go see "lizzie maguire" rather than "identity" well she is kinda cute.......iguess i just answered my own question, dammit! why do i have to be such a dirty old man.

I was thinking about going to key  west.  it sounds good to me maybee disapear in september and stay that way untill next spring. grow my hair, a beard. yeah that sounds good just me, a back pack and a tent. i think it beats working 7am - 6pm daily or checking myself into a mental institution.          On the other hand maybee i should start going to sexaholics meetings to pick up chicks....or maybee i read too much

                 yeah i heard something really stupid this morning on the radio, there is a plan to make a film version of the brodway musical "hairspray".........I'll leave it at that. This weekend there was much disscusion on theme drinking the basic concensus is, for it (i know i am).  the definition of theme drinking differs depending on who you ask. Mark says its theme based on the actual drink such as fodys and nighttrain night.  peter says its like toga or pirate night.  the way i see it is you should have it both ways if you dress like pirates you should drink grog or rum, if your drinking nighttrain you should dress like guns and roses. but im for pajama partys corny as it sounds i like to get blitzed in my skivies. some people dont need an excuse to drink however a good flask hidden in your jaket while taking finals or at work is always a great way to go.  I want to recomend a great movie actualy two. the first "Boondock Saints" about two irish boys who go after russian and itailian gansters, the second "Secritary" with james spader.  most people think its sick, i think its increadably romantic.

      Man peter must really hate me, first he gives me a black eye (see earlyer blog) then he scratches the hell out of my car.  after a long night of drinking noah drives my car and im in the passinger seat (cause im fucked up) were on our way to a party at eds house (always at eds house does wackyness ensue) all of a sudden petes face in in my windsheild  "were the fuck did he come from? " we were driving about 30mph for christs sake. so noah starts swearving and i start spraying his ass down with washer fluid.  his muddy feet left all sorts of marks, oh well it needed a good detail any way (besides i got him back the next night by grinding the gears in his hyundi wagon) mmmmm........boooze  what a great weekend it was it was like a mini bocoach reuinun at eds house skulltise, whitey, noah and ed wow.  and then mark shows up with this cute korean chick from collage, it was just like old drunken times, yeah. and me and noah sang at kareoke(?) summer o' 69 and just like heaven (needless to say we were housed) it was great.

Two movies to watch "Prophecy" with viggo mortenson as the devil, awesome portrayal (I need not mention christopher walken's performance in this movie it speaks for itself).  the second movie "Pirates of the Carribien" johnny depp is a great pirate also not to mention this movie has pirates, zombies, monkeys, monkey pirates, zombie monkey pirates and zombie pirates. if you put robots somewhere in there it would be sooo sweeeet.

       This is in response to an old log entry of adams    www.tweebiscuit.net/deutschland  I was reading his travelblog and i couldnt help but feel saddened by the way he feels about L.I..  why, because i used to feel the same way, kinda.  i used to think that the stripe malls and the housing developments are ruining the nice liittle town of s.w.r., however my love for long island was renewed a few months ago.  this was done quite simply.  i took a walk.  i got up one morning and started walking, seven miles in total.  the strip malls and the develoupments kinda melt away when you walk past the woods on 25a across from the high skool and before shop lift us plaza.  even then at shoplift us plaza the nostalgia kicks in.  all the times spent walking or riding bikes to shoplift us, buying candy or cooler ranch doritos, ben and jerrys ice cream and then going back to miller place park (not always the one at the elementary skool) and eating enjoying myself with jay or mark or pete or andy. so i guess what im trying to say is adam take a walk enjoy the view.  it may not be the old ruins and 19th century feel tour looking for, it may not be dresden but this is the place i love.  oh and by the way pan ou chocalat is excellent and i hated my trip to france in ninth grade.

       I want to start a rock and or roll band....  if you are intrested or know some one who is let me know via e-mail.  must like cursive, the cure, the pixies, mavin gaye, and smashing pumpkins.    i wanna rock! rock!  or if you know any planning to book a show let me know i have some solo stuff i would also like to do.   on another note...i got invited to a movie premire by some bartender chick (this is probibly not gong to happen since im talking aboot it) that would make me very excited.  yeah so im missing a cursive concert tonite for my moms b'day but what can you do ill have to wait for next time.  happy birthday mom (she doesnt read this,but whatever).   i went to the city saturday i hate the city. i love the city. the reason for my hating it is im slightly agoraphobic (fenetik spellin) the reason for my liking it is the wierdness - such as the korean bbq where you have to cook your own food, this is funny to me because i was watching the college girls whe never cooked before in thier lives trying to see if the chicken was cooked all the way through. I ordered something that was already cooked - im not paying 20 dollars to cook 5 dollars worth of cube steak my self.    i have to scrap the first chapter of my book it sucks.

      I just took two tests one line, an IQ test and an inkblot test.  the iq test revealed i have a 115 iq idont know what that means does that mean im stupid or does that mean im smart for not really caring or believing in it.  the fact is i took it because i am currently bored at work.  The ink blot test says im powered by my sexuallity and im intense....bull shit.    I was very sad on friday to hear about the passing of Johnny Cash and John Ritter.  but what kind of upset me more was the coverage John Ritter got on tv (i know this because i spent all weekend watching tv, this girl stood me up, no harm no foul) Johnny cash only got his video for "hurt" played on vh1.  i wish i could have seen more.  well i gotta go cause my meaztball parm hero is here. sweet.  oh oh oh i changed formats tell me what you think  cgrantirish@aol.com

       a realization;          Congrats to jay and marrisa on thier new appartment in dc. it sounds great and im really excited for them...however with their move i am left with but one friend on long  island (that actualy hangs) this makes me very sad.  on a nother note jon k. has inspired me to write poetry again.  as i havent writen poetry for the sake of poetry since high skool (some of you may remember me carry a book of my really bad poems and lyrics) so heres one tell me what ya tink.  lost in all smoke and mirrors, our selves peaking through my window, barging through my door another drink to pass the night i never thought i'd be here holding on to night smoke and mirrors, we never knew  broken bones, poison ivy a week goes by.

       Is  Max Shreck  behind the california recall?  I was watching   Batman Returns   last week and the plot kinda reminded me of the headlines i keep reading on newsday.com (not the articles though, i cant read them...i'm lazy).  the evil Max Shreck as played by Christopher Walken tries to get a recall on the mayor of Gotham City. he uses The Peguin's (as horribly potrayed by Danny DeVito) celeberty status to launch a campaign to use him as a puppet.    Do you think that Batman will come and save californa from a sick and vengeful plot to kill all the first borns as implemented by   The Garry Coleman?

       I have a bacon chedder cheese burger on the way..  i can hardly stand the wait.  lunch is probibly the most importent time of my day (besides miller time and by miller time i mean time to go home). unfortunatly the only three places we can order lunch from is deli, italian and chines. but my fellow employee has a fear of getting the sars from the chines food.  so this limits us to the two. and on fridays we cant have italian cause another fellow employee's wife makes italian. so thats that. if i dont have potatoes every day i dont know what ill do.  hey anybody else think its wierd that ten years later jacko is accused of child molestation again.. urlLink jacko  is wierd i mean mike think about it huh.  i guesse yall can tell that im bored at work sometimes so, help give me some suggestions of what i can do at work to keep me occupied and out of trouble..

      the funniest thing happened to my friend from work. ben went to get a hair cut and his usual barber was packed, so he decided to try a new place in queens.  when he entered the establisment he noticed it was only other men,  after asking for aa trim they seated him right away.  he sat down and a light went on in the mirror....it was a two way mirror with scantaly clad women on the other side wow he thought, thats wierd and gross and arousing all at the same time.  just as the barber was done he heard a racket coming from out side then all of a sudden the cops bust in, in a raid.  ben politley asked a cop if he could go, the cop said "kid ya just got a free haircut"  man what a boring weekend i did absolutly nothing....well i wrote 2 half songs so i guess being traped without a vehicle isnt too terible.

      interesting weekend friday night an excellant rock concert (jon k and otmop) wow, unfortunatly no booze at the wading river congrigational church.    sat night after a night of free drinking i made out with someone (no names) im not sure i shoud have but really enjoyed. it was over due.  then someone else (again no names) calls me to come over and have sexuall relations, some one i really shouldnt be having these relations with, during our phone conversation (i dont know what i said - i was hammered) i said excuse me while i vomit so i run (naked) to the bathroom.  unfortunatly i dont make it and puke all over the floor and slip in it landing on my naked ass, horrible.  this wakes up my parents and as im locked in my bathroom my mother cleans up after me.  did i mention it was 3:45 am.  how embaressing.

         Between vomiting over the fifth floor balcony and in ice buckets (pete), drunken scale train rides, lying on the beach drinking coco loco's, breakfast shots of tequla, and  storming the clubs of puerto vallarta.... a good time was had by all.  my only regret was the complete lack of decent beer all corona type beer.  and no where could a wisky sour be found. i got a cowboy hat and a cuban cigar.    even though im back at work and in the cold, im looking foward to every thing.... playing on feb 13th, watching jonk and otmop jan 16th,  getting the split seven and split cd completed and if i have time work on my novel.  to paraphrase jonk this is the year of getting shit done, progress, creativity and emotion.     text from an e-mail noah sent me entitled "another reason to move to ireland"   the difference between the reaction to the smoking ban in ireland and  new york: "Some pubs in rural areas are flatly refusing to curb their smokers'  habits. An amazing 75% of landlords in Co Mayo have voted to ignore the  ban in their pubs."  "'This is Ireland', said Jonathan Byrne. 'In our laid-back culture, we  don't get upset by things like smoking. Maybe it's appropriate in  California and New York-but in laid-back Ireland, it goes against the  grain.'"           check out the new link  urlLink KNIGHT

Today's Date: Feb. 13   Scorpio 10/24 - 11/21  Social events, perhaps business-related, could put you into touch with people in fascinating fields, or perhaps from foreign countries, dear Scorpio. Logical thinking and a philosophical attitude enhance your communicative gifts, so people are likely to be drawn to you to hear whatever it is you have to say. Some important contacts could be made. Make sure to exchange business cards and take down notes. This evening might be a key moment for future plans.   yeah whatever...

      me and mark were talking about power-lloyd last night and if we ever were to have a reunion that during the show there should be some kind of proccess going on in the backround (or in power-lloyd's typical sense in the foreground) to this i replied (and until that moment did not remember) "hey man remember that show at the library when we made bread, that was fucking good bread man."   wow there were some good power*lloyd shows....like the time at the vision theater when jay destroyed a keyboard or the time i almost destroyed jay at the "death to margarine boy" show  we need more rock --- jay, mark move back to the island this is a plea from a brother   oh i updated the  urlLink news  page....kinda well it kinda looks like this one only orange wich it always did but know it has my e-mail and more links (instead of the one that just goes back to this page)  so check it out at your leisure.......

      this fat bastard is telling me how to diet; pepole are so fuckn dumb.....   Dr. Robert Atkins, whose popular diet stresses protein-rich meat and cheese over carbohydrates, weighed 258 pounds at his death and had a history of heart disease, a newspaper reported Tuesday  Before his death, he had suffered a heart attack, congestive heart failure and hypertension, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing a report by the city medical examiner.  Atkins would have qualified as obese, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's body-mass index calculator...    i think we would all be better off listening to little richard simmons...i mean the atkins plan goes against every thing we learned in health class....mutha fuka

      Text fom an e-mail:   > IDIOT SIGHTING:  The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it's safe to  cross the street. I   was crossing with an intellectually challenged  coworker of mine when she   asked if I knew what the buzzer was for. I   explained that it signals  blind   people when the light is red. Appalled, she  responded, "What on earth are   blind people doing driving?!"     now this reminded me of a trip i took with peter to visit noah,  we went into downtown hampshire to find booze and such now we came to like a center of town i guess and we had to wait for a buzzer to cross, but it wasnt like normal cross the street crossing it was a free for all...people were crossing diagnaly and zig zaggy..total kaos...my what a strange occorance that i  almost  forgot...

       Today's Date: Mar. 2   Scorpio 10/24 - 11/21  Make your dreams a valuable tool for insight, dear Scorpio. In days past, great rulers and kings believed so strongly in the insight their dreams carried that they employed interpreters. Whether you think dreams are mystical insights, or the result of random firings of your brain's release of thought and emotion, there is much to be gained. Recurring dreams hold much significance, as they can point to something that needs to be taken care of. Consider exploring this area.   Ive been having very vivid dreams lately, last night i dreamt about a ghost in my house that had drowned and she was scaring the shit out of me but my sister kept saying that we had to help her...and i cant remember how but we did and she got worse...  having these dreams is really freaky there so real and i havent  dreamt much in the last few years  song of the day "at last" - Etta James movie of the day "the gate" - starring Stephen Dorff album if the day "music to make love to your old lady by" - Mike Patton

      	I start out the night with two lines of Aderol baby blue like a bad tuxedo; Max cuts the pills on a dirty old railing in his mod .  It felt like snorting a pixie stick.  Since it was my first time doing this the only education I had on how to snort drugs with a hundred dollar bill was ?21 jump street? some episode where Peter Deluise had to do coke in a high school sports equipment locker, thank you fox network.  I don?t know I just can?t figure out this whole college thing right now I should really be focusing on that game of assassins that?s currently underway.  There?s only a few nights left in the semester.  Assassins is this game we play on my campus were you get  to assassinate a fellow student with a water pistol.  Last night I dreamt we started really killing people?

       In January, University of Utah hospital surgeons removed half the skull of Briana Lane, age 22 and unemployed, in order to save her life after an auto accident, but because putting the skull back in place was not quite an emergency, it was delayed by negotiations over cost. The skull remained in a freezer for three months, with Lane battling serious pain (and wearing a plastic helmet for protection, feeling her brain "shifting" on her) while the hospital negotiated with the state Medicaid office, which pays only for long-term "disabilities." Her skull was finally reattached on April 30.

Got to play at one of our all-time favorite venues, the Barrymore Theater. Checked in with the    "Wayback Machine"    site to find our old set list on tmbg.net (is that site gone?!) from the last time we played in Madison and was excited to see most of our set is different from a couple of years ago. Even more new new songs tonight and some new old songs (Stomp Box!) which was an exciting challenge.      hAs someone stole my band name pre-emptivly
