       Porn movies:    Disclaimer: These aren't actually that funny, but I find them amusing, so there.  I'm going to try and keep this original, not use any I've already heard before, but if I do subconciously do this, I apologize.   Week of 5 December 2003:   Sk.W.A.T. ( or if you prefer  S.C.A.T.).

       Porn movies 2:    So, Elydian tells me that the porn movies suck, and I have to agree with him.   Most  of them suck.  So I've editted my earlier submissions, and resolved only to make entries when they're actually funny, or good.   Food movies:    To that end, I was looking for something to fill these pages up, and I came across a list of things I had when I used to browse the  empireonline forums .  Basically the idea's the same as the porn movies, only with food instead.  They're not much funnier than the porn movies, but I like them.    To view the original food movie thread (and there are some good ones in there),  click here .

       50 ways to amuse yourself whilst dining out     In the middle of placing your order scratch yourself and sigh like it's the biggest relief you've felt in years. For bonus points inform the waiter taking your order that that 'feels  so  much better'.   Order your food in French, unless you're in a French restaurant, in which case order in Italian.   Get your partner to place your order. Sit silently, staring at your napkin throughout, until he/she asks for a side order. At which point look up and start shouting the name of the side order like an exciteable five year old. ie: 'Side Salad! Side Salad!'   Place your order by acting out the food. Bonus points for acting like cheese.   Wear a 'Meat is murder' t-shirt (or similar), and look disgusted when your partner orders a steak. Tut loudly, and then order the veal.   Order a bottle of house red and a bottle of house white and mix them in the same glass. Swish your concoction round your mouth a bit and, thinking for a moment, ask the waiter if they have any rum.   Burn things with the candles whenever the waiter is near. Bonus points for burning the menu whilst he's taking your order.   Complain that your salad is over-done.   Draw pornographic images in the butter and then complain about the presentation.   With each mouthful, gargle your wine. Bonus points if you then spit into someone else's glass.   Eat item of each course in alphabetical order.   Dress as a maitre-de and turn away ugly people at the door.   Dress as a chef and run into the restaurant screaming that the rats are back.   Dress as a rat and run into the restaurant screaming that the food is horrible.   Juggle.   Each time the waiter comes to your table, remove an item of clothing. When (if?) he asks what you're doing, inform him politely that you're playing strip three-course-meal. Then remove your pants.   Order everything 'well done'.   Order everything 'a l'orange'.   Order everything 'on the rocks'.   If an older waiter/waitress brings you your food, stand up and scream at him/her, 'You're not my real father/mother. Stop telling me what to do.'   When your main course arrives, say 'ew'. Then ask someone at an adjacent table whether they'd like to do swapsies.   Auction off your dessert.   Talk lovingly to your food as you eat it. Over the course of your evening gradually switch the tone from romantic to filthy/horny. See how many times you can slip the words 'throbbing' and 'nipples' into the commentary during the dessert course.   When paying for your meal, say goodbye to each note. Loudly, and emotionally, wish them luck on their journey.   Fake choking on your food. Repeat until evicted.   Deny the existence of starters. When the waiter asks what you would like to start, proclaim 'There's no such thing.' If he insists that there is, ask to see proof. Deny the proof when it arrives, telling him 'That's just a small main course.'   Ask your waiter to cut your food for you.   Announce the arrival of each course with a rousing song. Bonus points for participation from your fellow diners.   Ask if you can go back to the kitchen to thank the chef, and when you get in there head straight for the kitchen porter and thank  only  him.   Carry your main course around the restaurant, comparing what you got with the other diners' meals. Be vocal if someone's food looks better than yours.   Order a spanking, followed by a back-rub.   When the bill arrives, haggle.   Tip in pennies.   Instead of a tip, leave a note with the bill saying 'We prayed for your  eternal soul'.   Tip in foreign currency.   Tip with your phone number, and a note saying 'call me ;)'.   Tip with your partner's phone number and a note saying 'save me from this loveless marriage'.    Make race-car noises whilst you eat.   Remain standing throughout the meal. If the waiter asks you to sit down, tell him that it's against your religion.   Tuck the tablecloth in at your shirt collar. Bonus points for tucking it in to your shirt cuffs as well.   Shortly after arriving, run through the restaurant with your hands on your crotch shouting, 'Where are the toilets? I gotta go! I gotta go!' Repeat on the half-hour thereafter, shouting 'Let me through, I can't hold it much longer!'   Flirt. With anybody and everybody.   Cover your head with your napkin when you sit at your table. When the waiter comes over refuse to take the napkin off, only asking 'are they still watching me'. When he asks you who, say only 'Them.'   Perform the heimlich manouevere on people. When they ask you what you're doing, simply say, 'Better to be safe than sorry.'   Stand up and tap the side of your wine glass with your fork, as if you were preparing to make a toast. When you have everyone's attention read the menu (beginning to end) as if you were delivering some great Shakespearean dialogue. 'Soup! . . . of the day.'   Stand up and tap the side of your wine glass with your fork, as if you were preparing to make a toast. When you have everyone's attention sit down again.   Take your cruets around the restaurant, offering people salt and pepper. If they point out that they already have salt and pepper, cry.   On finishing each course, do a lap of victory around the restaurant. Stop to shake a few people's hands and thank them for coming. Bonus points for doing the lap of victory with your shirt pulled up over your head.   Just as your first bit of food is served, insist that everyone at your table says grace. Make it as long winded as possible. Thank God for everyone involved in the preparation of your meal, no matter how indirectly. '. . . and thank you lord, for the detergent manufacturers, without whom we would not have clean dishes to eat our food from.'   Speak only in rhyming couplets, from placing your order to conversing with your fellow diners. Bonus points if you're in a group and two of you do it, with the second providing the rhyme to whatever the first one says.

         You mean he's actually . . . ?   Oh yeah, got some writing done this morning.  Added another 85o words to the second rat piece, but unfortunately I'm still 135o words off May's target.

         It has begun   Woohoo!  The  World Cup  has started.  30 days and 64 matches (I think) mean that I'm not going to get any work done in the near future.  All that writing I was going to get done--not going to be anywhere near as productive as I had hoped.  All those jobs I was going to apply to--I'll be lucky if I write the first line of my CV.  Watched the opening cermony and first game today.  The opening ceremony was impressive.  A riot of colour, a feast of dubious metaphors and brilliantly coreographed Korean dancers, it was quite a sight.  Visually captivating, the opening ceremony was full of the usual craziness and costumes and for the most part I enjoyed it, but I have to ask . . . what the hell were those digital teletubbies about?

         Not Nearly as Productive . . .   . . . as I want to be.  I only managed to get 7oo words done on the Rat Challenge Pieces yesterday (yes, I've started the second one), and nothing on the day before that.  Grr.  Need to write ten pages in the next two days to reach this month's target, and--looks around the room--the   Buffy . . .  series finale  is on tonight, so it's all going to have to be done tomorrow.  Can't see it happening, somehow.  Later . . .

         A Rat Like Me   Wrote another 5oo words on the first of my two 'rat challenge' stories yesterday.  But I'm beginning to doubt if either of them will be finished by Saturday.  Posting late won't be a problem, as long as it doesn't prevent me getting the reviews done of the other rat stories.  All of this is academic if my credit card bill doesn't come through in the near future; I'm  still  waiting to get my  PayPal  membership number so that I can rejoin the  workshop .  Grrr, should have just tried to barter with the workshop people--would have been a lot less hassle.  Bought a new disk drive this morning (and that's only just over a year since the last one got a disk stuck in it :( I am far too lazy).  Desperately need to start backing up files and stuff tonight.

         Finally Free   Well, the exams finished two days ago, and I should finally be able to start getting some words down.  Not really done much in the two days since I finished: Friday night and Saturday morning were spent celebrating and recovering (think I celebrated too hard, my wallet felt a  lot  lighter when I woke up on Saturday).  Anyway, that's besides the point.  Started putting some words down on computer for June's Challenge piece (on paper . . . there is no way I could have faced a monitor yesterday), but had to stop because of visitors.  I've actually got two ideas for the challenge.  I'm hoping that I can get them both finished before the first of June, because then I can workshop the better of the two, and leave the other for another month.  Later . . .

         Five Days to go Until I Finish My Exams . . .   . . . and I'm wasting my time writing in this thing :)  It's not as bad it sounds; I'm working hard, but those  Safety Engineering  course notes are such a struggle to read.  It's not the big words that are stumping but the fact that it's boring and written almost entirely in bullet points.  This entry's just to say that I won't be posting again until next saturday (at the earliest).  I'm unlikely to be doing any writing in that time, so no one's going to miss out on anything.  Four exams in four days.  Only worried about one of them, but that would be last exam.  With any luck it won't put a dampener on the celebrations we have planned for Friday night.  Wish me luck . . .

         First of the Little Amusements   Oh yeah, apparently this is the result of my d&d character test:   I Am A:  Chaotic Evil Human Fighter Paladin    Alignment:   Chaotic Evil  characters are the most 'evil' people out there. They are willing to do anything to get ahead, and will kill anyone who stands in their way. A chaotic evil person sees no value in order and governments, and believes to the utmost in the tenant that 'Might Makes Right'.    Race:   Humans  are the 'average' race. They have the shortest life spans, and because of this, they tend to avoid the racial prejudices that other races are known for. They are also very curious and tend to live 'for the moment'.    Primary Class:   Fighters  are the warriors. They use weapons to accomplish their goals. This isn't to say that they aren't intelligent, but that they do, in fact, believe that violence is frequently the answer.    Secondary Class:   Paladins  are the Holy Warriors. They have been chosen by a God/dess to be their representative on Earth, and must follow the code of that deity, or risk severe penalties. They tend towards being righteous, but not generally to excess.    Deity:   Talos  is the Chaotic Evil god of storms, forest fires, earthquakes, tornadoes, and destruction in general. He is also known as the Destroyer. His followers fear him more than worship him, and they revel in the destructive fury of nature - while praying to be spared from its wrath. Talos's symbol is three lightning bolts, of different colors, coming from a central point.

         Will not be Silenced   Have had unbelievable trouble logging into  blogger.com  over the last four days . . . hence the complete lack of an update.  This one's going to have to be a short one, as I've left all my work out in the library and I don't trust any of the shifty-looking students that occupy the nearby tables.  Sunday night I wrote 700 words of my WiP and then on Monday night I added another 600 and finished chapter two (again).  It's a lot of talk about the journal, which probably means I'm going to have to cut most of it when I rewrite it.  I can see the reviews now:  nice enough story . . . but it's  too  long.   That seemed to be the general gist the last time I workshopped it.  Last night I wrote about five hundred words on the 'Sergeant Dolittle' thing I've got in reserve, started writing a little bit about the (still nameless) main protaganist's character.  Going to try and do that for all the main characters, but it may take a very long time at the rate I'm going.  Later . . .

         Almost Court   Wow.  Sometimes I surprise even myself.  Recently I resolved to do at least 1 hour of writing everyday.  I'm keeping up with it, although the actual amount of words I do get down has been variable, as any additions I make to my Journal would count towards that hour.  When I speak of the journal (currently called  A New Breed of Idiot ) I refer to the real thoughts-and-feelings journal that I maintain on my home pc--I decided on keeping that stuff seperate because a). I doubt many people would actually want to read it and b). there are certain things that I just don't want certain people to see (loves and hates typically).  Anyway, back to the matter in hand. I sat down on Friday night and managed to add 650 words to  Dearest . . .  in one hour.  And that's after a full day of revision.  This is unprecedented.  Go me.   Eleven Squared   Partook in the BBC's  Test the Nation  thing last night.  Apparently, although I neither trust the test's accuracy nor believe that IQ tests have any use whatsoever beyond looking good in front of your mates, I have an IQ of 121 (the average being about 100).  Kind of disappointing because the previous  test  I took said that it was 158.  I am hoping that instead of my intelligence having plumetted over the last few months that these tests are in fact based on different scales.  Later . . .

         Kiara's Back   Am happy; I worked on my WiP for the first time in almost three months.   Dearest . . .  now has 350 extra words, which is always welcome.  I feel a little cruel.  Kiara stormed out of the bar three months ago and she's only just been allowed to go back inside.  It was a very cold night, hope she's not angry :)  The word count sounds more impressive when you realise that during the first incantation of this book I spent three months working on the aftermath of one sexual encounter.

         It's True, It's True   Finally remembered to check my word tally before I came in this morning.  Counting the 400 words plotting that I did towards that 'Sergeant Dolittle' thing I'm planning, i've done 1250 this month already.  Doesn't sound all that impressive, but I think it is considering what a busy month this is destined to be.  May do a bit more tonight, but I want to start working on my CV.  Later . . .

Have just handed in my final piece of coursework as an undergraduate.  Bit disappointing, really.  I was expecting it to be a bit more momentus, but instead it was just hard and unfulfilling.  Which is also how you could describe my last lecture.  Party was boring.  Very boring.  Have to go home now and see if they've succeeded in making the house any tidier.  Later . . .

         So Far as is Reasonably Practicable    The nub of what I was trying to say earlier in my eaten post:  No writing done today (I'm supposed to be working, damn it!).  Have set targets for May.  Essentially my aim is to get 75oo  new  words down this month (it's less because of my finals at the end of this month).  Will record how many words I've done so far tomorrow when I get a chance to check my computer at home.  I know the title sucks (what comes from misreading my  Civil Engineering Dynamics  notes).  I will change it when I think of something better.  I'm not happy.  It's bank holiday and I'm (apparently) working.  I've actually come onto Campus, have to work until 12, and then we're having a barbecue for my housemate's bday.  It's drizzly outside :(  Later . . .

         Pasta with a chicken oxo cube   400 words added to  Dearest . . .  tonight.  Getting nearer towards the target, but I still don't think I'm going to make it.  Not a great deal of time tonight.  But, to bulk this entry up:    'Last night . . .' he started.   Looks like he doesn't want to say it was a mistake,  Ki thought bitterly.   Would he feel better if I told him it didn't happen?   He looked at the door--through the door--and his face creased.  Across the hallway his girlfriend was probably still asleep, but if she  did  see him doing the walk of shame in his dinner  jacket . . .  'I love Erica.'    Later . . .

         The Morning After   Was really pleased with myself before I logged on this evening.  I had written another 8oo words to  Dearest . . .  and that was 'evening only' stuff, so I felt quite productive today.  I can't help but feel that I'm cheating tho'--it's essentially old stuff that I'm rewriting (chapter 4 is the old chapter 2).  Those 8oo words aren't  really  new, they're just slightly better.  Came to a block at about half nine and had to stop on the WiP for a while.  I considered writing another tale for the  The Serendip , but didn't have any ideas.  All I managed to write down was  Kevn's Fourth - a Tale of the Serendip by Kevin Jones .  Already I like it better than my previous three tales ;)  Later . . .

         Writing   Ho hum.  Writing . . .  . . . Not nearly got as much done as I would have liked.  My word tally this month is up to--checks spreadsheet--545o words, most of which has been on  The Carrier .  I'm a long way off the target for June (1oooo words).  This will be the second month in a row that I've not reached the post.  *sigh*.  Now that I'm back online I  should  be able to provide more frequent updates to this thing, but we'll see.  It would help if I actually got more than 5o words down a day, then I'd at least have something to write about.  Later . . .

         Infinte White   I've been away awhile . . .  Got internet access at home a few nights ago, and have just forced the website back into service.   Check it .  I've given it a new look and there's actually some content there as well (for a change, altho' it's not a great deal).  The  library  section will be where most of the new content will be found, but I've also added sections (well, pages actually) for  news ,  contact ,  links  and  credits .  There is also a link to my poorly neglected 'blog, and the best parts from the old  thoughts of the misguided  site.  Anyway, check it out (that link again is  infinitewhite.net ).  All of the above pages can be reached from there.  Let me know what you think.  As I always say: If you like what you see, tell your friends.

I got a  2:1  (upper second class honours)!   66.8% average  for the year (although I can't work out my total average until my computer comes back to me).  I'm  very  happy :)  This is the culmination of four years of work, and the enormity of that is only just beginning to sink in.  When I finished my last lecture/piece of coursework/exam it never seemed all that big, but now I realise just how big it is.   I have finished!   I have achieved what I set out to do - four years of stress during exams and near to coursework deadlines, four years of hardwork (and some damn good times as well :) ) are now over.  I am a graduand.  I have a degree (or at least I will after the grad ceremony).  I have letters (MEng).  I still don't have a job, but there's plenty of time to worry about that.  I'm so happy.

         Radical Rat   More writing related news!  The second rat challenge piece has been finished.  Wrote some more words down last night before I went out (no word count tho' because of my computer's holiday), and wrote the final paragraph this morning before coming in here.  It was a lot more than I had expected to write when I blogged yesterday, but at least it's done.  As I've said before, it's going to change a lot when I revise, but I'm not too worried about that.  I have some kind of idea as to where it's going to go.  I like to leave a week between finishing a draft like that and revising it, so it'll likely be the first thing I work on when I'm back in the Sticks.  And, the story has a name now as well:  The Carrier .  I'm keeping my eyes open for something that sounds better, but these things usually come later in the creation process for me, at a time when I have a better  feel  for the story I'm writing.  Later . . .

         Clarity and a Recognisable Shape   Spent last couple of days updating the websites.  I have copies of them in a form of limbo on my computer, but I do think they will be ready to be let loose on the web just as soon as I get back to Devon (providing my isp will host it for me . . . i'm running out of options).  The Library now has a story in it ( All the Doors you Open ), the News and Links sections have been updated accordingly and I've even started on an Images section (although at the moment it's just a few photos of me whilst I'm pissed).  Watch this space, I'll make an announcement as soon as they are back . . .

         Man, we just couldn't stop laughing   Well, my parents came up this morning and took all of my stuff away ready for the move back home next weekend.  It means that I'll be without a computer for the next seven days (unless I decide I want to walk into campus).  It shouldn't harm my writing too much, as I've doing all of that stuff by hand and then typing it up recently.  What this does mean however is that I won't have any kind of word count update until I get my computer back  and  get some form of internet access sorted out.  Last friday (which was the last time I got anything down due to underestimating my packing) I got another 8oo words down for the second rat piece.  It is almost finished.  I can feel the end of this story and I  know  that I may only have another paragraph or two to write.  The trouble is . . . I was thinking about the story whilst walking into town the other day and I now know that there is another--better--way of telling it.  I'll probably end up chopping most of it in the rewrite.  Never mind.  It looks like the first rat piece is going to be scrapped altogether.  It wasn't that good a story in the first place and now I feel that it never will be.  It also looks like neither will be workshopped (it's the 9th of June already!).  Going back home in a minute to write those last paragraphs.  Later . . .

         Dude, My Hands Are Huge    This jubilee stuff is really eating into my writing.  I can't believe it's four days into june already and I've written a sum total of 2oo words (added to the second Rat Challenge Piece).  I am now convinced that I'm not going to have either of them ready in time to join in this challenge (I know I have to the end of the month, but I need to be able to crit all the other submissions as well).  I sense that it's almost finished, maybe a couple of days work, but I'm not entirely sure I know how it's going to end.  Yesterday, I  did  manage to finally go through the reviews I had received on the last challenge I took part in.  That was March--the Second Person PoV Challenge.  Some of the suggestions have been implemented, but I'm not sure if I'm going to put the main one into effect.  Everyone who read it suggested that the ending was somewhat lacking, but because I don't have any further plans for it (I'm not going to be sending it out) i don't think it's worth trying to improve.  It will be posted to the website pretty much as is, and that'll do for that.  I've also got a title for it:  All the Doors you Open .  It will be posted as the first of the new  Tales of Skanpen Peak  and it should be a fairly decent, if brief, introduction.  Later . . .

         Kevin Jones is a part of the team as well   Well, I finished writing and typing the letter story.  I still hate it.  It's still not got a name.  Aaaaaarrrrggh.  Something I've discovered since I started writing the correspondence is how hard it is to write letters with different voices, so that they at least read as if they were written by two different people.  I can manage it with dialogue okay (or I think I can) but whenever I write letters they always come out looking as if they were written by me.  I find myself thinking,  that's exactly how I'd say it .  I suppose that's why it's called a challenge; it's a chance to improve our skills in a certain topic by practice and receiving feedback.  I just wish that it wasn't so hard.  Aside from that frustration, I haven't really done a lot.  I've tried thinking of some ideas for the mystery piece, but after a couple of hours I'm beginning to suspect that I don't even  have  a mystery muse (I wonder where I can find one before the winter, my others just found me).  I have the inkling of a few ideas, but they're going to need a lot of tinkering.   Very fast down this first hundred   Meanwhile, in the real world: my official graduation photograph has arrived.  If I ever get it scanned in, I'll put it up (or maybe not, too many people are going to see it as it is).  Still jobless.  Later . . .

         Kevin Jones is trying to keep that from happening to someone else.   Well I've finished typing up  Curiousity  (and right now I can't decide whether it has two u's or not) today.  I'm still feeling really happy about this piece, which is both cool and unprecedented; I don't have anything like that for the letter story.  Right now I'm only keeping on at it because I don't feel ready to start my next bit of work.  Neverwell.  Considering the letter story, I wrote another three letters today, so only two left.  No word count on that one until I type it, but I do finally have a total for  Curiosity .  4000 words.  Brings me nicely closer to this month's target.  Yay.  Tomorrow: more letter writing and maybe some mystery writing.  Later . . .

         Kevin Jones is serving as the Dean of Elections   Friday: wrote the first couple of letters for the letter story, although I think that I'm just going to sack it as there's no way I'll get it done for the end of the month.  This story just hasn't grabbed me enough to think that I can continue it with no deadline or without the 'challenge' potential that it's currently got.  Today: wasted the day.  May do more tomorrow.

         You didn't mention the paintballing   No update last night because I went into town with a few mates and coming back, after six pints of Kronie, I didn't particularly feel like making an update.  It doesn't matter, I wasted yesterday and didn't actually get any writing done.  One of the mates was the first person I've actually spoken to who's read this thing.  From what he said (after he finished telling me that i'm 'fucked up'), it isn't really clear that this is a  writing journal , the sole purpose of which is to chronicle my forays into the world of writing and occasionally link to things that annoy me.  If I wanted to include my thoughts and feelings then I would post my real journal, but honestly, I don't think people want to read that.  Drewsy (for that is his name) told me a couple more times that I was fucked up, told me off for using too many long words and then said that he enjoyed the bit about the chat-up lines (part of the now-defunct  humour website  that was written 5 or so years ago!).  Anyway, I guess I appreciate him visiting . . . as I've said, I always value feedback even if it is from someone who looked blank when I told him I write 'fiction'.  He's lucky that I didn't say I write Speculative Fiction (as I've taken to doing lately).  Something else he told me off was not mentioning his birthday celebrations last month.  Again, I'd like to mention the 'writing journal' thing, but for Drewsy's sake, here it is:  On the 29th of June a group of us (mainly composed of rugby players, but including a couple of hangers-on like myself) went Paintballing to celebrate the 22nd year of Drewsy's life.  It was a pretty cool day actually, first time I've ever been and a lot more fun than I was anticipating.  We were initially disappointed that we didn't get to shoot each other (everyone had someone they wanted to shoot at close range, because apparently it hurts, and we're all bastards), but being all on the same team was enjoyable enough.  Our team, the Commando Crabs (what else?),  annihilated  the opposition in four games.  200 points to ten (and they had more people than us).  I shot two people, got shot twice.  To celebrate we all went back to town, played some football and then spent the rest of the day getting pissed.  We went to  Fusion Squared , because that's where we  always  go.  We got Drewsy suitably drunk.  He threw up in the car on the way in (managing to get most of it into a pint glass that he had brought with him from the pub), and only actually lasted in the club for about twenty minutes before he was spotted outside, sitting on a wall and feeling sorry for himself.  All in all, a good night, I'm just disappointed no one had a camera.  There you go, Drewsy, I mentioned the paintballing . . .

         Kevin is a founding member of the amazing comedy troupe . . .   Well, I finished the first draft of  Curiosity , and have begun to type it up.  Progress has been slowed somewhat by a nasty bout of hayfever combined with what looks like the beginnings of a cold, but I still managed to get a bit typed up.  Looking at what I've typed I am little worried at how long the story will turn out.  Writing too much has always been one of my problems, and this morning I managed to turn half a hand written page into three manuscript pages.  Guess I shouldn't complain, but . . . aaaaarrrrggh!  I just know when I come to write the letter story I'll be able to get about two hundred words down before the well dries up.  If I've used up all of my words (for this month at least) on one story I shall be upset.  On the subject of the 'letter story' I have a beginning, half a middle and no end (I'm thinking that I'm going to want to write three letters, three seems like a good number for some reason).  I still have no idea what I'm going to write for the 'mystery story'.  The idea of writing something a bit like film noir appeals to me, but as I've never seen any film noir (I've only ever seen spoofs, and who knows how realiable they are) it would probably be a bad idea.  Odds are I'll probably end up writing something a bit like  Diagnosis Murder .  Makes me wonder if there is any room for a crime-fighting doctor in the Serendip*ity . . .  Tuning into  Hallmark  for a spot of research . . .

         Curiosity killed the cat   Not much done over the last couple of days except for a bit more writing (by hand) towards  Curiosity  (the old lady story).  Again, no word count, but I'll set that straight when I get around to typing it.  I want to write something for August's challenge--which looks like it will be the letter one--so I've been trying to think of some ideas for that.  I've got one, but I don't quite know where I'm going to go with it yet.  I've also been trying to think of ideas for the next  Serendip contest  as well.  Later . . .

         Do you honestly think there's time to be lazing around?   Spent a great portion of today making a start on a story that I've had the idea for for a couple of months now.  It's the one about the old lady and the house full of toys . . .  It was a nice day so I was writing by hand (which is unusual enough) in the back garden.  Think I sunburnt for my troubles tho'.  I'll update the word count thing if I ever get the story typed up (or finished).  Later . . .

         You can tell   Well, it's been another long stretch without an update.  How's you keeping?  Sometimes, I wonder exactly why I keep coming back, but then someone says, you do have something to say.  I'm beginning to liken my participation in this thing to my TV however.  The aerial reception in my little corner of the Sticks is terrible, and consequently the picture comes and goes.  I've noticed that whenever I'm trying to watch something, the only time i get a signal is when the adverts are on.  So, basically, you're missing all the good stuff, and I can never remember it when I return here.  I'll see what I can do.  Last week, I graduated.  I wore a silly robe with a silly hood.  I put a silly hat on my head and partook in perhaps the silliest ceremony I've ever seen, but what a day!  It was great, and I really enjoyed it.  My family really enjoyed it, and my friends really enjoyed it.  During the day I thought that I looked pretty sharp, when my dad's photographs came back I realised that I didn't.  As soon as I get a scanner I'll put them on my webspace and let everybody see them.  Not much of a threat, I know.  I've sent off applications to four firms.  Didn't realise how long it took to fill those things out, but it's not like I've got anything else to be doing.  Spent far too much time playing Baldur's Gate II.  Oh, yes, and I've actually got a bit of writing done.  I've managed to bring this month's total up, but I'm still falling short of my goal.  I'm still trying to redraft  The Carrier , but it's looking good so far.

         Whatdunnit   Reading through some of the other Zoo members' blogs today when I saw that they've got an initial page up for the next  serendip writing competition .  Sounds like it could be a bit of fun, but am wondering if I need to get a Mystery Muse now, or whether one of my other muses could handle the task.  Not that I have that many (obviously not, I don't have all that many ideas).  Got another three-fifty words down tonight on  The Carrier .  Still haven't got a job.  Finally finished reading  The Talisman  by King and Straub.  Found it better than  Black House , a lot better.  Because I just haven't read enough Stephen King lately I've jumped straight into  Dreamcatcher .  Later . . .

         There will be no hiding place on the internet   Well, I've finished Chapter 4 of  Dearest . . . .  It's the rewritten scene of Kiara and Jonathon waking up together, but I'm more pleased with it this time.  I added one thousand, one hundred words on Friday afternoon (the 28th), but I didn't get any more written because it was a busy old weekend.  So alas I didn't reach June's target, but 775o was a lot closer than I got in May.  Chapter 4 was finished yesterday when I added another 25o words.  Since I finished it I've started rewriting  The Carrier  (I'm determined not to let it go, even though I missed the challenge by a long shot).  Also did a review yesterday, but it was for a friend from the Sticks rather than from the Zoo.  I'm going to email the review to him tonight, see what he thinks.  Later . . .

          Pound Store    Yesterday: finally started working on  Pound Store , an idea I've had in one form or another for about five years.  Back then it was part of a novel (a comic-fantasy that never got off the ground), but I think that I've now got a way of making it a short story.  It's still got the comic elements, but from the first few paragraphs written yesterday it looks like it may end up a little darker than that.  I wrote about 250 words (by hand), but I'll say correct the word count when I get around to typing it up.  Today: wrote another review for Mr. Barker's updated story, and one for a story on the  Horror 'shop .  Posted both of them.  Worked a little on  Thanks for Listening , getting myself ready to start the final confrontation.    Who the bloody hell do you think you are?   Student With No Razor's sent me another piece to look at.  If you're reading this, SWNR, I'll get to it as soon as I can.  I'll reply to your email as well.  I've had a brief read of it, but other pieces are in the queue before you.  Later . . .

         People can fake all sorts of stuff, can't they?   Another slow day, but today it's down to some developments in the career hunt, rather than me actually being lazy.  After going in to sign on I got a phonecall inviting me to an assessment day at one of the first companies I applied to.  Great, I thought, I only sent the form of six weeks ago.  What I've been yearning for from these people is feedback; I want to get off to interviews.  However, it turns out the assessment day is tomorrow morning, so I can't go.  If I'd wanted to go, I'd have to get up at 4 in the morning.  Damn.  I can't help but think that someone at that company forgot to invite me.  So after all of that and preparing another couple of applications to send out tomorrow, I didn't have a lot of time to actually get any writing done.  I wrote a review (only to discover that the piece I reviewed has already been revised, damn it, so now I'm going to have to take another look at it).  And that was it.  Later . . .

         Ain't got nothing to say   It's true, I'm afraid. I have been . . . not exactly lazy . . . more like over occupied this past few days.  Okay, I've been lazy, but only a little.  Most of the weekend has been spent either enjoying myself or recovering from enjoying myself.  Clubbing on Thursday, Cinema on Friday (watched  Reign of Fire , which wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting, although I had major issues with the female lead's ability to keep her appearance so well groomed), family barbecue on Saturday, Jen's barbecue yesterday (which was fun, although I think I drank too much), and a visit to the Cove of the Hopeless for Bank Holiday Monday (went as part of the village's annual weekend of festivities, which included such delights as grown men racing milk churns, a man singing  American Pie  in the club style and seeing one of Elydian's close friend's dressed as a horse).  Needless to say, far too much drink, too many burgers, sausages and burnt pieces of chicken, and too much exposure to the sun (seeing that I typically have the tolerance to the sun of a vampire) has meant that I have got very little writing done.  I did manage to post a review (or was it two?), and I've given some more thought to some short stories--namely the Serendip Competition Piece.  And that's about it.  With any luck I'll have a bit more progress to report tomorrow.  Either that or some more excuses.  Later . . .

         Evil Email   I hate chain mail.  After much ranting and shouting, I thought that I'd finally made all of my friends realise the depths this.  'It's worse than junk mail,' I told them, 'because it's your friends filling your inbox with crap.  Friends that should know better.'  Most of my friends got the point, all but two of them.  The first continues to forward the crap because he finds my reaction to them hilarious . . .  (when he sent me the one about Bill Gates giving you some money for everytime you forward the email on, I replied with a long rant detailing why every sentence in the mail was basically bullshit.  It was a university lunchtime when I didn't have very much to do, and I'm since regretting doing it as it sparked off a load of 'let's see how he reacts to this' emails)  . . . the second now only forwards the guilt trip ones.  You know the type.  They're the ones that go along the lines of 'here are fifty reasons friends are great, next to some pictures of bears holding balloons that will take about an hour to download on your machine, and if you don't send them to  everybody  in your address book then you are an evil bastard who will never be loved'.  And I fall for it everytime.  I open the emails because I naively think, ah, this might be worth reading, surely my friends know me well enough not to send me crap.  I should know better.  One of the emails was entitled 'Nice things' for fuck sake, as if that wasn't a big enough clue.  Okay, rant over.  On with the writing journal.    Don't throw in the towel 'cos there's a place right down the block Where you can drink your misery away   Wednesday: started a review, sunbathed (hey, it's summer, and I'm getting fed up sitting at my computer).  Thursday: finished one review, started another.  Once I get this one done I'll have hit my month's tally.  Friday: nothing.  Later.

         Boy racer Boy racer, oh   More hardworking than ever today.  Started chapter six of  Dearest . . .  and managed to add another 7oo words to the tally.  And, they're all new, as opposed to the usual regurgitated or rewritten stuff.  I also wrote another one of the reviews that I needed to return.  Not only that, but I've also managed to get some real work done . . .  Unperturbed by my recent 'thanks, but no thanks', I sent off four CVs to some more consultancies.  With any luck they'll be a bit more successful.  I'm going to send off some more over the next few days, as someone has advised me in the benefits of bombarding potential employers.

         Jonathon and Erica   Brace yourselves . . .  Yesterday I did some work towards  Dearest . . . .  Not only that, but I managed to write almost ten pages on  Chapter 5 .  That's an extra 2300 words towards this month's word tally.  As can be imagined, I'm quite pleased with myself.  Today, I managed to complete the chapter with another 1o5o words.  I'm ready to start thinking about how Kiara's going to start playing with the journal, although I may take a break to work on something else for a bit.  I don't know.  I've also thought about changing the name of  Unknown , my tragic love story in progress.  Have toyed with the idea of using  Thanks for Listening , as it sounds better than the existing name.  I think that it also gives a little something else to the sex scene.  The reason I've been thinking about this is that I've been typing up what I handwrote at the end of July/beginning of August.  Still don't feel ready to write the final bit.  Later . . .    You may be my evil half-brother, but there's no law against murdering the other half   Heard back from my interview yesterday, which is fairly impressive after only three working days.  I didn't convince them well enough, it appears, but it's not a complete failure yet: they've passed my details onto another skills group within the company to see if there's an opportunity there.  It's more structural work than the beach movement stuff that the first group were offering, which was where my interest really lies (I was under a misguided impression of what their Coastal Group did until I got to the interview).  This is my first job rejection.  Whoop-dee-doo.

         And they've rigged up the pinball so it's free all night   Today: finished another review.  Finally finished my changes to the  The Carrier , although I couldn't bring myself to read it again.  Later . . .    Thoughts on Mrs. Painter   There's something decidely creepy about old ladies.  If you'd asked me yesterday, I honestly couldn't have told you where Mrs. Painter, the peculiar old lady from  Curiosity , actually came from.  I couldn't figure out what inspired her until I took a bus into Kings this morning.  The next village over from Limbo, let's call it the Dynamic Village, is where people go to die once they get here.  They wait their time out in a collection of bungalows and the like at the end of the village.  Twice a day or so the bus goes down there to pick them all up.  They gather behind the bus stop--sometimes up to a dozen of them--as if they were huddling together for warmth.  When it comes they rush forward, chittering.  They all look the same--exactly as I described Mrs. Painter, except that I left out the coats they all wear, all-weather polyester creations in varying shades of blue and grey and biege.  The chittering continues on the bus, like the insistent squawk of excited birds.  I began to think that maybe I was over-reacting--I mean, what kind of person thinks such things about sweet old ladies?  And then a wasp somehow got on the bus, and I watched as one of the old ladies ruthlessly killed it.  Without wasting any time she pulled one of those thick bus timetables from her bag, and administered to it the kind of beating that is normally reserved for tendering steak.  I moved back a few seats.  The old lady returned the timetable to the bag and resumed her chittering.  I think I'm onto something.

         You're a naughty child and that's concentrated evil coming out the back of you   Curiosity had some good reviews when I checked yesterday.  Liked, but we had the usual comments: too much use of the passive voice; general need for tightening up.  Sunday: nothing much, although I've downloaded the stories I need to return the reviews I received.  Today: wrote one review and started another.  Rebuilt the images website so that when I've got some images I can put it straight up.  Later . . .

         Nailsea and Blackwell   I don't know whether it's down to nerves or not, but my dreams on Thursday night were incredibly vivid.  Also--for a wonder--I can remember them.  Another unusual thing: in the 24 hours preceding my interview I had no less than three new story ideas.  My muses seem to be back.  On the surface this would appear to be a good thing, but I'm not entirely convinced.  On my way to the interview I could think of nothing else.  When I should have been trying to anticipate interview questions these stories had my brain in some kind of three-way tug of war.  One of the dreams came from one of the story ideas, I think.  The idea came from a conversation with Elydian, about (for a change) women.  It was essentially about siamese twins and the dream had elements of that in it.  The other dream became one of the story ideas.  In one of those weird half awake, half dreaming moments I was convinced that someone, I don't know who, was in trouble.  I thought I heard someone screaming my name and came instantly awake.  I spent the next five minutes sat up in bed trying to hear it again.  I think that I can do something with that.  The third idea is the one I'm less confident with.  I heard something at breakfast that got me thinking about IVF babies and miscarriages.  It's a novel-length idea if I can just work out all the details, but I've got a sneaking suspicion that it's been done before.  I need to think about it some more.  Seriously, the last couple of days have been very weird.  I've never been so inspired or had so little time to play with my ideas.   Weston-super-Mare   Thursday: wrote my first review in about five months (if you don't count the one I did for Student With No Razor).  Friday: interview.  Saturday: nothing.  Today: going to continue critting the other piece I downloaded, post the first review, and see if  Curiosity  has picked up any reviews of its own.   Teignmouth   I think that the interview went alright, but we shall see in a couple of weeks whether I convinced them or not.   Newton Abbot   Hours of fun:   They Fight Crime!   You know, it's the this sort of thing that really makes the internet worthwhile for me.  Simple, but funny.  I will write a story based on one of the results I got.   Totnes   Coming soon: what we did on fireworks night  Later . . .

         Ow-Ow-Ow-I'm a Genius-Ow-Ow   Sometimes I feel like I'm really stupid.  Sometimes I feel like I don't know anywhere near  as much  as the people around me.  Two examples:  First.  I posted a question to the  Zoo  as I was having trouble distinguishing between 'passed' and 'past' and the circumstances in which is was right to use each.  When the proper meanings were explained to me, it became clear and I should be able to avoid the confusion again.  I just can't help feeling that I should have known that already, that I should have been able to work it out for myself without having to appeal to the Listmind for help.  I don't mind asking, and I appreciate the help that was given, but I still feel stupid.  It's like sometimes I wonder what right I have to call myself a writer, to attempt to be one, when my education in the English Language only goes as far as GCSE.  There are a load of people in the group who have degrees in English, or who are English teachers, and here's me who's never even been taught what a preposition is.  I remember English lessons yet I can't remember ever doing anything so simple as circling the verbs in a sentence.  Second.  I have a degree in civil engineering, yet I feel like I know nothing about the subject whatsoever.  It sometimes seems that I can remember nothing from my four years of study, even though they only ended two months ago.  When speaking to people about my subject I am unable to communicate what little I do remember and I have always had the impression that my mates from the course know a  lot  more than I do.  With this job interview coming up, it's a worry.  Well, I feel stupid.  I could probably give more/better examples, but then there'd be the danger of straying into whinging territory.  Like I've not been there already . . .   Jeep Full of Mutants   Today: made some changes to the Letter Story (though it still sucks); posted  Curiosity  to the  Zoo , and downloaded a couple of stories to review.  Later . . .

         Slow News Week   Perhaps I've not made it clear enough in the past, so I'll say it again.  Dear Friends and Readers, THIS IS A WRITING JOURNAL!  Okay, so maybe the clues weren't as apparent as I'd first imagined; the repeated inclusion of the words 'this is a writing journal', the repeated references to the art of writing, word counts, the titles of stories that I am currently working on . . .  I think that I'm going to give in, to an extent.  It seems that the only people who read this anyway are friends hoping for a name drop, so I might as well cater to them.  To that end I'm going to include the occasional 'Dear Diary, today I did this' style entry to keep Coops and Drewsy and the others happy.  If any of you people don't want your names to appear in these pages, let me know and I can make up an elaborate and offensive nickname for you.  On Saturday night I went into Kings as is standard practice in these parts.  It was quiet out; most of the locals had been out for the last two weekends and they don't like going out too often.  Coops and Jenny were out however and it was here that Coops told me off.  'I read your entry about Drewsy's birthday,' he said, 'but you didn't mention me.'  When I said that I could hardly mention everybody that was out that day (there were fifteen of us in total, and I don't particularly like listing names) I don't think he was convinced.  It went along the lines of being more important than the others, but I got the impression that he wanted a name drop.  Since then, I've tried to think of something notable that Coops said or did on Drewsy's birthday, but have come up short.  If you can think of anything, Simon, then let me know and I'll give you your name drop.  Saturday night itself was fairly standard.  We sat around and talked a load of bullshit.  Didn't get particularly pissed and didn't go to Fusion Squared.  Sunday, it was the Rugby Club's beer festival.  Eight real ales (no Badger's Bollock but there was some Badger Best), a tombola and some heavy rain in the evening.  Coops demonstrated a skill in handing out quiz sheets that had been downloaded off the internet, and passing them off as his own.  Later in the evening him and Drewsy went to do a shift behind the bar, where I'm sure they were just as skilled, but unfortunately I went home (you were right about that one).  In all it was a good ol' day, although some of the real ales left a lot to be desired.  Again, if something happened that you want mentioning drop me a line and I'll add it.  Is that better, Coops?   I Brought My Pogo Stick Just to Show Her a Trick   Well, it's been a moderately busy weekend, what with all that I've mentioned above (as well as going to the cinema with  four  of the Mechanios, which I didn't mention--yes Asteroth lives!), so I've got very little writing done.  I dusted off what I had written for  Unknown , my little tragic love story, and I've added another two scenes.  Now I've just got the last scene to write, and it's the hardest one, as it's the one where all of the truth comes out.  The last conversation between the two main characters is going to be a tough one to write, and I'm reluctant to do it.  I know what's going to happen, I just don't know how.  I'm also doubting my ability to do the emotion of the piece justice.  I will wait a while before I take another run at it.  I have finally rejoined the  Zoo , and am just waiting for my money to be processed before I can start submitting again.  Today, I have made a few changes to  Curiosity , ready for submitting to the workshop in a couple of days.  Later . . .

         If I Said you had a Beautiful Body Would you Take your Pants off and Dance Around a Little?     Added another 7oo words to  Chapter 7  of  Dearest . . . , but this one seems to be just running and running.  I keep pouring words into it, and I still don't seem to be any closer towards the end.  Kiara's entered the building where her dream was set now, and she's just about to recognise it.  I keep describing the surroundings though, putting off having to write the good stuff.  It's frustrating.  Wrote a review for a prologue on the Zoo.  Did some more plotting.  Later . . .

         Look at that Worm Go.  Who Says There are no More Heroes?     Well, Friday's interview went better than the last two, so much so I didn't even bother going up to the one scheduled for today.  I got there, had a surprisingly short talk with a couple of the engineers, and got offered the job.  I'm still waiting for some written confirmation to arrive, so I'm not getting too excited, but . . . I am happy :)  I know some people spend ages interviewing and getting a job, and I know that some people send out a lot more applications and get a lot more rejections than I have, but it still feels like this job hunt has taken  far too long .  It's only been three months, but they were a long three months.  That and the fact that most of my course-mates are either working already, or have jobs to come back to, have made me particularly impatient.  As long as I think about the bloke in London who said he sent out thirty applications, rather than Guy who got a job on his first attempt, or Al who  everybody  wanted to employ (or any of the others for that matter), I can call this a victory of form completion and CV writing.  Okay, maybe I'm deluding myself, being silly and getting too excited about this, but I don't care . . . I've got a job.    Your Catchphrase is Hysterical.  Please Say it Clearly for my Answer Machine Tape     Busy and expensive weekend.  Friday: interview; mate's girlfriend's sister's birthday party.  Saturday: standard jaunt into the very heart of the Sticks' social scene.  Sunday: babysitting cottage, dogs and kittens; Listening to Pantera at ridiculously high volume levels because there are no neighbours to upset.    Coming soon: Whining About Accomadation.   Now that the job hunt is winding down, you might actually notice less whining and actually some updates about writing.  Not a lot to say today though: added 400 words to  Dearest . . .   Later . . .

         You Call Yourself King of the Jungle?     It was review frenzy when I checked my two workshopped pieces last night.   Curiosity  had an extra one, and  The Well  had an extra two (after sitting on the horror'shop with one for almost three weeks).  I like getting reviews, it feels more like I'm not wasting my time at this.  What I like even more, however, is when they start with:  Professionalism of writing: 5   Setting: 5   Character development: 5   Plot credibility/suspense: 5   Dialogue: 5    Overall rating : 5   Of course, the guy was probably drunk, and it confirms my attitude towards the scoring system (being it doesn't work, it is completely misleading and it varies hugely on individual perspective) but it's still nice to see :)  I've definitely got something to work with.  Today: 550 extra words added to  Dearest . . .   Later . . .

         Have not Been Shortlisted for Interview     Picked up another review for 'Curiosity' last night.  Seemed to enjoy reading it, yet he said he was disappointed by the ending, that he wanted some of the mystery of the piece explored.  That's the first time anyone has mentioned this, so I think I'm going to see if it comes up again before I make any drastic changes.  Returned M's review.  His prologue was pretty cool, so I'm going to check out the first two chapters later on.  I'm trying to keep a philosophy of critting two stories for every unprompted review I recieve (in other words, I return the review and then crit someone new--kind of a pay it forward type thing), so I critted another piece.  Another 750 words typed towards  Chapter 7 .  Worked on some plotting.

          Changes      Today: another 45o words on my Work in Progress.  I've started  Chapter 7  (called  Changes ) with another Journal entry.  I should be able to start the chapter proper tomorrow.  Picked up one review for the new draft of  Curiosity .  It was from someone who had read the earlier draft, and he seemed to like the changes I've made.  Also, I had an idea for a flash piece whilst I was on the bus--although if I'm honest the idea has been hanging around unformed since I went to the city--so I tried to get some words down for that.  It doesn't have a title of yet, so lets just call it  The Flash Fiction Idea I Had on the Bus .    Action Man Line     Got another interview date through.  This one is from the company that already rejected me.  They said that they would pass my details onto another department, and it turns out that department may now have something for me.  I guess it's reassuring that the first department didn't tell the second not to even bother interviewing me.  I'm liking to think that the Second Department haven't heard Bad Things about me, but we'll see how it goes on Friday.  I also had another one come this Thursday, but I've had to rearrange this as it was difficult to get to and back in the same day (it being on the far side of London to me).  I could have travelled back the next morning, as I got somewhere to crash at Student With No Razor's, but would have meant travelling back on Friday, which means more expense.  They want me next Monday now instead.  Later . . .

         Most Important Formula you will Ever Require     Over the last couple of days I have made some changes to  Curiosity .  I think the biggest problem with that last draft was the over extensive use of the passive voice.  I've tried to get rid of all of it (I left a few instances in because they seemed to fit), but we'll have to see if people think the new slicker version is any better.

         You'll Only Get More Wrath     When recieving my train tickets to and from the interview yesterday I grossly underestimated my timings.  I ended up with two and a half hours to kill before the interview, so I had lunch by the river and then I went to St. Pauls to watch the 9-11 memorial service.  The interview went okay.  I think I managed to convince the first guy who interviewed me of my abilities.  However then we went upstairs and I found myself talking to one of the senior partners (the one that the company was actually named for).  He asked me a series of questions that I didn't have prepared answers for, and I'm fairly convinced that I came across as a bumbling idiot.  I guess I shall know soon enough if he thought the same thing or not.  After the interview I had another load of time to kill.  I was beginning to get my bearings--get an idea of what was within walking distance--so I decided to the tourist thing.  The engineer in me dragged the rest of me up the river to the  Amazing Oscillating Bridge , as it was the 'attraction' within walking distance that I most wanted to see.  Whilst I'm disappointed that I never got a chance to walk across the bridge whilst it still wobbled, it's quite an impressive sight nonetheless.  The views up and down the river are pretty cool as well.  Yesterday was my first visit to the capital in three years, the first in five years where I've done anything other than ride on trains.  Some things I've learned/remembered:  The city is filthy.  Seven hours and everything I own is grey/black.  There are more cafes and coffee chains than any respectable city needs.  There are no bins  anywhere .  It's as if they want you to litter.  The bridge has stopped  wobbling     Trust in me and I'll Lay all your Nightmares to Waste     Finished the first draft of  Thanks for Listening  this afternoon.  Added another 65o words to it.  I don't imagine for a second they're all very good words, but they're new, and that's the most important thing.  I have a feeling the story will change a lot in the rewrite.  Did an impromptu word count to see how far along  Dearest . . .  has gotten.  It came to 16ooo words, which is further than I've got before.  Not great, when you consider how much time has been inputted, but not bad either.  Later . . .

         The Pink Ones Keep you from Screaming     I wrote another review this afternoon, and have been feeling guilty ever since.  It was a bit of a savaging, and I really tried not to be too discouraging, yet I can't help but feel that the guy will never write another word again after reading it.  I know how demoralising it can be when you get a bad review, and when I write one I wouldn't be happy to receive I feel like I'm a complete bastard.  I do try to add constructive criticism, and I know that it's not as bad as some of the reviews people get (I've never used the word 'terrible', for example), but I still feel like I'm kicking someone in the head.  Later . . .    And Here I am Using my Legs Like a Sucker     And yes, I borrowed the cufflinks.  Am I ready for the interview?  I think so, but I shall be glad, regardless of the outcome, when it's over.  Wish me luck . . .

Stay tuned, it promises to be a riproaring journal entry.

         Came, Saw, Conquered   We took a trip to the  Largest Maze in the World  yesterday.  It's in Christchurch, Dorset, in a large field of maize.  It has 7.61 miles of paths set into this field (the paths were set out before planting with a GPS receiver) and it actually consists of three mazes of increasing difficulty: silver, gold and platinum.  It took us three hours to drive up there from the Sticks, but it was worth it.  We left early, so Jack and Big Ron spent most of the journey asleep.  We got there earlier than expected and, as the maze didn't take as long as we thought, we were back home again by six.  We were visiting the attraction fairly late in the season (it's only two weeks now until the crop gets harvested), so the maize had grown to above our heads.  At times (especially in the platinum maze, when we started to think we were going around in circles) you couldn't see anything other than crop; not any of the bridges or observation decks, not the marquee that awaited us in the centre, not the railway line that ran along the side of the field.  We didn't find the first two mazes much of a challenge: the silver maze was easy once you remembered where you'd been, and the gold maze we completed using the effective-but-boring method of only ever turning left (my associates didn't think it would work, but we completed it in 20 minutes).  The final maze, however . . .  We got put in mind of those horror films, where the hero is chased through a cropfield and ends up getting lost.  When Jack led us at a run through the platinum maze, taking random turns as he did so, not one of us managed to keep our bearings.  It's easy enough to do if you take it slowly--navigate by the sun, or just keep account of how many lefts and rights you've taken--but running makes it easier to get lost.  I never understood that before, how anyone can get lost in those situations, but I do now.  I like to think that I've got a pretty good sense of direction (unlike Elydian, who can get himself lost in people's houses) but even I got turned around.  You can't remember junctions because they all look the same.  You can't head in the right direction, because you can't tell what the right direction is.  Just when we were beginning to think that we had wandered into a big loop, which we were just repeating over and over, we found the exit, and felt an immediate sense of disappointment that, even lost, we had managed to complete it.  Still, that didn't last long, and we were soon standing on the victory bridge, laughing at those still inside and doing the victory dance.  Okay, it was only me doing the victory dance, and I stopped fairly quickly when the staff threatened to take my certificates away.    Staggered . . . but Lived to Tell the Tale   Watched   The Bourne Identity   last night.  Quite good, Matt Damon was surprisingly convincing in an action role.    Amaized and Dazed but not Fazed   Today: when I managed to stop our new kittens from attacking my feet, I worked a little on  Thanks for Listening .  Have added 300 words to the total.  Also read through another story ready to write a review.

I've also taken  Curiosity  down from the  zoo .  I'll make some changes and repost it just as soon as I finish this draft of  Thanks for Listening .  Later . . .    BritFlick Plot Generator   I've just updated  infinitewhite.net  and one of the new additions was the project I've been nattering on about this past few days.  The BritFlick Plot Generator generates a random plot for a BritFlick everytime the page is loaded.  It's of medium fun.  Wanna play?  Just go to  thoughts of the misguided  and click on the appropriate link.  Other than that, there's not a great deal new to the site.  A few more  links , and an  images website  with very few images.  Enjoy, and send comments, crits and abuse to the usual address  iapetus@mechanios.com .

I've got to finish writing it, so I'll probably try and update the website tomorrow night.  Speaking of which, I tried to visit  infinitewhite.net  last night, but something was wrong with  Regisuck 's url forwarding.

          The Well    Friday: Bit of thinking about storylines, but no new words.  Have resigned myself to missing last month's total.  Job applications.  Watched   Insomnia  .  I would heartily recommend that everybody watch this film--one of the best that I've seen this summer.  Yesterday: I resubmitted  The Well , but this time to the  Horror Workshop  as that seems a more fitting place for it.  It's a little worrying that this second draft has taken me almost a year to write (the first draft was EC runner up for September submissions at the Zoo  last  year).  It's just as well I'm not trying to make a living out of this--eleven months to do a rewrite?  I'd never eat.  Also yesterday: more job applications.  Today: tore Student With No Razor's story to pieces, and emailed him the remains.  Okay, maybe I exagerrate, but I like to.  Continued to work on  Thanks for Listening , adding another 45o words.  Later . . .

         We are not Here to Debate the Existence of Monsters     By the time anyone gets to see this I should be well into my second week of my new job.  The initial panic and the crisis of ability have, for the most part, disappeared and I am beginning to settle in.  I'm enjoying it so far, but then nobody's shouted at me, I've not had to do anything  too  taxing and I haven't inadvertently killed anybody yet.  I have joined the company in the middle of a desk shortage, and as yet they haven't actually found somewhere permanent for me to sit.  I'm playing musical chairs, only it's not quite as fun as it could be as they neglected to bring any music.  I discussed the seating plan with one of the secretaries yesterday and it looks like during my first eleven days I will sit at no less than four different desks.  My coworkers seem to be a good enough bunch, but then I should re-stress the fact that 'nobody's shouted at me'.  When this happens I'll probably think them all bastards, but for now I like them.  Bumped into the girlfriend of one my old coursemates last week, which was a bit of a shock as I'd forgotten she worked for the company.  I think she had the worst of it however, as she hadn't been told I had started working there and she was forced to spend the rest of the lunch hour with me.  What else has happened in the week or two since I last blogged?  Well, I moved house.  I'm now living in a tiny little bedsit just shy of the town centre.  To say that this place is basic, is to suggest levels of complexity that just do not exist: it is a bedroom with a sink, an oven and a fridge in one corner and a basin in the other.  That's it.  The furniture that came with the room is old and brown, and I've not been here long enough to make it look like anything over than a small room in which someone stores old furniture.  The new town is a mystery.  As far as I can tell there isn't really any reason for its existence.  It's a large town, yet there is an ever-present feeling that  nothing ever happens here .  The student population is small, which I guess I could be feeling, but I'm not actually part of that population anymore.  I'm part of the bus-catching, laundrette-using, tie-wearing population that, on the whole, seems friendly and relaxed.  That said, I want to avoid becoming part of that work-eat-sleep-work-eat-sleep-work mentality if I can.  Shit, I'm rambling again.  What else?  The town seems to have its share of attractive women, yet it also seems to have a large mutant population as well.  Walking through the shopping centre on the weekend is like walking the streets of Old New York (or so I'd imagine).  The few pubs I've been in have been nice, but I was happy to find there are a couple of Wetherspoons should I ever feel the need for a cheap pint and a meal.  That seems to be about it . . . although I'll add more random stuff when I get the chance.  Later . . .     Curiosity    Oh, yeah.  Almost forgot.   Curiosity  was runner-up for Editor's Choice (September Submissions) at the  Zoo .  Even though I didn't get the EC, I'm still pretty stoked: there was a nice, encouraging review from the editor and even a couple of suggestions on where to send it out when I get around to rewriting.  Doing minimalist happy dancing as I type this :)  In other writing related news: whilst I was without my computer last week I wrote the first draft of a short story currently called  He Missed the Sea  and worked a little more on  Pound Store .

         Luggage Rack Girl     I've spent the last week packing and preparing for my move to Swindon.  I am not a stress-free bunny at the moment.  It's essentially down to the three day wait I'm having to endure on mail that originates from the city of Nottingham.  This has made securing funds for the rental of my new digs nigh on impossible.  The rental of the bedsit I found last week is proving to be a fun-packed experience all of its very own as my estate agent has decided allowing me to move in  before  I start work would just be silly.  Okay, that's my whinge over with.  Aside from all of that, I'm very excited about starting work and actually having some money.  I don't really know what to expect from the work, but I'm sure once I get into the swing, things will be pretty cool.  After four months of living in Limbo-by-the-Sea with my parents, I'm also looking forward to living on my own again.  That is, of course, if I ever get up there :)  Later . . .    Buxom Boys Big Day Out   Because of the Move and the Job I'm going to be off the internet for a few days.  I've got to suss out what the internet situation is going to be at work, so it'll be the middle of next week before I reply to any email.  Just a warning to any who think I might be ignoring them.  Likewise, I'm unlikely to be updating the blog in a while.  Later . . .

         Ta ocras orm!  Tu faighim moran bia!     I've just finished Cecilia Dart-Thornton's  The Ill-Made Mute .  What a brilliant book.  Definitely goes on my list as one of the best books I've read this year.   Get it  (at  amazon.co.uk ) or visit  Cecilia Dart-Thornton's web presence     They Taste Like Burning     Preparations for the move and the new job continue on at a snails pace, despite my telling myself to knuckle down and work every morning when I get up.  I blame it on a recent purchase of  Warcraft III , which has been eating into my time slowly but voraciously.  That's just an excuse of course; the more accurate version of things is that I'm just weak-willed.  If it wasn't  Warcraft  then it would be  Worms World Party  (Which I rediscovered when my brother recently visited -- the game only ever exists when you have someone to play it with) or  Baldur's Gate II .  I have also discovered the Warcraft World Editor, which, for a nerd like me, is just too much fun to play with.  Suffice it to say that I got very little packing or writing done in the days since my last update, both jobs are more important than building a new expansion town or killing a few more orcs.  I did have a few ideas for the November Challenge at the SFF 'shop.  I'm throwing them around for now, seeing which bits I can take from which ideas and so on, so I may try and start writing that in the next couple of days.  Of course, as any one who has read this before knows, my challenge ideas rarely ever make it to the challenge so don't hold me to anything I say here.  Expect to hear that I have started writing it on the 29th of this month (for the start date of the 1st of November) and that I have finished it by about Christmas.  Later . . .

         'Cos it's my Birthday, My B-B-B-Birthday     It was my birthday yesterday!  Whilst I had a good time on both the birthday celebrations on Saturday (a return to Fusion Squared followed by a special birthday-themed hangover), and the few drinks I had at a leaving do last night (for one of the Crabs, even though I don't really know the guy), I can't help but feel that 23 is a non-event.  I feel myself turning into the kind of person who doesn't celebrate birthdays, who despairs at being reminded of getting older, and it worries me.  I would like to think it continues to mean something when you're twenty-four or forty-seven or seventy-two.  I  would like to think I will still see it as a reason to go out and do something special (and it need not always be drink until I black out...just for the near future).  It's all good though.  Needless to say, I haven't got a lot of writing done this weekend.  The next couple of days look to be equally unproductive as I'm getting ready for the move to my new job (13 days and counting); tomorrow is going to be spent shopping and on Thursday I'm walking around the new town looking for somewhere to live.  Should be fun.  I guess I could get some writing done on the journeys but I'll probably end up staring at a blank page from start to finish.  Older . . .

         Yarn     Sorry there's not been an entry for the past week, but then I've not really done anything since last Wednesday.  I've been too busy, or rather too lazy, to get any writing done.  Also, now I'm trying to find somewhere to live, I find the House Hunt is taking up all of my time.  My brother, Dan, is visiting, and that isn't helping either.  I know in doesn't sound like much of an excuse, but he keeps appearing everytime I open up one of my writing files or something that needs to be reviewed.  Last Saturday night I went to a golden wedding anniversary party, held for my grandparents and my great aunt and uncle who had a joint wedding fifty years ago.  I imagine two couples getting married on the same day and still being together fifty years later is fairly rare, and I was glad to be part of the celebrations.  Both of the couples certainly seemed to enjoy themselves.  It was nice to see some of my more distant relatives again, even if the majority of them called me Daniel until somebody put them straight.  It was a good night, but my reason for mentioning it is the fact I wasted the next day recovering from the event.  I rather foolishly ate too little, drank too much and my chances of getting anything done on Sunday were small.  Later . . .

         Get off me, Mr. President     Not a lot to report since my last offering, and I apologise.  I've been working.  Not much of an excuse, I know, but there has been some progress.  I've made a start to  Chapter 8  of  Dearest . . . .  That has been put on hold until I work out how I want the argument between Kiara and Jonathon to go.  In the meantime, I've also started work on my piece for the December Challenge at the Zoo.  I had an idea concerning a cat, now I've just got to see how it turns out.  That's about it.

         Very Wet Rain     Finished  Chapter 7  of  Dearest . . .  this weekend, adding another seven hundred words.  As it stands however it'll probably lose a lot in the rewrite as there's a disproportionate amount of description in there; it takes Kiara about twelve pages to walk the length of a corridor, and that's never good.  I also think the writing's probably a bit lazy as well as it's the first time I've been back to the book in ages.  Still, the chapter's finished and that's what counts.

Oh, but I can't wait until I get my internet access sorted out at home.  It'll make this (and the workshop, and the MLs) so much easier, than my current grab five minutes at the beginning and end of each day.

         Do you Like to Read?  I Just got a Great Book on Tape     Just read the horrorshop newsletter in which it was announced they are to be merging with the zoo in the next month or so.  I can't decide whether this is a good or bad thing.  I suppose it's good if it means I'll only have to concentrate on one workshop, and there's one less url to remember, but . . . it takes away the horror specific audience for my horror stuff.  Opens up the doors to more of those first-crit grabbers who write small reviews for the double points.  I'm not bothered really -- my horror membership will be tacked on to the end of the sff membership, so I'll get another six months -- but I get the impression there are some people who aren't best pleased.

If I still owe you a crit, I apologise, but I will get back to you as soon as I come back up in the new year.  All that's left to say is: merry christmas and a happy new year.  Have a good one.

         You won't be seeing any prison movies where you're going...prison     Wooo!  Another four reviews written last night.  Damn, I'm getting good at this 'being motivated' malarky.  Incidentally, during my crit marathon I came across another brilliant story.  I feel like I'm jumping late onto a band wagon here, because I've known  John Borneman  on the list for a while, have heard people heaping praise at his feet for a while now, but have never read anything he's written.  It's a shame really, because he's  good .  I don't think my crit did his piece justice, but hopefully he won't mind.  If you're a member of the  OWW , check out John's story  A Melody of Brass .    Spell His Ass Off     Well,  Tymmy 's been up at the workshop for over a week now and he seems to be really enjoying himself up there.  It's getting some good reviews, and so far no one's said to me 'passive voice is not your friend'.  People seem to like it.  This makes me happy.  It's got something like half a dozen reviews already, which is a lot more than I usually get.  I'd like to think it's because I'm actually putting more effort into reviewing than I have in the past, but it's probably just a by-product of the challenge.  I'm still happy :)

         Near Cliche Experience   I had the hangovers to beat all hangovers on Saturday morning.  You'd think I'd know by now that, even for someone with my tolerance to alcohol, mixing both variants of wine with a lot of beer is not wise.  Still a good time was had, and I survived my first office christmas party without any really embarrassing incidents (at least, none I wish to repeat here).

         If it dangles, we'll punch a hole in it     Didn't get as much done last night as I would have liked -- I was too busy watching that Scouse cop getting sliced and diced on  The Bill .  I did manage to get another crit written though.  In an attempt to get into the Christmas spirit we're running a little competition up on North First.  The idea is that people submit three clues about themselves and then everyone has to guess who the clues refer to.  After spending an afternoon racking my brain I couldn't think of anything remotely remarkable about myself (we were told to think of things that were interesting and that nobody else in the office knew).  I eventually settled for 'writes short fiction', so I guess my dirty little secret is out.  Not only that, but on Friday I'll see the proof I am in fact the most boring person in our office.  Seb put that he was nearly struck by lightning for crying out loud.  Of course, I was tempted to make something up as no one would be any the wiser, but I wussed out in the end.  I had quite a list of them in the end.   Writes erotica under the name Moose Hornshank; Has a pair of lucky pants; Once had a fork waved in his face; Is the most decorated snowboarder in WX history; Is serving as Dean of Elections . . .

         I'll show him.  I'll bring you a weapon of unimaginable destructive power     Reviewed another of the blindness stories last night.  The ones I've read so far have been very good (particularly Hannah Bowen's  Writing on the Wall  -- if you're one of the zoo check it out).  Aside from that, I made some more changes to  Thanks for Listening , although nothing much more than rewriting sentences.  The reviews I have received so far for  Tymmy  have been favourable.  I'm quite pleased with that seeing as I only wrote the story for the sake of the challenge.  Later . . .

         What's the Point in Living if I can't Say 'Ass'?     The results from the karting are back and -- somehow -- I managed to get two points.  Not only that, but where I had been certain I had come last, there was still ten people below me.  Teamleader Louise was in amongst those ten as well, so I'm happy.  It means I wasn't the worst person on our team :)  Yay.  And I also beat Fran.  After reading that last paragraph again, I'm convinced the karting people have made a mistake.  Our team, Kamakartzy, came twelth out of eighteen.  There was a picture accompanying the results and, as soon as I get my web-hosting sorted out, I'll post it.  We all look dead sexy in our overalls :)

         Everything's Coming up Milhouse     Went to see Seb's band, the Carter Affair, on Friday Night.  It was pretty good, although it was a little irritating being surrounded by school children all night.    Soft as a Velvet Child     Surprisingly, I've had a bit of a productive weekend.  Even more surprising is the fact I spent two of the evenings out drinking.  On Saturday afternoon I managed to clock up three reviews for challenge pieces at the  workshop .  Yesterday I looked through the first draft of  Thanks for Listening  in an attempt to identify the weaknesses and problems.  I've got a couple of ideas of what to do with it, although it seems to boil down to a perspective problem in the final scene.  I'm thinking of doing the reworking when I'm back in the Sticks for Christmas, as it's something I can sit down to without too much hassle.  Later . . .

         That's not a Gadget, That's Just Monstrous Use of a Biro     Today is the day the two workshops were due to merge.  Time to roll out the red carpet and welcome the dark and sinister reprobates of the horror'shop into our fold.  Of course, I was one of those reprobates, but since I only ever subbed one piece to the horror'shop ( The Well ) I don't think I'm quite as corrupted as the others.  Hope the transition goes well for Ellen and co and that none of the horror crowd scares anyone too badly . . .  . . . at least, not outside their fiction.    If it's a Lesson in Love, Watch Out.  I Suffer From a Very Sexy Learning Disorder     Well,  Tymmy  has been redrafted and posted to the  sci-fi, fantasy  and horror  workshop .  Now I just have to wait for the reviews to roll in.  One thing that I've learned from this challenge, and I guess that is the real point of the whole thing, is how bloody hard it is to write without being able to fall back on those comfortable visual descriptions.  I realise now that I don't know how to describe  anything  in the other four senses.  I kept using 'it smelled' or 'the sound of' or 'it felt' or similar such weak-ass constructs, and when I was looking over it I realised how poor it was.  I think I got rid of most of them, but we'll soon find out.  I've enjoyed taking part in this challenge.  I think I'd like to try writing something to these rules again, as I've still got a lot to learn.  If another idea comes to me, one with as much potential as the one I've just written, I may just do that.  My skills could definitely develop further.  Later . . .

         He's Just Playing Wiggle Puppy     Finished the blindness story yesterday, adding another 450 words, but I've decided to hold onto it for another day before I submit it.  The version I've got is very rough, and I wanted to have another look at it tomorrow night to see if I can spot anything obviously wrong with it.  If I can get a headstart on the inevitable comments of 'passive voice is not your friend' and 'this is too long' then maybe I could turn this piece into a halfway decent story.  The story's called  Tymmy , named for the cat we had to have put to sleep this summer.  In case anyone's curious about the strange spelling, I made a typo the first time I was spelling Timmy and I just liked the look of it.  I shall probably change it.  I also critted, but the piece I looked at seems to have vanished from the workshop.  Grr.  Later . . .

          Tymmy      I spent most of Sunday working on my entry for the blindness story, and wrote quite a bit, but . . . I didn't manage to get it finished.  Aaaaaaarrrgghh.  This means I'm going to be a couple of days late submitting, but as they keep reminding us the challenge is open all month.  I'll get it up tomorrow, I should think.  Meanwhile, I've got to get the other challenge pieces so I've got something to review this week.    I Feel the Need, the Need for Mead   It was the work trip to the Go Karting track on Friday night.  I think, judging by my performance and the way I actually managed to reduce our team's score, we can safely say that I was  not  born to race.  They had an electronic leader table up, and over the course of the night I watched with mounting dismay as I languished at the bottom of the table, and then, right at the end, managed to drop off it altogether.  The reason for this was a little incident in my third and final heat when I tail-ended the guy in front of me on the first corner, for which I got penalised three points.  I think the decision was a little unjust, but I was more interested in escaping the hangar and finding a bar with a late license than complaining.  For the rest of the evening I drove my little go kart like Marge Simpson ('slow and steady wins the race').  I crashed in my first two heats, and the first time I was held back from re-entering the race until a couple of guys lapped me.  Embarrassing as that was, it pales next to the fact that one of the guys lapping me was a team-mate.  My racing prowess aside, go-karting was surprisingly good fun (I'd not really done it before and had been quietly dreading it all week).  Now I've done it, I can't wait to do it again.  Some of the guys in my office have mentioned making another trip out there some time, so we could actually race against each other, and providing I can raise my game a little I might even offer them a challenge.  What else?  Slow and steady wins the race?  Slow and steady gets lapped into next week.    Don't Open it, Ralph, I'll Just Give you a C-     There's been a spat of 'woohoo's announced on the mailing lists recently; it seems as if everybody has managed to sell something.  I'm incredibly jealous, even though I don't really have a right to be until I send a piece of mine out.  Congratulations to all of those who found homes for writing in the last couple of weeks.  Keep up the good work.  Later . . .

         Busy, busy, busy   Got my first   at the workshop yesterday.  Means that in my time there (just over a year if I count it right), I've contributed fifty reviews.  Wow.  This seems like a big number, but then I realise it's less than one a week, so maybe the count is a little low.  When the Literary Conventions were still up and running I was doing upwards of eight reviews a month.  Still, I've got a bee next to my name now.  I'm half tempted to resolve to get that second bee before the end of the year, even though it means doing another hundred reviews in the next eleven months.  At this current moment in time -- when I seem to be reviewing more than I'm writing -- I actually believe I could do it.  Hell, I'll give it a go, I guess.  Other than that, not a lot to report.  That last crit took me two nights to write, and last night was spent watching the football with some of the lads from work.  I've been spending the last few nights thinking about the website, and whether or not I want to redesign it when I finally get it back up and running.  Later . . .

         There's a Tool Wrench in There if you Need it   The manuscript was dropped in the post on Saturday morning.  It is out there in the ether.  I've been surprisingly nervous about this.  I'm telling myself not to worry: it's out there now, and there's nothing I can do about it.  The worst that can happen?  It'll come back in a couple of months, I'll get depressed for a while, and then I'll send it back out.  I must admit I didn't feel like much of a professional on Saturday morning, carrying my manuscript into town in a carrier bag.  I didn't want it to get wet in the rain.  The guy behind the post office counter gave me a funny look when he read the address on the envelope (noting the word 'Editor', no doubt), but he didn't say anything.  I've since worked out that, even if they do accept my story, I will make a loss.  Amusing, this publication pays $5/story (which'll work out at about 3), but I've already paid 3.73 in postage.  Just as well I'm not trying to make a living out of this :)     Even the News Monster is Acting Strange     On Friday night and Saturday night I added 550 words to, and finished,  Chapter 8  of  Dearest . . .   Yay me!  I'm almost into double figures on my novel chapters.  And it's only taken me two years so far.  Hmmm.  I'd best go get some more writing done.  Later . . .

         Why Does Art Hate Me?  I've Never Done Anything to Art     My trip with the lads to Dublin has been cancelled.  Mere hours after I booked the time off yesterday, I received a phonecall from Mat, to say he was calling it off due to the rest of the guys sacking it.  Shame.     Just Because I Don't Care it Doesn't Mean I Don't Understand     Well, I've redesigned this page again.  I got bored with the old look and I'm trying to work my way around a block at the moment, and web stuff is something I can pretty much do on autopilot.  I'll update the look next week when I finally get my website rehosted and get infinitewhite.net back online.  I've only managed to get about 6oo words down this month, and they were chunky and uninspired additions to my Work in Progress.  You know you're in trouble you read over your most recent stuff and discover no less than three descriptions of the noise a kettle makes.  I've highlighted everything I've done since the beginning of the year, and I'm more than tempted to just press delete.  This --   'I haven't been avoiding you,' he said finally.  The anger was returning and coffee splashed over the edges of the cups as he picked them up.  'If you remember, I never really spoke to you before we . . . before we --'   -- was the best of two and a half pages.  There is some good news, however.  I have printed a copy of  The Well  (on the printers at work -- naughty me).  Tomorrow morning I'm going to go straight to the post office and send it off.  I don't want to wait any more -- I feel if I dawdle or drag my feet in any way, I'll still be talking about posting it in a month's time.  More news on Monday.     P.S. Please excuse the missing images, but I've got nowhere to host them until I get my website back up.  Next week, I promise.  It'll look really sweet.

         Please Fear my Wrath     I spent the last four days looking for markets for  The Well .  I've found a few that sound to want something similar to my story (or at least what I percieve my story to be).  I've got a list, so now I've just got to look to see where it wants to go first.  What surprises me -- and kind of disappoints me, if I'm totally honest -- is the number of places that want fiction under 5ooo words.   The Well  runs at 5o5o.  I don't want to push my luck with any editors, so they've been scratched from the list.  It's just as well I'm not sending the first draft off: that ran to 8k, and would have left me with about two places to send it.  Later . . .

         The Inevitable 2oo2 Summary   Before anyone says anything -- I know this is almost two weeks late, but I haven't had a chance to get this down since I returned from the sticks.  2oo2 was a mixed year I suppose: my finals at uni and settling in to my new home and job, meant that, at times, I was so busy I hardly got any writing done.  On the other hand . . . I had a three month period of unemployment in the middle of that, and the only reason I didn't get many words done was laziness.  I got a few chapters of  Dearest . . .   written, a lot less than I would have liked.  I wrote seven new short stories.  I'm proud to varying levels of all of them, but my favourites are  Curiosity  and  Tymmy .  I hope I can convince some editors of their worth when I finally get around to sending them out.  And that's the rub, I didn't send  anything  out this year.  So that leads me on to my resolutions for 2oo3.  Only two of them really apply to my writing, so I'll leave the rest out: 1. Improve the quality of my writing and my skill at the craft; and 2. Get something published.  There were others but as they weren't about writing, I won't bore you with them :)  As for targets, how about we say 5ooo words a month, seeing as the 75oo I tried last year didn't work out.  If I stay committed, that should give me about 6o ooo words by the end of the year.  Thinking about that, I'm going to amend that last bit and say that I want at least of half of those words to be on my Work in Progress.  I'd go the whole hog and say I want to finish the novel, but I doubt I could work through the year without at least one more writer's block.  Later . . .    I Want to Play in the Mud and be a Hippy     Since writing the above addition on Sunday, I've made what I  hope  will be the final revision of  The Well .  I've been making changes for the past month or so, and it looks as good as it's ever going to get.  The plan now is to sit on it for a week or so, whilst I nip over to Ralan's to find a home for it, and have a quick final read before sending it off to whoever I decide to send it off to.  I'm half tempted to not look at it again before sending it out, but I don't think I could live with myself knowing that I hadn't performed one last sweep for typos and grammatical slip-ups.  If I can convince some of my friends to proof it for me, I might forego doing it myself.  I don't really know.  Well, I'm almost ready to make my first submission, and actually take a step towards that second resolution.  Keep your eyes on this spot for further updates.  Later . . .

         Even your Dreams are Square   Maybe  Tymmy  isn't quite ready to go out yet.  The first person who critted it for me didn't even get the fact that the cat is supposed to be blind.  You've got to worry when someone says they can visualise everything your blind PoV character is seeing :)  Seriously though, I'm not too worried at the moment.  If more people fail to get it then maybe I'll look at it again.

         The Sidewalk's for Regular Walking, Not Fancy Walking   I was in town on Saturday morning, idly browsing my way around Waterstone's, when I decided to see who I would be next to on the shelves if I ever get a novel published.  It was somewhat daunting to discover that in the Science Fiction and Fantasy section I would be snuggled between J.V. Jones and Robert Jordan.  I laughed out loud, causing the girl driving the till to look over in my direction.  I went to hide behind a bookshelf until someone bought something.  Not to worry, I thought, the novel you're working on at the moment is Horror.  The Horror section wasn't much better: James Herbert on one side and Stephen King on the other.  Yeah.  Nice.  It has since occured to me that there are other sections.  Next time I go to Waterstone's I'm going to have to see where I would stand in the Crime or Romance or Fiction sections.  Maybe I could even take Al's advice and see what potential lies in the Adult section.     Can Everybody Just Notice How Much Fire I'm Not On   So what have I got done this weekend?  Well, I've made some revisions to  Tymmy  with a mind to getting it sent out next week sometime.  I haven't listened to everything that was suggested for it, but I've made a few changes that should make it a better story.  I've put it back up at the  workshop  to pick up some last minute comments whilst I hit the web to find somewhere to send it.  As before, keep to this spot for news.  Some small news: I've started  Dearest . . .  again.  This will be the third draft.  Remember that organic writing progress I got so excited about before?  Well, it didn't work.  I found myself losing track of characters and time (I'm not even sure what month the action was in when I last finished writing, and I think the diary extracts may as well have had random dates attached to them for the real ones were about as accurate).  I found that it was a chore to go back to it each time.  I'd come back to it after a month or so off and absolutely dread having to look back and remind myself where everybody was.  I also didn't have any clue how my main characters were going to reach the end of  Part 1 , and I still had a few chapters left to run in that part.  So it was all going nowhere and I also feel I need to detach my own experiences at Nottingham from the book, else I'm in danger of writing a very short, yet incomplete, autobiographical account of my degree course.  With any luck, this new draft should work a lot better for me.  Same targets apply as they did before - six (new) chapters by the end of the year (although I hope to get a  lot  more than that down).     A Professional in a Monkey Mask is Still a Professional   No word back from  The Well  yet, but it has only been two weeks.  A tense two weeks, but it's still too early to expect to hear anything yet.  The publication's quoted response time was two months after all.  Later . . .

        Not a lot done this weekend, due to spending a large proportion of the weekend sat around talking about nothing much.  I think I've actually met someone who can give Student With No Razor a run for his money :)  The rest of my time was spent watching the rugby and celebrating the result (England are Six Nation champions -- Grand Slam finally -- trounced Ireland 6-42 -- best team in the world, or so they say).  I'll try and get a bit more done this week.  Oh, yes, and Elydian finally has himself a  blog  up and running.  Click the link to find out that everything sucks :)  ***** SPOILER FOR MISERY (the book) BY STEPHEN KING:  ***  **  *  She cut his foot off!  Muuuurrhhh!  Okay, breathe in.  I just about get over that . . . altho' I spent the night scratching my left foot with the toes of my right, checking it was there.  I'm not usually a squeamish person, but legs and feet are the major exception.  Gets me everytime.  So yeah, I get over it, and then  She cut his thumb off!  Muuuurrhhh!  Still, it was a good book.  *  **  ***  ***** END OF SPOILER  Next: a book by Ben Elton, the name of which totally escapes me (I wouldn't normally read Ben Elton, as I think he's a bit of a git, but it came with Student With No Razor's recommendation, and not liking the person is no reason not to read the book) and  Krondor: Tear of the Gods  by Raymond E. Fiest.

        This, it seems, is the way of my replotting process at the moment: by the time I get home, cook dinner (I say cook, but it's nothing quite so fancy), iron a shirt, have a bath, and review whatever's in my pile I usually have enough time to detail one scene.  This book's going to take me all year to plot at this rate, let alone actually write.  Weekends, that's the way forwards.  If I can just bring myself to stay in Swin for a weekend I might actually make some progress.  Am currently reading  Misery  by Stephen King, a book I've wanted to read for years.  It's probably been the King book that's been most recommended to me when people found out that I read him.  So far it's turning out pretty good.  Later . . .

        I had myself something of a revelation about the re-plotting I'm doing for  Dearest . . .  on the walk home from work yesterday.  I think I may have a way to sort out some of the problems I'm having in working out how the characters are getting from here to there.  It may work, and it's so deceptively simple a move that I spent the rest of the evening kicking myself for not spotting it earlier.  As is always the case when such revelations strike, I had neither pen nor paper on me.  So I was forced to send myself a text message containing the important details.  If I hadn't made some sort of note I would have surely forgotten about how it was to go about.  Luckily, I'm used to the funny looks I recieve when I suddenly stop in the street and start texting on my phone even though it has made no noise.  I'm thankful that the new phone I bought on Friday has predictive text, for now it means I'm standing in the way for a lot less time.  In other news, I finished  Dune  again.  Damned if I can remember that ending though.  Worries me slightly; did I even finish the first time round, or am I just losing my memory prematurely?  I'm fairly sure I must have finished it because I wrote the aforementioned book report, but even so . . .  And, I've been seconded to the wastewater group at work.  Wouldn't be so bad if we hadn't been completely mistaught the whole subject at Uni.  Looks like I've a fun couple of months ahead.  Tomorrow: pipe wrapping.  Later . . .

         Don't Smile, You've Broken Your Neck     No real writing news to report.  After garnering some reviews of the second draft of  Tymmy , I've taken it down from the 'shop.  It needs a lot more work before I can even think about sending it out, methinks.  The reviews were encouraging, and they should be quite helpful when I get around to the rewrite.  I haven't written anything new for a while.   Dearest . . .  continues to sit in the corner and growl at me.  The replotting process plods on.  I've spent a lot of time reading this past couple of weeks.  Having recently finished  Quest for Lost Heroes  by David Gemmell (I'm really getting into Gemmell's stuff -- that makes it four of the Drenai novels I've read so far, and I've enjoyed every one) and Pratchett and Gaiman's  Good Omens , I've now started to reread  Dune .  I first read that book for a book report back at KS&CC, and wanted to finish the series for many a year.  It's being a fun experience so far -- I have forgotten so much about the book that it surprises me.  I seem to be reading from a different angle as well (with my head tilted just so . . . :) as I'm noticing all these little details about plot and foreshadowing and characterisation that I'm sure I wouldn't have noticed ten or more years ago.  (i think the book report when something along the lines of, 'dune is really cool.  there are these big worms and this funky spice that turns your eyes blue'.  i wish i still had it, as i'm really interested to know what i thought of it, and how much effort i put in to it.  i suspect, since i never really had any love of english when i was school, that it wasn't much effort, but there you go.  i have an unsettling idea that i drew a picture of a sandworm on the first page)  As for the much postponed redesign of this webpage, I have had some difficulties with my webhosts.  It seems to be sorted out now, but I'm unsure whether or not to get internet access in the grotty bedsit or not.  For now, I think I'm going to have to do an Axl Rose and put it off yet again.  It will look really sweet, though.

        I'm back from my Easter break in Limbo, feeling refreshed.  I would have updated this thing yesterday, but after it took me over two and a half hours to get to work (when it normally takes me little under 40 minutes) everything else I did was a bit of a mad panic.  I had just enough time to notice that  The Well  has been rejected again.  A little happier this time; the rejection e was personal, with some useful comments,  and  it ended with 'Feel free to submit here again'.  He may not have liked my story, but it appears he would be willing to read my stuff in the future.  This is always nice to know.   The Well  gets rejected faster than I can send stuff out.  I can't keep up.  I do little writing 'cos I seem to spend so much time searching the markets.  I made a list of possible recipients last night (having printed up the 'paying' page at  ralan's ) and intended to narrow it down at work today.  I left the list at home, so I guess it'll have to be done tomorrow.  So what else have I been up to?  I finished reading  A Game of Thrones  by George R.R. Martin (about the only thing I did finish on my holiday, my writing drive was grossly underattempted).   A Game . . .  was good, huge in scope and potential, and I don't know if I can wait to see how the story turns out.  I've now started reading Stephen King's latest short story collection  Everything's Eventual .  Odd summary of the stories when I finish it proper.  Have been unable to think of a decent idea for the blood challenge, so I'll be missing the challenge this month.  My muse went on holiday at the same time I did.  Nevermind, best get back to work :)

         The Well  was rejected on Tuesday night, after being out at the relevant publication for only three days.  This is my first real rejection (after the first market I sent it to was closed) and, surprisingly, I'm not as upset as I expected to be.  Sure, it still smarts to be rejected.  I'm not sure whether I had just conditioned myself to get the rejection, or whether the speed of the response has meant it hasn't sunk in yet, but it doesn't hurt like I imagine it would have twelve months ago.  I'm just carrying on with life.  I've dusted off the story (as it was a form rejection I don't really have anything to work with) and this morning I sent it out to another market.  Fingers crossed.  Maybe it'll hurt more when I've got another dozen rejections under my belt.  I hope not.  I haven't written anything recently, and I certainly didn't get anything done whilst I was at Mat's wedding this weekend (taking the A4 pad was pure folly and I realise that now).  I meant to write down a few words about the wedding -- highlights of the weekend, best wishes to the happy couple, the incident when Paul's Vitara caught on fire -- but I've been so busy this week I just haven't got round to it.  Maybe later.  Finally, I'm going back to the Sticks for Easter weekend and the week that follows, and that means I'll be away from this thing until the 28th of the month at the earliest.  Looking forward to going back.  My parents have brought a new puppy (a labrador and, altho' I'm not entirely sure of the colour, I suspect it's a black one) called Widgeon, so that will need lots of pampering and looking after I'm sure.  I have also got a few nights out planned with the KS&CC Alumni, which should be good.  Also, as it's Rugby Weekend I'll be watching lots of rugby (altho' the highlight of the week is the 7s tournament) and drinking lots of beer.  Can't wait.

        Nothing done last night.  RE called and we took a trip to the distant past (or Chisledon, as it's more commonly known) and met up with a couple of our group who are actually stranded there.  By the time I got back it was midnight.  Was in no mood to even read, let alone write, so it was straight to bed.  And I've just found out that the market I submitted  The Well  to back in January has been closed due to illness.  Apparently I should expect a form response in the post.  Does this count as a rejection?  I don't know, but I'm going to say for the sake of numbers that it is.  Damn.

        Whilst there's no denying that  Dead Famous  is funny, I'm finding it harder and harder to go back to each evening.  I don't know why, as it's not a bad book, but there isn't the pressing desire to find out what happens next, or the development of any relationship with the main characters.  It's almost as if Elton has managed his satire so well, taken the piss out of the characters so well, that you find you don't actually like any of them.  At all.  Take Colleridge, for example.  You should find him endearing, an old-fashioned copper investigating a crime in a world he doesn't understand.  Instead his confusion at everything everybody says, his complete ignorance of popular culture, is just irritating.  How can anyone not know what 24-7 means?  Or at least make an educated guess at its meaning?  Two reviews written Tuesday night, both of which were rescue crits when I downloaded them.  Didn't quite get around to them quick enough to earn those double points, but I like to think I'm doing my bit for the drive to keep under-reviewed subs down to zero.  Probably a good thing that I didn't take part in the crit marathon, as I've only done two reviews and we're already eight days in.  Gah.  Unfortunately, I wasted last night, as I worked out how to complete an area in Icewind Dale II that had been stolidly defeating me.  The mad rush at work caused by my fuck up has passed, to be replaced with a limbo-like state.  I have plenty of jobs to do, but because the urgency of last week has gone I don't actually feel as if I've started anything.  I'm not complaining, but I do seem to be wasting time between jobs, taking overly long lunchbreaks ect.  Yesterday afternoon I managed to spend the last hour talking to people, killing time until the next bus arrived.  The soc people here at work are organising a bowling night in May sometime.  Looking forward to recreating the dope skills I showed last time I went.  Despite my reputation as someone who bowls like Monty Burns, I'm on a team with the lunchtime crew.

        Has been hectic at work this past couple of days.  It must be the pipework, because all of a sudden I'm channelling Naomi Tyack with alarming accuracy.  I'm fucking up about once every two seconds, I know nothing about what I'm doing and I can see those around me rapidly losing patience.  I'm not quite up to Tyack's high standards yet -- I've thus far avoided using 48 point font in any of my calculations, and haven't handed anyone a map for a task, blissfully unaware of the canal that crosses the length of the map and that will make the task impossible to complete -- but I feel myself getting close.  And you know the funny thing?  I'm going to be on this until August at least.  Tried to get some reviewing done this last couple of nights, but I seem to be failing badly.  Two nights on one submission and I'm only halfway through.  Needless to say I haven't got any writing done either.  What have I been doing?  Certainly not going out, and there's been nothing on the telly to adequately distract me.  Hmmm.  Puzzling.

         Kevin Doesn't . . . really give you a choice; you almost have to dance   The move in to Si's approaches and DF (who is also moving in with us -- he moved a double bed into the lounge on Monday) has been telling everyone that 'It's like  Friends '.  DF's given himself the identity of Joey in this analogy, unsurprisingly.  I guess I'm happy with being Chandler.  It's the one I would have picked for myself, although I'm less of a funny guy and more of a 'piss-taking bastard' (as Wes so kindly points out).  I suppose it beats being Ross.  No work to report, as I'm still packing and tidying up the grotty bedsit.

         There is a Waffle Emergency in the Subway   Last couple of nights were spent in pre-packing work.  You know, that time where you go through all your stuff without actually putting any of it in to boxes, throwing away what you can and making piles and remaking piles and gathering all the piles together when you realise you haven't finished but you need your bed to sleep in.  The professional cleaner is booked for next week.  Don't know how much I like the idea of a man who cleans residential properties for a living.  I keep expecting Mr. Muscle to turn up at the grotty bedsit tomorrow, some skinny in vest and shorts, all thick-rimmed glasses and thicker hair.  Whatever happens I must resist the impulse to ask the guy if he loves the jobs I hate.  Received a postcard from Matt and Caroline yesterday, from where they stayed on their honeymoon.  It looked quite nice.  They thanked me for being at the wedding and said it was the 'best day of their lives'.  I have another cousin.  Yay!  My uncle's girlfriend gave birth to a boy (Harrison) in the early hours of this morning.  Happy dancin' for them.  I've just sent  The Well  out again.  Cross fingers.  Stats update (seeing as I've been so lame in updating the look of this thing): New Chapters -- 1; New Stories -- 0; Words -- 6650; Stories in Circulation -- 1; Rejections -- 3 (one half rejection due to illness); Acceptances -- 0.

        Started another couple of reviews this weekend, but the cottage was just too darned busy to get any writing down.  I tried, but the visiting relatives and well-wishers (ricochets from saturday night's party} made it difficult.  If one more person approaches where I sit staring at a pad of paper and asks what I'm doing, I swear I'm going to scream.  Still, I'm back now.  Haven't been back to the grotty bedsit, as DF gave me a lift up from the Sticks this morning, but I'm sure it's where, and how, I left it.  May get something done tonight, like typing up the reviews I started, but I have some packing stuff to start as well . . .  (Eight days to go)  . . . so we'll see how that goes.  Incidentally, the party on Saturday night went well.  Amazingly, we managed to fit fifty people in the lounge/kitchen of the cottage, and at no point did it seem too crowded.  Irritatingly, I was called Snip all night.  Drunkenly, we polished off a disgusting amount of wine, but made hardly a dent in the food.  Annoyingly, I was sleeping on the landing when I was woken my Angela downstairs beginning the post-party clean up, and unable to sleep through the clattering had to give her a hand (the rest of our guests woke mere minutes after we finished the job -- funny that).

        Oh yeah, yesterday was my Dad's fiftieth birthday.  Although I forgot to mention it here, I didn't forget to call him or send his card out.  Big party back in Limbo this weekend when we see just how many people we can cram into our house.  Last I heard we were expecting 45 people.  Where they're all going to park is anyone's guess.  Nothing much done last night because I was looking for somewhere to live.  The landlady I had called a few days back, who seems to own rooms in every other property in this town, took me round a few houses.  None of them look too bad and all were fairly cheap.  The landlady doesn't seem to mind me moving in at short notice, which could be useful (12 days and counting).  I've also found out that Si has a room available.  It's in the village I have sometimes referred to as the distant past, and I'm kind of reluctant to strand myself out there, but it could be alright.  If I remember rightly it was a nice house.  If he's in today I'll speak to him and see what he's asking.

         Big Boots   In a misguided attempt to get my fitness back up to scratch, I've started running again (and, no, I'm not training for anything or anyone in particular).  I can just about manage a mile, before spots start infiltrating my vision and I collapse in a shaking heap in the middle of the street.  I'm not joking.  That said, I can feel it getting easier and last night, for the first time since I started this, I actually felt good afterwards.  Yesterday I went to post the reviews I wrote over the weekend, and discovered that since I downloaded the stories one of them had been taken down, revised and reposted (and this was a challenge piece).  I hate it when people do that.  I'm not the fastest reviewer, so taking down stories whilst I'm reviewing them really winds me up (This subject is getting beaten to death on the ML at the moment, so I'll leave it at that).  Anyway, so last night, I took a look at the new version of the story (and luckily there weren't too many changes), added some more comments, and then wrote a review of another piece.  Unusually productive for me, but I had made a point of keeping the television turned off.  Am going to have to try and do this more often.  No writing done, but you can't expect miracles.  Tonight, finding somewhere to live.

        Bank holiday weekend came and went, although it wasn't quite the washout it could have been.  Despite somehow getting drawn into Q3A again I did manage to get some reviews written, and even managed a bit more plotting (notice how plotting seems to be pretty much all I'm doing these days? My motivation sucks).  Went to the cinema on my own yesterday :(  First time I've had to do that since I've been in Swin, but now that RE's gone away I've not anyone to go with.  Watched X-Men 2.  Pretty cool, imagine it would stand very well with the first film (although truth be told I can hardly remember what happened in it).  My lease is expiring, so there is only two weeks not until I can escape the Grotty Bedsit.  Yay.  I have no idea where I'm going to go, which is a little worrying, but wherever I end up, it won't be worse than where I am now.

         Story Neglect   Sat in the grotty bedsit last night, and I realised that I haven't revised  Tymmy  since the last time I put it up at the  workshop .  Smacked myself on the back of the hand; that last submission was in Febuary, which means the story's been sat on my computer for at least two months waiting to be improved.  I got so caught up in not actually getting anything done that I completely forgot about it.  Bad Kevin.  So, I had a read through the reviews I got for it.  Didn't agree with all the points, but there are some places that definitely need reworking.  Shall make a start on that, providing nothing else squeals for attention.  It gets worse though, my story neglect.  I had a bit of a nose around my hard-drive last night and discovered that  Curiosity  has unused reviews from back in December.  What have I been doing?

         Kevin Doesn't . . . grasp who handed him this Big-Apple success. Could it be . . . Satan?   (Written Tuesday, but unable to post) Far Sector SFFH rejected  The Well .  I just received what seems like a form rejection (although nice enough as they go) in my inbox.  Damn.  I've bumped it back out to another ezine, after spending a large chunk of this afternoon lurking at Ralan's.  Keep your fingers crossed.  And, because I haven't done one of these for a while: New Chapters -- 1; New Stories -- 0; Words -- 10000; Stories in Circulation -- 1; Rejections -- 4; Acceptances -- 0.  Later . . .

         Kevin Doesn't . . . mind playing down an exchange.   That said, nothing to report from the weekend.  No new writing done and I haven't even got around to typing up the stuff I did by hand when I was back in the Sticks.  Been doing too much socialising, I guess, 'cos it's not as if I've been wasting time in front of the television or anything.  Went up to Matt's this weekend for a barbecue.  Not bad, altho' I did spend the entire evening sitting in singles row again.  Going to have to put an end to that; everyone in that group is far too couply, and it can be a bit of a shackle on the evening.  Friday and Sunday both I went out for drinks locally; good altho' I spent too much money :)  Going to try and get some words down tonight.  Hopefully, there won't be too many distractions.

         Kevin Doesn't . . . like the taste of water.   (Written on Friday, but unable to post). I don't think I can write anything about Wednesday's funeral.  Not yet, I'm still trying to grab hold of something I recognise so I can pin it down somewhere.  I don't know where (here, my other journal, on a piece of paper in my room that'll never be read).  For now we're just going to have to settle for the trivial stuff, okay?  I've finished reading   Colony  by Rob Grant  (review to follow).  A couple of days ago I made a start on   The Scar  by China Miville .  It's already worming it's way into my brain, much in the manner that   Perdido Street Station   did.  Loving what I'm reading so far.  Had some ideas for the Levels of Horror contest at the zoo, although nothing too concrete yet.  Hoping I can start writing something down this weekend.

         Kevin Doesn't . . . understand general realitivity.   I was a little hasty in writing my message yesterday.  It turns out the funeral is not until next Wednesday now.  Unable to afford to take over a week off, or make two trips back home, this means that I'll be in Swin until the end of the week.  Finished   Without Fail   last night (reviewed by Scircle).  Next on the list   Colony  by Rob Grant  (yes, that's one half of the team who created  Red Dwarf ).  For the first time in a long time, I got some new words down.  Saturday to be exact.  Only a page and a half, and for the Hot Air challenge that I'll probably never take part in, but it felt good to be writing again.  First paragraph was the hardest; I couldn't say what I wanted to say.  Took me about an hour.  I'm still not entirely happy with it -- the whole thing feels too description heavy at the moment -- but it's good enough.  Later . . .

         Kevin Doesn't . . . call me all that often.   Last night I finished reading   Reaper Man  by Terry Pratchett .  Not one of his best, but the Death books have never been my favourites of the series (except the  latest , which I loved).  Next on the list:   Without Fail  by Lee Child .  Should hammer through this one fairly quickly.

         Kevin Doesn't . . . worry about the sun's damaging rays, he just concentrates on his game.   Nothing much to say.   The Well  is still out at the latest market; I've not written anything in ages, although, at the workshop, I have managed to get some critting done (and aren't I happy with myself at being able to crit when I don't even have anything posted); I have an idea for a scene (or two) for the June challenge, but am unsure whether or not to post it incomplete; I'm currently reading Terry Pratchett's  Reaper Man , and the other day, to my great joy, I noticed that WHS had a copy of  The Scar  in, so I've bought that and added it to the pile of books to be read.    Kevin Doesn't . . . know how to smile.   I moved house two weeks ago, and am now living with two others in a small two bedroom cottage in the Distant Past.  Whilst I haven't completely finished unpacking (matters haven't been helped by the satellite television in the lounge, which sings to me whenever I have a quiet moment), I've settled in and so far things are good.  The eternal quiet of the Distant Past isn't bothering me too much; it's just like being back in the Sticks, except that you're slightly less removed from civilisation here (I'm currently only four or so miles from Swin).  When I say I live with two others, this week it isn't strictly true.  We're letting another one of the local needy sleep in our lounge, so there will be four of us living in very cramped conditions.  I'm not sure of the wisdom of such a move, but if the others want to be charitable, who am I to argue?  Finally, for any who remember me mentioning the bowling a while back, an update.  I truly suck at bowling.  In fact, it might be safe to say that I am worse at bowling than I am at Karting.  In our group of six I came fourth in the first game.  In the second I came second to last out of the whole party (some 40-odd people).  If ever the Monty Burns comparisons were appropriate, it is now.  Later . . .

         Kevin Doesn't . . . have lots of money to spend on Angie.   Went to see  Hulk  last night.  Verdict: Nice looking (if somewhat unbelievable) but slow to get started.  The main reason I went to see this film was to see the green dude smash things up.  I didn't want to have to wait an hour to see him.  I had a few other gripes, but I guess I'd better put these in a spoiler space (don't want to upset anyone now).  SPOILERS > > >  There was far too much backstory in this film, especially at the beginning.  That's all it seemed it was, backstory interspersed with a few moments of CGI-enhanced rage.  Okay, we get it.  Bruce is how he is because of his father's experiments and that accident with the gamma machine.  We get it.  But no, we've got another couple of dream-sequences.  Another couple of flashbacks.  Garr.  Also, what was with that ending?  David, who's got some weird affinity with materials thing going on, goes to see his son.  He talks to son.  They fight.  David becomes a big-ass eletrical monster, then a rock monster, then a water monster, then some kind of cloud monster.  The cloud monster (doesn't sound scary, does it?  And it isn't because the whole sequence is so dark you can't make out what David Banner is most of the time) says he wants to take the Hulk's powers.  Hulk lets him.  David dies.  I still don't understand it.  Then there's some chat between Jennifer Connelly's character and her father.  Father is saying that he thinks the Hulk is dead, but should he try to contact Jennifer Connelly, she should let him know.  This is fine had we not been just told that this happens a year later.  Surely they'd have had this conversation weeks before?    I suppose it was enjoyable enough.  Ang Lee's direction was . . . interesting, and the comic-book touches didn't wear too much.  Jennifer Connelly is hot (if occaisonally miserable-looking).  Can't complain too much for only three and a half quid.  Later . . .

         Kevin Doesn't . . . know what else to tell you about himself, so he made a list that may or may not be too long about his pointless quirks.   Was visiting Coops and Jen this weekend, and we decided, rather than waste our Sunday, we would go to the  urlLink Natural History Museum .  It's cool -- I love walking round museums like that -- but we were only in there for an afternoon, so we only saw a fraction of the exhibits.  Like everyone says, you need a good couple of days to see everything contained therein.  Luckily admission to these museums in London is free now, so it's quite easy to make a couple of trips to get the job finished (assuming, that is, you have yourself a couple of days in London spare).  And of course, there's always the National Science Museum after that.  And the art galleries :)  I actually had a couple of story ideas as well, as I walked round the life galleries.  Seeing all of the prehistoric animals (fossils, casts and illustrations) has made me think about getting back to work on the fantasy novel I have been planning (you may have seen me refer to it as  Beastmaster  or some such).  Really want to get back into this one, especially seeing as my ideas have been so few and far between recently.  Not only inside, but outside as well.  Out the front of the building there was a huge  urlLink Earth from the Air  exhibition (photographs by Yann Arthus-Bertrand ).  Some amazing photographs there, and lots of inspiration.  Coops, Jen and I spent a good hour or so walking around the displays, the others trying to decide which one they wanted for their living room walls.  In the end they went home empty handed because they couldn't decide between  urlLink Jesus  and a  urlLink glacier .    Kevin Doesn't . . . answer back, doesn't follow you home and set fire to your house, and when deflated can be stored easily in any drawer.   Things go well.  Despite no inspiration for the Water Fairytales challenge at the  urlLink Workshop  (next month, maybe), I've been reviewing again and in a more positive frame of mind.  Cooked for my gf for the first time on Friday.  She's still with me, so I'm counting that as a result ;)  Still reading  urlLink  Prince of Ayodhya  .  This Friday, we are going to see Badly Drawn Boy play at the  urlLink Eden Project .  I've not listened to much of his stuff, but I've been doing my research this past week, and I'm looking forward to it now (not to mention the fact that we actually get to walk round the project beforehand).  Later . . .

         Kevin Doesn't . . . look too pleased with Bearcat.   I've nothing to say.  I've been away.  Well, that's not exacly true.  I've been here (aside from a visit back home this weekend); I just haven't been bothered to type anything.  Wow.  A whole month has gone by and I have written nothing (fiction, blog or otherwise).  I'd forgotten just how much being in a relationship chews up your free time.  Not that I'm complaining, you understand ;)  So what's happened?  I've finished reading  urlLink  The Scar   (review to follow, although, given my recent lull, it may be a while).  I just started reading  urlLink  Prince of Ayodhya  by Ashok K. Banker  -- enjoyable so far, although my knowledge of the original Ramayana is non-existent.  I've finally picked up a copy of Strunk and White's  Elements of Style  and  urlLink James Stevens-Arce 's  urlLink Soulsaver , so they go on the pile of things to read.  And that's about it.  No writing to report, and I don't have time for anecdotes about this weekend.  Maybe later.

         I'm Afraid of . . . Hypnosis but I don't Know Why.   Finished  urlLink  Hybrid  by Shaun Hutson .  This is a story of writer's block, and how it affects one particular writer.  On its own, this isn't enough to fill an entire novel, so interspersed with the action we are treated to the book that Christopher is writing (a book that gets finished despite the writers block).  The book within a book takes up the vast quantity of Hybrid, and the links between what Chirstopher writes and what happens to him in the outside world are tenuous at best (and only then become apparent at the book's conclusion.  I found the ending of this book disappointing.  The explanation for what has been happening seems rushed and is ultimately unsatisfying.  The reader is left with a more than reasonable amount of questions.  I found the book Christopher writes --  Fresh Skins  -- more interesting than what was happening to Christopher.  Admittedly, it seems a little too short, and there's another slew of plot questions, but at least it was interesting.  Odd point -- the protag of this book is the protag of some of Shaun Hutson's other books, I noticed, which makes me wonder how these books tie in with each other.  I've never understood why writers would want to write about writers.  Whilst the mechanics of writing, the intricacies of getting published, etc, are interesting to me, I can't imagine it would be interesting to people who don't write.  Certainly when I talk about it with other people, it always sounds boring to my ears, and I stop if I think I'm losing their interest.  I always wonder why people read this blog, although to be honest it's not been a hundred percent about writing for a while now.  Next up:  urlLink  Soulsaver  by James Stevens-Arce .  Later . . .    I'm Afraid of . . . Mr. Paperclip.   I watched  urlLink  Shallow Hal   last night, and found it funny.  Given that the main point of this movie is Fat People Are Funny, does that make me shallow?

         I'm Afraid of . . . Americans.   'I get bored of talking.'  Well, I returned from the Sticks this morning to find that the computers back at work are up and running . . . sort of.  We still can't use half of the printers, and things appeared to have vanished during the virus removal process, but I can actually get some work done now.  As long as I don't have to spend anymore time colouring in I'll be happy.  The weekend away was good.  We had five of us out for a curry in Plymfff on the Friday night.  The pubs afterwards were a little quiet for our liking; my mates spent the rest of the evening lamenting the 'lack of decent women' down on the Brabican.  Elydian managed to convince us to go down to Hope Cove on the Saturday for the infamous Hope Cove Weekend.  Should have known better -- past experience has taught us HCW is typically boring -- but we went anyway.  Walked around a couple of times, bought a treasure hunt sheet (which we didn't fill in cos we couldn't get any of the clues), and then went home.  What I can remember of Saturday night was better, despite (or because of?) us not getting into Fusion Squared and one of my mates getting into some agro with one of my neighbours.  I don't know which one of us it was, but I have my suspicions.  Later . . .    I'm Afraid of . . . Britney Spears.   So what else is there to report?  Just finished  urlLink  From a Buick 8  by Stephen King .  Despite my fears it wasn't as bad as I had been led to believe.  I was a little worried to begin with, but it got quite good towards the end.  SPOILERS > > >  When, towards the end, Sandy starts telling Ned that he won't get any answers from this story, that the story doesn't have any end, I got  really  worried, thinking that SK might be warning us that  Buick 8  doesn't have an end.  As it turns out the ending was quite good.  I liked the way tied Ned's frustration at the story to the ending of  our  story.   Dreamcatcher .   I also started -- and almost finished --  urlLink  Hybrid  by Shaun Hutson.   More horror.  I'll tell you what I think later in the week.   The Well  got rejected again yesterday.  Damn.  Still, I did get an I 'invite you to submit again at any time' from the editor, which is kind of encouraging.  Might have to try and find somewhere to send it when I get a moment.  No word back on  He Missed the Sea .  Finally  New Chapters -- 1; New Stories -- 0; Words -- 12000; Stories in Circulation -- 1 ( He Missed the Sea ); Rejections -- 5; Acceptances -- 0.

         Kevin Doesn't . . . believe the kid is his, so Sonny agrees to watch over him until a foster family can be found.   I can't write too much today, 'cos work's been hit by those viruses.  Everything's clean (or so they tell us) but the network took a pounding yesterday, and now nothing works.  Email and internet access is sporadic at best, and we can't get to anything saved on the network.  I've spent the morning colouring in drawings with a highlighter, and I look to be spending the afternoon in much the same way.  Had to walk to work this morning because my all of my rides are away.  Didn't mind too much, but it started raining about five minutes into the journey.  Being stubborn as I am, I chose to carry on towards work (still twenty minutes away) rather than go back to the Distant Past and get a coat.  I looked like a drowned rat when I finally got to the office.  I'm going back to the Sticks tonight for a long weekend.  Thought I'd take advantage of the bank holiday and go back and see my friends and family.  We're going for the obligatory curry tomorrow night, and Saturday night will probably be spent on the usual pursuit of beer in Kings.  Still, I'm quite looking forward to it, as I've not been back home this summer as much as I would have liked.  I've done some work on  Eclipse  past couple of nights.  (Yeah!)  No new words down, but I did manage to develop some ideas in terms of the plot and the characters.  I'll take a pen and pad with me this weekend, hopefully I'll have a few moments to work on it further.  One other thing . . . a new  urlLink challenge  approaches, so I've tried to think up an idea for that.  Want to participate in this one, seeing as I haven't posted anything at the  urlLink workshop  in months.  Later . . .

         Kevin Doesn't . . . even seem to be concentrating then all of a sudden he announces "I know where Eve is!"   Finished  urlLink  A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire 2)  by George R.R. Martin , last night.  Good book, but something that has me slightly worried is that this book is a series.  I had resolved not to read anymore series unless they were finished and fully published, after Robert Jordan so effectively destroyed my faith in the epic-fantasy genre.  I was unwilling to get involved in a writer's world in case the books started declining in quality or look as though they were never going to end (crimes of which Jordan is becoming increasingly guilty).   Anyway, I thought that  Song of Ice and Fire  was completed.  It was only when I was browsing around at Amazon that I realised that only half of the series had yet been released.  Nevermind.  The books so far have been brilliant, and I have been amazed at not only the complexity of the world Martin is sharing with us, but also the fact that I haven't gotten bored with it.  So many characters, motives, plot-lines, all deftly woven together, and I still want to read more and more.  I was in town this weekend and it was hard not to just buy the two halves of  A Storm of Swords  so I could read them straight away (harder still considering WHSmith's 2 for 10 offer).  It seems I still have a little faith in the genre.  Next on the list:  urlLink  From a Buick 8  by Stephen King .  I read this book with trepidation; I've heard some really bad things about it.

         Kevin Doesn't . . . Dance.   After fiddling around with it last night, I think I may have finally finished  urlLink  He Missed the Sea   (the flash piece that I've had in development for about a year now).  The only person who's read it so far is me, so I'm tempted to leave it a couple of days whilst I find somewhere to send it, and then read it over again before I hit send on the email.  I don't know, I might do.  This story wasn't workshopped because I don't think it actually qualifies as spec-fic.  I don't really know  what  it is.  I thought I'd avoid the inevitable cries of 'This isn't **insert whatever genre was ticked**!' by not posting it at the  urlLink 'shop .  In other news: I haven't heard anything back from  The Well  recently.  It's approaching the end of the two months quoted as the market's RT, so I may have to send out a polite query next week.

         Kevin Doesn't . . . think you are the next Miss Universe!   Just got back from our long weekend away in Cornwall.  I'm sunburnt and tired and severly poorer, but it was definitely worth it.  The highlight of the weekend was definitely the  urlLink Eden Sessions  gig on the Friday night.  Aiden Smith was okay, some of his humorous songs were quite funny.  Grand Drive started slow, and I found my mind wandering before they finally picked up the pace a little.  The Thrills were good -- Lou thought they were amazing and is already talking about booking tickets to their next tour.  I actually thought that Badly Drawn Boy was better.  Like I said, I've not been listening to his music for long, but I recognised most of the old tracks and thought I could get into the new stuff he's writing.  Saturday we went to the beach, where I burnt in random splotches across my back and legs.  Sunday we went out walking along the cliffs around Fowey.  Thanks to my sunburn I had to do the walk in jeans and a T-shirt.  Not a pleasant experience considering the weather (hot, hot, hot), but it was a nice day all the same.  And I finished reading  urlLink  Prince of Ayodhya  by Ashok K. Banker.  { 7/10 }  Sunday I started on  urlLink  A Clash of Kings (A Song of Ice and Fire 2)  by George R.R. Martin .

         She liked to make me run   The Balderdash (a 4x1 Mile relay race organised by the sports and social club here at work) approaches, and I get invited to run the course to see how bad it is.  My time is about 7'30", which pleases me muchly, given that I only started training about three weeks ago.  I feel more confident about running it on Thursday now.  Later . . .    She liked to eavesdrop    urlLink  A Man Betrayed  by J.V. Jones .  The trouble with the second book in a trilogy is that quite often nothing really happens.  No new plotlines are introduced; we usually see the continuation of existing plotlines, or maybe the combination of them.  Rarely are new major characters introduced or, if so, chances are they will only be around for the middle book, or will play a minor part in the third.  It's hard to like or dislike the second book in the trilogy (or any middle book in a series) -- you find yourself having little opinion until you've finished the trilogy and you can judge it as a whole.  It doesn't stand alone; if you liked the first book, then chances are you'll like the second.  If you didn't, then you probably won't even read the second.  I liked  urlLink  The Baker's Boy  , so I read  A Man Betrayed .  I found it quite good, although things continued to happen that, whilst amusing in the first book, began to get annoying.  Page after page of the Archbishop thinking about food.  Bodger and Grift gossiping and sharing invaluable advice about the ways of women (when it comes to Bodger and Grift actually getting a bigger part, it seems misplaced, part of you thinks that they shouldn't be interacting with the other characters, they should just be talking about them in a 'lady melliandra's sure is pretty' way).  Tawl and Nabber remain my favourite characters, and the way their friendship is developed and the strains that are put upon it are quite nicely written.  Jack and Melli's stories are good, although at times the rivalry between Baralis and Maybor gets boring.  I'll read the final book, as I've enjoyed what I have read so far.  I'm quite interested in seeing just how Jack is going to save Melli ('cos you know he's going to).  Later . . .

         She liked to ride some waves    'Touching you cause you're touching me.'   Our accommodation is a backpackers hostel on the road to Fistral Beach.  Inside the walls are decorated with pages from surfing magazines and the model shoots from FHM.  The shower room has a hole in the door at a height that -- should we want to -- me and a couple of the taller members of our party could watch people showering without too much difficulty.  Our bedroom sleeps six in bunks that look like they were made by a blind carpenter with a serious dislike for backpackers, and they are so precarious that going to bed itself is an extreme sport.  Amazingly I manage to sleep two nights on the top bunk without falling off.  The best thing about the room is the view; we can see all of Fistral Beach if we just stick our heads out of the window.  The worst thing about it is the ledge just underneath, which seems to be an early morning meeting place for the noisiest shitehawks in Newquay.  Down in the lounge the television appears to be stuck on the Extreme Sports channel.  It later becomes clear that every television in Newquay is visited by a similar affliction.  This pretty much sums up Newquay -- if it's not about surfing then you'd be better off going down the coast to another resort.  Every other building is a surf shop, and the remainder is made up of places for the surfers to eat (all proud of their 'All Day Breakfasts!' and the 'Best Pasties in Cornwall') or places for the surfers to stay.  By night the town shifts its attentions from surfing to drinking.  Anyone whoever watched  Newquay Nights  will be aware that there is a surprising number of pubs, bars and clubs in the town, although our party only visits about half a dozen of them.  Even though it's late September the town is busy, and I shudder to think what it's like at the height of the season.  On our first night we end up in a deceptively large night club called Sailor's.  My housemate is convinced we've walked into a gay bar, as the man-woman ratio is about 19.  We begin to refer to it as Hello, Sailor's.  It gets better though; by the end of the night the ratio is down to about 15 and we feel positively swamped in women.  The second night consists of much of the same; killer pool, cocktails, and drunken renditions of  I believe in a Thing Called Love .  We end up in a Walkabout Inn -- travelling 200 miles to end up in a chain pub -- catching the last few songs of a live band who in my drunken state appear pretty good.  I spend my days on the beach.  I resist the temptation to get in the water myself, instead choosing to watch the others, check out the surfer girls walking up and down the beach, and throwing stones at the shitehawks with the two or three others who stayed on the sand.  Later . . .    She liked to defend her home town    'The crowd on a night out in Old Town are chiefly composed of wannabe yuppies, but no actual yuppies, as any young person with a university education has the sense to get far, far away as soon as humanly possible.'   Interesting article ripping into the place I currently reside in  urlLink here .  It is nice to know that someone else thinks it's 'a cultural void'.  Later . . .

         She liked to check   My line manager just approached me, told me that someone in dams was looking for a young engineer to go out onto site and take care of some surveying.   'Where is it?'    Slight hesitation.  Then:  'Eheh . . . Iraq.'   I told them to keep on looking.  I'm after a good bit of site work (the training process demands that I have a bit of it), but the idea of standing in the middle of Iraq wearing a high-visibility jacket just didn't appeal to me.  Not whilst the guys wearing camoflage are getting killed so easily.     She liked to be honest   Speaking to my ex:   'You go out last night?'   'Yeah.'   'Mission?'   'Yeah.'   'Smells like it.'   Yeah, thanks for that.  I'm going to let that remark slide, but only because on seeing that I was late for work, she sent me a text asking if I was alright.  Last night was a mate's birthday.  The mate in question got a little emotional towards the end of the evening, but we can forgive such behaviour on a birthday.  Good night, curry, pub and club, and considering it was a week night I survived remarkably . . . intact.  Now it's just a case of sitting and waiting for four o'clock to roll round.  This weekend some friends and I are going down to Newquay in Cornwall.  Every year some people from work organise a surfing trip down there, and in the spur of the moment last night we decided to go along with them.  I'm not a surfer, so the plan is to turn it into a bit of a drinking weekend.  Later . . .

         I'm Afraid of . . . feeling good.   Went clubbing last night.  Hungover at work.  It's funny, whenever I'm in these situations (and we try and do the thursday night out a couple of times a week) I never feel that bad first thing.  However, as the day wears on and I begin to sober up, I start feeling worse.  I've managed to avoid the headache today -- unlike my housemate, heh -- but I'm dehydrated and I feel like doing anything other than checking reinforcement drawings.  Boring enough at the best of times, but today all of the lines are become one.  The paper looks like someone tried to draw a game of pick-up sticks.  Gah.  Consequently nothing to report for the past few days.  I've worked a bit more on the superhero story, but I know now that I'm not going to make it this month.  Next month the workshop is running a YA Challenge, which doesn't really appeal to me.  Maybe I'll actually work on something else instead.  No word back from either of my stories, but I don't expect anything for a while.  Later . . .

         I'm Afraid of . . . her Reaction.   In case you're wondering about yesterday's cryptic message, I broke up with Louise on Friday night.  It was inevitable, I guess.  I'm okay with it, she's okay with it, and we seem to be on good terms still, so I can't complain.  I'm not overjoyed at being back on Single's Row; the last time I was there I got locked in.  Later . . .    I'm Afraid of . . . Fat Naked Men.   So what else?  We're now in the Swing Area.  Feels like we've taken over a university computer lab.  I keep turning around expecting to find a lecturer looking over my shoulder, checking that I'm working and not surfing the web or something.  Only six weeks to go.  Finished reading  The Hobbit .  Good yarn.  Not as good as  TLotR , but close.  Not overly keen on the way Tolkein keeps writing stuff like 'as I'm sure you remember' or 'of course, you and I know differently'.  It always pulls me out of the story a little, like it's constantly reminding me this is something that someone made up.  Can't remember if it was this bad in  TLotR .  Later . . .

         I'm Afraid of . . . heights but adore flying craft.   Don't really have anything to say today, but it's the end of week and . . . well, you know.  A hectic/quiet day at work today.  Hectic in the fact that approximately sixty-five of us are moving offices this weekend to make way for a refurbishment.  Quiet in the fact that I don't have a lot of work to do, and I've already finished my quite minimal packing.  Hence having the time to write a journal entry with no real content or purpose.  Every-so-often I get asked to assist in some lifting or moving -- because I'm young, I must be strong and willing to lift and push -- but mostly I'm just waiting for the madness to begin at four o'clock.  Elydian has relaunched his  urlLink blog , this time with one of blogger's designs as opposed to his boring old design.  It's still pointless.  I've got a bit more word count to report, but I wasn't quite as productive last night as I would have liked.  Still reading  The Hobbit .  Still writing my superhero story (gonna miss the challenge? yep).  Started running again.  Seem to have the time now -- more time than I know what to do with -- and I actually have something to train for.  Hopefully, by the time this event has passed, I'll be motivated enough to carry on running.  New Chapters -- 1; Words -- 14200; Stories in Circulation -- 2 ( The Well ,  He Missed the Sea ); Rejections -- 6.  Later . . .

         I'm Afraid of . . . it and I Wrote it.   Finished  urlLink  Talon of the Silver Hawk  by Raymond E. Fiest  over the weekend.  Not a bad story, as it stands, and managing to avoid the 'Pug and Nakor debate the nature of evil' that soured the last book of the Serpentwar Saga for me.  It was nice to see a change of setting however; the eastern kingdoms seemed fairly well thought out.  Talon's a good enough protagonist, although that 'master of everything I try' thing always seems a little hard to believe.  Next up:  urlLink  The Hobbit  .  Hard to believe, especially given what a fan of  The Lord of the Rings  I am, that I've never read this book before, but there you go.  Later . .

Ideally I'd let it sit a week until I reread it, but I'll see how impatient I get.  If I can get someone to read the new version for me, all the better.

         I'm Afraid of . . . Non-Americans.   Made the required changes to  He Missed the Sea  last night, but I'm not quite ready to send it back to the market.  I want to sit on it for a day or two, so I can have a read through with a little distance.  I don't want to send it out full of new mistakes, and I don't particularly want to send out if the new bit doesn't match the tone and voice of the rest of it.  On the subject of submissions, following the latest rejection of  The Well  I've spent some time at Ralan's looking for another place to send it.  I've decided this time that I'm going to remove the italicized biographical sections, see if it fares any better.  The dislike for these sections has been fairly consistent.  I might try and send that out tonight, but I'm not too worried if it goes out tomorrow.  Later . . .     I'm Afraid of . . . Mandated "Educational" Television.    I saw your blog today - nice - yeah, don't be discouraged by that, I've sent stuff and never gotten a response - good luck with it. Sincerely, A Complete Stranger   Um.  Thanks?

Sent a rather sycophantic email to Jim telling him how much I enjoyed, so I won't bother repeating any of that here :)  Seriously though, I would definitely recommend this one.  It's funny, it's thoughtful, it's well-written.  Going to watch  urlLink  American Pie: the Wedding   tonight.  Think I might leave my brain at home.  To go expecting too much would probably be silly.  No new words on my Superhero challenge entry, but still got plenty of ideas for where I can take what I've written so far.

It was for this month's Superhero challenge at the workshop.  All last week I was unable to think of an idea for a story, when all of a sudden one comes to me whilst I was in the shower.  Of course, the words are very rough as yet, but they're NEW words.  Here's to hoping I can keep it up.  Later . . .

Now if I was the kind of person that would cheat a challenge that was undertaken solely for personal betterment, I would say that I have already completed six days, and let myself finish six days early.  I'm tempted, but in those last six days I've been drinking coffee like my life depended on it, and I'm supposed to be swearing off caffeine as well.  *sigh*  It's the full month or nothing, I guess.

         He always used to say it was a night off   Night off last night, although I did think a bit more about the novel whilst I watched  Mind of a Millionaire .  Since my resolution to turn November into 'Alcohol Free November' a couple of days ago, I've already had a couple of invites to events which would likely involve alcohol.  Must be strong in my resolve :(  One of them wants me to go Karting (altho, obviously the alcohol would come after), but after  urlLink last year's performance  I'm reluctant.  The other was news that Harmsway is coming back to England, and wants to meet up with everyone.  Later . . .

         He always used to say he was the fool    The Golden Fool  by  urlLink Robin Hobb   Oh my god, Robin Hobb just gets better and better.  I could not put this book down, and even now, three days after finishing it, it's still running round the inside of my head.  I still find myself wondering what will happen in the conclusion of the tawny man series (and the conclusion of the whole Fitz-Fool saga if the dust cover of  Fool's End  is to be believed).  I still find myself marvelling at the complexity of this book; Fitz's relationships with those around him (both the old characters and those that are introduced or given bigger roles) are ever changing, and they all work together perfectly to shape the person that Fitz becomes and how he behaves.  There is a slight disappointment in the fact that not a lot seems to be resolved in the book.  The purpose of the book seems mostly to set up for the action of the third, for the final conclusion, and at this the ending might be seen as unrewarding by some.  Trick is, the book is so well written, so engaging that you don't really mind.  It works well, I personally don't know if I can wait the year or so it's going to take for  Fool's End  to come out in paperback.  The involvement of some threads from  The Liveship Traders  is a surprise.  I was quite impressed to see things that didn't appear to be related being tied together by Hobb in this book.  For that reason, whilst I'm going to wholeheartedly recommend this book, I'm going to suggest that people not only read  Fool's Errand  first, but also  The Farseer  and  The Liveship Traders  series first, as I've a feeling this series is going to bring them all together.

         He always used to say 'Oh fucking hell, I hate going that fucking way'   Grovesy misses his ferry, and arrives in Swin four hours late.  We wait for him in the pub, and five pints later I feel a little drunk.  It's five in the evening and Coops and Student With No Razor have made a game of pool last an hour.  Our taxi driver is an old Jamaican fella, who puts a liberal sprinkling of 'fuck's or 'fucking's into every sentence he speaks.  He asks me which route we should take into town, and when I name one he tells me that he hates 'going that fucking way', and then goes into quite a long rant about how, because it's a narrow country road, you can't tell whether anything's coming your way until it's too late.  He sounds like a petulant child, and I spend most of the journey fighting to hold back laughter.  I almost succeed, until he overhears a conversation between my mates in the back, and adds his own views on the subject of pulling and sex: 'You should fuck what ever you fucking can, whenever you fucking get the chance, because one day you won't be able to fuck anything, and you'll fucking regret it.  It doesn't matter if the water's dirty, it'll still cool the iron.'  By this stage I'm almost crying with laughter.  We have a curry, and go to a few bars in the olde side of townne.  This turns out to be a good choice, the women are better looking, the bars are better, and, whilst it is more expensive up here, the beer is well received.  Student With No Razor drops a bottle, I fuck up a flaming sambuca, and everyone gets angry with the 'Weakest Link' machine.  The clocks go back tonight.  We spend our extra hour listening to Student With No Razor talk, and watching some remarkably sex-free soft focus porn on L!ve TV.  We nervously watch England's rugby world cup match the following morning.  The score is far too close for comfort, and whilst we eventually win, we probably don't deserve to.  The others get trains and coaches and ferries home, and I return to the house and crash in front of the television.    He always used to say 'I watch too much television'.   Remarkably, I actually managed to work on my writing this weekend.  I finished typing up the changes to  Curiosity , rewriting the ending to that particular story for what will hopefully be the last time.  I continued plotting for  Eclipse .  All of the scenes for the first story are now detailed.  And, I've given some thought as to what I will do for  urlLink NaNoWriMo .  I've decided that I will actually take part.  I'm beginning to think that doing this on the same month that I earlier decided I use to detox -- swearing off the alcohol and caffeine for thirty days -- is probably not a good idea.  Neverwell.

         He always used to say 'The sooner we get out of that bloody swing area, the better'   We moved back to our refurbished office this morning.  It's good to be out of the temporary offices, as I was slowly being driven to a murderous rage.  One more week, and you'd have likely been reading in the news about a crazed graduate engineer going on a killing spree armed only with a scale ruler and a yellow highlighter.  The new office smells of paint, but aside from the bright colours it doesn't  look  like a new office.  This is because, in moving back in, we've moved all of those documents and files back that we don't really have storage space for.  It just looks messy at the moment.  Later . . .

Going to finish that little job off and then let it sit for a week before I decide what to do with it.  Worked some more on  Eclipse  whilst I half-watched Guy Pearce struggle with time travel in  urlLink  The Time Machine  .  The nine stories are now loosely plotted, and next I'm going to try and get a more accurate scene-by-scene account of what happens, try and work out where the loose ends are and what doesn't work.  Toyed with the idea of taking part in  urlLink NaNoWriMo  next month.  Late to jump on the bandwagon with this one, I know, but it would be nice if I was able to keep up a word count of 1700 words a day.

         He always used to say it was a bad thing    Firestarter  by Stephen King.  Finished this novel over the weekend, but haven't had a chance to write what I thought about it.  Well, I thought it was good.  One of the more satisfying King novels I've read in recent times (although, I say that reluctantly because it's now less than two weeks until  Dark Tower 5  comes out!).  Nicely plotted, and the book had a nice momentum, never quite suffering from the prolonged directionless backstory that spoilt  From a Buick 8  and  Dreamcatcher .  Andy and Charlie are great characters, and the father-daughter bond between is well-developed, and how that is affected by their flight is also nicely handled.  Rainbird is an effective antagonist, a seemingly emotionless hitman who is deeper, more intelligent and more involved than anyone realises.  All in all, very good.    He always used to say it looked stupid   I haven't shaved in a few days, and my stubble excites much comment in the office.  The graphics monkey hasn't talked to me about anything else since my return.  If I knew it was going to be this much of an event, I would have been lazy long before now.  Work really is that boring at the moment.  I shudder to think what the talk would be like if I did something drastic like get my haircut . . .    He always used to say 'chemistry . . . insurance . . . my bird, yeah . . .'   After months of failed organisation, we've finally got another reunion tour organised.  I am playing host and three of my good friends from back in the sticks -- Coops, Student With No Razor, and Grovesy -- are coming to visit me.  Don't know what we're going to do yet, but it'll be good to see everyone again.  Of course, this means I'm not going to get any work done this weekend.  Later . . .

         She liked to give me money   Written on my little break:  -- 13 1o 2oo3   I'm walking down the hill from my Nan's when I receive a text from my brother, correcting me on a small misquote of a Darkness song on this page.  Now normally you can go long stretches of time without hearing from him.  Texts from him telling you when he's off work (so you can phone him and be sure he's free to talk) or telling you how he's getting on are few and far between, yet misquote a lyric from a song he likes and he can't get to his mobile phone fast enough.   Never mind the fact that what I wrote was actually what we, in our ignorance, were singing :)  -- 13 1o 2oo3   My dad and step-mother have gone on holiday, and I sit at the kitchen table, listening to Queen's  Under Pressure  and drinking tea.  I'm trying to write, but Cookie, one of the manor's two cats, keeps sitting on the paper.  I've told him he's not helping the process, but he's not listening.  -- 14 1o 2oo3   That's got to be the shortest holiday in the history of my family.  My parent's are coming home early, only a day after they left.  So much for peace and quiet.   I've finished revising  Curiosity , so I'll be able to type up those changes when I get back to Swin.  I'm going to see if I can work on something else before my parents get back and start making noise.  -- 16 1o 2oo3   I don't have a computer down here, so I resort to working on  Eclipse , the story I've resolved to write by hand.  Worked out a few details of plot and it looks like it will require nine stories in total.   Oh, and these quarterly reports I mentioned have actually been drafted.  I'm a little scared :)  -- 17 1o 2oo3   Coke, not wishing to be outdone by Cookie, spends quarter of an hour batting the end of my pen as I write.  He is responsive to my polite requests to stop as the other cat was.    She liked to plot    urlLink  Legends of the Riftwar: Murder in LaMut   by Raymond E. Feist and Joel Rosenberg.  I never really got into this book until about fifty pages from the end, and even then I don't think I really connected with any of the protagonists.  The story centres around three mercenaries, long term companions whom I gather have been transplanted from Rosenberg's world into Feist's.  They take a bit of bodyguarding duty after months of garrison duty, and gradually get drawn, much to their displeasure, into the politics of Yabon province (and the greater politics of the Kingdom of the Isles, that you'll probably only be familiar with if you've read Feist's  urlLink  Riftwar Saga  ).  I think one of the problems with this book is that it takes so long for it to really go anywhere.  It's a long time before anytihng happens and you can begin to see where the plot is going.  The three protagonists are reluctant to get involved in the politics of the earldom, and I was much in the same mindset.  If I had wanted to get embroiled in all of that again, I would have reread  Magician .  I'm going to stay away from the other collaborations unless there's nothing else on my list to read.  These additions to the  Riftwar Saga  don't actually seem to add anything.  Later . . .

         She liked to relax   I am going back to the sticks next week for a spot of dog-sitting.  My dad and step-mother are going on holiday and they need someone to look after the animals and the house whilst they're away.  It'll be a quiet week -- Limbo in the winter is pretty much a ghost town, except there is less happening -- but with any luck I'll be able to get some work done.  I have some writing to do, and I really should make a start on my quarterly reports :(  Consequently I'm having a holiday from the internet until the 20th of the month.

         She liked to make me jump   The trailer for  The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen  contains a warning of 'moderate violence and horror'.  What the hell is moderate horror?  People jumping out from behind sofas shouting 'Boo!'?  Raised voices?  Later . . .    She liked to break the rules   In between bouts of sneezing, I scribble the title in big letters in the blank space at the top of the first page.  It looks quite good and I remind myself that I am supposed to be writing, not drawing, tonight.  My housemates spot it -- I'm pretty sure they've not otherwise looked at the murdered manuscript I've left lying around the lounge this past week -- and the word  Curiosity  becomes the joke of the evening, the answer to any question posed.  I try to ignore them and get on with the revision.  The revision is nearly complete, and I hope that I can get it finished -- and the changes typed up -- before the end of the week.  It's time I either let somebody review this story, or just send it out.  It's been too long in the making.  Later . . .

         She liked to keep dragons    urlLink  Guards! Guards!  by Terry Pratchett .  Terry Pratchett is always safe.  I've long been a fan, and I don't think there's anything of his that I haven't liked.  Sure, there have been the occassional books that I haven't enjoyed as much as the others, but I've still liked them.  Even in those books there has been enough to draw me back for a second reading.   Guards! Guards!  isn't my favourite of the Watch books -- and I've read them all apart from  urlLink  Night Watch   -- as it seems to lack the complexity of the later ones.  That said, it is very funny and still a pretty good book.  It was nice, having already met the watch's core characters, to see how they met (how, for instance, Sam and Sybil get it on).  As I've said, the plot itself is relatively simple; without spoiling too much, a dragon is terrorizing the city and the watch, which has become rather redundant, has to work out what's going on.  It's simpler than the later Watch books, but it's also funnier, and a good start to the series.  Later . . .

         She liked to eat cake   I'm 24.  Doesn't feel any different to 23.  Can't say as I was expecting it to.  One noticeable difference; I start to recieve birthday cards that joke about being old.  This is a worrying development.  A card this morning (from my Dad, of all people) reads:  'Happy birthday, to a very young person . . . in a very old body'.  Hilarious.  I've never liked those cards -- 'Hehe, you're over the hill' -- but I like them even less now I'm starting to get them.  'Don't worry, you're still young at heart!'  Yes, that's because I'm still young!  But, it is a good day, despite being in work.  Later . . .

She liked to look at the old man   I stand in the queue at Virgin, waiting to purchase my copy of  urlLink  Thirteenth Step  .  Twelve George Clooneys smile at me from the back of his 2004 calender.  I'm a little scared.  I feel sorry for the woman (or guy, I suppose) who has to spend a month with Tired George, let alone a month with Old Man George staring at them from the wall.  The Hollyoaks calender is too far away for jokes.    She liked to lie   Tweaked  Curiosity  a bit this weekend, although the rewrite isn't quite complete yet.  Also tried out a new  urlLink plotting aid  over the weekend, typing out a few scenes from  Dearest . . .  and generally just playing around.  Not sure quite what I think of it yet, but it seems to be okay.  Certainly beats doing in Powerpoint (which was okay, but the file sizes became just too large).  Later . . .

         She liked to collect curiosities   Pulled out  Curiosity  for the first time in a long time last night.  Don't know why I never finished working on it, but there it was, halfway through a revision.  I read through it, and rewrote the ending.  Tonight, with luck I'll have a look at the smaller points that were raised -- showing and not telling with 'the rules', removing unneccesary action, purging the passive voice.  I also want to download some stuff from the workshop ready to start reviewing again.  Update:   New Chapters -- 1;   Words -- 14400;   Stories in Circulation -- 2 ( The Well ,  He Missed the Sea );   Rejections -- 6.  Later . . .    She liked to cheer me on   It's raining -- a light drizzle that eventually stops before the start of the race -- and the fifty or more of us huddle under the trees near to the start line.  The air is cold and wet and the guy next to me complains of a sore throat.  'He said he'd call it off it rained,' says G-2.  'I'd like to hear his definition of rain.'  He stalks off, complaining about the weather.  They don't call it off, and five minutes later we walk over to stand by the start line.  I'm running the last lap, so I get to stand with all of the spectators, in their coats and umbrellas and 'told you so' grins, and wait for my turn.  The grass is slippery and I start too fast.  I feel like I'm walking, as I'm getting overtaken every other step.  The girls from my office alternate between calling me traitor (I run for the Coastal department) and cheering me on.  When I get my breath back I find the woman with our clipboard, and I am over the fucking moon.  6'47"  It's not a great time in the scheme of things (one of the guys who overtook me got 5'15") but I'm more than pleased.  I've only been running a month, I shaved about forty seconds off my PB, and (whisper it) I beat my ex and G-2.  Later . . .

Half an hour phone call with my brother last night, because he felt a strong urge to tell me what he's brought  everybody  for Christmas.

Also spent a long time last night convincing my computer to save my 51 kiloword text file.  It did not want to do it.  I eventually convinced it of the best course of action, but it took me over half an hour.  Bloody antiquated machine.    I'm the guy who thinks it could be a laugh   Elydian sent me  urlLink this link  earlier in the week, basically it's for something London Book Fair are organising called Lit Idol.  One thing though, is that I doubt that what I'm writing at the moment would count as 'the next big quality commercial bestseller'.  I'm not entirely sure I would want it to, but it's worth some thought.  Later . . .

         I'm the guy who won!   NaNoWriMo, day 26:  1741 words on Thursday night   0 words on Friday night   2944 words on Saturday   0 words on Sunday   1790 words on Monday night   2050 words last night  Woohoo!  Last night I won NaNoWriMo!  I passed the 50 kiloword mark last night, and tomorrow I'll bring it in and get it verified (hoping that by then I'll have gone far enough above 50000 to allow for differences in the counting methods).  Last night a made a start on Part 2 of the book; the protag has gone back home, currently unaware that the evil has followed him up there.  I'm still worried that at 50000 words I've only got through a third of my loose plot, but it  should  be alright.  A lot of the final count will be cut away and tidied up in the rewrites.  The worry is nothing though, I just can't believe that I've done it.  I can't believe it's over.    I'm the guy who couldn't celebrate   Alcohol free november, day 26:  So, England won the rugby world cup on Saturday.  Was very happy about this -- fucking ecstatic actually -- but disappointed, because I couldn't celebrate the win in the only way how; by going out and getting smashed.  The temptation to go out and have a drink was almost overwhelming, but I resisted, and it eventually went away.  (could have been so easy, he thinks, no one would know if I didn't tell them...)  But no, I resisted.  Had to turn down an offer to go out with Coops in London as well.  Couldn't make it in time for the match because of my plans on Friday night, and joining them for a day on the lash wouldn't have been all that fun for me being sober.  Neverwell.  When I spoke to Coops on Saturday lunchtime he was already drunk.  Two days of training course on Monday and Tuesday.  Also testing my resolve.  How much did I want a coffee yesterday?    I'm the guy who is going to London anyway   Harmsway and Maffew are back in England this weekend, so I'm going, with another guy from back in Nottingham, up to London to meet them.  Should be quite a good weekend -- always nice to meet the guys, especially now that we're spread out in different countries -- but I'm a little upset that it's been organised in my sober month.  Another night of lemonade and water looms.    I'm the guy who came to the Calla   So I finished  Wolves of the Calla .  Don't want to say too much about this one (I got bored of doing the book reviews thing), but this book is great.   Go buy it and read it now (or if you haven't read the first four, go and buy them, read them first).  Only one thing . . .  Song of Susannah  is slated for a summer 2004 release.  I'm thinking that'll be at least six months following  Wolves... .  Six months!  That means I've got to wait until May at least.  Later . . .

The characters have left the funeral and are now on their way to the interment.  There was a lot of pushing and shouting and crying last night.  All is not well in this little village.    I'm the guy who is lost on his own computer   Unbelievable.  In a fit of . . . something (I wanted to call it generosity, but that isn't quite right), IT are updating  all  of the computers at work (OS gets bumped up to WinXP, Office gets bumped up to 2003).  Of course, my computer here can't handle the new stuff, but there you go.  Now I've just got to spend the next couple of weeks familiarising myself with XP, and then I can get back to work.

         I'm the guy who had a good weekend   NaNoWriMo, Day 18:  998 words on Friday night (I had an easy night because it was the last in the series of  Scrubs )   4690 words on Saturday.   1919 words on Sunday (not so great because of the England Rugby -- woohoo! -- and Football -- boohoo! -- internationals).   2117 words last night.  Yay, I broke the 37 kiloword mark last night.  Of course, this means I've now got to the hardest part of what I have (basically) plotted for this novel: the funeral.  The characters have got to the church, and when I left it yesterday, I was wasting word count by describing everyone reacting to the various hmyns and how they're mourning.  Not looking forward to this.  Update:   New Chapters -- 1;   Words -- no idea (although NaNo's up to 37323);   Stories in Circulation -- 1 ( The Well );   Rejections -- 6;   Acceptances -- 1 ( He Missed the Sea  -- now live at  urlLink Flash Me Magazine ).    I'm the guy who had a bad weekend   Alcohol Free November, Day 18:  Well, I did it.  Saturday night I went out on the town, stayed out until one o'clock, and didn't drink.  At all.  I passed the test.  Spent the whole night on lemonade and water, and actually managed to have a reasonably good time.  Saturday night was the birthday of a friend from work.  Unfortunately, I was the only person out representing work, but I had a good night nonetheless.  Fluffy's mates got him wasted (and I say it like that because I, in sober mode, took no part in it).  I have never seen him that drunk before.  By ten o'clock, walking to the pub in the evening, the poor boy was falling all over the place.  We managed to get him into the club, but he disappeared on us about midnight, and we assumed that he had staggered off home.  I found out yesterday that he passed out in the gents, and had to be rescued/evicted by the bouncers after the club closed.  A worrying development, when I go out and stay sober: I seem to get a little sympathy drunk.  I was actually wobbling a bit myself in the club, and I got a seriously bad case of beer goggles.  Up until now, I wasn't aware that you could get drunk by association.    I'm the guy who lives in the reptile house   So I finish my NaNoWriMo effort, after two hours of writing, and I go downstairs thinking I'll get myself some supper and watch a little television before bed.  It's ten o'clock.  Downstairs all the lights have gone off and my housemate has already curled up in his basket and gone to sleep.  It's ten o'clock!  Milkmen keep later hours than this.  I am forced to negotiate the ground floor in the dark, because the light switch is way across the room.  I'm beginning to think that Gilly is cold-blooded.  Ever since the onset of winter, he's been going to bed earlier and earlier.  He's practically hibernating.  He's also complains of the cold non-stop, mostly when it's not really that cold in the house.  I feel like I should be keeping him in a warm glass tank and feeding him insects and dead mice.

         I'm the guy who is ahead of schedule   NaNoWriMo, Day 13:  2451 words last night.  The awkward, rubbish, crappy scene is finished.  It actually got a little better towards the end, mainly I think because I was killing the character who was pissing me off so much :)  It got better when the big bad turned up and started picking off her children.  The words came a bit nicer, and there were even a couple of nice turns of phrase in there.  Nothing quite as good as the big bad's first appearance yet, but it'll buff up at the rewrite.  So I've started another scene.  It's back to the protag this time, so here's the call for lots of meandering description and watching how people react to his being where he is.  More fun.    I'm the guy who is a theobromine junkie   Alcohol Free November, Day 13:   urlLink Elydian  yesterday asked me if chocolate contains caffeine.  I think he was trying to catch me out cheating.  Bastard.  Any way, it turns out it does, but that it's not very much.  I'm not going to count it :)  As far as I see it the occasional chocolate bar is not as bad as my six cups of strong coffee a day habit.  The main thing in chocolate is, apparently, is  urlLink Theobromine , which is like caffeine's little brother.  I'm a bit of a google nerd today.  Later . . .

         I'm the guy who is writing a horror novel   NaNoWriMo, Day 12:  Reached the 20 kiloword mark on Monday night.  Last night I took the count to 22924 words.  I'm happy with what I've written so far.  Not ecstatic, but generally pleased that such high output hasn't turned me into a talentless fool just yet.  I know that I'm going to lose approximately half of the words when it comes to a rewrite.  I accept this, but . . .  But, last night, the last of what I wrote was just complete crap.  The chapter just  doesn't make sense .  It's ludicrous, and I'm writing it thinking,  What is she doing?  Why are they there?   It took a lot of effort to silence my internal editor last night.  I could have quite easily gone back and rewritten the relevant couple of pages, but that would have involved taking some time to think of ways to make it better.  Time I can't really afford to be spending on plotting right now.  So the plan tonight is to soldier on with what I've got, and worry about it in December.  Luckily it's not a main character that's having these plot problems (luckily she won't even be alive come the end of the chapter).  Later . . .

         He always used to say he had a new monkey   Alcohol Free November, Day 12:  I'm not missing coffee, tea or coke at all at the moment.  I have a theory about that, though.  I seem to have supplemented my caffeine intake with sugar.  The trip to the chocomac outside our office has become daily ritual, and since starting work on  Home  I've been keeping what I call motivational sweets by my computer.  Thus far they haven't lasted very long.  It hasn't got to the stage where I'm putting sugar on my cornflakes yet, but it can't be far off.  This isn't good.

Bought myself a shiny hardback copy -- with pictures and everything! -- when I went into town this weekend.  So far, so good.  Any hopes I had of winning NaNoWriMo have just died a horrible death.  That said, after nine days (and I don't count today until I can actually get home tonight and work on it) my word count is up to about seventeen thousand words.

'I'm an engineer, damnit').  I began to discover just how dependent I have become on caffiene.  I couldn't keep my eyes open on the minibus (up or down), and I was actually craving coffee as we walked around the docks.  It was quite a struggle not to order a Coke when we stopped for lunch; it seems I'm doing this automatically these days.  Not missing alcohol at all yet, but then I've still not been anywhere.    He always used to say 'What bit did you build, Kev?'   NaNoWriMo, Day 6:  Consequently we didn't get back until late last night.  I was shattered, so I made no attempt to write, instead choosing to read  Neverwhere  until it was a reasonable going-to-bed hour.  That said, though, I've been quite productive on the first four days of the month, and my word-count is now up to 9875 words.  That's ahead of schedule (not to mention amazing) so I'm quite happy.

I'm not an alcoholic, after all.  Caffiene, I'm missing like a limb.  Okay, maybe that's a slight exageration; this morning hasn't actually been that bad.  I  do  really want a coffee, though.    He always used to say he was a novelist   NaNoWriMo, Day 3:  Got off to a good start.  5651 words down over the weekend.  Mostly trite, of course, but there has been some good stuff in there.

         Kevin likes to feel bad   Wrote another review for the workshop last night, and it turned into a bit of a mauling.  I found a fair few faults with the story, so then, after I'd finished writing it, I began to feel bad about tearing into her.  It's never a nice experience, even though people should be able to take criticism if they're going to put their work in a workshop situation.  So, anyway, I post the review this morning.  I read what the other reviewer had to say about it.  They loved it.  They thought pretty much the opposite of the points I made, which makes me wonder, was I wrong?  Was I just being picky when I said that the action was clichd and that I didn't feel for any of the characters?  I don't really know.  The other thing that worries me now is that this poor girl has got two conflicting reviews; one heaping praise and one saying 'Well, actually . . .'.  What's the author going to say when she sees that?  Which one is the author going to believe?  I know, if it were me, I'd probably go for the praise (though I'd like to think that I wouldn't), but that only works out if I'm wrong.  Damn.    Kevin likes to experiment   So far my little experiment has yielded three last-minute cards.  Quality.  Might have to try this again next year, as most of the people who haven't sent cards out yet don't look like they're going to.    Kevin likes to make jokes   Something that I forgot to mention, but I've started keeping another 'blog, this one for the purpose of having somewhere to put my humour and other random thoughts, without having to keep updating  Thoughts of the Misguided .  The new blog's called  urlLink  Only Excellent  .  Go check it out.    Kevin likes to go back to The Sticks   Finally, the Christmas break is back upon us.  On Monday, I'm heading back to the sticks for two weeks or so.  The upshot of this is that I'm going to be offline until Monday, 5 January 2004.  Merry Christmas everyone . . .

         Kevin likes to laugh   Two reviews last night for the workshop.  Gilly and Shameful went out for a few drinks, so I had no distractions in the house.  Amazing how easy it is just to turn the television off and get on with some work when there's no one lying around the lounge.  I really am either weak-willed or just plain lazy.  Also started work on the December Light Challenge story.  I know I'm never going to get it up in time for December (especially since my internet access stops tomorrow), but I'm considering working on it over my Christmas break, seeing if I can get something ready to sub in January.  Also, JamesR has emailed me about resurrecting the Talecrafters group (or at least starting a new one under the old name).  I've told him I might be interested, but it all hinges on how committed I (or the other members, for that matter) can be to the group.  Last time we tried this, it never really got off the ground.  I've also got to think about how this will affect my work on  Home .  I want to get this finished, and hopefully, workshop it with a group of people who will stick with it.  Also, it's horror, and JamesR is a fantasy writer.  Again, what the other members of the group will be remains to be seen.    Kevin likes to go out   Busy Christmas coming up!  Tomorrow we've got our office party, which promises to be interesting (altho' my ex has told me I have to watch her to make sure she doesn't get too drunk).  Saturday I'm off to see the  urlLink Stereophoncs .  Sunday I'm off to see  urlLink Arch Enemy .  Monday I'm back down to Devon, for a film (  urlLink Return of the King  , yay!) and a meal with the Alumni.  Tuesday we've got relatives visiting, and then it's Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and Boxing Day.  I'm quite looking forward to it.  Now, if only I can shake this bloody cold.  Later . . .

         Kevin likes to send cards   Bit of an experiment with my Christmas cards this year.  After sending out to my friends and those that sit on desks around mine (kinda hard to avoid them :), I've decided to send cards to people who I already know have sent out cards (the CAD monkeys spring to mind).  I want to see how the people who didn't send me one react, whether they'll just ignore it or whether I'll get a hastily written card five minutes later, ink still wet.  Christmas is for having fun.

         Kevin likes to celebrate Bristmas    urlLink Bristmas  report:  Bristol's grey when we arrive.  Bristol's grey when the sun's out but today it's cloudy and miserable.  It's drinking weather, but not the good kind.  It's lets-shut-ourselves-in-a-smoky-room-and-watch-the-football drinking weather.  So we do, and have half a dozen warm-up beers before the meal.  We -- Gilly, shameful and myself -- are joined by one of our hosts, Duffy.  In another pub, just across from the flat, a local at an adjacent table interjects herself into, and then hijacks, our conversation (music careers, money, and dating older men).  Duffy tells us this is common in Bristol.  Seems to be a weekend for such talkative strangers, as the night before we had experienced a similar conversation (fishing, working for the RAF, pub loyalty) with an old man back in the Distant Past.  Cuisine of the night is Mexican.  This means sangria and nachos, tortilla wraps and christmas crackers that seem oddly out of place.  Being unadventurous me, I choose steak for my main course.  It is a good choice in the end, and my neighbours are envious of my dinner (especially the guy to my left when he sees the bones and fish-head he has just been served).  One girl refers to me as 'The guy I see on the stairs', which is . . . strange.  I wonder, briefly, whether I'm the kind of person who blends into the background at work.  I've never considered myself as such.  Sure, I'm not particularly charming or good-looking, but tall people stand out in a crowd, and irritating people who think they're funny tend to stick in the memory, right?  I've seen this girl plenty of times in the three or so months she's been here, yet the couple of times I've passed her on the stairs are the ones that stick in her memory.  As I said: strange.  I wonder if this is a good thing.  I suppose it's better to be unmemorable than to be 'guy who stares at my arse in the canteen'.  During the meal I sit next to an Australian girl.  Somehow I completely forget to mention the rugby to her and manage to pass the meal without really taking the piss once.  Surprising, but even more so for the fact that I'm not directly trying to pull her.  Nice girl, and I do have this thing for foreign women, but I get the impression that she doesn't like me that much.  I blame my lack of piss-taking on the beer.  Normally I would have destroyed any notion she might have had about there being any nice men in England by the time the starters had been brought out.  Shameful lives up to his moniker.   urlLink Groove Armada  are at the Bristol Academy, so at about 0030hrs Killer gets the idea to go over there.  I'm not a big fan of this sort of music (or this sort of event), but I have to admit that it's actually quite good.  They get the dancefloor moving, and at that time of night (and a dozen pints down the line) that's all that really matters.  I refuse to call it live music, however.  You can describe it how you like, but at the end of the day it's still just guys playing records.  At one point towards the end of the night, one guy taps me on the shoulder and says 'those girls are fucking great.'  I look up, and sure enough there are now two women behind the decks.  They don't  appear  to be doing anything.  They could be hot, but at this distance and with the smoke in the air it's kind of hard to tell.   Yeah,  I say, trying to sound as if I completely agree with him.  He carries on dancing.  Back at the flat, Gilly insists on watching our host's  urlLink  Bo Selecta   DVD.  I'm not a fan of Bo Selecta -- in fact I think it's fairly fucking moronic, with only the occassional funny line -- but with nowhere else to go I watch it.  I finally get to turn in at 0530hrs (it's winter so it's not quite daylight outside yet), but only four hours later I'm awoken by Shameful and company returning.  Two hours later I'm back on the motorway, and the car journey pushes me dangerously close to ending the weekend by being sick.  I somehow manage to save face.     Kevin likes to watch BBC News 24   Getting back from Bristol, I discover that American forces have  urlLink captured Father Christmas  after an eight month search.  Bastards :)     Kevin likes to test   I've got to stop following the links on  urlLink Tempest 's page . . .        urlLink What Famous Leader Are You?

         Kevin likes to review   Didn't get a lot done last night, although I did start writing a review for the workshop (what will probably be my first one in six months or so).  I hoping to post something in the near future, so I thought it couldn't hurt to get a few reviews under my belt before then.  Tried watching  urlLink  The River   last night.  Bloody hell, it's hard work.  The first fifteen minutes or so are 'Storm set to music', and it never feels in this opening quarter of an hour that the film's ever going to start.  Then Mel Gibson comes on and starts talking, and  oh dear god will something happen already? .  I gave up after half an hour.  I don't need to waste my time that badly.    Kevin likes to party   Going out in Bristol tomorrow night for the first of the Christmas parties, a night which (in my hilarity) I've dubbed Bristmas.  My housemates and I have managed to get ourselves invited on a party that those who commute here from Bristol.  Should be good, although as far as I'm aware we're still homeless.  Never mind, I will trust in Gilly to sort something out.  Later . . .

         Kevin likes to shoot people   Saw  S.W.A.T.  last night.  Fairly good, dependable if somewhat formulaic.  Farrell and L Jackson play the roles without any real struggle, but manage to give solid performances all the same.  There are explosions and witty dialogue aplenty to please most action film fans.  The problem with this film is that it feels as though someone's trying to establish a franchise.  The first half of the film is given up pretty much entirely to the formation of the team, which, if it were to be considered properly as a single entity, is too much.  A lot of the screen time -- which could be given to more going up against the bad guys -- is wasted on introducing us to the main characters, and how they get into the team, when all we want to see them do is shoot people.  Like I say, it's not a bad film, it's not a particularly good one.  I have a feeling that it's going fall into the 'faceless cop movie' section of my memory; I'll be able to remember certain scenes, but I'll be damned if I'll be able to remember what film they came from.  Later . . .

         Kevin likes to stand in the road   Out looking at manholes again yesterday.  The old adage -- 'once you've looked down one manhole, you've looked down them all' -- is true.  Bored and freezing cold; it isn't a great day.  Saturday night is good.  Shameful and I meet up with one of the girls from work and her gym buddies.  Aside from a couple of incidents involving coats --   (Firstly: I rudely object to having my coat thrown on the floor, by a complete stranger,   (Secondly: I slightly lose my temper when I can't find my ticket for the cloak room, ever-so-slightly scaring the woman behind the counter.  Shameful begins to talk about Red Kev going out and scaring women.  I tell him to shut up.)    -- it is a pretty good night.  Lots of money is spent (December is shaping up to be expensive, but then it always is), lots of beer is drunk, and I don't offend anyone I care about.     Kevin likes to be in the light   Tried coming up with an idea for December's Light Challenge at the zoo.  As has been the case in recent months, I failed to come up with anything that I could reasonably turn into a story by the end of the month.  I have an idea, but it's missing something.  Whether it'll get written now remains to be seen.  Meanwhile, the plan is to soldier on with  Home .  Later . . .

         Kevin likes to carry on working   1264 words last night.  Decided to get back into the habit of working on  Home  every night, after taking a week off following my  urlLink success at NaNoWriMo .  Whilst there's no longer the urgency of last month, I'd like to be able to write a couple of pages every night.  The plan is, if you remember, to get the first draft finished by the end of January.  So my protag, fearing what might happen to him, but following his love interest's advice all the same, has turned himself into the police.  So far that's all I've got.  The interogation is yet to start, but the dialogue between him and another police officer is turning out well.  I don't know how it happened, but I seem to have introduced a nice police character; it's almost as if I'm trying to make the other one (when he deems to turn up) seem even more like he neither believes nor cares about the protag's story.  I don't know how well that will work out in the end, seems a bit cliched, although it was inadvertantly so.  This weekend?  More work on  Home ; I want to reread the  urlLink new ending  of  Curiosity  that I rewrote about a month ago; tomorrow morning's going to be given to finishing my Christmas shopping, and getting a haircut; and tomorrow night I'm going out with a couple of girls from work.  Should be fairly busy, which is nice for a change.  Later . . .

         Kevin likes to gig alone   So,  urlLink tickets  are booked for Arch Enemy at the end of the month.  Not bad.  Because I'm having to travel by coach out of Victoria, it's working out cheaper for me as well.   urlLink Elydian  doesn't want to go to see DT, so I looked at prices for London, Baby.  27 is the cheapest I've seen so far, and that's before I book transport.  Have to think how badly I want to go see them (and of course remember it would have cost twice this if I'd had to travel to Manchester to see them).    Kevin likes to write his novel   NaNoWriMo, verdict:  All in all, I'm rather pleased, both with my effort during NaNoWriMo, and at the output.  Before I started I didn't really know whether I could do it or not, and I'm glad that it proved relatively easy.  I'm sure that if I'd had a more developed plot done before hand then I could have written a lot more than 51007 words.  As it was a lot of time was spent thinking what I wanted to happen one or two scenes down the line and try and make sure that everyone was where they should be when it happened.  As far as output goes, it's fifty thousand words and it's not terrible.  Sure, it's not the best stuff I've written, but I reckon that once it's finished and it's been put through the workshop and it's been revised a couple of times, I might actually have something that I can be proud of.  Of course that's all in the future.  So, what next?  Well,  urlLink National Novel Editing Month  is in March, so if I can get the first draft finished by then I might give that a crack.  Ideally I want to have the thing finished by the end of January (one third took me a month, so I  should  be able to get it finished in three).  I've also got to revise  Curiosity ,  Thanks for Listening  and  Tymmy  which have all been languishing since the last time I rewrote them.  I should also really think about writing some new stuff, and I really want to get infinitewhite.net back online.  So, plenty to be doing.    Kevin likes to have a drink of an evening   Alcohol Free November, verdict:  It was easier than I thought, but I'm glad I can just have a pint, or a coffee, or a Coke, again should I want to.  Not to soon, either.  Shameful's moving back into the house at the end of the week, and we always seem to have beer in the house when he's there.  Bring on Alcohol Fuelled December.

         I'm the guy who sought asylum   Harmsway tells me that the hotel we're booked into is flooded, so me and Maffew proceed rain to our new one.  The new one sounds grand -- The Wellington -- and outside first impressions seem to support this.  It looks far too nice for us, and we wonder just what Harmsway has booked us into.  Our worries are swept aside when we go in, however, and replaced with a whole new set of worries.  The place is a dump.  Maffew refers to it as an 'Asylum Seeker Hostel'.  The receptionist doesn't seem to speak any English (this doesn't really surprise me, as we're in London).  There are people sleeping in the lounge, curled up on the chairs like they're waiting for a coach late at night and the waiting room's heating has been turned off, there are broken panes in the stairwell windows, there is a radiator in the room that won't turn off.  Only one of the toilet doors actually has a lock on it.  It reminds me of my days in Halls of Residence at Uni, only instead of students prowling the corridors it's an army of foreigners, Maffew's asylum seekers.  We only pay 25 each a night, so we don't complain too loudly.  All we really need is a place to crash at the end of the evening.  Harmsway, his girfriend and her friends are already out.  We meet them in an Italian restaurant in China Town.  Again, this place looks too posh for our type of people, so we walk down to the Golden Lion on the corner and have a pub lunch and watch the football.  Harmsway's girlfriend and her two friends are all French.  Maffew speaks French.  Harmsway and I are left standing around in bemusement whilst the other four talk away on the other side of the language barrier.  It improves slightly when Dave arrives; now there are three of us looking confused.  For myself, I can almost understand Maffew, as his speech is slower than the others.  It doesn't help that I've not spoken the language in eight years and, despite my French teacher's insistence, the fact is that I don't believe I have ability at the language.  Harmsway's later revelation that I was to be set up with his girlfriend's mate (this after the girl has already left us) is a surprise.  Harmsway is apologetic about it (really apologetic about it) and I tell him not to worry.  I hadn't found the girl that attractive (and I'm sure that remark will come back to bite me in the arse), and . . .  . . . and it's just that French people  don't get me .  Some of it might just be the way I brutalise the Queen's English when I speak it, or the fact that my westcountry accent is a little thick, but the most popular expression on the faces of French people when I speak to them is that of utter and total confusion.  My normal response to people I don't know is to crack jokes, to try and break the ice with humour, but the French just do not get my sense of humour.  I was using some good material on Saturday (well good for me), but this girl spent the hour or so looking at me as though I was speaking backwards or something.  The idea of being 'set up' with someone I can't even raise a smile in bewilders the hell out of me.  So anyway, we go for dinner at TGIF.  Our waitress is a middle-aged woman under the mistaken impression that pig-tails make you look younger.  She has that annoying TGIF attitude, taking your order and delivering your food in a manner that soon makes you think you're watching children's television.  Maffew asks for the bill after our starter, and she brings us -- wait for it -- an empty chit.  Hil arious .  Now go and get us some more beer.  Tradition holds that we smoke cigars when we meet up, and sure enough Harmsway breaks them out in the last pub of the evening.  We're still smoking them at chucking out time, and a tiny old homeless guy approaches us looking for a light.  We spend the next ten minutes being riddled by this guy.  Harmsway finally stumps the guy with a riddle he pinches from  The Hobbit  (I kid you not), and the homeless guy staggers off, looking for someone to buy him a can of beer.  Next morning, following a 'continental breakfast' (that's hotel speak for 'you're not paying enough for fried food') I decide to risk taking a shower.  Only one of the showers has a shower head (the water dribbles despondently out of the other one), only one of the shower cubicles has a door.  I choose the one with the shower head.  If anyone really wants to see my naked arse whilst I'm showering, who am I to stop them?

         I'm the guy who likes Welsh Rock, death metal, and prog   In about three weeks time I'm going, with my ex, to see the  urlLink Stereophonics  play Cardiff.  It was thinking about this gig, and flicking through the pages of Metal Hammer, that I got to thinking that I don't get out to see live music often enough.  So I've made a resolution.  I discovered yesterday that my latest favourite band --  urlLink Arch Enemy  -- are playing some shows at the end of the month.  I'm going to go, on my own if need be, over to London to catch them.  I've done some research and it looks like I can get a coach back to Swin after the gig.  Excellent.  Also, remembering that  urlLink Dream Theater  are coming to these shores next month, I've decided I'm going to make an effort to see them (for the fourth time).  Just waiting to see if that'll be in Manc (by going up and visiting  urlLink Elydian ), or over in London (on me own again).  Either way I'm going.  Later . . .  (Additional note: Have only just realised (whilst browsing AE's website) that Angela Gossow is quite fit, even if she is  urlLink see through )

It's a beautiful day out, and it really makes me appreciate the grounds our office is in.  We're surrounded by fields and woodlands here, and everything, for the time being, is blanketed in white.

         The first thing I saw was the end   And the December challenge piece is finished.  And it has a name:  Christina .  I didn't have much love for the story by about Friday last week -- it didn't look like I was ever going to finish, and I was getting some serious 'This is my worst work ever' vibes -- but over the weekend I blitzed it, and I have to say that I'm fairly happy with the last couple of scenes.  The ending came together, and whilst the stuff before it may need some rewriting, I think I might be able to make something decent out of it.  No word count yet, as I'm still typing it out, but it's looking to be about five thousand words.    The first thing I saw was an L plate   My driving theory test is booked for Friday, 13 February.  Writing's going to take a bit of a back burner over the next couple of weeks, as I reread my highway code and try to memorise stopping distances.  With luck I can have my practical test taken and failed by the end of April.  Later . . .

         The first thing I saw was the hearse   Well, I'm back.  The funeral went pretty much without a hitch on Monday.  There was a slight problem with the fact that they forgot to put any hymn books on the pews where the immediate family sit, but that was about it.  It stayed dry for us when we went to the cemetery and quite a large proportion came back to the 'Club for the wake.  I think that, all told, we managed to give him a good Irish send off.  I'm a little better.  Last week I was a bit of a wreck.  Just got to keep telling myself that it was a release for him in the end, and not to dwell on it too much.  The important thing now is helping my Nan through the coming months.    The first thing I saw was the number 31   The light challenge peice is inching towards completion.  I worked on it a bit more whilst I was back home (although once more the personal space to do such a thing was a bit of an issue, as I was sleeping on the landing again).  February's challenge is music or something.  No ideas yet.  I've revised  December the 31st .  I'm going to post it to the workshop (and possibly the Talecrafters) in a couple of days.

         The first thing I saw was the knife   The light challenge story continues its steady pace.  I'm surprising myself with this story, normally when it takes this long to write a challenge piece (and I should be getting ready to start February's by this stage), I give up and the story is resigned to the unfinished 'others' folder on my computer.  Not this time though.  Strange.  Maybe it's because I'm writing it by hand.  I typed up  December the 31st , and surprisingly it only came to 859 words.  Looking at the first draft I had thought it was more than that.  I'm going to sit on it for a few days before I revise it, and hopefully sub it to the 'shop.

         The first thing I saw was lines on blank paper   I go upstairs when my housemates start watching the fishing on Home and Leisure.  Try and work on the December challenge piece.  Look at a blank page for a while.  Read over what I last wrote (over a week ago now).  Look at a blank page for a while longer.  Write a couple of paragraphs; they suck and I'm tempted to just put a line right through them.  I give up and pick up the book I'm reading.  Nothing's coming tonight.  And the Talecrafters have begun to make themselves known.  We're not due to start posting and reviewing until the first of the next month, but it looks like James has everything pretty sorted.  Don't know what I'm going to post though, what with this writing block and all.  Maybe  December the 31st  can get it's first public airing at this group instead of the workshop.

         The first thing I saw was a broken heart   Notes from my Christmas break:  --29 12 2003   I get the idea that  getting drunk with my ex  is not such a good idea.  It has taken me a while but the resurgence of the old arguments should be proof enough, should have been proof enough a long time ago.  Sober we're fine.  Sober we're still close.  Drunk I'm an arsehole, and she's careless.   Red Kev stays away tonight, but Mean and Sarcastic Kev meets me at the end of the night.  Mostly it's a good day, but this cripples it.  --29 12 2003    Ocean Colour Scene  stick to an old set list and it serves them well.   Feeder  rock, but their set is far too short.   Stereophonics  also rock and my ex, who it transpires is one step away from being Kelly Jones' stalker, assures me that they are the best she's ever seen.   During Ocean Colour Scene I learn that Welsh people can't dance.  It's like someone got together 50000 Dads and Nans for the world's biggest wedding reception.   I also learn that the Welsh wear their national flag as clothing too much.  Hundreds of them all wearing the dragon as a cape or a skirt.   There is one snafu towards the end, when we get lost trying to find the place the park and ride buses pick up.  Some genius at the Millenium Stadium decided to have the park and ride pick people up fifteen minutes walk from the stadium.  Red Kev makes a brief appearance, then disappears when his ex gets distressed.  We do eventually make it home, cursing the lack of signs in Cardiff.   The Mean Fiddler in London is made entirely from chipboard.  It looks like a youth club in black.    Akercocke  are good, but again they're on for far too short a time.   Arch Enemy  kick, and even though I'm alone, I mosh my little heart out.  --29 12 2003    Return of the King  kicks.  I love this film.  I love this trilogy.  --29 12 2003   Christmas Eve never really gets off the ground.  Elydian is sober, whilst Student With No Razor and I are drunk.  Big Ron stays with his other buddies.  Coops has family stuff.  I remember telling various people that we must get in touch, but not who.  --29 12 2003   Christmas Day: Fried breakfast, guests, visitors, presents, beer, dinner, walk, dessert, telly, game, supper, telly, bed.  --29 12 2003   Salcs lose the rugby on Boxing Day.  Damn.  --29 12 2003   I've been back a week and I finally found some time (and some privacy) to get some writing done.  It's going to be the  December challenge  piece or, if I can't get that started, some more plotting for  Eclipse   --31 12 2003, New Year's Eve   Actually spent some time writing over the last couple of days; working on the seriously late December challenge piece.  No word count yet, but it amounts to about two and a half pages of A4.  --31 12 2003   Despite my resolve not to spend NYE in Kings, it looks like that's where I'm going to be when midnight strikes.  I remain confident.  --31 12 2003   Resolutions:   1. Improve my craft, and become a better writer.  Continue to learn and to help others to grow as writers.   2. Get published again.   3. Work hard towards getting chartered.   4. Stop being so damn single.  --02 01 2004   NYE exceeds expectations, despite a return to last year's scene of the crime, Fusion Squared.  Thanks to Coops I develop a taste for Corona (with the little slice of lime they stuff down the neck of the bottle).  Coops and his girlfriend are dressed as Big Ears and Noddy.  The last of my childhood memories has been sullied.   Crying Girl cries every time I speak to her.  I'm assured by Noddy that it's nothing I've said.  Attractive as Crying Girl is, this proves to be quite the turn off.   DJ fucks the countdown up, so as 12 strikes I'm on the steps overlooking the dancefloor.  --02 01 2004   Fully intended working on my December challenge piece, but ended up working on one of the  December  stories,  December the 31st .  I'm quite pleased with the results, although it needs some trimming to make it flash.  Following on from the success of   He Missed the Sea  , I'm going to see if I can convince soemone to publish it before I put it up at infinitewhite.net.

         The first thing I saw was a working water feature   Back in the Distant Past and back in the office.  Don't have much to say and I left my notes from my Christmas break back at the house, so I'll leave it until tomorrow.  Later . . .

         Suddenly he went crazy with the reviews   That was close.  Just finished my Talecrafter reviews for February.  Just as well this month is a day longer this year, isn't it?  Later . . .

         Suddenly he went to get his eyes done   Fuck Donald and Aitchison.  A week and a half ago:  'Hello, Mr Jones?  I'm just calling to let you know that your lenses are ready.'    Excellent.  Do I need to make an appointment?    'No, no.  Just pop in and pick them up sometime.'  This morning:  'You need an appointment.  I can fit you in on the 12th.'  Bastards.

         Suddenly he went to 'arwell   The most striking thing about this place is how quiet is.  Of course, in my last office the open plan seating facilitated a noisy environment.  Here the offices are divided up in one of the refurbished buildings, but half of the offices are empty.  The quiet is something else, and I find myself struggling not to fill the silence, be it through tapping, whistling or humming.  I'm reluctant to say too much about life out here.  Security's high, thanks to the Anti-terrorism act, I guess, and I don't want to chance saying anything that might be seen as recklessly prejudicing the security of a nuclear site or nuclear material.  Suffice it to say that there's police on the gates, passes, fences, and probably a load of other shit that I won't get to see because my clearance isn't high enough.  I'm pulling long days here, and I wonder how much my writing is going to suffer when all I want to do when I arrive home is get tea and go to bed.  It should be worth it though; I get a 10% hike in my wages for working out of a site office, and Finish Early Friday means I get a longer weekend.  The prospects amongst the opposite sex look demoralising thus far.  I've seen one young woman around the site, but that was a brief siting.  There doesn't appear to be any near my offices.    Suddenly he went nowhere   Broke down on the way home from work last night.  Two days I've been doing this commute, and we've already hit that barrier.  So, the journey home took an extra two and a half hours.  The only annoying thing was it was nothing major; a broken windscreen wiper.  The driver was unwilling to drive on the motorway without one, so we sat in the pub until the RAC pitched up, then felt fairly fucking useless when the repair work took him all of two minutes.

         Suddenly he went over the morning's work   It's amazing how slowly time can fly when you have nothing to do.  It's my penultimate day in the office, and my bosses, normally allergic to any one booking time to the unproductive time codes, have no work for me.  I wouldn't mind, but I've exhausted every other option open to me.  I've caught up with my training and continuing professional development items.  I've tidied my desk and packed away the things I'm taking with me tomorrow.  I've even spent an hour trying to think of some funny things to post at Only Excellent.  I didn't want to have to review at work -- people wouldn't approve -- but they've left me no choice :)  Later . . .

         The first thing I saw was a telltale    urlLink  December the 31st   has had five reviews.  The responses are mixed so far.  Jennifer Michaels (who published  urlLink  He Missed the Sea   last year) liked it, but then others have said that it was incomplete and the ending felt a little rushed.  I will keep it up at  urlLink the workshop  for a while longer, but I probably have enough to make some changes now.  Later . . .

         The first thing I saw was this:    Dear MR JONES   Congratulations!  You have passed the category Car driving theory test.  Your certificate confirming the pass accompanies this letter.   It's a small thing, I realise, but I'm happy.  This means that, providing I pass the practical in two years, I won't have to take that bloody test again.    The first thing I saw was a letter to Shameful   St. Valentine's Day sucks.  Later . . .

         The first thing I saw was an excuse not to work   Went out on Fluffy's last minute leaving do last night.  It was an impromptu night, but I think Gilly's old adage is true; the one's you don't plan are often the best.  In the end only myself, Shameful and a couple of others that went out, but it was good for all that it wasn't busy.  It made me think though; when I hold my not-quite-leaving do in a couple of weeks I'm going to have to make an effort to get a few more people out.  I'll be happy if one in particular comes out, but won't be complaining if a few others come along to see me off.  Later . . .

         The first thing I saw was my story   I've posted  December the 31st  to the  urlLink 'shop  and put it up for the Talecrafters to crit.  I'm hoping I can get it to a point where I can send it out, even though it was only done for a bit of fun really.  Later . . .

         The first thing I saw was the night sky   My social fast is over.  My ex and her mate organised a night out on Saturday and I went along.  Not a bad night, although I did make a bit of a fool myself when, encouraged by thoughts of drunken athleticism, tried to jump a set of railings and totally sacked it.  Ended up on my arse in the mud, with D-2 (luckily the only person there) laughing his head off.  Aside from that I didn't embarrass myself too much.  More importantly I didn't embarrass myself in front of the girl I'm currently trying to charm, so all in all a good night.  Later . . .

         Next time we'll not worry   That  urlLink roundabout 's nothing to worry about.  Okay, so it wasn't that busy this morning, but it wasn't as bad as everyone made out.  It might be a different matter on Saturday, but fuck it, let's hit it.  Later . . .

         Next time we'll keep the glasses off   My photocard driving license has come back.  It's another glasses-off photo, and whilst I didn't like the photo when I posed for it, it doesn't look too bad on the card.  I've got a funny little smirk in the photo, which I probably could have done without, but all in all . . .  So, tomorrow morning, bright and early, I begin my 'crash' course.  I've had lots of encouragement from friends and colleagues, which has been helpful.  I'm still nervous about the test, but a little less so.  If I can hit the  urlLink magic roundabout , and come out intact (and in the right lane :) ) I'll be more than happy.  (as an aside, I've just discovered that someone wrote  urlLink a song  about it -- ROTFLMAO!)

         Next time we'll say it   Drunk.  I caution myself not to say anything to Demise, because I'll mess it up.  I almost do though, as it's doing my head in.  Next time, drunk or not.  Enough is e-fucking-nough.  Apparently she's taking me (and others) on a shopping trip to London in a couple of weeks.  A shopping trip?  There's only one reason I agreed to this, and I'm beginning to think that it was a stupid one.

         Next time we'll buy a laptop   Written on my week in Abingdon:   --23 03 2004   Every time I go to Didcot I feel as though I'm in  The Simpsons , because whenever I look up I see the cooling towers at Didcot Power Station.  Everywhere you go in the area, they are there, because there's nothing else quite so big.   It's not a nuclear power station, so that's where the similarities end, but the association is already there.  Coming from The Sticks, cooling towers were opening-credits-of- The Simpsons  first, and power stations (of whatever kind) second.  I'd seen the cartoon, long before I'd ever seen one in the flesh.   It's why, if you're unfortunate to find yourself sitting next to me on the bus home, you'll hear me whistling the theme tune.  Excellent.    --23 03 2004   Evenings are fairly quiet so I've printed up a few of the  Talecrafters  stories to review.  Having only a portable TV in my room is a godsend.  It means I only have the regular six channels, and as there's never anything on that I want to watch, I don't watch.  I have it on in the background, but I'm working quite well.    --23 03 2004   The main source of dissatisfaction since I started my career has been the difference between what I imagined a career as an engineer would be like, and the reality.  I joined this profession to solve problems, to think, to design, to act (as D-2 puts it, 'to sustain and improve the quality of people's lives').  I didn't become an engineer to worry about money --(read cost)-- and comprimise.  If I had wanted to be a manager, I would have done an MBA at university.   This morning my boss and I undertook a little brainstorming to solve a problem he's been working on.  Just throwing ideas around and trying to come up with a solution.  I enjoyed it.  It's restored my faith work somewhat.  I know that soon enough I'll be back to writing reports and making money the chief factor in all of our decisions, but that's a rant for another time.  For now it's thinking time, and it's looking a little less grey.    -- 23 03 2004   I forget what I've written here, most of the time. My friends occassionally come up to me and make reference to a joke I might have made, or talk to me about something that I  know  I haven't told them about, and it confuses the hell out of me.  I have no doubt that in a couple of weeks someone will mention  The Simpsons  or lightning strikes and I'll just stare at them blankly.    -- 25 03 2004   'Well, thanks for sharing your little secret! But don't worry, it won't go any further . . . I'm not sure why you were so worried about it, I'm not the sort of person that would have a problem with that, but glad you told me.'   So I tell my ex that I fancy her mate, and she takes the news well.  Damn her.  It makes me feel like a bastard, because I know that if our roles were reversed I'd go mental.    -- 26 03 2004   There's a picture of Anna Kournikova pinned to the notice board.  Some days it's the only thing that gets me through to 6.

         Next time we'll not have a next time   My computer's on its way out.  It's crashing on me, hanging on me, making increasingly bizarre noises, and, quite frankly, I'm amazed I even managed to get online at all.  There might be another post later, if my luck holds out.

         Next time we'll comment on how hell has frozen over    I don't know how you do things in Australia, dear, but in England a full English breakfast is more than just bacon, sausage and beans.  Here we call this bacon, sausage and beans.   I can tolerate sleeping in a room that smells of cigarette smoke . . . for one night . . . but at breakfast the two guys behind me smoke whilst I'm eating.  That is just fucking rude.  I can't say anything because there are ashtrays on the table, but it still pisses me off.  A tick goes in the 'Never again' column next to the Bell Inn in Wantage.  It was already pretty close, but this is the last fucking straw.    Next time we'll get wet   'arwell IBC is built on an old military airfield, as you may have gathered from the  link  I posted a couple of days back.  When the wind blows, there's nothing much to stop it, and it can whipp around at a fair old pace.  When you get rain  and  wind, the rain comes at you pretty much horizontally.  And fast.  This was the case this morning, when I got off the bus and went the wrong way, adding five minutes and about 5 gallons of water to my journey to the office.    Next time we'll fire up the printer   Nothing much to do last night, and it occured to me that next week I could print up some of the  Talecrafters  stories and do a bit of critting in the evenings.  Last night I did a bit of plotting, moving some scenes I last looked at some time towards the end of last year.  No great progress, but I'm hoping that if I carry on doing this inbetween reviewing, I might even be able to start writing it.  Later . . .

         Next time we'll go nuclear   The second presenter on the  urlLink nuclear reactor seminar  is a South African guy with an Albert Einstein novelty tie.  I wasn't even aware there was such a thing as an Albert Einstein novelty tie, but apparently there are.  He wears it with a certain pride.  The video showing the decommissioning of a nuclear reactor is filmed with time lapse photography, to show how quickly the work is progressing.  I begin to wonder whether Benny Hill ever filmed anything at 'arwell.  There's a girl (from Cyprus, I think) named Miranda who is hot.  Best of a good bunch, as it turns out.  After seeing hardly any women since I came to the monastry, it comes as quite a pleasant surprise that there are quite a few women in the nuclear industry.  The majority of them nice and friendly, although one or two were short and moustached and ignorant.  We're told of terminally ill people eating depleted uranium in the name of medical research.  We're told that we can't be told stuff, because our --(read 'my')-- clearance isn't high enough.  We're told about  urlLink Cerenkov radiation , which I think is pretty cool (even cooler when we actually got to see it this afternoon).  We're told about bandsaws and  urlLink giant catapults  and neutrons and 'Reactor pressure wessels'.  We go out for a girl's birthday:  Delegate: 'You were born in seventy eight, and you're 26?  Your birthday must be late in the year then?'   I couldn't resist:  Do you not think it might have been in March?   I have to admit, I feel a little guilty.  It got the laugh I expected --(read 'needed')-- but I think I might have seriously embarrassed the poor guy.     Next time we'll get the train   My driver is so keen to get shot at he is  urlLink going to Iraq  now, rather than three weeks from now.  Guess I'd better stop calling him my driver.  Guess I'd better pass my driving test.  Later . . .

         Next time we'll get the bus   The urgency of getting a driving license has been stepped up a little by my driver's news that he wants to get shot at.  'I might be going to Iraq.  The job we were going for has fallen through, but it seems we've won another one.'  He's told me that if it goes through, he goes on the 4th of April.  My driving test is booked for the 3rd.  Hmmm.    Next time we'll give you a bit more notice   I'm going on a  urlLink nuclear reactor seminar  over the next three days.  The opportunity to go only came up on Friday, which means I've spent the weekend rushing around trying to get everything organised.  But, it's a chance to get out of the office for a couple of days, so I'm more than happy to go.  There's a couple of social events as well -- I'm joining the British Nuclear Energy Society, apparently -- so it's a chance to meet some new people.  Later . . .

         Suddenly he went driving in my car   Someone at 'Alcrow's trying to jinx my efforts to learn to drive by trying to sell me his car.  I'd have to buy it before I took my test.  I'm tempted, but if I buy it and fail, then I'm left with a car I can't take on the roads without supervision. I might not fail, but then again it might be years before I get that full license.  You hear of people failing twice, six times, hell, even ten times.  Did a bit of research on car insurance last night.  Now, I was expecting it to be expensive, but I wasn't expecting quite a range.  The lowest quote I received was 600, and the highest was 1150.  That 600 quote was for TPFT as well.  More looking is called for.    Suddenly he went blind   I have my contact lenses.  Woohoo!  For the first time I've seen what I look like without glasses (other than in photos, of course).  I've also been able to see what I look like in sunglasses.  It's all very exciting :)  Of course, I can't get the fucking things in my eyes, but there you go.  Amazingly, Donald and Aitchison fucked things up again.  I got there yesterday to find out they booked me an appointment with the wrong guy.  'You need a teach,' he said.  'I don't normally do those.'  I was too amused to get angry, and didn't really stop laughing until I got out half an hour later.  Coming home, I walked passed Ciao, from 'Alcrow, and she didn't recognise me.  Even when I waved at her she did a little double-take before she realised who this grinning crazy person was.  Hehe.  I'm going to enjoy this.  Biggest one is going to be my parents at Easter.

         Suddenly he went to 462   Some wag has scrawled 'Robert' above the sign that says PLANT ROOM.  Yet another has scrawled 'Oven' above the sign that says GLOVES.  Damn, it's funny here.    Suddenly he went to bingo   Went to the pub with my ex last night.  It's a proper chav place, which I never really noticed before.  It was pub quiz night, which meant that conversation was nigh on impossible.  At the end of the night they had a round of bingo.  This is cause for much excitement.  My ex goes to the bar.  Caller: 'Five and nine, the Brighton line, fifty-nine.'   Every other person in the pub: 'Whoo-whoo!'  I swear I was almost in tears by the time she returned.  Despite this unusual school-night excursion, I managed to crit last night, although I was unable to get any writing done.    Suddenly he went back to his desk   The worst job in the world, part one:  There's a low risk that we might have breathed in air-born contaminants on our tour.  Standard procedure is to ask all visitors to blow their noses and put the tissues into little bags that are then sent off for analysis.  My driver: 'Does someone have to check those for contaminants?'   Radioactive man: 'Not all of them.  It's a random sample.'  I really pity the guy who gets to do that during flu season.  Talk about job satisfaction.  Later . . .

         Suddenly he went too far   Friday night we go out to celebrate half of 'alcrow's birthdays.  I get drunk.  I get on Demise's case about her ex, probably forever ruining any chance of anything happening with her.  Shameful makes her cry, which doesn't help.  Other than that it's a good night.  My John Travolta impression fails to impress anyone, but I give it a good try.    Suddenly he went quiet   Coops chooses to watch the rugby in a pub full of green shirts and Irish accents.  When the Irish give us the pounding we deserve, they are annoyingly vocal, and the English contingent in the pub disappears fast.  We follow suit -- I can't deny them their right to celebrate, nor deny that I would have been just as loud had we actually played like the world champions, but I don't want to listen to it.  There are too many smug grins in green here.  I can claim Irish descent, but when it comes to sport (esp. rugby) I'm 100% English.  It would have been hypocritical for me to cheer them after I'd spent the last two weeks telling anyone who would listen that we were going to 'spank the paddies all over Twickenham'.  The Gourmet Burger Kitchen purports to be the 'best burgers in London'.  That's a stretch.  The burgers are nice, but not really worth the price.  Then again, nothing's really worth the price in London.  Noddy jokes that Coops is gay.  It's a running joke, and one I've heard mentioned before.  It's one I've made on several occassions myself.  So then, he didn't really need to give Noddy and myself more fodder by taking us to a gay bar.  We should have twigged something earlier really, but isn't until we're inside and notice the men kissing that the penny drops.  First reaction is to high-tail it.  I guess I would have been comfortable enough to stay in there and have a drink, but there's one thing missing.  I come to London to make clumsy attempts at chatting up good looking women, and there just isn't enough in here.  Those that are here, probably aren't on the pull.  Those who are on the pull are probably need to rethink their strategies somewhat.  I, being the wit that I am, spend the rest of the night singing 'Girl, I want to take you to a gay bar'.  Coops seems to take it in relatively good humour.  We go to a club.  The club has too many men inside, some woman with a clipboard and a power trip tells us, but they don't try to balance this by letting women in ahead of the queue.  This works partway to my favour, as I then get a chance to make clumsy attempts at chatting up the three girls standing behind me.  Don't get anywhere, but I do dance with one of them for a while later on.    Suddenly he went over it again   I keep getting these questionnaire things in my inbox.  So instead of filling them out a dozen times, I'm going to post it here and send people a link back.  I'm a busy man :)  Questionnaire the first.  Received from Bamyes on Monday, 8 March 2004.    1. WHAT COLOUR PANTS ARE YOU WEARING? Black boxers   2. WHAT ARE YOU LISTENING TO RIGHT NOW? Computer hum   3. WHAT ARE THE LAST 4 DIGITS OF YOUR  PHONE NUMBER? 4453   4 WHAT DID YOU LAST HAVE TO  EAT?

Okay, let's add I'm Alan Partridge, The Office . . .     Suddenly he went back to old material   So, stuck for anything new to post this month, I've put the reworked version of  Curiosity  up at the Talecrafters and the 'shop.  Basically it's had a few changes since the last time it was workshopped, but the main thing is the ending has been rewritten.  I've already had one reviewer said they didn't get why Lindsey was punished when it was Becka who broke the rules.  What is the worse punishment?  Drowning, or thinking that your sister has drowned but never knowing for sure, knowing only that she seems to have been punished for your mistake?  No contest if you ask me.  I think I'm going to leave it as it is unless lots of people say it is stupid.  Later . . .

         Suddenly he went home early   Friday rocks!  Home already, and I'm not due to go out tonight until at 8, so the plan is to try and get a bit of writing/reviewing in the interim.  Looks like I'm going to London tomorrow, so I'd better get something done.  I can see Saturday and Sunday getting written off.  Later . . .

         Suddenly he went without   I realised that I don't have anything to post for the  urlLink Talecrafters  this month so I've decided that I'm going to drag out  Curiosity  again.  I revised it after the last lot of reviews it had (about a year ago now, I guess), but I never did anything more with it for some reason.  I don't know why, guess I just forgot about it.  The group writing exercise begins this month with the creation of our main protagonist's aspects.  I've been given the task of creating his job/trade and describing what he uses to do this.  I must try to remember that this is a serious exercise, otherwise I'll give the fellow (assuming it's a guy?) the most boring or stupid job I can think of.    Suddenly he went back upstairs   First siting of an attractive, but more importantly  young  woman in my building today.  It was only a fleeting glance, so I've no idea whether she works here or was just visiting, but in this monastry it's almost something to get excited about.  Later . . .

         Suddenly he went 'didn't want to do that'   Had my safety induction today.  It was all fairly normal 'lift with your knees, not your back' stuff with only really two points of note.  The first was the police constable, who seemed more concerned with underlining the fact that the UKAEA constabulary was a real police force than anything else.  I must have heard 'We're not security guards' a half dozen times this morning.  The other was that a moustached Harry Enfield gave the fire safety talk. Didn't remind me of any specific character, but if he did a character who was a fireman then it would be this guy . . . except this guy was funny.    Suddenly he went trucking   Yorkie go in search of irony:  Latest advertising slogan:  It's  not  for girls!    Latest promotion:  Live like a pop idol!   I don't think I know any man that would get excited about that.    Suddenly he went all non-ugly   The photograph taken for my security pass is probably the best one in years.  I had it taken without my specs, and the results were actually quite pleasing.  Okay, I'm not going to be appearing on any magazine covers, but I'm at least up to Kid Presentable.

         Me and my story    I'm back in the old office for a day, and I was checking through my missed emails when I found this from Doyle Wilmouth at   Rogue Worlds   (04/03/2004):   Hello Kevin,   I recently filled all my fiction slots until April 2005 issue of "Rogue Worlds."  So this is not a rejection letter for your work.  I do apologize for the inconvenience but I don't like to stock pile manuscripts more than a year in advance.  This keeps me from having to tell authors that their work will appear a couple of years down the road.  Something I don't like.   Well, it says it's not a rejection, so I'm only going to count it as a half.  Means I've got start looking at the markets again.

         Me and my freaky dancin' shoes    So, more drinking on a school night last night, yet strangely enough I felt fine this morning.  No hangover.  Only slightly dehydrated.  It's amazing.  I can remember a dozen of those 330 bottles of Grolsch and a double vodka and coke, yet I was up early this morning.  I was out with  my ex  and  Demise  last night to celebrate the fact that they didn't have to work today.  Good night, although my love of 80s music is fading somewhat.  I feel slightly guilty about egging on some kid who was trying to pull my ex, even though he didn't seem to have much of a chance and was in fact pissing her off a little, but not too guilty; she had neglected to tell me that Demise had invited some other guy out with the intention of pulling him.

For the safe return of the donkey, a ransom will have to be provided for a local charity.   Dont  (sic)  try to find the donkey or track us down as we have the swan vestas and a gallon of 4* at the ready. We have also hidden it from satelite  (sic)  view.   We await a reply.

         Me and my ginge   Embarrassment yesterday as I do not recognise someone who not only graduated from the same course as me, but also had the same tutor as me ( Professor Shush ), and also shared a couple of tutorials with me early in my third year.  More embarrassing as she was fairly certain she recognised me the first time we met (and yesterday was our third such meeting).  Took me best part of the day to make the connection.

         Me and my pint   Went to the pub on the corner for 'a swift one' yesterday after work.   Shameful  and  The Girl I See on the Stairs  bottle out early, but when  Gilly  gets his drinking head on (which happens after one), he becomes determined to keep it on.  Five pints and two glasses of wine later, and I struggle to maintain eye contact with the barmaid, who has breasts the size of footballs.  It's impossible not to look at them; they're only so big because she's overweight, but they draw the eyes like a car wreck.  I really shouldn't drink so much on a school night.

         Me and my monster   Watched   urlLink Monster's Ball   for the first time on Friday night.  Great film, although it seemed a little slow at first.  Good solid performances though, and surprisingly touching.  Incidentally,  urlLink this thread  over at IMDB had me almost crying with laughter (potential spoilers).

         Me and my rock star    'You ain't lived till you got head from a vampire.'   If  Queen of the Damned  killed the vampire genre for me [ urlLink entry ],   urlLink John Carpenter's Vampires: Los Muertos   just staked it through the heart when it tried to rise again, chopped it's head off and dragged it kicking and screaming into the sunlight.  I should have known better.  Jon Bon Helsing stars as James Woods.  For those of you who haven't seen it, go and watch the original again and save yourself a couple of quid.  I seem to remember that one wasn't too bad.  This film is a carbon copy of the first, made with inferior products.  Later . . .

         Me and my temper   Apparently I'm getting something of a reputation around my old work place as an angry drunk.  This is thanks to the story-telling efforts of  Shameful  and  D-2 .  The fact that  Shameful  only has one angry drunk story about me, and that  D-2  has only been out on the piss with me twice (and neither of them were Red Kev incidents), is apparently unimportant.  It's worrying to know that I'm talked about in such a way by my old work colleagues, but I suppose it's better than not being talked about at all.

         Me and my jungle   Went to the Rainforest Cafe in London last night.   Waida 's choice, but it wasn't all that bad.  A family restaurant, but there's nothing wrong with that as long as the kids don't annoy.  They didn't and we had a rather pleasant meal.  The waitress who served us -- Eve, if I read her writing right -- was rare.  Absolutely lovely smile and almost reason enough to go back there again.  She undercharged us for our meal, and I felt kinda bad about that when I realised.  Maybe I could go back and settle up :)

         Me and my motor    urlLink Daihatsu Charade .  We got our new lease car this morning, and it's a sorry piece of machinery.  It's rattly, uncomfortable at high speeds, and when I put the sun-visor down my height meant that I was unable to see anything further than about five yards ahead.  It's an ugly little thing as well.  I'm going to hold off judgement on what it's like to drive until I've driven it, but I'll say it doesn't like tall passengers much.  I laughed when I saw it.  'I wouldn't laugh,' Replacement Driver said.  'It's your car as well, as soon as you pass your test.'

         Me and my pie   Sometimes I wonder what I'm doing out here.  I have nothing to do again.  I asked my boss what he wanted me to do when I finished my last job, and after thinking about it for nearly two minutes he replied, 'I don't know'.  So now he's got me reading more background reports on a project that 'we might get the go ahead for if the one we're expecting to have to do falls through.'  I'd write, but it's hard to get away with when your boss is sitting two feet away.  So background report it is.  Later . . .

         Me and my zombie    urlLink  Dawn of the Dead   (potential spoilers)  The film we were going to see had sold out, so we chose this one instead.  Wish we'd gone for  Shaun of the Dead  now, at least that looks intentionally funny.  Avoid like a zombie plague.  Good bits: 'shoot burt reynolds', the sarcastic Steve (who looked as bored as I felt), the third act has plenty of momentum, and isn't actually all that bad.  Bad bits: unsympathetic characters, female lead is practically wallpaper and her romanctic element is pretty poor, gore is funny rather than scary, zombie baby, second act is mind-numbingly boring, all of the shocks can be predicted at least a minute before they happen (standing near a glass door?  Gee, I wonder if a zombie's going to jump at the glass from the otherside), zombie baby . . .  If you do choose not to heed my advice, then at least heed this.  As soon as the closing credits start --  as soon  -- get up and flee the cinema.  They've cut the credits with this weird and totally pointless epilogue, that adds nothing to the story, and underlines everything bad about the film you've just watched.  It's like the makers wanted to be sure they'd catch all the people who might have, at that point, been thinking to themselves 'That wasn't that bad'.  'Just wait a second,' they say, 'watch this, see what happens to them next.   Now  you tell me you haven't wasted the last two hours of your life.'  Later . . .

         Next time we'll miss it   For the first time in many years I stayed away from the rugby  urlLink sevens  up at the 'Club.  I toyed with the idea of going up, business as usual, but then decided that I didn't much want to stand around on my own for six hours.  I don't really know anyone up there and none of my friends are around this year.  Other than that Easter weekend has been pretty good.  Dancing with sexy Easter-bunny girls on Thursday.  Visiting grandparents on Friday.  Rugby and  urlLink Fusioneering  on Saturday.  Relaxing on Sunday.  Visiting a local art gallery with my dad on Monday.

Saturday: We're both out on a friend's birthday and she ignores me all night.   Monday: I am rather short with her in telling her that I didn't much like being ignored, so she stops speaking to me again.  So, today, I apologise to her.  It hasn't done me any good, as she's still not speaking to me.  I don't know why I bother.

         Next time we'll not scare them off   Saturday night wasn't all bad though.  Lots of work people out in the evening, and I had quite a laugh chatting with those guys.  Unusually (for me at least) some woman came over to me and tried it on whilst I was standing at the bar.  Women don't approach me as a rule, so I'm choosing to ignore the fact that I later managed to scare this one off.  I'm also assuring myself that she was fit, and denying that I had my beer goggles on.  (In fact, I had my beer contact lenses in, which is probably why she approached me in the first place).

Twenty-two and a half hours later, and I'm apparently up to test standard.  I'm confident about tomorrow.  Oh, and I absolutely nailed my emergency stop today.  You gotta love ABS.  Wish me luck :)

         All they left was a gaping plot hole    I swear that as long as one of us still lives, the sorceress will die.    urlLink  The Scorpion King    You know that as soon as one of the characters utters a line like that then all but one of them is going to die.  You realise this film really is as bad as you had feared it would be.  And to think I had high hopes for a film starring a guy named after a Nicolas Cage film.  Good bits: Kelly Hu; the fact that The Rock is actually quite funny at moments.  Bad bits: Dialogue; plot (which doesn't seem to allude to anything mentioned in  urlLink  The Mummy Returns  ); the fact that ancient Egypt is the most multi-national place on Earth (we have african-americans, native americans, hawaiians, mancunians, germans, new-yorkers, welsh -- come on, what degree of realism are we going for here?).  The funniest thing is, at The Rock's page at IMDB it lists all his wrestling pay-per-view events under his acting credits, so it looks like he's made 70-odd films.

         All they left was a bodyboard   Bank Holiday Weekend, and I turn down the opportunity to go on a surfing weekend with  Shameful ,  The Girl I See on the Stairs , and a few others, because it would have meant getting up at about 0700hrs.  I didn't get in until 0330hrs last night, so that was never going to happen.  Also, I'm not a surfer, so it would have meant watching the others surf for three days.  Might have been cool if the sun was going to come out, and if there was someone else on the beach watching with me.  Also, there were no more beds in their hostel, so I'd have been sleeping in a different place to them.  So, instead, I'm spending BHW alone in Swin.  Hmmm, maybe that wasn't such a great idea :)

         All they left was a final episode   I went out for a friend's birthday last night.  I was the first person to arrive at the pub -- I usually am -- but this time I was first by a clear hour.  The girls' reason when they finally arrived at 10.30?  They were watching the last episode of Friends.  If I'd had to wait an hour on my own I would not have been happy, but I got to chatting up some Swindon Chav and the time passed fairly quickly.  It was a good night, but I'm beginning to think that I really need to get myself another gf.  It happens too often lately that I'm the first person out, and sometimes (usually when I'm in Kings waiting for  Big Ron  or  Student With No Razor ) I can end up waiting on my own for half an hour or more.  I wouldn't care what time they showed up if I came out with someone.  And I don't suppose it would hurt to get laid every once in a while :)  Later . . .

         All they left was the fury   I was on a training course with  The Girl I See on the Stairs  yesterday, and when we finished the weather was so nice that we decided to go to the pub up the road for a couple of drinks.  Last night was written off.  I learn that the Red Kev stories [ entry ] circling around work have led one girl to start calling me The Fury.  I don't know whether to believe this or not.  If it's true, it's amusing, and a little worrying.  I learn that Stairs really doesn't like the girl I fancy.  I learn that I'm a persuader, a magnetic personallity (something else I'm disinclined to believe) and a joint problem solver.  Later . . .

         All they left was a yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum    -- Was the blond hair and the earring 'cause you were in a rock band or 'cause you loved pirates?   -- What?   --  Loved pirates! Just like me!    Watched  urlLink  Pirates of the Carribean: the Curse of the Black Pearl   last night.  I never thought I'd say this about a film based on a bloody theme park ride, but that was a cool film.  Good bits: Johnny Depp's performance; pretty much every single thing that Johnny Depp said; Kiera Knightley; the fact that there were no 'Oh dear, that's a bit too cheesy moments' through the entire film; undead monkey.  Bad bits: couple of plot holes that my co-viewers couldn't help themselves from pointing out (okay, I would have done the same thing had I got there first); Legolas' facial hair; distinct lack of dwarf for Legolas to banter with.

         All they left was one angry learner driver   The DSA vehemently claims that there is no quotas they have to reach for fails/passes each day, but on days like today you can almost believe there is.  I'm so angry about this.  The examiner failed me for signalling incorrectly at a roundabout (even though I was doing exactly what my instructor always told me to do -- signal right if the 'straight ahead' exit is right of dead centre), and for passing through a set of traffic lights as they turned amber.  To stop in time, I'd have had to do an emergency stop, and probably would have ended up wearing the car behind me.  I'm so fucking angry about this.  I can't talk to anyone at the moment, because if I do I'll probably end up shouting.  At least the first time I failed the reasons given were just (well, at least understandable).  But to fail me for what are essentially a couple of minor points is outrageous.  The rest of my drive was fine; only a couple of other minors, and I nailed the manoeuvres.  The worst thing about the whole affair was that when he was talking me through it, there was to be NO DISCUSSION.  I knew that I couldn't get him to change his verdict, but I at least wanted to explain my actions.  No, he was determined to explain that 'I am right, and that's that' (his exact words), and he just talked right over the top of me.  Arsehole.

         All they left was a couple of notes that didn't make a great deal of sense   In more positive news, I returned to  Home  yesterday and began working on that again.  It's been a while (-read: I've been phenomenally lazy-), but after reading back a bit I was able to get a couple of pages down.  Hopefully it won't be another six months before I look at it again.  I'd like to get the first draft finished before November, so that I can start a new project when NaNoWriMo rolls round again.  Later . . .

As soon as I sent that post, it really started fucking me around, crashing about five minutes after I turned it on.

This week, my intellimouse is disrespecting me.  Every so often, it just up and freezes, the little light goes out, and the mouse refuses to work.  Whilst I'm perfectly capable of using my computer without the mouse, it's a pain in the arse.  If a woman disrespected me this much, I'd have asked her out by now.

         All they left was a language barrier   Pizza with  Demise ,  my ex  and her friend last night.  I discover that the guy Demise is dating is an idiot :)  Just how uninterested do you need to appear before this girl gives up on you?  There's no awkwardness between Demise and I, which is cool, although her question 'Are you going out with anyone?' midway through the evening perplexes me.  Has someone been babysitting your head this last couple of months? [ urlLink entry ]  We go to the pub afterwards, and meet up with some guys from work celebrating a birthday.  My companions go home at chucking-out time, so I tag along with these guys to the nightclub.  I seem to be following old and  urlLink familiar patterns  here, but I'm willing to go with it.  The new guys are all foreigners, and conversation ranges from easy (the lebanese guy I first met at  urlLink Newquay  whose English is better than mine) to impossible (the chinese guy who is hammered when we meet in the pub).  So, I choose to dance, and spend the next two and a half hours throwing some crazy shapes.  My legs ache like a bitch now, but it was worth it.  Had a really good night considering it was all a bit last minute.  Later . . .

I will not be ignored :)  I don't care if you do have work to do . . .  Tris' answers:    Where did we meet?    Could have been any number of occasions, depending on which you count.  Probably Graphics with Reeves, but properly in Prowsey's tutor group.   I forgot all about that.  Damn, I had us meeting five years later than that.    Do you remember one of the first things I said to you?    No, probably something sarcastic, or something in reaction to my sarcasm.   Heh.  That's true.  We were sarcastic fucking teenagers.    What is the best feature about me?    Your jammy house in Devon ;p   Well, that's actually the best feature about my parents.    What's your favourite memory of me?    Prolly something involving driving around Devon making sarcastic remarks and hilarious hypothetical reasons for why another mate of ours has bailed on us.   Heh.  Four summers like that.  ULI.

What's my favourite type of music?   What is the best feature about me?   Am I shy or outgoing?   Would you say I am funny?   Am I a rebel or do follow all the rules?   Any special talents?   Would you consider me a friend?   Have you ever seen me cry?   If there was one good nickname for me, what would it be?   Describe me in one word:   What's your favourite memory of me?

We have really missed him and want to give him a big hug.   There have been a further 9 donkey messages [ urlLink entry ].  Aside from the raging debate as to whether he was a horse or a donkey, the kidnapee now appears to have been freed.  I am a little worried about the most recent message, though.

An afternoon of sitting on the mown grass of the back garden, listening to the  Reloaded 2  album, and drinking cans of Grolsch that hadn't ever stood a chance of being allowed to chill.  The summer's inaugural barbecue in the evening.  More drinking as the sun disappeared from the back garden.

         All they left was a bus journey   Made it 5-for-5 last night.  Somehow.  Went out with the guys celebrating the rugby sevens, and I was supposed to be meeting up with  My Ex  and  Demise , but I didn't manage it in the end.  Fancied I could have a night out without them for a change, and it went pretty well.  Saw a girl that I fancied when I started at 'alcrow.  Haven't seen her in about a year, and I made the mistake of asking  Shameful , who appears to know her, what her name was.  So he tells me, and then calls her over, saying 'Kev used to fancy you.'  I think I managed to recover enough not to come over as a complete idiot.  I'll find out when I next see her, no doubt.  Later . . .

This is unprecedented . . .  . . . but at least I have a reason for not getting any writing done (or anything for that matter).  So the challenge was, on discovering that the woman I had been chatting up was 29 years old and not 24 as I'd assumed, to tell her that I'd thought she was 24 without making it sound like a cheesy pick-up line.  I failed miserably, which was a shame, because she was fit, and quite talkative to boot.  Later . . .

Whilst it wasn't what I was expecting, I have to say that I really enjoyed this film.  Says something about the quality of a film when Kirsten Dunst dancing round in her underwear isn't the best thing in it, isn't the first thing you take away from the cinema.  I'm trying to think of a criticism of this film, and so far I'm drawing a blank.  The more I think of it, the more I believe this was a great film.  Later . . .

Is there a donkey and a horse?   Have the donkey kidnappers got the wrong person?   Who owns the donkey? (6th May)    Perhaps the owners of the Donkey don't read the bulletin board or they would have posted an answer by now? The prime suspects are the UKAEA Constabulary but we've never seen them at it! Please come forward soon as we miss seeing him around the place.   Please help me (9th May)    I have just escaped from the clutches of the evil kidnappers and managed to find a computer to broadcast a plea for rescue. Please pay the ransom. I hear them coming now to recapture me. I will just have time to submit this message. They are breaking down the door now. Arggghhhhhh!   Horse or Donkey (10th May)    Stories of my demise have been exaggerated, I am a horse and not a donkey and I will be appearing in a location near you very soon.   Thank you for all your kind thoughts and wishes. My twin knows nothing, campaign for his release.   This is the sort of thing I would have done at school.  The worrying thing is that there are now at least three people posting donkey messages, and none of them are me.  The decay is obviously spreading.    All they left was a couple of slices of tomato    Chichavster  was back in Swin last night, so a few of us went out for tea and a couple of pints.  Once more I'm the only one in a group of four drinking.  I return to the house, and get accused of being p!ssed because I was 'very cheery'.  Later . . .

I usually take advantage of this to save myself a bit of cash.  Today, I get an email telling me they're unable to get one of the items on my latest order, but 'we can confirm that you have not been charged for it'.  However, a couple of hours later I can get a confirmation of dispatch, and because the price is now below 25 (through no fault of my own), they've charged me 3.93 P&P.  Cheap bastards.

         Leaving Malborough Village Hall    I went to an alehouse I used to frequent   And I told the landlady my money was spent   Sat down to watch  my nan 's 40th wedding anniversary video this weekend.  It was shot in September 1992, when I was but 12 years of age.  Thankfully, I only appear in the video once or twice, as the cameraman was concentrating more on the laudable dancing skills of the older guests --   (and here was I thinking the Welsh were bad dancers.  The Irish do themselves no favours here, up to forty people all performing the same one-step dance moves -- it's like the whole room can't decide between walking forwards and walking backwards, and guys, no ones going to arrest you if you move your arms once in a while)   -- but the point I was trying to raise, was that I was one  funny -looking kid when I was 12, and I guess the reality of that's only sinking in now I can look back a dozen years.  A lot scrawnier than I am now (I hadn't discovered beer yet, and thus hadn't set about building the gut), I appear to be all head.  Just this massive head and an impressively bouffant hair-do with a stick of a body floating around underneath.  How this kid ever turned into the handsome specimen you all know and love is a mystery :)  Another worrying thing is that -- at 12 -- I'm already one of the tallest people in the room.

         Leaving London    King Rat  by China Miville.  I want to reaffirm my statement that China Miville is some kind of insanely talented god.  Okay, this book is nowhere near as vast in scope as  Perdido Street Station  or  The Scar , but the language is every bit as beautiful, the writing and plot every bit as relentless, the characters every bit as sympathetic.  It's also nice to see that he can write an urban fantasy with just as much skill as he writes the other.  London takes on a new look, one that is dark and teeming with things unseen.  The descriptions of Drum and Base music, and the associated scene, are clear enough for me, an outsider with no knowledge, to understand.  Miville translates his passion for the city and the music to the page amazingly well.  As a writer Miville both inspires me and plunges me into deep regions of self doubt.  Since reading this book I've bounced between two trains of thought: one, that all writing should be this good, and that this is something to aspire to; and two, that I should give up now, throw away my pen, because I will never write anything a quarter as good as this man.  It's worrying.  Later . . .

         Leaving Fusion Squared   Went Fusioneering with  urlLink  Tris  ,  Tom  and  Big Ron  again Saturday night.  Tom, who last time ended the evening by slapping me round the face twice [ urlLink entry , towards the end], decided that he neede to hook me up with someone and grabbed the nearest girl to hand and said 'Talk to Kev'.  Why did it have to be a brummie?  Don't get me wrong, she was a nice girl, but that accent, man . . .

         Leaving the States    Scotty doesn't know that Fiona and me   Do it in my van every Sunday.   She tells him she's in church but she doesn't go   Still she's on her knees and Scotty doesn't know!   urlLink  Eurotrip  .  Not a bad brainless 90-minutes of fun.  Some very funny moments, offset only by a few moments of dubious taste (even for a teen comedy) and some sporadic lapses in research on the part of the writers.  Still an enjoyable way to kill an evening.  Good bits:  Scotty Doesn't Know  song ; the guy on the train; the idiot side-kick character.  Bad bits: the fact that I can't look at Michelle Trachtenberg without thinking  Buffy's younger sister, and  serious  jailbait,  and feeling guilty, even though she's eighteen years old, and shown in a sexual light (and rightly so, because she is hot); the fact that on a map of Europe, the Republic of Ireland is coloured with the Union Jack, which is just lazy research; the fact that apparently the best thing about England is 'No drinking age'--  (we have a drinking age here -- 18 -- we just try and get around it)   -- which is just lazy research; and dressing up a five-year old boy as Hitler, complete with Nazi salutes --   (I'm all in favour of taking the piss out of the  urlLink Germans , but for fuck sake, it's been  60 years , surely even American scriptwriters are cleverer than that?)   -- which is both lazy comedy and tasteless as hell.

         Leaving Calla Bryn Sturgis    No writing to speak of last night, but I did watch England's  final group game , and finish reading  Song of Susannah (The Dark Tower VI)  by  Stephen King .  The match was good.  Tense as hell in places, but most of the time we played quite well.  Wayne Rooney consistently outclasses everyone else in a red shirt, but no complaints here as long as he's still scoring goals.   Song . . .  is good.  I had a few reservations about the lack of time given to Jake and the Pere, and the inclusion of the author as a character in his own work, but by the end you could see that both of these had a reason for being there, and they were both handled very well.  My only real complaint with the story is with how it ended.  Reassuring then, that  The Dark Tower VII  is to be released in September, which is only a three month wait.  Hopefully then, we'll see these issues (and the whole story, in fact), wrapped up.

         Leaving Soda    -- Do you think your housemate might be an alcoholic?   -- Which one?   Went out for  Shameful 's birthday last night, and as  urlLink I suspected , I wasn't really up for drinking right up until I got that first pint out of the way.  Things got better after that, though :)   urlLink That girl  came out :)  First time I've seen her since last month, although I'm still unsure of whether she's single or not.  Scary fat chav woman tried pulling every guy in our group.  Had some sober guy from work acting as my unofficial bodyguard, saving me every time the scary woman tried dancing with me or talking to me.  Was a little strange.  Later . . .

         Leaving early    urlLink England  won their second, and rather crucial, Euro 2004 game last night.  True to form they scored their first goal whilst I was up in the gents.  Luckily, I didn't miss it because the pub has TV's set in the walls above the urinals.  Gotta love the  urlLink Walkabout .  Drank far too much yesterday.  Was in the pub by three o'clock and  my ex  is convinced we had eleven pints of lager.  Suffering for it this morning, but it was worth every drop.  I have to say I'm proud of her, most of the girls I've been out with have been serious lightweights.  My ex's friend is watching the game with us.  She has huge breasts.  Never has the word 'England' looked so good.  Never has it been harder not to look at the word 'England'.  It's  Shameful 's birthday today, so I'm due to go out again tonight.  Not feeling up for it right now -- it's eleven o'clock in the morning, and I'm suffering in my office out at 'arwell -- but I'm sure I'll have got the love back by tonight.  Better well have; if I start missing stuff because I'm feeling unwell then I can't really justify taking the piss out of Shameful and  Gilly  when they do it every week.

         Leaving the Talecrafters   I've stepped down from active participation in the  urlLink Talecrafters  workshop.  I had planned on leaving it until July to tell them I was going to call it quits, but James emailed the group asking us to let him know if we were still in or not.  I had suspicions back in December that I wouldn't be able to make it work.  I've always said that I'm not going to start workshopping my current novel until the first draft is completed, and that's not changing.  I'm just not writing enough short stories to warrant staying in the group.  Sure, I could continue reviewing without actually submitting anything but, selfish as it sounds, I'd be working for nothing.  I want to get something out of the group if I'm going to be putting this much time in.  So, I've stepped down.  I think it's a good choice, although I do intend participating in some sort of review group when I finally get the first draft finished.  Just not yet.  Even though I'm fairly motivated at the moment, I just don't have that much free time.  Any of this free time spent reviewing, is time not writing.  Take last night, frex; by the time I'd got home, gone for a run, showered, ironed shirts for work, cooked and eaten tea, and washed up, it was nine o'clock.  Okay, every evening's not that bad, but it's just an example.  I want to review -- and I will try and get the odd one done -- but it's pointless doing that if I'm not actually writing.  Regardless of how much reviewing can help your own skills develop, the writing's got to come first.

         Leaving with my hair in a mess   Sometimes my vanity worries me.  I went on a few walkdowns at work this morning that required the wearing of a hard hat, so as soon as I could after we finished I got myself to a tap and a mirror so I could sort my hair out.  Damn, it's not even like there's anyone out here I would want to impress, not like it matters if I don't look my best when I'm surrounded by fifty-year old engineers and nuclear industry management, but no, I had to get rid of the hard-hat 'fro.

         Leaving Erith     The Lady of the Sorrows (The Bitterbynde, 2)  by  urlLink Cecilia Dart-Thornton .   If possible, even better than the first one [ entry , (although, I can't believe I waited a year and a half to read it)].  Cecilia's language is as rich and deep as before, but despite the long passages of description the writing is so good that you hardly even notice.  Imrhein/Rohain/whatever-name-she's-going-by-this-chapter, is a sympathetic character, and you really feel for her as she starts to get back what was lost from her.  You also feel her guilt as destruction is brought down on those around her for a reason that she doesn't know or understand.  The ending is nicely worked, and you look back on what came before feeling very satisfied.  Like Imrhein, we now have some answers, and nothing about them feels like a cheat or a weak effort.  Definitely recommended.  That thing with the names is my only real sticking point about this book.  She's known by about half-a-dozen by now, and as soon as a new one comes along it gets used pretty much exclusively.  After getting to know her as Imrhein, these new names irritated me a little.

         Leaving Salcombe   Notes from my weekend home:   -- 12 06 2004   The intention was there, so even though the sun wasn't yet out, I headed into Salcs.  Today is the Rig Regatta, so Cliff House Gardens (and town for that matter) is full of rower-types.  A good few of them are attractive.   I have my sun-glasses on, so the few people I recognise don't actually recognise me.  Bizarrely, the one person who does is Joe, Salcombe's embarrassing bad penny.  We talk briefly; I've never had much to say to him, and I find that hasn't much changed in the two years since I last saw him float into harbour.   I sit in the Garden and watch the rowing a while.   The intention is there, and eventually the Sun comes out.    -- 12 06 2004   It takes  my dad  and  my step-mother  two hours to ask if I've started wearing contacts.   My Nan  doesn't even notice.    -- 13 06 2004   I'm on the train.  It's a beautiful day -- blue sky, hot -- and I'm spending the best part of it on the train.   The guy behind me has just got stuck on the train seeing his dear old mother off, and now faces an hour-long detour to Exeter.  He's doing well keeping the tone of his voice light, but one look at his face tells me he is  pissed .  There's going to be some shouting when he finally gets off the train.    -- 13 06 2004   Went  urlLink Fusion eering last night with  urlLink  Tris  ,  Big Ron ,  Tom , and  Uffy .  No one mentions the fact that I'm not wearing glasses.   The club contains an unusually high number of women, and they're more attractive than I'd come to expect.  No joy, although I do have a bit of fun egging Tom on in his conquest.  I remember singing  Sexual Healing  with altered lyrics at him, but that's about it.  I've had that song in my head all weekend.

         Leaving Swindon   Am heading back to the Sticks this weekend, so going to be away from this thing until Monday.  Summer's finally here, so I figured I'd go back and annoy my parents and sit in the sun for a couple of days.  Want to get back a lot more than I did last Summer, because, really, a sunny weekend in Salcs and a sunny weekend in Swin don't compare.  Beer garden with scantily clad and attractive young ladies, or high street with scantily clad but overweight chav women.  Tough call.

I hunt down  Demise  and  my ex  and tag along with them.  We go to the Walkabout Inn in Swin (it's where you  always  end up when you go out with these two).  I don't mind; it's been at least a week since I've been there.  The women are fine and some more mates turn up later on.

I mind a little more than usual; it's been only 21hours since I've been there.  The women are old -- Saturday night is D&D night, it seems -- and I know no one else there.

         Leaving the Academy     What are you sad about?  Every day you make the sun come out.    A tip: if you want to see the band, don't stand behind me.  I'm taller than you.  My head is not going to suddenly become transparent when the band come on stage.  Trust me on this, I've been taller than you for twenty-four and a half years, and I've never been transparent.  Despite my resolution to attend more live music this year, yesterday marked my first gig of 2004.   My ex  and I watched  urlLink The Charlatans  at the Bristol Academy.  (and yes, I realise that I've spent pretty much all weekend with her)   The support act say they are Engineers, but I don't believe them.  Sure, they do a fairly good job of boring me, and they're an unattractive bunch, but there are not nearly enough checked shirts in evidence, and at no point do they talk about reinforced concrete or risk analysis.  The small stage at the Academy is crowded with all of the Charlatans' equipment, and it looks like Engineers are playing out of the back of a removal van.  I'm fairly sure the drummer is actually playing from the disabled toilet at the rear of the building.  The Charlatans are better.  Plenty of songs I recognise, which is helpful, because I don't own any of their albums.  My ex touches Tim Burgess' hand (and she's since told everybody about it).  I think taping a carrier bag around your hand is a little extreme, but there you go, she's quite the little fan girl.  I'm unable to understand the significance she attaches to merely touching a pop star.  I can envisage getting excited if your idol actually shook your hand or had a conversation with you, but being one of dozens of people who reached out and grabbed him when he walked around at the barriers during the show?  I don't get it.

         Leaving Mayhew     It's only blood, little brother.   Only blood.    I've just finished reading  urlLink  Preludes and Nocturnes  , the first collection of  urlLink Neil Gaiman 's  Sandman comics .  My impressions are mixed; a couple of stories I loved, a couple I thought were okay, and a couple I didn't think too much of (although I'm aware of the purpose they solve in the greater story).  (and yes, I'm aware that there are eight stories, and that that doesn't add up to eight)    Imperfect Hosts  is one of my favourites (the ending actually brought a lump to my throat), and  A Hope in Hell  is pretty good as well.  Absolutely loved the depiction of hell in this story.   The Sound of her Wings  is a nice epilogue.  On the other side, I felt  24 Hours  had some nice horrific touches but was ultimately unfulfilling, and that  Sound and Fury  was weak.

         Leaving West Bay   We went on an last-minute visit to a colleague's site in Bridport, Dorset this morning.  My first mistake: wearing the shirt that darkens so quickly when I sweat, when we were walking around a beach all afternoon.  My second mistake: managing to lose a high-visibility vest.  My third mistake: not taking something to read; that's a boring drive when all you have to listen to is Radio Five Live.  I learn that Audi's have no head room in the rear passenger seats, nor enough leg room to properly slouch.  I learn that opening the sun roof and winding all the windows up doesn't work unless you're doing about 70mph.  I learn that West Bay is the same as many other holiday towns on the southwest coast, complete with shitehawks, chip and fish shops, overpriced cafe's, and elderly tourists.  I learn not to order a ham sandwich from the Beach Cafe in West Bay.

A small place, but it was empty and the staff give consultations to ensure you get a trainer that suits your running style.

Seb  and one of his mates were out.  Seb didn't drink, so was able to save a bit of money by getting a lift in and out.

Four hours spent hoovering and cleaning this morning, and now I cannot stop sneezing.&nbsp; Took an antihistamine and it's done nothing.  So much for thinking that I wasn't going to suffer for my allergies this year.

        Without sight      urlLink Daredevil     Well, seeing as we're going through a bit of a comic-book film invasion at the moment, I thought it an ideal opportunity to catch  Daredevil  when it premiered on&nbsp;Sky Movies&nbsp;last night.&nbsp; And . . .   . . . and it's not as good as  Spider-man .&nbsp; Which isn't to say that it's a bad film (as I've heard many a Spidey-fan decry), it's just not a great one.&nbsp; It's darker, and a little less smooth in the flow, and I felt that some of the characters were underused and their relationships with other characters were not fully explored.&nbsp; But entertaining enough, and DD's back story was handled quite nicely.

        Without Jason Statham    urlLink  Jet Li's The One    Watched another film starring Jason Statham last night, and it's official I can't take anything this guy does as an actor seriously any more.&nbsp; He could be delivering Shakespeare, and I still wouldn't be able to watch without laughing.  The other night I saw part of  urlLink  John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars  , also starring one Jason Statham.&nbsp; Again, same result.&nbsp; Same hilarity.  Actually, looking through this guy's  urlLink CV  over at  urlLink IMDB , he's contributed to some truly awful movies.&nbsp;  The Italian Job (remake) ,  Mean Machine ,&nbsp; Snatch .&nbsp; He's like the King Midas of crap.  I'm tempted to watch his films in the future purely because I know I'll get a laugh.  (Oh, and  The One  should be avoided plague-like.&nbsp; Hole-ridden plot, tepid action sequences, crap parallel universe explanation -- here comes the science -- and an ending that disappointed in about a dozen different ways).

        Without Franny   Bit of a Mission reunion night&nbsp;on Thursday&nbsp;as two of the guys we used to go out with last year are back for the summer.&nbsp; Following watching a friend's gig in a pub (and half another band's set, whose name I didn't catch but was quite getting into), we strolled off to another pub.&nbsp;  Gilly  had his drinking head on, and suggested the drinking of sambuca, and then the drinking of Goldschlager (s?), and then the drinking of tequila.  Not a good idea.  Suffering for it yesterday, altho' luckily it didn't hamper my work any.&nbsp; Unlike Gilly, who took a hangover day and lay in bed all morning, and  Franny , who puked all over the cottage when he got back.  We moved on to the Apartments, and discovered it empty.&nbsp; Some stunning girl convinced us to move on to Poon's -- we were already planning on heading over there, but a kiss on the cheek sealed the deal for me :)  Franny didn't get in.&nbsp; The bouncer didn't give him any reason, just stopped him short.&nbsp; Hence how he was able to come back to ours and early and redecorate the bathroom before we could stop him.

        Without a safety net     urlLink  Spider-man 2     Kirsten Dunst is the reason I find red-heads attractive again.&nbsp; She is, simply, beautiful.  The rest of the film isn't bad either :)&nbsp; I couldn't help notice that they had another one of those 'New York people look after their own' moments that made me laugh so inappropriately during the original.&nbsp; It's funny that in a film about a guy who has superpowers after being bitten by a super-spider, battling a guy possessed by robotic snakes who is trying to create controllable nuclear fusion, this part is the part I had trouble believing.   I really can't find much wrong with this movie, though.&nbsp; Thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish.   Later . . .

        Without potato salad   Cooked up a storm at the barbecue yesterday, until  Si  decided that the guests weren't getting enough charcoal and took over the cooking duties.&nbsp; We were later getting started than planned, because a lot of the guests didn't arrive until 1830hrs or later.&nbsp; Unfortunately this meant that most people missed what little sunshine we did have, but it wasn't too bad.&nbsp; The kebabs  the Girl I See on the Stairs  and I prepared went down a treat, and we managed to produce a surprising amount of food for little cost.  As it started to get dark we went out to the green to play with an aerobie, staying out until it was so dark you could only tell that someone was throwing it to you when you saw their arms moving (and, a couple of seconds later, when it bounced off your unsuspecting forehead).&nbsp; Great fun.  Went to bed to discover that&nbsp; Seb  had placed a softball bat underneath my mattress, altho' I was drunk enough that it was a couple of seconds before I realised my discomfort wasn't due to me lying on the bed in a funny position.

        Without a little slice of lime   Went for a Mexican with  Si  and  the Girl I See on the Stairs  last night.&nbsp; I'm not a great fan of Mexican food so a great pile of refried beans and Mexican rice was left on my plate by the end, but the tacos and enchiladas were good enough.&nbsp; Those bottles of Sol went down well enough as well.  No one was really up for a big night out (except for  Gilly , and he was out on his own) so we came back to the Distant Past straight after the meal.&nbsp; Still managed to have about eight or nine bottles somehow.  Planning a barbecue this evening, because we've been promised good weather.&nbsp; Got about a dozen coming, by all accounts.&nbsp; Should be good.  Later . . .

        Without hope   Made a couple of posts yesterday, but the formatting was fucking around so I was forced to delete them.&nbsp; I'm not going to write them out again, so to summarise:   The Transporter : Silly film; inventive fight scenes (if somewhat improbable, because it's Jason Statham and not Jackie Chan doing them); crappy dialogue; ridiculous plot; enjoyable enough.   Orange County : Jack Black = good; gripe with the fact that writer spends no time actually writing in the movie (only moping . . . reminds me a little of me); gripe with the fact that Tom Hanks Jr. runs down to a completely&nbsp;flat sea at the end shouting 'I'm going surfing'.

         Without ice cubes   Went down to Marlborough for a friend of a friend's birthday drinks last night (I'd like to call her my friend, but I swear she hesitated when introducing me to  her  friends -- 'This is . . .&nbsp;Kevin').  Quite a&nbsp;nice night, and it made a change to be drinking somewhere other than Old Town in Swin.&nbsp; I don't mind Old Town in Swin, it's just nice to go somewhere different every once in a while.&nbsp; That obsession Old Town bars have with hip-hop grates after a while.  Marlborough is a lot nicer to be drinking in on a summer evening, it's just let down by its location somewhat ( Gilly  had to taxi us last night, and it's always a shame when one of the party has to be the responsible one).&nbsp; Marlborough has beer gardens though, and&nbsp;beer gardens that don't overlook busy roads.&nbsp; The pub we were in was nice, and not busy or too chavvy.&nbsp; If we'd been in Swin we'd have been surrounded by chav because Thursday night is Underage-Drinking night.

         Without sultanas   Went for a curry in 'the first Balti house' with  Big Ron ,   Tris  , and  Wes , and then went pubbing and eventually Fusioneering.  The Balti house tells us that 'Balti is the latest trend in Indian cuisine'.  It's been telling us this for six or seven years, and I wonder why more restaurants aren't doing it.  The Ship has the fittest barmaid in Devon.  Tris turns down an opportunity to talk to the young ladies that Wes was chatting up, because he can't 'be bothered'.  I despair on hearing this and wonder why I chose that moment to go for a walk.

         Without an eight-year age gap    Scallie  has blanked me the last couple of times I've been home.  Last night she seeks me out and spends most of the evening telling me about her sex life and moaning about the guy she wanted to pull.  Telling her that I didn't actually care about this stuff doesn't do me any good.  The weirdest thing is that when she first speaks to me she brings up a conversation we had over two years ago.  Totally randomly, like we'd not spoken about anything in the interim.

         Without chopsticks   Went for an all-you-can-eat buffet at Swin's chavviest Chinese restaurant on Friday night.  The food was quality, although they could done with bigger plates.  Sat next to a table full of scantily-clad, but super young, girls.  I'm talking so young that I felt  I should be put in prison for being in the same room as them.  Finally going to have to accept that I'm getting old; there was a point when I wondered where these girls' fathers were when they left the house dressed like that.  I swear one girl's skirt was so short I could see her arse-cheeks when she stood at the buffet.  God I'm getting old.  Was a time I would have just sat back and had a good perv.  One girl ate her eal with a chopstick in each hand for fifteen minutes.  It was only when they heard our entire table near killing themselves with laughter that one of her friends instructed her in the correct method.  The vodka bar we went to offers six shots for 8 (what it calls a speed stick).  We split one between two.  Seemed like such a good idea at the time.  Now, sat on a train that will take me west again, I'm not so sure.  Finished the night in the Walkabout.  Despite the fact that it's the fairly standard end to a night in Swin, I haven't been there in a while.  Finding it hard to say I've missed the place.

         Without restraint   Things are good financially at the moment.  I have money and no one to spend it on.  I'm far from rich (I didn't join this profession for the money -- no I joined it for the glamour), but I'm comfortable.  So I find myself being generous on nights out.  I'm first up to buy a round.  I buy people I hardly know drinks, friends of friends.  I paid for  my ex 's taxi home last week [ urlLink entry ].  I'm not trying to be flash; I like being able to share my earnings, and I've never been one of those 'short arms and deep pockets' guys.  I feel I should watch myself, though.  It was 50 last night, and I'm sure it will be about the same tonight.  I've got to be careful not to be taken advantage of as well.  Some people never put their hands in their pockets, and I can't pay for their nights out.  That would be silly.

         Without prices   Went to my first work garden party last night with  Shameful ,  The Girl I See on the Stairs ,  Janner Dan  and  my ex .  Really good night, but strange.  It was set in the grounds of my office hear, and by all accounts 1000 people came.  I can almost believe it, because I didn't meet half of the friends I knew were going (or any of the women that I wanted to dance at :)  Met up with an old uni mate ( Ed , whose gf works in one of 'alcrow's other offices.  Nice catching up with him again, and couldn't really believe that it's been two years since I last saw him (at graduation!)  We both agreed that we have to make more of an effort to get everyone together for some kind of reunion.  It's been too long, and we're just too crap at this . . .  There was a free bar until after ten o'clock.  My head's a little fuzzy this morning.  There were fireworks!  I've not watched fireworks in years, and this was a good display.  Must have been expensive :)  Plans to go into Swin afterwards to continue the drinkin' and dancin' went pear-shaped.  Ended up going home with my ex, because everyone else ditched us.

        Feeling nothing    Lord Foul's Bane (The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, The Unbeliever, 1)  by Stephen Donaldson.   Thomas Covenant . . .  is a fantasy classic that my friends have long been telling me to take up and read, and having recently picked up the omnibus version, I have finally got around to reading it.  It's taken me a long while to read this book, but I think that's down to the size more than anything else.  It's not a book I could easily carry around with me, so I've had to read other things on train journeys and the like.  It's certainly no detriment to the quality of the book.  Whilst it's probably not going to fall into my list of favourite books, I've enjoyed reading it, and will certainly go on to read the remainder of the trilogy.  Donaldson's voice is strong and unique enough to retain the reader's interest, and his descriptions stay in the mind long after a passage is read.  But the real stand out-point of this book is the characters.  Thomas Covenant is an odd anti-hero, refusing to believe that what he is experiencing is anything but a dream through fears that when he does wake up he'll go mad.  Despite his actions and his moods he remains a sympathetic character throughout.  This is helped by the people of the Land, whose Oath of Peace has made them a sympathetic and understanding people.  Only killing unless they have to, and never forcing anyone to do anything they don't want.  Through them we understand and accept Covenant's struggles.  Some people I've spoken with had issues with certain aspects of the piece, but I'm not going to go into too much detail here.  Later . . .

        Feeling saintly   Went to over to the County Ground to watch the Swindon-Southampton game last night. Swin lost 2-1, although Soton were not as good as I was expecting them to be (they're a whole two leagues higher than Swin), and Swin's defence sometimes lacked.  Had a good night despite the result, and surprised myself by how much I've missed going to the footie. Been a long while since I've been to a game, longer still since I've been a regular anywhere. One of my friends has just bought a season ticket at Swin. I'm not looking to be going to every game (my team's in green, no matter how loosely I follow them), but I might try and catch a match with her every now and then.  Later . . .

        Feeling Satanic    Wolf in Shadow  by  urlLink David Gemmell    The Dark Tower  comparisons are obvious.  Two stories about a loner, a religious man with a personal moral code, on a quest for something of great significance.  Both protagonists gunslingers.  Both of them already a good way into their quests when we first meet them.  Two worlds that have moved on.  Stories littered with references to our own world, popular culture and histories.  So, it's going to be hard to look at this story objectively :)  As ever, Gemmell's stories are a joy to read.  Relentless adventure that picks you up and carries you along until you reach the end.  Worlds and characters that stick in your head long after you finished, demanding that you read the next story in the sequence as soon as possible.  This is the first non-Drenai book of Gemmell's that I've read, and it's reassuring to discover that he's not a one-trick pony.  It's still quest-fantasy, but it's deeper and darker, the issues that he raises more challenging.  Jon Shannow will be compared to Roland Deschain.  It's inevitable.  I don't guess it's a bad thing.  I found him to be a likeable enough protagonist though.  His supporting cast were fairly well-rounded and Batik I liked especially.  Later . . .

        Feeling embarrassed   Mid-way through the afternoon,  Harmsway  tells us that  Maffew ,  Jose  and myself are going to have to compete for the positions of his Best Man and his Usher. We are told that we 'will be set challenges', the outcomes of which will be judged by him, his Fiancee  Laetitia , and  David  (who has already accepted the role of Witness). I begin to feel that I've stepped into an episode of  Friends . Best Man Challenge? Could we  be  any more American?  I wonder why he's doing it this way.  Al , the notable fourth contender, is absent, and it's my opinion that  Maffew  should be the Best Man anyway. I wonder just how Harmsway is planning on embarrassing us.  We've gathered to celebrate Harmsway and Laetitia's engagement. It's our first such reunion in nine months, and everyone's in good spirits. The new couple look very good, and very happy together. We sit on a crowded waterfront all afternoon, enjoying the return of summer.  A table of bunny girls celebrate a hen night across the restaurant from us. A challenge is set to obtain one pair of bunny ears and a fluffy tail. We do so, but only at the cost of a pair of underpants, and suitable embarrassment.  We share a toast with another of our absent friends, who is currently driving a truck-load of people around Equador.  We leave the restaurant, and I manage to embarrass myself by walking across Bristol with a fluffy bunny tail pinned to the back of my shirt. Many photos are taken.  I fall over whilst walking downhill, and because I'm drunk what should have been a simple tumble turns into several forward rolls. Somehow I manage to finish the move back on my feet, which is a display of drunken athleticism completely out of character. I sprain my ankle, so it's not all good.  We're told later in the evening that Maffew will be Best Man (like I said, not a total surprise), and the rest of us will be Ushers. At a French wedding. Should be amusing. Despite the fact that my CV says basic French, the truth of the matter is that I speak French like Derek Trotter. I have a year to brush up.  Getting a taxi at the end of the night is a veritable free-for-all. Nothing cheers up standing around for half an hour like an attractive bunny girl who's lost her ears and can't get home. Sadly, I'd thrown away my fluffy tail when I realised that I'd walked across Bristol as Bunny Boy, and she's going to the opposite side of Bristol to us, so I can't help her on either count.  The following day we have a barbecue and slowly boil in Harmsway's Sun-trap garden. Laetitia discovers that Worcester Sauce and cheese on a salmon grill is not a delicacy.

        Feeling things    urlLink  Equilibrium     I was preparing not to like this movie. The 'i'-button on the Sky remote described it as a ' Matrix -style actioner', which always usually means what you're about to see is an hour and a half of dodgy wire-fighting sequences, strung together with a plot you could use to drain pasta. Boy, was I surprised.  It's actually a really good movie. Christian Bale is rapidly becoming an actor I have a lot of respect for (even though I wasn't blown away by  urlLink  American Psycho  ), and I can't wait to see how he handles being Bruce Wayne. The action sequences are original, and anyone who says that the Gun-Kata sucks was obviously disappointed that the film didn't contain more  Matrix -style ridiculousness.  But the real surprise was the story. The idea is an interesting one -- society curbs human emotion in an attempt to stem man's more violent and distructive impulses -- but one you don't believe they'll be able to pull off without any conviction. But they do, and you find yourself immersed in this world. Bale's development from just another one of the emotionless masses to a sense-offender, is excellent, and his struggle to accept his new role in society is well handled. The emotion of many of the scenes stands out all the more because of the stark and restrained backdrop they are set against.  Definitely recommended.  Later . . .
