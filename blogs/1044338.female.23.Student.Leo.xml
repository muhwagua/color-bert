      Ok, now that I know that people are actually checking out this site and NOT leaving comments (read the RED side panal: we thrive on comments!)...I'll have to put up a controversial issue and ask for all your opinions. By now, I'm sure that most of you (if not all) have heard about the woman who cloned herself and is going to raise this clone as her own daughter. Do you guys think this is ethical or dehumanizing? Right or wrong? Post your answers...ready...set....GO!

      So how was everyone's boxing day? For me, it was the usual...insanity and fast-paced. Michelle and I decided to go to Kingsway Mall and NOT West Edmonton Mall...because then that DEFINETLY will be either stupid or crazy or both (no offense). We were too scared to go! Kingsway Mall was pretty busy as well, but I'm sure not to the extent of WEM. I haven't been to Kingsway in over 2 years, so I've forgotten most of what it's like. There's actually many good stores in that mall (if you're a girl!). Miche and I were saying how boxing day is such a load of BS, because most of the so-called "sales" are not really "sales anyways. They just lower the price from a ridiculous amount to what it SHOULD be in the first place. Regardless, everyone, including us, gets suckered into the world of consumerism. Ce la vie, n'est pas? 

  Apparently, I'm not the only freak in my family to go crazy with boxing day this year. My parents FINALLY decided to come to their senses and buy TEN (yes -TEN!!!) selves for storage from Home Depot. Long story short, if you've been to my house, you know what I am talking about...my parents are pack-rats. They keep EVERYTHING. Not sure if that comes with being Chinese...but my parents even have newspapers OLDER than me. They are sitting in boxes in the den, untouched, becoming more fragile and old and yellower every second. Dad plans to read ALL of these papers when he retires. Hello dad, what about the internet? We've got junk everywhere and it urks me! I guess not enough that I'll actually jump in and organize everything myself (too much time that I don't have required). Practically half our house (not exaggerating) is occupied by unused boxes, untouched items that are gathering dust. Gross. For years, I've complaint to my parents about how we need to throw things out or organize everything. 

   And just to SHOW you what I mean...here's the den in working progress...
  
 
 
 
 
Here's PART of my dad's newspaper collection (I don't think this is even half!) LOOK how YELLOW they are! EWW!
 
 
So as you see, my house is VERY *messy* (talk about an underrated word)  - acutally only half of the house is like this (it's mostly the den and the ENTIRE basement). Needless to say, I'm very proud of my mommy and daddy for finally getting organizers for our junk, so that instead of having it build on the floor, it can build UP the walls! :o)

      MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! Hope everyone had an awesome christmas day! Mine was low key, and that's the way I like it! Woke up around 10AM (haven't been able to do that in awhile) and  jumped on mom and dad's bed to wake them up. Talked to them for an hour there, then ate breakfast, and then opened presents. Which brings me to complain about how my brother is the worse cameraman ever! He used our camcorder to record the gift opening session, and when we viewed the tape later on, we realized he only focused on everything but the head! So we can see all the action, but can't tell who is DOING the action. It's kinda funny. Silly boy. The rest of the day, just chatted with some friends on the phone and had a big turkey dinner in the evening. It's almost midnight and I am STILL FULL.  After dinner, I made short bread cookies  and mom and dad helped me a bit. Mom accidentally put 2.5 cups of butter (EWWWW) instead of 3/4 cup and so we had to wing it by putting more flour and icing sugar in the ingredients AFTER the fact that we had refridgerated it 2 hours prior. Fortunetly, everything worked out fine. :o) YAY!
 
 
RANDOM CUTE PICTURE OF THE DAY: Mocha *not my dog, unfortunetly*! (he's kind of dressed christmassy!)
 
 
 
 So I know it's been awhile since I've posted (and NEVER since Dan's posted), but we've been pretty busy with the x'mas season rush. I'm going to take this time that I have to catch up from my last entry...and bonus...I figured out how to post pix (thanks to Kelly!) Since my last post, in case you're wondering, my soccer team is NOT doing better...I think we've lost our last 2 games. Still haven't had a practice yet. 

 
 On Dec. 14th, Dan and I took a trip to Fairmont and Banff with the rest of the LADS (Lon, Adam, Dan, Sean) and Adam's girl, Genelle and Joe and his girlfriend, Patricia. Sean has a cabin in Fairmont, so we stayed there and went to Panarama to ski/snowboard the next day. D and I have only had 3 lessons (at Snow Valley) prior to our trip, so I think we did pretty damn good on the mountains - especially since we did mostly blue runs. Dan was REALLY cranky that day (*Hi grumpybear!!!*)- but I'll spare you the details. That night, we all headed to Radium Hot Springs, which was totally what we all needed! Then we went to Banff and stayed the night there, walked around Banff in the morning and snowboarded at Lake Louise for 1/2 a day. Lake Louise's conditions were much better than Panarama's b/c the snow wasn't so slushy and the weather was a bit colder. Plus, Dan wasn't so grumpy. ;o)

  Some visuals: I apoligize for the BIGNESS of these pictures - I'll have to figure out how to resize pictures (I'm thinking I need a program to do this?) 

 
 
 

 
 

 
At Sean's cabin...the LADS themselves
  

 
Ok, Lon, this is a PARTY, why are you cleaning?! Anyhow, he's going to make a great hubby one day
 

 
 
Then on Dec. 17th, I went out with some of my friends to a university house party...in celebration of completing exams. Oh...how I miss school sometimes...but NOT the exams. The host was a girl named Hania, who I went to high school with (I only know her through my friend Suzy). There, I took some random pictures:

 
Drunk Twister...looks like fun! 
 

 
Mmmmm...doesn't the food look appetizing?! Susan thinks so! 
 
 
 
Dec. 20th - We all decided to go get shit faced at Jenn's then head over to Tonic, which was VERY very fun! Cheers!
 
 
Me and Dan, aww I like this one!
 

 
Me and my girls...Jenn, Michelle and Susan
 

 
And just for shits and giggles...I'll throw this one in here. When this picture was taken, I was feeling pretty *happy* and decided to take a pic of my ass b/c I think these jeans really compliment it...don't you? :oP
 
 
 
Dec. 21- Dan's Company Christmas Party! 
 
So this is what I would look like if i was a cartoon...interesting. I took this picture on the night of Dan's company christmas party. I think I was just killing time and wanted to play with some of the settings on my camera. 
 
 

 
Lon with his x'mas present from Dan, a THREE LITRE Heineken bottle...WOW. *sorry for the inconvenience of having to tilt your head to a 90 degree angle...still need to figure this one out too!*
 

 
The house that Genelle and Adam built...
 

 
...and the comments that it brought on...
 

 
I thought this was just hilarious...this is actually at D's banquet, and for entertainment, they decided to "rap" their speeches this year. Two cute old men looking and rappin' it like homies. 
 

 
Here's Dan and all the rookies of the company singing Jingle Bells...or attempting too anyway!

      You know what's funny? This is my third post, and Dan hasn't even seen the site yet! HA! Ok, but I just had to post b/c my soccer team kicked ass tonight!!! WHooOp! The score was 5-1. I scored 2 of those goals, well 3 if you count the second shot I took, which bounced off a teammate's back and into the net. I won't lie...our team isn't awesome, but we definetly don't suck --although our standings do. We're either in 6th or 7th place (probably 6th after tonight) out of 10 right now...so we're slooooowly moving on up. YAY! The problem is that we don't have a place to practice right now, since elementary schools won't let us practice at their locations and other possible locations are booked up. It also costs about ninety ridiculous dollars an hour to practice at a soccer center. We may have the possibility of practicing in Ardrawson (I KNOW I spelled that wrong, but I'm too lazy to go spellcheck) - so we're keeping our fingers crossed.

      [Roz's posting] I got a really funny forward in my email today to Nelly's website (LADS, you will enjoy this one!), directing me to play a game called "Slap that ass" - you guys have to try this one out for yourself! Just go to  urlLink  http://nelly.hypnosismedia.co.uk    and click on PLAY GAME then select the appropriate category ("Honeyz" if you are a girl  (DUH) and gentlemen, I'm sure you're smart enough to figure out your option). Bonus: It plays the "It's Getting Hot in Here" song! Whooo-Op! Knock yourselves out!

      Hey, it's Roz here (without Dan) - just testing this out. After months of delaying, I will FINALLY begin our digital journal for your entertainment and enjoyment. I bought myself a digital camera about four months ago and vowed to have a site put up with tons of interesting photos to envoke feelings of laughter, sadness, disgust, confusion or whatever emotion it may bring to you folks.  I have A TON of pictures waiting to be posted!! I'm dedicating this site as my- er--OUR, new hobby by geeking ourselves out for you folks. I know, I know, some of you are thinking, "What? Geeking yourself out? Don't you do that already?" I won't answer that one, I'll leave it up to the others to decide. ;o) I would end this post with a picture, however, I haven't exactly figured that part out yet, so for now, you'll just have to be satisfied with my emoticons.   :o/       :oP     :*(       :~D

      Ah, another disappointing day to bitch about. More stress at work...(which I don't want to get into) and tonight, played a pretty shit-ass soccer game. We played one of the worst teams tonight and LOST 2-1. I think alot of it had to do with b/c we were short-handed. Christina (one of the players in our power line) had to go into goal tonight since our regular goalie was absent. It was just even more disappointing to go from TYING with the best team to LOSING to the worst team. Like Dan said, we play like the Oilers (Remember how they LOST to Calgary and Nashville?!  Sick! ).  ONE more day until Friday night...oh, how I am counting the hours....

      [Roz] Ok, weird...I tried to edit the entry below b/c I see that the last picture doesn't download. Damn, it was of a cute puppy hugging a piece of grass, so that he looks like a pussywillow. AWWWW.  Anyhow, blogspot isn't giving me the option to edit the blog. Odd. Oh well. 
  
 Anyways, tobogganing was fun!!! It started to rain (freezing rain!) on my way to Dan's house and was STILL raining when I got there so we had all decided to cancel and just bum around in front of the TV and watch the Super Bowl. I don't understand much about football, but it's fun to go to live games and be part of the crowd anyways. People always doing crazy things and I LOVE the rowdiness!!! Fortunetly, the rain stopped about an hour later and the weather was absolutely fantastic for a night of tobogganing. Kelly brought her camera, so you'll have to go to her site,  urlLink  "Crazy White Girl with a Keyboard"   and check out the pictures under the Jan. 27th entry.  (Thanks Kelly!!!)  
 
 So it's about 2pm on a Tues afternoon, and I'm sitting here at home. I got the afternoon off work, which I totally needed because I JUST realized today that my job is TOTALLY stressing me out. I work with three kids, and one of them stresses me out alot b/c he can be difficult to deal with. Lately, he's been REALLY hard to deal with - grumpy mornings ALL the time and oppositional at school makes my job a challenge. I didn't think I did show signs of stress (I really try not to), but one of the teacher's and the kid's mom noticed that I talk faster and more when I am frustrated. Oops...I thought that was just me, seeing that I talk lots in general anyways. But when it was pointed out, I realized I WAS stressed out. ACK. So I am GLAD to have the afternoon off - going to go practice some karate and then watch Passions (soap), then probably take a nap. I have a meeting with my intern supervisor tonight, so it'll be good to talk to him about my stress. Damn, you'd think that working out 5 times a week would destress you enough...I guess not. *SIGH*
 
  On a good note, I am looking forward to the hockey game (U of A Bears vs. Calgary) at the university this Friday. Dan, I and friends will be going to RATT and Power Plant (bars on campus) before and after the game. If you're interested, let me know guys! Tix are only $4 if you're a student! Oh, I can't wait to go to Power plant! I miss it!!! I actually MISS school too!!!! (Not that I don't like my job).

        [Rozzy] Wow, this was a nice relaxing weekend (unfortunetly, not relaxing on a beach somewhere!). 
  Friday  night, Dan and I had a game of Scrabble and I beat his ass (finally I can beat him in SOMETHING). The scores were close though: 254 for me and 243 for Dan. Here's what we came up with:
 
 
 
 
 Saturday  night, went over to this girl Noelle's house (more like a mansion - they had their own gates and concrete walls surrounding the huge house) for Anahita's 24th birthday. It was a nice 'wine and dine' kind of party - there was a dinner, then afterwards, we all played a game of Pictionary - Guys vs. Girls. The girls led the whole game, but then the boys beat us in the last round. Dan and I actually went against each other in the second last round (coincidence), which was an "all play" round, where both teams must guess the word(s). ''Our word was "Swiss army knife". The girls got the "knife" part and then I tried to draw "cheese" (swiss cheese, get it?) but by then, the guys had already got the answer. GRRR! Losers had to serve the cake. 
 
 Another funny moment, was when I had to draw "Denver" but being very ignorant about America's geography, I had no idea where Denver was! So then I drew Canada with the US underneath it, so the girls knew it was in the States. Then for some odd reason, I drew a BEAVER, thinking maybe someone would get it (don't ask me how - but probably the "ver" part) and Anahita guessed it correct!!!  She thinks that beaver and Denver rhyme! What a smart girl, thinking on the same tracks as me (yes I know...odd thinking but hey -- it worked!) 
 
 
 Sunday  (today): I woke up from a really strange dream I had last night. Alot of what was in it were things that I discussed or seen last night at Noelle's house. The dream started out with D and I going to New York City for a vacation. He was telling me about how there is this rich old man (one of the richest in the world) who didn't have anything better to do with his time, so when he's in a pool, he dunks people and vomits on them. Sick.  (Side note: We were talking about people shitting in pools last night).  Anyways, when we get to New York, I'm suddenly younger  (Another side note: my dream jumps around ALOT).  and my brother is there with me. I'm about 12 years old, and we're at a "Singles Mom Dating Contest" so there were all these attractive older ladies surrounding us.  (I have NO idea why this part was in the dream).  Then the dream jumps to another scene, and we're sitting in a booth in a mall's food court with one of the "hot single moms", and she was deciding whether she should date this Greg guy, who had the most votes to go on a date with her. Merv (my brother) and I say "Go for it, he seems like a nice guy". 
  
Then the scene jumps again, and suddenly, I'm in an underground train station with a group of girls. I had to go pee, so one of the girls, Kristen  (who is an aquaintance that was at the party last night)  offered to bring me to the bathroom (which was in another building). We walked outside the busy streets of NYC and went into this back alley, where some 24 year old guy was making out with himself in his rear view mirror  (don't ask!) . We were laughing so hard that I wanted to go back for my camera, but we decided not to incase he had a gun. 
 
  Suddenly, the dream jumps to another scene and Dan and I are entering a room where there was a pool in it. I believe we were in a hotel in NYC. As we entered, I don't know why, but I went  around  the pool (which was a BIG detour) and Dan headed straight for the doors. As I was walking around the pool, I noticed a man who resembled Hue Hefner swimming, and 2 older ladies were busy flirting with him. All of a sudden, he dunked the 2 ladies and started to vomit on them IN the water!!! Dan yells, "That's the guy I told you about, Roz!!! Let's get out of here! QUICK!!!!" So the old dude turns around and vomits on a poor man swimming behind him and then he starts swimming towards me. I was panicking!!!! You know how you have such a hard time running in dreams, your feet feel like cement? It was kind of like that. And the old man attempts to vomit on me, but misses and it hits the ground in front of me! Eeeww! I was going to kick him in the head, but I was afraid he was going to pull me in and dunk him in the vomit-drenched water. I dashed to the door, after Dan, who was already on his way down a winding staircase  (which I saw at Noelle's house last night). 
There were other people running with us down the stairs...actually as I recall, we were  flying  - my hands were sweating like crazy as I held on to the rails and my feet were going as fast as they could. Someone yelled, "Becareful! I hear he likes to throw up down the staircase too!!!" And right before I knew it, he had vomited from the top of the staircase and some of it splashed into my hair.  Gross.  But that didn't stop me from running...the whole scene was a blur, all I could see where these white stairs and the outlines of people as I flew down the flight of stairs. As soon as we reached the bottom,  SPLAT  - he had managed to vomit ALL over the top of my head. I was so disgusted, I ran through this dark tunnel, where a line of women were waiting to use the bathroom. Everyone seemed to be aware of what happened, so they let me go ahead. As soon as I got into the bathroom, I saw that most of the puke had disappeared from my head, but I still wiped the remains. Then this older man comes up beside me, and I recognized him as Greg, the guy that single mom was suppose to go on a date with. He started making moves on me, and I was so revolted (as if I wasn't already!) I bolted out the door.
 
 
Next thing I know, I am in a room with Dan and telling him about how this Greg creep tried to touch me, and Dan tries to comfort me. We start to kiss passionately and...THEN I WAKE UP. What the hell, the best part of my dream is happening, and I have to wake up? Well, that's just my luck I guess! Isn't that such a f*cked up dream? I wonder what it meant?

 
  Back to reality: D and I were suppose to go snowboarding at Rabbit Hill today, but I read in the paper that it was going to be windy and there were going to be scattered showers, so we called it off. And whatdayaknow, it turned out to be a GORGEOUS day! But by the time I got out of my workout, it was already 2pm. Oh well, we're going tobogganning/tubing at Conner's Hill tonight! Whoohoo!  Anyone that reads this (in time) may come join the festivities! And I leave you with this sweet picture:

      d=I think it's pretty awesome when you can pay $2 for a soccer game (Roz's) and get more out of a professional hockey game (Oilers/Senators game) that costs 25 times more (well, free for me!!!).  Anyhow, at Roz's soccer game, they were playing the #1 team in their division, whom they had previously lost to 7 to 1.  After the first 5 minutes, Roz's team was down 3 to nil, and things didn't look too good.  They quickly rebounded and got a decent goal, then two penalty kicks got the game tied at the half.  To start off the 2nd half, they fell down 6 to 3 and we thought that the game was over.  They scored with about 15 then 10 minutes remaining, but had troubles controlling play for the majority of the remainder.  In the last minute, they sent out their #1 line (Teresa, Roz, and Christina - the power line) and Teresa brought the ball down to the offensive half, evaded some tackles, passed it through the crease, and Roz slammed home the tying goal with exactly 1.2 SECONDS remaining.  It totally rocked!  Amateur sport is equal or better than professional sport.  The only things that are missing are they hype and promotion.  Next weekend should be pretty fun as we'll be watching some U of A hockey, then taking a trip on memory lane, going drinkin' at the Plant, where we had MANY great and memorable nights.  later

      Ok, I'm going to do what everyone else is doing these days...bitch and complain about how cold it is right now!!!! Minus 31 today and I'm wondering why I should even bother getting out of bed (but then reality sinks in and guilt about not going to work starts taking over). Grrr. As some of you know, I am doing my internship working with autistic kids. One of my kids today asked if we were going to the park. "NO WAY!" was my response, and I didn't even give a second to think about that one! Earlier, he even wanted to greet his brother (who was being dropped off in front of the house by a yellow bus) by ATTEMPTING to run outside with just his sweatshirt and sweatpants on (socks too!) Lucky for my fast feet, I caught him in time. 
   Dan FINALLY got his snowboard in (after  only  THREE months!!!) so we are thinking about going to Rabbit Hill to ride this weekend. I heard that Saturday will be -15, and Sunday will be -7. I vote that we go on Sunday since it will be half as cold - I am a wuss when it comes to cold weather. My hands freeze in 2 degrees weather, for pete's sake!! 
   What are you doing these days to keep yourself busy?

      [Roz] Wow! I am  so  tired right now! Had some great nights both on Friday and Saturday. Friday, the LADS decided to break open the 3 litre bottle of Heinekin. Dan was already significantly sloshed since late afternoon with his co-workers (trade ya jobs, Dan!) Sean had his video camera and got some of the action on footage. I'll get Dan to add that in when he can. Oh, and we had 5 foosball games against each other and  I won three  of the games! YAY! (Yes, it did help that Dan was drunk but that's besides the point!) Anyway, on to the good stuff- pictures!! 
 
 
 Friday night 
 
 
WWE: Here's D biting poor Keith in the arm! Haha, look at Keith's expression!
 
 
The aftermath on Keith's arm
 
 
Check out the size of these cards - no wonder they are called  Drunk  cards!
 
 
Adam pouring Lon some Heinekin
 
 
 
 Saturday Night 
 
 
Friday night was Dan's drinking night, and Saturday night was mine. We went to the LADS residence to drink and then headed over to Roxy to dance. Note how pink (not quite red yet) I am. Man, I remember I thought I was talking, but I  know  I was yelling...and I didn't care! Sorry to those who had to suffer through the pain of listening to my silly ramblings. ;o)
 
 
 
 
We told Dan to smile "nicely" for the camera...here is his attempt. Nice try, Dan.
 
 
It took  four  attempts to take this picture with Lon (I couldn't centre our heads in the picture), but I finally did it!
 
 
Awww cute, Michelle and Byron (sorry about the blurriness!)
 
 
Terry, Michelle and me...wow, Michelle and I have our drunk expressions on!

      d=Just got back from Roz's soccer game and I can honestly say that I had more fun there than at the Oilers game this past weekend.  The soccer game ended up in a 2-2 tie, but it was full of everything...running goalies (on both teams), great plays, missed opportunities, and rowdy spectators (Quang and myself). There's definately something to be said for amateur sport over spoiled professionals.  On a side note, I never knew that Asian people can turn so red (ie. Roz's face was very tomato-like after the game)!!!

      Well since we're on the topic of death, I just rememebered a news story that I heard this morning. It's not so much related to death as it is to being a sick person in society. A young girl's parents and her grandmother tricked society into thinking that this poor girl was dying of lukemia so that they could collect funds from the charity they were promoting. It turns out that the whole thing was a hoax, and the girl is perfectly healthy. However, the parents and grandmother went as far as shaving the girl's head, giving her sleeping pills and putting her in counselling to prepare her for death. Now, if that's not traumatizing for a girl, I don't know what is. I wonder how this poor girl will turn out to be when she's older. Did anyone else hear about this?

      On a lighter note: As many of you know, I absolutely LOVE listening to the morning show on  urlLink  97.3 K-Rock  . Terry, Bill and Steve (the morning hosts) are hilarious and they always talk about interesting things (mainly, sex-related topics). Yesterday, they were talking about which cartoon character or super hero would you sleep with and tons of people called in. It was great! There were some funny answers. I just checked out the k-rock site and there's a link to cartoon porn. Click  urlLink  here   for a laugh (warning: "adult" site). It feels ironic to say that it's an adult site, although it features girls of Disney movies. I guess if I had to pick one, it would have to be either Neo from The Matrix (we all know how crazy I am about Keanu Reeves!) or Superman because then we could do it in mid-air. As for a cartoon character, I would have to say Eric from "The Little Mermaid". I HAD a crush on him WHEN (not since!) I was a little girl!  Also, maybe Tarzan...ok, I think I'm putting too much thought into this. Anyways, who would you pick and why?

      [Dan posting] So I was over at my sis's place yesterday for her birthday, and that got me thinking about my own mortality (?!?!?!?!?!).  When I die, I want it to be while doing something exciting (skydiving) or worthwhile (saving people from a burning building).  I think that once life gets to the stage where all you do all day is sit in a bed in a depressing old folk's home, life actually ends.  I'm not saying we die, but our life turns into mere existance.  I am totally pro-euthansia (sp?) and was just wondering what you guys thought of it.  I'm not depressed or worried about death or anything, but extremely interested.  Let us know what you guys think in the comments section.

      WOW! FINALLY Dan posts!!! YAY! Ok, ok...so Dan's beat me 30 times at foozball but I've still beat him 2 times. That's pretty good...right? C'mon, humor me and just agree with me, people!
  On another subject, today at karate, it was interesting. It was the first day of class for this semester and already, one of the yellow belts (second level) got his shoulder dislocated! It was a freak accident. I think he went to block a punch and BAM! It came out of the socket! I didn't see that (since I was sparring with another student). However, when I realized that he wasn't back in the dojo, I went outside of the gym to see what was going on (I can do that since I'm an instructor - ahh..the power!) He was losing feeling in his hand, so we called an ambulance. 
 I should have been back in the dojo helping the other Sensei teach, but this was MUCH more exciting. It's not like I get to see this everyday.  I REALLY wish I had my camera with me because at one point, the paramedic injected the IV needle into his arm and as he was doing that, he looked away to reach for something else. As soon as that happened, blood squirted everywhere!!! It was spewling all over his hand, the paramedic's hand and the carpet! Luckily, I was far away enough not to get sprayed. EWWW. The poor guy asked "Uh, was that suppose to happen!?" and the paramedic replied with embarassment,"Uh...no". Oops. He kept a very good sense of humor and asked for more morphine. Wow, not everyday I get to see something like this happen, especially at karate (not very many students get injured, due to strict control).

      WOW!!!  Here I am (finally).  Thanks to all of those who are visiting our site and leaving comments on our site (I guess we can now officially call it OUR site).  
BTW, Just to set the record straight, I'll keep a running tally of our Fooseball games.  So far, the record is about 2 wins for Roz and 30 for Dan.  Not trying to brag or anything, but just making sure the people understand the situation at hand.  
Remember to come back often...more to come soon!

      Hmmm, what's up since I've written last? Here's a brief summary:
 
  *THURSDAY: My soccer team got whooped by the Warriors (an elite soccer team, which I use to play for back when I was in gr. 6). The Warriors stand second (out of 10) and we're something like place eight. Although I'm sure we're probably ninth now. OUCH! I have to admit though, we didn't play that bad, the score was ONLY 5-1...we were expecting 10-zip...but the Warriors weren't as good as we expected them to be. Our goal was not to win, but to at least score one goal. We did just that! yay! The highlight of the night (I think), besides our one goal of course, was when I executed a "slide-and-tackle" on this one girl and she just went FACE diving into the turf!I was SO sure that I was going to get called on that one, but NOPE- the ref ordered for us to "keep playing".  That was because I didn't touch her...she tripped over me! HA! (Lon, I think you would have LOVED to see that one!) 
  
  *FRIDAY: Dan and I went with Joe and Patricia to The Attic, which was pretty dead and just playing lame music, so we headed over to Suite 69 and stayed there for a bit. There were these 3 older ladies there (around a mom's age) who were just having a hoot dancing away. (Sorry, I didn't have my camera with me!) They weren't dressed provocative...they were dressed...well...like moms. Joe asks us if we think they are considered "cougers" and I say no, because they didn't look like they were there to pounce on young horny "boys"...just a couple of moms trying to relive their youthfulness.  Anyhow, I can see myself at that age doing the same thing...any of you ladies wanna join me in 20 years? 
 
 
  * SATURDAY: Dan, George, Janelle and I went to see the hockey game, Oilers vs. Senators. Ohmygod, that was the WORST game I've seen the Oilers play (I'm sure Dan will have more to bitch about on this--if he ever writes on here!) It was such a messy, disorganized game. The Oilers looked like they were trying to fluke plays instead of setting up some. Needless to say, we were very disappointed. The score was 2-0. Did anyone else see the game? 
  After the game, the four of us headed over to The Armoury Nightclub for  Amy's birthday. I've never been to the Armoury before (it's where the old Club Malibu use to be) - and I remember I tried to get into the club last summer but they wouldn't let me because I was wearing runners. Hmm, maybe if I had the cleavage it wouldn't have mattered. Oh well. Anyhow, I was expecting it to be a posh place where everyone dresses in black and look the same. To my surprise, it wasn't that bad. The downstairs was way better than the upstairs - music-wise.  Amy had her party mostly upstairs, where they were playing retro hits. She had everyone dress up in 70's gear. Her get up was hilarious...again, sorry I didn't have my camera! She wore these HUGE pin/purple shades, a silver tube top, tight pants that hitched up her torso with gold chains in the front of it and socks OVER her pants. It was great! She had us all wear nametags, and I had mine as "R-licious" and I made Janelle get hers as "J-licious". George was "Sexy Machine" and Dan was "DHC Hardcore". I think the highlight of the night was when Janelle got hit on by this dirty (older) guy. He was saying that it was his friend's bday and that he was watching her and wanting her all night. UGH. Poor Janelle. He basically treated her like a prostitute by trying to convince her that his friend had a huge dick, etc. Poor, poor Janelle. But we thought it was funny! hehe!
 
 *When D and I got back to his place, we had a few games of foozball- AND I WON one game! YAY for Roz! Actually the game was quite intense, b/c I was SO mad since he beat me 10-0 the game before (ya I know, I suck). I was up about 2 or 3 points in this game, and then D caught up and then I would score, then he would score, then I would score and he would score...it kept going like that...until I won the final point. I guess being mad helped alot. Thanks Dan for pissing me off. :o)

      Ok, this happened on the Feb. 14th weekend, but I just managed to clean up some account space to post this picture up. 
 
  
 
 This might seem morbid of me to take such a picture, but this kind of stuff doesn't happen all the time, so I  had  to photograph it! This is a picture of the front of Barry's truck. (He's is in my karate class). When I went to karate that Friday, his truck was filled with dead birds. He said he was driving down a road and all these birds that were hanging out on the side of the road had decided to fly towards his truck (does this seem like a bad omen?) and  Whap, whap, whap!!!  - instantly, at least half (50) birds were killed. One bird even had it's beak stuck in the windshield (it was beak to nose with Barry), so he had to turn on his wipers to knock the bird off! There's a small hole in the windshield left. Crazy eh?

      [Roz] Busy weekend! The LADS were moving all weekend into a bigger house a few blocks away.  So on Friday night, Dan and Sean drank, and boy, was Dan wasted! He ended up vomitting later. There's also some interesting footage on Sean's video camera of Dan doing some crazy stunt. I'll get him to post the details. Saturday was moving day, so the boys moved the "little things" (i.e., everything but furniture). I got to see the house for the first time too. When you walk in, the entrace walls are bright yellow...and I mean BRIGHT. The living room is painted a super bold orange. The kitchen walls are this lime-yellow color. I'm not sure what to think - the walls are this crazy color and it just doesn't seem to suit the old, house - where most of the other walls are cedar panels. It just doesn't seem to go. 
 
 Saturday night was girls night out! Whoohoo! Michelle, Terry, Jackie, Susan, Joanne and I went to Yuk Yuk's. The show was awesome - all the comedians were super funny. I just about cried laughing so hard when the Headliner, Chris something (sorry, forgot his name - girls, can you help me out?) performed. He was making fun of teenage boys. Afterwards, we went to The Joint Nightclub, where we got drinks for $2 all night. Being a cheap drunk, I don't think I've spent more than $10-15 at a bar. Last night, I spent $25-30 on vodka slime hiballs. I didn't realize how drunk I was until we were on our way home, and I was sitting in the backseat of Susan's car. My head was throbbing and my stomach was churning. It was such a nauseating feeling. This usually doesn't happen when I drink b/c I don't drink enough to feel the pain, since I'm usually good after 2 Smirnoff Ices. 
 
 So Susan pulled over to let me hurl, but I couldn't force myself to. The whole way home, I held a plastic IGA bag under my head,  trying  to vomit. It wasn't until I got to my front doorsteps, did I managed to vomit. I had to practically lean all the way down to my knees (standing up) to make myself vomit. But man, did I feel  soooooooooooo  much better after. :o) Ugh, that was my very first time vomitting from drinking. However, I didn't feel too bad this morning (thank god!) NO HANGOVER!

      [Roz-of course!] Yay! We won our soccer game tonight - but it was against the last place team in our league. And I'm not happy to announce that we've slid down to 2nd last place. Tonight, I think that we played good, but not awesome. We have done WAY better (i.e., TIED the first place team a few weeks ago) -and we had so many opportunities tonight, but we were playing messy. The final score was 4-3 (too close!!!), so we beat them, but didn't kick their ass. I scored the first goal - yay for me! 
 
 I'm going to be doing some catching up (very slowly) from last week. Man, it seems that that's all I am doing on this website - catching up! But I guess, better late than never, right? ;o)
 
  Thursday, Feb. 13 
 
 Dan and I celebrated Valentine's Day early, and went to a Thai restaurant on Whyte called "The King and I". I always think it's a dinner theatre (doesn't it sound like one!?). The food there is amazing, exotic and different. I loved it! I definetly recommend going there if you're looking for a nice, snazzy dinner.  After dinner, we went to  urlLink Sam Roberts  concert at Red's. It was a pretty good rock show! I think Sam Roberts is super cute too - and call me insane, but I think him and Keanu Reeves resemble each other a little bit. I figure it's the lips - they look identical, don't they!? You be the judge:
 
  
  
 
 Bad picture of Keanu, but it was the closest one I could find at a similar angle and clear enough to see that their lips match. Too much time on my hands? Maybe. (Actually, that's not true). 
 
  Friday, Feb. 14 
 
 I went out with some friends to The Druid, a pub/bar I really like but don't go often (b/c it's inconveninently out of the way- downtown).  I had an awesome night. There was some "Valentine's Hook-Up" game going on, where (single) people wear a label with a number on it. Then if someone is interested in that person, they can write them a note and leave in the corresponding mailbox. Kinda cute, but I don't know how successful it was, since I didn't see anyone take notice of other people's digits. 
 
 Oh, and  *gasp* , the unimaginable happened...my beloved baby #2 (my camera, of course) flew out of my hands and landed in another dance group, under some dude's legs. Without thinking, I literally dived for it, knocking over whoever was in my way. Don't worry guys, my camera is a-ok though!  Whew!  And here are some pictures from that night:
 
 Michelle and I
  
 
 This is Danny, who I happened to bump into and his friend from Calgary, Scott. Danny was pretty *happy* that night!
  
 
 Me, Miche, and Jo (see, she just can't keep her eyes opened at all!)
  
 
 Dan, Byron, Jackie and Michelle
  

 *Ok, running out of room on my shaw account, so I'll have to figure stuff out to post more pix*

      [Roz] Ok, so I FINALLY have a chance to catch up on our week:
 
  Friday night 
 
 The night of my soccer team's fundraiser...and I sold ONE ticket...to Dan. Ok, well two if I count myself. Whoohoo! All you guys in school studying for midterms...well let me tell you something...you missed out on  alot  of fun! Ok... who am I kidding? It was a pretty bad night (not bad in the sense like  last  Friday night) but bad in that it was held at Cowboys, which  use   to be my favorite club but now is just a place for bad bad country music and eighties songs. Regardless, I had somewhat of a good time, but I know Dan didn't really enjoy himself since he can't stand country music. Awww, poor baby. 
 
 So to keep myself entertained, I went around taking pictures of interesting things....
 
 This is the  ugliest  leopard suit I've ever seen...and it even had shoulder pads!!!  I went around Cowboy's just to find this girl and take a pic to show you all just how bad this suit was! There was this guy sitting by her and he was beaming from ear to ear b/c he thought I was taking a picture of him! Ha ha! Hey single ladies, this technique is a good way to pick up men! 
  
 
 There was actually a WIZARD there to read your palms! Oh my god, how desperate is Cowboy's becoming?
  
 
 I was trying to take a picture of this muscle-head guy with a bubble butt (no he wasn't good looking) but this girl got in the way of the picture and she wasn't sure what she should do, so she kept hesitating to move and here's the final picture: She looks terrified! 
  
 
  There was also one more interesting thing that I saw...this girl had the worst hair I've ever seen - well besides a  urlLink  femme mullet  . She had a thick mop of bleach bottle blond layers on top, then brown layers underneath that were significantly longer - and then on TOP of that, she had long strands of hair spread out around her head, and they were at least 3 inches longer than any of her other hair. These strands of hair were bleached blond as well. It was so disgusting. I went around Cowboy's at least 3 times just to find her, but at last, no luck. Sorry folks!
 
 Here's some pictures of the girls on my team:
 
 Me, Rhiannon, Janine and Bev, our die-hard cheerleader who comes to all the games!
  
 
 Rachel and Theresa feeling pretty happy that night -- Girls, you're lucky I didn't have my camera on the dance floor! ;o)
  
 
 Cheryl and me
  
 
 Jackie, me and Nicole
  
 
 I think this was Dan's highlight of the night (besides me, right Dan?) *wink*
  
 
  Here's Freddie, our soccer coach (left) with Clayton, Jackie's boyfriend. 
  
 
  Saturday Night Bowling 
 
 Jackie celebrated her 22nd birthday by having a bowling party! We had fun! I think the pictures say it all!
  
 
 For her bday, we decided to get implants....
  
 
 ...and so did Byron. Dan and Joanne copping a feel.
  
 
 Here's the first game scores... LOOK! I kicked Dan's ass!  (Dan is "H" for Haggis and I'm "G" for Giggles- one of our nicknames). Not that my game was great anyhow...but I beat him and that's all that matters! Hee hee. Also, the machine screwed up, so my score should actually be higher! Grrr.
  
 
 And Dan made me post the second game scores up...and he came back with a vengence. I have one thing to say...the first practice ball I got was a STRIKE...and of course I don't get any in the games. Grrr. 
  
 
 George, Byron, Dan and Quang carrying their Queen ;o)
  
 
 Judging by Michelle's smile, it looks like she just knocked all the pins down!
  
 
 And judging by Dan's face (and seeing that the ball's going towards the gutter!), Dan didn't do so good here!
  
 
 George and Dan
  
 
 We tried to take this picture twice b/c Joanne kept blinking...no luck! She blinked again anyways! L to R: Michelle, Mary, Me and Jo. 
  
 
 Jo couldn't even keep her eyes opened in this one with Freddie either!!

        The Funeral 
 
 My grandpa's funeral was held in a funeral chapel downtown. It was a small party of people - my parents, brother, Uncle John, Aunt Christine, Margaret (grandpa's wife), her son Eric and some close family friends of grandpa. Dad and Uncle John were wearing black sashes tied around their left arms. Is this just a tradition in my culture or do other cultures do this too?  As the funeral director lead us all into the chapel,  I saw my grandpa lying there in the open casket, looking like he was sleeping peacefully. It really didn't hit me until that moment to realize that he was really gone. Immediately I started to cry. Over the next half hour, we took turns bowing 3 times to grandpa, then talking to him alone. I talked to him for a good five minutes and just poured my heart out to him. I cried, I smiled and I remembered sweet memories with him.  
 
 A Priest came and spoke to us read us some prayers (in English since they couldn't find a Chinese priest), then lead us (and grandpa) to the crematorium - where we would see grandpa for the last time. Everyone kneeled down and we cried furiously. Dad and Uncle John turned on the crematory and it was a really intense moment of all our lives. We all headed back to the chapel, where we thanked the friends that came. Later, the funeral director handed us each a white envelope with 2 Chinese characters written on it. I don't know exactly what it said, but one character said "Lucky". Inside, was a coin (mine was 25 cents) and a candy. We were to eat the candy, keep the coin and use it only for candy or lotto ticket, and throw the envelope away. It would be bad luck to keep it (a superstition for our culture). I tried to ask why it was considered bad luck and what kind of things would happen, but no one seemed to have an answer. 
 
 We left shortly afterwards to a Chinese restaurant downtown, where we ate mostly vegetarian plates. They talked about the good ol' times with grandpa (my brother and I mostly listened since we can't speak Chinese that well). Then Margaret took out some souvineers for us to keep of grandpa. There were 3 watches he had worn sometime in his life, and dad took one of them. Grandpa had bought my brother and I jade pendants many, many years ago and he meant to give it to us, but never did b/c he found out from his goldsmith friend that it was not  real  jade. Since it wasn't real, grandpa feared that the lead (in the jade pendant) would not be too healthy for us (since it would rub against our skin). My pendant is really cool - it is long and looks like there is a picture of a chinese fortune wheel at the bottom of it. Mervyn's was cool too - it's a plain round circle with a hole in the middle. 
 
  This was my first funeral I've attended so I don't have any other experiences to compare it to. Although it is probably obvious which parts of the funeral originate from my culture, I'd like to know if there are any other significant differences compared to a Canadian funeral, if anyone is willing to comment. 
 
   Rest in peace, Grandpa

      [R] I know that some of you want to know how my grandpa's funeral went, and I promise when I have a bit more time, I'll fill ya in (it'll be a long one!). It's 12:15AM, and I just got home from my soccer game about 45 min. ago. I am writing b/c I have to  VENT   out my anger and frustration about my soccer team - mainly, to those players who don't show up to games. Our team doesn't suck...we  seem  to suck b/c no one shows up for the games, so we get tired and we lose. That's exactly what happened tonight. We had 9 players (10 including the goalie) and the other team had at least 15-20, which is plenty of subs. The other team  sucked . They are in 2nd last place (I just found out today we're actually in 6th place) and they have no shots, no plays, no aggressive players (ok, they are a bit pushy). It was just a pathetic game over all. We were leading 2-0 first half and then they came back with some goals (we were tired!) and I managed to get a goal by charging at the goalie and the ball bounced off my shin. Fluke shot totally. I wasn't even happy about it b/c I was too tired to be. So I'm bitching about those people who pay JUST as much as we do and don't come out to the games. It's not fair to the team and not fair to themselves!  Grrr. We should have won this game. If we can tie the first place game (and that was due to having 15 players on our team, which proves my point!), then we could very well be at the top of the placings, but of course only a few of us are dedicated. On that note, I won't be going to next game b/c D and I are going to see  urlLink  Sam Roberts   in concert! Yay!  I actually had to debate whether I should miss the game or not though! 
 
 And on a happy note, I get to go to a Tobogganing Party with a Kindergarten class tomorrow with one of my lil' kids! Yay! What a good way to end a semi-stressful week!  :o)

      3d=well, at the end of the month we (the LADS - Lon, Adam, Dan, Sean) will be moving into a new house.  Much bigger, a little newer, 2 full bathrooms, a basement above the freezing mark, and (most importantly in my opinion) a FIREPIT!!!  I've always wanted one and I think it'll be great in the summer just to sit around on a warm summer night, roast some marshmellows, and chill out.  We'll be having a party sometime when the snow is gone, and it's warm enough to wear shorts outside.  I can't wait.

      And for anyone else who cares...HA!!!! I TOTALLY  knew   urlLink it  !!!  I *hate* the whole J.Lo and Ben Affleck idea - I totally thought they got together for publicity's sake from the beginning. They don't even seem to *match* or click when I look at them together. Not that I care much about Hollywood life (except for Keanu Reeves' of course!) but Jennifer Lopez (I HATE the name J.Lo too!) and Ben Affeck together annoy me for some reason. Everytime someone mentions them together, I just have to roll my eyes and think,  Good God, they are just together b/c Hollywood thinks they should be.  You get one good looking top-of-the-females-star person, and then a good looking top-of-the-males-star person and  BAM  - a manufactured couple. How genunine is that? How  convenient   is that for their status? Grrrrr. I give them 3 more months. Just read about how pathetic Affleck is over her (i.e., $3000 worth of roses to make up for their fight-what a WASTE of money)! Makes me sick, especially since this money can go to charity. Oh, and if he cheats on her? She gets $1 million dollars. Whatever happened to being down to earth,  Jenny from the Block ?

      I woke up about 45 minutes ago (10AM) and went downstairs to ask my parents when we would go visit grandpa. We didn't end up going last night b/c dad phoned after seeing him at the hospital last night and said he was fine and sleeping. He said he was okay and that since he was new at the hospital, they didn't understand grandpa that much yet. So maybe they over-reacted a bit to my grandpa's illness. This morning, before I even got a chance to ask my parents, my mom releases the news that grandpa has passed at 3AM. 
  "You mean he's not alive anymore?" I asked stupidly, shocked but yet relieved at the same time. "Are you and dad okay?" I glanced at my dad who was reading the morning paper. My parents nodded, they didn't seem too sad.  I know they are relieved that he is in a better place and not suffering anymore as well. 
 
 Thoughts raced through my mind as I went to sit down at the dining room table, across from dad.  "Dad, I hate to say this and it'll sound mean, but in a way, I'm glad that grandpa has died b/c he is not in pain anymore," I said as tears started rolling down my face. Dad agreed. 
 
"Are you sad?" 
 And dad just sincerely said, "It's a cycle of life, and it was his time. He is in a better place now". 
 I nodded. Then streams of tears ran down my face furiously as I managed to tell my parents that I had prayed to God last night to ask grandpa to be at peace, whichever way that would be...him either getting better or him moving on to the next stage.  My parents are athiests, but they have enrolled my brother and I in Catholic schools our whole life. I don't know if my brother believes in God, and I don't even know if I REALLY did until today. I have always believed that he did exist somehow, someway and somewhere despite all the skeptism about how he came about. But after praying and talking to Him last night, I feel like he really did listen to me and answered my prayers. 
 
 
My dad and I discussed about how grandpa had a depressing last 10 years. Not to get into too much details about my family history, but about 12 years ago, my grandpa went back to Hong Kong for a few months and came home...married with a new bride. This would be either his 3rd or 4th marriage. Apparently, we discovered the truth about her when her and my grandpa had an argument one night. It was so intense that it  caused  him to have a stroke. As months and years unfolded, we learned that she really married him so that she could get Canadian citizenship to be with her 3 (grown-up) sons, who lived in Vancouver with her ex-husband. Later, they moved in with her and grandpa here in Edmonton. She's always been very greedy with grandpa's money, and he wasn't even rich. She has been collecting cheques from my Aunt and Uncle (who is my dad's brother and grandpa's son) from Ontario for herself, instead of putting it towards health insurance for my grandpa. Needless to say, we don't think much of her as she is a very cruel hearted woman (or should I say monster?). 
 
  The hospital called her first yesterday to tell them that grandpa was severely ill and she didn't want to go see him. She said she would go on Sunday (today). Still sitting at the table with dad, I wondered outloud if she felt guilty and dad says that she probably does. "But I don't know dad, she doesn't have a conscience, it seems".  I don't care if she feels guilty or not, but if she does, I'm sure she is punished by it. My Uncle John from Ontario is coming tomorrow morning to discuss funeral plans with dad and grandpa's wife. 
 
  I've never been to a funeral before. The only time I've seen dead people was last year when my sociology course called  Death and Dying  went to a morgue. However, these people were covered in white sheets so I couldn't see them really. My mom just came into the room and told me for the funeral to either dress in all black or all white. " All white ? Is that the Chinese tradition?" Mom nodded and said, "Yes, and also it's an insult to wear all white at a Chinese wedding for that reason".   Interesting .  
 
 
What's more interesting was that I had a dream about death last night too. I dreamed that some sort of high profile secret agency wanted me dead (not sure why) so I had to pretend to be dead. Many people in my dream helped me out by covering for me while I tried to escape the city (?) or whatever place I was in. I had to stay at their places over night and during the day I would travel to my next destination. I don't remember if I had to dress myself in diguises or not, but it seems to be a faint memory that I did. At one point in the dream, I remember that one of the agency guys caught me and was checking to make sure I was dead. I remember him being skeptical and saying to people who were helping me out, "If she's really dead, she will be able to do  this "...whatever  this  was. So I remember that I was being SO obvious, I was totally breathing and getting ready for him to do whatever he was going to do (and I was expecting the worst). Somehow, I passed the test and he left. That's all I remember.

      Roz] After so much looking forward to last night, it ended with a big disappointment (seems to be a constant  factor in my life this week). It started out quite awesome, with me already lightheaded at 6pm from drinking many shots of Armeretto (ha ha). D and I bused it to the university and snuck past the ushers (we didn't have tickets) - and it was funny b/c it wasn't like we tried. We were looking for Kelly, who had our tickets and ended up walking into the arena. The game started out slow, but quickly picked up. I really enjoyed my first time watching the U of A Bears Hockey team. We kicked their ass, 5-2. There were alot of little kids there, which surprised me b/c I expected more students than there was. The other Sensei today asked me if the crowd was still as crazy when he went 20 years ago. He said that the students would have garbage can lids and serving trays and they would bang it against the rink windows and cheer that way. Pure rowdiness. Sounds like pure fun, but it was pretty calm last night. The only so-called "crazy" thing I saw was a dude dressed in a white scrub suit wearing a boat shaped hat made from newspaper trying to start the wave with the crowd. I wonder if there was an order to limit the rowdiness over the years? Anyone know? 
 
 
Then, Adam, Lon, Janelle, Dan and I headed over to the Powerplant (campus bar), which is usually packed on Friday nights. Well...things have changed! It was sooo dead. I haven't partied there since my first year I think (3 years ago), and it was crazy crowded back then. Janelle and I danced on the stage (which is the dance floor) and some guy tried coming to dance with us, so we turned our backs to him and started dancing with THE WALL! It was hilarious. And this happened TWICE. You would think he would take a hint after the first time he got dissed. I couldn't stop laughing at Janelle b/c she was making it so obvious!  (Janelle, we're so mean!) 
 
 
A few drinks later, everyone (but me) were feeling pretty good, if you know what I mean. I had to drive home, so I didn't drink after the game. Anyways, an incident happened and it affected the whole group, which snowballed into bigger issues for all 5 of us. Because it was a personal incident, I won't go into details. Like any other couple, Dan and I got into an argument/fight, and things snowballed for us too. By the end of the night, we both were feeling pretty awkward. I would have never predicted the night to end the way it did. It was one big f*cked up night. Everything is back to normal now though (I think) and I pray that this coming week will not be as stressful. 
 
 
I just find it ironic that I look forward to the weekend so that I could take a break from work-stress, and it starts off on a  BANG  (but not the party-kind-of- bang ) of  more  disappointment. I suppose that that's life and I shouldn't bitch about it, but hey, that's what I have this website for! It's life, it's reality, so shit like this is bound to happen sometimes. I accept that. 
 
 
On another sad subject, I'm going to go see my grandpa tonight at the General Hospital. He's  extremely  ill and I don't know how much longer he has to live. He suffered a stroke back when I was in gr. 6, and he lost most of his vision when he came out of it. I never saw my grandpa again....He use to be the happiest man, full of energy and laughter - and after the stroke, he wasn't the same man. It was really hard to accept and see him depressed and lifeless. Over the years, grandpa's health has been deteriating. I am guilty of giving him a  social  death. I haven't gone to visit him much over the years b/c I can't stand the pain of seeing him so unhappy. It's uncomfortable, it's horribly uncomfortable. I don't even know if he knows who I am anymore - or that if he remembers I exist. His mind is going too. I haven't prayed to God in a long while, but I sent him a prayer tonight for my grandpa to please put him in peace, however way that will be.

       Saturday  
  *  Dan got quite the shiner at ball hockey practice, when the ball hit him there. 
 Here's DAY ONE of his poor eye. 
  
 
  *  Joe and Patricia hosted a pot luck dinner at Patricia's house. I was going to make maccoroni salad but didn't have all the ingredients, so I got lazy and made macorroni and cheese. When I told Dan what I made, he laughed and said  "Mac 'n cheese? Isn't that kinda...white trash-ish?"  Oh yeah...I didn't think about that...so we put some cheese on top of the maccoroni and baked it. Turned out pretty damn good! 
 
 The dinner party itself was nice and simple. We played sociables (even though 1/2 of us weren't drinking) with these cards: 
  
 Where in the world can you get cards like that? At one point, one of the rules was that Sean and Joe had to re-enact the pictures on those cards (I promised I wouldn't take pictures of that). 
 
 Then at one point, Patricia made another rule where there was  no talking .  So for the next 20 minutes, everyone just made gestures with grunts, moans and retarded sounds. It was pretty amusing, especially when it came to  storytime  (which is when each person says one word, but must repeat all the words said before their turn). 
 
 Here's Joe, Pat and Sean (probably pre- no talking  rule). 
  
 
 Katie and Carlos

      [Roz] Friday night turned out to be pretty boring at Scruffy Murphy's because it was pretty dead - ok...no, let me rephrase that- it was  really  dead. I went on my own since Dan had a night out with his business buddies. Not even half the soccer team showed up either (not when I was there anyways). Luckily, Freddie's female co-workers, Angie, Michelle and Jen wanted to drag him out to The Roost (a gay bar downtown) and rip it up there. I decided to tag along since it would definetly make for an interesting night. I've never been to The Roost, or any gay bar for that matter. I called up D to see what he was up to and it was good timing because he was just getting out from The Druid downtown.  I asked if he wanted to come along and he said sure. He knew it was a gay bar, but I had failed to tell him that they play hardcore 80's music (since he can't stand it) - tee hee...oops! 
 
  At The Roost, the atmosphere screamed sex (more so than at other bars)- the sexual paintings (you'll know what I mean once you see the pictures), the sex toys on display at the entrance, and not to mention, the sexual tension between gay couples. Downstairs was where most of the gay couples hung out, dancing to the 80's music. Upstairs was a place reserved for college kids to hang out and play pool, or dance to Top 40 dance shit. Here's some pictures from upstairs:
 
 See what I mean when I say it screams out sex!?
  
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 Freddie styling Ang, Jen and Michelle - or is it the other way around?
  
 
  Just playing along....
  
 
 The Big Eye
  
 
 Believe it or not, Freddie's not even drunk here...I know, hard to believe!
  
 
 This picture's funny...it's not very clear, but the girl on the left's got glow in the dark nails and they were SO LONG!  See the white glow from her left hand?  I was going to take a picture of her, but then hesitated because I was scared she would come scratch my eyes out with those weapons, so Dan took it. The girl realized and she posed for the camera after - (but it was too late, this picture was taken already). 
 
  
  Dan had so much energy, quote  "I'm so hyper!"  due to consuming alcohol earlier with his work friends - he even shocked me by dragging me back downstairs to dance to 80's music. Freddie had a good laugh because he's never seen Dan so enthusiastic to dance. It was awesome. Of course D had fun gawking at some hot lesbian girls making out on the dance floor (maybe that's why he wanted to go back downstairs)!  They also had a female stripper perform for the crowd. I had heard that The Roost had male strippers who go full monty - but never heard about any female strippers performing there, so that surprised me too. It was different to see girls go crazy over a female stripper - different experience to see. 
 
 So Friday night turned out to be quite different than I expected, but both Dan and I had lots of fun!

OH yeah, and just a reminder, my soccer team will be having a wrap-up party at Scruffy Murphy's tomorrow night (Friday, March 28) at 9pm, so hope to see you folks there!

      [Rozzy] So last night, I went to a  sex party   that my friend Joanne invited me to. It's like those candle or tupperware parties that women hold, only with toys and more excitement. This was my first time going to one. The party was held at Joanne's coworker's house - so there were about 15 ladies there. So what happens, for those of you who have never been to one either, is that a lady from the company (in this case, it was "Spice It Up Novelties") comes to the house and presents products to us. There was alot of interesting things- from love lotions, body paint, lingerie, to kinky sex toys. I never knew half of those toys existed or worked before last night (ok, maybe less than half). 
 
 One of the most  interesting  toys worth mentioning was this pink penis-shaped toy, and the lady got us to stick our fingers in it (after she put a bit of lube in there) and it felt just like a real woman's  love spot . Although it was a bit weird to feel a prosthetic vagina, all of us were so amused by the realness of this toy,  it was like we didn't want to touch it again, but at the same time, we  did  want to touch it again (but we didn't do it). There was also these silver balls, about the size of marbles, and  what you do is put them inside yourself and just walk around while they freely  hang around  in  there .  My first reaction was shock- I didn't even know these kind of things exist. My second reaction -  could they get lost up there?  Yikes, the lady said you can even have intercourse while they are up there! Now, that's intense!  *cringe* 
 
  We really enjoyed the vibrators -  not in that way, people!  We had fun playing with the speeds of them. Some of them had crazy features (e.g., beads inside the vibrator that rotate, clitoris stimulators) and the speed that some of them could max to was intense (literally)!  All I could picture was a rocket blasting off to space as I looked at them (with wide eyes).  
 
  Since Joanne co-hosted the party, her and the other hostess both received some goodies, including this "Nipple Creme" - which obviously goes on your nipple and if you blow on it, it gets hotter (literally) and then starts to feel tingly and a bit numb. All of us girls tried a bit of it. One girl was so funny, she was just talking and then all of a sudden, she paused and out of the blue said, "WHOA! I am TOTALLY feeling it right now!" It was hilarious because she didn't expect it. 
 
  So it was quite the party and sorry folks, I didn't think it was really appropriate to bring my baby (the camera!) along, so you'll just have to use your imagination. *Wink*

      [Roz] YAY! I got a haircut today! I absolutely  love  getting my hair snipped - it makes me feel like an anxious and excited 5 year old girl in a candy store, as my anticipation for the haircut appointment builds. I just get really sick of my hair so when I think about getting my hair cut, I get pumped about how it's going to look. I'm sure girls reading this can relate.
  So after trying to grow out my hair for about 9 months, I finally couldn't handle the plainess of my hair anymore. I realized that I finally got to the point that I'm wearing it alot in boring ponytails lately. So I got my hair cut to look like Meg Ryan's - choppy and shaggy- how I usually like it.  I probably got a good 2-3 inches off too. My mom and dad said they couldn't tell though - but I think that's probably b/c they don't see me enough. I think it's significantly different. I guess you guys will have to judge from the next batch of photos.

      [Rozzy] The LADS house party was a huge success - I would have to say it was probably their best party yet. Part of the fun was that we didn't even know half the people that came - they were friends of friends (of friends). Add a thriving foozball tournament, plus an awesome live DJ (thanks Henry!), plus a firepit in the backyard and mix 30-40 people into the ingredients equals Saturday night.  (Note to Adam and Lon: Sorry boys, I meant to have pictures of you both, but my camera died on me!) 
 
 "Greetings!"
  
 
  Greetings!  We were playing "Sociables" and this was the  Power  rule
  
 
 But Sean and Dan had their own idea of the same  power  move...
  
 
 Hmm, I wonder if Chris remembers this "glorious" moment- surrounded by hot women! 
  
 
 Foozball team Dan and Jenelle did very well - they made it into the Round Robin, but lost that game
  
 
 Here are the foozball champs (Nano and Travis) -I think they won about $16 each. By the way, I have no idea who these guys are! 
  
 
 Me and Kelly
  
 
 Henry ripping up the tunes - I think the yellow wall looks awesome as a background!
  
 
 Charlie's Angels- WOW, Joanne, your eyes are actually opened this time!

      [Roz] Ok, only if you're Chinese, will you appreciate and understand what I mean when I say that my parents are pack rats!!!! I know you know what I'm talking about, all you people who have Chinese parents that feel they cannot throw anything out and have to treasure every single piece of useless thing they own.
  I have two confessions: One, I listen to that damn teeny-bop Power 92 radio station (except for in the mornings b/c I CANNOT stand those annoying deejays) and two, what I am about to show you may leave you thinking that my family and I are just messy, lazy slobs (which isn't true) who don't know how to interior design our house (which is true). As some of you may have heard, Power 92 is having a contest for the  urlLink "Ugliest Room in the House" . Check out the other rooms, I think that they are no competition for my house! The grand prize winner gets Hilda, from Trading Spaces, to come and redecorate that ugly room. So maybe it is finally a chance to celebrate the ugliness of my house, it honestly looks like we just moved in (but we've been in this house for about 15 years): 
 
  Please post your comments and opinions about which room I should send into the contest. 
 
 This is the family room, or is suppose to be anyways. 
  
 
 This is the den beside the family room - well, it  use  to be a den but it's more like a place for storage now.
  
 
 This is my parents' bedroom (sorry mom and dad - I just had to). But I'm sure they will be thanking me if they win! 
  
 
 And no, this isn't our garage, believe it or not...it's our basement! It's fully developed too...but heck, how can you tell since we use it mostly for storage as well (see what I mean when I say my parents keep  everything ??!)

      [Roz] As I was browsing around the  urlLink Power 92  contest section, I noticed that they have their own "Bachelorette" contest going on. So that got the best of my curiosity and I started browsing through the male contestants just to see if they were decent looking (not looking for myself of course!!), or big geeks who like teeny-bop music too. I think it's a fair share of half and half. Then the funny part was when I realized that I actually went to high school with one of them!!!! His name is  urlLink  Jay  and I never knew him personally since he was two years older than me. He was actually in the "popular" crowd too. Seems strange when you actually see someone you semi-know in these kind of contests. It's just  so cheesy!  There's no other way to describe it! I know all you AOB folks are probably laughing your heads off too!!

      3d= Funny thing happened today...right after a long, but dull day at work, I started up my car and proceeded to grab my snow brush to clear the seemingly foot deep layer of snow from my car, a one-eyed homeless person (had a pirate patch on the other eye) walked up to me and asked if he could clear the snow for me.  My initial reaction was to say "No, sorry, but I don't have any money on me", but without hesitation, he insisted on doing it so I gave him my brush and he did a damn find job of it.  When all was done, he gracefully left without saying a word.  As I sat down waiting for my car to warm up, I started to think about his motivation for doing it.  The pessimist in me said that he wanted me to remember him so that next time we meet, I might give him some cash.  The optimist says that perhaps he was doing a fellow human a kind favor.  Alternatively, he may just have been really bored!!  I guess I won't really know until we meet again.  I will obviously remember him, but will he remember me?  Will he ask me for a handout?  Or will this memory fade into nothingness like so many others?  Whatever happenes, this one small gesture has impacted my life in a semi-meaningful way.  I hope we do meet up again!  3d

      3d=What a weekend!  After waking up at 3am and leaving on a bus for Jasper at 4:30, Roz and I were met by the bitter cold.  The temp when we got to Marmot Basin was -38C, after the "weather channel" posted a high/low of about -12/-20.  Only the t-bar was open and that freaked Roz and I out, cuz, although we've been taking snowboarding lessons this year, we tried the t-bar only once, since we never thought we'd need it.  After two unsucessful tries, Roz gave up.  About 1/2 hour later, I convinced her to try again and voila!, she got it.  We then proceeded to the recently opened chair lift.  It later turned out to be a decent day, including two chairlift "incidents" involving Suzy and one quite spectacular triple-flip wipeout by yours truly (thankfully, I don't think anyone saw it!!!).  Anyhow, all ended well.

In case you don't know, the LADS (me and my roomates; Lon, Adam, Dan, Sean) are having a new house party.  We've recently moved, and to celebrate, we're throwing a party for Saturday night.  Since Roz is the master of our website, I'll get her to post up the invite later.  Any questions, phone me @ 920.2863 or whitewhine13@yahoo.ca.  PS. If it's warm enough, we may even light up the firepit!  It's supposed to be +12C on Saturday (yes, the "+" sign IS correct).

      [Roz] Wow, you guys must think that I've been either incredibly lazy or incredibly busy. Well it's definetly the latter. And we all know that Dan is just plain lazy since he's posted maybe about 3 times since our blog opened.  Thanks Daniel for the support.   ;o) Actually, he's been busy moving and arranging in his new place. Well, last couple weeks have just been hair-pulling stress for me b/c my research wasn't going too well. As most of you know, I'm a psych intern working with autistic kids. I love the job - it's great, I get to help kids learn to function normally in their environments. 
 
  The research topic I've decided to investigate is "The Affects of Music Therapy on Language Acquisition" - basically finding out if music helps children learn language. I'm doing a correlational, observational study on a sample of 14 autistic children, all relatively non-verbal. Half of them take music therapy, and the other half do not. Well, right now, I have 7 in the music group and last week I only had 3 in the non-music group. I've been trying to get some more kids in the latter group and it's been really frustrating when people are not responding to my requests for help (like my supervisor). 
 
 And I woke up early Sunday morning to phone the people who are already in my sample to see how things are going, since I haven't recieved any surveys or consent forms back from anyone yet. Some of the people had questions and didn't bother to call me  (What the hell are they waiting for?) , while others seemed to not know what I was talking about (worse yet, I met with one of them!). Ugh, so you could imagine how frustrated I was, I bawled like a baby to Dan, who is the biggest sweetheart and offered to help me out in any way possible.  Thanks Dan, I love you.  (Sorry folks, there's got to be some cheese involved). 
 
 But as of this week, things are  s-l-o-w-l-y  coming together in terms of my research so I'm not so stressed out now. Yesterday, I went to my first ever "Spin Cycle" class - wow, like Sean said, "It's kicks the sh*t out of you" - totally! What an intense workout- but i loved it! Well...except for the part where I "canned" myself. I didn't really think a girl could, but man, I  know  now. Those seats are SO uncomfortable and I was trying to slow down, but momentum got the best of me and my crotch ended up meeting the tip of the seat - and  WHAM!  - I swear it went numb for a few seconds-  SCARY!  I have no choice but to go back b/c I already bought myself a 10 classes pass. Anyways, I figure this will totally help me tone-up for the houseboat Shuswaps trip this summer! It BETTER anyways.
 
 Tonight was my 2nd last soccer game, and we played against the "Barbie Doll" team. All the girls seem to be tall, skinny and blond. Oh yeah, they are pretty damn good too - they ALL run like there's no tomorrow. Last time we played them, we were soooo tired. So we were prepared to get our asses whooped tonight, when we found out they only had ONE sub on their team! So we led the first half with 2-0, but then they came back and tied the game. Oh well, at least we didn't get our asses kicked, and we played pretty awesome tonight.

      3d=When did Keilor road wash away?  I went for a run yesterday and a 50 meter stretch of the road is half way down the river bank.  It's pretty awesome!  I'll get some pics soon.  

Yeah, I got a game misconduct for slashing a guy who, after the play was over, gave me a strong shove.  I went to chop at his arm, he raised his stick, and my stick glanced off and hit him in the head (very lightly though).  On the other hand, one of my teammates got into a serious fight in our game tonight.  It'll cost him $50 and 3 games.  

I had 3 awesome days in Jasper Park Lodge...all paid for by my company.  During the day, we had some pretty heavy workshops on how we can improve as a company, but at night, it was party time!  Free drinks for everyone!  I capped it off with a great run around Lac Beauvert where I almost ran into a herd of Mountain Sheep.  I stopped as we stared at eachother for a brief minute, then a small dog that was with the people behind me darted out and scattered the whole flock.  

PS. sorry for not posting in a while, but mix some holidays with a dash of flooded basement and a pinch of broken internet modems and you get very little time to update.  

3d out

      [R-girl] This long weekend, D and I went up to visit his parents on Vancouver Island - Qualicum Beach to be exact. We flew to Vancouver Friday morning (at 6AM- ugh!), bussed it downtown and did some shopping and toured Stanley Park. Then late afternoon, we took the ferry out to Nanaimo where Dan's parents, Bill and Rose Marie, picked us up. Q Beach is located 1/2 hour away from Nanaimo.
 
 I have to say, we were very disappointed in the weather. Rose Marie always rubs it in our noses that the weather there is so nice and warm, and when we got there, it was nothing but rainy and cold (well, cold considering I only bought one pair of pants and the rest were shorts). I ended up wearing my jeans all weekend! Boo! I also only brought along one long sleeve shirt and a light jacket. Good thing I bought another long sleeved shirt in Vancouver (which I ended up wearing most of the time I was up there). 
 
 Despite the disappointing weather, D and I made the most out of it. Over the 4 days, we shopped, toured, watched hockey playoffs at the lounge in the hotel opposite Bill and Rose Marie's place, played a game of Scrabble with D's parents, mini-golfed, swam at an indoor pool of course, and went running around the neighbourhood (which was the only time I wore shorts).  
 
  Thanks for the wonderful hospitality, Bill and Rose Marie. You have a beautiful place! Looking forward to hopefully coming out this summer! :)

         vs.   
 YAY!!!!  OILERS WON   GAME 3 vs. DALLAS STARS! Whoohoo! It was a pretty exciting game, and alot different than the previous game, which included roughly 96 minutes total in penalties due to them being emotionally out of hand! The game today was a lot more calm and Oilers had lots of good opportunities to score. Dvorak scored the winning goal and it was the sweetest goal I've seen in awhile.  As well, Salo made some really amazing saves!
 
   In other hockey news, Dan's ball hockey team won tonight as well. It was a close game, the score was 2-1.  Highlights: Adam scored the first goal (way to go, Adam!), Dan got kicked out of the game during the 2nd half for misconduct. I'll let him explain it on here when he has a chance (let's see if he does type!).

      [Roz] I got the afternoon off b/c one of the kids I work with was sick today, so I decided to use this time to update the site. 
 
  This message is for those who are computer illiterate, or come here to skip the reading (in that case, I hope you ARE reading this) and just to check out the pictures...  I have created a link for the pictures...so please just  click on the white text to view photos.  Thanks all!
 
 
 Friday, April 4 
 Ok...going back exactly a week...last Friday was Jenelle's 19th birthday - awww, yes she's just a baby! Jenelle invited a small party to the Sicilian Pasta House restaurant.  I've never been there before, but the food was pretty good, however, not as good as I thought it would be. Dan agreed. He said the food at the location downtown was better than where we went (south side). It was fun because Jenelle decided to make it a up dress up event, so the guys wore suits and the girls wore skirts/dresses.  Sean and Lon decided to wear Metallica shirts  under  their suit jacket. It was awesome!  urlLink Check out the pictures from the restaurant and Sean and Lon's suits.  
 
  Then we headed back to the LADS' house to get ready for the bar (drink), surprise Jenelle with a cake Dan and I made the night before at my place.  HA HA, we have quite the story for that too....Dan and I used cake mix and we baked it in a non-stick pan. My mom asked us to take the cake out of the pan after it was baked, and to place it onto another pan that she didn't care about if it got all scratched up by a knife. So we loosened up the cake with a spatula, or we  thought  we did anyways. The cake ended up falling apart like puzzle pieces, so we stuck them back together and  glued  it back with icing. So the cake you actually see is upsidedown and crumbling, but no one could tell! And hey, it tasted pretty good too!  urlLink  Here's pictures of the cake, Jenelle opening the present and us killing time before heading out to O Byrne's Irish Pub. 
 
 Jenelle had a number wrote on her arms (at first - which then eventually trailed off to other body parts because she  ran out of room !!) every time she had a drink. She had 13 drinks, then vomited, and had 8 more drinks after that. She was sooo hurting the next day. Here's the photos from  urlLink The Bar.

      [Roz--OF COURSE!  Does Dan ever write? ] Hey all, I will update the site soon, but I've been pretty busy writing a research proposal paper that's due on Monday. I'm sure you guys are all busy studying for finals too!  I do have some entries to update and pictures from the weekend to display, which I will probably do sometime this week (hopefully). 
 
  Here's a  urlLink  link   for some of those who need a study break because your brains are just turning to mush and you need some stupid fun. 
 
   Good Luck on finals, everyone!

      Dan and I played a game of Scrabble tonight...and  *sigh* , he whooped my ass right from the get-go. Dan got a stunning 18 points on his first word, which, interestingly enough, was  orgasm.   He just kept racking up the points from there, while I was stuck with the crappy letters and practically setting him up for good spots (e.g., double/triple word scores) because I had no choice (really!) 
  Final scores:  Dan: 109 vs. Roz: 52 (boooo!)

      [Roz]  Blast from the Past 
 
 Last night, I was cleaning out my room, going through old memories from elementary and jr. high days. I came across notes, pictures, drawings and projects I made when I was younger. I flipped through this blue coiled scribbler that contained messages/notes between my elementary friends and I. Were we ever dorks! At the end of the book were dedications wrote by my grade 9 classmates for year end. From reading all the entries from the boys and girls that wrote to me, here's what I was remembered for in Jr. High:
 
 1) I was utterly, totally, absolutely, crazy  obsessed  with Keanu Reeves.
 2) I laughed so hard that I was known for my snorts.
 3) I loved soccer just as much as I loved Keanu.
 Wow, what a big dork I was! I guess not much has changed now that I think about it. I'm just not as fanatic about Keanu anymore (really!)
 
 Also, came across some photos of when I was younger, which triggered some sweet memories.
 
  This is when I lived in Calgary, and I was probably around 3 old. That's my younger brother, Merv. I remember  living  this moment as if it was yesterday. Mom and Dad had just filled the pool up and I was so excited that I jumped in it with my clothes on. After scolding me, Mom then made me go change into my cute, red swimsuit. Then, my brother (who's probably about 1 year old) jumps in with his clothes on, and  he  doesn't even get in trouble! I was SO mad! It's hard work changing into that swim suit when you're 3 years old, and Merv gets off easy when he jumps into the pool with his clothes on! Probably why I don't look so happy in this photo:
  
 
 I don't remember this picture, but obviously, the horse freaked me out. I have no idea who that man is (probably the care taker of the horse). I like this picture because I am holding Poppy, my favorite stuffed puppy I got on my first Christmas. She's been through the grinder - falling into (clean) toilets 3 times over my lifetime (mom had to hand wash her everytime), losing an eye in a stuffed animal fight with another stuffed animal (don't ask), and having my (late) dog play roughly with her, causing stuffing to fall out. The thing is, I still have her, and she is  still  my favorite. I can't throw her out, even though she's falling apart. I know Dan would love to throw her into the firepit. 
  
 
   
 
 When I went to Dan's parents house, I walked around the place to take a few photos of Dan in his younger years:
 Baby Dan taking a bubble bath- awww!

      [Roz] This May long weekend was all about relaxing.  
 
  On  Saturday morning , a few of the Sempeis (assistant instructor) and Senseis (head instructors) from my karate class packed on hockey gear to anticipate an exciting attacks class for the children's karate program.  It was the last class of the semester, and as tradition, we allow the kids to come pounce on us as hard as they want.  This was my first year participating as a "target".  
 
 What usually happens is that the instructors go one or two at a time, and we have scenarios. For example, we can pretend to be an old lady asking for the time, or a kidnapper, and then we are to grab the kid. This is when they would have to use their karate tactics on us. This year, we included music to add some spice to the excitement. Dan came to watch and took a couple pictures. Unfortunetly, the batteries died, so he didn't get any pictures of me in action, only in uniform. Here's me and 30 pounds later....
  
  One guy "WWF"ed me on my back when I was down...I think that was the only time I could have potentially become injured, but luckily, I wasn't too soar the next day. 
 
  Saturday PM: Went to Jenny Lynn's cabin party. Dan and I had originally planned to camp there, but because of the heavy wind and lack of sun, we decided to only go for a couple hours and return home that night. I stayed by the camp fire most of the night, trying to keep warm. It was a pretty good party in terms of entertainment, there was a DJ spinning tables, fireworks, and of course, the pleasure to watch drunk people say/do funny things. It even snowed for 5-10 minutes at one point of the night. Eventually, the wind died down, but it was still cold. It's freakin' May and it's  snowing...  and only 4 days ago, was it 20 degrees outside. Welcome to Canada, where the weather is always unpredictable.

      [Roz] Ok, here's what's new:
 
  *I didn't get into the Philosophy class because I would be over my credit limit if I do, since I am doing my internship. Anyways, it's 3 hours every Tues and Thursday, so it probably would have been a bit much, seeing that I work full time. 
 
 *Visited Dan's sister, Caroline and her super cute baby, Amanda on Sunday...
  
 
 ...and saw her walk on her own for the first time!!!
  
 
 *Joined a new soccer team,  Lions , and had our first game yesterday. I haven't played outdoor soccer since high school (that was four years ago!) so still trying to get back into it. I forgot how wide the field was!  Despite the rustiness, I think I played ok, got an assist with a (don't mean to brag here, but PERFECT) corner kick and Rhiannon booted it in. We ended up tying the game 2-2. Not bad considering, most of us met for the first time last night and the other team has been playing together indoor all season. 
 
 *Been working out  hardcore,  (as Dan puts it) - going to the gym about 5-6 times a week.  Trying to get bikini ready for the houseboat trip, which is coming up at the end of June! YAY!

      [R] Last night, Joe had a party at his cabin out in Buck Lake...I know, you're thinking,  where?!   It's about an hour and a half away south of Edmonton, not too far off Pigeon Lake. It was a cozy looking cabin and quite a place to party. I did bring my camera, but didn't end up taking any photos. Too busy playing drinking games with cards, consuming alcohol and chatting up some real interesting stories with others. There was also a camp fire, (Dan was sitting out there) - I meant to join the group outside but got too engrossed in this girl, Jean's, life stories about why she came to Canada (orginally from Belize) and her different and interesting
experiences. The room we ended up sleeping in was nice...except for the house flies flying around the top of the closet and on the window. Ewww! Regardless, it was a fun night,  thanks Joe! 
 
 On a different note, I received my program check to make sure that I have taken all the courses I need to graduate next year.  Unfortunetly, I have to face what I've been trying to avoid for the last 3 years - which is, taking another philosophy course. I took Philosophy 101 in my first year, thinking it was going to be such an interesting class - boy was I wrong! I  hated  it so much, and vowed never to take another philosophy class again. Much to my dislike, I find out that it is mandatory to take Philosophy 102 following 101. Then I heard the university was trying to change this, so that's why I put it off for so long...unfortunetly, they didn't change this policy fast enough. Grrrr. So I found out that Phil 102 is being offered in Spring...and it starts THIS WEEK! I'm having troubles registering into the class for some reason, so I'll have to call the university tomorrow to see if I can get in. I figure, 6 weeks of philosophy doesn't sound so bad compared to four months!!!  Wish me luck for getting into the spring course!

      [Roz] Things that have happened since last entry:
 
 * My parents and I woke up at 4:30am Wednesday morning to discover that our house was flooding due to a BIG huge crack in the toilet tank. Now, we have to do MAJOR renovations to the whole house, since the water leaked through the floor to the main floor and basement. But in a way, this is a good thing since our house could use some updating.
 
 *Played a soccer game tonight against a team composed mostly of Asian girls, and we kicked their ass 16-0!!!!! I scored 5 of those goals. Man, I don't even think I've ever even scored a hattrick in my life...and here I go, getting 5. After that, I didn't feel like scoring anymore, so I passed it on to players who didn't get a chance to do so yet. Then my coach switched the forwards with the defense lines, and man, I suck on De...but oh well, it didn't matter!

      Sorry folks, been really busy lately so I haven't had an opportunity to update the site. It was D's 24th bday on June 2nd, so I just want to wish him a  Happy Belated Birthday, Dan!!!!  on the website. We haven't really celebrated it yet, since we haven't had much time. 
 
 It was also our one year anniversary that day. So yay for us! Well technically, we didn't have our first date until June 6th, but we "hooked up" (i.e., kissed  ALOT ) on his birthday  (alcohol was involved- hehe).  We haven't celebrated our one year yet- but we're planning to climb Mt. Pyramid to celebrate it on the week of our houseboat trip (last week of  June). More updates with pictures soon....

      Ok, I'm not so cranky anymore- but still very anxious to finish my internship (THREE MORE WEEKS!).  Today, I did something stupid. I scratched up the front side of my dad's car by backing up into a stoned wall. I was concentrating too much on not hitting the car behind me, and over turned the wheel so that the car brushed up against the wall. Yikes.  Oops. 
 
 I built up scenerios in my head about what and how I should tell my parents...I was so nervous, yet anxious to tell them. I was mostly worried about being called  stupid or foolish  in Chinese by my mother, who I knew was going to flip out - and she won't ever let me forget it for as long as I live. I can just see it now...10 years from now when we have an argument that won't have  anything  remotely to do with cars, she  will  bring up this incident and somehow try to tie it into the argument.  For some reason, she's good at that, but most of the times, it's illogical. 
 
 Anyhow, I ended up telling/showing my dad, who is much more rational than my crazy Chinese mom. To my shock and relief, dad shrugged his shoulders and said, "Oh, it's no big deal, just the fender". I offered to pay for the repairs, and dad really didn't care whether it is fixed or not. Man, I'm glad one of my parents are laid back.  Then my mom found out and she actually didn't flip out on her usual rants. She was pretty calm about it, but of course - had to come to her own conclusions about how this happened - which means, she was trying to blame me and call me stupid in Chinese. 
 
  It reminds me of the only other time I got into an accident with my car, totally not my fault. Some girl opened her door into my car door and somehow my mom turned it around and tried to blame  me  for someone else's fault!! She is very irrational and I think she likes to see me feel guilty. I swear.

        Ouch...we got killed tonight in the soccer game. The final score was 7-0 for the snobby Ice girls. And I mean snobby - I would try to make a joke or say something nice to the girls and they didn't even crack a smile. Their last goal was sweet, a corner kick followed by a header right into the net - and I complimented to about 3 of them - not one bitch said "Thank you". Rudeness is one of my  biggest  pet peeves! Ugh. I have heard from other teams we played against how snobby these girls were (and how nice we were), and man, are they ever right. Well, what goes around, comes around....
 
 Think I sound bitter? I think I'm just in a pissy mood - not sure why. Pondering upon my life and I know I have it good, but I'm bored. I'm going to vent some anger: I don't want to work anymore, I just want to go back to school. I'm sick of working and waking up early 5 days a week to deal with some crabby kid in the morning, and his highly anxious mother.  ARGH! I hate having to worry about getting enough sleep and I'm sick of my research project I have to do for my internship.  On top of that, I'm frustrated in dealing with the multiple, non-stop injuries I am getting. Sunday, rolled my ankle  again . Tonight, I got my knee bruised good (so good, it hurts to bend it) and my shins are all painted with bruises. I know I'm being a big baby, but it feels good to bitch and whine -because we all need to sometimes.   I also need another holiday!

 Dan went paintballing today, in celebration of all the LADS birthdays, which all fall within 2 months (June and July).  He managed to get a really cool welt on his bicep, therefore, making it bigger (so of course he's proud of it).   urlLink  Check it out!

      Last night, D and I formally celebrated our one year anniversary (although it's almost one year and 2 months) by dining at a snazzy, expensive restaurant called Hardware Grill, then going to watch  urlLink Miss Saigon .  We also dressed up for the occassion, but unfortunetly my digital camera is *still* not fixed, even though the repair shop just gave it back to me. For some reason, it won't take pictures. :(
 
 Dinner was amazing...remember that scene in  Matrix Reloaded   where the women in the red dress has an orgasm after taking a bite of her chocolate cake? That was me. We had smoked salmon over perogies for an appetizer, then for a main course, I had duck and Dan had elk. Mmmm-mmm. All specially made. 
 
 After dinner, we walked to the Taste of Edmonton festival, where my dad was volunteering (serving food) for his company. He was dressed like a cowboy, it was so cute. 
 
 Miss Saigon was fantastic, definetly recommend people to see it. At the end of the play, this old lady a few rows behind us shouted at Dan and I to "sit down" from our standing ovation because she couldn't see. Dan yelled back, "But look around, everyone else is standing up!" but she refused to let us stand, so we sat back down (grrrr, I didn't want to).  I think she got alot of dirty looks from the people around us, so that was good. Two (hot) gay men snickered at her too and made a joke to us about taking her out.

      Holy, it's been almost a month since I've last posted!  We just got back from our weeklong houseboat trip in Shuswaps, B.C. and it was so awesome! One thing that wasn't so awesome: my camera had condensation in it, dont' know how it happened since I made sure it wasn't near water, but it didn't work after Canada Day. Luckily, it is still under warrenty so I'm going to get it fixed ASAP.
 
  
 In short, I'll give a brief summary of the trip and post pictures when I am able to.
 
  Saturday:  Dan and I went camping at Tunnel Mountain Campground, Banff.  Due to a sprained ankle of mine, we couldn't hike up Pyramid Mountain liked we had planned. 
 
  Sunday:  Went White Water Rafting in Canmore, and did some cliff diving on the tour. Lots of fun, but unfortunetly, not as intense as we hoped it to be, even though it was the intermediate class. 
  Drove to Sean's cabin in Fairmont to meet up with the 7 others. We all went to the hot springs.
 
  Monday:  Boarded the houseboat
 
  Tuesday:  Canada Day! Roz drank 3 beer bongs (well spilled the second one, but redeemed herself in the 3rd round), had some chocolate mint shots, a Mike's Hard Icetea, and a pina colada cooler - not necessarily in that order. 
 
  *Us girls covered our bodies with latex bodypaint in the shape of maple leafs - drew ALOT of attention from other boats.
 
 *I passed out earlier than everyone else.
 
 *Dan gets hit on by a couger (and Kelly has a picture of it too!!!!) while everyone parties on the beach.
 
 *I wake up in the middle of the night, go to the bathroom at least 8 times - puking 3 of those times. My very first time vomiting from drinking. 
 
  Wednesday:  Dock at a beach at night and explored an enchanted forest. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen - lush, soft moss covering everything. Dan and I rolled around in it for awhile, but poor guy, got multiple orange bug bites all over his legs - enough to make him look like he had a disease. D also loses his cell phone.
 
  Thursday:  D and I go sea-doing for the first time - FUN!
 
  Friday:  Yuck, I think it rained this day - it was probably a day for boardgames, but I can't exactly remember.
 
  Saturday:  Beautiful weather, suntanning on the roof of the boat, jumping off it. The guys did wrestling moves off the top of the boat, and D managed to pop an air mattress while attempting to land on it from up high. The best part: whipping up yummy drinks in the blender, competition style. 
 
  Sunday:  Final day on the houseboat - I felt sad! D, Kel and I went back home. Stopped in Calgary at Luciano's for pasta supper (mmmm!) and Peter's Drive-In for milk shakes. Yum!
 
  Today:  Cleaned out my suitcase, and FOUND Dan's cell phone at the underneath the hard panal bottom of my suitcase! Whoohoo!

  Here's my piercing! I know, you can hardly see it, it's so subtle! Actually, it probably looks like a wart in the picture since it's not sparkly like it should be...ack! But I still love it!  My mom didn't even notice it this morning and I was going to see how long it would take her to notice, but she discovered it tonight when I got home from the gym. 
 
  The Piercing Experience: 
 I was pretty nervous when Dan and I got to the parlor, and to make matters worse, D couldn't come into the room to hold my hand,  (wah!) .  I think it was the buzzing of the tattoo pen that really made me even more nervous, even though it wasn't there to get a tattoo. It just made the place sound like a torture chamber! 
 
 Ara, the piercer, sat me on the chair and I was hoping to get a little white diamond stud, but because of the power outage in Ontario, the parlor didn't receive their shipping that week and so they were stuck with a limited selection (by that, I mean TWO choices).  One choice was the smallest stud you could get, but it was so plain, it looked like a nail.  The other choice was a bigger stud with a purple gem - so I went with the latter choice.  I know I wouldn't have been happy with  the nail .
 
 Ara told me that if I needed to hang on to something, just to squeeze her leg (and I did take that advice) but I don't think I really needed to since it didn't hurt more than a pinch. It was over quick! I was happy! And my nose wasn't and still isn't red, so Dan can't call me Fudolph! HA! I can't even feel the pain right now - actually I forget that I have it and when I look in the mirror, it's a nice surprise!  Yay!

      I'm doing it...I'm getting my nose pierced!! ( This is Roz writing by the way, just incase anyone's wondering...but Dan never posts on here anyways ). I made an appointment for this coming Tuesday at  urlLink Bear's Skin Art & Tattoo  place. I'm going to get a little diamond stud (I want it to be very classy and subtle).  Since Dan already calls me "Fu" (as in shortening my last name - Fung) -he's already decided to nick name me "Fudolph" (as in Rudolph) because my nose will probably be red for a couple days. Hmm...not looking forward to that part. :/  I'll be getting it on the left side, since 99% of the people I've asked told me they see it on the left. 
 
 I'm excited, yet nervous at the same time. The girl that's piercing my nose told me to make sure I eat before I go in, so I don't faint. Yikes!  My parents are freaking out about it because they think I'm mutilating my face. It's definetly the riskiest thing I've done in terms of self-image, but I don't think it's over the top! I don't think I've ever heard of anyone's parents being okay with their child getting any kind of piercing aside from the normal earholes.

        urlLink   . It was my 22nd birthday Thursday (Aug. 7) and I celebrated by going out to one of my favorite restaurants, Tropika, a yummy Malaysian place, with my family and Dan.  After, I met up with some friends at Savoy's, a funky martini bar for drinks.  Click on the above picture for more viewing.
 
  Friday night, Michelle and I drove to Red Deer to party with my friend Kam, and his girlfriend Nikhol.  We first went to Manhatten Club, where they played crappy music and it was really dead. So when Nikhol and I decided to request a song to liven up the place, we saw a girl in the DJ booth flashing the DJ her boobs, and the perv was taking pictures of them!!! If that's what it took to get a song playing, no thanks!!! So we headed to the bar next door, which was called Catwalk, but it mind as well have been called 'Thunderdome' (now  Tonic , in Edmonton) since it was exactly like Thunderdome. It was fun and we got so drunk - ugh, next morning was not so pretty. But at least we didn't vomit!
 
  The next day, Michelle and I went with Kam to visit his parent's cabin out at Glennifer Lake, which is about half an hour outside of Red Deer. It is a rich, gated community -essentially, a high class trailor park! We went sea-dooing for most of the time we were there on Kam's 2 sweet silver and yellow sea-dos.  Michelle and I were quite the experts at falling off, and by the end of the day, we were experts at getting back on right away. At one point, it took us 10 min. to get back on! 
 
  Kam's dad had this wicked suped up golf cart - check out the chrome wheels! Kam's parents have these 2 CUTE sibling puppies, Cedes & Bentz (as in the cars), and they had matching girl/boy (fake?) diamond collars. So adorable!!!! Check out the pictures (click on pic)...

      Just a quick note... anyone got any suggestions for a topic on 'killing'? My "Sociology of Killing" class requires us to write a paper about anything in relation to the subject of killing. Yes, this is a super cool class and no, I'm not a psycho! Well...maybe some days...but that's a different story.

      I love jokes - especially ones I can relate to, got this in my email:
 
  A Chinese man walks into a bank in New York City and asks for the 
loan officer. He tells the loan officer that he is going to China on 
business for two weeks and needs to borrow $5,000. The bank officer 
tells 
him that the bank will need some form of security for the loan, so the 
Chinese man hands over the keys to a new Ferrari parked on the street 
in 
front of the bank. 
 
 He produces the title and everything checks out. The 
loan officer agrees to accept the car as collateral for the loan. The 
bank's president and its officers all enjoy a good laugh at the Chinese 
for 
using a $250,000 Ferrari as collateral against a $5,000 loan. An 
employee 
of the bank then drives the Ferrari into the bank's underground garage 
and 
parks it there. 
  
 
Two weeks later, the Chinese returns, repays the $5,000 and the 
interest, 
which comes to $15.41. The loan officer says, "Sir, we are very happy 
to 
have had your business, and this transaction has worked out very 
nicely, 
but we are a little puzzled. While you were away, we checked you out 
and 
found that you are a multi-millionaire. What puzzles us is, why would 
you 
bother to borrow $5,000?" 
  
 
The Chinese replies: "Where else in New York City can I park my car for 
two 
weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?" 
 
 
Ah, the mind of the Chinese...

       Kids 
 
 I love kids. Hell, I'm surrounded by them all the time.  They do the darnest, funniest things and you can't help but laugh.  For example, one of the autistic kids I work with, he has trouble with changes in his routine.  For transistions/ changes, we have a strategy for letting him know it's okay when things are different, by singing a silly song, "Things are different, that's ooookaaaayyyy...we just learnt another waaaaay!"
 
 Once, while doing his printing excercises, he attempted to write a "fancy" letter A (with the curls and everything) but his other interventionist (she's the one that told me this story) said he had to write it like how he learnt in school.  Well, he uses  our  strategy of when things are different - and he starts singing the song to her!!!! What a kid! He used our strategies on US to manipulate the situation to get his way... again!  Apparently, he's extremely good at this. 
 
 Very smart kid. Very manipulative kid. Sometimes I think that he's teaching us and not vice versa.
 
 Another example...today in karate, I had to teach the 4 and 5 year old beginners.  Usually, we don't take kids younger than 5, and even at that age, they sometimes are still too young to understand the fundamentals of karate.  It's a very disciplined class, and usually the kids are very good. 
 
 However...
 
 This semester, for some reason, all the crazy kids seemed to come all at once. Usually we would only have a few who are trouble makers, but about 80% of them are so undisciplined. I was losing my patience...
 
 so most of the class, I ended up getting them to do focus excercises (alot of jumping, answering questions, running, etc.) to follow directions. At one point, I did a name game, and one kid did not know his name. We thought he was just being a bugger, but after we found out what it was (from mom), we understood why he didn't know his name. 
 
 It was something from his (Black) culture, and  we   couldn't even pronouce it!
 
 *sigh* I wish I could be a kid again - have no worries, play all day, and annoy adults.

      Tonight, I went to watch  urlLink  "Swimming Pool"  - an independent film showing at the Princess Theatre with some girlfriends. It was a pretty good flick, but unfortunetly, it was not as racy as I had hoped it to be.  Damn.  It's about an older, traditional woman writer (Sarah) who goes to get away from her life in London for inspiration for her next book. She stays in her publisher's house in France and has an unexpected visitor - her publisher's daughter, Julie.  Julie is a very permiscuous and sexual person, and the movie is about the conflict between the two characters and something that goes wrong...  I recommend you guys watch it, I'd give it a 7/10. 
 
 On another note, as us girls were walking back to my car, a group of British fellows wearing Hawaiian print sarongs around their jeans asked us to join them for drinks for their friend's bday. Their accents were so cute, it was hard to say no, but we did turn them down because we had to get home to sleep! Poor guys though, partying on a Tues night on empty, dead Whyte Ave. I wonder if they found any other ladies to please....

         It is COLD outside. Seriously...I had to wear a scarf to school today (maybe because I don't own a fall jacket, and am not quite ready to wear my puffy winter jacket yet).  I noticed other students wearing mittens (which I  should  have done as well because my hands were  sooo  ready to fall off by the time the bus came) so I wasn't the only person who thought it would be too insane to start applying winter accessories this early. 
 
  However, I did notice a few "crazy" kids wear only t-shirts on the bus, thinking they are too cool to wear a jacket - and looking like they were permenantly frost bitten.  I'm glad I am out of those awkward teenage years - oh c'mon, you all know what I'm talking about, we've all been there thinking jackets were only for dorks on cold days. Now I realize that the "dorks" were the smart ones.  
 
  Oh, and by the way, the temperature was 10 degrees (that's right, PLUS 10 degrees) - but with a very chilly wind.  Does this make me a wimp?

        After a full first week of school, my girlfriends and I had a girl's night out.  We started out at Jenn's to drink for a bit, then headed over to Wooly Bolly's on Whyte.  Usually, it's a sausage party in there  (whoo hoo!)  - *ahem - I mean, not that it matters* - but anyways, last night, the ratio of girls to guys was 10 to 2.  Maybe because a girl's rugby team was there celebrating their provincial defeat, but you'd think this would bring in more guys.  However, maybe there were more girls because we were  expecting  a men's rugby team. The line up for the girl's bathroom was always incredibly long, and it didn't help that in one of the 2 stalls, someone had literally shit on the toilet seat!  Ewww! 
 
  It was a fun night, nothing too extraordinare happened, except maybe two girls making out while standing on chairs.  It might have been a quite a show for the guys if these girls were attractive (both were overweight and one was very manly looking).  I don't know what they were thinking....  Speaking of which, some other overweight dude took off his shirt when the song, "It's Getting Hot in Here" by Nelly came on...was he thinking this would get the ladies? I noticed he was dancing alone alot most of the night,  trying  to get girls to dance with him. I was watching as he grabbed one girl's hand and her lack-of-expression (she actually looked DEPRESSED!) was hilarious. He didn't seem to notice.
 
 Well, unfortunetly, it's back to the books for me!

      Well, to those of you waiting to read the result of the soccer tournament...I have some disappointing news. My team didn't do so well in the second and third games (scores were 4-0 for both games).  It was totally possible to beat both teams, however, I think our team just didn't give it our all, especially for the last game.  I ended up injuring my left ankle (argh!) while challenging for the ball, and am currently limping now.  :(  *Boo hoo!*

        My team (Roz) had our first game this morning in the
soccer tournament.  We played against a Tier 5 (one level higher than us), 1st place team. In the first 5 minutes, I thought for sure we were losers, because all the girls on that team had amazing control and awesome passes. Have you ever seen the movie  The Ladybugs ?  It's about a really crappy soccer team, and I'm sure we looked like that (at first).  They scored the first goal, but then we came back with a goal.  Actually, yours truly, did. *proud smile* 
 
 I had been challenging the goalie, who would come out of her net way too far, so finally, I decided to just shoot it in when she was coming out towards me.  It worked...(much to my surprise)! We were tied 1-1 at half time.  Then they scored another goal, but I scored another goal after that, shooting the ball into the high left corner (which surprised me again that it went in).  I'm sure the wind picked it up because I swear I saw the ball sailing in the air.  Shortly after, I assisted our third goal by crossing over to the center forward, who popped it in.  We were so excited that we sort of let our guards down and they came back with a vengence, scoring a minute later.  Grrr...back to a tie again!
 
 Finally in the last couple minutes, Teresa (right forward) scored our 4th goal and we held it to the end.  YAY! So what seemed like an iffy game turned out to be an exciting and defeating one! My team has 2 more games tomorrow. First place team gets $450.  Wish us luck!

       Hooray for Beer!   
I got this awesome quote in an email today: 
  
 as explained by Cliff Clavin, of Cheers. One afternoon at Cheers, Cliff Clavin was explaining the Buffalo Theory to his buddy Norm. Here's how it went: 
   
"Well ya see, Norm, it's like this... A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That's why you always feel smarter after a few beers." 
  
 Cheers!

       urlLink Kelly , you weren't the only one who had an epic battle...I may have a story to top yours. 
  
So last night, I was eager to try putting in a new stud I got for my 2 month old nose piercing.  Now, for those of you with piercings, you know that you're  supposedly  not to change your piercing until 3 months after you get it.   
Well...oops...impatient me. 
  
I really wanted to wear my new pretty silver-and-blue gem star stud. 
  
My initial piercing is one of those nose rings with the hook (like  urlLink this ), so it was a bit odd to take out, but not difficult. 
  
I put in the new stud (which is just a plain straight stud), which was easy enough.  Dan and I admired it for a bit...then I started to worry. Since it's smaller than my other stud, I should put back in the hook stud so that the hole can finish healing for one more month. 
  
Then...that's when the battle began...
  
I literally spent over an hour in Dan's bathroom, poking and forcing my old stud back in, trying to manipulate the hook in every way possible...but the damn thing wouldn't go through the end of the hole!! ARGH!
  
So Dan tried twice...(now can you picture Dan practically having his fingers up my nose?!) and still no luck! 
  
I was so frustrated that pain was not an issue anymore, I just didn't want the hole to get smaller, so I tried probably like, 5 more times. 
  
An hour and fifteen minutes later, I gave up (left the new stud in)...for awhile...until I went home.
  
Then I spent another good fifteen minutes in my own bathroom to poke the sucker through and at this point, there's already some dried up blood from earlier on.  Finally, I decided that it wasn't going to go through (I know, it took me long enough to figure that out). So I just put the new stud back in.
  
But the battle wasn't over...as I started to wash my face, the stud  fell out  and went  into  the drain...
  
 Noooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!   
  It was already one in the morning and I certainly wasn't going to wake anyone up to help me find it! But then, I put on my glasses (I'm so blind without them) and realized that luckily, the star part caught onto the top of the drain and didn't entirely fall in yet. 
    YAY!!! There was a chance! Talk about lucky star!    
I took some tweezers and with most precision and care, I managed to get it out.  Saved! 
So now, I guess I'm stuck with my new stud for awhile. 
  
And I'm happy with that.

      Taking the bus can be an interesting experience in terms of converstions I overhear.   
Today, I had the fortunate (I say this with in the most sarcastic tone) experience of listening in on a conversation between two high school aged girls. They were probably no older than sixteen. One girl sat beside me, while the other sat in front of us.
  
The girl that sat in front of us (Girl A) turned around and said to the girl beside me (Girl B): This f*ckin' guy just asked me if my f*uckin' tits were real!!!!   
So I did what any person would have naturally done...I checked out her chest. (PS- they weren't *that* big, but big enough for a skinny 16 year old I guess). 
   Girl B laughs.
   The two girls ramble on for a bit about the guy commenting on her chest. Then Girl B asks Girl A what she did last night.
  Girl A:  Oh man, I got so f*cking high last night at (insert boy's name here) house and we got so f*ckin' drunk too 
  The two girls go on about getting drunk and high on weed for a bit then return to the topic of the guy commenting on Girl A's chest. 
  Girl A:  When he asked me if my tits were real, I should have said 'Why don't you find out for yourself?'  
  ACK! Girl A's in-your-face-I-need-to-swear-every-five-words attitude turned me off so much from even thinking she could be anything but white trash. I can just see this girl in three years...pregnant, living off her drug dealer boyfriend who's 8 years older, doing drugs and drinking booze daily...  
I hope I'm wrong about her, but I guess I'll never find out.

       Saturday 
  
Every year, Dan takes up a part-time seasonal job with Nintendo.  Basically, he goes to different locations to promote Nintendo products. This year, training took place in Calgary, so I decided to tag along to meet up with my friend Cory (who lives in Calgary) to go shopping. 
  
Cory and I went to Chinook mall, where I made some lovely purchases (i.e., sweet deals). At this time, Cory was unaware of what Dan was down in Calgary training for, so when he found out D was working for Nintendo, he commented on his friend Kylan working for Nintendo as well. I practically freaked out when I realized that D had introduced me to Kylan last year when he was up in Edmonton promoting Nintendo at the Ski and Snowboard Show. I knew that Kylan was in training with D at that moment of discovery.
  
So when D called me after his training session was over, I told him what a small world it was.  Kylan later called Cory to ask how the heck he knew Dan's girlfriend (of all people!) and it's actually a funny story because Cory and I met in a bar last year (in Edmonton), and this was actually the second time we had seen each other.  
  
Cory and his friends were up in Edmonton for a stag party, when they approached my girlfriends and I to sign their friend's scrubs (traditional stag practice). We mostly talked to Cory and Jeff, who are genuinely nice guys (i.e., not trying to hit on us) and since we had alot in common, we exchanged emails.  
  
Cory and I met up with Dan, Kylan and 3 other Nintendo members on 17th (which is equivalent to Whyte Ave in Edmonton).  The shops there were plenty vintage or big, expensive name brands.  One shop even had two models posing on podiums like mannequins, to fashion the clothes.   Cory and I got a kick out of watching ALL the cars slow down as they were passing by the store to check out the models.  I almost asked one girl how much she got paid to stand there, but I didn't think that would be appropriate. 
  
Eventually, we ended the night after dining together at an Italian restaurant.  When Dan and I arrived back to his (new) condo, we were eager to watch the 3rd period of  Oilers vs. Colorado .  Unfortunately, since D doesn't have cable yet, the TV didn't work at all, so we had to listen to the game on the radio.  
  
We drank a few beers while we listened to the exciting game. We totally expected Colorado to kick our asses, but when we kept hearing about Oilers scoring over and over again, we were deeply regretting not going to a pub to watch the game.  (The final score was 6-3!!!) 
  
We ended the night by playing the new Nintendo games D will be promoting. I was feeling pretty buzzed (but not drunk) after 3 beers  (haha Q, I have higher tolerance than you!)  and let me tell ya, playing Nintendo intoxicated is fun!

       Friday Night 
  
Dan and I went over to Jamie's house for a bonfire.  It was a nice and relaxing night, we couldn't believe how beautiful it was outside, for October weather at night time Edmonton! The most entertaining part was watching Quang make a drunken fool of himself - after four beers! 
  
Well, you have to understand that Q does not drink, and he's asian (i.e., cheap drunk!) so four beers, though it may not seem like a lot, it is for us asians. 
  
We got on the topic of how easy it is to return things to Walmart.  Simon started spewling out stories of how much he takes advantage of Walmart's return policy.  Like the one time he bought 4 cans of fuel lighter, and only used up one, so he returned the other 3, only he accidentally mixed up an empty can with a full one.  So as the cashier was ringing them through, she was shaking them, and even though she knew the 3rd can was practically empty,  she still gave Simon the FULL refund !
  
?!
  Another example to show how retarded Walmart is, Simon told us how he had successfully returned a tent (still with leaves inside it and probably some dirt on the exterior) and a GT racer, still dripping wet with water.  
  
And the  best  example that night was when one of Simon's friends who had worked at Walmart told him about the story of how a customer returned a sofa to Walmart, getting $300 back.  The kicker? Walmart has NEVER even sold sofas before!!! 
  
Speaking of Walmart, I doubt those dares I posted in the previous post will seem odd to anyone working at Walmart now....

       I DARE YA 
     
I dare you to go to Walmart and proceed with one of the following choices:    
*Walk up to an employee and tell him/her in an official tone 
  'Code 3 in house wares ' and see what happens. 
  
*Set up a tent in the camping department and tell  other shoppers 
 you'll only invite them in if they bring pillows  from the bedding 
 department. 
  
*Dart around the store suspiciously while loudly humming the 
 theme from "Mission Impossible". 
  
*Hide in the clothing rack and when people browse through say, 
 "Pick me! Pick me!" 
  
*Move a 'CAUTION - WET FLOOR' sign to a carpeted area   
*Go to the Service Desk and ask to put a bag of  M&M's on lay 
away  
 Lon, this one's for you:  Do the Orx Song  (for those of you who are wondering what the hell the Orx Song is...it is basically screaming in a bloody high pitched voice "Kill the Orx, Slay the Orx, Desssstrooooy theeee ooooorx!") It's really amusing, especially when Lon does it, because he does it best.

       *Whew*  This was a big weekend! Dan moved out of the house and into a condo he bought recently - so  Congrats Daniel  on the bitchin' new pad.  This is the first time Dan's on his own without a roomie. Unfortunetly, I did not have a chance to take photos of his place yet, but there'll be comin'! Dan lives on the fourth floor, which also happens to be the top floor - and there's no elevator in the whole building, so you can imagine how sore our legs are after climbing up and down 8 sets of stairs (2 per level) literally all day! 
 
  Special thanks to Dave, Carolyn, and Keith for helping out!  
  We haven't set a date yet for a house warming party, partly because we are not quite finished arranging the furniture.  However, I suggested that it be a semi-formal martini party and D liked that idea.  This type of mellow party would be more suited for his limited living space than the loud, crazy parties that the guys usually hold.  I'm excited! Keep checking back for the pix!

      Remember how I thought I did so awesome on that first exam I wrote? Well...bad news (or maybe I should say "embarassing" news, since I told everyone I thought I did great)...I only did okay. I got a B.  I was 0.75% away from getting a B+. Wow, isn't that *bleeping* annoying? 
 
 I feel  extremely  disappointed in myself and still somewhat in denile, because I don't understand how my mark can be that much lower than what I expected. 
  
It's just frustrating because I study so hard and think I know my stuff inside and out - and then when I write the exam, the results are sometimes disappointing (but thank god, not always!) 
  I think I'm just freaking out because I'm scared I won't have high enough grades to get accepted into grad school.  My biggest fear is failure. :o(
  
On a brighter note, the Edmonton Oilers won their first game of the season against San Jose Sharks! The game was a bit slow in the first period and picked up a bit in the second and third. The final score was 5-2.  Go Oilers Go!

Dear Simon,
 
 When I asked to go running with you, you should have warned me that you are training to be the next Donavon Bailey. 
  Oh...wait, you stopped  seriously  running a while ago. Sheesh, I'd hate to see how fast you can  really  go!  
  
 Thanks for teaching me how to run with my chest sticking out and leaning forward, while going down big, hilly trails. 
 
 You're right. It was a good ab workout.
  
I should have known that my clumsiness factor would kick in while letting myself shoot down that big downhill.
  
Man, tripping over that rock wasn't cool...and to boot, my face practically skimmed the heel of your shoe as I was crashing into the ground. 
  
But I must say, I do look completely hardcore now. It sure compliments the two 
 other  bruises I have on each of my shins, from sparring in karate last night. 
  
I'll be sure to give you a call when I want to have the shit kicked out of me again. ;o) Thanks Simon! It 
 was  a good push for me (no pun intended)!

      *SIGH* After searching the Hub's lost and found, Hub administration,  and   campus security  (yes, they actually suggested I check there, sounds weird to me too)  - no sign of my pretty blue Nalgene water bottle.  
 
In other news, I just spoke with  the  dumbest, ditziest girl (receptionist) ever! I just phoned a hair salon to book a hair appointment, and she answered.
  Me:  Hi, can you tell me about your promo you have this week about the free highlights? 
  Girl:  Oh...I -uh- don't really know anything about the- uh- promo...(nervous giggling)...yeah...uh... 
  Me:  Well is there someone I can talk to who knows? 
  Girl:  (More nervous giggling) Well, uh, like, I'm, like, the only, like, receptionist here, like, right now...maybe, like, you can phone back, like, tomorrow? 
  Me:  (thinking how many times does this girl have to say "like" in one sentence!?!?!") Well, can I just make an appointment for Wednesday at 2pm? 
  Girl:  Sure...Wednesday, like, what time? 
  Me: ?! 
 (Didn't I JUST tell her?!) ...Two...Foooor Weeeedddnnnessssdaaaaayyyy. 
 
  Ok, I really didn't exaggerate "For Wed" but I should have...judging her, she probably would put it down for today or something. 
 
  I couldn't believe there are actually people that talk that stupid! Maybe she had too many chemicals in her hair and it fried her brain? Oh well, makes me feel a little smarter knowing that there are people as absent minded as this girl.

      Man, I just realized I lost my water bottle that I paid about $12 for- I mean, that is pricey for a water bottle! It's one of those pretty colored, one litre, see-through bottles (can't remember the company who makes them, but I know it starts with an N).  
 
 I was about to go out and help my friend Tom to deliver karate flyers, when I remembered that I should bring water.  So I searched my bag for it, then the rest of my room, then the kitchen (all in a matter of 3 minutes!) and realized that I must have left it in the bathroom, in a stall, on top of the toilet paper dispenser - on FRIDAY.  ARGH!  I had even thought to myself that one of these days, I'm going to forget it there. And so I did. 
  
So tomorrow I am going to search the lost and found in Hub mall for it. I hope a janitor bought it there...if not, I would assume that a sick person took it! Who would take someone else's water bottle anyways!? That's gross! What if I had some disease (just for the record...I don't) and this person is going to drink out of it (I mean,  I still wouldn't be comfortable drinking out of 
 someone else's   water bottle even after washing it)! 
 
 And the worst part? I've only had the water bottle for two weeks. *sob*  Come back, pretty colored water bottle!

       Suzy's Night with the Girls 
 
  Congrats to Suzy and Stefko on the engagement!!! In celebration, Jenn held a girl's get together dinner at her place last night.
 
  
  Jenn and Susan:  Ooooh! Aaahhh! 
 
  
 
   
 Jenn's place isn't very big, so we had to resort to using the couch (in kneeling manner) because she didn't have enough chairs. 
  Headed off to Wooly Bolly's after:
  
 
  
 Took this shot staring at the mirrored wall at the dance floor...I think it turned out cool.
   
 Bumped into Fernando, a dude I went to high school with (I didn't even recognize him!)

  *I messed around with photoshop to create some funkiness into the following photos*   
  
 I surprised Quang with my camera as he greeted me at my door (although he doesn't look *too* surprised). Ladies...he's single! 
 
  
 Went to The Three Muskateers Restaurant, in which, the bathroom impressed me more than the food. What can I say - it's (my fave color)- pink!
 
  
  I always did want a pink background...
 
 Then we went to Chapters where I attempted to take some shots I thought might be interesting.

        Dan and I went to watch the independent film,  urlLink  "Bend it Like Beckham"   last night. It was such a good movie, and SO funny! I really liked the cultural aspect and it's humor of the movie (East Indian family in London).  I love movies that really play on culture- and it's even better when they play up the stereotypes.  I think this really shows that people can laugh with others at some of the funny aspects their culture has to offer.  And even better, the movie was about my favorite sport - soccer! 
 
 The last good soccer movie I saw was the 1992 movie, "Ladybugs". Remember that, with Jonathan Brandis?! That was one of my favorite movies when I was younger.  (No, I'm not kidding either! I know, what a dork!) Did anyone else like this movie too? 
 
  Now I'm just waiting for someone to release a comedy involving Chinese culture - then I could really relate!

      So here I am, happy and relieved that the exam is over.  At the start of the exam, I swear, I've never seen so many students panic and freak out over a midterm before.  And this class isn't small! Anyways, I think I did fairly well, considering I only got stuck on 2 questions really. I just hope I answered the "short-answer" questions to the prof's satisfaction.  
 
 I was so stoked that the exam was not as hard as i thought it would be, that I had so much energy afterwards.  I went to work out and practically sprinted on the treadmill for 20 minutes! Whew! I'll keep you posted on my exam mark!
 
 D and I are going to watch a movie tonight - I haven't been to the theatre in ages! I'm excited!

      UGH! DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH I LOVE THE BUS!?!?!? ESPECIALLY when it snows for the first time in a long time!? Yesterday, it took me TWO HOURS (YES...T-W-O) to get to school. I missed my University bus that I transfer onto from the bus terminal, so I decided that I'd be smart and take a bus downtown, then catch the LRT (train) that takes me straight to the University.

   HA HA!  
  Little did I know that I'd be stuck on the bus for another hour going downtown! I managed to sprint all the way from the LRT station to Bio Sci Building (for those of you who have no clue how far that is...it's about a 10 minute normal pace walk)- I got there in probably 4 minutes to catch the last 15 minutes of class. Actually, not even...it was more like the last 12 minutes. 
  
Then...going home, I took a 4pm bus - and NOW I'M REALLY LOVIN' THE BUS because it took me about another 2 hours and a half to get home. The worst part is, it took the bus AN HOUR to get from University bus station to the university HOSPITAL. For those of you who don't know the distance, this is about a 10 minute walk. A TEN MINUTE WALK TURNED TO AN HOUR LONG DRIVE. 
   How pathetic. 
    *Sigh*  I guess I gotta learn to love the bus...but it's making my life so difficult!

      This weekend has been a busy yet awesome one. The head Sensei (8th degree black belt head instructor) of our world organization came down to hold a 4 day workshop, which began on Friday.  On Saturday night, we held a banquet for the head Sensei (Leonard), as our guest of honor.  He's an amazing man, so much knowledge, yet so down to earth. 
  
      
This is Sensei Leonard and I at the banquet...mmmm the buffet was so good! Anyways, the night was just a lot of laughing, mostly thanks to my (own) sensei's - Sensei K (I know...so many senseis it gets confusing) 8 year old daughter, Monika.  She was making me laugh all night by making funny faces and then managed to get other adults to join in with her. So imagine a fancy banquet, and half the adults are making faces like this: 
     
  
Oh, and Sonny, who is my equal in rank (we are both second degree black belts), and he's watched me grow up from the age of 14 (ha I know...GROW UP! good one!) as we went up the ranks together. Anyways, we always joke around and I had asked him to take a picture of me and Dan together. Well...he ends up taking a picture of my chest ON PURPOSE! What a perv! 
  Anyways, Monika ended up seeing this picture when she was playing with my camera, and asked me what that was. I just told her to ignore it because it was a mistake...but then everytime she tried to take a picture of me...that's where she would AIM! I think she didn't know any better though. 
   And Monika loved my camera so much, she figured out how to play with the settings on her own. She was so hyper after eating a nanimo bar (very sweet chocolate dessert) that she was all over Dan, and getting him to do hilarious things. Looks like I have some competition now....
     
   In today's workshop, we learned basic training on the weapon called "Shindo".  It's like a 3.5 feet long stick. Very cool...unless your partner accidentally whacks you in the boobs.  Ouch! 
  By the way...what do you guys think of me in my new traditional asian dress, Dan's 80's mesh styled Nintendo hat and my white sneakers? Stylish, no?

      Last night, Dan's housewarming party was so much fun! So much good food! There was veggies & dip, chips 'n salsa, and we even had three people bring spinach dip with bread...yum!  Thanks to all who brought/ made food!   
Not to mention, so many good drinks too! George has got one hell of a talent for mixing drinks - those on the house boat trip will surely agree!  Thanks George, for taking care of the drink mixes!    
As you will see in the pictures, we had our own version of "class": plastic cups with a raw speghetti (in place of a toothpick for an olive) dipped in the cup. Who cares though, it's the taste of the drink that counts. 
  
Although, I can't say that Dan's sparkling champagne and vermouth drink tasted good...even with the additional frozen raspberries.  Bleh!  I can't believe he drank a whole glass of it too.   
We all headed out to Scuffy Murphy's later in the evening, which only costed us less than $5 to cab it back to D's place. Sweet deal.   
Thanks to all who attended! It was a great night!

      D and I saw  urlLink Matrix Revolutions  tonight.  I'll get straight to the point - we both were a little disappointed; it wasn't anything like the first and second ones. It was mostly based in the "real world" (as oppose to The Matrix) and was too sci-fi for me.  There seemed to be some moments that were cheesy, but that's my own humble opinion.  What did others think? Which Matrix movie was your favorite?

       Happy Halloween!!! 
  
1) Drank at MJ's place  
2) Limo came earlier than expected (it was part of MJ's birthday party package hosted by Tonic), so we had to slam back our drinks 
3)Limo ride - pimpin' pretty blue lights surrounding the interior (from what I can remember). Slammed back another drink.  
4)Arrived at Tonic - skipped the line and cover charge (star treatment!)
  
It  started  out as a great night for me...until...five drinks later (I slammed them back in less than an hour)...I wasn't feeling so great. I ended up vomiting three times in the club (never made it to the bathroom..Ooops!) and once on the way home (thanks Dan for taking care of me!).  And there were WAY TOO MANY PEOPLE at Tonic (club). Being  too  drunk in such a crowded place made me feel clastraphobic. Oh, and by the way, FYI, this is only the second time that I've vomited as a result of drinking.

      Hmm, I've got alot of catching up to do. Let's make a brief summary of my week:
  
 Dec.23-25:  
My brother and I drove down to meet my parents in Canmore for Christmas. We skiied (well, my bro and I snowboarded) at Sunshine Village on 24th and 25th. There were lots of New Zealanders and Australians skiing there, and I always love listening to their accents. The skiing conditions were good the first day and absolutely perfect the second day since it had snowed on X'mas eve. So powdery, it was like heaven. It was an excellent time. I got alot of Victoria's Secret merchandise (not lingerie) from my parents, and some lucky money. Merv and I came back on the night of Christmas.  

 Dec. 26  
Spent my last day with Dan before his big trip to Australia. It was nice, but sad.  Yes, I did cry when we had to say good-bye.  Awww.  I have to keep reminding myself it's only for 2 months (well, 7 weeks, but saying 2 months seems shorter). Dan gave me my Christmas presents that night. He got me Green Tea (which I love), some sparkly, pretty Cranberry lotion from the BodyShop, and a red babydoll type lingerie from La Senza. Unfortunately, when I tried on the lingerie, we both thought that it did not really suit (i.e., FLATTER) me, and I thought I looked rather preggo. "But it looked good on the La Senza models," Dan says.  Hello? I do not have a La Senza model body!  Of course I did not get upset that the lingerie didn't fit, I just understand that it's better suited for taller and slimmer women. For me, my torso was too short and all you could see were my muscular thighs poking out of the outfit. I looked rather terrible. That's ok, I get to exchange it for anything I like. 

   Dec. 27-30  
Jenn and I took the Greyhound to Calgary, where her step-mom, Olga, and her dad,  Ta Ta  (that's "dad" in Polish), were waiting for us so that we could all go to Fairmont together. We were only there until the 30th, so we fit in 2 days of skiing (for her) and snowboarding (for me) at Panarama the first day and Kimberly the next. Panarama sucked because it was icy and Kimberly was in okay to good conditions.    
Jenn's boyfriend, Steve, picked us up this morning and we went back to Edmonton. It was Steve, Jenn and Andrew in the front seat of the big truck and Rob, me and Mark in the backseat. It actually was not as squishy as I had imagined it to be, and it was quite comfy. We had great conversations about music, sex and diarrhea.


  The major highlight of the roadtrip back was when the boys started arguing about how long each one of the divided dotted-white-lines were on Highway 2. Steve was convinced that a line was about 15-20 feet long and Mark and Andrew were rooting for 10-15 feet.  So what did they do after arguing for ten minutes?  Steve pulls over on the side of the road, gets his measuring tape out and into oncoming traffic, him and Rob run out and measure a line in 2 seconds as the cars get closer and closer, then they sprint back to the truck.  The result?  The line was 13 feet long, so  Mark and Andrew were right. I wonder, was it really worth risking your life to know how long a freakin' line on the road was?!

   Okay...I need to get personal and get something off my chest right now, blow of some steam... 
  I had fun most of the trip, but I seemed to see a side of my so-called best friend that I haven't really experienced before and I didn't like it. She was impatient, condesending and a bit unappreciative at times, which really hurt and disappointed me. I pretended it wasn't that bad, since most of the trip she was pretty much herself. 
  However, she had pulled the last straw when later on tonight, she called me to tell me that I could not invite my other best friend, Michelle and her boyfriend Byron, to Steve's New Year's party. She used the excuse that Steve did not know them well enough, was worried that something may happen to his place, and that there would be too many people. These were not valid arguments since Steve did not know any of our other friends that I invited and I called her on it. She also knew very well that both Miche and Byron would not do any harm and what is 2 more people anyway?  Also,  I was definitely not going to scoop to a low level to snub Michelle and Byron just to go to a party full of people I hardly know. I'd much rather spend New Years with a small group of close friends if that's how it's going to be. 

  It made me so mad when Jenn said this to me, and it only made me more angry when she called back to tell me that there had been a mix-up and that either I or she misunderstood that Byron and Michelle could not come. Right then and there, I smelled total Bullshit, so I called her on it again. The only reason why she didn't want Miche and Byron there was because she's not fond of him...not because she doesn't know him (like she used as an excuse). For #*&$% sake, Miche and Byron have been together for 4 years, so don't tell me she doesn't know him. That is total crap and she knows it. If she really wanted them to come, she could have  easily  convinced her boyfriend to let them come. 

  How can she do this to a group of friends? How can she make it so that some are good enough and others are not, to come to a party? Especially when she knew very well that nothing less is expected that New Years should be spent with closest friends. Did she really expect me to be okay with snubbing them? That bothers me so much, and it bothers me even more that she seems like she could care less that everyone else but me, comes or doesn't come to the party. I think the biggest reason she wants me to be there is not because I'm her so-called best friend, but so that she doesn't have to feel uncomfortable around Steve's friends, since she claims she's shy, but totally isn't. Hey, isn't that using someone?

  It's amazing how in 4 days, you can learn so much about a person and realize they are not who you think they are. All these years of friendship and as different (as in an odd, peculiar way) as Jenn is and as unreliable as she is, she has been a good friend to me for the most part. Interesting how my perspective of her can change in 4 days.  I talked to one of my friends who use to be good friends with her in high school, and her words struck me:  I'm sorry you had to find out about Jenn this way.   These words confused me even more, but after this friend explained how she had a similar experience with Jenn, I understood. I painfully understood and could not believe it. All these years, I didn't understand why these 2 girls (also my friends) had drifted away from Jenn since the three of them were so tight in high school. All these years, it had been there and I was so blind to the truth. 

   I feel so confused, yet angry, and saddened by this whole situation. It makes me a bit cynical. Man, Jenn was someone who I thought I could live with, but after these 4 days, I know I can't. We were also planning to possibly take a trip together to France, but there is absolutely no way I would go with  just  her. I cannot explain it, but some of the things she says or does are so insensitive, condescending, confusing and contradictory, that, by the time I answer, I am still in shock of what or how she has said her words.  I am pretty sensitive, and some of the things she said or did on the trip really hurt me, even though they weren't a "big deal". It just hurts because she's never really treated me this way before and I had no idea who she was half the time. I mean, is this who she really is? Was this just a "bad 4 days" for her? I'm sure we'll stay friends, but I'm not sure if I could consider her a best friend now. It doesn't seem right to. I could go on about other things that frusterate me about her, but then I'd be getting into details. I'll spare you that. 
   I really wish you were here right now, Dan. You're so good at comforting me in a way that no one else can. 
  Anyway, I am totally looking forward to spending New Year's with my closest group of friends tomorrow evening. Hope you all have a great New Year! I'll keep ya posted on what happens. Thanks for reading.

      Two more days until Christmas!   
But...  
Four more days until Dan leaves for Australia/New Zealand. *sob*   
My brother and I will be going out to Canmore (where my parents are already) to snowboard over the next two days and then come back home late on Christmas Day. Dan will be spending time with his parents, who are up here visiting, and one of his aunts.   
Since I won't be seeing Dan on Christmas, I gave him his presents (yes...lucky boy, he got more than one from me) tonight. I got D a sweater that has a bidirectional zipper, utensils, a journal that I decorated and personalized for his trip, and I painted this portrait of us:   
   "Sweet Temptation"   
This was the first time I've done a portrait, and I'm quite impressed with how it turned out. It has a funky vibe to it. D liked it alot (unless he's lying and trying to be nice!).   
  So what are you doing for Christmas? 
   Have a very  Merry Christmas!

      Saturday night at Lon, Sean and Keith's "Palace" (i.e., new pad) for a formal Christmas dinner. 
   Appetizers, turkey, stuffing, salad, veggies, shrimp, eggplant extravaganza, rice and TONS of deserts (that the guests brought)- all made for an excellent meal! I think we all ate too much! 
    Thanks boys, it was a great meal!   
   A game of Socialbles and an attempt at Sharaids were played after dinner. Everyone wrote words/phrases for the Sharaids game, then they were all collected into a bowl. There was too much screaming (I'm not pointing any fingers, Sean and George!) so we couldn't have a proper game of Sharaids. Instead Joe used his creativity again and took pictures with the labels and weird shit.

      Whohooo! I am ALL done exams! My first one in the morning (which I studied hardcore for) turned out to be not as difficult as I thought it would be - or maybe I only thought that because I knew the answers? Yes, that was probably why...so all that studying paid off! 

   However, I had another exam that same afternoon, and the studying for that exam was not as extensive as the first. In addition, the class average was quite high on the second midterm and since we're not on a curve, the prof said he had to bring down the class average by making the final harder. Well, shit, I didn't know he was going to make it IMPOSSIBLE!!! Check this out...60 multiple choice, 2 essay questions and 10 short answers...all to be completed in TWO hours!!! Ridiculous! 

   I know I did poorly on that exam because it was cummulative and I had only skimmed through the previous 8 chapters from earlier this semester and concentrated on the latter 4 chapters. Since half the midterm was based on the previous 8 chapters, I was in deep shit - there was alot (and I mean A LOT) of B.S.-ing happening on the short and long answers, and alot of guessing on the multiple choice component. I'll be lucky if I pass *gulp*. I haven't felt that shitty in a long time about an exam. Even the girl that got high 90's on the 2 previous midterms thought this exam was tough - what does that say?
  
The weird part is, I was not too upset about the exam because I was EXTREMELY happy to be finished for good!!!! NO MORE STUDYING...until next semester, that is! 
  
So how did I spend my first day "relaxing"? I went shopping and found *the* perfect winter jacket that defined me - bright, pink fuscia (my absolute fave color), 3/4 lengths long, and with an asymmetrical, bidirectional zipper (dominated the left side of the jacket )...and I know I paid *too* much for it...but I *had* to have it! (I know, it was an impulse buy...but hey, I know I'll wear it enough to make the money's worth). 
  
I also went to university to work out (I guess I can't stay away from school!) and then went to the kids' karate grading tonight to help out. Also started reading a bit of the  Banana Boys  book. 
  It was a good, relaxing day.

   Happy 1st Anniversary, RADS DIGITIZED!  
  
Ok, so I'm a few days late...the first posting was written on Dec. 4, 2002.  Dan's managed to post about four times this year...wow! Ok, well I guess it's not really his thing. There will be more posts from him when he goes on his trip to Australia and New Zealand at the end of this month (*sob*).   

I enjoy writing in this blog because it allows me to share my thoughts and feelings, although, I know I don't get as personal as I could. Would people want that? A goal I'd like to make for this coming year is to enhance my photography in quantity and quality. I'd like to take pictures of unusual things or try to see the beauty in "ordinary" everyday objects/places/things. I still think my favorites are pictures of people because it is people that make photos interesting, especially when the pictures are taken "in a moment" and not "posed". 
  Thanks for supporting the site by coming to read it...now, if people would post comments more often, I'd like that more (hint hint)! ;) Let me know what you guys would want to see/read more of! Thanks!

      It's 11:30pm right now...I'm taking a study break, damnit! My eyes feel so dry and I feel soooo sleepy.   
 Things I cannot wait to do when I am done finals:    
*Read a novel or two -  Banana Boys , which Q lent to me, and  Black Like Me , which is a true story about a white man who turns himself into a Black man and lives as one for the rest of his life in the 1940's; a time when Whites were extremely racist against Blacks.   
*Go through photos that I want to frame and put them up in my room
  
*Christmas shopping and making of presents!  
Three more days and I'm a free woman...for about a month!!!! What are you doing over the holidays?

      I had a great day today...  
 11:00AM-12:30PM   Worked out at the university gym. Oops...ate too much for breakfast and feeling the effects as I'm doing my ab workout. Not too cool that I am feeling "bloated" either. 

  
  1:00-6:00PM   Studied in Cameron Library...man! I can't believe I was in there for 5 hours straight!!!! And no, I didn't talk to anyone...I actually studied the whole time.
   
 4:30PM   Quang calls me to invite me to a Roger's AT & T Promo party at Shanks (sports pub)...free food and drinks! I'm definitely game!!! He tells me he'll pick me up at around 6:30. 
  
  7PM  Q and I stuff our faces with appetizers and burritos. I accidentally overload my 2 burritos...so much that there was enough stuffing for FOUR burritos. Whoops.
  
 8:45-10PM  Visited Q's cousins, which also happens to be my neighbours 2 doors down. 
  
 10:30-11:30PM  Gabbed on the phone with Jenn. Told her about my freaky dream I had last night, about her being pregnant. The scary part was that her embryo was  sticking out  of her stomach, so that you could see the mold of the baby's features (eyes, mouth, fingers, toes, etc.) and she had to  hold  the embryo (her stomach) while she walked around or else it would have been banging against her crotch! 
  
The even weirder part? She told me that we must have some sort of connection (well we are best friends!) because she was feeling like she was pregnant this week, since she ate non-stop. 
  
Not spooked yet? About two summers ago, while Jenn was in France, I broke up with my then-boyfriend, Trevor. Jenn had no way of knowing this or any of the problems leading up to the break up. She had a dream that same week about us breaking up. Strange, huh?

      Today is mine and Dan's one year, 6 months anniversary, and so we went on a rock-climbing "date". It was fun, but I was a bit disappointed in myself. I thought I would do better for my first time, but I didn't know how to do it properly and the dude supervising wasn't much help. 
  
We only have 1/2 an hour to climb because the place was closing up. I don't know how I would ever be able to climb for an hour or more anyways...my arms were killing me. 
  Well, then I find out that you're suppose to use your LEGS mostly to help you climb...whoops! I was using mostly my arms. No wonder they got tired fast.
  
Then we went for Chinese food. It was greasy...but good!
  
ONE more day left of school...whoo-hoo!

       For almost the last week, I have been tramping (Kiwi for hiking) along the Abel Tasman Costal Track.  Simply put...It has been amazing!  Up and down mountain sides, along beaches, all while coordinating walking times with the low tides in the estuaries (or else I would not be able to cross).  I actually did the track the opposite way as to what's recommended, but I think it was far better as the scenery only got better and better every day.  Had I done it the normal direction, I feel as though it would have been somewhat of an anti-climax.    

Anyhow, 5 days and numerous blisters later, I now site at the base of Franz Joseph glacier, the closest glacier to the equator.  Though not too unlike glaciers in Alberta, I just got back from a walk through an abandoned tunnel where glow-worms live and light up the ceiling as you walk underneath.    
 
Tomorrow it's off to Fox glacier, which is supposed to have some unbelieveable scenery, afterwhich I will hitch to Te Anau, where the Kepler track begins (a mountainous 3 night/4 day hike).  
 
Talk to ya in a few days.!

       New photos up from Dan's Trip!    These are definitely the best ones yet!!!! Dan went travelling with a Korean companion, Chong, and they went to check out the Te Papa museum, which seems to have alot of interactive displays and attractions! Some are quite funny! Also, Dan went flying and the scenery is breath taking. See them  urlLink here  and  urlLink  here !

       Isn't it Ironic?   So you know that $1000 I won? Guess where it's going? To pay my deductible on my insurance.  
Michelle and I were on our way to go tanning. I was making a left turn at an intersection when my car hit ice and the brakes locked up and I couldn't even swerve to avoid the truck in front of me. Total damage to the front of my car. At least the driver of the truck was a nice guy (so far...we'll see if he claims "whiplash" later), and he even let Miche and I sit in his truck to warm up, while we waited for the police and the tow truck guy to show up. Of course, a sandtruck happened to drive by JUST after the accident happened! Real nice timing to rub it in.
  
A cop car happened to be driving by (not for our accident scene) and told us to drive to the police station 1.5 blocks away. One of the cops drove my car to there and from there, we filed a report. My parents came to meet me there, peeved of course. My dad was so upset, saying this was the fourth accident for me.   
Excuse-me -FOURTH!?!?!?!?   
Ok, this is my FIRST major accident. Two of them did not involve anyone else - my first "accident", I went into a ditch on a country road in winter, and my "third" accident involved me scraping the side of my car a bit to avoid a parked car behind me. The "second" accident, involved a girl opening HER car door into MY PARKED car - and somehow my parents figure that this is still partly my fault. They claim I could have parked somewhere else...but hello? How was I suppose to predict this was going to happen? Irrational, I tell ya!   
I handled the accident pretty well, I did not freak out or get upset. Shit happens right? I'm most upset about my parents' attitudes. They are totally rubbing it in my face, telling me that they always warned me that I drive too fast (I am not that bad! No worse than 10km over the speed limit). Well I can guarantee I will not live this down for as least the next 5 years. My mom will bring it up in our next argument we have, even if it has nothing to do with our fight. I just know it, because this is how irrational my mom is. Surprisingly, my dad was more of the jerk this time around (usually, he's pretty rational about things like this). But I feel my relationship with my father has been getting more distant this past year. He just seems more quiet towards me now. I use to be "daddy's little girl", but I don't know why that changed. It's upsetting really, but I feel my dad and I have nothing in common anymore.   
Isn't it ironic that I win $1000 and then I get into an accident? It's an "Even Steven" situation, I tell ya! Oh well, I'm just thankful that nothing serious happened to anyone. A lot worse things could have happened.

      It's 11:30pm, Saturday night and I'm taking a break from writing my philosophy paper.   
So...since I'm trying to get in bikini shape (i.e., cutting down on carbs) for Peurto Vallarta, lately I've been addicted to milkshakes.   
Every morning, I experiment in making a different kind. I'll throw in various mixes of yogurt, soy milk, 1% milk, chocolate milk, almond bits, various fruits, peanut butter, ice, cottage cheese, vanilla extract and cocoa powder. Not all at once of course- but a different mix of some each day.   
Well, last week, mom had put all the bananas we had left into the freezer because they were getting super ripe (I'm talking to the point that they were black!). I usually defrost 1-2 bananas the night before and they are ready to go in the morning. Well, one particular morning, I had forgot to defrost the bananas the night before, so I ended up putting one in the microwave.   
Whoops.  
The banana ended up almost catching on fire (the stem had ember on it) and the whole microwave was smoking, not to mention that I stunk up the whole kitchen after that.   
Well, out of desperation and love for bananas in my milkshake, I ended up using the banana.   
Big mistake!   
It totally ruined the drink. It was as if I was eating the smell of electricity, if that makes any sense. It was so disgusting! I didn't have time to make another one, so I was forced to finish the rest. Blech! Fortunately, I didn't get sick.   
Out of all the milkshakes I've created, this one's my fave. I call it the...
 Peanut-Butter & Chocolate Shake   
 You need:   
1/2 cup chocolate milk 
1/2 cup white milk 
2 bananas 
1 heaping spoon of peanut butter 
1 tsp vanilla extrat 
option: ice  
option 2: add kalua or irish cream (of course I don't do this before school!)  

Blend together in blender, putting in on the "whip" option for 1 minute.  
Serving: 1, but it makes about 2.5 cups and is quite filling. Mmmm-mmm!  


All this talk about milkshakes and now I'm craving one.

        Last Wednesday, I was walking through Quad (an outside area at University) and there were some guys casually playing football, as a way to draw attention to the U of A Athletics Club (I think). Anyways, there was a draw for $1000 put on by the university Atheletics and some free hot chocolate (that's always good on a semi-cold winter day!). However, I was already late in meeting a professor, so I had decided to put my name in the draw after, which was closing in 45 minutes. But I mean even if I did put my name in the draw, not like I'd win or anything....  
Luckily, my meeting with my prof was brief and I was out of there in about 10 minutes. I made my way back to Quad, and put my name in the draw and got myself some nice hot chocolate (which was pretty much running out at this point).   
Well today, I get this call from the President of the University Athletics - and guess what!? 
  Guess what!?!?!?   I WON!   I actually won the $1000!!!!!! I was so stoked and I'm still in disbelief. I am suppose to meet the president so he can give me a cheque on Monday. I hope there's not catch to this- but even if there was, I'd probably do it anyway! Whoo-hoo! I still can't believe it -and I probably won't until I get the cheque in my hands! Wow! Insane! I've never won money before! Hmm...maybe my next mission is to purchase a Lotto 649 ticket! (Ok, I won't push my luck)!   
Yesterday was Chinese New Year! I think the monkey has brought me prosperity right on time!

       Hello from the USA   
 "What's that crazy Dan talking about?" you ask...well, it sure seems like I'm in America as I'm sitting amongst Californian Red Wood trees, eating a Californian Orange, and staying in a city called "Vegas".   
 
"Vegas" - The official name is Rotorura, but being the busiest tourist city in New Zealand, the local Kiwis call it "Roto-Vegas".   
 
Californian Oranges - tthese imported fruits are even cheaper than domestic varieties, including Kiwifruit!!!  
 
Californian Red Woods - these trees were imported here before WWII in an experiment to find a suitable replacement for the slow growing natives trees of New Zealand.    
 
On top of that, I was staying at a Mexican-themed hostel...can you say "identity crisis?"  
 
Anyways, I'm actually now in Wellington, the capital of the country, with a population of about 200,000.  The weather has been miserable...windy, rainy, and very cold...I had to buy a fleece jacket yesterday.  Unfortunately, due to the weather, I was forced to forego the Tongariro Crossing, billed as being the "Finest One Day Walk in the World".  I do that next time!  Tomorrow I'll be going to the premier museum of the country, Te Papa, which is only a few years old and has displays from everything ranging from pre-historic times to traditional Maori culture and the future of the country.  In addition (weather permitting), I'll visit the controversial "Beehive" (parliamentary buildings) and will make the short climb to the top of Mt. Victoria to get a good view of the city.  The next day, I'll be taking a scenic flight over to the south island, where I will commence on the 4-day trek through the Able Tasman National Park.  
 
The last few days have been filled with a variety of activities, primarily, the Matiki Maori Village.  Though obviously a tourist-made village, we witnessed Maori (native New Zealanders) dances, cultural displays, and combat techniques, all before the Hangi - a feast cook in an earth-oven.  The performances were extremely well done and there was never a dull moment throughout the evening.  The next day I saw some 140 degree mud pits and geyers, though they were nothing too grand compared to those in Yellowstone.  I finally met some Edmontonian...a guy from Leduc and a girl from my community, Duggan!    
 
Whilst storlling along the shore of Lake Taupo (Central north island), I saw a peaceful and picturesque island with many types of birds on it.  I approaced for a better picture, but as I emerged from the trees, one angered sea gull sounded the alarm, lunged up in the air, and took a few swoops at me.  The only way I had to defend myself was to hurtle some sand from the beach while I ran back to the cover of the forest - and I was told that New Zealand had no natural predators....=-(    
 
  (Side note from Roz: Ahhhh!!!! I hope my camera is okay!!!!)     
Well, the next few days should be clearing up a bit, but even the local Kiwis have told me that this has been abnormally cold for this time of year.  I already miss the hot beaches of Australia.  On the other hand, I looked at the weather report, and the north east coast of Oz has had nothing but rain for the past few days.    
 
It may be a week before I send off my next email as I will not have access while on the Able Tasman Track, but don't worry, I'll stay away from the sea gulls!

      Joe's Wine and Dine potluck hall party on Saturday night was a blast! Joe is going away in a couple months to live in Peru for a couple years. The main reason for going? Patricia, his girlfriend (whom was here as an exchange student at the U of A last year). Isn't that romantic? Awwwwww! That's amour!
   Anyways, I haven't had that much fun in a long time, and I haven't been drunk in a long time either! It was nice to see people I haven't seen in a while. Since Joe is Dan's friend, it was mostly Dan's friends who were at the party. George, Dan's best friend, was my date -- and boy, he makes one hell of a fun date!   
The way that Joe's party worked was that each person received a bottle of wine from a certain country, and we got to wear name tags with the country that our wine was from written underneath our names. We were free to mingle, trade, share, test wines with others. I hadn't ate in a few hours, so the effect of the wine was taking toll over me quick!   
Joe had tealight candles everywhere on the tables, and things at our table managed to flame up a bit not once...but twice! I think in total, there were three mini fire starters the whole party. It was actually really funny...since nothing burned down. 
  
There was awesome food, some fun battle of the sexes games and bad kareoke singing goin' on. Afterwards, some of us went to the Attick to party the rest of the night. Georgie is my fave dancing partner (sorry Dan!) - we're going to be clubbing buddies from now on! 
  Some losers wanted to start a fight with some of the guys in our group over a pool game- A POOL GAME!!!! C'mon, get a life! They were 18 year old punks anyways. I was so ready to step in to stop the fight, if it had started, but our group of guys were smart enough to not evoke anything more. So our group decided to head out to another bar. On our way out, some cute guy smiled at me and said to his female friend beside him, "That girl is SO hot". It was very obvious and I was flattered, but I was more concerned with jumping those losers who were trying to start a fight if they had tried anything. Fortunately, nothing did happen.
  It was an awesome night...I think the only thing that would have made it more awesome was if my Daniel was there. Being around his friends made me miss him even more.  *sigh*

       Dan reports from Auckland:  
   

   Well, much has happened in the last few days.
   
Yesterday, I arrived in Auckland, New Zealand from Brisbane, Australia.  Tired, hungry, and jet lagged, I immediately headed for the bar for the free pizza with a beer purchase.  Upon getting there, I met a guy from Holland (lots of Europeans here) and then we met 6 guys from Christchurch, NZ and I also met a guy from St. Albert and one from Yellowknife.  We all teamed up in the Goldfish Olympics (yes, I did just say Goldfish), and although our little guy, Fin, didn't do to well, we did get a free bar tab for cheering the loudest.  We later headed to another pub, with $2 beers, met 4 girls from Wellington, NZ, another guy from Toronto, and another girl from the UK.  All in all, I got pizza, 6 beers, and met tons of people all for $6 (about $5 canadian)...not too bad.  Auckland is a bit larger than Edmonton, but is much more developed, however, it doesn't have the hustle of larger cities like Sydney.  It's very nice here, but I will be moving on come Sunday.  
   
The day before in Brisbane, I was able to pet and walk amongst a herd of 40 Kangaroos (little did they know that only a few hours earlier I was chomping down on a 'Roo burger - yummy!).  I also got to see Tasmanian Devils, Wallabies, various lizards and birds, and Koalas (who get very fiesty at feeding time) and giant bats (or Flying Foxes, as the Ozzies call them).  I love the fact that Geckos roam freely just about everywhere and nobody seems to care.  
   
For the days preceeding that, I was on Fraser Island, a magnificent place that merges sea with sand dune with rainforest.  We (10 people, besides myself), got a 4x4 toyota landcruiser to drive either on the beach or on the unpaved trails of the forest.  At night, we set up camp virtually anywhere we like.  I guess Europeans don't do much camping cuz it took Sue (another Canadian) and I about a quarter of the time to set up our tents.  The island was remarkable, definately the highlight of my time in Oz!   
 
From Sydney to Fraser Island, I drove up with a girl from Germany who was driving around Australia.  We made stops in the surfing paradise of Byron Bay, the beautiful sea-side parks of Noosa Heads, and the amazine city of Port Macquerie.  We saw lots of beaches and picked up several other backpackers - one from Germany, one from Austria, and two from California (the only Americans that I've met).    
 
Tomorrow I'm going to see my company's (Aon Reed Stenhouse) office here in Auckland.  After that I'm heading out to "Big Day Out", which is about the only major concert that New Zealand gets every year.  It should be amazing...Metallica, Basement Jaxx, AphexTwin, the Strokes, and MANY more.  For those who are interesed, check out the  urlLink site    
Should be a blast!   
 
I hope that all is going well for everyone else.

      Ok, I admit it, I am guilty. I have a crush on a "new" man. Every since watching   Pirates of the Carribean , which I saw for the first time (FINALLY!) on Sunday at Q's house, I developed somewhat of  tiny  thing for  urlLink Orlando Bloom .  
   He really didn't do anything for me in Lord of The Rings, as  urlLink Legolas , since I thought he was almost too pretty (in a feminine way) and I'm sure it was because of the hair. Alright, I don't think this is going to turn into anything remotely close to the teeny bop obsession I have with Keanu Reeves...but I just happened to be surfing the internet and came across several Orlando Bloom sites, you know, by accident. It turns out that today is his birthday (he's only 27 years old, if anyone cares).    I didn't realize that he was also in Black Hawk Down. Cool. Anyway, his eyes mesmerize me. Oh, he has sexy hair too.

       Life Sucks when...   
(the following stories are true incidents,  not  commited by yours truly)
   Story A: ...you're a sucka! When you work for a truck company as a trucker who transports products from city to city and receive pay under the table. The problem? You aren't smart enough to figure out that the company is ripping you off when you only get paid $100 (if lucky enough to even get that much) for 12 hours of work (pay by the load, not by hour). Well, in this case, this person  knew  he was getting ripped off and still did not do anything about it, but continued to work for this shitty company  (mistake #1) . 
  It gets worse...  
One day you drive to Calgary then back to Edmonton, and then you drive to  Red Deer (with your own vehicle- which then breaks down on the way back to Edmonton).  
 Now that sucks...   
It gets worse...  
You then demand the company should pay for your car repairs, since it's the least they could do if they underpay you what your work's really worth. The company tells you that they will get back to you  (mistake #2 - you should never back down until you get your money right then and there!) . A few days later ( mistake #3 - should have gone in RIGHT AWAY) , when you go to demand for money at the truck station, absolutely  everything  is gone. The truck station is empty! Bankrupt!   
So you never got your pay from your last Edmonton-Calgary and Edmonton-Red Deer job -- and on top of that, money to get your car repaired!!!!  Sucka!   
 Story B: ...when you have a crappy Christmas (we're talking, a lump of coal or a room full of cow manuer would have been much better than what this poor dude went through).   
So you go to Australia to visit some relatives for Christmas...not so bad right? Well, on Christmas Day, you discover absolutely  no one  had bothered to give you any presents, so you're forced to sit through the whole Christmas gift opening watching others all around you open their gifts.  Awwww. 
  It gets worse...  
Later that week, you walk into your so-called fiance giving oral sex to another guy while they are in a carwash drive.  (Side note: don't ask me how this guy walked into a carwash!)   
It gets worse...  
Then you develop a severe lung infection and spend the rest of your christmas in a hospital in Australia. The worst part? None of your relatives come visit you at all!  
I don't know what this guy did to deserve all this, but man, I think we can all stop complaining about how much our life sucks when we're feeling our worse! Unlike Story A, which was totally preventable, Story B could not do anything about the events that unfolded before him. Now that sucks.

         In the early morning, Michelle and Roz take the Edmonton transit bus downtown to the travel agency. They are about to book their trip to Peurto Vallarta, in which, Michelle was informed the night before, that only two more spots are available.   
Upon arrival, a travel agent takes them in and asks how she can help. Michelle and Roz eagerly tell her they want to book a trip for reading week to Peurto Vallarta. The agent searches on her computer...turns to them and says, "I'm sorry, the last two spots were purchased at 4pm last night". Michelle's and Roz's eyes bulge out.   Nooooo!!!!!   
Just then, like a miracle that happens once in a lifetime, another travel agent walks by and takes notice of our conversation. She then corrects the other agent, "Actually, there ARE two more spots available, I put them aside".  It turned out that the 2nd travel agent was the one Michelle had spoken to the day before and she had, unbeknownst to us, put aside the two spots for us. What an angel! Michelle and Roz were estatic!!! 
  This all inclusive trip includes: flight, hotel, buffet breakfast, all lunches and dinner, room service, snacks, UNLIMITED drinks, daily activities, theme parties, nightly entertainment, water sports, 1 cruise (show, meal, OPEN BAR), and introductory snorkelling and scuba-diving lessons!!!!   
The count-down begins! Meanwhile...it's time to get into bikini-body shape!   
Oh yeah, the 2nd travelling agent, which also happens to be our tour guide, also informed Michelle and Roz that it will be a fun group...lots of guys! Whoo-hoo! Uh - not that that should matter, of course....*wink*
  
 Side note: My mom told me  not  to get drunk when I'm down in Mexico (har har, mother! That's not likely)! She told me how she was watching some show, maybe the news, not sure-  about students in Mexico, and how drunk girls are running around topless and out of control - like it's a "new" thing to her. (Hey...that sounds kind of like the house boat trip...but I won't let mom know that). Boy, maybe I should let her know this is probably a common ordeal in Mexico, especially among college students, just to freak her out. I wonder how mom would react to the movie, "Cancun"?  Mom, getting drunk does  not always  equal nudity...just only 80% of the time (in one way or another). That's why Michelle will be there to keep me in line, right Miche? Har har, I'm just kidding, I will behave!   ;o)

      Man, it is WAY TO COLD outside!!!! I'm even more jealous of Dan now, who is probably in plus 30 degrees whether, while we're all suffering here in minus 30! Hmph!   
So first day of the new semester today, and it was ...odd. It was odd because I'm in my final year and taking two introductory courses, Philosophy 102 (Knowledge and Reality), where we discuss/debate issues on if God really exists, free will, determinism, religion, etc. and Sociology 271 (Family). It's odd because I'm back in big classes with people that generally are much younger than me, so I'm probably a "fogie" in that class.   

Unlike Philosophy 101, I think Phil 102 class will be somewhat interesting. I took Phil 101 in my first year, thinking it was going to be so cool, but it turned out to be a total snore. Anyways, the policy at university is that if you take phil 101 you MUST take 102. However, over the course of my schooling, I heard rumors that the school was looking into changing that, so for 3 years I tried to avoid Phil 102. Unfortunately, it must have been just a rumor, and I MUST take 102 in order to graduate...so here I am. The prof is totally gay, he has this super heavy lisp and it's very distracting. Also, when he talks, his voice tends to crescendo, so it's extremely hard to understand him.  
The second class I have is Sociology 271 (Family), which is pretty self-explanatory. The prof seems a bit of a machine though, with minimal personality. She did not engage in eye contact with the class when she was barking (that's right, barking) out the syllabus to us. Strange woman, but I think the course will be straight forward.

       Reflections:   
*After other friends shared their "trip with friends" experiences, I learned that it is typical for the relationship to change negatively after the trip. I talked to three other girl friends about their experiences and in every situation, it turned out for the worse...to the point where they do not talk to the former best friend anymore these days. My last ski trip experience has definitely changed my outlook on my friendship with Jenn, but I don't think we'll stop talking to each other. I just cannot be sure if we can ever be "best friends" again, but I am sure we will stay friends. 
  
*On that note...Michelle and I are to take a trip together to somewhere hot for reading week...and I'm thinking this may not be such a good idea. What if it turns out horrible as well, and I lose my best friend?! *gulp* I am actually quite nervous the more I think about it. I think maybe if we set some rules before we go, it will be okay...I hope? I know we have some different styles but not sure how so when it comes to travelling. I'm thinking we should discuss our "styles" before we decide to go.  Any other suggestions?
  
*On another note, I discovered this really great album called " urlLink Eighteenth Street Lounge Soundtracks ". I love 

 urlLink Thievery Corporation,  and the beats on both albums are quite comparable.   
*I have a four-hour spare ever Wednesdays this semester (taking a night class for the first time- NOT by choice since this was the only time slot for this particular class)! So to kill time, I decided to take a pilates class. Simultaneously, this may help solve issues I have with (my) "Belly". I'm very excited about this!

      Yesterday, I met up with my friend Cory, his (new) girlfriend Charlotte and his roomate, Chris at West Ed Mall. They had all came up from Calgary for the day. We shopped for a bit, then went to Dante's for dinner and afterwards, to the bar at Dante's.
   I must say, I was quite impressed with the some of the small changes they made to the bar. Sections were renovated and redecorated (except I didn't like how they compensated some dance floor space in place of a DJ booth) and the upstairs had expanded so that it was  like  an entirely different bar upstairs from downstairs. Char and I had not discovered that they played house music upstairs (this never use to be the case, it was just a private room for functions) until about 1am-ish, and the sweetest part was that there was a huge fish acquarium behind the bartenders' space.   Oooh, how I longed for my camera that night!    
Dante's is a place geared towards a mature crowd (late 20's- 30's), but judging by the House music in the bar upstairs, I'm guessing they are trying to cater to the younger crowd as well. 
  The funniest part about last night was when Char and I were upstairs, we were watching these two ladies, both about late 20's to early 30's, and some totally nasty European 80's wanna-be dude (He was wearing a long shag closely cropped to his head, tight black tee tucked into his tapered blue jeans - think a really ugly version of Tony Danza) - all swaying and grinding together to the beat of the music, as if they were in some cheesy 80's porno.  Oooh, how I *really* longed for my camera then!  I don't know if they were high or just really drunk...maybe both! 
Just kind of funny to see older people act like 18 year olds. Oh god, I hope I never become like that!

       A report from Dan in Australia:    
 Hello all,   
 
I just went on the most amazing walk through the Blue Mountains.  I had to get up really early (about 6am), but it was well worth it.  I was walking on the sides of cliffs, through 400 ft waterfalls (don't worry Fu, your camera is safe), and up and down steep stairs (I probably did about 1000 stairs today).  I have some amazing pictures, but it harder than I thought to get them off the digital camera and onto the website.  If and when this finally happens, I'll let you know.  
   
Yesterday I travelled by train from Sydney to Katoomba (Blue Mountains).  It was good to have a chilled days after all the partying on Bondi Beach for new year's.  Dwayne and I met tons of people, mostly Australians, but also some Kiwis (New Zealand) and lots of Brits as well.  Some of the Aucklanders actually invited me to their home when I got over there, unfortunately we got split up before I could get their contact info.  We tried to get into a club, but the cover charge was $100!!!! Crazy!
   
Hawaii was great, and surprisingly inexpensive.  I ran up (where I could) Diamond head crater and got a glorious view of Honolulu.  Everyone, from bus drivers to sales people, was extremely friendly.    
 
Anyhow, tomorrow I'm returning to Sydney to meet up with Kris.  We'll be taking a toyota landcruiser from Sydney to Brisbane, with many stops along the way.  I think that once I get to Brisbane and Fraser Island, I'll head over to NZ.    
 
For those who are concerned, I've had no problems whatsoever, except for losing one of my hats, my blue socks, and my NZ travel info.  Fortunately, expecting something like that to happen, I emailed it to myself so all is not lost (I'm so smart, aren't I!!!).  Buses and transportation is more expensive than I thought, but groceries aren't too bad.    
 
Well, being on my own is fun, but I really do miss you guys.  I hope you're enjoying your weather, as it is abuot 30 degrees here.    
 
Much love to all,  
 
Dan

      (Roz) New Year's Eve was a nice time. Michelle and I headed over to Quang's shindig hot pot dinner party first and mingled with his friends. We then headed over to Christy's where our close group of friends were getting together for a night 'o drinking games. One game was called "Hanky Panky" and involved one person to be blindfolded, while one of the others in the group had to spank him/her. The person then had to guess who spanked them, and everytime they guessed wrong, they had to take a drink and go thru the torture (or pleasure??!)  of being spanked again. Such a simple game...yet  so  amusing. It was a great time!
  
Today, I spent the afternoon watching "Chicago" (WICKED MOVIE- go rent it if you haven't seen it yet) and "XX/XY" (Independent film) at  urlLink Kelly's  house. Since Kelly went to high school with Dan (this is how I met her), I asked to see some geeky old pictures of Dan in her photoalbums. There were lots of funny pictures, but the topper was when I flipped to one group shot in which a girl who was one of my Supervisors (until a couple months ago) at work. I complained to Kel how she was on a power trip and a real bossy bitch. Kel laughed and said that she had to tell me something later when I got to her next photoalbum. 
  So when I opened the next album, I'm casually flipping through the pages, checking out each picture. SUDDENLY... *my eyes open wide* ...there I see a picture of DAN AND MY (ex) SUPERVISOR making out on New Year's 2000 in a bar!!!!!! I had remembered Dan telling me about him making out with a girl all night that new year's, but he did not pursued anything more after that night with her. This is also a girl who worked with one of the kids I work with now before she became a supervisor...what a SMALL world!!!! She is probably between the 10th-15th mutual connection Dan and I have. 
  The funny thing is, I had told Dan about this supervisor of mine a while ago(name and all) - we'll call her Leah - but we both did not realize that it had been the SAME girl that he had made out with during new year's millenium. He probably didn't know her last name anyways, and I probably had not bothered to mention her last name either. 
  Kel had told me that Dan was so embarassed about the picture of them making out, that he had demanded that the picture NEVER be shown to him. He had learned that Leah was a bit slutty, and that probably turned him off from pursuing anything more (I'm assuming- but I cannot confirm this since D's not here). The image of Leah being slutty is super odd to me, since she's a cute, overweight girl (not your typical heavily caked-on make-up, blond, trashy type of slut). 
   I wonder if I dare to bring up her New Year's 2000? The look on her face will be priceless when she learns Dan is my boyfriend. Heh Heh.

      Tired, exhausted and ill from seven straight days of partying and drinking right now...but damn...it was ALL worth it!!! Puerto Vallarta was the BEST time of my life! It was super hard coming back and it's going to be difficult to get back into school mode.  *sigh*   
    

 The following is a brief summary of each day, including links to the photos. Each photo has a description at the bottom, so be sure to read them!    
 Day 1 in Mexico   
We deparated at 2:35pm Edmonton time, and arrived in Mexico 4.5 hours later. The flight was a rowdy one, with mostly people 18-22 years old. Alot of the people looked quite younger though! While waiting at the airport, we met Jen, Mel and Christy, 2 Edmontonian girls in the same all inclusive tour that we were on.   
Our hotel was called "The Getaway Club", which was located about central Puerto Vallarta. We had to stand in line in the hotel lobby for what seemed like an hour, waiting to check in. That was not fun, especially since all Miche and I wanted to do was go change and start drinking...which we did asap.   
Having been a long day, tired from the flight and eating no supper, the few drinks that we had did not take long to kick in.   
Michelle and I met a group of Italian (and Greek) guys from Toronto. They had just arrived that day as well. We ended up hanging out with them quite a bit for the rest of the week.   
All of us went to a bar called Carlos O'Briens to party, where I can hardly recall much, except that Michelle was holding my hair back as I was vomitting into the toilet at the bar. It was bad news. Michelle was hammered too, but not as much as I was. She was wiping my mouth at one point, and my nose ring fell into the toilet. Not like I could find it, and if I could, not like I would wear it again. Ewww!   
As we  were leaving the bathroom, out of nowhere, this Mexican dude helps me to stagger out of the bar. I had NEVER EVER felt that drunk in my life...I wanted to pass out so bad right then and there. The mexican guy was literally holding me up as I was going down the stairs. My body was practically parallel to the floor! He ended up coming into the cab with Miche and I, paying for it, and helped us get up the stairs to our hotel room. Miche paid him and he left.   
I took out my contacts, tried to put in another nose stud (aren't I such a smart girl for bringing extras?) but that one fell into the sink.   Shit.  So then I closed the sink, and then put in my second last nose ring. Success. Then I passed out onto my bed.   
The next morning, Miche and I woke up and luckily, we slept in separate beds because we were both sleeping in our own vomit! It was all over the sheets and our clothes and Miche managed to get some at the end of her bed. I don't know how.  We called housekeeping, but felt really bad and tried to clean up some ourselves.   
  urlLink See Day 1 photos here!   
 Day 2   
Michelle and I got up, and had breakfast, then toured around the local area, but nothing was opened really. We headed back to to resort and walked down the beach. At night, we went to Carlos O'Briens (again). This time, we were smart enough not to get too retarded with the drinking.   

 urlLink See Day 2 pix here!    
 Day 3   
I went shopping with Mel, Christy and Jen to downtown PV. Of course, greedy me, I bought some clothes for myself - souvinir shopping could wait!   
At night, we went to a foam party at  "The Collage" night club. It was my first foam party ever. Unfortunately, I didn't take my camera b/c I knew it would get ruined in the big "bubble bath" party. Bodies rubbin' against bodies.  It was a great time, despite the foam getting into my mouth and eyes. It ended up making my clothes stink too, but the party was well worth it.   
Poor Michelle though, she ended up getting rashes on her feet, which made them swell. Her toes looked like little pigs...awwww.   
 urlLink  See Day 3 pictures here!   
 Day 4   
The highlight of my day was getting my hair braided. I bargained it down from $350 pescos to $300, but I ended up giving the lady $400 pescos (about $40 US) because she did a great job and it took her 2 hours to do my hair. This is the way she makes a living, I think I can afford to give away 10 extra bucks. Bargaining is fun though!   
At night, I went to Senior Frogs with the Italian guys, then we got bored and went to Carlos. We walked in just in time for the wet t-shirt contest...although I assure you the girls were not wearing much of t-shirts. The Italian guys headed back to the resort not long after, but Dan and I stayed and danced, then we walked home and went to the beach. We saw two people having sex on the beach, and four mexican workers were poking their heads out of a nearby building watching. It was hilarious.   
 urlLink View Day 4 pix here!   
 Day 5   
Our tour group went on a "Booze Cruise", which wasn't much of one since it wasn't wild. It was more like a family cruise. There was whale watching, snorkeling, and relaxing on a beach.   
At night, we went on a "Canada Kicks Ass" pubcrawl to 4 different bars. That was a wicked time! Again, being the party animal that I am, I stayed behind and danced while the girls left. I met Jonah, a cool guy from Calgary, and we ended up walking back to the resort together.   
  urlLink View Day 5 Pix here   

 Day 6   
Michelle's feet were feeling better, so we did some shopping and this time, I bought some souvinirs for others. At night, we went to "The Collage" where there was a Mardi Gras theme. We didn't end up staying there too long because Chrystal, Ashley, Kat, me and Michelle wanted to go skinny dipping in the pool back at The Getaway.   
Unfortunately, when we got there, there were about 20 other people there as well, who wanted to skinny dip. Word must have caught on, and the security guard got there right before any action proceeded. Michelle didn't care and just jumped into the pool with her nice dress on. I was laughing so hard - i fogot to get a pic of that!!! I hadn't seen Michelle  that  hammered before!   
We all tried to stay up all night since we had to be up at 5:00AM anyways, but Miche and I couldn't do it and we crashed for about an hour.   
 urlLink See Day 6 Pix here!   
 Day 7   
Boooo! Last day in Mexico...we were all so tired, cranky, bitchy...the plane ride was a quiet one, as most people were passed out. Kurt, the guy sitting beside me, made Miche and I a little nervous since he was holding a vomit bag in his hands the whole time. Luckily, he never had to use it!

      Ok, so you know how I've been working out hardcore and cutting back on the carbs? Well, it's finally all paying off...because people are taking notice of the changes!   
These past couple weeks have been a bit interesting in terms of the compliments and attention I've been getting about my figure. I've had a couple people tell me how hard my arms feel, and yesterday, another girl come up to me at the gym, telling me how toned I was! (That's like the best compliment!) She wanted advice on how I got so toned. Also, I bumped into a friend I hadn't talked to in awhile in the locker room, and she was commenting on how I looked like I lost weight and looked more toned.   
Even though I've been cutting down on carbs, and I did lose a few pounds, you know what I think the ultimate secret is?   
Tanning. That's right...fake and baking.   
I've been tanning to get a base for my Mexico trip. I know that tanning brings out definition of the body even more, so this may be part of the reason why I look more toned. Whatever works!   
I have no idea if these next two incidents are related to these "changes", but last week, some guy came up to me in the gym and introduced himself to me. Just like that. Then today, another guy (he was super cute too!) introduced himself to me and asked me out! Now that's BOLD! Of course I had to turn him down, but if I was single, I definitely would have gone on a date with him.   
Perhaps it's just me getting extremely excited about Dan coming back soon and my Mexico trip, that's causing me to have a permanent smile on my face (Oh...wait...I'm always smiling)...but the "ora" I have, must be bringing out certain vibes to others.

      whoops, i got a little lazy, and haven't updated in awhile. Anyway, this is a posting from Dan on Feb. 7th   

 Do I have to come back?   

 

 Kepler Track - This was a 4 day, 66 kilometer mountainous trek, with an elevation gain of over 1200 meters.  Rain on the first day, which consisted of an 800 meter climb into a cloudy mountain side.  The weather cleared for the second, which gave me some great panoramic pictures of the mountain ranges.  Another 400+ meters and I reached the peak of Mt. Luxmore, where I spent a few hours along the ridges between peaks and then the steep descent back to flat land.  Day was was spectacular.  Finally I got a hot day, a day without rain, and a day without sandflies (the first for all three while in NZ).  The hut was located on a very picturesque beach on a tranquil lake surrounded by a showcase of fiords and mountains.  Swimming in the pristine waters was welcomed relief to my sore muscles.  The sunset was unbelievable as sunbeams shot through the clouds until the passing of the final moments of the day.  The fourth day was a generally flat walk through lush green forests, where various mosses outlined the path and stringy ferns dangled from the blackened trees, creating a eerie Lord of the Rings feeling.   I overhead one German tramper state This place is special.  I agree.    


 

Anyhow, Im now back in Queenstown after an adventurous day hitchhiking.  I decided to take a more scenic route back, but this plan backfired as there was very little traffic and I couldnt get a ride for 3 hours (and 15 km of walking).  Just when I was losing faith, I came across a high school aged farm girl who, with her horse Bloke, was checking her mail.  I soon saddled up and got a ride for about 10km or so until the next major intersection.  My next three rides consisted of a couple from England, an older couple from NZ who made me sign their hitchhiker guestbook which they keep in their car, and then 4 young NZ partiers from the north island.  One moment Im with someone whos knitting sweaters and the next Im being offered beers!    


 

By the time you read this, I will have completed everything I set out to do in NZ and Oz.  Tomorrow I will take the Nevis Highwire Bungy jump, which towers at 134 meters (I believe the 2nd highest in the world) and consists of 30 uniquely designed patents used to enhance the thrill factor.    


 

Well, its less than a week away until I return.  Im a little home sick, but spending time in a country where I can still wear shorts outside has many advantages.  Ill be spending one more day in Queenstown (a lovely, yet touristy town similar to Banff), a day in Dunedin, then two in Christchurch before starting my many flights back home.  
  
 
See ya then,  D

      My mom went hardcore on the cooking and baking today - and as of this moment, I am STUFFED. Mom made lasagna with whole wheat noodles, which was the first time I've tried whole wheat noodles. Honestly, I think they taste better than the regular noodles, and plus, it's healthier! I don't feel so bad about eating the carbs either!   
Then mom made blueberry-banana muffins with whole wheat flour (I gotta lot of fiber in me now!) and those were deeeelicious!  Mmm-mmm!    
And for supper we had a juicy turkey, with mashed potatoes, stuffing and bach-choy (Ok, I know I totally spelled that wrong, but you know what I'm talking about). 
   After supper, I couldn't help myself, and I had a Hawaiian-nut chocolate - and right now, I am soooo craving for more (I can't stop picturing myself holding the box of chocolates in my lap, and stuffing my mouth full of them - one after another...ooooh man...how badly I want to do that right now...but I won't.)   
Weird.   
It's probably b/c I've been depriving myself of chocolate lately.  Mmmm. Chocolate....   I swear, I can't stop thinking about that box calling my name. 
  
In other news, 2 midterms down, 2 more midterms and 1 paper to go (for this week anyways). And less than 2 weeks until Dan comes home and I go to Mexico! Whoo-hoo!

      Ok...it's official...I'm addicted to ebay...I actually got Dan to win this dress for me, while he was at work (since I was at school at closing time of the bid). This is my latest winning, thanks to D:   

    

I believe it's quite similar, if not the same, dress that Lucy Liu wore in the first Charlie's Angels movie. I had fell in love with it, and actually designed a dress quite similar to this, got a seamstress to make it and I wore it to my friend Lindsey's wedding last summer. My dress is also an asian print, but it is blue and the hemline of the skirt is assymetrical. I just hope my new purchase looks as good as it does on the model!

      I entered a "New Face for Smirnoff Contest" just for kicks, and I actually made it to the semi-finals round.   

Anyways, I'm asking you guys to do me a favor and vote for me. Please go 

 urlLink here  to vote for me (that is, if you think I deserve to win).
I'm #10. I don't think I'll win, but it's fun anyways :o)   

Thanks for your support!

       Saturday night schedule:   
 7:00pm  Dan and I mix ceasars, finished off a bottle of vodka between the two of us.   
 7:45pm  Walk over to Scruffy Murphys/ Overtime pub, where Jenelle's having a pubcrawl.  
 8:00pm  Drink some more at the pub, socialize with friends.   
 9:00pm  Head over to O'Byrnes, where Dan and I toppled down the stairs and he ended up lying on top of me, in the middle of the bar, making it look like we were ready to get it on right then and there.   
 10pm?  At this point, I'm so drunk, I can really only estimate what time it was. We headed over to the new Druid on the south side - which I can't really recall what it looked like...just remember there were alot of walls, and not a lot of dancing room.   
 10:10pm?  Headed over to the bathroom, where Kelly took care of me while i hugged the porcelin god and hurled my guts out.  (Thanks Kelly! You're a sweetheart!)    
 10 or 11...something?!? Next think I know, Dan's in the (girls) bathroom stall with me...helping me too. Girls were freaking out, wondering what a guy was doing in the bathroom.  A bouncer eventually came in and kicked us out of the bar.     
 Around midnight:  Walked into Dan's place, w/o taking off my boots, and tried to hurl more...but no luck. Took out contacts. Passed out on the bed.   
 6:00am:  Woke up...totally DEHYDRATED, had LOTS of water and a piece of bread with peanut butter on it (mmmmm mmmm). Had some yogurt and bananas too. No hang over! YAY!  
Dan's doing good too!!! He use to be the one who vomits when we go out on drinkfests, but now the roles are reversed!

      I have a new addiction as of late...shopping for unique clothing on Ebay! This is my first purchase that I won in a bidding:  
   
I'm pretty excited about it!

      WHOA. Yeah...it's been awhile, and we're still alive (but not like Dan posts on here anyways).   

SO this is what I've been up to: 
Studying, studying, studying.   

And seriously...that is about it.   

But now I have a small break before I must start studying for finals, so I'm going to shop, shop, shop, drink, shop, go out with friends and shop some more. Ok...maybe not that much shopping, since I don't have that much money. But I'm definitely going to find some new clothes. I'm itching for new clothes.   

Ok, so some random stuff that happened lately:  

My parents found an ad for airline flight attendents. One of the requirements are that you must be bilingual. So my 21-year old brother, who hasn't spoke a word of Chinese (we speak Cantonese) in over 10 years, wants to apply. He understands it quite well because my parents speaks Cantonese to us all the time, but he always responds back in English. The life of a "Banana" (incase some of you don't know what that means...it's a white-washed Chinese person). Anyways, so now my brother's trying to speak more Chinese with my parents so that he can apply for that flight attendant job.   
So today was my mom's bday and he almost forgot until she told him that Dan and I got her a cute sweater and pant set for spring. So he enthusiastically goes, "Oh YEAH!!!! Gong Hay Fa Choy!" - which translates to "Happy New Year!" Hahahha. Good one, Merv! :-P   

     
So yesterday, Dan and I were going through a box of old pictures from his younger days, and this was one of my favorite ones. Carolyn, his older sister, had wrote "Kick me" on his back in mud, and she had told him that she had written something else. So Dan wore it on his back for a while, and apparently, the sun tanned the words into his back. That's priceless!

       APPLYING FOR GRAD SCHOOL   
Application form completed...check.   
Copy of completed application form...check.   
Letter of Intent...check.   
Biographical Account...check.   
A photo of myself...check.   
$60 US admission fee...OOPS.   

What a goof I am! I sent all the required information to apply for grad school, except for the admission fee!!! So tomorrow I'll have to get a money order and send it separately, since the rest of the information is well on it's way to grad school.   
Man, watch me not get accepted just because of this stupid mistake. ACK.

      Just got back home about an hour ago from THE BEST SNOWBOARDING day ever! Amber, my tour guide from my Mexico trip, hooked up the group with one fun ski day at  urlLink Marmot Basin  (Jasper). Dan, Suzy, Stefko, Irene and I all went. Included in the package was round trip transportation, lift tickets, lunch, free beer, and a kokonee toque all for...  

FIVE DOLLARS!!!!! That's right...FIVE DOLLARS!   
Can you believe it!? To top it off, the weather was BEAUTIFUL...except for the random crazy snow-blowing wind, but who can't handle a little snow in the face? It was warm wind too!   
Ah it was too much fun! But it was definitely well deserved, after all the hardcore studying I've been doing for my 3 up-coming midterms this week!

      Argh! Lately, I keep losing things and I do not, for the life of me, know where they are! (I know Dan, you're probably thinking, "What do you mean  lately ?") I was listening to a CD in my car the other day, and I had the case on the passenger seat. The last time I remember seeing it was right before I went to work out, then Dan came and sat on the seat. I haven't seen it since, and I don't suppose he would take Justin Timberlake's CD case...or would he? Hah!   
Then today, I'm showing off my new "old school Top Gun" style sunglasses to Quang, who came by for a surprise visit as I was on my way out to the gym. (Gee, it seems like all I do is work out and lose things, doesn't it?). Anyway, I have no idea what happened to them, as I searched everywhere in my room and other possible places I could have left them. Grrrr! Quang did you take them!? I know you weren't too fond of them, but would it be so weird to think that you and Dan are stealing from me?!

       Week 3 Kinetix Nuitrician Plan   
    
Ok, so no sign of abs yet, but I can  feel  a difference when I wear my pants. I also slacked off a bit (just a wee bit) over the weekend - I probably ate things I shouldn't have, but oh well...I got to have some fun too! I am not sticking 100% to the plan though, since it's suppose to be 40% protein, 40% carbs and 20% fat every meal/snack I have. I up the protein intake (with Isolate protein powder) and I'll sometimes substitute other ingredients in the recipes. But I think that as long as I am  relatively  eating around the same Kcounts as I am suppose to, it should be okay.

      Ok, it's been quite a while since I posted...actually I did post on the 19th, but the entry was deleted b/c blogger was screwy, and I was too lazy to repost. So a quick update:   
 Monday April 19:  Had my grad school interview, it went quite well,  Not too much interesting to talk about here. Managed only to get lost once while driving there (which is about just over an hour to get to). I should know if I've been accepted by mid May.   

 Wed. April 21:  Wrote my LAST FINAL exam EVER at the U of A!!! Whoohoo! Actually, I didn't feel that elated for some reason...maybe it's kind of sad too b/c it's my last time ever to be there. Awww. Anyway, I actually didn't spend it partying that night...I went to work out instead (which is fun for me anyways).  

 Thursday, April 22:  Put on my dancing shoes to head over to Cowboy's with my buddy Nathan, to meet up with Crystal, Ashley, and Jerin (friends I met on my Mexico trip). We got there at 8:30pm, and there was already a huge line up. We waited in line for over an hour and got no-where, since people in front of us kept letting people bud in. So we headed over to Rum Jungle, where there was a hip-hop party. Since I'm on the Kinetix Plan, I decided against drinking. Anyway, I had a blast...who needs alcohol to have fun, when you can just watch everyone else's drunk ass? Hehe, thanks for the entertainment Nathan! *wink*I wonder how work was him the next day?  

 Friday, April 23:  My karate class held a grading, which went quite well. In following tradition, we always go out for dinner after gradings. We went to an East-Indian restaurant called Maurya's Palace, and I definitely ate WAY too much...but the food was soooooo good. I *know* I ate too much b/c my stomach hurt alot when I tried to lie in bed. I thought I was going to explode! That was my "free target" from my Kinetix plan.   

   
 Saturday & Sunday, April 24 & 25:  Dan came to pick me up at 5AM Saturday morning and we headed to Canmore for a weekend of hiking (man!!! My butt is so sore!!) with Kelly, her cousin Kristy, and Kel's friend from Minnesota, Jason. This was Jason's first time in Canada, so he was in such amazment the whole time, he absolutely loved the mountains. Please check out the pictures  urlLink here . There are mini descriptions as you enlarge each picture. Thanks!

       Day 3 of the 8 Week Experiment   
I've been doing pretty good lately (of course, not seeing results yet...) and 99% of the food I've made suggested by the recipes have been pretty delish....all except what I made this morning - Kinetix Oatmeal.   
Now, I usually love oatmeal, but man, I don't know if it was the cottage cheese that didn't seem to go well with the oats, or the fact that my chocolate protein powder didn't mix well with the whole oatmeal dish...but I had to force the food down halfway through the first bowl!   
Note to self: NO Kinetix Oatmeal! Stick to mom's yummy homecooked oatmeal!  
I also baked 2 loaves banana bread today, and for those of you who know, I'm very clumsy in the kitchen and something always goes wrong. Well...I improved a bit, adding or taking away some ingredients, and when the cakes were baking, the house smelled really good. When I took out the bread, and checked it with a toothpick to make sure it was entiredly cooked, it seemed fine. So I let them cool for an hour.   
So here I am all proud of myself that I baked two perfect looking banana loaves...then I go to cut 1/2 of one to give to Dan, and realize that the centre of the loaf is still a little bit raw. Haha, I  knew  it couldn't be perfect!  
What to do, what to do....well I can't put it back into the stove after it's cooled...or can I? Well I don't want to chance it, so I will just leave the middle raw (it's not that bad, and it still tastes good anyways) and put it in the fridge.   
Dan liked the bread. :o)

        My 8 week Experiment   
On Friday, Dan and I stopped in a new health food supplement store in St. Albert (to check out protein powder prices). That's when I discovered  urlLink this .  It was  urlLink this man  who brought my attention to this 40% protein, 40% carbs, 20% fat nuitrition program (I refuse to use the word diet).   
Can you believe that!? The results of that man make me skeptic...EIGHT weeks from an old, tubby man, to a 30 year old body? His results are probably extreme.   
But check out  urlLink this dude , which is more realistic. He is what inspired me to begin Kinetix, because I'm in the same boat as he was: decent shape, but couldn't get ab definition.   
So my goals for this experiment is to trim down my waistline, get flatter, more defined abs, and more toned arms. I don't expect phenomenal results (like that of the 60 year old man), but I do expect some noticeable change.   
Dan and I went grocery shopping for ingredients that I will need to make the recipes recommended. The best part is, I'm not depriving myself of good food. Check out the  urlLink yummy recipes !I'm so excited about this "experiment"!  
And so it begins...tomorrow.

      For the first time ever in my life, I got pulled over by the cops...for speeding (what else would it be for?) Apparently, I was doing 80 in a 60 zone. Usually I am cautious and aware of photo radar, and I   usually  only go 10 over the speed limit.... However, I was on my way to an interview (I applied at different golf courses to be a server for the summer, to make some good tips) and my mind must have been preoccupied with that. Either that, or I was overexcited about the 2 new pairs of sandals I just bought 5 minutes previous to getting the ticket. Ah, what I typical woman thing.   
Surprisingly, I am not that upset about the ticket, I mean...I guess I deserved it if I was going that fast. Lesson learned, much worse things can happen (like an accident).  I'll be taking it to the courts to get the amount ($124) reduced...and there's no way I'll tell my mom about it. My dad got a photoradar ticket about a month ago, and my mom was  still  nagging at him last week for getting it! I'm just going to go up to my dad and show him the ticket..."Like father, like daughter".

Why did your zipper have to bust on me  now ...TWO DAYS BEFORE classes end for the rest of my days at University of Alberta!? That's ok, now I can resort to Mr. cool Roots bag - which is really designed for a carry-on when travelling...but who cares!?

       Keith's Cure for Cancer MULLET   

Yesterday (Sunday), Keith threw a BBQ get together to raise money for cancer. He decided to let Lon (who is by no means a hairstylist, or have any kind of training in cutting hair) cut his shaggy long hair into a mullet.   

Oh, and we're not talking about just any mullet...it's got to be by far the WORSE mullet and simultaneously, the bravest thing I've seen anyone do with their hair. We had absolutely no plans as to how the mullet would turn out...it was all spontaneous!  

I cut a bit of the bangs, and I have practically zero experience. There was that one time in jr. high when I cut my brother's hair, and nearly cut his ear off...but that's another story!   

Luckily, we had Amy there, who trained herself by watching a 24 minute video on cutting hair, both in English  and  French.  OoooOoh.

      YAY! I got into grad school!!!!!! I'll be going to Loma Linda (part of University of California) in Lacombe (about an hour south of Edmonton). I was accepted into the Marital and Family Therapy Program.   
My dad is so proud and happy for me, he is going to buy me a grad present... almost  anything I want. I say "almost" because I don't think he could afford to buy me an Acura Integra. I am thinking about getting a new digital camera. What would you ask for?

       Week 8 of Kinetix Plan   
Ok, I totally waned off the plan about two to three weeks ago...I took WAY too many free targets - oops! However, I did see results around the beginning, when I was pretty good sticking to the plan. My arms are now more defined and my waist slimmed down a bit, and I have an overall tighter body...just no defined abs. :o(
So I guess the "experiment" was in part, a success, and due to my lack of dedication, I didn't accomplish what I had hoped for most (rock hard stomach).   

I am going to keep going, and pay a bit more attention to the portions I am taking in, as you all know, I LOVE FOOD! Seriously, what would I look like if I didn't work out!? A HUGE BLIMP!?   

Yesterday, Victoria Day, Dan and I had decided to prepare chicken, salad, and other picnic goodies, so that we could go BBQ at Hawrelak Park, since it was nice outside. So we got all prepared and an hour later, literally, as soon as we step outside his condo, IT BEGINS TO RAIN. So we had to turn back, and BBQ'ed on his belcony. Guess what? The sun comes out shortly after! So after lunch, we packed up a blanket and headed to Hawrelak Park to sit and read for awhile. It never really got that hot unfortunately. And they have these nasty bugs D and I have never seen before...but they can be killed so easily! One swipe at them, and they die. Crazy. They are big, black and long, and like to fly in groups above your head. What the hell are they!? Anyone know what I'm talking about?

      Today, I worked with an adorable, 7 year old autistic boy who I worked with 2 summers ago for one month. Although he doesn't speak much, I got to practice my basic French when I worked with him, because his first language is French. My friend Jenn, works with him currently, and she had asked me to sub for her since she wasn't feeling well.  
I had to double up with the boy's other interventionist because it was a playdate with a classmate at school. Since I had not spoken french in well over a year or two, I was pretty rusty, but got into the groove quickly.   

How bad is it when, at the end of the day, the other interventionist tells me that I speak better French than Jenn,  who's  majoring  in French!? YIKES! That's pretty scary stuff, Jenn! (She won't be reading this anyway).

      On Monday and Tuesday, I attended a training course for Nonviolent Physical Crisis Intervention at the Fantasyland hotel. Basically, it is a course designed to teach you how to deal in situations where your client (in my case, autistic children) puts themselves or you in danger physically. It was a really great course put on by the company I work for. We had to take a test at the end, but it was pretty much a joke.   

We finished earlier than expected (around 1pm), so I went shopping (hello? Would I do anything else if I'm at West Ed Mall?), and it was great because I was still being paid until 3:30. SO essentially, I was earning money  while  I shopped! How awesome is that?! I guess we shall see when my VISA statement comes...heheh.  

Had my first soccer game tonight, and whoa, I'm a bit rusty! I had some close calls to getting some goals in, but need to work on my power shots a bit. We won 1-0. Whoo-Hooo!   

Oh yeah...and I made THE BEST chili today!!!! ALL BY MYSELF, NO FLAWS OR CRAZY ACCIDENTS! Ok, whatever, you can laugh, but that won't change the fact that I am proud of myself! I swaer, I am becoming more domestic every day....

       Great Minds Think Alike   

So Dan's birthday and our two year anniversary is coming up on June 2nd, and I thought of the  perfect  present for him/us.   
Last Thursday, I had seen an ad for a  urlLink Cirque Du Soleil  Show called "Quidam" (coming to Calgary)at the gym. So I thought that that would be the perfect gift to surprise Dan with, because I remember how he absolutely loved the show when he saw it in Vegas a few years ago.   

So on Friday morning, I talked to Dan on the phone to confirm that he would be free on the July 17th weekend.   

 Dan:  Yep, I am pretty sure I'm free that weekend, why?   

 Roz:  Ok, good! Keep it that way because it's going to be a me and you weekend to celebrate our 2 year and your birthday.   

 Dan:  Uh-oh. I think I might have something similiar planned, but it's on the weekend after...does this involve purchasing tickets?   

 Roz:  Uh...yes...does this involve going to Calgary?   

 Dan:  Uh...yes...  

It was pretty obvious at this point that Dan and I were both thinking of the same thing.   
 Roz:  Damn! You stole my idea! Did you get tickets already?   

 Dan:  Yes, I got them for the July 25th show. I thought we could go hiking and camping on Saturday and then go shopping or whatever on Sunday before the show.   

That sounded like a perfect plan, but I have a karate BBQ function on July 24th, and I love going to those every summer, so there was no way I was going to miss that! Luckily, Dan sold his tickets easily to a co-worker and purchased tickets for the July 17th show. YAY!  

Ok, but here's the  problem:  Now I have to think of something else to get Dan for his birthday and our anniversary, and it's got to be as good as the tickets! Man! Those tickets would have been the  perfect  present too! Grrr! So people, any ideas!?

      YAY!!!!!!!!! I do not have to pay the speeding ticket I got last month because it has not been processed (which means the cop didn't submit it, or it got lost), and today was the due date for me to pay it. And for those of you wondering...NO, I did not have to flash the cop!   
However, when I spoke with the lady at the Traffic Ticket place, she said that they still have 6 months to submit it (if they chose to) after the expire date (gulp!!!!!). That worries me! What are my chances of having to pay for the ticket, do you think?   
The problem is that my insurance company has decided to give me another chance (because of my "at fault" accident I had back in February), and not raise the insurance as high as they 'should'. The catch? I cannot have any ticket violations or accidents within the next 6 years, or my insurance will double or even triple. How stressful is that?!   
Just on Saturday, my stupid neighbour who wasn't paying attention when she was backing up her car, was just a few inches away from backing into my car! I normally wouldn't freak out, but I was so angry and shaken up by it, (due to the circumstances)...I found it hard to drive to Dan's house (which is practically a straight drive all the way). ACK!   
Then on Sunday, some darn kid almost opens his door into my car, as I'm driving past him in a very car jam-packed street (soccer games going on). I freaked out at that too. I don't want to become super paranoid when I'm driving. :o(

       Roz & Dan's Mother's Day Special   
For Mother's Day, Dan and I decided to have our families get together for dinner at Carolyn's (his sister)house. Dan's parents were in town (they live on Vancouver Island). The plan was to have D and I make the 3 course meal. The interesting part? We don't cook much. Here was the menu (recipes taken from my Kinetix nutrition plan):  

  Appetizer:  urlLink  Summer chicken salad  (minus the chicken)  
 Main Course:   urlLink Rosemary Salmon with Lemon Asparagus Rice   
 Dessert:   urlLink Breakfast Cheesecake    

At one point, when we were baking the cake, it started to bubble   lots  ...and we weren't sure if it was suppose to do that! Despite me being a bit stressed out on trying to make sure everything turned out perfectly (in which, it did!), it was pretty fun!

        I am going crazy over peanut butter right now. In fact, so crazy that I am looking up PB recipes on the internet as we speak. Wow, I didn't know that you could do so much with PB besides make cookies, cake and other such desserts. You can actually make PB oatmeal, or PB soup! Mmmm, I may just have to try that!   
 Today, I opened my pantry, and since I haven't had PB in so long, I was craving some. I opened up a jar of SUPER CHUNKY PB (omg, it looked SO GOOD with all the nuts in there), and I dipped a fig bar (ok, I dipped 3 fig bars- but who's counting?) in the jar. Totally not part of my nutrition plan, but hey, a girl's got to indulge in her favorite thing once in a while. :o)

      Today, I rode my bike all the way from home (Millwoods) to Downtown, so that I could go and get a reduction on the speeding ticket. I thought it would take me 1.5 hours to get there, but I made it in an hour. Pretty good, eh? The hardest part was going up those stairs by Hotel McDonald...Oh my God! That just kicked my ass! I couldn't look up because I couldn't see the end of the stairs (it's all psychological), so instead, I looked down at the steps and kept pushing my bike up (thank god for those bike rails on the side of the stairs! I can't imagine having to carry it up!!!!).   
So I get to the traffic ticket place and they tell me that my ticket has not been processed yet! It's due in one week (may 11th) and they still haven't done so yet?! Dan joked that maybe it got lost and with my luck, I won't have to pay it. YA RIGHT. I wish!

       Convocation   
Wow, it's been awhile since I wrote. Ok...so let's catch up:   

I convocated on Friday at the Jubliee Auditorium, with a BA in Psychology. YAY! It wasn't a super exciting event, because it isn't like gr. 9 or high school grad, where you know everyone and you dress up all pretty for the occasion. Although, I did manage to buy myself some dangerously sexy stilletos.   

I was actually in a grumpy mood, because my parents and I were bickering over dumb things. I think we were stressing each other out. We were already a bit late to the ceremony, and dad decides to take a longer way to get there, and we get stopped by a train. Things like that   really, really   annoy me. My mood went downhill from there.   

Dan met up with us later at a restaurant called Characters. It is expensive dining, but we all agreed that the food was definitely the best we've all had in a long time. I was extremely impressed with the presentational style of the food.   

 Check out the grad pix by clicking on my grad photo below:

      For our  2 year anniversary,  I got us tickets to an improv show called "Secret Spaces: The Bus Project", which takes place on a city bus. The bus tours around Edmonton, and we go to different historical sites and buildings, and at each site, the actors would do skits. They did skits on the bus, as well, the host, A-Channel's morning weather girl, Bridget Ryan would give us some history on some of Edmonton's oldest buildings. IT was educational and entertaining!   

Bridget is hilarious! I love her personality, and Dan told me that she is just as quirky when she does the weather. Now that's waking up to a good personality!   

Anyways, since they act on the bus too, whenever we stopped at red lights, other cars in traffic would look in with puzzled looks, because the actors would be running up and down the bus. At one significant moment, the male actor was dressed like Bridget Ryan, so you can imagine the odd looks the car beside the bus gave us.    

We both really enjoyed the show, and I knew Dan would love it because it's original and creative. It was neat to be a tourist in your own hometown.

      Ok, it's official...I am becoming housewife material. On Wednesday mornings, I am now taking sewing lessons, and I just had my first class this past Wednesday. I expected to be in a room full of old, sweet grannies, but instead, it's just myself and two other men! One guy is about my age and the other's probably around mid thirties. GO figure! It is SEW much fun! (I know, BOO on the pun! That was such a cheesy "Dan" joke).   
We learned how to measure ourselves and what basic materials we will need to sew. For homework, we need to pick out a pattern that we will be making. I am thinking about making a dress.   
Wednesday was also Dan's 25th birthday! After sewing lessons, I headed over to Dan's office and surprised him with chocolate-banana cupcakes that I had made for him and his colleagues. I know, aren't I so sweet?    

Poor Dan, nobody at work remembered his birthday...for the second year in a row! HAHA, maybe they are just bitter that he is so much younger?! ;o) I took Dan out for lunch at Four Rooms. What a great place to eat! I had a peanut curry chicken wrap and D had blue cheese ravioli...MMmmm mmmmm!   

I got D his favorite boardgame, RISK for a birthday present. He loved it because it's the new version too!   

ALso, Wednesday was our 
 two year anniversary!   We will be celebrating it this Sunday (I am surprising him with a present...which I will write about later). And in July, we will be going to a Cirque de Soleil show in Calgary. YAY!

       The Life of a Busy Bee   
 *Sigh*    
Time is the one thing that will never stop...and I wish that it would, because there are so many things I want to do, but am too busy to fit into my jam-packed schedule. Here's a list of things I want to do, but haven't got alot of time for:   
*Baking/cooking new recipes  
*Sewing (as in learning to make new clothes)  
*Updating this blog with more photos    

What are some things you want to accomplish or do, but aren't able to for some reason?

      Lately, my soccer team has been falling apart. In the last two weeks, we've already had to forfeit two games (we play twice a week) due to lack of players. That's really frustrating! Anyways, tonight, we scrambled as many players as possible (we even went to the desperate measures of getting girls who don't even regularly play with us) and ended up with just enough players...lucky number 7. (Ok, so not really that lucky when it comes to being a team).   
Fortunately, the other team only had 10 players, so they were short as well. We were expecting to get demolished, especially after the first half of the game, when the score was 5-0 (for them, of course!)   
However, (I have to brag here now!) in the second half of the game, we made a comeback...and I managed to score a hatrick (with alot of sprinting and ball control involved). Each goal I made from extreme angles from the far left side of the field. They totally didn't look like they would go in, because they were sneaky shots.   
The final score was 6-4 (for them), proving that we could have totally kicked butt if we had a FULL team who could commit. Anyway, I sort of like playing short sometimes because then I get more cardio workout time in. ;o)

       Sunday, July 18:  After a night of drinking, Dan and I took off the next morning to Canmore's Lady McDonald Trail Mountain, in which we only hiked up about half way, the last time we hiked there with Kelly, Kristy, and Jason. We finished it this time, and it was like climbing up stairs for four hours! It took us about two hours to get back down.  
  PS:  Kelly, Jason, and Kristy - the view is amazing from up there!

       July 17 , Dan and I went to Calgary to spend the day at the Stampede, which in our opinion, wasn't as great as the hype made it out to be. Then we went to see Cirque de Soleil, which was just as great, if not more, than the hype had made it out to be. Afterwards, we went and partied on 17th Street with my Calgary bud, Cory and his friends.

      Hey Folks! Thanks for your patience! I have started my photoblog. The photos date back to events as late as June, since that was pretty much the last time I posted anything. The events include mine and Dan's trip to Vancouver and Qualicum Beach, my sewing class, and Quang's birthday. Let me know if this is taking too long to download, and I may change the format a bit. There is more to come, like the Calgary trip Dan and I went on just this last weekend. Stay tuned!!!

      Tonight I played Ultimate Frisbee for Dan's team again (for the second time), and the team did awesome! We usually lose (by ALOT), but today, we were kickin' butt. By half time, we were at 7-1. However, I think we started to get cocky and lose it in the second half, and the other team racked up points alot faster than we did. The final score was 15-8, and yours truly scored the winning point. YAY! Ok...I can't take  all   the credit, since the pass was probably less than a metre away...but who's really counting?   
I didn't think I could really get into Ultimate at first, but once I got the hang of it, I really enjoy it. Of course, not as much as karate and soccer. ;o)   

After our game, Dan and I went back to my place to make carrot-raisin muffins for one of his coworkers, because his company is throwing a surprise wedding shower for her. The muffins turned out okay, they were a bit crunchy (as oppose to the usual softness that muffins should be), but we figure after adding the cream cheese icing, no one would notice. Heheh. 
Mmmmmm....the cream cheese topping tasted like a piece of heaven.   
 D and I even made a small, separate batch for ourselves to take on our camping trip that we're going on this weekend. Except of course, I substituted some ingredients for lower fat content ones, and they actually turned out  much  better. They were super moist and delicious, 
 and  healthier!    

Being the cooking/baking geek I am, I really enjoy collecting recipes, then figuring out ways to make them low-fat. Yes...I actually find it   quite   fun.   

  Ps: Birthday pictures to come soon!

       New Face for RADS Digitized   

You digging it, or what? Well I think it's pretty groovy!   

Tonight, I played my first (real) game of ultimate frisbee on Dan's team. This was my second time ever playing, and I had a great time. I even managed to score a point! However, I didn't realize I scored a point, and threw the frisbee to another teammate, who dropped it. Unfortunately, the other team had to be anal about the fact that I didn't hold on to it for four seconds to mark that I had scored a point, so it didn't count.   Boo!  Dan's team wants me to go out and play for them again next Thursday, I guess this is a good thing, meaning...I don't suck!   

In other news, I am turning 23 in 2 days (August 7th). I think I already think I am 23 because when one of Dan's teammate asked how old I was, I accidentally answered "Twenty-three". Oops.   
Since Dan and I are attending a wedding on Saturday, I will be celebrating my bday on Sunday by going to Sylvan Lake, then having a potluck BBQ at Hawrelak Park. I can't wait! YAY!   
 And a short message to those of you who haven't RSVP'd me about my birthday, damnit, get to it!

      Cutest thing ever happened to me today.   
I was at a park, playing tag with one of my little guys that I work with, and his brother.    
Suddenly, a cute girl, about 6 years old, comes up to me and says, "You're beautiful". And here I am, makeup-free, and wearing some less than flattering clothes (i.e., kid-friendly wear).   
Doesn't stuff like that make your day?!   
                            ---------------------------   
That reminds me about another time, back in first year of university when I shared a sociology class with an ex-boyfriend, who recently broke up with me. A girl sitting behind me tapped my shoulder and told me, "My friend and I were just talking about you, and we think you're so pretty". As if that comment didn't already make my day, my ex probably heard her say that, since he was sitting beside me. HAH! Too bad it wasn't a hot guy though, that would have made the situation all that much better. Regardless, it's nice when strangers tell you (genuinely and randomly) that they think you're beautiful.

Byron, Michelle's boyfriend, threw a surprise bash at O'Byrnes Irish Pub for her birthday. However, Michelle seemed to miss the point, as she had thought it was a coincidence that Dan happened to be at the bar (I wasn't with him yet because I was still in karate class), and then, she still didn't get the hint when she bumped into Suzy and Stefko...two people who rarely go to the bar. HAH! Sadly, she wasn't drunk yet.... Oh well, we all have our blond moments! ;o)  

As for the rest of the night, let's just say...Michelle couldn't remember much about it. She ended up having to be dragged out of the bar, vomiting on the sidewalk outside O'Byrnes, and having a cabbie driving away with ONE of her shoes AND her purse (which luckily, she got back a few days later with everything still inside it...hooray for honest people!)

You won't be sorry (except, maybe I will be, after Michelle tries to beat my ass for posting these pictures!) Hey Michelle, what are best friends for? I love ya! ;o)
