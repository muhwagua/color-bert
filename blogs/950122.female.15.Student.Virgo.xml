      Hi! This is my new blog... I decided to move my blog here after I realized that I wouldn't be able to have any archives whatsoever with Geocities. So I'm making my Geocities site my personal site and this my blog!

       To Speedo-kun:  Yup! n_n Tell me the addies to those yaoi doujinshi sometime, alright? :)  urlLink Here  is a page with some scanlations of Yami no Matsuei. n_n It only goes up to volume three tho. But it's still worth checking out.    Well! I've changed my layout once again... I really like this one. n_n I think I'll stick with this for a while. It's even my fav. color! And I don't care if it's a dead color mom! >    Anyway, nothing much has happened lately. Jeth's now trying out his new disposable contacts. n_n;; And I quote:  My eyes!!!!  Haha, it's funny. n_n;;    Ergh, I'm a bit braindead at the moment.. I've been doing a lot since this morning. >

      I've read the first three volumes of Yami no Matsuei, and I'm hooked! n_n I like Hijiri for some reason. Oh yeah, I remember getting him on a quiz. Tsuzuki and Hisoka are priceless! And Muraki... Muraki interests me. n_n Seriously!     To Speedo-kun:  I think you should get a Yahoo Messenger. That way, if we're both online, we can chat! n_n You don't need a yahoo e-mail adress to sign or anything either! n_n

      Argh... My mom, dad and brother are going to Virginia,  and are leaving me behind!  Argh. It's so shitty! Really! >P They're just going to leave me with my aunt. It's so mean!    I accidentaly cut my finger with a razor blade early this morning. It's pretty ironic, because my dad had just told me to be careful, then I cut myself. n_n;; I didn't tell him I cut myself though; he would probably freak out and suffer a panic attack. XD Anyway, it was sorta weird because it just surprised me. It didn't hurt much, but there was a lot of blood! >    We went to Glorietta to watch Johnny English, but ended up just walking around. My mom bought me boots! n_n I also bought some books. I saw this one book;  A Guide to Tolkien . I wanted to get it, but I decided against it. I need to save like everyone else! >

      I watched Animal Planet this morning, and the show was about animal fathers. Gosh! I was amazed at how quickly I realized that some males really suck. Can you believe that male seals actually  rape  female seals just for the sex?! Sheesh! It made me scream out one of my new mottos:     I wish men were more like sea horses!     Funny, but true. n_n

       New World  by  Round Table  has found a place in my head. It's a cute song! n_n    I've watched the first two episodes of Wolf's Rain. I loved it! The ending song,  Gravity  sung by  Maaya Sakamoto , is beautiful. I'm completely in love with the song.

      Hay... it's 2:00 a.m... I have to stay up untill we leave for Iriga so I can sleep on the way there.n_n;;    I've really gotten into yaoi lately... n_n;; But I have no idea what 1x2 and all that other stuff means. XD And I had no idea that Jakult was actually... that. Yech. XP Maybe I still have some innocence in me. Nah. Anyway... I found some Gundam Wing doushinshi [?] you can see a pic  urlLink here . I found it quite funny. n_n Yeah, I've also gotten into that as well, and... well.. some  other  things. n_n    Speedo-kun, I wouldn't kill you either. n_n;;

      It's amazing what people would say over a song. I download lot's of files using WinMX, a file sharing program like Kazaa. I was downloading anime episodes, so I kept the computer on all through the night. I was only able to get back to the computer at about 3:00 p.m today, and it turns out this guy was messaging me throughout the whole night. Apparently he wanted to download one of the songs on the computer, but kept on getting disconnected. n_n;; Poor guy. He wanted the song so badly he messaged me about 15 times. But then again, he got pissed off with me [duh! How the heck am I supposed to reply?] and told me that he had already downloaded the song off of someone else, saying that I was an 'ignorant bastard', and that I should go do a bear. n_n;;; MEN!    I'm currently looking up the anime,  Wolf's Rain.  I've been hearing that it's really good, so I've decided to look it up myself. From what I've read and found, I've been convinced to actually start downloading it on WinMX. n_n;; With that, I just have to say that I love  Google.  I usually find everything there. n_n What?? You thought I was going to say someone's name?? Heh! You wish! XD

      Well, lot's more happened than my previous post, so I'll post it. I'll try not to transmit gloomy vibes through your screens. n_n    I've been trying to write  something ,  anything  for quite a while now. Nothing's some out. n_n ARGH! I wonder if I'll ever get my character's past right. n_n; I wonder if I'll  ever  get anything right. n_n;;;     ''A little biRdy in the sKy  DroPped A poOpOO in mY eyE.  I didNt Laugh,  I diDnt cry.  I jusT tHanKEd God...      COWS DONT FLY''     I got this off of AC. I found it funny. n_n Here's another one.     "Duct tape is like the force, it has a dark side, it has a light side, and it holds the Universe together."  --Carl Zwanig     I got this off of a blog that's no longer updated. Too bad.    Oh yeah. I bought this manga... Shadow of the Dark River. This is the same manga that made Enid go on a kissing craze... n_n But this is the second volume, so it's got things other that FKs. Hehe. n_n;; I've shown it Gela already, and I think I've gotten her hooked. She wants me to look for the third volume. n_n *shrugs* What can I say?    Oh yeah, I've red streaks in my hair... my mom let me! n_n

      Ok. It hasn't sunken in yet, so I'll take this opportunity to post it now before I become increasingly depressed.    My aunt died early this morning... cancer. Tristan and Pocholo's mom. I'm scared to go to Iriga now... I dunno. Maybe I'm in denial or something.. Even my father pointed out that in a span of roughly four years, we've lost many of those close to us. Chiara, Eddie boy, Cheif, Indy, Uncle Sonny, Lolo Ernie, Lolo Judge and now Auntie Jing-jing. It's like some sick coincidence. Even freakier, at around 11:30 last night, something  'flashed'  in my eyes. I was freaked out to find out she died early this morning...    I'm not sure what I'm going to do when I het to Iriga. I'm probably going to become moral support.. I hope I can handle it this time.

      Hehe. I haven't updated my blog lately, now have I. Nope!  My cousin from Austria was staying in the study room, so basically I was cut off from the internet for three days.  Oh well. Lalala... I'm quite bored. Let's just try to remember what I was feeling for the past three or so days.    Let's see... April 4!       April 4, 2003     My brother graduated high schoool today. I'm reluctant to say it, but I guess I'm a bit jealous of him. Most of the time I'm used to getting all the attention in the house, now everyone's concentrating on Jeth. Recognition Day, Graduation Day, Graduation Prom... I dunno. I'm just not used to it. I guess I'm pretty selfish huh? Weird to think. Goody-two-shoes me is not so angelic. But then again, who said I was angelic in the first place? n_n;;       April 5, 2003     Stephan is here. He's my cousin from my dad's side. He's from Austria, and can speak fluent German. Crystal and I had fun having him translate some phrases for us [Mostly Crystal; she was in a questionable state], like 'Fuck the truth', 'You suck!' and 'Shit!'. I still remember some of them. Haha. I wonder if I'll  actually  end up using them.    Crystal [my 17 year old aunt] and I were lying down on my top bunk doing nothing. We were talking about how we really didn't have anything to do, but the topic just led us to that; doing nothing. So we just stayed there, staring at the ceiling. Then Crystal asked me, "Ria, what's the meaning of our lives??" in a very subtle manner. I replied, "Gosh Crystal, are we really  that  bored?"    But that just brings me to why I don't like having nothing to do. It's not that I dislike not having anything to do because I don't have anything to do, but it makes me think of things I don't want to think about because there really is nothing else to do. [I hope you got that. n_n;;]    For some reason, I don't feel as if Jeth has already graduated. It's like I've always had to be the big sister to him, and he's off to college!    Gosh, the house will be so empty once he leaves.       April 7, 2003     I can't really remember anything that happened yesterday, so I'll just post about today. Stephan has gone back to Uncle Teddy's place, where he first started. Crystal is leaving tomorrow, so basically I'll be pretty alone in this house since Jeth locks himself up in his room all day long. Really, I don't want to be alone. It's makes me think too much. I remember this time during sophomore year, I was supposed to organize my group in cooking as the next day we would be cooking/baking something. [I forget.] I was sitting on the couch upstairs SMSing everyone, then I had to wait for their replies. I started to think too much during my wait, and I had to leave the organizing up to Mikara.    Hmmmmmmmmmmm. Here I go again. I'm starting to think too much. I don't want to be alone. Jeth is leaving, Crystal is leaving... I mean, even if Jeth holes himself up in his room, I still know he's  there . But in June, he'll be gone...      Schaisse!     I'm thinking too much again.    P.S--> I did end up using the German words Stephan taught me.

      I just watched Forest Gump and Cast Away, both with Tom Hanks as the lead role. I dunno, both movies hit me in a way. It should have hit me a long time ago, since I've already seen them before. Forest Gump... it made me feel like I'm wasting my time. My mom told me that there is no such thing as a limited person. And I quote, 'Stupid is as stupid does.' Well, something like that. On the other hand, Cast Away made me feel like I was an island in the middle of the sea. I may have everything, but I'm surrounded by merely water.

      Hehe. Sorry for not updating lately.

      It's raining. Still raining. It's been raining for roughly three days. And I love it. n_n    I'm just waiting for school to jump me. In roughly one month, it'll be school again, and I'm waiting for my brain to comprehend it. Hehe, then I'll be panic stricken, running about the house screaming "OMG school starts tomorrow!". But I'll get to see everyone! :D Then I'll be all happy-dappy screaming "OMG school starts tomorrow!". That would tick my parents off either way because of my noise pollution. Hehe.

      Poo. I've been feeling weird lately.    After reading my past entries, I've realized that I'm no good at keeping one thought. n_n; I guess that's bad... but I guess I don't care much.    I bought a book of Hamlet. I couldn't find an english version of Noli, so I decided to buy it instead. I remember someone telling me that we might take it up in third year, so I decided to look it up. [Hoshi, was that you?]  I haven't read past the first scene... n_n; The way Shakespeare wrote is quite confusing. He has no sense of sentence construction! >    Not much happened today... So I'll be signing off early. Sweet dreams. That's what we all need.

      Yey! I'm back from Iriga! n_n I ate tons of Indian Mangos and did nothing but swim, play the PS and take up piano. Not to mention bum around the house, wake up late and... some other stuff. n_n;;    Sometimes I get the feeling that... I'm disconnected. Disconnected... from something. I'm not really sure. Then I snap back, just like that. It's weird when things suddenly pop into your mind without warning. That's one reason why I hate my imagination.    Speedo-kun! I saw you go online in YM! But it was only for a second or so... n_n; BTW, my Yahoo ID is  the_blacksolstice . Also, your archives don't work... n_n;;   Mikara:  Are you still looking for PS game suggestions? n_n Also, what genre are you into?    I watched  Matrix: Reloaded ! It was so cool! :D

      Hiya! I'm back from my mini vacation. n_n I went to Cauayan, Isabela for three days. I got to see Callao caves and the Rice Terraces. It was fun. Well worth the three days. :)     You are a Day Dreamer..   Daydreamers tend to be away from the normal, and have a deeper aspect when looking at things. Most of the time, thier outcasts of the social society, but don't worry. It just means your so deep it scares thier simple little brains.    urlLink   What kind of Dreamer are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      There's a lot on my mind again.. It's a weird feeling when you have so much to think about, that you can't even think straight. It's like... you don't know where to start;  how  to start.    I think I'll go to bed. It's been a long day.

I haven't eaten lunch yet, and it's... 6:20 p.m?! >    Gundam W will be showing on Cartoon Network after Tuesday! Digimon Tamers ended yesterday [I think] and I have only seen 2 episodes of Invader Zim. The one where he makes this one kid his 'best friend', the one where they had to sell chocolate bars to make money... and when Zim invaded Dib's body. Wait, that's three episodes. It doesn't matter anyhoo, I never catch it anyway.

      Coup de etat. Well, something like it. Some young soldiers have taken over Makati, and all of the foreigners have been evacuated from their hotels. All the malls there are closed as well. Tomorrow the economy will drop. This is freaky. 0_o Part of me still doesn't realize what's going on; it's not like I can't believe it, it's just that, I never thought I'd have to go thru one of them. Besides, the country isn't in need of a coup. This 'coup' will just make the country worse.

      Wow!  I met Duncan Sheik last sunday! :D It was so cool! I never thought I'd meet him. :P I got a poster, a mag, his latest CD and his autograph! :D Sure isn't something that happens everyday. It all happened like this. My family and I went to Church, then we went to a local mall for lunch. While we were eating, my brother text his classmate from 2nd grade (from Japan). One of her friends had found my brother's website, and signed the guestbook, giving him Marielle's (bro's classmate from 2nd grade) e-mail address. He e-mailed her, and it turned out that she was here in the Philippines, right next to Ateneo, which is pretty close. So, she e-mailed him her cell number. They text each other, and she said that she was going to Greenbelt, a strip of nice restaurants and cafes near Makati. My mom, always wanting my brother to go out, had us pick her up and to go Greenbelt. :P So, we went there, and went to Music 1, a music store where Marielle's friends work. It also turned out that Duncan Sheik was to be there at 2:30 p.m  (We got there at 2:00 p.m) for autograph signing. So we stayed there because Marielle had been listening to his music ever since she was in 5th grade. Then he came, and I met Duncan Sheik. Cool huh? :D  Tests are next month~! Geez, time flies.

      Not being able to go online has been hell! I end up with not much to do. Anyway, nothing much happened this week. Went to outreach last friday tho. I helped teach some special children in a centre called "Nayon ng Kabataan". I ended up making drawings for a lot of kids. :) The best part of the trip tho was our bus ride to and fro. Our class rode in three buses, but only two teachers went with us, and our bus ended up being the one unsupervised. We'll be going back sometime next quarter, so I won't be seeing them for a while.  We're having half day on Monday; the high school and grade school teachers are going on a pilgrimage for enlightenment. Don't know whether I should be happy or sad.   Oh yeah, my birthday is this friday. Wonder what'll happen.

      6 days in my auntie's house, and 45 days till my family returns. I'm not as depressed as I thought I would be. n_n  I went to Glorietta with my friends yesterday. I went there with Gela, and we walked around for a while before we stopped at Pizza Hut to wait for Camilla and Racine. After that we walked around even more and ended up watching a romantic-comedy movie. Then we went to the hotel Camilla's family was staying at. She and her sister tried to teach me this card game, but it was all in vain. x_X Funky. It was a lot of fun. :D But on the way home I ended up leaving my cellphone in Gela's car. So I survived a night without my phone then Gela returned it the next day. n_n Maybe I'll call her later. :D

      I forgot to post this on my previous post... I won't be staying in my house while my family is away. They'll be gone until sometime in October... so I won't be online much. And I won't be going to any gimmicks either... I'll probably be able to update my blog during the weekends only for a while. I hope things will only get better for now.

      Blackout in the Northeast! It sounds weird hearing it on CNN and FOX. Then again, there were a lot of places that were affected, so it's understandable. We really depend on electricity now a days. Seeing photos from NYC with the traffic jams, people walking in the streets and commuters sleeping everywhere, I just imagined what it would be like if we really used up all of our energy resources. Conserve energy! It's not to late!!! [I hope.]  urlLink Here  are some pictures of the blackout in NYC taken by the moderator of  urlLink imood.com .  About being forgotten.... I feel like I'm being abandoned by my family. It's a stupid thing to say, but them going to Virginia and all.... it makes me feel all alone. Solitude is okay, but loneliness is different. I feel so left behind. My mom keeps on talking to me about what would happen if anything were to happen to them; where the Bonds are, where my parent's wills are, where we keep our important documents... but I just don't want to think about it. It's selfish, but I really don't care that much at the moment. We're all being inconsiderate to each other. Everytime I start to miss my brother, he does something that makes me feel like I shouldn't miss him.  He had his farewell party yesterday; we all had a lot of fun. Now I know I'll miss him no matter what he does or says to me. u.u I don't knw how to let him go.... I don't know if I can let him go.

      Happy Birthday Mom! It's my mom's birthday. n_n She's 26 as always. Lol. :P  Yes! I got a CD burner today! :D Oh happy happy. n_n I also bought a tee, a bunch of CDs, a throw pillow and some Inu-Yasha manga. Greenhill is a lovely mall. Oh yeah, I also got a FF9 mini soundtrack for my friend Guia. I spent a lot of my money tho... x_x But I'll make up for it with my CD burner. Hopefully...  Oh damn. My brother is leaving in ten days. x_x It's hard to imagine what it'll be like when he's gone, even if he usually locks himself up in his room... He'll be going to Virginia... along with my parents; I'll be all alone.... even on my birthday! >

      Tests are over... They weren't as hard as I thought they would be. Studying helps alot. :P I should study more often. 0_o Gela was absent for the three days of major tests. I found out earlier today that she had Typhoid Fever, which really freaked me out. She's better now. n_n Gela LIVES! :) Our Chemistry test was very easy... our English test ended up being hard. >< It pissed me off; I studied all night for Chem instead of English. I should get over it pretty soon tho... Next week we'll have new lessons; more things to study. :P

      Yey! My parent's will be back soon! :D It sounds pretty weird, doesn't it? Anyway, I'll be able to go back to my house when they come back. I just miss them a lot. n_n I ended up buying the infamous pair of pants, along with a Vienna Teng cd. Pretty good buy. Unfortunately, now I'm broke. ><

      My blog is pretty lonely now. n_n;; My birthday was lonelier than expected. It didn't feel like my birthday that much, but Tepai gave me a bouqet of flowers, and that made my day. The pair of pants I was planning to buy didn't fit me when I tried it on. ;_; And I didn't get to go to the Ragnafest either. ;_; Aw sad. I hope they have another one some time soon. n_n

      I watched  Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind  last night, and I cried through nearly half of it... especially the end. >   Anyway... internet has been a drag. My connection is never stable now-a-days. Damn... It pisses me off. >  Today we went to the UFO Church in U.P. I met Janelle there. Then we went to Greenhills and stayed there for 5 hours. 0_o It was so boring. My mom was so overwhelmed by the jewelry she was buying for her business. Ugh. I wonder if she'll ever get tired of looking at things that sparkle. >

      Sorry I haven't posted lately. I've been busy with things like studying for tests and last minute projects.  My brother is gone now. The house is empty. My mom has changed the way she treats me; she's trying to make me more responsible and 'prepared'. Anway, I had my last day of tests today. I went to school earlier than usual because the car was banned, and that gave me more time to study for Christian Living, Araling Panlipunan and Journalism. Luckily for me, the tests weren't that hard. :) After that, I had practice for our presentation that we'll be presenting tomorrow, and went home with Camilla while my parents were at Greenhills. Had  three slices of cheese pizza for lunch, then we went out to buy mangos so I could help Camilla make Maki, but just as we finished slicing all the mangos, my parents came to pick me up. Then we went home and since then I've been doing nothing but become a blob in front of the computer. Actually, I should be playing right now... but I'm out of money. *sigh* Not really and eventful day.  I logged on to  urlLink Friendster  earlier to find out my brother already has an account. 0_o Well, now he's my friend, so no worries. Not much more to say... so peace out.

      Ouch! I got hit in the face with a softball on wednesday and thursday... now I have bruises on my nose and on my right cheek. x_x My parents are wondering what type of training I'm going through. n_n;; Anyway, I'm back home! :) The house was so humid that mildew was growing everywhere. Gah. Luckily, you just have to wipe it and it's gone. n_n

      I guess I had a bad day today. I really don't want to talk about it, so let's just say I had a bad day. Things just came crashing down on me... I finished some of them, but not all.. like that stupid ass music project. I hate it when she doensn't announce when we're to pass her projects!! Just because we always miss her class, doesn't mean that we're going to read her damned mind..   Anyway, tomorrow is a holiday; Hari Raya I think.. but our retreat is tomorrow, so we're going to go to school anyway. I'm not so excited.. I'm not really in the mood to 'open up', cry and stuff like that.. I hope I'm just in a bad mood. I don't want to end up ruining everyone else's retreat just because I feel like a pathetic bitch.I hate it when I feel like this..  It's during times like these I realize I need a punching bag...

      Ack. I got my report card for the Second Quarter on saturday, and my grades in about six subjects went down. @_@ My grade in Trigonometry is 76. ;_;   ...  And now, my internet connection has failed. Again. -_-;; So as I'm typing this, I have no internet connection. My mom says that I'm relying too much on technology, which is true, but we're paying to get internet service. And so, we're paying for a service that isn't even working! That's not right! If she has to send an important e-mail and the internet fails her, what would she do? She gets pissed off just as I do, doesn't she? To put it bluntly, I live on the internet. n_n;; I know it's not good, but it's true. I don't watch TV because of this bad habit I have (I tend to faze out when I'm watching TV... and when someone talks to me, I don't notice... it's completely rude, and completely embarrassing) and I don't talk on the phone. Well, we don't have a phone. -_-;; I have a cell phone, but calling on a cell phone is impractical because it's expensive. Text on the other hand isn't very reliable, and as most of my friends text a lot, they're usually out of load. As for me, I don't know why I don't text. n_n;; Technology is supposed to be reliable! That's why a lot of people say that technology is the future! Sure, we shouldn't go as far as 'The Matrix', but I probably won't be alive then! 0_o  ...  You know, I can't believe that I'm getting this worked up about a stupid internet connection... I just hate it when things don't work, even if I'm good at compromising.  Phew. Haven't ranted in a while.. -_-;;

      I actually understood our lesson in Chem today!! XD I'm so proud of myself! We had Mass to Volume conversion in our Stoichiometry chapter. Maybe I should pay more attention in class. *wink*  I stayed up all night just reading an online comic titled  urlLink "RPG World" . :D It's funny, taking up all the stupid things in RPGs like repetitive battles and stupid heros. Lol. Most of the puns were rips from the FF series. :P The thing is, the comic has been up for three years, so I read three years worth of comics. 0_o Hekhek, bad for the eyes... @_@ But once I started the story, I figured it would be too much a hassle to stop then and begin again tomorrow.  Oh yeah... I saw Racine's date to the Prom!! :P He's got a nice smile. Plus he's megane. Lucky Racine. :P Speaking of the prom, now my dad wants me to have a date. >< It's not like I don't want a date, it's just that I'm not sure if I'll like my date. I mean, a bad date can ruin a prom.. Of course, me, being me, I'm expecting too much of the prom. Ergh.. *mumble stupid prom mumble mumble*

      Read Kari's post about living without internet.. I wish I could say the same, that not being able to live with out internet is kinda stupid [which it is] but internet is my only connection to the outside world, aside from my cellphone. Well, at least I think so.. After all, the only way I get to 'talk' to my friends when not at school is through chat, which technically isn't even talk. Thinking about it makes me feel lonely... Yeah, I'm lonely..  Gawd. How can one enjoy solitude but feel lonely at the same time?  I feel like my stupid internet connecetion; stupid, and always disconnected.

       Listening to: -   Merry Christmas people! It's 2:33 am, and I really shouldn't be up anymore, but I'm not sleepy, so thing. :P ~~~~~ Let's travel back in time. n_n;; Last tuesday I went to Galleria with Gela to meet up with Racine and Camilla, and this guy and his friends from their interaction. We ended up getting there late, but Racine was the last to come. n_n;; We ate at Pizza Hut and decided to roam around until the guys got there. They didn't until around 3-4 pm, which was bad because we had been there since around 12. During that span of time we basically went everywhere in Galle. Then, as we were going up the stairs to go to Starbucks, I saw him. 0_o The guy I had (note: had) a crush on at the interaction. He was with two of my other classmates. Damn, it really caught me off guard! There I was, hoping to meet a nice guy, when out of the blue, I meet the guy I gave up on. He wasn't supposed to be there!! n_n;; Seriously though, it pissed me off. What pissed me off more was the fact that sooo many other guys at Galle looked like him. > ~~~~~ Christmas Eve! Actually, it's already Christmas here. :P I got a portable sewing machine from my auntie! O_o And right now, I'm trying to translate this H doujin.. (Don't ask why. n_n;;)How do I do this?!?! x_x Heeelp!  But overall, this Christmas is way much better than last year's. :P

      I bought my prom dress today! Guess how much?? 800 pesos only!! That's like... 14 US dollars!! XD It's actually pretty simple.. I'm going to have a shawl, but my parents and I are debating on how the shawl should look. n_n;; But still, it's one big load off my chest. I don't have to worry about my main dress anymore. Plus, I got it at a really cheap price. Which makes today a happy day. :P

      Yey! Christmas Vacation! Two weeks of having nothing school related to do! :D Now I can try to get my mind off that horrid Trigo exam... I'm sure I failed it.. and I know that I fail Trigo this quarter.. >  Anyway, a few nights ago I felt like crap. Why? Because I passed up the opportunity to go to a friend's house to go to a Christmas party. Then what happened? I ended up losing my transpo and not going to the party. Right now I'm just telling myself that everything happens for a reason. Gah. On the brighter side, I got these kick-ass platforms from my auntie! :3 They're really comfortable and the design is cute too. :P Plus, I look taller when I wear them. XD Anyway, I went to Greenhills yesterday with my family. I bought the Sims : Making Magic! But something's wrong with the cd... n_n;; Never buy pirated, eh? At least I've installed it. Now I just need a cd that'll run properly.  It's settled. I'm going to the prom. Most likely without a date, but who cares? My mom suggested that I take my cousin (Tristan?!?!) as my prom date, but I reasoned with her, telling her that he'd wear a tux, but have army boots on. n_n;; I'm getting a bit worried about my dress. I haven't been to the seamstress yet; actually, none of us have been to the seamstress yet. Plus, I don't have a design. I'll probably just rip something off the internet and modify it a bit.. n_n;; If all else fails, I'll just guy one. It can't be that bad. :P  I'm worried about my family. My mom just had a checkup, and her blood pressure is really high. She's taking medicine and not doing much around the house now. Dad, on the other hand, always seems to get on my mom's nerves, and just this morning I woke up to hear mom nagging dad again. Like usual, it was about money. My mom does all the budgeting, and my dad just loves to spend. It's not exactly the best combination, especially because we're not exactly rich or anything. My parents don't work for goodness sakes. We're just relying on dad's pension.. That's why I try my best not to spend too much. Because if I do, I might not have anything to fall back on.  *looks at her computer clock* Wow, only four more days 'till Christmas. n_n My aunties (My mom's sisters) will be spending Christmas with us this year. They're coming here tomorrow with my grandma from the province. I wonder what will happen this Christmas. I can expect the unexpected because my mom's sisters are crazy! They all have these trademark laughs. 0_o I hope it'll be more fun than last year.. *looks back*

      Went to an anime convention last Saturday. Over all it was ok.. I ended up either getting pulled around or being left behind.. n_n;; I got this drawing there, but unfortunately it's missing right now, so yeah.. We got the idea to cosplay, but I don't know if we'll really end up pulling it off. Rivermaya was there. I'm going to buy one of their CDs on of these days. Anyway, when they started playing, (we were sitting on the floor) everyone just suddenly got up and left to watch. n_n;; I really felt like crap at that moment. And they were playing that song.. "Umaaraw Umuulan" (LT: Basically a song on trying not to be sad and how life is "sadyang ganyan") I couldn't exactly go and watch too; I didn't want to leave their things just  there . Especially because they bought this stuffed toy that cost 500 pesos. So when they came back, I just left. I really just couldn't take it.  We saw Imelda Marcos that day. She was inside this Japanese candy store. They wouldn't let anyone else in. She had like, 7 bodyguards? Ugh. Frick her. She should be rotting in jail, that old hag.  Afterwards we went to Camilla's house. Ordered pizza and watched Weiss: Gluhen. It was more like a violent soap opera where the person you vow to protect dies, you get used by the bad guy, and the old man you end up killing is actually your grandfather. And that was only the first four episodes. So yeah. Then I went home.  Anyway... I got thinking again. And guess what I started thinking about! Guys. Ugh. It's the file in my brain that reads: "Don't Open". But stupid little me; I obviously don't know how to read. I got to thinking about it because of out junior prom.. which is only one month from now. crap. Well, my friends all have dates, so they said I should have a date too, because they'd be busy with their dates. And I wouldn't be busy at all. But unlike them, I don't know a whole class of boys or have a kuya or even have a partner from our interaction. I don't even have a guy text mate. Tuh! The last guy who text messaged me text me for only half a day and never text back. So yeah. My social life with the opposite sex is very happy. Actually, I'm having second thoughts on going to the prom. I mean, I'd only end up being 'the pretty little wallflower' like my mom says. That's what happens to all the occasions I go to. Besides, if I don't go, I won't have to buy a dress. I could just give my invitation to a classmate (who's bringing two dates) and she could just pay me back.  The whole prom seems like such a hassle now.

      I had my retreat with my class last November 26-29. We sneaked our phones and food into our room though, and we had codenames for both. We called our phones "Panty" and the food "Utang" (LT: loan? I'm not really sure) It was funny hearing my room mates casually going : "Ria, can I borrow your panty?" or "Ria, there's a name on your panty!" (meaning I just got a text message) It was so bad and yet so hilarious! XD The place was wonderful too. It had a nice abiance surrounding it, and it wasn't that noisy (except for the roosters outside our rooms and our own noise.)  The food was good too. They fed us 6 times a day for krissakes! And after our snacks, they let us have a siesta/nap. Suuuper fattening activities. Lol.  Our proctors, Brother Paulo and Brother Bernard, were wonderfully gay. n_n And when I say gay, I mean it both ways, even tho they're both straight. :D It was so much fun listening to them and watching them. But Brother Bernard's life story is so sad. n_n;; Most of my classmates cried. Yeah...  The Retreat turned out waaaay better than I expected, and I feel really lucky.  --------  After the retreat, I went to Lillia's house to work on a project, then I went to Gela's house.  --------  I went to the J&J Cheering Competition last Saturday with Gela and co. after sleeping over at her house. We got to play the Sims : Making Magic. I've got to buy that CD and install it without Jeth.. :P I fell asleep too much.. n_n;; I practically beat the purpose of the sleepover. Lol.   Anyway, we got at the Ultra Colesseum the next morning a bit later than expected, but it didn't start until an hour or so later... ugh, talk about Filipino Time.. As we were going in, we were given this kick-ass cute-ass halos. :3 We got the best seats because our school was right above the judges so we got the best view. Then it started..and then we saw Miriam College's cheer. I got scared. Honestly in my opinion, it was good. But then they copied some of our stuff, (I heard they even used our school cheer during the elims) and I couldn't help but jeer. Hah. At the end of their showy performance, we found out that they didn't have saftey marshals for their wild moves(like throwing cheerleaders all over the place), and it was a big downer for them and a big upper for us. :D (I'm bias. So sue me.) Then we performed. And I screamed, yelled and cheered at the top of my lungs while snapping pictures for our newsletter. And I absolutely loved it. :P I was just shoving it in MC's face. Or at least I saw it like that. Lol. In the end, SSA (School of Saint Anthony), last year's Champions got first place again. It hurt a bit, but they were really good. Plus, they weren't copy-cats. (I can't think of a better term. n_n;;) We got First Runner Up and MC got Second Runner Up. Afterwards, we sat on this legde-like thing that was on the corner of Ultra. Because of our halos, everyone passing by knew we were SHSians. (I heard another school wanted to steal our halos. 0_o) It was so cool sitting there because all the other students of the schools that joined congradulated us. Even those in the buses passing by made a 'C' with their hands. n_n;; St. Mary's even chanted "Holy! Holy!" as their bus passed by. Miriam on the other hand closed their curtains. n_n;;; I'm really glad we went.  Afterwards, we ate at Kamameshi House. We started telling those wierd brain-teaser like things and even the staff ended up listening in. 'Twas kick-ass I tell you. n_n  Then I went home, and slept like a rock.

       Listening to: Garbage ~ Cherry Lips   *Continuation*  It took forever to start. We talked about anything while waiting. It finally started, but we just kept on talking with each other. It was fun. :D Soon afterwards tho, Gela and I started to get really cold. x_x Again, Franco offered Gela his coat, but still she refused. :P The soup came, and Gela and I were happy because it was hot. Other than that, the soup sucked.. It was gritty. >_> CJ had this thing for the butter, so we told him to get the three extra ones from the three unoccupied seats at our table. :P Of course, he didn't get them. Then this dude came up to us and asked us if we wanted to get our pictures taken while there was no line. So we did. Camilla was first w/ her date, then Racine. When the photographer called Frederick to join her in the pic, he called him an escort. Then Racine was like, "Escort?" So I said, "Security!" ":P Gela was the first to get their pictures taken with her date. Then it was my turn. I got four poses because I was stag. :P After those pics, we got a barkada pic, then one with our bodyguards. :D After the pics, we went back to the hall, and wow! Dinner was there, waiting for us. I felt bad after dinner bacause I was the only one who finished all of my food. >_  After dinner, there was dancing! Actually, we didn't dance at first because we were pratically blinded by the disco lights. x_x But as more and more people started to dance (and much prodding and convincing), we decided to join in. We just swayed at first. Then I started to dance (tried is more like it), then we were swaying with style! :P Then Franco suddenly started to dance! XD But he got a headache soon afterwards. Turns out he was actually a bit sick, but he still went to the prom (AWW GEL!! XD). There was a time for slowdance, but it was only ONE SONG. O_o Gela and Camilla took of their shoes after jumping around a bit. Racine and I kept our shoes on. My shoes were comfortable enough to jump around in. The guys sat down near where we were swaying, and I noticed that they were looking and Gela's and Camilla's feet! :P It was so weird.   The awarding came next. I was a bit bummed because they didn't have a stag of the night award. :P I think I know who should have won it. (Joanna Feliciano!) The Prom Queen wasn't who everyone was expecting (at least not part of the group everyone was expecting), so that was cool. Some people still danced afterwards, but we decided to hang out in the lobby. The lobby was filled with parents waiting for their daughters/sons. Not to mention there was another school having their prom in the hall next to the one we were using. We were all tired, so we just sat down, waving good-bye to those leaving while talking. I'm not sure if it was Franco or CJ who left first, but after CJ left, Camilla went upstairs. Gela, Racine and I stayed in the lobby waiting for Frederick's family to pick him up. They came after and hour or so, and when I saw his brother, I thought he was MY brother! Geez, they looked so alike. Thinking the night was over, I started for the elevators, but Racine started yelling. "He forgot his glasses!! O_o" I grabbed them and ran (as if I could run in that dress. >  Phew~! I don't think I should add anything else. I might end up writing a story.. O_o

       Listening to: Maksim ~ Hana's Eyes   Ok ok, my description of the prom on my previous post was completely uninspired. :P So here goes:  I got to the hotel first. While we were still driving around outside, I couldn't bring myself to think that  that  was the Manila Hotel. In my head I was thinking,  Isn't this supposed to be a five star hotel or something?  Honestly speaking, it looked like a big motel from the outside. :P But once we drove into the driveway, boy was I surprised! Inside the lobby, we met up with Tita Lulu, who was basically the big honcho on organizing the prom. While they were talking, (my parents and Tita Lulu) I decided to walk around. The Lobby had many red sofas and even a band playing classical music. Plus a chandelier. Anyway, I went to the Polka Ball to have a sneak peak of where the prom would be. I wasn't too impressed tho. The first thing I saw when I went inside was the ceiling. Sure, it had chandeliers too, but some of the lightbulbs were busted, and the ceiling was dirty. With cobwebs and unidentified sticking objects. There were more tables than I expected, but the stage sucked. O_o Then I noticed the carpet. I was wearing the platforms my auntie gave me, and when I stepped on the carpet, I felt like I was sinking! >_>; It was that soft. Soft.. But it had all these black spots on it. O_o Like bubblegum or something. After that, I went back to the lobby where my parents were still talking. We went to our room after checking in. Room #1013 on the 10th floor. :D The room was very comfortable. We got a view of the ocean and the swimming pool. :P  After a while, Gela and Camilla showed up at the room (after much texting and excitement from yours truly). They told me that the beauty dude was there, so I took a shower and went down to get transformed. >_> I brought my mom with me, and when we got there, Gela was just getting finished. The mommies started talking and stuff, and after a while, Racine showed up with one of her mommies. Then it was Camilla's turn to get pretty, then mine. While I was in transformation, Gela, Camilla and Racine went to Racine's room to get her dress. Then Camilla's mom came, and so the room was filled with mommies. :D Then Racine got pretty, and it was time for the prom.  While I was running around, going upstairs and downstairs getting all my stuff, Gela's date came and they registered and went inside. Before that tho, I was able to get some pictures of us. We waited in the lobby for Camilla's and Racine's dates, but then Gela texted, telling me to get over there with her. :P I then realized that I was the expendable one because I didn't have a date. Anyway, I went there and registered; got inside and met Franco. He was nice; he talked, and when Gela was getting noticably cold, he offered his coat (numerous times!), but Gela refused. (aw...) The conversation was just getting started when Camilla came in with her date, CJ.  Hmmm, approved!  I thought as I looked at Franco and CJ. :P Honestly, that was what I was thinking then. I asked about Racine, and it turned out she was still waiting for her date, Frederick. I went to the lobby, and said "Moral support has arrived!" Luckily, we didn't have to wait for a very long while. He came after a few minutes ( Approve approve! ) and it was to the prom for us.   *note* My post was WAY longer than this... but it got cut off. n_n;; I type to much when I'm narrating something. I'll just post the rest next time. My mom's being crappy and telling me to get off the computer. *note2* Again, I'm stuck in a bad situation with my mom. x_x Why is this happening?

       Listening to: .hack//SIGN ~ Aura   Prom is over.  How was it? It was better than I expected; I wasn't a burden to my friends (I hope I wasn't), but I didn't get left out either. The thing that bummed me the most was that there was no Stag of the night award. Yeah, it's shallow, but I just wanted to show some certain people that going stag on the prom isn't the end of the world. So yeeeah.. I felt a bit biased when there was no award at all. But moving on... I'll try posting some pics some time. :D

       Listening to: Dido ~ White Flag   Prom Countdown: 2 days  Things are getting better. (He heard my prayer!) Mom and I went shopping in Ever, and I ended up getting a pair of capri denims because all of the pants I tried on didn't fit. O_o Made me wonder if I was getting fat.. I was actually there to get a manicure/pedicure for my prom, but there were too many people in David's Salon. It wasn't a complete waste though as I found a hairstyle while flipping through a magazine. My mom stole the page it was on. n_n;; Not much happened today.. *shrugs*

       Listening to: Goo Goo Dolls ~ Name   Prom Countdown: 3 days  I am in a slump. I feel lost. No direction. No destination. Not even a northern star to guide my way. (As if I could even find it) I'm just.. so... ergh.  I had a dress rehearsal with my mom last sunday. When I was wearing everything, I was just looking at myself in the mirror. I told her I wanted to win the Stag of the Night award, and she said nothing. Not even a nod. She just looked at the dress. She didn't say  anything . It was so horrible; even a shred of recognition would have been ok, but she showed nothing. I took my dress off and hung it in my brother's closet. As I wiped the make-up from my face, I couldn't help but wonder if I really am the source of all her stress. Looking back on the past week, it doesn't look good at all. She doesn't speak to me. She doesn't greet me when I come home and greet her. Geez, not even at the dinner table. I can't help but think that she hates me or something. I know I'm probably over reacting, but with the way things are...   God, please prove me wrong.

       Listening to: Alanis Morissette ~ Uninvited    Prom Countdown : 9 days  Everyone (almost everyone) in my batch has the prom fever! Lately I've only been hearing about prom dates, prom dresses, make up and all that.. stuff. I'd say crap, but in a few days I might have the fever too. > not  going to the prom feel. Like Gretchen. She wasn't allowed to go the prom. That really sucks. She barely gets to go out with us, and now she doesn't get to go to the prom? Geez. She better go to the Grad Ball. *mumble mumble*  Oh! Tomorrow is Thursday... I'm getting my teeth tomorrow! XD Right now, I've two gaps on the upper teeth.. > long  time ago, but it got posponed because my dentist was pregnant and gave birth. 0_o I'll be getting 2 other teeth extracted after the prom tho. How ouch. Then I'll get braces. Meh.  ERGH!! I'm in such a thing situation with my mom right now. I mean, I know I failed my Trigo test. Nearly everyone did! But I passed Pinoi with a decent grade! And I got the highest in AP in my class! But she still grounded me. (Sorta grounded me. I don't care; she grounded me!!) I mean, she didn't even give me a shred of consideration as to how hard the tests were.  Now that she has High Blood Pressure, she acts like everything I do stresses her out.   *sigh* Seriously, that's not fair. She's still my mom, and I still love her, but the way she's treating me isn't fair at all.  Sometimes, I don't even know why I try.

       Listening to: Bone Thugs feat. Mariah Carey - Breakdown   Dude! I just got back from my week stay in Iriga.. Actually, we arrived this morning at like 2:50, and I didn't fall asleep until around 3-4. And that was after a 9 hour drive with three people in the back with me.. Not exactly the most comfortable trip I've been on..  Anyway, New Years was ok. Tristan moped the most. Agh, it was so thing.. I didn't know what to say to him because I didn't know what he could do. I hate it when people bury themselves in depression. We didn't have any fireworks. Nor any torotots. We had a quiet New Years. And it was quite boring. We had dinner with the family at my Lola's house, but only my younger cousins and I stayed up to greet the new year. I wore stripes and jumped as much as I could. n_n;;   While I was in the province, I got my prom dress altered for only 50 pesos. 0_o That's less than a dollar. I also found a comfortable pair of prom-able shoes. So now all I need is a small bag and a shawl. But my mom wants me to wear a boa instead of a shawl. 0_o I guess that would be ok.. I'd have to see it first. n_n;;  Not much happened in the past week. Just played RO and was lazy.. n_n;; Eck, I'll post tomorrow. I've got school tomorrow.. >< I hope they don't show us our test results. I might die of a heart attack.

       Listening to: All the People in the World ~ Some guy named 'Safri Duo' I think   Phew. The previous problem was resolved. :) I'm glad.  Today was weird. I stayed up really late last night because we had no school today, so I ended up getting out of bed at around 12 noon. I actually woke up at 9, but it took me three hours of initiative, going back to sleep and thinking of getting up to actually drag myself off the bed. I went online after eating lunch. At 4pm we went to Church because of Ash Wednesday. I almost passed out at mass. O_o I can't really remember it, but we were standing for quite a while, and my chest was starting to ache. Then I got really light headed, and I had to just sit down. Thing is, this isn't the first time this has happened to me. So now, my mom thinks that I'm anemic, because she's anemic. Though it is a possibility, it doesn't sound right. I mean, just because I get light headed when I stand up for a long time doesn't mean that I'm anemic... right?  But enough of that. The only way to really find out is for me to get a blood test. Yikes.

       Listening to: Duncan Sheik ~ Barely Breathing   I don't know who is correct. I don't know if what I did was correct either. I did what I thought was right at the moment, but now I realize that a moment can pass by without you even knowing.  We all made decisions, but not all decisions we make are the right ones.   I'm stepping out of the ring. This isn't my fight, but in reality, this never was a fight to begin with. I'm sorry I blew this whole thing out of proportion; making it ridiculously worse. I'm sorry if I coached you on, I'm sorry if I put you down. I'm sorry if what I did made you cry.  My dad was right when he said that this was childish. Friends shouldnt be fighting over petty things. So I'm letting this go. What you do is your decision.

I called my friend's guy...friend, an ass. Well, it's not really that bad, but I guess it was so sudden that even I was surprised.  I kind of regret it now; after talking to my parents about it, I guess I was too righteous. But still, someone needed to push down his pride. In my humble opinion, he was getting too high on himself.  Now, what's done is done. Can't change that. I just hope his groupies don't gang up on me. n_n;

I haven't told them about my wallet tho. I'm still hoping I'll find it. >_> Plus I don't want to get in trouble.  Meh, not much has happened lately.  Mirodo>> Eeek!

       Listening to: Ghost in the Shell : SAC ~ Inner Universe   Wow. Fair is over. Let's recap.  First day was alright. There wasn't a lot of people yet because it was Friday, and everyone's bolyets still had school. I didn't do much until the Art Attack started. We had to wait a while because it didn't start on time. >_> By the time it was our turn, it was soooooooo hot! x_x We had to do an art attack about Osama Bin Laden. The other sections got F4, Uncle Sam and Sadako/Samara from The Ring. We were only given 10 minutes to do it; 7 minutes to make it, and 3 minutes to clean up. Thankfully we actually finished it, but afterwards I was so tired... x_x I went to the MMA to rest, then I found out that my MP3 Player broke! > _> After that we went to the Baila. It was ok. Camilla and Racine slept over. I didn't sleep until 3am.  Second day was ok at first. I promised myself I'd be more careful with my things after my MP3 Player broke, but lo and behold, I lost my wallet that day. I don't care about the money that was in it; I just want the wallet with my friends pictures, my smal keepsakes.. Shit. Fredrick and some other AC guys went to the fair that day. They didn't stay for the Band Aid tho. I also missed the SHS Chorale concert because I didn't have any money.  Later on in the evening we watched the Band Aid. Was ok. I slept through part of it, but we stayed 'till the end. ._. Most of the people left after Rivermaya presented. Yeah, it was insensitive. But we stayed. :D  Went home afterwards, and slept.

But my parent's would kill me first. >  I haven't been eating lately. O_o I'm not on a diet or anything, I just haven't been really hungry lately. I skipped lunch today, and I'm still running.

I'm staying at Camilla's house because he's going to stay in the hospital and there will be no one in the house with me.  I'm scared.  *today's post* I just found out this morning that the surgery will be on one of her ovaries. They found a growth, and they're going to remove it this afternoon.

       Listening to: Believe in Heaven ~ Miki Shinichirou   Feeling weird lately. =/ Lot's of stuff on my mind.  I've been thinking about summer. Right after my tests we're going to go to our province in Bicol, namely Iriga City. We're going to stay there for roughly 10 days, then we head back to the city. Then we leave for Virginia on April 14 or 16, I'm not really sure. We're going to stay there for about a month I think. O_o We head back in May, but we're still going to have a stop over in Hawaii, where we'll stay for about a week. Then it's back to the Philippines. Phew, this summer will be pretty busy. I'm a bit scared tho. With all the terrorist attacks happening, I can't help but think... Nevermind. I'm sure you get my drift.   I've also been thinking about my future. I'm seriously considering going into the ROTC Scholarship for college. I join, then they pay for my college, and they also give me an allowance. But I have to train in ROTC. Plus, the course has to be something useful to the Military, like communications, or international/asian studies, medicine or whatnot. =/ But after college, I'll automatically have a job in either the Navy, Air Force, or Marines for 4-6 years. I'll probably be stationed somewhere, especially if it's the NROTC(Navy ROTC), maybe Europe, or Asia. I dunno. After that time, I can choose either to stay, or quit. *sigh* Seems like so much to absorb.  It weirds me out. I can't imagine myself all grown up.  Maybe my sudden serious thinking is because I fell down the stairs this morning. I was sprawled on the landing, and I laid there for maybe 3 minutes. Our house is dangerous! x_x Our stairs are wood, and my mom waxes and cleans it to no end! That's why so many people fall down the stairs in our house. >_>

XD We went to Tomas Morato afterwards; it's this trippy food strip and ate at Teriyaki Boy. We got to ride in their new car!! It's a Chevrolet!! Cooool. Teriyaki Boy was this cool Japanese Restaurant with a call button for the waiters. They were also playing japanese songs. After eating, we saw one of the players of the Ateneo basketball team. We was like, 6'3 or something! Geez!  We went back to Camilla's house after that. We watched more SM LADS. :)) Gela and Karina went home soon after, and we went to sleep. This morning tho we watched like, 6 episodes of .hack//SIGN. Wahaha. I went home at 12 noon. Fuuuun. :D  Oh yeah. I can go to forums again!! And I can see my tag-board! Happpoooy! ;P

One reason would be because we're visiting my brother in Virginia this summer. He's already been there for over six months, so I'm actually looking forward to seeing him again.

       Listening to: My cousin snoring. Kekekekeke.   A few days ago, we went to Atlantic City, New Jersey, then New York. Then just recently we went to Luray Caverns. Here's the scoop:  Atlantic City  First, we went to Atlantic City to celebrate my uncle's 24th wedding anniversary. The car ride was uneventful. (Mainly because I slept thru a lot of it) We drove through Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, Pensylvannia, and NJ. O_o I'm not sure about the order. When we got to NJ, it was so cold! O_o Even colder than Virginia! XD After settling in our rooms for a bit, we went to a casino owned by Mr. Trump.. The guy from the reality tv show 'The Apprentice.' Of course, my cousin, my brother and I weren't allowed to go to the casino. So our parents gave us 20 dollars each to spend in the arcade. XD We  only spent around 5 dollars each. But still we had fun. Our parents had fun also, but they either lost some money or broke-even. Surprisingly, someone hit on mom. Again. O_O  Anyway, we were supposed to go to the boardwalk afterwards, but it was raining, so we just went straight to the Inn. They had an SNES Emulator on the TV (7$ per hour), which my cousin and I played until we fell asleep.  New York  The next day we drove to New York! We got lost on the way there, then we got stuck in morning traffic. XD We went to Times Square, and we saw the Naked Cowboy! :D :D :D It was so cool to be there, even if there were so many people. But when we were looking for a parking space, this guy tried to charge us 44$ for an hour!! O_O That set us on a bad mood. But we cheered up after eating at this small Italian Resto. The owner was impressed at auntie's Italian, so he gave us a hefty discount. n_n Afterwards, we walked 12 blocks to get to the Empire State Building! x_x But when we got there, we found out that we had to wait an hour just to get inside. >_> So we chilled at a Starbucks. I drank the Strawberries and creame.. Yum. We walked 12 blocks back, and we came across a comic shop! I was in heaven, checking out all the comics and manga, but I didn't get to buy anything. *pout* After that, we drove home.   Luray Caverns  The day after that/yesterday, we went to Luray Caverns! The drive there was very serene, because we drove through the countryside. I saw horses, cows, and barns. The cavern was reaaally fun. There was this one part where there was a puddle of water that reflected the ceiling perfectly. It was so beautiful. The deepest part of the cavern was 160 ft, where there was an organ-thing which used the stalagtites to make music! O_o It used rubber plungers to lightly tap the stalagtites to create notes. It was wonderful to hear. Then there ws a wishing well as we were going up. I didn't have any US coins on me, so I threw in two 5 peso coins. XD  When we got out, there was a garden maze nearby. So my cousin and I went through it. (We got discounted because the registrar thought I was below 13 years old. x_x) There were gnats everywhere, but we had a lot of fun running around the maze and finding the 4 goals. There was this one point were we met up with 3 guys who started whistling when they saw us. O_o We eventually found our way out, with four goal stamps. After that, we drove home, and again, I slept through most of it.  Today  Nothing much happened today. We went to Jeth's college to fix his application for summer classes. I saw my first squirell! XD We stayed in McDo for nearly an hour and a half, and went grocery shopping after dropping Jeth off at his dorm. My cousin and I dug up her old NES, and now there are three screens in her room. n_n;;

I've only been here for five days, but it seems like I've been here for a long time already. I miss my house. And my room. And how I could stay online all day. XD But here I have to use it late at night. It's funny tho. This vacation feels like it's trying to pry me away from my online persona, but here I am, clinging to dear life. Lol!  All we've been doing lately is going to different malls (which are really big and nearly deserted, compared to the Philippines at least) and ending up not buying anything. =S But I've already gotten some stuff. I got new shoes, a manga (Zodiac PI... it was an impulse buy), and a frog lamp... I also got a jr bow and arrow set. XD But along with my new stuff, these horrible little sores developed around my lips... >  The weather has cleared up since my last post. My last post it was raining and the wind was blowing in all directions.. but now it's sunny; you only need a light jacket. Well, I need a light jacket at least.  Lots of our plans have changed. I don't think we're going to Canada anymore; the uncle we were supposed to stay with is going to the Holy Land and to a tour of Europe for his wedding anniversary. The uncle we're staying with now is having his wedding aniv. this week, and we plan to go to Atlantic City! O_o  Another one of our plans have changed also. I might not go to college in the US afterall.

       Listening to: Dive ~ Maaya Sakamoto   I'm sooo tired. Why?  I watched "The Passion of The Christ" today. I cried through more of half of the movie. I guess that's what tired me out the most. Thinking about it also has left me sapped. But what do I think about the movie? I can't really say. Mom doesn't understand why Jesus had to suffer so much, and why God let him suffer. Dad on the other hand feels angry overall. He was especially angry at the Pharisees. As for me, I really don't know how to react. I feel guilty, yes, but not as guilty as I thought I would feel.  I wonder. If I was in the shoes of the Jews, would I believe in Jesus? I wonder if I am strong enough to stick it out with him, or would I deny him like Peter? I compare it to having a person with a gun come to me and ask me if I believed in God. There are only two answers. What would I do? Of course, I can't say; it's one of those things that you'll only know if it were to happen. And of course again, I would rather not have that happen.   Right now, I have a headache. Crying really does tire me out.

       Listening to: Misfits ~ Third Eye Blind   When I opened the newspaper and checked the movie schedule, all I saw showing was "Passion of The Christ". The first thing that popped into my mind was,  "Why do these people want to watch it in a movie theater?? They're obviously going to be fazed out afterwards, plus they'll be crying through out the movie."  Yes, this is the perfect time to show it because it's Holy Week. In fact, we already have a pirated DVD of it. But I ask myself; am I ready to watch it? A comment that I've heard about it is,  "Agony in the Garden pa lang, magi-guilty ka na."   LT: "You'll only reach the Agony in the Garden, and you'll already feel guilty."  Agony in the Garden is in the beginning of the movie. So I've been thinking. Am I ready to wake myself up from the illusion that is life? Afterall, I believe that Jesus died to save us. Am I ready to realize first hand how much in debt I am to Him? Seeing it first hand is different from reading it. To actually see a person, even more so Jesus, being tortured and beaten to high hell is agonizing. But what more to know that the person did it all for you. I have mixed feelings because yes, I do love Him, but I also rely on myself a lot, often forgeting about God.  It's like slapping yourself and saying, "You're only human." Which we all are.

       Listening to: Opening ~ Trigun   Hmm. I'm back from the province. Eating Buko Pie at the moment. :P  My stay was fun; all we did was play video games. We didn't get to play RO tho because up till now it's down. We played Tenchu: Wrath of Heaven, Guilty Gear XX, Robotech, Twisted Metal: Black, and I even started playing Diablo 2 on Tristan's computer. XD

       Listening to: The various sounds of the Internet Cafe   I never thought this would happen, but my computer died! :( A virus attacked and killed it!! So now I'm in an internet cafe.. *sigh* My brother is fixing it now, and he says it's awful. And I'm much pissed because everyone says it's my fault. My family has blamed me for putting the computer into a coma. But honestly, I haven't downloaded anything! >   I hope my brother can fix the computer without losing all my stuff.

       Listening to: Fiona Apple ~ Across the Universe   After roughly 24 hours in the air, I'm back home, sitting in front of my spy-ware ladden PC. *sigh* Will format later. Anyway, the flight back from Honolulu was horribly tiring. We were delayed an hour, because the plane wouldn't fly. O_o After 7 hours, we arrived in Narita Airport. We saw former president Ramos there. =P I wanted to stay longer there, but nay, we had to go home. I missed it much.  On to spy-ware... I hate the horrid things. Trojans, key-loggers, hackers. Gah. I'd chop their hands off at the chance. *chop chop chop* XD

       Listening to: TV in the background   We went to the Arizona Memorial a few days ago. It was really depressing there. Before we actually went to the memorial, they showed us this video clip/short documentary about the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was so sad to watch. I can't imagine getting caught in the middle of an attack like that. The thought scares me.  Recently I went to Borders! Borders is a bookstore here, and it's paradise. Soo many good books to read, and they don't mind if you get a book and plop yourself down on the floor somewhere. I could stay there for a day and be happy. *daydreams*  I'm coming home on wednesday. I have a lot to catch up on.

       Listening to: The wind in the trees...   I wrote this while I was flying to Hawaii:  My last day in Virginia was pretty boring until Vanessa came home from VTech. We talked mostly about buying Jeth's car. Tee hee. After a while, Patrick, one of Jeth's first friends when he got to Virginia, came over. While he and Jeth were looking at pics he took, Maelle and I were in Vanessa's room, messing around with her uniform hats and canteens. We had so much fun! Patrick ended up stayin for dinner, and after dinner we went out to Baskin Robbins to buy ice cream. Vanessa drove Jeth's car, which was manual, and it's probably by the grace of God that I'm still alive today. Jeth and Patrick, the "Stick Masters", were supposed to teach her how to drive manual. When we finally got to Baskin Robbins, we each got lots of ice cream. Yum. =) Surprisingly, Maelle finished hers last. :O We got a gallon of gas, then we ran an errand for my aunt. We were supposed to just buy dishwashing liquid, but we ended up staying there for a while. Vanessa, Maelle and I were just staring at all the facial products there were. O_o When Jeth finally called us to find out where we were, I expected them to be in the electronics section or something, but lo and behold, they were in the candy section. XD  Jeth drove us home from there. It was a pretty smooth ride. We watched American Idol while Jeth fixed Maelle's computer. Jeth left his computer to her. *pout* Oh well. We played cards afterwards. Texas Holdem, Egyptian Poker.. well, I forgot the names. Patrick left at about 10pm. I wonder if he'll visit us in the Philippines.  At the airport today I tried to convince Uncle Ernie to visit us in December. I threatened to spam his e-mail if he didn't. XD  Well, I'm off to Honolulu. I wonder if Chloe still remembers me.. *shudder*

       Listening to: Opening of Roswell ~ Dido   It didnt work out. Jeths coming home with us. It was a big, expensive gamble, and we didnt win. So, hes coming home with us now. Hes leaving his computer to Maelle, but hes taking the monitor, the hard disk and the DVD writer. I really dont know how to react. My dad keeps on asking me for my reaction, and I seriously dont have one. All I have is the anxiety that the same thing can happen to me.

       Listening to: The Disney Channel   I'm really homesick. I miss my friends. I miss my room. I miss my internet connection. I miss Photoshop. ;O;  Today we went to watch a movie. We got there early tho, so I was able to go to a comic shop! I bought the first manga of Gravitation. :P At the theater, my parents and my brother watched Troy, while Maelle and I watched Mean Girls. It was pretty funny. Our movie ended an hour before Troy did, (we even started before they did) so we had to get picked up early. After that, I hung out with Maelle's neighbors. They had a bonfire, and it was pretty cool, considering bonfires I'm familiar with usually has my dad burning a grass field near our house. :O Anyway, we had smores and watched them play Mortal Kombat 3. SNES. Hmmm.  We leave for Hawaii next week, May 19th. Then we go back to the Philippines probably on May 26th-28th, and before I go back to school, we're going to Iriga! O_o Still a lot of travelling in store for me..

I'm really worried about my future. I don't know anything about what I want! >  Then, there's the Presidential Elections in the Philippines. O God, please help our country.  And, there's the War in Iraq. I believe in the cause, but it's so hard because moral is low... and I know people who are there,  right now .  The Iraqi prisoner torture, the ambushes..   It's just so SCREWED!! I hate how everything seems to be so damned screwed. I hate how ass presidents are elected, how people die over stupid beliefs, how evil always seems to get back at the good. It's so horrible, it makes me angry and sad at the same time.  I hate how human we can be.

O_o She gives me evil looks, and always looks over my shoulder, like the devil is suddenly going to spawn from me or something. I really would care less, but she's my class adviser.. >_>  Gah. I know I promised myself I'd make this year count, blah blah blah. But you know me. It's back to my old tactics. n_n;; Gaaaaah. I suck. =P

In my mind I'm so liberal and 'free'. What the hell am I thinking?? I'm just full of hot air! Once I step out into the real world, lo and behold. I freeze. Nothing is real. I'm such a coward!  I'm like a Mime. I've put myself inside an invisible box. But I can't get out.

       Listening to: Faster ~ Third Eye Blind   I have music again. n_n I really need to buy their album. Also Portishead. *nod*  I just finished .hack//SIGN today. I was thinking. What if later on ni the future, 'The World' really came to be? Or at least something like it? Not necessarily with evil entities and wishes and hacking, but more of a completely 3D MMORPG. Of course I'd play it (or at least try to); there's no question. I was wondering tho if I'd actually lose myself to it. I wouldn't be surprised.  Online personas are like second lives. That's what I think. I mean, when I go online, I can be a completely different person. I have different friends, different opinions, different attitudes. There's me, and there's online me. I love going online. I'm part of many online communities, forums, sites, and I've met so many nice people through this. But I've also met my own share of arses. That doesn't hold me back tho. It's like, going online is like an RPG game. Going out, meeting people, interacting. You can be any hero you want. You can be you, you can be typical, you can be neutral, you can be misunderstood, you can be plain ebiiil. Maybe it's this about the internet that has me so drawn to it: Being an unmasked (yet masked) person you can't (or plain aren't) be in real life. I admit, I do not have a nice, thriving social life. I keep in touch with more people who live in different countries than I do in my own. Honestly, I feel so spaced from the people in my own country than with those elsewhere. Yeah, it worries me like hell, and it's horrible when I know nothing about those close to me. I feel so.. different. And I space myself from others because I feel so close, yet so far. Physically, I'm here, but socially, I'm somewhere else. It's stupid, now that I think about it. Sometimes, you just want someone to talk to, but you don't know who.

       Listening to:   I'm feeling much better than a few nights ago.   We had our first class of sex education today. The akwardness. We're not allowed to talk about abortion, contraceptives, rape, ect ect ect tho. We have to look at it from a Christian point of view. It's not that I oppose this way of seeing things, but it's sort of like sheilding us from the truth? I think I expected it to be more liberal.

       Listening to: Nothing   I need a hug.  Lately, when I get home, I feel like I've been completely trampled underfoot. I've been filled with thoughts that run thru my mind at blinding speed. It's crazy. I think I'm going crazy.  I saw a woman this afternoon. She was walking down the street naked. As the car sped by, my heart. It twisted. It moaned and creaked. I didn't dare to look back. Someone please just stab me repeatedly! Stab me in the back and leave me to die.  I hate how so many things can make me feel bad about myself.  So many things make me feel so frustrated. Sometimes up to the point where I can't stand it at all! My mind goes into ultra frustrated mode, and I go crazy! I just have to get away, just get away, but I end up in my room where I push the frustration down, and I go back. I never ever get rid of it, I just stuff it under my bed. I can never get rid of it. It's always there.

The fact that I'll be graduating next year still hasn't settled in yet.  Since my comp died, I've had a lot more time to myself. Good when reading. Bad when not. Like I've said before, I think too much.  I just realized... once I get my braces, I'll be the dorkiest girl in school. Hmm. Not like I care. Not like it matters.

       Listening to: Puddle of Mudd ~ Blurry (Acoustic)   When two friends fight, what should one do? It sucks to get stuck in the middle. It hurts to see people who aren't even part of the whole thing (no matter how small it may be) get affected. It's hard watching&nbsp;two of your closest friends fight. So I say this.  For God's sakes, GROW UP! You're both 16 for crying out loud, do you still need us to fix things up for you two?&nbsp; Nagpaparinig sa blog;  Yelling at each other thru YM Stats...&nbsp;Well&nbsp;hot damn, talk about maturity.&nbsp;Talk to each other!

       Listening to: The same song as last night, and the night before that.   I have braces now. O_o  But besides that, I haven't said anything about my retreat to Tagaytay with my class. Overall, I had a very nice time there. It was fun bunking with everyone in one room, even if it meant being flashed by a classmate, or talking about things we really shouldn't have been talking about. *coughsexcough* XD XD Of course, our facilitators weren't very encouraging either. Brother Pao and Brother Bernard were back with a vengance, and this time with a new sidekick, Brother Mike. And yeah, they acted as gay as ever. But what the hell, it was still fun. The food was great too. :D Good thing we only stayed for three days, or I seriously would have gained weight. The bathroom. Ah. Many things happend in the bathroom. It was the place where we all met one way or another. My classmates actually gave each other tips on how to take a poo. O_o I dubbed it, B Cubed, or Bayanihan's Bathroom&nbsp;Bonding.&nbsp;It needs a better drainage system tho. The floor was always wet.  Anyway, the programs and activities were alright. I accidentaly fell asleep through part of the most important activity. O_o Bad Ria, bad! But I woke up just as the interacting part began. T_T I'm such a bad person.  But there were worse people than me that day. 14 unsurrendered cellphones were confiscated just as the Retreat ended, all because one of them text the incoming section. I heard they're now faced with Supervised work, and possible suspension. It's a good thing my mom made me feel guilty about bringing my phone, or else I wouldn't have left mine at home.  The way home was cold. Exremely. O_o I couldn't feel my fingers. Seriously. I had to share Guia's jacket with Racine to keep alive in the bus. The two sitting behind us actually brought out a blanket. O_O Lucky them.   That's pretty much the retreat. n_n;

Suck. O_o It's like this dull pain in your mouth; I can barely chew. I get my braces next week. *cough cough*     Ah, there's the internet again.     I went to a soiree with Camilla and Racine yesterday. Honestly, at first, it was really boring. Then it became ok, then it got out of hand, then it got scary, then it was back to ok. Sorta. XD Somethings are better left unsaid. So ANYWAY! I'm glad I went. Hihihi. *rolls eyes* XD     After the soiree Racine and I slept over at Camilla's house. Talked about the soiree, and fell asleep. :P The next morning, I could barely get out of bed. XP But of course, Camilla was already up. Racine was still snoozing. Hihi. Then after a while, Camilla came up to tell us to eat, and yeah we ate. We also watched Animax, and critisized the dubbing. It was horrible. More horrible than the defense of the panty in RO. Then Racine and I watched Jiro and Matthew kill each other in Tekken, witnessed a half nekkid Din Din and Carl, and pondered the meaning of life on Camilla's bed. We finally got to the computer shortly after that, and we got one slide finished! :D :D :D Yay for progress.     Well, I'll be gone for three days; Monday to Wednesday. I'm going on a religious retreat with my classmates in Tagaytay.&nbsp;W00tness. 'Till then I guess! =P   &nbsp;

       Listening to: Break Me ~ Jewel   I've been so swamped with school.. It's crazy.  I'm taking the UPCAT this Saturday.. I'm scared, in a not so caring way. T_T (BTW, the UPCAT is a college entrance exam. Prolly the hardest, not only because of the test, but also because of the sheer competition) Then the week after the UPCAT is exam week! Haay. If I didn't study before, I don't know how to compare how I dont' study now. It's not that I really don't care, it's just like.. I don't have any motivation. No dream. No goal. I dunno. It's like I'm letting myself get blown about by the wind? Where ever the wind may blow.  I wish I knew what I wanted from life.
