      Well, I've finally taken to reading other people's blogs and I've found that diving into the minds and lives of others can be quite refreshing.  I have also recently reviewed one of those internet profiles of a friend I thought I knew.  Apparently, I never even knew his real name and have been calling him by an alias all these years (yeah right).  His profile describes someone only vaguely like the man I thought I knew.  It's like finding out your husband is a secret agent for the CIA after 15 years of marriage - you saw the movie.    Anyway, as I am terminally honest in all aspects - even internet life (perish the thought) I find it extremely funny that we feel that we need to embellish online.  The internet has provided us with endless opportunities to communicate with our friends & loved ones, to express our ideas and beliefs, and to meet that hottie we've always dreamed of.  Trouble is, once you meet face to face you discover that you prefer the online fantasy to reality.  Oh, and I immediately deleted all quotes and quibbles from MY profile - no one would ever believe anyone is that perfect... they'd just assume embellishment. ;)

       More Ying & Yang  Reviewing my last entry, I realize that I only gave one ying & yang example.  I could give more, like how great it is that my youngest daughter is home after living with her grandmother for the past three months.  It's great having her back where she belongs, but it's not great waking up three times in the night - bottle break, potty break and day break.  She was up at 6:45 am saying "Mommy, its a little bit morning, time to wake up!"    Gotta take the good with the bad, right?    And have another cup of coffee to get me through the day.

      As I burned my tongue on my oatmeal this morning, I started thinking about how my life has lately been a pure example of ying & yang; a complete balance of good & bad.  Examples being first of all, I had to cancel a very chi-chi dinner I had planned to include a 5 course meal under a full miami moon, oceanside with 4 french wines to accompany the meal.  Masquerade, gourmet cuisine, great people - to say the least I was extremely dissapointed in what, to me, represented complete and utter failure on my part.  But then, on the day of the cancelled dinner, someone handed me an article extolling another, past event that I put together.  The writer, bless him, described the event as cozy and refreshing with the company of "gentle folk".  As, he described it exactly as I remember it - and I felt really good to know that someone else besides myself really enjoyed the fruits of my labor.  So I am once again reminded that you take the good with the bad.  Even when I am at my lowest point, it takes so little to bring me back to the sunny side of life.  Thanks, Mr. Dolen.

      Day 2.  It's so exciting!  I realized last night, while pondering today's entry, that I have actually misnamed my blog.  What I meant to call it was "Diva-lish Drivel".  However, after looking up dribble in my webster's, I realize that Dribble is exactly what I meant to say.    After all, this will be a slow and steady flow of my thoughts and afterthoughts.  So, while it won't include anything about basketball (except maybe a word or two about the WNBA Miami Sol) it really will be dribble.  Besides, drivel is such an ugly word.

      Hmm... a captive audience.  Where do I begin?  Welcome friends to my blog.  I'm very excited to have you here and hope I don't bore you to tears with my diva dribble.  Through this blog, you too can learn to be a diva ;)  So, day 1, page 1, paragraph 3.  Life on the internet begins and life as we know it is forever changed... or not.

       Raise a glass  Last night I hosted my Wine Club.  Well, its not really MY Wine Club, I just come up with the theme then plan the event, write up the invites, mail the invites, coordinate with the wine suppliers, and manage the RSVP list.  Oh, and then I host the event.  I am the "hostess with the mostess"!    Any way, last night I had high hopes of attracting over 75 people.  I was lead to believe that the suppliers had at least 60 confirmed reservations.  Suffice it to say that out of the 15 or so people there, none of them came from those 60 confirmed reservations.    Nonetheless, the wines were good - notice I used plural wines, as I did partake of more than one.  The event was a success in so much as those who attended were sophisticated and social.  Several groups of conversation developed and everyone mingled throughout the evening.   Did I mention that I did partake of plural wines? *grin*  I still have to say it... I love my  urlLink job!   And the other thing I've been waiting to say all week long -- Happy Friday!   *horns and whistles blowing in the background as I beat my drum!*   Diva out.

       Rock the Vote!  I received a very powerful e-mail this morning from a dear friend who has served in the Navy.  I'm sure he speaks for many of the men & women serving our country's military.  I'm not exactly pro-military but I certainly do value and appreciate the rights and freedom we enjoy because of their service.  So, without further ado...  Subject: right to vote!   Hey folks this is Jason. I am just sending out this little reminder that election time is almost upon us. This is a very important issue for me because i know a lot of people take our right to vote for granted. right now there are American troops fighting to protect what we have and many more (including yours truly) that have served in the military. please take the 15 minutes out of your day to register and another hour out of your day to actually vote. i would be very disappointed to find out some of you just didn't feel like it or were too busy. Imagine how bad you would feel if we didn't have that right at all.  Thanks,  Jason

       Thank you, your honor!  I have finally had my "day in court"; I think everyone should have one of these.  It's like Andy Warhol's 15 minutes of fame, except mine took about a half hour.  Without going into all the sordid details, let me just say that the judge and state attorney were not impressed with my dead-beat-dad ex-husband (my, he's earned quite a title!) and they were NOT having any of his excuses.  Lesson to any dads out there considering not paying child support: no matter how hard you try to justify not giving the mom child support money - your ass is going to jail.  That wonderful humanitarian of a judge told him to show up next week "with money or a toothbrush."  She's giving him a chance to keep his sorry ass out of jail, while at the same time getting me a little of what I'm due...that's fair.  She's my hero!

       More blogster diving goodness  While I am actually managing to get work done this Mundane, uh, Monday morning, I did click that fabulous little NextBlog button.  Its an addiction I have, I need caffeine and NextBlog every morning to get me going.  I don't know how that button works, or how it selects which blog to go to next, but today there was a sort of theme woven into the melange of goodies.  I found one blog totally devoted to the daily doses of medication and inevitable deterioration of one woman's 14 year old cat, as it dies from some form or another of cancer.    Then there was  urlLink Not my dog , which didn't mention anything about a dog.  She has a cat though, that kept her up all night recently.  Anyone who's ever hated their cat due to an all night howling session can relate.  And finally,  urlLink Jason's Blog , which didn't mention any animals at all, but has a picture of a dog's tongue hanging out of a huge gaping dog mouth.  All made for some good reading today.  This blog is turning into a blog journal of my blog travels.  Geez, have I no life of my own to blog?  Oh, wait - I went to a wine tasting on Saturday night.  There, I do have a life.  Of course, it was free, at a liquor store.  Not much more than a poorly disguised marketing ploy to sell liquor.  At least my events are social and entertaining - and you get more than a thimbleful of the stuff.  My event is next Thursday, can't wait to see how that goes.  Oh, crap its this Thursday... with only 5 RSVPs. *gasp*  Undaunted, I'm going to have a good time no matter how many people show!

       Instant Gratification   That little counter thing in the corner made my whole day.  Its up to a whopping 10! Hey, it may not seem like much to you, but I'm easy to please.  I'm a girl of very simple needs.  Plus, Leann left me a message on my tag board.  This is a gold star day! :)  Well, technically she left a message for that little slut in the mini skirt.  *sigh*   But hey, sex sells, right?

       Prouder than a...  Ok, so I can't think of a saying that would complete that.  All I can think of is "happier than a pig in --" but this is a clean blog so I can't complete that one.  Anyway, I am so proud of myself.  I have managed to dress up my page quite nicely today.  As we tour the page, you will notice in the upper left hand corner my new counter.  My pathetic hunger for recognition requires that I know exactly how many people have visited my page.  The down side to this is that this could end up like the little red 0 on my answering machine.  Screaming at me the blatant fact that NO ONE has called. *sigh*  Also, you will see the sexy little weather pixie, announcing the perfect tropical weather here in sunny South Florida.  From what I've seen, the tramp changes her outfits according to time of day, temperature and weather patterns.  Pretty clever.  And did I mention that she's looks just like me!  Then, just below the tramp -- I mean the weather pixie -- I've placed a Tag Board.  Here you can give me your thoughts, comments and other worthless... uh, that is...worthwhile input.  Just more blogging fun than any one person should have in just one day!  On that note, I'm going home.  Blogging on hold till Monday.

       Tired, but smiling   Perched on a bar stool in a Moulin Rouge-like bar/restaurant, with drag queens and old queens milling and spilling all around me.  That is how I spent last night.  If you've never been to a drag show, let me assure you that you have not yet fully lived.    Went to a new place called Madame's last night and saw some of the most entertaining performers wearing more makeup than Tammy Faye - and looking good.  I especially liked the Bette Miller impersonator and the very large black, um, person - s/he really enjoyed singing and dancing on that little stage with the hot blinding stage lights and lively crowd pouring down on her.  My goddess friend Gloria left the bar moaning, "I can't believe I sucked face with a gay man!"  And, according to her, he was "very competent".  He admitted that, while he prefers men, the last woman he slept with glued her phone number to his coffee table.  Competent indeed.  And all this on a school night, when I knew i had to get up in the morning but didn't really care.

       One Last Post for the day...   Finally getting the chance to go out with a co-worker/friend/fellow goddess tonight.  And what could be more appropriate for us than to go to a dinner and cabaret show - drag queen style.  This should be a blast - I need a good laugh.  You know, the kind of laugh that shakes your whole body; the kind where the next day your stomach reprimands you for doing all those damned sit-ups but you were only laughing.  Laughing till your face hurts.  Then there's the meal that comes with the dinner, the great conversation and company of Gloria and the piece de resistance  *typed with a french accent*  -- this is a free meal.  There's no better dinner than a free dinner.  I'll have to put it all in my blog tomorrow.  BTW, if Andre Gide were around today, do you think he would he have written his "Journal" via blog?

       More Blogging Fun...   3 postings in one day - a new high.  That's because its August, and things move pretty slow in Miami in August.  As a result, I am able to do a little more surfing than usual, and once again my new best friend NextBlog has provided me with great amusement.  Two great blogs to check:  urlLink  Big Pink Cookie, "Taking the blah out of blog"  and  urlLink  Ginger Girl "Welcome to the Venting Zone"   where I found this quaint little mental excercise, which actually came from another site.  click  urlLink  HERE   to stretch your mental muscle.  This link actually takes you to yet another site that I rambled through on my afternoon of goofing off. *wink*  I guess I'll go look for something else to do, and get another coke - the more caffeine the better, I always say.   Oh, and another thing.  My extremely weird friend Fred Gerbilman - he's not rich enough to called eccentric - says I'm weird, which is why he loves me.  This is like the pot calling the kettle black.  He sends me some of the most bizarre links to sites ranging from mundane to profane.  But I'm the weird one.    I may have to start sharing some of the more bizarre sights/sites he sends me just to prove my point... And just to prove my point, *raising my hand with finger pointing triumphanly toward the sky* you can visit his Rant blog at  urlLink Gerbilman Rant  .    The fact that I've figured out how to add links to my page could really piss him off - this could have lots of entertainment value.

      I wonder, does it make me a bad person because I'm enjoying putting the squeeze on my dead-beat-dad ex-husband?  After 10 months of no payments in child support, we're finally going to court at the end of this month.  He now has less than 2 weeks to come up with the dough he owes me or he'll sit in jail until he pays me.  I've had 2 years of struggle - of wondering how I'll pay the rent and the day care and still manage to buy food for my two children.  In the meantime, he's living in his girlfriend's house, driving her car, sleeping in her bed and eating her food.  OK, so maybe I'm a little bitter about the whole thing.  Maybe after he married me he finally realized that SHE is his one true love and he couldn't bear to live a lie by being married to me.  Or maybe he just got in too deep and needed her to bail him out.  Well, now she may have to do just that - literally.  (Although I really hope it doesn't come to that - I would prefer getting paid.)  Does it make me a bad person?  I just want to get paid.  And see him squirm just a little.   As for my two wonderful little girls - I must say that I got the better end of this whole divorce deal.  I have the pleasure of the company of two of the most beautiful and charming little girls I've ever known.  Never mind they're my children, they are two exceptional human beings.  Every day I get more and more joy from knowing them and seeing them grow.  There is nothing more valuable to me than one of their hugs, or seeing their faces light up when I pick them up from school or grandma's house.  I know that, in spite of all the struggle and hassle and frustration that comes from being a single mom with less than adequate support from an absentee father, having them in my life makes my life worthwhile and fulfilled.

       Waxing Philosophical   Seems like I'm coming to an end of another chapter in my neverending novel of a life.  Well, actually it will end eventually - only I won't be around to comment on the final chapter.  It just feels like I've had a very rough two years, much of the drama created by my own actions of course.  And now, I'm reaching a very anti-climatic point in the story.  I can't say "ending" because that's not what it is.  Any ending is really just another beginning.  And that's where I'm at - another beginning.  Opportunity disguised as loss - I take every loss as an opportunity for something else. I've had plenty of loss these past years and I just know that its time to forge ahead into some new beginning... but what?

       Next Blog bringing the world closer together  Found another interesting blog today.  I love that Next Blog link; when I get bored at work I follow that link where ever it wants me to go.  Today, along with a really boring blog on handhelds and another one in portuguese, it took me to  urlLink  Mercury Frog   .  He's getting married in a few days, and apparently pondering the realities of grown up life.  Can't wait to hear about the big day.    Oh, and as for my cake-eating friend... apparently the bakery is closing down.

      This will be the second time I'm trying to get this blog entry in.  Yesterday I discovered, much to my dismay, that there is another blog under the same name as mine.  Can you believe it?! Only, I've spelled it differently - her version is Diva - liscious.  You can check it out if you like - she's got an interesting life and pictures to prove it.  Go to  urlLink  Diva - liscious    And, now for a little self indulgence and pity.  I've decided that life isn't finished with me yet, and I apparently have more growing to do if I'm ever to be ready for real, soul-shaking soul-mate kind of love.  And if I hear one more time that I'm a nice girl, or a good girl I'm going to scream.  All that goodness and niceness is getting me nowhere in the romance department.  I mean, really - even the most horrid, ugly troll bitches get to have boyfriends and/or husbands.  Yes, I've had a husband but that one, apparently, didn't really count.    One of my friends has reminded me that anything worth having is worth waiting for.  Easy for him to say, now that he can have his cake and eat it too.   But enough of that.  Onward and upward - and hope springs eternal.  My horoscope insists that things are looking very good for August and I'm betting the bank on it!

      Not going to dwell on what i've done... just forging ahead blindly into the possibilities. But there is hope, as he is thinking about me still.  I wanted to comment on a funny coincidence that has given me a strange perspective into a stranger's life.  a neighbor's life actually.  5 or 6 years ago, a guy tried to pick me up in a club.  He gave me his number but i left it at the bar and never called him.    I actually saw him at a few other places around town, always with a group of friends - apparently we liked the same places.  He didn't seem to remember or recognize me, and I never tried to say hello.  Now, it turns out that when I moved into my new apartment in January, I moved into HIS building.  We really do like the same places.  But being his neighbor has afforded me a greater insight into this man's life - and on a greater scale, I think into the lives of many people just like him. Young, professional, sufficiently successful, and single.  I know what car he drives - by seeing him parking in the garage one day.  I know he lives on the 23rd floor of my building, since we ride in the elevator together frequently.  He leaves for work at 8:30 and gets home around 7pm.  I've even seen him walking out of the "gentleman's club" around the corner from our building.    And finally, I've seen him with maybe 2 different women - so i've seen his taste in women too.   It's strange and deep in my heart it makes me a little sad, because I see this man's solitary life and some of its private details.  I sometimes wonder how it feels to be him - solitary -- no children, no wife.  I wonder if he's happy living alone.  Maybe he has a pet, but I've never seen him walking a dog... a cat maybe?    So many of us walk together, live together and are so alone.  We think that no one knows our sorrow or cares; we are all looking for something more.    I've still never really said hello to him.  I have no interest in really getting to know him, although he may be a very nice person.  It may be cowardice, but I'm just happy knowing his secrets.  And in some small way this makes me feel more connected to the world as a whole - it reminds me that we are all the same, we come from the same source and we are all one.

      Well, I've done the unthinkable.  I've opened up to contact with the one person who is both heaven & hell, wrapped up in one neat package.  Love and hate, together in a fiery passion... god I've missed him!  Still not sure what I was thinking when I ruined it all, or why I think I could ever fix what I f*cked up. But, onwards and upwards.  Maybe I'm just craving another escape to NY? Or maybe there really is a reason why I can't get him out of my head.  Let the ride begin...

      And another thing... how is that there are 87 million singles over the age of 18 in the US and I can't get even one of them to take me out to dinner?

      Universal Wonders  How is it that everytime I finally give up on ever hearing from someone ever again, they call?  I can't help but believe that I really do make things happen.  Just by thinking about him (and refusing to ever contact him again) the most divine man I've ever met (as close to a god as I am a goddess) dissappeared - as was his own divine right.  You know how mercurial we gods can be ;)  I gave up, and he called. My divine Diva-ness proved irresistible.

       Back in order...?   Well, I think I've got my page back in order.  If not, this may be as good as it gets for a while.   Just wanted to give thanks to my friends.  I was having one of those "poor me" moments over the weekend.  Single mom, all alone with no one to talk to, yadda yadda yadda.  I am ashamed to admit that I was feeling very down - it was really quite pathetic if I do say so myself.  But - hey - even a diva can have a moment of weakness!  Then I opened up my e-mail this morning and was reminded once again that I do have friends - really good friends that love me.  They just live to damn far away to be hanging out on my sofa every weekend.  *sign*    But thanks for the little notes and nice thoughts that you send to me.  Just to say hello, or to give me a word of inspiration - all of those little things mean a lot to me - especially after the weekend that none of you could have possible known about.  Just giving thanks because I'm feelin' the love ;)  Diva out.

       AAARRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!!   I just realized that I have lost all the work that I did on this thing!!!  Blogger did some maintenance work which caused me to get error messages on my page.  So, I downloaded the template again to fix the error.  And I lost my weather tramp, and my tag board, and my favorite links!  This is worse than someone stealing my car (although I really wish someone would) or something.    I think I need to be alone for a few minutes with my grief...  Then I will just have to rebuild.

       Happy Friday!  The diva is back... sorry for the delay.  I've been trying to get work done here in the office, while not really having any desire to get work done.  Spoke to Dee in Alybamy the other day - while she was recieving a visit from Isidore.  All is well in the D2 household.  And there have been so many distractions lately, my focus has been a little off these days.  Suffice it to say that all my efforts at destroying the pattern of "booty calls" were put on hold for a short time.  But, I'm back on track and stronger than ever  *that slight hesitation in my voice means nothing.*   I could give more sordid details, but with that  and  that weather tramp over there, I would really be pushing for an adult-rated page. *wink*  However, you will notice that I did get some surfing in, and I've added the links for your enjoyment - or not.    Many thanks to my dear friend Mona for introducing me to the newest technology.  I think I need an upgrade...  urlLink Computer Features     urlLink hooey   Diva out.

       Scary  Ok, just for kicks I decided to check out  urlLink Juan is a loser   again.  He's getting pretty scary; and what's worse is that some of his meanderings are vaguely familiar.  He's got it bad; he's an online stalker.  Lucky for both of them that the stalked is on the other side of the planet.  Its almost dark enough to be Dostoevsky, but not nearly brilliant enough.  Just the underbelly of a broken heart, exposed for all to see.    I told you,  scary .  Diva out.

       Monday again.   I wasted a perfectly good weekend doing absolutely nothing -- again.  Ah, but what pleasure I get from doing nothing.  Slept waaaay too much on Saturday and then refused to be such a sloth again on Sunday.  I actually cleaned my apartment, did some laundry and went food shopping.  Which, in mother-speak, translates into picked up so the kids can mess up, washed what will be dirty again and too small very soon, and spent money I didn't have on something that won't last more than a few days.    So, I actually did a lot of nothing for nothing.

       Cleaning House   First of all, thanks to Birth Control? for this fabulous offering.  If you love popping bubble wrap, I just know you're gonna dig this...  urlLink Virtual Bubble   Now, for the subject of the day... Cleaning House.  Has absolutely nothing to do with bubble wrap (although I did find some forgotten bubble wrap tucked away in a closet).  But that's besides the point.  For some odd reason, I don't do "spring cleaning".  The urge comes later in the year - right around now.  Or maybe its early; depends on how you look at it - half full, half empty.  So, the urge struck me Saturday and I struck back by spending about 6 hours clearing out cards, letters, old drawings from my kids, WEDDING GIFT CARDS.  Even found the bill from the hotel on the wedding night.  *sigh*    I got rid of 4 big bags of what used to be treasured memories.  Now they're just junk to load into the landfill.  And I can't tell you how gooooood it felt ripping up a few last straggling pictures of DBD.  Talk about cleaning house - that emotional closet is stripped bare now!    But I won't share too much here - just suffice it to say that I now have lots of happy memories stored away in all my little boxes that I love to collect.   And, I have empty boxes ready to collect all the happiness I have yet to create.  Diva out.

       September 11th again  There's a lot in the media this morning about remembering this day.  Some people around me are down, others appear to not even know of the significance of today (although I suspect affected appearances).  Personally, I woke up with the radio reminding me of the sadness of this day, of the impact felt by families around the world and of the continued feeling that nothing has been done still.  A friend spoke to me of the families of the victims, and those of the firefighters and policemen lost in the attacks.  He wasn't concerned with how they've all managed to go on while mouring lost loved ones.  His point was that firefighter and police families have received $900,000 in financial relief while victims' families have "only" recieved on average $100,000 in relief.  Something like that - my figures may be off.  He was disturbed at the unbalanced totals of money.  So, I'm wondering... why is it that a living family member has no dollar value.  You can't buy that loved one for any amount of money.  No decent mother would sell her child to someone (these days) no matter how many hundreds of millions of dollars you offered her.  Why is it, that once a family member is killed all of a sudden there is a dollar value placed on the life of that person?    I believe that the dollar value is not to replace the loss of that person - for no money can do that.  I think it has more to do with revenge - "they're going to pay!".  But, in the greater scope of things, that way of thinking is very base and has nothing to do with honoring the life and memory of the one lost.  It is hate and anger reacting and trying to take control of a situation over which we have no control.    It saddens me that the attacks happened and I do believe we should remember those that were lost and remember the hate that caused such actions.  Doing so may guide us all to a world where violence does not answer violence and knowledge erases hate and prejudice.    I am determined to have a good day and to be grateful for all that I have - even the challenges that cause me strife!    Diva out.

       The key to happiness  I've discovered the key to sublime happiness.  It's butter.  A little sugar never hurt either.  But, note the butter to happiness ratio... the more butter, the happier you will be.    Stay with me on this.  Just think about the last stack of pancakes you had; lots of butter, right?  And didn't you feel soooo good after wolfing down the stack?  Or that warm, flaky biscuit that you dunked in butter at the dinner table.  Complete and utter bliss.    Personally, I had the most divine croissant *using your best french accent - say craa - san"* this morning.  Not only was there butter baked in, so much so that it left my fingers glistening with the magic stuff, but I went one step further and swathed it lovingly in even more butter.  Some may say adding the strawberry jam was going to far, but I say, "You only live once!"

       Thanks, I guess...  Well, I didn't get what I wanted, but I almost got what I wanted.  Had that all important follow up hearing after last week... you know, the one where he's supposed to show up with cash in hand.  What he showed up with was a letter explaining why he didn't have cash in hand.  And another pathetic excuse, which simplified, means his needs are far more important than those of his children.  The judge was fair, as before. She accepted his offer of $500 today - before 2pm.  Then she agreed to reduce the amounts due, but the total will still be $3000 to fulfill his "purge".  So, DBD (dead-beat-dad) now has a standing appointment before the Judge of the 11th Circuit County Court for the next 10 weeks.  Fortunately, I will not have to attend.  At first I was so angry that I really wanted to bitch slap him right where he sat.  Then I got over it, took control of myself and rationalized that $500 is better than nothing.  I'm getting paid and he's out of jail, earning more money to give to me.  It works.  So, thanks, I guess...

      That weather bitch is getting more action than me!  *sigh*  Hmmm, maybe if I shortened my skirt up to there... * me reaching down and tearing strips off the bottom of my skirt, a la Ginger on Gilligan's Island style *  Had a faaabulous three day weekend wherein I fullfilled my plans of doing absolutely nothing.  Not one damn thing...  I read -- working my way through "The History of Civilizations" by Fernand Braudel -- and when reading became too tedious I napped on the sofa.  Even got in a really good two hour yoga session... and absolutely relaxing and labor-free Labor Day weekend.  The children were with Grandma and she spent the whole time spoiling them.  In all, a faaabulous weekend; or did I say that already? *grin*

       Happy Hallowe'en Everyone!  What a good morning we had in the Diva household... Leia as Jane from Tarzan (Disney's version) and Kala as a witch (again), complete with glow-in-the-dark fingernails with "Boo!" written on them.  Spoooooky.  Mom will don her wicked witch costume later today, got my magic mirror and all ready to go.  And I have to gloat about last night.  WHAT A GREAT TIME!  The Wine Club last night drew in 55 guests - most of them paying this time - for "Get a Clue".  Great wines, gourmet hors d'oeuvres and a terrific mix of people all made for such a great time.  There was a line at the wine bar last night - that was a first. And someone actually figured out the murder mystery and won a bottle of choice from our wine selection; she chose the Gallo(w), a very good choice.  After almost giving up on the whole thing, now I can't wait for next month's event.  I've selected Big Reds, and we may add a scavenger hunt to the evening.  Themes and games seem to draw a crowd.  Today the Diva will need just a little more coffee than usual to make it through to trick-or-treat time.   Diva out.

       Almost there  I know a lot of people who are counting down the days and dreading the coming of a new year.  Let me assure you that I, for one, am looking forward to getting this year over with.  This was not my best year, not my worst either.  Actually, it was pretty good now that I think of it.  Anyway, I just know 2003 will be MY year.  I'm hoping anyway.  And as my 33rd birthday rounds the corner - yes Dee, we are 33 no matter how hard you try to deny it! - as my birthday rounds the corner I'm thinking it may be time for another image update.    Yes, as the Downtown Diva I am an absolute fox *wink*, I was even called gorgeous recently.  Notice the gloating.   But, there is always room for improvement.  I'm thinking the gray needs to go, as I have probably another 30 or 40 years to sport the gray hair.  And shorter may work too.  Although, I'm kind of digging the shoulder length do.  Hmmm.  10 pounds could go away and I wouldn't miss them at all.    Change is good.  New age, new year, new me.  We're still in the planning stages, so we'll see.   Diva out.

       Update on demand  Congrats to Birth Control? for new baby steps!  Now the real fun begins (and more trips to the ER?).  I received an e-mail to please update my blog, so... I'm updating.  Went to a small but fun costume party at Debbie's on Saturday night.  Trying to figure out how to go to another party on Friday night.  I'll have to squeeze it into my busy schedule - this is the week of no free time!  Wednesday is the Wine Club event - 45 RSVP's  -  a record for the year.  Thursday is Halloween.  Kala will be a witch (again) and Leia has decided to be Jane from Tarzan instead of Princess Dot from Bug's Life.  Mom is undecided, but I have a sorceress costume from a friend.  Think evil step mother from Sleeping Beauty... oooh, maybe I'll just add a mirror as prop to the costume and that's who I'll be.    Friday I'm taking the girls - with Grandma too - to a halloween themed carnival.  And then there's the party an hour away.  Phil Berry is all grown up and having a party at his place (with roommate).  That should be interesting and hopefully amusing too.  Saturday is Hands on Miami Day.  Don't forget to click the little donate button (above left) to sponsor me if you haven't yet done so - thanks again Joe!  Saturday night is the Bug Ball, where I will be helping to pour wine for the party.  I'll be sampling a little of my own goods that night, for sure. *wink*  Sunday I'm going to try again to meet with friends for a Japanese tea ceremony - it keeps getting put off.  And somewhere in between I may actually get some sleep.  Loving life as a diva right now. *big grin*  Diva out.

       A new friend  My girls don't get visitors at our house very often.  Once we had a pool party to celebrate the end of summer and four girls came over.  That was a lot of fun and it kept both of my girls entertained for the entire afternoon.  Last night we had another such special occasion.  Kala has teamed up for a pumpkin decorating project at school, so Jenny came home with us after school yesterday.  What a great time we all had decorating two pumpkins and turning it all into a jester with a miniature puppet of himself.  Kala and Jenny came up with the idea and I added my idea of the puppet.  Two pumpkins stacked on top of each other with a mini-me stuck onto a chopstick, jutting out from the bottom pumpkin.  It really turned out nicely.  What was the nicest of all though, was working with the girls to put it all together.  And then, having all three girls running around the house, chasing each other, blowing bubbles and creating general havoc.  We had such a good time together.  And on a school night!  Jenny was trying to convince her mother that she needed to sleep over Sunday night just so the two of them could carry the pumpkin into class together on Monday morning.  Mom wasn't buying it.    Kala has such nice friends; I hope she gets to come over and play again soon.  Diva out.

       The Pinnacle of Celebrity  I'm the Administrative Diva for a gorgeous and glamorous boutique hotel on South Beach.  We are hosting MTV for the Latin VMA's, being held here on Miami Beach.  We have celebrities from all music genres, from Latin American newcomer Anastacia to Carlos Santana.  Yes, we are just that fabulous.  But all that is nothing compared to who I have discovered is being secretly stored away in one of our Boardrooms.  I found the crate this morning declaring his arrival, and I was beside myself with excitement.  Dare I even let it leak that he's here?  Mustn't... tell.... must... resist... urge... to spill it.....  Okay! I have to tell you....  HAMBURGLAR is HERE!  Its just too fabulous to keep to myself!  McDonalds has a crew here doing a commercial and working out of our Boardroom.  And they brought HIM for the shoot.    Wonder if I can get an autograph.  Diva out.

       Three to fall down  3 1/2 actually.  I have decided to get Leia a helmet.  I believe that's the only way I'm going to preserve her tender little melon (her head) from serious damage.  She is constantly falling down, and its always on her head and/or face.  Its not because she's clumsy like her mother; she doesn't trip over her own feet or walk into walls.  Ok, sometimes she walks into walls, but that's another day's topic.  She bounces, she jumps... she FLIES.  She jumps on my bed, the sofa, the chair.  And sooner or later she lands on her head.  And she hasn't yet learned that jumping leads to falling.  Last night was a perfect example.    I didn't even see her standing on our particulary bouncy chaise lounge.  She must have done what she always does -- start at the head of the chair, bounce along the length of the lounge and then dive off the end of it onto a huge cushion on the floor.  It scares the hell out of me everytime I see it, but this time I didn't see it.  And this time she missed the cushion, flew right past it head first into the wall and the base of a tall wrought-iron candle holder.    When I find her, she's lying face down, like a little doll shoved into the corner with her head pushed too far to the left.  Miraculously, she was fine.  A little scared, no real damage done.  And then, once the boo-boo was all gone and she had calmed down, we had discussed not jumping on that chair anymore.  She agrees by saying, "Ok, Mommy.  Let's go jump on your bed better."  *sigh*   Either I'm going to have a vegetable for a daughter or she's strong enough to live through a nuclear holocaust.  Headgear is the only way to be sure.

       Two to Tango   I have a new appreciation for the bandoleon.  It's like an accordian, only bigger and I guess somehow more noble.  It really does go very nicely with a piano, the Tango concert I went to taught me this.  Although, I have to say, watching the guy play the bandoleon was another form of entertainment.  Have you ever  seen  this?  It may be illegal to play this thing in public in some countries.    The musician sits on a chair, with the instrument resting on his lap.  As he moves the thing open and closed it makes a whining, yet pleasing sound.  It can be very gentle and quiet or really strong and loud.  And when it is played loud and long is when the visual entertainment begins.   As the instrument is stretched out to its limits, it becomes too much to hold on a closed lap.  Think Slinky stretched to its extreme - the center starts to droop.  To accommodate this, the player must o-p-e-n his legs w-i-d-e to support the instrument.  Then, add to that the passionate way in which he plays the sharp notes; moving with his whole body and sometimes pushing forward with his shoulders or hips.  The bandoleon singing or moaning and gasping for breath all the time.  No wonder Tango is so damn sexy... the dances were inspired by moves of the musicians!  It really was very exciting and a lesson in traditional music from Argentina and Uruguay.  Just another reason I love living in Miami.  All that culture.   Diva out.

       this just in...  So, I have a little more to say today.  I have 2 free tickets to a Tango concert/performance tomorrow night and I was a little sad because I thought that I'd have to go alone, and as we all know, it takes two to tango.    I had asked a friend who I thought would be interested in going, but since I hadn't heard back I thought I was going alone... but he IS going with me!   I can get all dolled up and go out with a friend, a male friend.  It's almost like a real date and I couldn't be more pleased.   And, I'm hoping to meet some other friends for a Japanese tea ceremony on Sunday.  It never takes much to make me happy; an e-mail here, a phone call there.  Makes me a happy little Diva.    I'm looking forward to a wonderfully busy weekend, and I wish the same to all my friends!  Diva out!

       Tired but happy  I don't know about the rest of you, but I've had the equivalent of two weeks in one.  My office has been so busy I can't keep up or keep track of it all.  I've planned a Wine Club event and sent out 500 invitations (which includes printing the invites and the labels, stuffing, licking and running through the postage meter), done my director of sales' New York sales trip expense report twice, remembered National Boss Day (2 "bosses"), put out several little fires the past three days, booked reservations for several VIP guests (and those who think they're VIP) and even got the hotel to sponsor the wine for an upcoming party at the Miami Beach Botanical Garden.    And all of that has very little to do with my personal life, which by the way, I do actually have.  I'm exhausted.  But, I'm happier than I've been in weeks.  I've got something to do every Saturday for the next 3 weeks, and some Sunday's too.  I'm looking ahead to my birthday weekend and all the arrangements I need to do.  "God" called and wants to spend my birthday with me, and its always nice spending time with him.  I'm getting more involved in volunteering and in the baby's daycare.  I'm having little bedside chats with Kala more often - real mom-daughter bonding time.  And, I'm reconnecting with some of my dearest friends that I have lost track of.  And lets not even mention all the holidays that are coming up.  I'm exhausted, but I'm happy.  Busy is good.    Diva out.

       The Glamorous Life?   I live in Downtown Miami, in the lap of luxury... on the 25th floor with a balcony overlooking Miami and the Beaches.  I have a f-a-a-a-a-bulous view of Biscayne Bay and the Ocean -- way over there on the horizon.  Miami is beautiful and draws all the beautiful people.  Movies are made, videos are shot and we are all dripping with glamour.  There are advantages to being a Downtown Diva.  With that in mind, let me tell you about last Friday night.  A production company has been filming "Fast and Furious 2" for months now, in and around Miami.  They've been filming in my 'hood for the past few weeks.  Yes, glamorous.  Glitzy and fabulous.  Haven't actually seen that yummy Diesel guy, but he's hangin' in my 'hood for filming.    And, last Friday they were filming until the wee hours of the morning - actually they didn't even start until 11pm.  How do I know this, you ask?  I know this because that's when I was going to sleep - or at least I thought I was.  At about 11:30, while falling deep into peaceful slumber, I was violently and rudely awakened by screaming police sirens and screeching tires.  Now, I'm used to sirens in the middle of the night - after all, it is Downtown - but not at this high volume.   After my heart began to beat again, I got up and went out onto my terrace to see what all the commotion was.  It was Fast and Furious 2.  They had closed of the entire 4 blocks of the street one block over for this scene, which apparently involves a high speed police chase outside a strip club.    Also, apparently, they didn't get it right the first time and had to re-shoot the scene around 2am - sirens and tires and all.   So, when you go see this movie (sometime next year probably) and you get to the scene outside a really colorful strip club with a green entrance, know that you're in my 'hood.  And when you hear the screaming sirens and the screeching tires, remember your Diva being ripped from her slumber at 2am when they shot that damn thing!  Ah, the glamourous life.   Diva out.

      Monday again.  But not at all a bad day.  Spent my allotted blog-update time working on someone else's blog.  Check out  urlLink Gerbilman Rant  and I'm sure you'll notice my little touches here and there.  Even with a gay man, there's nothing like a woman's touch. *grin*  5pm has come all too soon (sound familiar ladies?)... sorry, I've gotten off track.  What I meant to say it that it's after 5pm now and I have to head out to my other full time job of motherhood.  Diva out.

       Hands on Miami Day  I sometimes volunteer with an organization called  urlLink Hands On Miami .  As the brochure says, "In partnership with United Way of Miami-Dade, Hands On Miami is a non-profit organization that leads 75 group volunteer projects each month including providing companionship to the elderly, reading bedtime stories to homeless children, and restoring the environment".  Saturday, November 2 is "Hands On Miami Day" and I will be part of a large group of volunteers doing random acts of kindness as organized by H.O.M.  This is their largest fund-raising effort every year, and I need your help.    You may have noticed that little "Donate" button at the top of my screen - near my counter.  If you haven't already seen it, I'm sure you're looking at it now.   This fabulous little button can make you a part of Hands On Miami Day without ever having to do any of the dirty work.  By clicking on that button, you will be walked through a process of donating money directly to me as my sponsor.    And if you want a reciept for being my sponsor I will be more than happy to send you one.  I need to collect this money and turn it in on the day of the event, November 2nd.  If you're not comfortable using your credit card over the internet, let me know and I can give you my mailing address - you can even make the check out to Hands On Miami if that will make you feel better.   I hope you will consider being a sponsor for me - I beleive that its really important to try and improve the world around you.  It's like that bumper sticker says -- think globally, act locally.  I'm acting, and I hope you will sponsor and support my action.  If you want to join me for this event, let me know and I'm sure something can be arranged!  Diva out.

       Mysterious Stranger  I was ruminating on the latest developments of my blog and its new e-mail address last night.  I was hoping the Birth Control? was a miscellaneous stranger who had been drawn in by my blog content (see the tag board over there for reference).  Then it hit me... I have drawn in at least one random reader!  I feel so accomplished - of course I had to steal her content to get her attention, but hey, whatever works.  And actually, this has lead me to Blogs by Women.  You know me, I'm all about girl power; so of course I've joined the web ring.  It sounds so mysterious and elite, doesn't it?  Web ring... I'm picturing women dancing around in circles in the forest worshipping their goddess Bonni the web ring leader.  I feel so dark and mysterious.  LOL  - no longer just one divine diva, but one of many!  So, thanks for the connection Eliz.  Diva out.

      Ok, so I've added Life on the Ridge to my list of faves.  Gerbilman Rant is about to be removed, since he hasn't updated that thing in a-g-e-s.  Must be all the slow-paced country living... nothing to rant about.  Must be nice.   And if anybody has the link to Laughing Boy I would really like to visit him again.

       My Soapbox  One of the benefits of a blog is that you can speak your mind and blather on for hours and hours about whatever it is that you think is ruining the world at large.  And I feel a little blathering coming on...  I have, of late, noticed in the course of conversations when the speaker categorizes other people, or themselves for that matter.  I.E. - "We "colors" are like that."  I swear a man actually said that to me; granted he was from an older generation that grew up in segregation.  Sadly he apparently still lives in that world.    But I had it yesterday from someone closer to my own age group; and he had a box for every race you can think of.  The jews this, the argentinians that; even "we puerto ricans...".  Maybe its just me in my own little utopian mind, but I try to not categorize people based on color, religion or nationality - or anything else for that matter.  In my world, people are people.    And that's something I love about the internet and the blogs you can find on Blogger.  There are no color lines, no country boundaries, no geographical limits.  The internet highway transcends the physical limits we experience in our every day lives.  Yes, you can find a lot of hate and ugliness (like that  Shudder  e-mail I recieved today - man was that ugly!).  But generally, when you look at a blog, you don't necessarily see the color of the author or the sexual preference or the nationality or even what country they live in.  You see the blog and the ideas and life experiences expressed.  You are given information to determine how you feel about the person writing.  Just something to think about next time you start to shove someone into a categorical box.  People aren't buttons and tacks to be placed in boxes with labels - if they were you could be sure Martha Stewart would be selling the boxes AND the labels for neat little packaging.   I will not be packaged.    *now quietly and humbly stepping down from my soap box* Diva out.

      I got an e-mail the other day with re: blog in the subject line.  I don't know if it was spam or a real message regarding my divine and divalicious web log.  So, I have created a very special e-mail address just for my blog.  Now, when you click on "Show me love" (or whatever clever little ditty I put down there) for sending me a message, it will magically be sent to my new e-mail address.  Ok, ok, I know you're just dying to know the address - downtowndiva9@hotmail.com.  I love e-mail.  Diva out.

       Gotta love South Beach  Everyone who knows me, knows I work on South Beach.  I used to live on South Beach, but there's some law here that you can only live here if you're willing to piss your life away in a night club taking large amounts of alcohol and ecstasy.  Soooo, I had to leave.  But I am allowed to work here.  And my hotel receives this glamorous, shiny magazine called Lincoln Road.  It's all about the businesses, restaurants, clubs and people on and around Lincoln Road - a glorified strip mall here on the beach.  It's full of pretty people doing fabulous things - dancing, drinking, eating and loving life.  And this month, one of the hot articles listed on the cover is touted as follows:     Club Lust  The urge to merge and sex between patrons   And the highlighted quote from the article: "I've walked into DJ booths above the dance floors and seen girls under the control panels making the DJ's happy." Manny Hernandez, Photographer  Gotta love South Beach - either love it or leave it, as they say.  *grin*  Diva out.

       Monday blues   But, actually I'm not really very blue.  Feeling pretty good today.  Spending time with Leia yesterday may have something to do with it.   She is such a trip these days; she's only 3 but she speaks so clearly and expresses herself so well.   And she'll say hello to just about anyone, as long as mommy is close by.    Hmm, wonder if that would work to pick up men; guys use the baby decoy thing to pick up women, but I somehow don't think it works the same with men.  Although, I did have a man chat me up at the gas station; Leia wanted to drive and he said, "Let her drive.  She can't be any worse than the old people around here."  And then he smiled at me.  Hmmm....   Anyway, our new thing at home is to NOT say "Hey!" because "Hey" is for horses, according to Leia.  So I say it just to make her crazy.   Once when she was acting more like a wild animal than a girl I said, "Hey, cut it out!"   Leia replied, "Hay is for horses" and I said, "Yeah, well, you're acting more like a horse than a girl, so I can say "Hay!".  She had no reply other than to weakly repeat herself, "Hey is for horses, mommy."  Now, everytime I say "Hey" to someone, as in "Hello" I automatically think of Leia's reprimand.   Ah, the things we learn from our children.  Diva out.

      Surfing again brought me to  urlLink Life on the Ridge .  Just had to share this entry - hope she doesn't mind...  Wednesday, October 02, 2002    little boy blue  I have a horrible tendancy to lecture. This morning I lectured Michael on how important it is to pick up his trains (Toby likes to chew on them). I must have been extraordinarily long-winded.  Michael looked up at me and very seriously said, "Shut your pie-hole, Mom, bitte!"  He spent three minutes on the boring time-out bench and then had to pick up his trains. I put them out of his reach.  No child of mine will get away with being disrespectful to an adult!  Now shut YOUR pie-hole. Your giggling is plucking my last nerve.

       And the birthday countdown has begun  So, 59 days till my birthday and I just booked myself into the fabulous  urlLink  Mandarin Oriental Hotel & Spa   overlooking Biscayne Bay.  Ah, luxury king room, spa amenities and a full day at their pampering spa.   Now if I could just secure a special guy to share this fabulousness with. *sigh*  Or maybe I'll just invite about six of my closest friends and we'll have a sleep over - a la those Ft. Lauderdale days!  hmmm, now that's an idea! :)  Diva out.

Check her out in all her fabulousness!  But be careful,  urlLink she may provoke you!   On another note, Autumn is here in Miami.  The air is a little crisp and sweet smelling, the ocean is the perfect temperature for swimming now, and the wind is picking up.  I love this part of the year in Miami.    And only 60 days to my birthday ;)  Diva out.

November 26: Tina Turner - the most vivacious and completely alive woman there ever was November 27: Jimi Hendrix - one of the most powerfully creative and vibrant souls to show up as a mortal November 29: Garry Shandling - this must be why I get his jokes  November 30: Ben Stiller - yet another great creative mind - and again, I get his jokes December 01: Bette Midler - The Divine Ms. M - she knew early on that she is a Diva! December 02: Britney Spears - Diva in training - and no matter how much you try not to like her, you do.  Diva out... for now.

       Ugh, haircut  Everytime I get my hair cut, I'm reminded of why I don't get my hair cut very often.  I'm talking like once every 7 or 8 months.  I can't take the added stress and grief any more often than that.  So, I took the plunge and went to the salon yesterday.  I know that as a reigning Diva, I should practically LIVE in the salon. But I don't.  Because not only am I a Diva, but I am also a single mom, and let's face it -- kids are expensive!  But, being that my  BIRTHDAY IS ON SATURDAY  I decided to pamper myself.  That and the fact that my hair was strangely reminiscent of cousin It.    Nothing drastic, no major chopping was done.  But, why is it that as soon as I get home I realize that I liked my hair the way it was.  I ultimately decide that I don't like what was done and that I could have done a much better job with hedge clippers and saved myself the 50 bucks I just spent.  Then, I almost always grab my scissors and destroy what I just spent 50 bucks on.  I try to resist the urge, but it is overwhelming and I almost always give in to just a few little snips here and there.  And then, finally, I come to the realization that in a few weeks it will grow back and I will be just fine.  *ugh*  BTW, did I mention that my  BIRTHDAY IS ON SATURDAY ?  Diva out.

       I've lost it  Well, I was going to tell you all about my escapade in the men's bathroom Friday night, but I guess that will have to wait.  *she said teasingly as she quickly changed the subject*   Last night I lost it.  I may have totally blown my chance for "Mom of the Year" Award after last night's scene.  I have a cold right now.  My two wonderful and loving daughters were sick a few weeks ago - I missed a few days of work to care for them - and now its my turn to be sick.   Of course, I would never miss work to take care of myself. So, I worked yesterday while nursing a full blown cold, then went home to cook dinner, empty the dishwasher, load the dishwasher, give the little one a bath, entertain my now very healthy children and then get them settled into sleep mode.  With a full blown cold.  After rocking the little one to sleep for 35 minutes, I laid her in her cute little toddler bed.  That's when she looked at up me and said she wanted her "sippy cup" -  warm milk from a cup to help her fall asleep - when she was already asleep before I laid her down.  At first I thought to resist because I was sick and tired and sooooo ready for sleep.  But I knew that would only prolong my misery, so instead I wigged out.  "Fine! Let's get a sippy cup!" I bellowed at the top of my hoarse and scratchy voice.  I stormed out of the bedroom, leaving the little one stunned in her bed, and tromped into the kitchen.  Tore open the fridge, banged the sippy cup on the counter - it was a full-fledged tantrum.  I calmed down when Kala walked in to see what was wrong with me.    I felt like a three year old without a mommy, but then Kala gave me a little hug and I apologized for being such a brat.  I told her that I'm sick and want my mommy to take care of me!  She thought that was kind of funny, but then tried to find ways to sympathize with me.  Didn't make me feel better, but I knew that she was trying.    After my explosion, all was quiet again.  I apologized to Leia and Kala for freaking out, then rocked Leia back to sleep while Kala chatted frantically about her friends until she fell asleep on the sofa.  Then I went to bed and slept like a baby - with a full blown cold.  Diva out.

       Happy Monday?  Well, here we are again.  Another Monday... and I have a few things to talk about - I realize that I now look for material for my blog.  Sad, I know.  But, hey, gotta get my kicks somehow. ;)  So, today I have the "Diva is a hottie" story.  Yes, yes, we have already established that I am a "foxy" diva.  If you need proof, check the archives for that little obscure test I "borrowed" from  urlLink Life on the Ridge .  However, I was told a very funny story the other night that I just had to share.  As told by Marvin, I was the center of a scene one day on the street.  Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, I was unaware of the whole thing.  Marvin says he saw me walking around a corner in my fabulous diva-like way (my embellishment - Marvin thought it but didn't actually say it), and when I passed a man was apparently taken by my divaness.  So he thinks out loud to the crowd at the bus stop "What a hottie!" and begins to skulk behind me making vulgar movements while following closely behind in a "ooooh baby"-like fashion.  The crowd laughed at him because I was obviously ignoring him.  I ignored him when he walked face first into a pole making a very loud "clunk" sound with his face.  Marvin says the whole thing was hysterical.  I'm sure it was... I just wish I had been there to see it!  See, I have a tendency to walk with my head up, looking straight ahead, staying very focused on where and how I step.  Because, while my closest friends know that I am the epitomy of style and grace - think Audrey Hepburn... shut up Dee! -- I do tend to be a little...um shall we say, clumsy?  Ok.  I have be known to trip over my own two feet while standing still and a tree has fallen on my head.  So, while this lovely *ahem* gentleman was ogling me in public, I was making sure I didn't fall on my face while stepping lightly over the cracks in the sidewalk!  Just another day in Diva-ville.   Diva out.

       Oh, What a night!  Late September, back in 63,.... oh, sorry.  Got a little carried away there.  My mind is sort of wandering aimlessly this morning... must have something to do with too little sleep.  The Wine Club last night was absolutely amazing.  We had about 55 attendees, most of whom were new faces - and very nice looking faces at that.  So many of the "right" people were here last night, and everyone one of them had a fabulous time.  The final count of empty wine bottles was 47 I think.  Almost a bottle of wine per person, with a never-ending stream of hors d'ouevres.  I buzzed through the crowd all evening long,  meeting new people and saying hello to familiar favorites.    I met a man who bid $2500 on an auction item to take a Wine Tour through Napa Valley - 8 days of nothing but wine and gourmet 5-course dinners each day.  I met a very attractive young man who owns a cigar company - he wants to host cigar & cognac events here.  Let's see, there was the realtor guy who has started attending regularly, sitting with 5 new female friends in the corner; my dear friend who has supported the club from its inception - his wide, soulful eyes alway focus on the crowd as he studies the evening's faces and actions.  Then there's the greek bath house manager who is a party in skin - he's such a wonderfully enthusiastic man, full of joie de vive.  A very rowdy bunch of women drew in our newest Wine Club regular into their little group of raucous fun for the rest of the evening.  And I met the organizer for the International Wine Fair - of which I hope to be a part... the event, not the man.  Although... ;)  All in all, it was a wonderful ending to a pretty good day.  Now I think I'll go get another cup of coffee.  Diva out.

       I am blessed  Most of us just gripe when things go wrong.  Today, I'm giving thanks for the things that go right.  As a sagittarius, I know that I am the luckiest sign in the zodiac.  I also know that as an optimist, I always see the bright side of everything.  It helps avoid wrinkle lines by not worrying so much.  Today, I was concerned about my gas tank.  I've made a habit out of running on empty lately, and I'm close to that now.  I have to haul my cookies over to Hialeah this evening to drop off the girls at Grandma's house.  I have to then fly back over to the beach to host The Wine Club event at 7:30p.  2 hours sounds like a lot of time, but when you're travelling in Miami during rush hour traffic, its almost not enough time.  So, I'm thinking, "Who am I going to borrow 10 bucks from?" when I am reminded that I'm doing a notary gig this morning at the hotel next door.  Yes, folks, along with all of my other fabulous abilities, I am a notary.  Closest to politician as I'll ever get.  So, I head over realizing that I'm getting $10 for this.  Exactly what I was hoping to borrow for gas later today.  And, after stamping a few pages for some very good looking, wealthy company Presidents sitting inside a very posh and fabulous hotel cabana room, I'm handed $40 and sent about my merry way.  I left there feeling very blessed indeed.  I'm am constantly reminded that you will get what you ask for, if you ask nicely.  The universe is my provider and I am so grateful for all that I have.  The $40 was just another reminder that what I need comes to me when I need it, and it reminded me of just how fortunate I am.   Feeling very fulfilled today.  Diva out.

      Ok. first of all, I am very certain that the little blog roll thing down on the right is just not working.  The little "blogs that like me" is causing me undue grief; here I am thinking nobody likes me *diva pouting pitifully*.  now i've come to the conclusion that the damn thing must not be working, because I personally crept into  urlLink Fred's blog  and put in a reference to myself and that little counter thing didn't catch it.  So, I'm taking off the page until I can figure out how to get it to work.  I will not be ignored!  And apparently the bug died, because my friend is doing a little better today.

       Sombody's got a bug up her ass today!   As an administrative diva, I live to serve.  I know that some people don't want to do certain mundane things themselves so they get me to do them.  I do it all, its my job.  And I usually do it with a smile.  Today, however, someone apparently has a problem with me.  Maybe she had too much (or not enough) alcohol and/or prescribed drugs last night.  I don't know, but she's in a mood.    First of all, she strolls into the office at 1pm - later than her usual 11am ETA.  Then, she flips out because the contract she promised to someone yesterday is in her mailbox for proofing.  She could have turned a few degrees to her right and faxed the contract to her client without incident.  Instead, she climbed the two flights of stairs and crossed the hall to my desk, where she threw the contract onto my desk for me to fax.    A terse voicemail about another client (which I had already handled) and a phone call to me about an e-mail she never received - while the rest of our staff managed to get it - and the day is only just beginning.  I have to remember that work is my blessing.  I may just laugh at her next attempt to make me as miserable as she is today.  Diva out.

       Not impressed  It's cold today.  62 degrees here on the beach, and 57 whereever it is that my little weather tramp over there lives.  The airport I guess.  And she's not even wearing a sweater.  I guess when you're that hot, you don't need wool.    Anyway, this is NOT why I live in Miami.  57 degrees is in no way tropical.  I know so many northern transplants here in Miami are overjoyed at the drop in temperature.  It's crisp and lively and the air is fresh.  Whatever.    All I know is I'm looking forward to warmer weather again.  If I wanted cold, I'd have chosen to live somewhere north.  Give me a good, muggy August afternoon at 95 degrees and let me live happily in Miami.  This cold crap is for the (snow)birds!  Diva out.

       Happy Friday!   It is a happy Friday here in paradise.  At least that's what I'm going to keep telling myself until I believe it.  However, upon learning some very important news this morning I have reached the decision that some things have got to change.  And it will take more than a little hair color to fix.  I have to give up ice cream. *gasp!*  I know.  I know. Its a very drastic step.  My mind is screaming like a defiant two year old, "No! I won't do it."  But I must.  That and I will continue further along the path toward a vegetarian diet.   I know, its almost more than I can cope with.  But, apparently, while I was focusing on my emotional and spiritual well-being with yoga, meditation, books and the like, I forgot about my physical health.  Now my cholesterol is at 230 (200 is safe) and triglycerides are at... Dave, a drumroll please... 300. (100 is safe!)  And what with my paranoia regarding heart disease, I need to get back on track with a healthy diet and a little more cardio-related exercise.    Anybody know any yummy tasting, rich and creamy, Ben-and-Jerry's-ish fat-free, cholesterol-free ice cream?  Fat chance!    Diva out.

       Didn't fall out of my tree!  Fred wondered if I had fallen out of my tree.  No, but I was out of the office for several days.  The littlest pinecone (Leia) has been sick since last Thursday.  Fever from 100 to 102 for about 5 days straight with a cough.  Her usual wonderful doctor, Dr. Leitner "the nice lady doctor" wasn't in on the day I took Leia into the office.  The doctor who did see her couldn't find anything wrong with her, except a slight fever and a little chest congestion.   Duh.  No medicine prescribed, and I usually prefer to avoid antibiotics and such when they aren't needed.  However, in the meantime, I've missed about 3 days of work.    And just when I was beginning to wonder what damage a prolonged fever could do to a 3 year old brain, Leia started getting better.  She is in school today and feeling better somehow.  I'm back in the office, buried under a pile of work and endless voicemails asking if I've done this thing or that, where's that thing or the other.  My answer is the same.  I haven't really been here since last Thursday, so I haven't done it and I don't know where it is!  Diva out.

       Gardening 101  I spoke to my mom today.  I'm sure she thinks I'm strange.  I asked her to send me a pinecone.    There a little hard to come by in Downtown Miami, and I asked her to send me one.  "Why?" you ask. *while thinking I'm a little strange, too*  I've been reading a great book called "Teachings of Love" by this amazing Vietnamese Buddhist Monk *my strangeness reveals itself*.  In one chapter, he discusses how we are a part of our family and our family is a part of us.  Sometimes, when we stand apart from our family (especially here in the West), we can become confused.  We can suffer like a tree that has become uprooted when we sever the roots of our family.    And that's me in a nutshell.  Family has been a collection of people that had very little to do with who I am and what I am.  Then I realized that's not true.  While I'm not a branch or a flower on the tree, I am still part of that family tree.  I'm a pinecone.  I've left the tree, but its still in me, made me who I am, and I am still part of the tree.  I'm a pinecone, taking the nature of that family with me, and growing my own roots somewhere else.  Continuing my family with a family of my own.  So today, I asked my mom to send me a pinecone as a reminder of who I am.  I tried explaining it to her.  I'm sure she thinks I'm strange.  And I can only guess what fodder I've provided for Fred Gerbilman.  But at the risk of sounding strange, I'll end by saying "Spiritual lesson over for today, grasshopper."

       Having a fussy day.  Not only did I just add  urlLink Fussy  to my blogroll.  As I was surfing using that beloved NextBlog button, I came across  urlLink Icrywolf  and what do find but the same picture of a cat with a clown painted on its butt... taken from Fussy.

       Wasted Talent  My kids don't always get my jokes.  Granted, I don't think of really funny stuff all the time, but when I do my kids just don't get it.  Leia brought home a book from the daycare on Friday, a "math for kids" book.  It's titled "Give me Half".  I saw the title and told Leia, "Yeah, you'll need to know that for a little later in life, honey."  I giggled to myself at how clever I was.  Nobody else got it. *sigh*  Diva out.

       And the Diva is so IN!  Just when I was starting to envy Gerbilman and his rapidly growing audience... Candy Genius lists the Diva as a "Sweet Blog".  Is that cool or what?  I could have been there for days, I just never thought to check the list.  I feel like one of the cool kids now.    And she has this nifty little list at the bottom of her page that lists where her blog has been referenced. That is sooooo cool.  Wish I could do that.

       Old Reliable  Every morning as I drive over the causeway, I see this man running.  He's not running away from anything, he's just running.  And not just on sunny mornings; in rain and cold he's out there.  I've seen him as early as 8:10am, and as late as 10:15am.  So, he jogs back and forth over the two causeway bridges for at least 2 hours every day.  And I can't help but wonder why.  I feel like stopping my car, getting out on the side of the road and asking him.  What motivates him to do this?  Why could jogging possibly be so important to him?  He gets out of his bed very early every morning and devotes several hours of his precious time to this task.  As much as I love running, I'm lucky if I get a good 4 miles of running in once a month. He does this EVERY DAY.  I'm just amazed at how some people can be so dedicated to their principles.  So steadfast and reliable in their everyday routines.     I'm sure I'll have more to say today - I'm feeling very chatty.  So, Diva out... for now.

       Stunned and Amazed  What kind of sub-human robs a  church?   I hope they find out, because someone broke into the church where my youngest goes to daycare.  Imagine my uncertainty when pulling into the driveway as I counted 4 news vans and a crime scene unit parked in front of the church.  I've seen news trucks there before.  When the Elian thing happened, the nun who was helping him was holed up in a mansion across the street to hide from the media and the protestors.  All of that in front of the church and daycare that had no connection to any of it.  I had to take my daughter out early that day for safety.  So today I was wondering what could have happened, and would Leia be safe.    Turns out some creep broke in to the church, the church office and the daycare office looking for -- ?? Money?? The thief apparently didn't find the cash stored away in the daycare office, because its still there.  The pastor's car was taken however.     It's just shameful.  I'm sorry for the pastor and the violation she must be feeling.  I know it sucks to have someone come in and touch your stuff, let alone  take  your stuff.  But I also feel sorrow for the thief.  How low do you have to be to break into God's house?  Even if its not your religion,  it's God's house!   And I wonder if the thief figured the pastor wouldn't press charges if caught - you know, forgiveness and all that.  HAH!  Even Jesus displayed "righteous indignation".    Just a sad thing to see first thing in the morning.  Diva out.

        urlLink Gay Sheep    I'm not sure if I find this helpful or not.   This is my favorite part of the  urlLink article...   "First the scientists watched the sheep to be sure of their behavior  something that cannot be done with humans. Then they took apart their brains."    You can't watch human behavior, but you can take apart their brains.  Why does that not sound right to me?  Diva out.

         I'm back.   I'm not dead, although chocolate is always welcomed.    Just been super busy, which of course means I've been super happy.  As mentioned, Wednesday's Wine Club event was fabulous.  Halloween trick or treating was a blast.  Went door to door in a quiet little neighborhood and the girls got lots and lots of treats.  Friday I was supposed to go to a party, but I just didn't have the strength to make the 60 mile drive.    Saturday was Hands On Miami Day; I was assigned to painting a mural in a Salvation Army homeless shelter.  I must say that I was very impressed with the comfort and cleanliness of the shelter - it was more like a nursing home, but with mothers and children.  Made me feel good just knowing that these children - very much like my own - were safe with a roof over their heads.  Just gave me the warm & fuzzies --  no smart ass comments, Joe!   Saturday night was the Bug Ball, where my Wine Club sponsored the wine for the party.  Very nice collection of socialites and party-goers together for the good of the garden.    Sunday I stayed in bed till noon - I just didn't have the energy to get up until then.  Monday was catch up time in the office, and I'm finally back on track and on-line.  So, no Joe.  I'm not dead, but you can send chocolates if you want!  Diva out.

       Last complaint this year!  I promise after this, I won't complain for the rest of the year ;)  It hasn't really rained in weeks, and my blue car was the color dirt.  So I spent 30 minutes and 3 dollars on a car wash last night.  There's a 70% chance of rain today. Figures.  And, why is it, that no matter how many times you explain something to someone; tell them, put it in written memo as a standard procedure, ask them, beg them... it just never gets done right.  Arrgh!  Considering it was concering reservations for New Year's Eve, and I no longer (nor ever did) have a handle on it all, it would now be moot to complain.  So I don't even get to growl at anyone to fix it, because its just about over for another year.  Growl, growl.  Diva out.

       Old Dog?  Still learning new tricks... tried roller blading for the first time yesterday.  Little sister sent me a pair for christmas.  And much to my surprise, and to the chagrin of the lookers-on, I did not fall down.  Went around the block three times with Leia at my side, riding her bike.  Didn't fall once.  Nice to know that I'm not too old to learn new things.  Diva out.

       Something to Ponder  From  urlLink Friday Five :  1. What was your biggest accomplishment this year? Toss up between getting into my own apartment in January and getting child support.  2. What was your biggest disappointment? DBD losing his job after only 3 months, thereby losing my child support.  3. Will you be making any New Year's resolutions?  Yes - to create stronger bonds with the people I know & love.  4. Where will you be at midnight? Do you wish you could be somewhere else?  Working at my hotel, standing on Miami Beach watching fireworks with glass of champagne in hand - and I get paid to do this!  5. Aside from (possibly) staying up late, do you have any other New Year's traditions?  I just believe that whatever you are doing on NYE sets the theme for the new year.  And for my own thoughts, not ones borrowed from  urlLink Eliz     Things I've learned this year.  1. How to get the child support & judicial system to work without the aid (?) of a lawyer. 2. That I could very easily become the same kind of parent that my parents were - egad!  3. How to be mindful of what I say and do and how to think/speak only loving things. 4. That people who move away do not necessarily leave me behind. 5. I have abandonment issues. 6. 2002 was difficult and I still managed to keep my head up and smile through it all. 7. Yoga is life.  I believe that every day is a lesson to be learned and each year is just another opportunity to create more love and joy in our lives.  So, what did 2002 teach you?  Diva out.

       Sigh of relief  Well, thank god that's over!  Christmas Day is history.  Surprisingly, it was a great day... the best that I can remember.  I always had this idea of what I would like Christmas to be, but every year the day left me disappointed.  This one left me feeling satisfied instead.  We went to two Christmas Eve dinners, one Cuban and one Mexican - both with pork.  Very yummy and lots of fun with friends, old and new.  My girls are growing into true party girls - we were out until 2am and they managed to be in good moods the whole time.   On Christmas morning, they were up at 7:30am so I was up at 7:31am.  Didn't get to bed until 3am.  Ouch.  But there were so many gifts under the bamboo tree for them (thanks to my parents, my brother, my sister & her husband), and even a few for me!  I got some of the best gifts ever - including a beautiful pair of opera glasses (I've been wanting a pair for a few years now), a digital camera and Oscar de la Renta perfume & cream (Thanks Tony!).  And we spent Christmas Day with my family in Palm Beach. Grandma, aunts, uncles, cousins all from my mother's side of the family.  Even though they only live 2 counties away, I never see them.  Its a stange thing about Dade County.  People who don't live here rarely come here.  People who do live here rarely leave.    But it was a great day for sure.  Family, turkey, presents and carols and more desserts than we could possibly finish in one day.    I hope that your day was just as nice ~ that no matter what you did, you enjoyed it completely.

       Fa-la-la-la-la  Christmas cards are out, cookies are all hand-delivered at work.  Even the little books of quotes are delivered.  I've been a busy little diva!  Also, I took my girls to Brunch with Santa on Saturday - a very nice gift from one of my co-workers.  Actually, Saturday was Holiday Day in my little family of girls.  After Santa, we went to the mall with money from Mom and bought the girls each a new outfit.  Crowds were bad, but not unpleasant.  And the sales were good.  Even got to see a special holiday show in cirque du soleil style.    After being "malled", we went to a Holiday-themed carnival here in Downtown Miami, replete with glowing palm trees and neon Magic City Miami sign!  There was a traditional holiday village with Santa and his reindeer and the little snow-painted houses, along with lots of rides and stuff, with holiday music in the background.  They even had an ice-skating rink (fake of course) along Biscayne Bay.  With the boat parade and full moon over the Bay behind, it made for quite a memorable evening.  I do love Miami, and I'm in the holiday mood, in spite of myself.  Diva out.

       Bah Humbug  I'm one of those people who waits until Christmas Eve to do all their shopping.  I do love the rush of a deadline, and of course I usually don't have any cash to spend until the payday before Christmas anyway.    Here in our little slice of paradise, where I work, we get paid on every other Thursday.  I was thinking that since the Holiday was on Wednesday we would get paid on Tuesday.  Then, I was informed that payroll was being done one day early - so I figure that was to allow for payday on Tuesday.  Wrong!  Apparently, while I thought I was working for a nice person, I am in actuality working for Mr. Ebeneezer Scrooge.  Payday will be on Thursday, as usual.  The day AFTER Christmas. *sigh*  So, to date I have bought exactly one Clifford wristwatch and I have "acquired" a Vanessa Carlton CD.  And with my mother-in-law and her entire family (including DBD) in New Jersey supporting the family after the tragedy, there isn't much of a Christmas to look forward to.  Thankfully,  my mom & sister have played Santa this year and sent me SEVERAL boxes of gifts for the girls (and even a little something or two for me) So it won't be a total dissappointment (I hope).  Chin up, chest out, faking a cheerful holiday smile.  Diva out.

       Better today  Feeling relief today, for no real reason other than I am just grateful.  For every little thing that bothered me yesterday my inner voice reminded me that at least I didn't start the day by dying.  *and don't worry, I don't have little voices in my head, Fred*  I just kept reminding myself of how fortunate I am in everything.  And I was reminded that, even though I do have serious money problems which I expect to become more serious in the next few months - thanks to the unemployed DBD - sometimes money doesn't matter.  There are other problems in life.  I kissed and hugged my girls more than usual yesterday evening.   Stood outside on the balcony, 25 floors above Miami last night.  Stared out at the twinkling stars that are the city lights below me and silently gave thanks for all that I have.  Diva out.

       Grumble Grumble  1. My left bra strap keeps falling and is driving me crazy! 2. I officially hate all copiers and printers in my office.  If one of them would work properly for more than a day, I would be overjoyed. 3. I have gone way over my chocolate quota for the week, all this morning.  I feel like I could explode at any moment from chocolate overload.

       On a more positive note  What I wanted to write about this morning, before the tragic news...  If anyone had ever told me that one day I would bake 24 miniature pumpkin pies, and then lovingly wrap each one first in cellophane and then in paper tied with a ribbon, I'd think they'd lost their mind.  Now, I think I have.  Because that's what I was up doing until 11pm last night.  Painstakingly and lovingly done as gifts for everyone that has become special to me this year.  Sunday I baked 6 dozen cookies, tonight I'll bake another 10.  And then lovingly wrap each one first in cellophane and then in paper tied with a ribbon.  I never knew I had it in me.  Damn, am I a catch or what?  All fabulous Diva-ness AND I can bake!  Diva out.

       Just tragic   I've read all the Dostoevsky novels, those sad and dark tales where people die from chest colds and madness.  That was way back when people used coal for heat in their homes, and travelled by horse-drawn buggy.  This is 2002, almost 2003.  Things like that just don't happen anymore.  At least that's what I thought until now.    I received a phone call this morning on the way to work.  That was my first indication that something was wrong - my cell never rings in the morning.  It was my mother-in-law, who only calls in the morning  to be the first to wish her granddaughters a happy birthday.  Today was not a birthday.  Bad news was her reason for calling today.  As I listened, she explained that her brother called her today, first thing in the morning.  She had the same thought - he never calls that early in the morning, not even for birthdays.  Bad news was his reason for calling.  Their 20 year old daughter had caught a cold a few days ago, and was feeling having trouble breathing last night due to the congestion.  She went to sleep last night, woke up this morning unable to breath.  The ambulance was called and she was taken to the hospital, but sometime this morning she died.    Unbelievable, incredulous, impossible news.  I don't understand how this can happen.  I was dumbstruck and griefstricken all at the same time.  I wasn't very close to her, but she is my mother-in-law's niece, and very loved in our family.  This isn't some Dostoevsky novel, this is our life.  Death has touched our family and I don't know what to do about it.  I want to console my mother-in-law in her loss but I don't even know where to begin.  Before she hung up with me she asked me to take very good care of her girls (my daughters).  I told her of course I would.    I may have more thoughts on this later today, but I feel like just putting this into my blog may help relieve some of the sadness in my heart somehow.  And of course, as I always dwell on things in a philosophical manner, I am sure I will have more to say on this later.    Once the shock has worn off.  Diva out.

       Almost perfect   The Diva had a date.  I know, you're thinking, "Of course she did.  As fab as she is, she must go out on dates all the time."  Yeah, whatever.  Anyway, I was invited to a holiday party on Saturday night, and I have to say it was one of the best dates I have been on in years, perhaps ever.  We went to a company holiday party, where I sat at a boring table with extended warantee salesmen and a very spoiled wife.  Listened to a speech about how great the "team" is doing, yadda yadda.  The most interesting part was when I met a guy who went to my high school and graduated 11 years before me.    But I got to dance to one of my most favorite slow songs ever, "Lady in Red" - I just love that song and I've never had the opportunity to dance to it (with another person that is).  And my friend was funny and charming and such a gentleman.  Helped me with my coat, made sure I was comfortable, offered to get me drinks from the bar.  Just the perfect date.  Then, he took me to a Wine Bar, owned by a friend of his.  Now, not only am I a diva, but my alter ego is a wine diva!  So, I was in heaven!  They had a wine list to die for!  After drooling over the list, I selected a glass of a French Chardonnay called Fat Bastard.  I couldn't resist the name!  It was really very good.    We sat outside, in very chilly weather, and kept cozy next to a wood burning stove and talked for a long time.  It was such a great evening, and he thanked me for making his night so special.  Sounds great, right?  Well, as this entry's title implies, it was almost perfect.  Unfortunately, I don't see this friend in a romantic light.  He's very nice, attractive, tall, etc.  But, no chemistry.  Damn, imagine that wood burning stove with a little chemistry.  *sigh*  But, most importantly I was on a date instead of home alone.  And it was a great evening.  Diva out.

       Checked my  urlLink 'scope  this morning  Sometimes these things are just so dead on its scary.    "With the sun in your sign, your wish is like a command to the universe but you know what they say about being careful with wishes. Add to that, your imagination is either a source of incredible strength or weakness right now. You could just about manifest anything from a mere thought but before you become the proud new owner of a passing thought, make sure its what you really, really want. Take some time out this morning to imagine that you have your most heartfelt desire. Then what would you do? Remember that half the fun of getting something new is in the hunt, whether its for a job, a love or a new pair of shoes."  God god, I'm looking for two out of three of those RIGHT NOW (never you mind which two).  And, whether you believe it or not, I already know about making my desires manifest.  I realize that I have an uncanny ability to make myself the "owner of a passing thought" and have done so on many occasions.  Actually, we all have that ability - we just don't all develop and use it to its fullest potential.  Here's a test - next time your driving in an unfamiliar area, tell yourself you really really want a 7-11, or a Burger King - whatever.  But really really want to see one.  Want to see it because you're testing the universe and your own ability to tap into it.  See if you get what you want.  Freaks me out whenever I try it!  So, just a reminder to always be careful what you wish for.  Like I said before, the universe can have a very twisted sense of humor.  Diva out.

       One more thing...  In cleaning up my blog list I am very sad in reporting that I have taken "hmmm" off the list.  Dee has not updated her blog in a very very long time and I just can see sending people to a blog that gets no love.    And, I thought about taking off "Juan is a loser", but I somehow find comfort in knowing that he hasn't updated his blog in a very very long time.  Following the story, I would hope that he has gotten over what's-her-name.  Ok, so it's actually three things... cause I want to suggest checking out mimi smartypants if you haven't already.  She is very entertaining, in an ambivalent sort of way.  Diva out.

       How many days left?!  I'm not even going to get into the shopping days that are left.  I never shop for Christmas until the 24th anyway.  The holiday spirit just doesn't descend upon me until then.  But it is beginning to look a lot like Christmas around here.  We're making holiday cards this year - an old-fashioned Christmas; and we're baking all of our gifts.  Mini pumpkin pies, sugar drop cookies, pumpkin bread and the best chocolate chip cookies I've ever tasted.  And they ship well, too.  Last night we decided (we being my two children) that it was time to decorate the tree.  Only problem is that we don't have a tree.  Got lost in all the moving over the past 3 years, I guess.  So, I suggested we decorate the bamboo tree on the terrace.  They loved it!  And after we were finished with the tree (we being mostly me this time), it looked pretty good.  Why shouldn't you have a bamboo tree for Christmas in Miami?  We are the epitomy of tropical chic. *grin*  And, if it had been 40 degrees colder last night, it would have snowed.  At 74 degrees, what we got was rain.  Truly a tropical Miami Christmas *sigh*  Diva out.

       Beyond Help  Something kind of strange happened last night so of course I had to write about it.  Actually, yesterday was strange in lots of ways.  But nevermind all that.  What I want to write about is how hopeless I think it may be for the DBD now.    I finally decided to clear away any and all feelings of hurt, anger, jealousy and whatever else may be lurking about in my mental garden regarding him.  I then said a little prayer for him and lit an incense to carry my wishes upward.  Do you believe that the incense wouldn't light... and once it did light, it just fizzled out.  It wouldn't burn.  I took it as a sign that even though I've forgiven him, he has some work of his own to do.  So, I asked the incense to bless my work instead.  It burnt for over an hour.  Go figure.

       revenge is mine?  Always thinking and always considering the other point of view... or at least trying to.  Yesterday I was thinking about how my ex-husband gave up everything for the woman he now lives with.  He gave up a stable and comfortable life with his wife & children to be with her.  In certain circumstances it seems like a wonderful thing - giving up everything for true love... I just hope she was worth it.  I mean that wholeheartedly.  If he's found "the one" then he did what was right for his heart and soul.  Of course, that doesn't excuse him from his financial and paternal responsibilities... he may still learn to balance everything properly.  And then I started thinking, as bad as its been for me, he hasn't had it so easy either.  In the past three years, he lost the best paying job he'd ever had, he was evicted and ended up moving in with the new girlfriend (perhaps only out of necessity?), was unemployed for almost a year, then lost his new job after only 3 months.  On top of that, he has been the subject of child support enforcement legal action and now has a warrant out for his arrest.  Pretty shitty year, if you ask me.  All I can wonder is, is she worth it?  And while she has stood beside him through a lot, will she stand firm through whatever else comes?    Then, there is this little, ugly satisfaction in knowing that once he left my happy little world, he lost it all.  Diva out.

       an afterthought  Always be careful what you ask for, because what you want will come.  But the Universe sometimes has a very twisted sense of humor.  I was wanting a man who was interested in a commitment... what I got was a man who was already in a commitment.  Now that I think on it, all of the men I met this past year were in a relationship with someone else.  Only it took me a little while to figure it out. *sigh*  Come on 2003... and I promise to be more careful about what I ask for.  Diva out.

       and it just keeps coming  While mentioning a friend's name to someone today, the co-worker in the conversation says, "You know he got married last August, right?  Yeah, he married so-and-so who used to work with us."  I tried to retain my composure, because I'm thinking back to when I saw him in October, and he wasn't acting like a married man.  Hmm, go figure.  So, I've put out a call to verify what I'm sure is the truth.  I figure, I'll give him the chance to come clean, since I'm not going to ever see him again anyway.  See exactly what category of creep he is... one caught up in emotional overload or one who just likes to get away with all he can.  Can't wait to see how this one turns out.

       Oh, now its working   This morning I had wanted to write happy little thoughts about things that make me happy.  But the publishing tool for my blog wasn't working.  And now all the happy thoughts are gone.  Why, you ask?  Well, after not receiving any notice or money regarding the purge payments from my dead-beat-dad ex-husband.  I had been receiving both on a pretty regular basis up until the first week of November.  Then, nothing.  No little love notes from the state attorney's office telling me that he showed up for the court date.  No little envelopes containing the check that was keeping him out of jail.  It all stopped cold.  So, I called the State Attorney's Office for Child Support today.  First I had to hold for 20 minutes, then give the ritual information of name, social security number, current address, yadda yadda, ad naseum.  Then, I finally got to tell the nice lady that I just want to know what's going on.  She advised me that a warrant was issued for his arrest last month, when he didn't show up with the purge payment.    Of course, I have reservations about how this will affect my karma.  However, considering the guy is now unemployed and no longer contributing to the support of his children, I say let him serve his 45 days.  At this point, it makes no difference to me at all.    As long as I don't have to explain to my children why Daddy can't visit us for Christmas.  Diva out.

       Monday again  Another week ahead, and according to my  urlLink horoscope guy , it has some significance. Something to do with the solar eclipse and Jupiter.    All I know is, I'm now 33 and very pleased about that.  It's funny how when I tell someone how old I am, they say I look much younger.  Like, somehow, younger is better, more attractive and thereby more valuable.  All my life I've wanted to look my age, not younger.  I've always looked forward to 40, but all of a sudden I realize... didn't Jesus and Buddha realize their true identity at 33?  I'm at a good age, and I want to make the most of every minute!  Had a great birthday, spent it with some very dear friends; had two cosmopolitans too many and at my age you'd think I would know better.  But, I made my sacrificial offering to the great porcelain god on the morning of my 33rd birthday, and I believe that I am blessed for the rest of the year.  Diva out.

       My Internet Garden   I realize that I have been a little preoccupied with blogging.  What with daily entries, keeping up with all of my blogging friends, and then there's that "NextBlog" link with promises of something new and undiscovered.  The internet has a way of creeping slowly into your daily activities, like some creeping vine.  Before you know it, all of your time is tangled up in e-mail, IM, music videos and online journals.  Well, I already stay online all day at work anyway - the system automatically logs me in.  At least my private life hasn't been invaded by the internet... I don't have a computer at home *gasp*.  But now I have a cell phone with a browser, and am considering upgrading my service -- and then I will be completely overwhelmed by IM and blogging!  Hmmm... addiction?  Is there an Internet version of AA?  Amazing the things you have to be concerned about these days.  Not watching too much tv, but spending too much time online.  Either way, you're spending all of your time staring into a brightly lit screen.  And of course, since I do this at work, there is the special consideration of trying to get work done in between my online forays.  Heaven forbid I lose my job over the internet -- how ever would I ever get online then?  So, today I'm tending to my work, trimming the entry to keep it short, and staying out of the weeds.  So much to do!  Diva out.

       One man's trash...  is another man's treasure, so they say (whoever "they" are).  I had a threesome of this yesterday, so I figured it earned a place in blog history.  First, I had a client call to ask about a local magazine that we recieve here at the hotel regularly for our guests.  It has Pamela Anderson on the cover of its 10th Anniversary Issue (January 03), and he knows someone in Kid Rock's band who can get Pamela to autograph it for him.  It was such a big deal for him that I promised to do my best and get my hands on two of them as he asked.   Turns out, all I had to do was walk down to our Housekeeping department and ASK.  We have tons of them.    So, off they went to my guest up north, and he's so very grateful and what can he do to repay me?  Well, he's a jewelry broker, so I'm sure we'll think of something.  *sparkle-sparkle*  Then, there was the request at daycare posted to the door upon entering.  Please bring in three empty film canisters and an empty tissue box.  Trash, that I would keep lying around just for such instances.  Actually, I just threw a tissue box away last Friday, and I left 3 film canisters at my mother-in-law's house over the weekend to get the film inside developed.  The children are making instruments - except for mine of course, because I threw all of that stuff away!  And then there was the binder I found tucked away on a shelf yesterday.  I use lots of binders at work -- lots of 'em.  I need a new 2 inch binder to replace an old 2 inch binder that has busted out of its 2 inches.  So, I went to remove one from a shelf that's been sitting there unnoticed for who know's how long.  I check with my office mates to make sure it's OK I take this particularly lovely 2 inch binder for my own.  All of a sudden, one of my colleagues decides that the information inside could be valuable to him, and please don't use THAT binder.  And as it turned out, he started using the info in that binder today and it has been very useful indeed.  Go figure.  Diva out.

       Blogger's Back   But I have nothing clever to say today.  My head hurts, and I suspect it is due to my sinus using my left eyeball as a punching bag.  That's where the ache is concentrated, but with the help of a little extra strength something or other, I should be feeling a little better (and more medicated) soon.  As an afterthought, it seems my beneficence is at work with my current number 1.  He's being considered for a job making a ridiculous amount of money, which makes him very happy.  And, it will put him closer to me for 6 months out of the year.  The other 6 will put him in Missouri.  Um... does anyone here know where that is?  Somewhere cold, I'm sure.

      And now, here's a perfect example of why I prefer Miami.  Thank you  urlLink Mimi Smartypants  for making this thermal annoyance so very clear to our readers.   "Also, the most unsexy striptease in the history of people taking off their clothes is the one I do huddled up next to the radiator before getting naked to shower, because first I take off the gigantoid sweatshirt that I wear while reading and drinking tea in the mornings, with the hood up and the fingerless mitten cuff things over my hands. Then there are pajama pants and wool socks to be shed, and the flannel shirt under the sweatshirt, and the t-shirt under that, and the underwear, and this whole time I have the shower going already to try and steam up the bathroom a bit. And my skin is very dry and scaly in this weather, so I wish I could have a Lotion Shower right next to the regular shower. I read somewhere that to combat dry skin in the winter you are supposed to take lukewarm showers but sorry, thank you for playing, that sounds awful."   I generally sleep in a tank/t-shirt and light-weight cotton pajama pants.  Not exactly diva-licious, but very comfy.  And, what's a radiator?  Diva out.

       A visitor's view  I am not at liberty to say from where I got these remarks.  Let's just say, hypothetically, if I was a certain diva who puts postage on all outgoing mail from, hypothetically, a hotel, I would then, hypothetically, have a chance to read postcards from guests to their friends and family back home.  Hypothetically.  Dude, Miami kind of sucks. All the girls dress like whores down here.   Even in the morning.   Even the grandmas.   Weird.  I hope that the hypothetical writer of this hypothetical postcard never reads this hypothetical blog entry.  Diva out... hypothetically. *grin*

       A Diva's work is never done  I did it.  I don't know how, but I did it.  I moved from one apartment to another, from the 25th floor to the 7th, all in one weekend.  Started around 1pm on Saturday and finished by 5:30pm on Sunday.  Of course, I could never have done it without my friends and family who volunteered to help a Diva out in her time of need.  There were 8 of us in all, the guys moved the heavy furniture and the rest of us girls moved everything else gypsy style - on wheels and in bags, down the elevator to the new apartment.  No packing or unpacking, just move it from one place and put it in its new place.  Everything is in its place, even have the pictures on the walls.  And, while I had to give up the 25th floor view, I must admit that I like my new, closer to the ground view.  I hear the birds singing in the trees in the morning and yesterday I heard church bells.  It made for a very nice Sunday morning.  I have a very sunny balcony, and a great view of Downtown Miami.  And the rent is a little more than $100 cheaper.  A Diva's gotta do what a Diva's gotta do.   And now a Diva's gotta get some work done, so...  Diva out.

       I love this man!  You know those days when your horoscope is just so totally on target that even you can't believe it?  Well, this is one of those days.     urlLink Astrology - Horoscopes - Jonathan Cainer's Zodiac Forecasts  Friday, 24th January 2003 SAGITTARIUS  (Nov 23 - Dec 21)   Some while ago, you asked a very good question. Ever since then, you have been on the lookout for a good answer. You have heard lots of explanations. You have contemplated many alternatives. You remain though, unsure about the best way to proceed. Now, you are remembering the reason why you asked that question in the first place. Don't feel frustrated because you don't, so far, have a satisfactory plan you can believe in. Just look, once more, at the issue you are trying to address. One more insight will soon make sense of everything.   I have been remembering the reason for the question... all night long.  My hesitation from yesterday tainted my dreams.  But I woke up this morning remembering what it is I want, and remembering that my life is determined by me - not by anyone else - man or not.  I believe I've made a good decision and am content with it.  Moving forward into my future has become my newest mantra.  I feel good today, and Jonathan Cainer has reassured me further.

       Not feeling quite so Inspired now  Nothing like breaking the news to door number 4 about door number 3 to ruin a good mood.  And, I realize that I have issues with losing people.  So, telling him about my newest development when he had NO CLUE was very hard for me.  Shakes my faith in my own convictions; and let's face it until recently I've never been very good about sticking to my convictions.    My hands were shaking, and I felt queasy while telling him that I am now seeing someone else.    So, after I finished telling him, I called my number 3, who is currently the number 1 and only.   His voice reassured me (a little) and now my hands aren't quite so shaky.  I'm thinking lunch is out of the question though.  Diva out.

       Feeling a little poetic today...  Mansi shared a poem with me yesterday that I really liked.  So, today I'm feeling inspired to share a little rhyme.  It's really very old, and has very little to do with how I'm feeling today - see my current mood over there!  But, I like this one and, after all, this is my blog and I can do what I want here.  At least there is one place in the world where I can!  "Chesire Moon" The crescent moon Grins menacingly like the Chesire Cat. So now I am Alice.  With a toothy grin he bears down on  my wishful heart Sneering,  Happiness?  There is  no such thing.  Nothing but the black night and the malicious moon that cuts it.   On another note, I took my girls to a Heat game last night.  That's basketball for the sports-impaired reader.  I got three free tickets, and couldn't think of anyone better to spend my Wednesday night with. My girls had a great time screaming and blowing a horn for our team.  The littlest one had no idea what was happening and would ask me, "Now, Mommy?"  Yes, now, baby. Scream your little head off.  Better here than at home.    We left at half time because, let's face it; two little girls get bored after an hour or so.  But it was a great time, and they each left with a Miami Heat shirt.  They just think they're the coolest girls on the planet today.  And, they're right.    Diva out.

       Happy Girl  First of all, I did the Wine Club thing last night.  We hosted the US Sommelier Assocation French Wine Gala featuring over 150 wines.  Yes, 150.  We packed the room with over 200 people, and the wine flowed for 2 hours.  It was amazing.  Everyone had a great time, the wines were fabulous and all I got out the whole evening was three sips of a Veuve Cliquot Rose.  But, boy was it good.  The Dinner that followed had a bit of fiasco at seating, but in the end it worked out and everyone enjoyed themselves.  I ducked out at 10pm, leaving the revelers to finish the evening out on their own.  After trekking over to Hialeah for the girls, I finally got home about 11pm.  Needless to say, I got into the office a little later than usual today.    I did have a really nice thing happen this morning that I just had to share.  My little one went on an errand with me to the bank this morning before I dropped her off at daycare.  Outside the bank she plucked a dandelion flower, which kept her entertained on the ride to daycare.  Just before we got there, she noticed that the stem was broken, so she said it was dying.  She was very sad about this, and I explained that once you pick a flower it's going to die.    She decided that we should replant the little flower.  It became her little mission this morning to find a suitable home for her little flower outside the daycare.  She "planted" it among some other flowers in a planter outside the daycare door.  She seemed very pleased with herself, for having saved the little flower.  I immediately felt a rush of pride and love for my littlest daughter.  Her little heart has love and compassion for even the smallest flower, and I hope that she maintains that quality as she grows.  I was also filled with hope; if this one little girl can have so much love, maybe there are more like her.  As they grow, they could create what a few of us long for now.  A peaceful, loving world filled with compassionate people.    It's a far cry from replanting a plucked dandelion... or is it?  Diva out.

       Back to the Gameshow of Life  Well, my dear internet friends, my last weekend was a spinning roulette wheel of dating.  Doors were opened, and some were left closed.  I opened door number 4.  Remember how sad it was, when the player opened their door of choice only to find, not "A new car!", but a donkey and wagon, flanked by some lovely gameshow model?  Well that was door number 4.  So, before I even stepped through it, I decided to close it back up, and move on.  Door number 3 asked to be opened, and I've taken a step inside.  It's nice there.  Warm, reassuring, encouraging.  And he sees all that my friends see in me - all the good things that make me the Diva that I am.  Yeah, he's worthy of a Diva like me.  Bob, I'll take Door Number 3, please.

       Too cold for me!  Working on a Saturday, but I'm on my new computer and it is soooo fast, I'll be done with all of my long overdue workload so I can start Monday fresh.  And I still have time to update my blog ;)  But, as my title up there mentions, and as my little weather tramp over there indicates, it is friggin' cold today.  Doesn't that woman have a digital mink or something for days like this?    As I have said before, I live in Miami for a reason... and 52 degrees isn't it.  It's cold, it's damp, and even the sun is staying wrapped up today - hidden underneath wooly blankets of clouds.  My office has no heat, with a window taking up one corner of the room.  What I wouldn't do for an illegally hidden teapot under my desk to toast my toes right now!  May try warming my fingertips over the back of my monitor later.  Diva out.

       Grumble and Growl   Almost 2 weeks ago I called my Insurance Agent, who had always proven himself to be very knowledgeable and helpful in the world of auto insurance.  I don't sell auto insurance, so I don't know anything more than how to pay my premium.  God forbid I have to make a claim, but if so, I'd call him.  The Omniscient One, as far as I'm concerned for insurance.  I called him to ask advice on making my LAST PAYMENT for the policy.  I had received the notice of intent to cancel, and I had until Tuesday the 7th to pay.  I told him I had two options - either borrow the money from someone and pay on time, or I would wait until Thursday the 9th when I got paid.  He advised that while the policy would be cancelled, payment would be accepted and the policy would be reinstated.    So, I followed his sage advise, and paid on the 10th.  Mr. Omniscient said that paying late would be okay, and I believed him.  What a schmuck I am!  Last night I got the notice that, while the payment had been recieved, it was declined and the insurance was not reinstated.  So, I've been driving around for a week without insurance, and $200 lighter in my pocket.  I could have used that $200 for the rent.  So, I called Mr. Omniscient first thing this morning, and he's all, well, the payment was late, and now you have to buy a whole new policy.  I'm thinking he knew all along that this would happen - I'm sure he gets commission on new policies.   Of course I figure this out a little too late.  I am getting a refund in the mail, which will help to pay for a new policy, but I am NOT going to use that disceptive little creep of an insurance salesman.  I'm a little wiser, with $200 back in my pocket, and searching for another quote online.  And considering the Mercury Retrograde that I was fully warned about, I really shouldn't be at all surprised by the turn of events.    But I am and I'm pissed off.  Add to that broke, and that's me in a nutshell.  Life as a Diva isn't always what its cracked up to be.  Diva out.

       Other People's Children  Other people's children are never as cute as mine. Or as well-behaved.  Yesterday, the hotel was the site of a casting call for children.  The day started with cute toddlers tagging along behind young mothers with apparently no job to prevent them from hanging around our hotel lobby all day.  I'm thinking the kids are earning the paycheck in those families.  As the day progressed, the ages progressed, so that by 5pm there was a very noisy collection of children in ages ranging from 2 upward to about 10.  By this point, the bored children and likewise bored mothers were not paying attention to each other.  Kids running around the lobby to keep themselves occupied, mothers vying for preferential treatment from the casting directors.    Noisy chattering children, running around unattended.  My own kids can get on my nerves even in their best behavior.  These were not my kids.  If they were, I would've whacked 'em but good. *grin*  Diva out.

       This is an improvement?  I'm getting a new, updated computer today.  Which, of course, will take me some time to get familiar with.  Yeah, I know computers, and I love technology, but I'm working with Windows NT here.  Moving up to XP and all the idiosynchrasies that come with it.  Still, it will be faster than what I'm working on now.  As it is, I can send a document to the printer, go down two flights of stairs, put 2 quarters into the coke machine, coke drops, go back up two flights of stairs, sit at my desk, open the coke, and voila, my document begins to print.  I'm not kidding.  And they wonder why I don't get to a lot of things.  Of course, working on my blog has nothing to do with my uncompleted work load *wink*  But, the clincher is this... now that I'm getting the fabulous new toy with a larger monitor and black casing I'll be in another software training for 4 hours of every day from now till January 25th.  That gives me 4 hours to complete 8 hours of work each day on my fabulous new toy.  You just can't win around here.  Diva out.

       Tuesday will be better  If I say that enough times, it will come true.  Mondays, I've realized, are probably the worst day of the week for me.  I don't think it has much to do with going back to work after having 2 days off, because I often work on a Saturday or Sunday to catch up.  I have discovered a pattern, whereby the man behind door number 4 doesn't call me on Mondays.  That may have something to do with my Mundane Mondays.  My kids get on my nerves on Mondays.  My bosses (note plural) get on my nerves.  I'm edgy, unfocused and hyper-sensitive on Mondays.  And by the time 9PM comes around, I am completely exhausted from just trying to get through the day.  But now it's Tuesday, Glorious Tuesday.  I'm focused, I'm rested, I'm ready.  Um *cough*... just one more cup of coffee.  Yeah, one more cup and I'll be ready.  And maybe a nice buttery croissant, with some strawberry jam.  And another hour of sleep.  Yeah, that's all I'll need to be ready for Tuesday.    And, of course, the possibility of a phone call from door number 4.  Diva out.

       Oh the choices!  Will it be Door #1, Door #2, or Door #3?  I had three dates this weekend!  All of which came up very suddenly, without much planning.  Last night, through a splitting headache, I realized that the universe had put me on some cosmic game show.  Date number one offered all of the excitment and fantasy that I used to drown myself in.  Notice I said used to.  Date number two offered all of the intellectual stimulation and stories of world travel that make my heart beat faster and cloud my mind with vision of far-off lands.  Date number three offered sound financial security and the good things in life.  And then there's number 4.  Who somehow managed to call me before or during each of those dates.  What does door number 4 offer?  Ah, that is yet to be discovered, but he lies somewhere deep in my heart, and the promise of what's to come entices me to learn what is to be discovered.  I hate game shows.  Diva out.

       So now I'm Dorothy  And apparently, my ruby red slippers are working.  See entry from 1/10/03 below if you're confused.  --I have been granted a little more time to finish paying this month's rent. --I have been offered a purportedly better apartment (with a lovely south view of Downtown Miami) for $150 less per month. --We let a salesperson go (the one with the bug up her ass), and since I did a great deal of her work now a more competent and computer literate salesperson is stepping into her shoes (not ruby red). --As a result of all of this financial maelstrom, DBD and I are on speaking terms again.  For the children, this is a good thing.  My review is soon - and I swear I'd better get at least the maximum allowable increase, or I'm gonna click my heels again and see what else I can make happen!  Diva out.

Frustrated and broke, and trying to hold my head up as I receive an onslaught of cancellation and eviction notices.  What's a diva to do?  I started taking a mental inventory this morning of all of my worldly possessions, wondering, "What can I sell?"  Problem is I sold everything I could in the first round of this crap last year.  Just going to be more resourceful, call the DBD and tell him to solve a few of these problems for me, and figure out where to borrow a couple hundred dollars to pay the rent.  And, clicking my heels in Dorothy fashion, "It's going to get better.  It's going to get better."  Diva out.

       They don't call me the Administrative Diva for nothing!  My official title is Administrative Diva, which of course gave birth to The Diva is In, and downtowndiva.

       Raise your hand if you're sure  I'm not sure why I'm so confident these days.  Maybe its something that comes with age.  I was thinking last night about how I'm no longer insecure about my body.  At 33, after two children, I'm in pretty good shape, "kept my figure" as they say.  I'm not big on exercise, although I do enjoy yoga and the occasional run on the beach.  I used to be much more active.  When I was younger (and weighed less) I was so self-concious about my body - especially on those wonderful occasions when I got to be naked with someone.  I've always enjoyed the sensation of being naked next to someone else who was naked.  But, I would try to cover this little curve or that, uncertain of what unkind image it may be portraying of me.  But lately, on those now (unfortunately!) rare occasions when I get to be naked with someone, I don't even think about my body.  I don't care what image it portrays.  I guess I'm just comfortable in my own skin these days.  And let's face it, if I'm comfortable enough with a man to be naked, I'm going to be pretty sure he likes what I've got to offer anyway!   Maybe yoga has helped me to accept exactly who I am, and nevermind the body I'm encased in.  Form is my manifestation, and whatever you read in my body's shape and size has much to do with what I eat and how active I am.  But it doesn't have much to do with my soul and Self.  I have always hoped that as I grew older, I would get wiser.  If this is all I get, I'll be fine.  It's nice to finally not freak out about the skin I'm in.  Diva out.

       Clean Up Time  New Year started, and I decided to clean up my blog, for starters.  Taking off "Juan is a Loser", because I think he must have gotten over that chick in Asia since his last entry in September 02.  Added the infamous referrer list to my page; we'll just see what comes of that little gremlin.  Added a list of what I'm reading.  I borrowed the idea from Grayblog; I like his lists about him on the right side of his blog.  I also like the countdown on CandyGenius, but I'm not going to even try to figure out that script.  I'm not a scripting genius... still waiting on the results of the referrer, remember?  The blog cleanup is just the beginning.  I am planning on moving to a slightly smaller apartment, in the same building, to pay less rent.  With no child support payments on the horizon, I'm thinking smaller apartment is better than no apartment.  And I didn't really like cleaning that 2nd bathroom anyway.  New Year bringing new opportunities, new vision and a renewed energy to conquer the unconquerable.  I'm queen of the world!  Oh, was that too much enthusiasm for you?  Sorry.

       Gotta love him!  I sent this littel tidbit to my boss, telling him that instead of Adminitrative Diva, we should put this on my business cards.  factotum \fak-TOH-tuhm\ (noun)   *1 : a person having many diverse activities or responsibilities  2 : a general servant        Did you know? "Do everything!" That's a tall order, but it is exactly what a factotum is expected to do. It's also a literal translation of the New Latin term "factotum," which in turn traces to the Latin words "facere" ("to do") and "totum" ("everything"). In the 16th century, "factotum" was often used in English as if it was a surname, paired with first names to create personalities such as "Johannes Factotum" (literally "John Do-everything"). Back then, it wasn't necessarily desirable to be called a "factotum"; the term was a synonym of "meddler" or "busybody." Now the word is more often used for a handy, versatile individual responsible for many different tasks.  His reply?  "LOL.  Be careful with the spelling...."  A little devious humor never hurt anyone! *grin*  Diva out.

       Couldn't have said it better myself!  Borrowed this *ahem* from another blog... the sentiment expressed is very much like my own.  All except for that thinning hair bit.  Graying, but not thinning.  Oh, and I could never, not ever, want a farm in Iceland (or anywhere else for that matter.)  Okay, disclaimer over.  Read on, dear reader!  Tuesday, December 31, 2002   Happy New Year!  I'd like to take this time to say hello, and goodbye, and wish everyone a warm year's ending. Personally, this year, the palindrome of all years: 2002, in many ways has been one of the most successful for me, and in other ways I detested waking up and wanted to hide under my bed for hours and days on end, but alas, we must move forward and embrace out journeys through life. 2002 reflects upon itself, as I looked in the mirror, staring at my reflection, an image I cannot fake to the world. My face has new changes, my hair is a lot less these days (and thinning), my eyes have grown more cynical, my voice has grown stronger, and my focus to live boldly and write truthfully and take risks seems to led me back on track... 2002 reflects itself, as I too reflected upon myself to see many things: good, bad, and ugly. We are who we are, and we're going to go where we're headed, and I wish everyone sanity, peace, joy, happiness on your trip through 2003, and I hope one of you wins the lottery this year so you can lend me $50,000 for a down payment on a farm in Iceland. With that being said, I consider myself a wealthy man, not because of my net worth, but rather the people in my life who love, listen, support and inspire me. My wealth is a result of my friendships, and because of you, I must say... Thanks.   Happy New Year.   Be Sweet!  urlLink Pauly  31 Dec 2002

The very nice colleague who sits across the room from me (arms length really) and who has to hear me constantly chatting with myself and laughing at unspoken jokes from my computer screen, has a bag of m's in her drawer, which she takes one or two from on any given day.

       Better today  Not feeling quite so overwhelmed today.  For no apparent reason, just feeling better.  Must have something to do with the planets or something.  Must see what Jonathan has to say today.  The hotel is buzzing, we're the host and headquarters for The Miami International Film Festival.  The lobby is full of people, we have events every night this week (including the Wine Club on Thursday night) and as we all know, I am happiest when I am busy.  And when the hotel is busy, I am busy.  Which is why I haven't had much time for blogging or surfing.  Work keeps interfering.  But I had a good weekend, except for sleeping in a recliner on Saturday night.  No matter what anyone ever tells you, the recliner is NOT a good alternative to a bed.  My neck is so stiff that I sometimes catch myself walking with my head hunched down because it doesn't hurt that way.  Like those old men you see waiting for a bus with his head hunched way too far forward to be comfortable, and you think for a split second, "What's he looking for?"  But that's just the way he holds his head... and now that's almost how I hold my head too.  Stretching is helping to hold my head high again.  Some official office closed down the daycare yesterday.  They painted over the weekend and the smell was so strong that the City or somebody official, Dept of Health? came, took one whiff of the paint smell and shut them down.  2 days of no daycare.  I brought the littlest diva into the office yesterday for a few hours. Luckily it was naptime while she was here and I was able to get some work done while she slept.  Today she is with Grandma - once again thank goodness for Grandma!  The daycare should be open again tomorrow and life will be back to what I call normal.  Kala is set to go on her first overnight school-sponsored field trip.  She goes to St. Augustine in March with her class.  I told her in the beginning of the year that if she was selected to go I would find the money somehow for her to go.  She's always had issues with paying attention and being quiet in class, and behavior was taken into consideration for this trip.  Not all kids are going, but my baby is on the list!  So, I had to get the cash together.  Not easy, but that's why I worked 28 hours weekend before last.  She lived up to her part of the bargain so I kept my word.  And perhaps the reason I'm feeling so good today; I had a happy little phone call this morning returning a call from last night.  Sometimes its just nice to hear a friendly voice say, "Have a good day!" first thing in the morning.  Because, I am.  Diva out.

       Why, why, why?!  What is it about men?  Why is it that when you finally decide to step back, they want to step forward?  I have been seeing several men on a very irregular basis.  Several means 4 or 5 and the number varies because they all contact me so sporadically.  It comes in cycles, like feast or famine, you know?    Well, as I mentioned in an earlier post, Door number 3 stepped up and asked for more.  I accepted the offer, but now he's moving to Missouri and we don't speak on a regular schedule.  It was very short-lived and I need a more regular guy.  I've started pursuing another avenue, one that has remained constant and in the background and always with a promise of something truly wonderful.  Very far away and difficult to hold on to, but hope springs eternal.  My focus has shifted.  But in the meantime, while I was making number 3 my number 1,  I informed all of the scattered few that I was no longer accessible to them.  Friend yes, "friend" No.   My love life hasn't been this busy (or confusing) in ages!  One now says he loves me (via e-card on Valentines Day -- too impersonal for me to feel it).  Another has asked to see me 3 weeks in a row.  Another that I haven't even heard from or seen in months calls me out of the blue and wants to get together.  Then there's the one that I've been letting go of for at least a year now, but he still calls and still says he loves me and 10 years from now we'll be married and living better than ever.  Nevermind the fact that I don't take half of any of this interest with a grain of salt.  But, WHY!?  As soon as you tell them no, they're all over you.  Of course I understand the mentality - can't have it so you want it even more.  But, Argh!  And some of these are truly considered friends, if only I could get the sex out of the "friend"ship.  Working on that...  *Sigh*  I guess I shouldn't complain - its not a bad problem to have I guess.  It could be worse.  But at a time when I really want something true and constant, it makes it hard to stick to one decision.  Hmmm... decisions, decisions.  Diva out.

       I'm Back  Took the day off yesterday and pretended I was a tourist.  I had family visiting from Oregon and West Palm Beach, so we all checked in to a hotel (not the one I work in).  It was fun to be on the other side of the hotel business for a while.  I took two of my cousins (in their late 20's) out on the town on a TUESDAY night.  Yes, there was actually lots to do on a Tuesday night on South Beach.  We started at a bar, then moved over to a hotel and bar owned by Chris Blackwell of Island Records (Bob Marley's manager or something).  Great place with a real smooth vibe.  We ended sitting in the lower part of the bar, slouched down on purple and red cushions with our shoes off listening to spoken word and jazz.    My cousin is convinced that one of the poets was speaking and singing directly to me - and I like her way of thinking.  He was tall, dark and oh, so smooth.  I was encouraged at the end of the evening to go and speak to him.  So I told him I was feeling him and liked what he had to say.  Word.  Great night followed by a great day by the pool with a brilliant February sun shining down on us.  85 degrees, cool breeze and not a cloud in the sky. Even floated in a hammock between two palms trees with my littlest one nestled up next to me.  Completely lost track of time.  But it did come to an end and by 6pm I was back at home with my girls, back in reality.  It was nice, and now I'm back at the office and back at my computer.  The only glowing thing in here is my monitor.  But I do have the remnants of a little sun on my face to remind me of yesterday's dream.  Diva out.

       I found Me!  While checking out  urlLink Candy Genius  this morning, I followed a link to Google that she likes.  The  urlLink Elmer Fudd version .  While there, I "googled" Downtown Diva, to see what would come up, and  urlLink I WAS THERE!   My blog was like number 3 or 4 on the list.  For me, it's like seeing your picture in the high school year book, or finding your name in the phone book for the first time.  It doesn't really take much to make me happy.  Just a simple girl with simple needs.  It somehow satisfies my deep high-school-ish need to be included.  I know I'm supposed to be unconcerned with what everyone thinks of me, but I am one of now on the list.  I am google-licious!    Diva out.

       Pooped  As in exhausted, tired, wiped out.  This Administrative Diva has learned without the shadow of a doubt that I am definitely an office girl.  I racked up almost 30 hours this weekend... in two days.  I worked 30 out of 48 hours this weekend and I am BEAT!  It wasn't very strenous or physical work really.  Just getting stuff done to make sure convention attendees had a good time.  Put place cards on the banquet tables (all 2000 seats!), helped with prepping for the dinner, putting water glasses on tables as there wasn't enough hotel staff to get it all done.  Greeted attendees and handed them their registration and event packets.  Stuffed bags with gifts for nightly deliveries to all 1800 attendees.  Just stuff that needed to be done.  But 14 1/2 hours each day of it, and this Diva is not accustomed to getting up before the sun (4:30am).  It is so difficult to be gorgeous at 5:30am in a lime green uniform top.  Of course, I managed to pull it off and be the fabulous Diva that I am *wink*  But, there was lots of caffeine involved.  And today, I still need caffeine to keep my dry tired little eyes open.  Tomorrow will be better.   Tomorrow I will be visited by my favorite Aunt, her two daughters and another cousin from the West Coast.  We are going to have a girls night out and sleep in on Wednesday - no work for this Diva.  Just a little fun and sun.    Just what the doctor ordered!  Diva out.

       Valentines Day  Bah - humbug!  Took my girls to an amazing belly dancing performance last night.  It was great, open theater on Lincoln Road - a "pedestrian mall" with shops and sidewalk cafes.  The speakers were 10 feet high, blasting out Middle Eastern music.  The dancers came out by ones and twos, all glittery with their sequins and body glitter.    It really was so entrancing.  We sat there with about 300 other spectators, clapping and making the required "la-la-la-la-la-la!" sound, equivalent to the American "Woooooooooooooo!" or Latin "Epaaaa!".  We had such a great time.  And, it was such a joyful night.  Really.  Watching the beauty of the dance filled me with pure energy and joy - it's not really something I can explain or relay to anyone.  Especially through written word.  All I can say it that I'm going to have to get some belly dancing music this weekend, and there will be two little belly dancers writhing and twirling through my living room all next week.  Kala has already selected a few scarves from her dresser for the performance.  And don't be surprised when I tell you all about my first belly dancing class.    Diva out.

       And My Day Continues to Improve  I may have mentioned before that I have one of the greatest bosses ever.   urlLink  Just one example of his great sense of humor.      Well, today he was the subject of a photo for a local newspaper.  He's not normally in the office until around 1pm on Thursdays, so seeing him at 8:30 threw me way off track.  He was waiting for the photographer to arrive.  So picture this:  A very professional hotel executive, grey wool suit, conservative tie and starched white shirt.  Well groomed 40-something trim and good-looking man (I love a man in a suit!).  Barefoot. *huh?*  Then, he stepped waist-deep into our 2nd swimming pool, and waded over to the middle of the pool.  I'm ready for my close up, Mr. DeMille.  Yes - in the pool with his shades on, in his suit.  It was so much fun to watch, and everyone around the pool was enjoying the view.  When the shoot was over, the view got even better.  Ladies and Gentleman, I have seen my boss in his underwear.  I may be changed for life.  And, nice package *wink*.  I hope I didn't say that out loud.  Well, Valentines Day may be a wash, but today was so much better.  Oh, yeah.  And now there's some guy named Ah-nold lounging around that same pool.  Yes, THE Arnold.  With his arm in a sling from an injury trying to do some stunt.  But for me, the true star has already left the building.  Diva out.

       Another Jonathan Says  Lets get in training for Valentines day. We dont have long so we had better work hard. We will start by finding a cliff top. If we cant travel to one we had best try to make one out of papier-mache. Now we need to practise the art of running towards our partner in slow-motion with arms outstretched. Never mind WHICH partner. Thats the easy bit. The hard part is humming in such a way as to sound like a thousand soaring violins. OK. Are you ready? Steady?... Go! Ill see you tomorrow  and so I suspect will a certain someone else.  So maybe romance isn't dead, as Candygenius suggests.  Maybe someone's alarm clock went off and woke up their heart.  Hmmm.

       Perfectly Described  Jonathan says: Some people feel that heaven is a cake shop where you can eat as much as you like without putting on weight. For others its a tropical paradise or a library full of wonderful books with all the time in the world to read them. Sagittarius heaven is not quite like this. Its a busy place full of excitement and drama. Theres trouble too - and tension. What distinguishes it from normal everyday life? Just one thing. In this other world, your every move works well, your every decision proves wise, your luck ensures that you take it all in your stride.  Yep.  I always say I'm happiest when I am busy.  Gotta have a problem to fix in order to be happy, even if the problem was created by me just so I would have something to fix. *sigh* It's quite an ugly cycle.  Oh, and I'm reading Moliere this week.  Don Juan, The Would-be Gentleman, and The Misanthrope (Miser).  The characters are so overly exaggerated as to be comic, but there's a deep truth in much of it.  It's just beginning to settle in to my understanding, and I feel more and more regret for not attending college.  I would have read most of these years ago had I been a student.    I'm still growing up, and only now beginning to realize some things that others figured out a long long time ago.  Then again, I always did enjoy being the naive little fool that I am when it comes to life.  But, I'm figuring out that there are certain rules that everyone follows.  Rules stink.

       Got on my walkin' shoes   Feel like a little virtual travel?  Check out  urlLink Taiwan .    Just got an e-mail from a friend while she was checking her e-mail at the airport in Hong Kong.  Returning home from her trip to South Asia.  For me, knowing that message traveled from Hong Kong to me was like getting a post card.  I'm adding it to my collection.  And, I was sent a pic from another friend from his travels to Helsinki.  There's this medieval-looking castle-like church or something behind him, and he's all wrapped up in a heavy coat with a scarf covering his face up to the ears.  Snow all around.  Looks cold.  He's so lucky to have been there.  One day I'll send everyone a picture of me in front of that place.  Diva out.

       Not Munday Anymore  I was reminded yesterday that I really don't like Mondays.  They have some horribly oppressive effect on me, and they make my heart sad.  Literally.  And then, of course we have the impending horrors of Valentines Day, and I was again reminded that I really really don't like Valentines Day.  There are so many reasons for it, and the Top 10 below are just the beginning.  I was thinking last night about the pressure of the holiday, and how hopes are never quite fulfilled and dreams never fully realized.    Nevermind that whatever romantic bones I had in my body are now all broken.  My rose colored glasses have faded to black.  Does that happen with age, or is it just because of how I've absorbed my own personal experiences?  Is romance dead - or have I killed it in my own heart?  I have a whole week to contemplate this question.  Culminating in a day of paper hearts and chocolates.  Thank goodness I had the foresight to get myself scheduled to a weekend of working - 20 hours this weekend to keep me busy and my mind occupied.  The busier I am the happier I am.  Diva out.

        urlLink Top 10 Worst Ways to spend Valentines Day   10.  Dressed in a red dress with white stockings, and dangly red heart earrings.  Hmm... red shoes or white?   9.  Pretending all day long that you actually LIKE Valentines Day, and wishing all a "Happy" one with a grin plastered on your face. 8.  Fretting over which of the 15 valentines YOU sent goodies and cards to will actually respond in kind. 7.  Telling your mother in law what a wonderful son she has, and Yes, I'm sure that although he has deserted you both and run off to Zimbabwe with a toothless hot dog vendor, that it has not diminished in the least his outstanding character.   6.  Commiserating with ANYONE about her biological clock. 5.  Receiving unwanted Valentines from desperate coworkers who are just dying to get laid - and they think you are just as desperate! 4.  Sending unwanted Valentines to coworkers because you are just dying to get laid! 3.  Any and all contact with old lovers, flirting with the wishful thinking that NOW they're not losers and could actually be worth your time. 2.  Watching every romantic comedy from Moonstruck to One Fine Day, Sliding Doors to Serendipity alone with the biggest tub of buttered popcorn you can find and wondering why you can't have that perfect little romance - or that perfect little belly button. 1.  Getting toasted alone in a singles bar looking for a new Valentine.  Results in a glowing neon sign over your head that says "I'm Easy, Big Boy! Come and get me."    Diva out.

       Munday  *sigh*  I was inspired on Friday to write a lengthy essay on why I want to be 5 years old again.  But the responsibilities of my grown up self deterred me.  I wanted to expound on the freedom and joy of being 5, but the drudgery of single parenthood prevented me.    I want my mommy!  But then, there was the excursion to  urlLink Madame's  gain. As entertaining as ever - but there's something disturbing about envying a man for his feminine qualities, and wishing you had his taste in dresses and heels!  *sigh again*  Peeing in the bathroom with a man in the next stall was an interesting twist to the already twisted evening.  The men's room was broken, so it became a co-ed potty.  But, I've been to New York, so I was fine with it.  Remember Ally McBeal?  And, it's always great to inform someone new that I have a 10 year old and an almost 4 year old.  "Wow - you don't look old enough to have a 10 year old!"  Thank you, thank you very much.

       Happy Friday Everybody!  My newest online addition - since I now have SPEAKERS! - is listening to streaming radio from all over the world.  I've listened to New York, Seattle and Copenhagen. Today I'm "in" Manila.    As for my postcard collection, I received one from Australia yesterday and a friend in NY just promised to send one from  Taiwan - from his trip last December.  The idea is to create a travel itinerary for future reference - I want to go to all of the places that I have postcards from.  But for now, I travel vicariously through my friends and my online radio.  Hope this isn't as far as I ever get!  I must have been a Viking or gypsy in a past life.  I NEED TO ROAM!

       Eureeka!  Apparently sleep deprivation is good for something.  After finally falling asleep around midnight, last night/this morning somewhere between 4am (after my little one woke me up to get her a little warm milk to go back to sleep) and 5:30am (when I gave up trying to go back to sleep and sat up to read) I figured that I should be able to create links to blog entries.  And, what do you know, I was right.  Of course that was just one of a million and one items running through my "monkey mind" before the sun came up.  Fred - that's a Buddhist term, and while I'm not a Buddhist, it perfectly describes how my mind was travelling from one thought to another. *smirk*  Now I can go back and edit that Columbia entry, and instead of a lengthy entry of plagiarism, I can lead you to the blogs directly.  But now, I think I go for my second cup of coffee.  I think its going to be a looooong and caffeinated day.  Diva out.

       Yay for Me!  Every once in a while, you should be allowed to toot your own horn.  And if not on your own blog, then where?  So,    ---   (that's me tooting my own horn)       (Paraphrased just the good stuff from Today's NEW YORK TIMES, Business Day, 2/4/03)        " Where a Working Trip Can Seem Like Pleasure for Those in Winter's Grip                          By MARCI ALBOHER NUSBAUM        HOTELS        With refurbished Art Deco gems sprouting like mushrooms in South Beach, arguably the most chic stretch of beach in the country, deciding which one to book isn't easy. Monique Skruzny,  [WINE CLUB MEMBER AND NEW BEST FRIEND]   senior vice president for investor relations at AOL Latin America, says the  NATIONAL  (800-550-0505, from $189) is a standout.       "While the SHORE CLUB or DELANO may win points for hipness, I prefer the home-away-from-home feel of the National, where I know I'm going to see the same faces at the front desk each time I visit," she said. Special touches abound, like free homemade strawberry-flavored lemonade at check-in, free Internet service in the lobby cafe and $9-to-$12 meals for the return flight home. Ms. Skruzny also recommends  THE WINE CLUB . "For $20 you can mingle with an international beach set of upscale professionals," she said."   Monique is a friend of the woman who wrote the article, and was contacted to discuss business travel in Miami.  As a Wine Club member, she extolled on the wonders of The National Hotel, where I work, and The Wine Club, which I run.  In fact, The Wine Club is what introduced her to our hotel.    Go Diva!

       Blog Update  on the Diva Books... no disrespect to the Dalai Lama, but his book is boring.  It reads like an old man rambling.  I was very dissapointed.  I loved the Coehlo book, The Pilgrimage.  I have to read more of his work, it touches on the magic that moves around and through each of us every day.  Very inspiring.  Now, I'm reading Whence the Goddesses, A source book.  This thing is fascinating.  Its more like a text book on Indo-European history and mythology, and it touches on some of the information I already knew on a few classic goddesses, like Athena and Aphrodite.  But it offers so much more details on all of the major goddesses that were worshipped throughout history, up to today.  I'm really enjoying reading it.  I have also picked up a collection of plays by Moliere.  I wanted to read Tartuffe, but the Main Library downtown never has any of the books I'm looking for.  So, I have Don Juan and a few other plays.  I'm looking forward to reading it after the Goddesses.  Now, I have tons of work to do.  My boss took yesterday off, since it was his birthday.  He wanted to avoid any birthday surprises and tom-foolery that our staff may have had planned for him.  Such a party-pooper.  And how dare he deny me birthday cake!    Diva out.

       Tribute to our newest heroes  Nevermind the fact that they were already heroes before Friday's tragedy.  One radio station here in Miami decided to play music without DJ's, because "they had a hard time having fun" in the face of the tragedy, and asked that the listeners join them in "saying a prayer TO our new heroes".  Not for our heroes, but to them.  Now, they're gods or patron saints I suppose.  Well, they were in the heavens when it happened.    I can't really express what I felt when I actually heard of the tragedy finally on Sunday afternoon -- I avoid media as much as possible.  And, believe it or not, the whole mail truck hi-jack hi-jinx took precedence on the whole 6 minutes that I did watch of Friday night's news.  I am saddened, but am not able to express how.  I've found some very touching remarks that say more than I ever could.   urlLink Astronomy picture of the day    urlLink  Life on the Ridge - 7 candles lit    Earlier in the week Brian posted about the Challenger Explosion. What are the odds that another shuttle, the Columbia, would be lost just a few days after that anniversary? And within a week of the anniversary of the Apollo disaster?  Kari and I were placing our order for Rick's breakfast sandwich when we heard the announcement over the radio. I couldn't speak. Kari had to climb over to my side and order. She doesn't quite grasp what the big deal is.  How do I explain to her that this has affected me many times more than the events of September 11th?  NASA's space program represents possibilities to me. The loss of the Columbia is a loss of possibilities. What discoveries were closer to being made by the experiments conducted on the shuttles? What worlds would become open to us because of the space program?  We can't dwell on what ifs, but we can feel pain at the loss of what could have been.     urlLink Surreal    urlLink  Saturday, February 01, 2003  - this is truly a sad day.      urlLink  Surreal    urlLink  Rest in peace    I am sad too.

       Winter in Miami as it should be!  Yesterday I took a walk in paradise.  No, really, that's what the city of Bal Harbour hails itself as, "Florida's Paradise".  There's this wonderful path that runs along the ocean, meandering through palm and sea grape trees.  It's gorgeous.  Let me transport you there... I would suggest you close your eyes for this exercise, but then you wouldn't be able to read on.  So, don't.  Pathway of crushed seashells crunches under your feet.  Palm trees stand lazily along the edge of the path, with arms raised to the brilliant blue sky, giggling with the occasional breeze.  Butterflies flutter by and sea birds float overhead.  Ocean waves roll onto the shore, reminding everyone to be respectfully quiet with their shhhhshing.  The warm sun shines down and the breeze makes sure you don't get too warm.  And still the pathway quietly announces your every step.  This is Winter in Miami!    Diva out.

       And later that day...  I received a call today from the father of my children.  I've decided not to call him "my ex" since I really don't want any connection to him.  Although, "my child-support check" would be a nice connection, but that isn't happening any time soon.  So, in all of his unemployed glory, he called today to tell me he wants to take the girls to opening day at The Marlins - that's baseball for the sports-impaired reader.  He's a big baseball fan, and always makes a point to take the girls to a game or two during season.  So, it's opening day and he's going to pick up the girls.  "Okay," I say.  At least he's doing  something  with them, and that's a good thing.  Funny thing is, when he goes to pick up the oldest diva-ette, she doesn't want to go!  She'd rather stay at the Youth Center with her friends, swimming in the pool.  Ha!  So the littlest diva-ette (who really has no say in the matter) goes off with daddy to see The Marlins.  Maybe my oldest daughter is beginning to grow up a little, and daddy isn't quite so perfect?  Or maybe she just prefers the pool to baseball with daddy.  I must admit I found a great deal of satisfaction in this little turn of events, no matter what the cause.  Petty perhaps, but I got a good little snicker out of it nonetheless.  As I've said before, I'm a simple girl with simple needs.  It doesn't take much to make me happy. *grin*  Diva out.

       Ah, Monday  And I'm feeling pretty good.  No explanation for it other than my cold is finally breaking up.  I did a 4-mile walk yesterday along the beach - before the weather turned ugly.   It's so strange, I have a sunburn from yesterday morning, and today, after the terrible storm that tore through here, its 55 degrees.  Last week it was 85, today 55.  Go figure.    I had some friends over on Saturday night to help me polish off a bottle of Cabernet-Merlot.  I made chicken quesadillas that turned out really well - and with guacamole & sour cream... divine!   We had a very laid-back evening and played a little scrabble.  Would you believe they wouldn't let me use "joie" as a word!  "What's that?," they said.  "Its French for joy," I said.  "You can't use French words.  How do you even know how to spell that?!"  After accidently insulting my friend, "Because I have a brain and know how to spell!" (oops) I explained that what I meant to say was that I use the word often - as in 'joie de vivre' - it's used in English and I read French literature.  They didn't buy it -- the Philistines!  But I still won the game.  *smirk*  And now I'm back at the office and ready to get to work  sort of .    Diva out.

       "Your attention please!"  At 4:10AM, that's what woke me up.  A recording of a man's voice, requesting my attention. "There has been an emergency reported in the building.  Please take the stairs to your designated exit or to the main lobby.  Do not take the elevators."  This is exactly what one wants to hear at 4:10 in the morning.  Yep, I'm racing down those stairs in the middle of the night in my jammies just like the man says.  Right.  What I did do is notice that my littlest diva didn't even notice the alarm.  Slept right through it.  I went out onto my balcony to review the situation.  Cool and quiet night, light rain with a chilly breeze.  No firetrucks anywhere around.  No smoke or evidence of chaos.  Of course, the thought did occur that we could be experiencing some sort of bizzare terrorist attack... but that pathetic paranoia faded quickly.  I live in downtown Miami, in a predominantly black neighborhood (yes, the diva lives in "the hood").  Unless there was some poorly misguided attack, I figured it wasn't really likely.  But the damn thing kept going and going.  I remember seeing an apartment building on fire when I was very little, and the sights and smells of all of that came back to me last night.  I started wondering if I should take flight; pick up sleeping beauty and go down to the lobby to see what's what.  I started wondering what I should preserve should a fireman come knocking on my door.  Where's my purse?  Should I take my tax receipts?  Was there anything besides my daughter and my cosmetics that I couldn't live without?  Then after about 15 minutes the man's voice halted... and I was relieved.  Then it started again.  This stop and start tease went on for another 5 or 10 minutes.  Finally at 4:45am all was quiet and I crawled back into my bed; next to my sleeping diva-ette.  Oh the joys of living in a high-rise.      But as I drifted back to sleep, I did say a little prayer of thanks that it was only a false alarm, and that we were safe and warm in bed.  Sometimes it's good to be reminded of just how lucky you are.    Diva out.

       I finally have something to say about the war   March 26, 2003  Our Correspondent in Iraq  Christopher Allbritton, former AP and New York Daily News reporter, is about to become the Internet's first war correspondent. Allbritton has been collecting donations on his blog, Back To Iraq so that he can travel to Iraqi Kurdistan to report on Gulf War Redux and the occupation to follow. In about six months he has raised $10,318.21 and received donations of equipment from the likes of Panasonic and Iridium.  Chris is responsible to nobody but his readers. He will be filing stories from Iraq through e-mail. His articles will be delivered to "angel investors"  those who donated to his endeavour  first, and then posted to  urlLink Back To Iraq  for the masses to read. Chris' travels in Iraq will be directed by his readers. Those who have donated will be able to e-mail him and ask him to check out specific things. As long as it's reasonable, Chris will be happy to oblige.  Chris truly is the Internet's first very own correspondent. He isn't hemmed in by a news organization. He isn't beholden to advertisers. He isn't unduly influenced or handcuffed by the embedding process. He will be out there reporting for us, and responsible to no one but us. This is truly a significant moment in the development of the Internet and of "new media" journalism.   I urge you to check out Back To Iraq and, if you can, donate. Chris leaves for Istanbul tonight.   urlLink Posted by George Paine  From the "Gulf War Redux" Department as of 09:15 AM  Diva out.

       What are they thinking?  There are 2 new advertising campaigns out right now that, if nothing else, have at least caught my attention.    First of all, there's the new Guess? girl.  At least I think she's new.  I see her every morning on my way to work, on a bus stop ad.  Have you seen this?  She sort of looks like Claudia Schiffer, very Bridgette Bardot-ish; only she's more like the white-trash trailer park version.  I'm not sure what's going on with this one - maybe it's Claudia all washed out and used up?  Is she hard pressed for money or something?  I don't understand.  Maybe Guess? is trying to reach the low income denim wearers of America?  Then there's the new "Pork, the other white meat" campaign.  Which, now that I see these two together, sort of goes with the trailer park girl. But, I digress.  Familiar quotes and phrases have been twisted to serve pork's purpose.  There's "Go ahead, make my pork" and "Time flies when you're having pork".  It's clever I suppose.  Not really very creative, but catchy.    There's only one problem for me with this.  I have a friend with a very colorful vocabulary and he already uses pork as a replacement for another very colorful word.  You, uh, change the p-o-r to f-u-c and, well... you get the picture.  So, when I read "Time flies when you're having pork" I'm thinking, "Yeah. It sure does.  And I could use a little pork right now!" *blush*  Diva out.

       Quote for today  "Religions are different roads converging on the same point. What does it matter that we take different roads so long as we reach the same goal? I believe that all religions of the world are true more or less. I say "more or less" because I believe that everything the human hand touches, by reason of the very fact that human beings are imperfect, becomes imperfect."  -Mahatma Gandhi

       Monday, bah humbug!  If you were to take a look at the past entries for Mondays, you'll see that I am just not a Monday person.  And here we are again.  I had high hopes for another fabulous fun-filled weekend, but all I got was a weekend of being sick and hiding under covers on the sofa.    It started off well enough, with a trip to the salon on Friday afternoon.  Nothing better than an aromatherapy scalp massage and a hairwashing.  Ahh!  Walked out of there feeling all diva-licious, but by the time I got to my office, the humidity had wreaked havoc on my new 'do.  *sigh*  Friday night was lots of fun, with more alcohol than a Diva should consume in one night.  Didn't get out of the bar until 3:30... in the morning.  Sure, that's no big deal for you maybe, but for me... that's practically marathon partying.  I got to play pool, and danced a little and had a genuinely good time.  But I payed for it on Saturday.    That's when the cold that had been threatening to take over finally won.  In my weakened -- or is it weekend *grin* -- condition, the cold conquered all.  I sat motionless on my friend's sofa during a playdate with the little divas, then got into bed around 9pm on Saturday night.  Slept till 2:30pm on Sunday, moved to the sofa, and moved in and out of conciousness the whole day.  Missed my friend's wedding, too.   And today I would really prefer to be back on my sofa, under a blanket.  But, dedicated Diva that I am, I am at work.  I don't know for how long though.  Diva out.

        urlLink Happy Friday!   These questions are sort of thought-provoking.  Almost too much work on a Friday morning!  1. If you had the chance to meet someone you've never met, from the past or present, who would it be? I would like to say Albert Einstein, but I don't think we'd have much to talk about - everything he'd say would probably go right over my head.  Maybe Van Gogh would be good to talk to, or Marilyn Monroe.  I bet she'd be cool to hang out with and chat over a martini or two.  2. If you had to live in a different century, past or future, which would it be?  Hmmm... seems to me the more things change the more they stay the same.  I guess the turn of the 20th Century was an exciting time.  Roaring 20's, industrial revolution and all that jazz.  Yep, early 1900's please.  3. If you had to move anywhere else on Earth, where would it be?  I really love Miami, but if I had to move I would make sure it was someplace whiere it is always warm, never snows and is near the ocean.  Aruba maybe?  4. If you had to be a fictional character, who would it be?   If I had to be... wait, I already am a fictional character!    Ok, when I'm not the Diva, I'd be Cyrano de Bergerac  5. If you had to live with having someone else's face as your own for the rest of your life, whose would it be? I already look like everyone else.  I always get, "Aren't you so-and-so's sister?" or, "Didn't you used to work at blah blah incorporated?" and "Wow, you look just like what's-her-face famous-lady".  So, apparently I'm already wearing someone else's face.  Have a fabulous Friday everyone.  And in true Diva fashion, I am planning a big, fun-filled weekend again.  Meeting friends for 3-1 drinks tonight.  Yes, you read that right.  Three for One.  They don't call it Happy Hour for nothin'.   Saturday I will spend quality time with my little Diva-ettes and Sunday I'm attending a very informal wedding at the home of a friend.    Happy Friday!  Diva out.

       More blogging fun  This site tells you how many people in the UK have your name.   urlLink You're not me .  With my married name, a combination of American first name and Colombian last name, there are 0 in the UK that share my name.  According to the site, I don't exist.    With my maiden name, so very Irish, there are 72 in the UK.  So, I'm not alone after all.  And my parents weren't exactly creative when they came up with my slightly over-used moniker.  Diva reported 7.  I'm considering changing my name to Diva Darling.  Sort of like Holly Golightly.  It would look great on my driver's license, don't you think?  And just imagine my joy when someone asks my name.    Name please?    Diva Darling.    *nervous smile* Excuse me?     Diva Darling.    Ok... D-i-v-a D-a-r-l-i-n-g  I like it!

       Thanks  urlLink Fred    Just in case you are having a rough day, here's a stress management technique recommended in all the latest psychological texts    1.   Picture yourself near a stream.    2.   Birds are softly chirping in the cool mountain air.    3.   No one but you knows your secret place.    4.   You are in total seclusion from the hectic place called "the world."    5.   The soothing sound of a gentle waterfall fills the air with a cascade of serenity.    6.   The water is crystal clear.    7. You can easily see the face of the person you're holding underwater.

       Squeaky Clean  Going to the dentist is kind of like going to confession.  "Forgive me, Doctor.  It's been 6 months since my last cleaning.  Since then I have eaten candy, chewed gum and neglected to floss on a regular basis."  Then, he looks at you with that condescending my-teeth-are-better-than-yours Dentist glare, and says, "OK, let's take a look."    You leave after he gives instruction on how to redeem yourself for the next visit.  "Brush and floss every day.  Don't forget.  See you in 6 months."  My teeth are squeaky clean now, except that I had lunch just AFTER the cleaning.  Ah, forgive me.  Diva out.

       Happy Monday is an oxymoron  I'm here, and that's about as much as I can do today.    I did have a great weekend, even better than I expected.  Saturday I went to a Renaissance Fair with a friend.  She was feeling very generous, and insisted I pick out something.  I left with an Irish Cladaugh (spelling?) ring, which I have always wanted.  It was really very nice, and I'll have to go to more of those kinds of events.  Best of all, my friend had free tickets.  I love free.  Saturday night I went out with friends to the opening of a restaurant / lounge.  Very cool place, very chic with all of the "right" people.  The entire area was an open courtyard, with a huge tiki hut in the middle, serving as the main restaurant & bar.  Several little tikis covered booths along one side of the place, making for very intimate table settings.  Great music and free drinks with the night sky and full moon overhead.  I sipped champagne and danced my ass off and didn't get home until almost 3am.    Sunday I went to a movie with another friend, an advance screening of the new Chris Rock movie "Head of State".  Pretty funny with very subtle political satire blended in.  Chris Rock was there for Q&A afterwards.  My friend was in a great mood, the movie was good and Chris was funny.  It was a very entertaining evening.  And, in all, I spent about $3 the whole weekend.  I had to tip the bartender on Saturday night for all the free drinks.  This is how all of my weekends should be!  Fun-filled and free.  Did I mention all of this stuff was free?  I love free.  Diva out.

       Waxing Philosophical  And probably over-analyzing everything again.  However, the thought occurred to me that I don't exactly have the life I would have chosen if I could have chosen one.  Single mom, 2 kids, struggling to make ends meet and to make sense of this life experience.  If I wasn't such a coward, maybe I would just end this tour around the sun and start all over again.  But with my luck I'd come back as a beetle or a cockroach and be crushed in the first few days of my new existence.  Just desserts I'm sure.  But then, I realized that this IS the life I've chosen.  Each decision I've made in my life, no matter how wise or unwise, has formed this existence.  Deciding to have my first child at 23, instead of not having her, put me on this current path.  And sometimes the most inconsequential of acts can have the strongest effect on one's life.  Whether I decided for myself or allowed "fate" to decide for me, I still chose each step along the way.  I am who I have made myself to be.  So I truly am living the life I have chosen - like it or not.  As I get older, I am trying to pay more attention, to become more mindful of my decisions.  And, in all, I really do like who I am and what my life is.  While it could use a little upgrading in some respects (who couldn't do with a little improvement here and there), I really believe I am the best Diva that I can be.  Onward and upward with a mindful step.  And I won't be coming back as a cockroach!  Maybe a pampered French poodle?  Diva out.

       Happy Friday!    urlLink Friday Five  1. Do you like talking on the phone? Why or why not? Yes.  I especially enjoy talking to my children on the phone when they're away at their grandma's house.  2. Who is the last person you talked to on the phone? My youngest daughter, who was sick and stayed at grandma's house yesterday.  3. About how many telephones do you have at home? 1 phone - only my cell.  4. Have you encountered anyone who has really bad phone manners? What happened? 2 encounters.  1 was me, being rude and hanging up on someone.  I told her I had to go, had another line to answer, but she kept wanting to know when I was going to pay some bill.  I tried to be polite and end the conversation, but finally I just had to hang up her.  The other is a man who calls occasionally to speak to my boss at the office.  He asks for him, and before I can even answer that he's out of the office and can I assist him the guy hangs up!  So rude.  5. Would you rather pick up the phone and call someone or write them an e-mail or a letter? Why or why not?  Depends on the person.  I haev a few friends that I don't really want to talk to, as they draw out the conversation and babble on when I have no time.  So an e-mail is quicker.  Other friends I like to babble on with, so its ok to talk.   Sometimes it just depends on what time of day it is.  Looking forward to a fabulous weekend.  Have lots of plans, as a Diva should *wink* - taking my girls to a birthday party at a friend's house, which should be lots of fun - meeting a friend for drinks early evening on Saturday then meeting with even more friends for the opening of a restaurant & lounge with free drinks and great music.  The plan: to Eat, drink and be merry! - on Sunday I have a movie pass for a new movie that will be released soon.  Hope to take a friend.  So, I may have lots to tell you about on Monday, dear reader.  Stay tuned, and have a great weekend yourself!  Diva out.

      I wonder where my little weather tramp shops... she has a great wardrobe.  Mine needs work.  Black and gray dominate my closet, sprinked with white shirts and the occasional blue.  With all the tropical splendor surrounding me you'd think I could find more inspiration.  Pinks and blues, reds and yellows.  Nope.  Just straight-laced and conservative black and white.    Just your dazzling diva.  Must... shop... soon!  Diva out.

       Blah Tuesday  Finished reading Madame Bovary last night.  I think it must have been designed to warn young girls of living a frivolous life.  Young woman falls in love, marries.  Then realizes she's not really in love.  Miserable existence, falls in love with another young man.  Resists temptation, continues miserable existence.  Another man meets her, decides he will have her.  And he does.  They have an elicit affair, and she is blissfull for 2 years.  He leaves her, and she almost dies of grief.  Runs into the first young man, falls into an affair with him.  Husband knows nothing about it.   And all the while, she gets herself & husband so far in debt that the officials come to sell her stuff.   In her final moment of desperation, she asks her current lover for help in getting money, he can't.  She goes to her first lover for help, he won't.  Instead of repenting, telling her husband the truth and seeing the error of her ways, she decides to eat arsenic and kill herself.  Husband dies of grief at losing her, their little daughter is left penniless and orphaned.    Nice bedtime story, huh?  No wonder I'm feeling low today.    Diva out.

       Odds and Ends   I'm in a funk today, and feel like I'm not getting anywhere or getting anything done.  Maybe I'm just tired.  Reading "Madame Bovary", and its really depressing me.  Had 2 strange dreams last night and didn't sleep well in between dreams.    The best part of my weekend was my daughter's 10th birthday.  Nevermind the fact that I'm not old enough to have a 10 year old daughter, and I don't know how she grew so fast.  Anyway, she invited 8 of her little girl friends over - all 9 and 10 years old.  The usual sleepover party: pizza, junk food, ice cream and soda.  The sugar kicked in around 11pm and around 4:30AM I had to remind them to be quiet, since neighbors above and below were probably trying to sleep.  I did manage to sleep a little... I woke up around 6:30am and all was quiet.  They had finally run out of steam.  We had eggs, bacon, waffles and toast for breakfast at 9:30am.  Hit the pool by 10:30am.  By 2:30pm I was wondering when their mothers were going to get there to pick them up!  I think I aged 2 years this weekend, which makes me just about old enough for a 10 year old daughter.  It was fun, but  I won't be doing that again soon.  Diva out.

       There's just no talking to some people   I am not what you would call a religious person.  I tend to keep out of Christian conversations, since I prefer to accept and respect all religions and beliefs.  Whatever works for you, you know?  Well, me and my big mouth.  I recieved this:  (This was a forward worth passing along!)          There is a chance our country may be going to war very soon.  My son and I were talking about numbers the other night.  In scripture, the number 3 represents the Holy Trinity.  I thought of calling for a day of prayer for our country.  When you may ask?  March 3, 2003. It would be 03-03-03.     Wouldn't it be great if all the Christians in the world or at least in our country would stop what they are doing and pray on the same day. We could make 03-03-03 God's Day.  Faith is the doorway that all miracles come through, but prayer is the key that unlocks the door.      What about all stopping activity together at 03:03 in the afternoon?  Then it would be 03-03-03-03-03.  And that won't happen again for another thousand years (in 3003).     I'm marking my calendar for 03-03.   If each of you pass this on to your friends and family, and they in turn to theirs, we could have a powerful prayer time on that date.  Please do your part..   And after some thought, responded like this: Dear All,     I was forwarded this message by one who you forwarded it to.  However well meaning the thought behind the message, I would like to make a suggestion.  Imagine how much more powerful this prayer would be if instead of asking only for Christians to pray, but for all people of all religions to pray.  Belief in prayer makes the difference, no matter whether you are praying to God, El, Buddha, Jehova, Krishna or Mohammed.  Accepting the power of prayer should be more about accepting the power of those who pray, with love and acceptance.  Just a thought to consider on 03/03/03  a world of prayers instead of a Christian sect of prayers could make that much greater a difference.  A few days later, I got THIS:   Excuse me, I am not trying to be rude, but the things that you just said, however "well meant" are a complete and total lie, and I do not appreciate you forwarding your reply to the people on my list. You said that the power of prayer is "the power of those that pray" ????!!! O.K. I guess that the murderer that prays to Mohammed, or Allah, Or anyone else, that by the way is dead, buried, and DID NOT rise again, it's o.k. because they are sincere. O.K. and they will be just as sincere when they bomb our country with a nuke right??? You need to think next time before you type. There is only one true God and His name is in the BIBLE. He is the only one that will hear any prayers, and THAT is the truth. I will be praying for your salvation, so that you may spend eternity in Heaven with God. Please feel free to write back. I do not speak these things out of meanness. I truly want you to know the truth. And what you said is as far from the truth as you can get. No one's prayers will be heard if sent to the wrong "person" Just like if you send a package with no address it will be lost.    It never ceases to amaze me how incensed a "Christian" becomes when you suggest there may be other valid beliefs out there. *sigh*    Is there no hope for peace?  I respect the zeal behind the response, but ::Murderer praying to Mohhamed:: ??  Please, dear readers, give me some sign of hope here.  What's you're point of view on this?  I would enjoy hearing back on this.  By the way, my response to her:  Well,  it is always good to hear other points of view.  Thank you for sharing yours with me.   Peace-n-Love Diva out.

       Random Observation  Answered a call this morning, someone looking for someone else.  She was calling from a trade show and needed info on one of the attendees, who happens to work with me.  The acronym for the show is ITME.  Read aloud, you would probably say "it-me".  But, here in Miami we don't call an I an "eye", we call it an "eee".  So, what she said was, "I'm calling from eatme".  Excuse mi?  Diva out.

       Grrrrrrrr!  Ok.  The desire to hurt something has come back.  I have been desperately searching for one tiny, inconsequential little piece of paper that I knew I had handed off to someone at least 4 weeks ago.  He, in turn, handed it over to someone else for further processing.  Last week, I was asked about the status of that unimportant little piece of paper - since it was responsible for paying for the entire 4 day stay for a guest travelling from Europe, containing her credit card number, authorization for charges and approval from her bank!    NO ONE COULD FIND THE DAMN THING!  I asked again, please check again and again.  I really don't want to contact this guest and say, "Oh. Sorry. Yeah, we lost that.  Hope you don't start finding weird charges on your card.  If you do, we had nothing to do with it!"  So, I asked one more time.  And I asked someone else this time, because I wanted to look myself.  Before I had the chance to look myself, this wonderful person informs me that he found the authorization right where it was supposed to be.    SO WHY DIDN'T THE ONE WHO WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT DAMNED LITTLE SLIP OF PAPER KNOW WHERE IT WAS?  A week of fretting and worrying over nothing.   No wonder my eye is ticking along at a regular clip today.  Grrrrrrrrr!  Diva out.

       To Explain my I-Mood  I am not a violent person.  In fact the only person I've ever hit out of anger was my ex-husband, 2 days before I married him.  Should have taken that as a warning.  Anyway, this morning my eye is twitching (a newly developed stress-related twitch) and I am completely on edge.  The thought occurred to me this morning on the way to work that I understand how parents can beat their children.  Not that I condone it or would ever hit my children, but out of sheer exasperation and frustration, I see how it happens.    I wanted to tear wings off flies or kick a dog or something.  Wanted to yell at my children to hurry up and blast my car horn at every driver in my way while I sped down the highway at 70mph this morning.  Some horrible seed of anger has sprouted in me this morning and I don't know why.  And I don't feel sad or anxious.  Actually I feel pretty good today.  And now that I'm at work, I'm calmer.  The room is quiet, my coffee is good and the oatmeal is hot.  It seems to have passed, for now...  Diva out.

       Happy Monday  Having a great day.  Not sure why, but not going to question it.  Had a good weekend, saw the movie "Chicago".  As your very own Diva, I highly recommend it.  I want to go again and then buy it when it comes out on video/dvd just to see Queen Latifah's singing part again.  Oh, and that Murderess Row Tango (or something like that) "He had it comin'" has been running through my head ever since!  Had a drink with some friends Saturday night, then went running on the beach yesterday and got a little sunburned.  Nothing like falling asleep on the sand to totally relax you.  And, instead of a happy voice first thing in the morning, there was a phone call late last night.  Same friendly voice, this time to wish me a good night.  It was.  Diva out.

The Wine Club that I am allowed to perpetuate, just received the good word in one of the hottest and most chic glamour magazines in South Florida...  urlLink Ocean Drive  says,  "South Beach's most recognized gastronomical group, The Wine Club at The National Hotel hosts monthly tastings and decadent quarterly dinners held at in-house restaurant Tamara.  On May 29th Chef Greg McDaniel will dazzle members with a special five-course, five-rose-champagne matchup...."   I'm so excited - and my name is in  urlLink Ocean Drive ...

       Grrr.... grumble, grumble  Consider that your warning... and let the grumbling begin.  Last night some cretin, or more likely cretins, decided it would be lots of fun to throw empty beer bottles off the balcony.  From waaaaaaay up high.  At about 5:30 in the morning.  I didn't even know what the horrible glass-shattering was.  From under my pillow, it sounded like someone was bowling with beer bottles and getting strikes regularly.   I did finally get back to sleep for a little while, with an occassional score here and there interrupting my zzzz's.  When I got out of bed this morning, I went out onto my own terrace to see if I could find any trace of what exactly had happened.  I discovered on the rooftop two or three floors below me that someone had discarded three empty cases of beer.  So, what, that's like 36 beers?  And strewn across one section of the roof, probably directly below where ever they flew down from, were lots and lots of empty beer bottles.  Some were still entact, some were completely shattered.    Who, on a Tuesday night, can consume 36 beers?  And, why would anyone think it would be fun to toss them over the balcony at 5:30am?  Apparently, someone without work on Wednesday and without any consideration or common sense.    *Grrrrrr!  Diva out.

       Da-da-da!  Su-per Mom!  Regular readers may remember that I live in a high-rise.  30 floors of luxurious diva livin' high in the sky.  And with that luxurious living comes the elevator and all that comes with it.  I've never been too comfortable in these metallic sardine cans, but am always grateful for not having to climb 30 flights of stairs just to do my laundry.  Nonetheless, I worry about getting stuck in the elevator and have already been stuck once, by myself.  I am proud to say I didn't freak out when it finally happened.  But, you know, I never once considered the possibility that I could get stuck in the elevator  with my little divas .  It never once even remotely occurred to me that this could happen.  Never.  It happened.  Last night, while gliding up to our floor, that darling littlest diva - who has a real panache for button pushing - pushed the mail room floor, our floor, and then, just for kicks, pushed the button for another floor already below us.  Well, apparently she confused the hell out of that sardine can, because it didn't know which way to go.  Literally.  The doors closed after the mail room, then bounced.  Then moved up one floor, hesitated and bounced again.  I've experienced this before - ALONE.  And at first, I was upset with my littlest diva for playing with the buttons when I've told her before not to play with the buttons.  Oooh, I was steamed.  Until I looked at her gorgeous little face contorted with fear.  Not just the regular, scared-of-Santey-Claus-won't-sit-on-his-lap fear, no this was genuine, grade A, level one Fear.  The anger bounced out of me in that elevator and Super Mom, here to save the day, appeared.  Suddenly it occurred to me that this is scarey for me - an adult - and it was scarier for my girls.  I soothed and assured, and took charge of the elevator buttons.    The damn thing opened up on the wrong floor - one she hadn't even pushed - and we got out.  After calming everyone down and assuring them that it happens sometimes, it was nobody's fault and that it was okay to be scared, my other little diva (who is brilliant, by the way) suggested we walk to the end of the hall to the other set of elevators on the other end of the building.  So we did, and we went up to our floor in anxious silence, without further incident.  But I will never forget my daughter's face when that damn thing bounced.  She was absolutely terrified and close to panic.  I'm glad I was there, and I'm always amazed at how I am able to react to things when my girls are in need.  Their vulnerability and need somehow make me invincible - they make me Super Mom.     'Cuz, believe me, if I was by myself, I would NOT have been so brave.  Diva out.

       Happy Friday!  First of all, let me start by say I hate stupid people.  Ok.  with that said, I'll tell you about the Wine Club event last night.  No stupid people there, just lots of fabulous Italian wines being poured by fabulous Italian men.  I tried an Amarone, a Lugana and a Super Tuscan (these are wines, people).  I actually drank more wine at this event than at any previous one.  And the group of attendees were all wonderfully charming people.  The weather was clear and warm with a light breeze and the spread my Chef put out was beyond belief.  All in all, I had a great night, and so did everyone else who attended.  We ended up with 28 in attendance.  A great evening, and now I'm excited for next month's event.  Already started the planning on that one.  Have a great weekend everyone.  Diva out.

       Kvetchers Unite  Ever notice how some people love to complain?  Live to complain?  In fact, they get so good at it that they complain without even knowing that they're complaining.  If they're speaking, they're complaining.  Case in point, and what sparked this entry.  My coworker is a kvetcher.  She complains and you don't even realize that's what she's doing, unless you pay close attention.  She's sitting at her desk, eating her lunch.  I don't know about you, but on those occasions when I do eat lunch at my desk, I do not, under any circumstances, answer my phone.  I'm eating, for crying out loud.  But not her.  Oh, no.  She answers the ringing phone, thereby interrupting her meal.  Then she makes sure she mentions to the caller that "You caught me eating my lunch at my desk."  Then she tosses in a chuckle to lighten the comment.    That's how she does most of her complaining.  With a short chuckle at the end.   Its becoming annoying *chuckle*.  Diva out.

       Very Sad Diva News   Nina Simone, dies at age 70....  Please take a moment of silence for the legendary jazz great,Nina Simone. Pianist, jazz vocalist, revolutionary, a Lady with a powerful voice and soul, passed away at age 70 of natural causes in her home located in the South of France. That's the way to go.  Nina Simone lives on through her music, and profound political/social statements. She is regarded as the "High Priestess of Soul."  For the young generation who do that know of her tributes and references have been made to her in Mos Def's album, track # 10 "Rock & Roll", Black on Both Sides, and Talib Kweli's first solo ablum, Reflection Eternal, track # 20 "Expansion Outro". He did a remake of her famous song "Four Women."   For info, log on to her official  urlLink  website.    Rest in Peace Nina Simone.

       Wine Club Day!  It's the last Thursday of the month - Wine Club Day!  Can't wait.  Got a date with 10 Italians tonight... wines, people, 10 Italian wines.  And after fearing that no one would show up (as I always fear) I have 35 RSVPs for tonight and figure there will be a few who turn up without calling.  So, maybe a nice little group of about 45 guests.  It's going to be a great evening.  And, as for that gorgeous basket of goodies - I decided to leave it on my desk overnight.  Good decision, since now almost all of the cookies are gone, especially the toffee chip cookies I love so much.  Just a few chocolates and some macadamia nut cookies left.  Those toffee chip cookies were going to be the death of me - I ate 3 of them yesterday afternoon.  And we all know they go straight to the hips.  And, trust me, I don't need any more on my hips than I already have.  Did a good yoga practice last night to try and scare away any extra pounds I may have attracted with those cookies.  Hope it worked.  Diva out.

       Full Steam Ahead  Today I am in Wine Club mode and am really excited about the whole thing.  I had been losing interest in the whole thing, and even got the invitations for this month's event out way too late.  Still, there has been a good response, so I'm not worried.  But, now I'm eager to get next month's event planned - a member's only dinner with some really really good wines.  And I need to work on an event for June that will include water ballet in our 205 foot swimming pool.    So, I'm excited and rejuvenated and ready to go.  Diva out.

      well, I was feeling good.    Then, I had to hear (again) the story of why my colleague doesn't speak to the girlfriend of the man I divorced.  Yes, you know, DBD's bread and butter.  Hey, that's what I'll refer to her as from now on (when I absolutely must add her to this blog), in acroynm form, as typing all of that out takes a lot out of a girl.  So, from henceforth, she shall be known as B&B.  Now, on with our story.  I was reminded of the reason why he doesn't like B&B.  Apparently, B&B was invited to a wedding, when she really should not have been invited at all.  But office politics being what they are... my friend "bit the bullet" as he says, and invited B&B and DBD.  In the end, and after the final bill was rung up with 8 no shows, it turns out that DBD surprised his little B&B with a flight to the Bahamas for her birthday.  *Here's where that green-eyed monster rears up... he never took ME to the Bahamas.  Then again, I never paid his room and board either.*  So, he never spoke to her or DBD again after being so rudely slighted.  I just love hearing why people hate DBD... and B&B for that matter.  And I know I'm supposed to be over all of that, and I've moved on to much better people, places and things.  But, sometimes, that little monster comes back to gnaw on my insides just a little.  Grrr... money spent on her birthday present should have gone to pay for the welfare of our children instead.  I was living in his mother's bedroom while he was off galivanting around in the Bahamas.  Jerk.  Creep.  Worthless SOB DBD.  Ahhhhh... wow.  I feel better already.  Now if only my favorite IM'er would pop up to make my day complete.  Diva out.

       Feeling good  I know... its Monday.  But I feel good.  I have been on a cloud since last Thursday, but I'm not ready to share my details on all that just yet.   The weekend was good; productive and enjoyable.  I got up early (!) on Saturday morning, went to a (free) yoga class and then volunteered at the botanical garden here on Miami Beach.  The yoga was very beginners, but sometimes its good to go back to the beginning.  After more than 4 years of practicing Ashtanga, it was refreshing to be reminded of some of the rudimentary basics of yoga.    The garden project was wonderful.  I forgot my work gloves, so I was digging in the dirt with my bare hands, and there is always something energizing about getting dirt under your finger nails.  My group of about 5 or 6 people was assigned to plant new elephant ear plants in a garden bed.  We just sat on the ground, chatting and planting.  It was great, and I can't wait to go back next month.    Easter Sunday was spent at my mother-in-law's house with my two little divas.  And while the mere mention of mother-in-law sends others shrieking into another room, my mother-in-law is really my family and friend.  She spent the early afternoon alternating between hiding plastic eggs around her apartment for the girls to "hunt" and "hunting" for eggs that my little one hid for her to find.  I ate WAY too many jelly beans and York peppermint patties, resulting in a sugar headache that would have made even Candy Genius curl up in the fetal position.  Mmmmm, sugar coma!  But the weekend is done, and I'm back at my desk waiting to see what today brings me.  And looking for the return of an IM that I've been missing all week.  Have a fabulous day!

       DBD's World is about to be rocked!   Extra! Extra! New development in the child support (that is, the lack thereof) from the DBD!    While dropping the littlest diva off at her grandmother's house last night, I noticed an envelope lying in wait for the DBD (dead beat dad for you newcomers).  The only reason I noticed it was the sender's address - The State Attorney's Office.  My most favorite people, his least favorite.  I was so trying to figure out how I could swipe that letter without anyone noticing, then open it and reclose it, and finally replace it on the counter - without anyone noticing it.  I was without inspiration, so it remains, at this very moment, untouched on the counter.  *sigh*  However, I called the State Attorney's office this morning, under the guise of needing to update my address.  I moved in January, so I did really need to update them.  At the end of my call, I mentioned that taunting little envelope that I spied last night, and wondered if I would be getting a copy of whatever notice happened to be encased within.    No.  It went into my file, I was advised.  The notice was only sent to him, she told me, as the notice was a notice of delinquency.  Seems the courts don't like it when you don't play by their rules.  He has had about 6 months to come up with the last $1000 he owes the judge and has not paid up.  If he doesn't respond, a Contempt of Court will be filed against him.    In case you aren't aware, Contempt of Court IS NOT a good thing.  They can pick him up and haul him off to court and then jail.  I'm guessing that, while he was unable to cough up the grand to pay the judge, to benefit me and the girls, he will miraculously find a way to generate $1000 to get his ASS OUT OF JAIL!  So, this week ends on a delightful note of things to come.  It may take a while, but its coming... its coming.  Diva out.

      I'm convinced now that the "referrer" code doesn't really work very well.  Nevermind how long it took me to get the code to work (Candy remembers all to well I'm sure!).  It was tragic and problematic, to say the least.  And for what?!  The thing seems to arbitrarily spit up URLs that have no correlation to my page.  I've even gone and checked out a few of these so-called referrers.  There's no diva-like references, no mention of a diva in any way.  *sigh*  Just a terrible, contemptible tease that code.

       Who says you can't buy happiness?  Or at least victory.  My oldest diva-ette is now 10.  As a 10 year old, she gets an allowance.  Not a set amount, and not a great amount, but its all hers.  Her only chores, currently, are to take the trash to the trash chute (10 steps from our door) and to attend to her hamster.  I pay her a dollar for each time to takes out the trash, which generally tallies up to $5 a week (once a day during the week).  Sometimes she will offer to do a load of laundry for me or take the dishes out of the dishwasher, which ups the tally by $1 each chore.  I do not offer compensation for cleaning her room or picking up her stuff from around the house; i.e. socks, shoes, clothes, books, markers, dishes, candy wrappers, etc. etc.   I just request that she do it, and do it now.  Whereby, she never fails to say, "Ok, mommy"... and then never does any of it.  "Oh, I forgot" or "I didn't hear you" are her pat excuses for when I go into my rant about what she didn't do.  So, now I have a strategy to improve her memory and hearing.  Now, when she forgets or doesn't hear me, it  costs her  a dollar.  At this rate, based on her current earnings, she could owe me big, fast!  This could be the best 'get rich quick' scheme ever designed.    Well, at least it will save me a few dollars in allowance.  And trust me, that dollar is so much more dear to her than it is to me.  When I announced my new plan to my little darling diva, you would think I'd told her I was cutting off a finger for each offense.  She was horror-stricken at the thought of owing ME a dollar!  I've found my mark and hit it directly.    Nevermind restricting her from TV or video games or grounding her.  Nope, money is the center of her universe; well, actually spending it is what brings her joy.  Mostly on candy or the occasional trinket or toy.    Childrearing isn't so much about strict discipline, yelling, ranting, and so on.  You just have to find their "button".  Children have an inherent knowledge of each parent's button - find theirs and the world is yours!  Diva out.

       Sense of Achievement...  however trivial it may seem.  I've managed to read all of the blogs on my Blogroll today.  And get some work done, too.    And I'm seriously considering upgrading my blog to ProBlogger, just so I can start putting up pictures.  I'm feeling very inspired by all the photoblogs that are listed at the top of my Blogroll over there.  Just a few weeks more and I will have a bank account (that I can use) again, and with that comes the availability to shop/pay online.  I suppose I'll need that to pay for my spiffy upgraded blog.  So, there may be lots more to come in the weeks ahead... Maybe not.  But, don't stop visiting, just in case *wink*  Thanks for reading, as always.  Diva out.

       Weekend Update  I just got pics from the AIDS Walk on Sunday.  It was a great day for a walk.  The sun was shining and the air was cool; never broke a sweat.  Just strolled along very nicely and chatted the entire time. I'm going to put the link to the Snapfish album I created, in case anyone cares to see it.  It may or may not work.  Thank you to my readers who were kind enough to donate to the cause.  My team raised over $1000 for Care Resource and the event, on last tally, had raised over 75K in all, and still growing.   urlLink AIDS WALK Miami 2003   After that little 3 mile stroll I stopped at the Farmer's Market on Lincoln Road.  If you ever find yourself on Miami Beach on a Sunday, you really should check it out.  Fresh fruits and flowers, the best baked bread I've ever tasted, and lots and lots of art and antiques.  And with a Starbucks Coffee on practically every block, you'll have no shortage of caffeine to fuel your day.  Then, once I was home I decided to take another short walk - yes walk - over to the Museum and Library downtown.  I live about 3 blocks away, and as I said before, the weather was just perfect for walking.  Saw a very thought-provoking exhibit by Shirin Neshat on the roles of men and women in Islamic Iran.  Also picked up 2 new books to read:  Dickens and Shakespeare.  Finished off the day with a lovely nap on the sofa.    Just love those Sunday afternoon naps!  I couldn't live without them.  So, in all it was a very pleasant weekend.  Hope yours was just as nice.  Diva out.

        urlLink Top Ten Driving Tips for Miami    1.  Lane dividing lines and crosswalk markings are only suggestions and do not require to be followed explicitly.  Basically, no one pays any attention to these.  2.  Turning signals also fall under the category as Tip #1.  Either they don't get used at all, or the left signal will remain blinking for the next 20 miles.  As indicated above, basically, no one pays any attention to these.  3.  Yellow means "Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible."  4.  Red means "Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible before on-coming traffic gets there."  5.  Green sometimes means, "Let's wait and see what color comes next!"  6.  One way streets invariably will have some jerk driving down them the other way, while blaring his horn and blaming you for paying attention to the street signs and dividing lines. *See tip #1*  7.  While travelling south in the far right lane, the car ahead of you suddenly decides to make a left U-turn (no signal required), across two lanes of southbound traffic. Then, defying on-coming northbound traffic, the driver travels across those "suggested" lane dividers to the farthest northbound lane.  What should you do as he arbitrarily travels across 4 lanes of moving traffic?   Answer:  Nothing.   Just keep driving; slight amazement at this everyday act is allowed, but not required.  8.  Never expect anyone to ever stop at a stop sign or to yield the right of way.  Ever.  9.  When driving late at night, all rules are off.  Traffic lights are often shut down after 10pm (especially in my neighborhood) to promote "safety" in the streets.  Generally, this means that red, yellow and green all mean the same thing: "Get your ass through the intersection as quickly as possible." *Note: this tip is only slightly different from our previous tip on red lights.  This is because there is generally not any on-coming traffic in the 'hood at 10pm.  The occasional slow-moving pimp-mobile or cop car, but not much else.*  10. When the bum on the corner offers to clean your windshield for a dollar, save him the effort and just give him the dollar.  You have NO IDEA what could be in that bottle of liquid, and you probably don't want it on your car!  Diva out.

       Gifts of the internet  I received an email from my sister this morning.    "A friend of mine wrote this but doesn't think it's any good and she thinks my opinion is biased cause we're friends so I asked if she minded if I sent it to you. Let me know what you think of it please! Love you!!!!"     No trust Deep pain Great Fear No Gain   I'm scarred I'm scared My past left me impaired   How to know she tells the truth I inch forward very slow I want to believe that she'll be there But how am I to know   I listen close to every word Does she have some secret plan But when I look into her eyes She reaches out her hand                           ~Anonymous   I'm going to write her back and tell her I like it.  But, I was so touched by the sentiment, the fear that so many of us experience but aren't able to put into words, that I felt impelled to share it.  Hope the writer doesn't mind.  What do you think of it?  Oh, and don't forget to check your Monday morning horoscope over at Frenchy's blog.  I'm going there now.  Diva out.

       Never Never Land  I've been subjected to watching Peter Pan twice a day, every day this week.  No, its not some strange and unusual form of punishment; my littlest diva is obsessed with the movie this week.  You know how little kids get, they need to watch the same thing over and over again until they know all the words and all the scary parts lose their scariness.  And we're not talking the Disney animated version here --oh no.  This is the 1950's(?) NBC televised live performance with Mary Martin.  It's quite good and very entertaining.  The songs stick in your head for days - you can trust me on this one.  But, after about the 4th or 5th time, my grown-up cynicism reared its ugly head and I started to see Peter Pan in a whole new light.  Actually, I started to see a few of the men that I've either dated or married personified in Mary Martin's character. *ugh!*  "I won't grow up!" "I want to stay a boy forever!" "He wants me to always do his spring-cleaning!" "Can you tell stories, and tuck me in at night, and mend my pockets?"  Typical; the girl asks "What are your exact feelings for me?"  How many times have we said that, ladies?!  At least he responds honestly, in all his boyish charm,"That of a devoted son for his mother."  And then, at the end, Wendy's grown too old for Peter, so he invites the younger Jane to fly away with him instead.  It's all just a classic bed-time story after all, but under the glaring eyes of adulthood, its all a little too real.  Tonight, I think we'll have to pick some other movie to watch.  Unfortunately, if its another childhood fairy tale, I'm sure I'll find some fatal flaw in whatever we select.  Diva out.

       While we're on the subject of Co-workers  I have another co-worker who came into the office the other day with a big plastic bag filled with clothes.  When asked, he informed me that he had just come from the thrift shop.  His partner did a little spring cleaning, and donated a bunch of things to a local charity thrift store.    Only, he didn't ask what was ready to go.  So, my friend had to go to the thrift store and BUY BACK his own clothes.  Seems he still wears most of what his partner donated.    Oops. *grin*  Diva out.

       Feeling Lucky   There's been a lot of noise lately about America and Americans and the American Way.  Well, my friends, all I have to say is I feel really freakin' lucky to be American right now.  I work with a woman from Peru who has been in the US for several years under Political Asylum.  All of a sudden, Peru isn't considered a dangerous country, and Political Asylum just doesn't fly anymore.  So, she and her husband have been told that their work visas are no longer valid, effective immediately.  She and her husband have 60 days to "find a new country."  Basically, we don't care where you go, but you can't stay here.  She lives here, works here, goes to college here.  Or, at least she used to.  Diva out.

       And now for today's real entry  What I really wanted to talk about today is my newest hobby.    I bought a bottle of Woolite over the weekend.  I'd been wanting to buy some, but haven't been able to find it in my grocery store.  It wasn't with the laundry detergents or the household cleaners, so I figured they just didn't carry it (heathens!).  I found it in some other aisle, near dishwasher detergents I think.  Or maybe it was with the bar soaps.  Once I found the elusive concoction, I had to decide on the big bottle or the little bottle.  I opted for the little one, but am beginning to realize my mistake.  Should've gone for the Jumbo bottle.  Now that I have acquired this magic elixir, I have been Wooliting everything I can get my hands on.  I've hand washed the cushions on my sofa, a dry clean only skirt and one of my favorite suits.  This particular suit is about 4 years old and while it does still look great, I just don't have much faith in dry cleaning.  After 4 years of dry cleaning, I felt the suit should see a little water - at least once in its lifetime.  Needless to say, the jacket is still drying - the bottle instructed me to "lay flat to dry".   Still drying.  But now, I'm looking around the house, wondering what else I can Woolite.  Decorative pillows and bath rugs beckon.  I may even put a little in the baby's bath water tonight.  And then instruct her to "lay flat to dry."  May be the most peace and quiet I've had in days.  Diva out.

       Miscellaneous Observations  First of all, many thanks to my readers who have made a donation for the AIDS Walk this Sunday.  I'm walking a little over 3 miles and have raised more than my goal of $100.  And for the first time in doing this sort of thing, I think that's pretty darn good!  If you feel the need to do some good, there's still time to  urlLink Support Your Diva!    Observation:  None of my most intimate male friends *wink wink* have made any donations.  As always, the most supportive males in my life are not the ones I have, um... 'relations' with.   Why is that?      As far as I can tell, they don't even read my blog.  Wouldn't you think it would be a good idea to read?  Hmmph.   Observation:  I've come to the realization that I am very content just the way things are.  Well, money is still an issue, but I'm not lonely or in need of male companionship.  For a while there I was thinking "Poor Diva.  All alone in the world without a man to call her own."  BAH!  Over that! I curled up in my big queen-size bed last night, snuggled up to my huggie pillow and felt very content as I drifted off to sleep.  It was a very good feeling.  Of course now that I'm happiest without a man, they'll all start crawling out of the woodwork again.  That's pretty much how that works.  They just can't stand to see you happy!    Observation:  I read on a blog the other day, I think it was on "Was it the Pagan Remark?" about a little man bashing.  Just a little.  Nevermind how very strongly I agreed with just about all of it.  I started having thoughts of my own.   * Younger men who like older woman haven't had any of the experiences yet always think they know everything. * I'm tired of men who need coddling.  These men either always have an excuse for why they didn't or couldn't do what they were supposed to do, poor babies.  In the meantime, I'm getting it done.  No excuses.  Make it happen.  But they just can't.  And there seem to be more than a few men like this around me.  It's becoming annoying.   Observation:  I've been so concerned about treating my youngest diva with nuturing love, as a baby that I've sort of overlooked my oldest little diva.  I've always had a tendency to treat her more like an adult than a child, and lately I'm seeing that she needs a little more nuturing.  She's growing up; maybe that's why I'm noticing.    Ok.  Observations over for now.  I feel like I should say something very wise and philosophical right now, but all I can think of is, "I need another cup of coffee."   Hmm... go thee out and seek thy coffee.   There.  Wise and philosophical.  Diva out.

       Back at work  I had a whole 3 days off.  I didn't abandon my little blog or my lovely readers, I just wasn't around to update.  I've been really sick and finally decided to take a day off and go to the doctor.  And now, with a little extra rest and some antibiotics, all is well in the world of the Diva.  And, among the 183 e-mails this morning, this one was my favorite.  Subject:  The copy machine is heartbroken...  The copy machine did not make it over the weekend without hearing from you. Could you please come and see it.   The sad part is, this is the most romantic message I've received in MONTHS. *sigh*  And even sadder, I couldn't fix the machine this morning... not even my touch was enough to make it all better.  Had to call in the repair man. *another sigh*  Diva out.

         urlLink      I'm completely down-to-earth!   urlLink  Find your soul type  at  urlLink kelly.moranweb.com .    You are the most in touch with knowledge. It's the tree of life from which you tap the sap. You know what you want and you know how to reasonably get it.  Virtues: You respect people with plans. When someone has their head on their shoulders, you know that they can see straightforward and keep their eyes on the mark. When it comes to looking at the future, you take a logical approach: what's within your ability? A fortunate attribute that you have is the ability to set a goal for yourself, higher than maybe you feel possible, but still keep yourself within reasonable bounds. You take the time to appreciate those surrounding you and they do appreciate you in return. Decision-making comes naturally to you when you take the time to consider each option. People only come to talk to you when they are looking for a logical, reasonable solution.  Aspirations: You have an idea of what you can do with your life, but you push it up a notch. You need a profession that you can enjoy, so work towards it. You want to live near your friends and family while being as far away as possible. You also want to settle down while working in excitement and variation.  Quirks: You don't appreciate drama queens and they don't appreciate you. When they need help, they won't seek you out because of your ability to see through their overly dramatic predicaments. You have leeway for humor, and sometimes love to participate in it, but when it becomes irrational behavior, others can count you out. Loud noises are bothersome, except when they come from you or your friends.  Factors: Reach for the sky! Don't decide to do something because you're merely good at it, but choose something you might like to do, despite whether you're sure you can master it or not. Don't only save room for a few empathetic friends, but open up to everyone.  Future: When looking for a job, if you work in all of your talents (logic, decision-making, planning, and definitely humor), you'll find yourself happy. Come to a compromise for location; live nearby your friends and take periodic vacations or live farther away and take frequent return trips.  * * *  I don't think this is me.  I'm a little more "by the seat of my pants" than this... and planning?  Ha!  Oh well.  So much for tests.  Diva out.

       Friday!  So much to say and do.    Let's see, first of all... last night's dinner was fabulous.  The seared scallop paired with the Carneros Cuvee 1991 was amazing, and the Oddysey paired with the Veal and Truffle jus... divine.  It was an amazing dinner, and quite an enjoyable evening all together.   Having the French Ambassador's party dining just a few feet away added to the fab-ness of the evening.  (No, really ~ the French Ambassador was there!)  This weekend is busy.  Going to the salon tomorrow to get my brows shaped; want to look my best for the Big Apple.  And I'm going to a Kabbalah course - on interpreting dreams on Sunday.  Meeting a friend for brunch on the north of the beach, and then going together to this course.  If nothing else, it should be interesting if not enlightening.  And at some point I have to take my two little divas to the see the newest Disney animated film, "Finding Nemo".   I've  They've been looking forward to this film for months!    Have a fabulous day, dear reader.   And an even better weekend!   And now, for the  urlLink Friday Five   1. What do you most want to be remembered for? ~ My ridiculously, shall we stay retarded, unrealistic optimism?  2. What quotation best fits your outlook on life? ~ "There's more than one way to do everything."  If I can't figure out a way to get what I want or need, I try looking at it from a different angle; there's always a way.  Or, "To thine own self be true."  3. What single achievement are you most proud of in the past year? ~ Getting a grip on my budget while still managing to keep a roof over my head, and the heads of my little divas.   4. What about the past ten years?   Bringing my girls into the world, and watching them grow.  They truly are my pride and joy.   After reading that, I reconsidered.  My girls aren't an achievement, more of a blessing.  Acheivements from the past 10 years would be learning to love unconditionally, learning to be strong and stand up for myself, learning how to take care of myself and to love myself unconditionally.   5. If you were asked to give a child a single piece of advice to guide them through life, what would you say?  ~ "Nevermind what people say.  Believe what you know in your own heart to be true."  I've had to say that more than once to my girls lately.    Diva out.

       A toast to optimism... I'll drink to that!  The internet is e x c r u t i a t i n g l y  s l o w  today.  It takes forever for a page to open, so that by the time it does open, I've forgotten why I was going there in the first place.   *bleh*  It's rainy and gray outside again.  Just another day in paradise... NOT!  And, to complete my day, I have the Wine Club Dinner tonight.  The first dinner I've done since last November, which was a great success with 100 guests.  That dinner benefitted the Boys & Girls Club of South Florida.  Tonight's dinner doesn't benefit anyone, not even me considering there are only 14 guests expected.  That's including me, the Wine rep and his guest.  *bleh again*  But, still, it should be a good night - if we don't get rained out.  14 people sitting at one great big table, conversing over glasses of Gloria Ferrer Chardonnay and Carneros Cuvee 1991, whilst nibbling on Roast Capon and Veal Medallions.  Tres yummy.  And the Wine rep will be giving out goodie bags and bottles of wine to take home.  Since there are so few attending, he can do this little extra something special.  So, more is not always better.  And, as always, I am trying to be optimistic and sunny in the face of adversity.  Besides, there's nothing a little good vino can't cure!  Diva out.

       Mun-day...   Uh, no.  It's Tuesday.  Just feels like Monday.  Well, I know that as a Diva I have certain obligations.  It is my responsibility to live the glamourous life, life on the edge, yadda yadda, etc etc.  Sorry to have to let you down.  This weekend I was less Diva and more what Roseann Barr calls a "domestic goddess".  Yep, scrubbing toilets and folding laundry.  I did go downtown for a little window-shopping, tried on a fabulous red dress, which I intend to go back next weekend and claim for my own.  I've lost 5lbs. and this dress is exactly what I need to show off my slightly trimmed physique.  Any excuse to shop ;)   Other than that, the most exciting thing to happen to me was that my blog got a  urlLink comment  from  urlLink the Doc  who is currently in India.  And, apparently having about as much fun as I did this weekend.  But this current domesticity won't last for long.  I'm gearing up for a fabulous weekend in New York, June 6 to 9.  Can't wait.  As the details unfold I will be sure to share them with you, dear reader.  After all, I have obligations to fulfill.  Diva out.

       Happy Friday!   Memorial Day Weekend is here, and on South Beach that means a new kind of chaos.  Locals know to stay away, and even certain upscale parties have learned this very important lesson.  At least one of the weekend's parties has moved to downtown Miami, opting out on South Beach.  And, believe me, despite the controversy and all the talk, it has more to do with the mass quantity of people than it has to do with what kind of people are here.  We're talking gridlock, crowding, road rage... and that's on the sidewalks!  Wall to wall people strolling up and down Collins Avenue.  Driving two blocks takes 15 minutes ~ no really.  Although, this year may not be as crowded.  Several hotels are still not sold out.  And while the city hopes the crowds won't come en masse, the hotels, restaurants, clubs and shops hope they will come.  This is the last big weekend of high season for Miami ~ when we make our money ~ and we all need to make budget for May.  We count on this weekend to make budget.  If we don't do it this weekend, we just won't do it.  So, for the next three days ALL police officers are on 12 hour shifts, the "God Squad" walks the streets 24/7, all hotel managers are living on property, bars are stocked, streets are cleaned, staff are braced.    Bring it on!  Have a great holiday weekend, everyone.  Diva out.

       Terrorist Attack?  Or public service?  After all,  urlLink the explosion  went off just as law students were completing their final exams.  Maybe someone was just trying to prevent a new onslaught of even more lawyers.  (heh heh)  On a personal note, I'm having a very weird "doom and gloom" feeling lately.  I feel like I may finally be very very close to a great happiness, a lifelong joy.  And now I feel like I'm not going to live long enough to receive it.  Yesterday I was caught walking between two city busses, ** Eliz, your comments yesterday regarding busses came to mind at that moment - very weird**.  I almost got side-swiped while driving home, tripped several times while walking (that's nothing new actually) and my daughters were freaking me out by running and jumping into the deep end of the pool.  It was too much, I had to get upstairs into my safe little home and cocoon myself there.  Today, there was an accident a few cars ahead of me, so I just missed that one.  Its just that I really feel like I'm finally making really good decisions in my life, walking on the right path, and my trip to NY will take me further along that path and closer to a really good man.  So now I'm afraid I'm never going to make it to NY.   And today we're on high alert.  I get on a plane in 15 days, and we're on high alert.  Isn't that special?  *sigh*  Diva out.

       There may be hope yet...  If a  urlLink leopard and a cow can live together in peace , there's hope for us all!  And thank goodness the mercury retrograde is over.  This was one of the strongest retrogrades I have ever experienced.  And, unfortunately, with the full moon and the eclipse thrown in, it wreaked havoc like a molatav cocktail for some people.  Since the full moon I've heard several stories of tragedy, and I had a near miss myself - just a little bumper bump yesterday.  No big deal, but Advil will be my new best friend today.  Always by my side.  *oy, my aching back*  Diva out.

       Received this today, and thought if you're in the Miami area, maybe you'd like to check it out.   To all my single female friends!!!   Vince from Pre-dating and I are working on having event @ the National Hotel by the  end of June beginning of July.  I need to find out who would be interested in participating so Vince and I can determine a specific category for that event, ex. (Singles without  children, Athletic Singles, Latin Singles, Latin Women & Gringos and an age category along with it).       I tried it and it was a lot of fun! Log on to  urlLink Pre-Dating  for more information. Please  urlLink e-mail me .  The sooner I get your response the sooner we can start planning.    Hope to hear from you soon!

      ok.  first of all, did you know that if you hit the escape key by mistake while typing your post, your entire entry dissapears?  Guess how I know.  Now for today's entry.   Happy Monday Everybody!   Yes, I am uncharacteristically happy today, and it has everything to do with my weekend.  A friend that I haven't really seen in maybe 4 or 5 years came to Miami for the weekend.  She and her roommate kept me so busy with fun that I hardly had time to sleep.  It was such a great weekend, its amazing what a few good friends and a little dancing can do for a girl.  Friday night we attended the Ocean Drive May Issue Launch Party at a very trendy and chic South Beach hotel ~ I was in this month's issue so it was only right that I attend ;)  Then, on Saturday night I got a few more old friends together and had a group of 4 of us together for the first time in 7 years.  The last picture in my  urlLink gallery  shows you just how good it was to be together.  And, just one more reason for my current state of ecstasy... I bought a ticket to New York on Saturday.  This is a very long overdue trip, and will be a sort of mini-vacation for me.  Can't wait, and I'll probably put up some sort of countdown if I can find some free countdown online to help with that.    Hope you had a great weekend, too, dear reader.  Of course, it couldn't possibly have been nearly as fabulous as mine, because after all, you're not the Diva, I am ;)  Diva out!

       Gifts received  I had the amazing experience of watching the lunar eclipse last night.  I raised a glass to toast the great goddess before her face was hidden in the earth's shadow.  I sat for about 35 minutes on my terrace with an awesome view of the whole celestial event.  Even got my opera glasses out to get a better view.  I had to wait 33 years to see my first lunar eclipse, and it was worth it.  I also had an interesting thought this morning, while waiting for the rain to pass so I could walk the two blocks from the parking lot to my office.  I forgot my umbrella at home.  I realized two things; first of all, I remembered that old addage, "Into every life a little rain must fall".  Believe me, its been falling for about 2 years now ~ but then I was reminded that, it doesn't fall forever.  The rain passes soon, and life goes on.  The other thing that came to me is this: While you don't have to be prepared for everything that life throws your way, you may have to be prepared to wait until it passes.  Happy Friday everyone.    Diva out.   and one more thing... I recently heard that China is considering passing a law that if you are considered to be spreading SARS to others  by going outside when sick, you will be executed.  Not confined, not quarantined, EXECUTED.  Sounds ridiculous, must be propaganda, right?  Check this out ~  urlLink This is scary.

       Death by Oreo   I almost hesitate to think that this could be real, but according to  urlLink this  and  urlLink this , its true.  Oreos could be banned, or have a health warning label placed on.  Like cigarettes and alcohol.  "Hey, you got ID for those, kid?"    It could become the newest option on death row.  Injection, gas, or Oreo?  I choose death by Oreo!  Diva out.

       Random Thoughts   Good to Remember:  Work harder. Worry more. Experience additional difficulty. Disagree with people. Feel fed up. Do you think you can manage at least some of the above? Its funny isnt it? We dont need to be told to do this kind of thing. We live in a world that more or less forces it all to happen. Yet we also live in a world that is full of grace, beauty and magic. Our lives are blessings. Our moments are gifts. Our futures are not destined to be full of drudgery. We can experience great joy and contentment at times.  Heard in the office today: "I don't want to freak you out, but Mike Tyson is eating the garnish off your banquet table on the terrace."  Otherwise, just another normal, quiet and uneventful Tuesday.

       Monday  Feeling pretty good, for no good reason.  Had a decent weekend; went downtown to Miami Art Museum and the Main Library on Saturday with my kids.  It was family day at the Museum, which means free entry for families and activities for the children.  It was a good day in all.    Saturday was also the May Day project.  It started bad and ended bad.  My camera eats batteries at a ridiculous rate.  I was able to click off 6 pictures when the newly bought batteries gave out.  I was short on cash, so was unable to get more batteries.  You can see my pathetic attempt at my  urlLink May 10th Gallery .    I'll try to be better prepared for the next project.  Sunday was uneventful.  Picked up the little divas from their grandma's house; they had roses and a card for me.  It's just always nice to pick them up after being at grandma's all weekend (every weekend).   They're so happy to see me after two days away.  I sometimes wonder if I'd ever get such a warm welcome otherwise.  Off to get more coffee, with thoughts of New York in my head... will be travelling north soon.  More on that later.  Diva out.

        urlLink Happy Friday Everyone!    1. Would you consider yourself an organized person? Why or why not?  ~~ Relatively organized.  I live by the rule: A place for everything, and everything in its place.  2. Do you keep some type of planner, organizer, calendar, etc. with you, and do you use it regularly?  ~~ I do have an organizer, and update it whenever something new (bill, event, etc) comes up.  3. Would you say that your desk is organized right now?  ~~ Hmmm... orderly disorder would best describe it.  4. Do you alphabetize CDs, books, and DVDs, or does it not matter?  ~~ No - can't be bothered.  I'm not anal or anything!  5. What's the hardest thing you've ever had to organize?  ~~ My life after my divorce!  Weekend plans are beginning to form.  Last weekend I walked 4 miles across a causeway connecting Miami to Miami Beach.  Very peaceful walk, and I plan to do it again this weekend.  Also want to check out a new Wine & Champagne Bar that just opened up on the beach.  I'll let you know how it all turns out ~ Have a great weekend!  One other thought before I go... someone commented this morning on how quickly the days are flying by.  We're already to the middle of May!  But then I considered this: time does fly, and before you know it this year will be over, and so will the next ten that follow this one.  That is why we must make every day count for something.  Otherwise, just let them fly by.  If you can't be bothered to make this one count, why should you care about the next one?    Diva out.

Or are you just starting to get very, very tired? Jupiters rare opposition to Mars implies a time of turmoil. You feel as if you are caught up in a drama that you cant control. It is bigger than you. And somehow, you have to play your part as best you can, regardless of what this takes out of you. Thats how you feel  but is it true? Must you really worry as much, try as hard and dedicate so much energy? Life is about to get an awful lot easier and lighter."  I hope so, I really hope so.   Diva out.

       Not a family bed!  I don't know how they do it.  I'm friends with a married couple that do that whole "family bed" thing.  You know, the WHOLE family shares one great big bed.  Mom, Dad and all the kids cozied up together.  Well, I am definitely not one of those people, and I certainly do not have a great big bed.  Unfortunately, my children do not understand this.  I've gotten used to the 4 year old climbing into my queen-size bed with me maybe 3 nights out of the week.   But last night, my 10 year old daughter crawled into bed with me around 2am.  I was like "Uh-uh! what do you think you're doing?!"  She had a bad dream and I reluctanly gave in with a sigh.  But then, about an hour later the other one crept in as well.  So there I was, sandwiched between the two of them.  Do you have any idea how wild a child sleeps???   Hands flopping everywhere (mostly across me), legs kicking (mostly my legs) and hair falling where it may (mostly on my face!).    When the alarm sounded at 7am, I said in my cheeriest morning voice, "That's it.  Everybody out!  Get up!"    After yesterday's sleepless night, this was just one more sleepless night.  I may have to learn how to function on 4 or 5 hours of sleep at a time.  Oh, how I need a nap! For now, I'm off to get another coca-cola...  Diva out.

       MoNdAy  And, of course, I'm feeling out of sorts.  My littlest diva turned 4 yesterday, and MIL threw a nice "little" party for her.  We ended up moving the party to the park, since we were expecting 21 adults with their children.  And this is just her immediate family!  Gotta' love those tight-knit Latin families.    Had the excrutiatingly unpleasant experience of sharing the party with DBD and B&B.  Yes, he brought her to the party, after all she pays for everything he does and has, so she may as well come along.  I was very surprised at how soothing chanting can be.  "OM" helped me through the day, and eventually I just forgot about her and had a great time anyway.  I would like to think that my apparent ease and comfort at the party really bugged her.  I still have some work to do on digging out my little anger seed in regards to those two.  I didn't sleep well last night, but it had nothing to do with that.  The party exhausted me - it really was a fun day - and so I should have been able to sleep.  I was doing pretty good until 4am when something shattered downstairs.  Sounded like a plate-glass window was completely shattered.  The noise startled me out of a pretty good sleep, and then the train passed by, and soon every little bump, shuffle, and sigh kept me awake.   Around 5:30 I considered getting out of bed, but decided to give it another try.  I was really close to sleep when the train passed again - it does so every half hour starting at 4:30am.  I did finally get back to sleep, just in time to get up.    I almost cried this morning when I heard on the radio that the Metrorail will begin 24-hour service in June.  Diva out.

       After such a nice evening  Then there are those nights when I wonder how I'll ever survive motherhood.  But, those nights are few and far between... good thing for those little diva-ettes. ;)  Happy  urlLink Friday  everyone!  1.

Name three songs that turn you on. ~ "Can't Get Enough of Your Love" by Barry White, "Throb" by Janet Jackson, and "I Need You Tonight/You're One of My Kind" by INXS 4. Name four songs that always make you feel good. ~ "Groove is in the Heart" by D'Lite, "Brick House" (I don't know who its by), "I Feel Good" by James Brown, and "Stand by Me" (again, don't know by whom)  5. Name five songs you couldn't ever do without. ~ Probably the first five songs from Sade's Love Deluxe CD, since that's what I play to put the littlest diva to sleep every night!

       Random Thoughts and Simple Joys  Why is that, when I was in my twenties I could eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's every day, and managed to weigh about 20 lbs less than I do now.  There's no Ben & Jerry's in my diet now, shouldn't I be magically rewarded for NOT indulging?  Hmmm... maybe I should go back to my old habits... maybe not.  Last night I was rewarded with a few simple joys - the ones in life that really count.    First, while rocking the littlest diva off to sleep last night she was fighting sleep with all she had in her.  But, of course, Mr. Sandman won in the end.  But, during her valiant fight, I watched as her eyes fought to stay open... her eyelids fluttered shut and then opened wide, just to fall half-closed again.  That simple flutter gave me such joy that a laugh started way down in my heart and rose up in my throat.  Before I could help myself I laughed out loud and woke her up a little.    Then, after putting her into her little bed, I sat down next to my older diva-ette for our bedtime chat.  She was updating her calendar planner that I gave her for Christmas.  I noticed a picture of Teddy Roosevelt on the bottom corner of a page, and asked her if she knew who he was.  She hesitated, so I tried to give her a clue by asking if she knew what his job had been.  Her lips sealed up tight, and then she said, "Yes".  That was it, just "Yes." with this sly little grin.  We both knew she had no idea, and that shared knowledge made me laugh.  "Liar!" I teased and tickled her.  Filled her in on the minor details, thinking that someday she'll learn more about President Theodore Roosevelt and, hopefully, remember our little exchange.  Those are things to be treasured... the flutter of an eyelid, a sly little smirk, a shared secret.  That's what makes my life so cherished... good thing I'm such a simple girl.  With all my troubles and worries that I have, I'm still one of the richest people I know.  Diva out.

       Friday!  Maybe it's the longer daylight hours, but this week has been so  l o n g.  It's finally friday. woo-hoo.    I thought my world-traveler diva-ette was coming home on sunday, turns out she won't be back until tuesday.  i was kind of bummed when i found out last night.   here's something i don't understand.  even after reading it 10 times at least, why do i always cry after reading the last act of cyrano de bergerac?  i know how it ends.  but i still cry every time.  and before i go... it's not friday without  urlLink Friday Five    1. How are you planning to spend the summer?  ~  Road Trip! 2 weeks in a rental car with my adorable children in the backseat.  a visit to the  urlLink Gerbilman Ranch , then to mom & dad's in the Tennessee mountains, then on to Savannah and finally Disney World.  I may even fit another trip to NY into this summer.  Will take lots of pictures.  2. What was your first summer job? ~ my first summer job was babysitting when I was maybe 13 or 14.  after that i stayed away from all forms of childcare until i had my own child to care for.  3. If you could go anywhere this summer, where would you go?  ~ anywhere that i could take a nap in a hammock  4. What was your worst vacation ever? ~  a trip to orlando with the whole family - we're talking like 14 people.  ever tried keeping 14 people together and happy?  it wasn't much fun.  5. What was your best vacation ever? ~ so far, the best was my most recent trip to NY.  i'm thinking the road trip may push it's way up to number 1 though.  okay.  happy weekend to all.  diva out.

       Wise words  First of all, let me say that I totally dig the new blogger look.  It will be interesting to see how many bugs are included with the new look.  Now, for those wise words.  And from an unlikely source.  There's this song on Radio Disney, I think by Hilary Duff (all parents reading this right now know EXACTLY who and what song).  This very young and not-very-world-weary child sings this wisdom into my ear at least twice a day, and I can't help but wonder who actually wrote it.  "Why not take a crazy chance?... If you miss a moment, you might lose alot; so why not?"  Pretty much describes my whole outlook on life.  But then, I'm more upbeat and carefree than most grown-ups I know ;)  Diva out.

       Ouch!  Still on the theme of sainthood, I think I earned my wings the other night.  After having been outside for about 45 minutes and playing with a few neighbor kids, I politely informed my littlest diva that it was time to go inside.  8:15, time to get cleaned up and ready for bed.  She, being the wonderful and adorable child that she is, immediately turned into a wild, screaming and scratching beast in protest to my unreasonable demand.  I ended up carrying her off like some deranged and rabid animal, with her digging her fingernails into my shoulder and raking them across my shoulderblade and down the back my arm.  So I did what any loving and patient mother would do.  I dropped her.  Not carelessly or violently of course, but I placed her on her feet by my side, and took firm grasp of her arm as I lead her inside.  She continued her protest by screaming and crying - you'd think  I  had scratcher  her .  After giving a lecture on the importance of listening to Mommy, I decided it would be prudent to wash my newly acquired stripes with a little hydrogen peroxide.  Just to be on the safe side.

       The Saintliness of Diva   When you were a kid, what did you want to be when you grew up?  I alternately wanted to be either an artist or a nun.  No kidding.    Some days I would make drawings, create little picture books, and doodle endlessly with the idea that one day I would use my god-given talent to create great works of art.  Other days I would drape a towel over my hair and, instead of pretending it was long flowing locks, would imagine myself in a nuns habit.  I wondered how I would look as one of gods servants.  I wasnt even Catholic.  Of course, it never occurred to me that I could possibly do both  be an artist and a servant.  Some people figured that out and created great works of art devoted to their faith and religion.  I guess it just wasnt meant for me.  These days, I dont paint or draw.  Although I've got plenty of servitude going on while I'm raising my children.  And believe me, there are plenty of days when I achieve sainthood, simply by not killing them during those more trying times.  Diva out.

       Not another lame excuse   Candy Genius recently listed several  urlLink lame excuses  she's received.  Upon requested a volunteer to fill in a PM Manager's shift here at the hotel, I received this beauty of an excuse:  "I can't. I'll be out of the country, competing in a gator wrestlin' apple bobin tourney"   Ed  How can you argue with that?  I've requested photos for proof.  If I get any, I'll load 'em up for y'all.

       Munday again  Well, I survived the weekend with my 4 year old diva-ette.  It's really hard work to keep a four-year-old entertained.  We accompanied a friend to the salon, walked over to grocery store for a snack, had lunch at Denny's (an adventure all on it's own!), went to the park, then the pool, where we got rained out.  All of this was before 4pm on Saturday!     It was great fun playing leap frog with her last night before bed time.  I need a nap.  Diva out.

       Frequent Reminder  I must remember to read this very often...   Don't spend time beating on a wall, hoping to transform it into a door. -  Dr. Laura Schlessinger   Really really good advice for me.  And of course, remembering to not beat that wall with my head would also be good.  Diva out.

       Romance still has a slight heartbeat  It's not quite dead.  One of our salesmen is heading to NYC for a sales trip in July.  He's planned a weekend getaway for himself and his girlfriend before he starts working the city on that Monday.  So, he had me help him book a room at The Plaza Hotel in NYC.  He intends to take his girlfriend on a carriage ride through Central Park and propose to her.  All together now, ladies... AAAAAAWWWWWW!!!!!!  Gets you right dead in the middle of the chest, doesn't it? *sigh*  Diva out.

       News  I didn't get a chance to see my premier appearance on Deco Drive last night, but from what I hear I didn't miss much.  No shots of the Diva, just the Wine Club itself.  Which is fine because, after all, the Wine Club is the real star.  And, in other news, I was informed last night that DBD has a job. Finally... a friggin' job.  It doesn't pay nearly as much as he is accustomed to and he will continue to search for another, higher paying job, while he takes this one.  Yeah, whatever.  The way I see it, it sure as hell pays more than unemployment.  And now I can be sure to receive at least one child support payment this year.  Let's see how long he keeps this job.  *sigh*  And even more news, my oldest diva goes to New Jersey with her grandmother tomorrow.  She'll be gone for two weeks, and will take a visit to NYC this Saturday night.  I hooked 'em up at the same hotel I stayed at when I was there two weeks ago.  Two weeks - has it been that long already?  I want to go back again soon.  Anyway, my little diva will have a good time visiting family in New Jersey, and I'll only have one littlest diva to care for while she's gone.  I miss her already.  Diva out.

       Mindful Meandering  I think I'm a little like a flower.  Without a little love and attention, a little encouragement, I just wilt away.  I lose interest and fade away.  There's always a little sunshine streaming down from somewhere else anyway.  Diva out.

       Huge Success  The Wine Club event was wonderful.  I had about 89 guests show up, and most of them paid (12 comps out of 89 isn't too bad).  I just love it when lots of people show up for an event; I turn into this super-human social butterfly.  Shaking hands, smiling, welcoming everyone to the party ~ you'd think it was MY party.  And in a way it is.  I got to sample a really wonderful white wine from Spain last night - I carried my glassful around all night long, nursing it for over an hour.  I'm taking a bottle of it home tonight if there's any left.  I'm thinking a little sushi and a glass or two of the white wine will finish my week off quite nicely.    I even got to do a TV interview last night.  That's right, I've graduated from print to television.  I'm not quite sure how its going to turn out and I'm not sure I want to see it when it does air.  We'll see... that may be my limit on those 15 minutes of fame. ;)  Heading out for a very quiet weekend (I hope).  Have a fabulous weekend for me!  Diva out.

       Wine Club tonight!  I've planned a really big event for tonight and have 70 RSVPs; nevermind the few that didn't call but will show up anyway.    And, besides the wine tasting event, there's going to be a performance in our pool.    "Making a splash this summer, Momentum Dance Company will perform Water Study and Plunge at the National Hotel, in our famous Infinity Pool.  Performance begins at 7pm, and then immediately following this special presentation, The Wine Club presents its summer wine spectacular, featuring seasonal favorites like Zaca Mesa Viognier, Benton Lane Pinot Noir, Rene Mure Gewurztraminer, Mas de Bressades Grenache and other cool, crisp selections.  All wines will be perfectly complemented by Chef Greg McDaniels French fusion inspired hors doeuvres."    Sounds good, huh?  I'll let you know tomorrow.  Cheers!  Diva out.

       NCY Details   Brief synopsis: My hotel was in Midtown Manhattan, so I had immediate access to Broadway, Times Square, Central Park and more. MoMa Queens - saw works from true masters like Cezanne, Dali, Van Gogh (Starry Starry Night!) and Gauguin... just to name a few. Rockefeller Center - gorgeous example of true Art Deco style St. Patrick's Cathedral - arches overhead were breathtaking Radio City Music Hall - people were lining up outside to watch arrivals for the Tony Awards Washington Square - it was late, we saw the movie 2 Fast 2 Furious.  It was strange to watch Miami on the screen in New York China Town - the best Chinese food I've ever had, and my friend ordered in Chinese; it doesn't get more authentic than that! Puerto Rican Day Parade - so much fun with great music and dancing  Saw an authentic NYC rat - running along the subway track - yuck!  I took more pictures of the parade than I needed to; the edited version of my pictures (if you haven't already checked them out) is  urlLink here .  No pics of the diva this time, maybe next time.  I want to go back in August, before my girls go back to school.  Travelling is just easier that way.    I could get used to luxury hotel life; I was so disappointed last night when I got home from work to see that the maid forgot to do turndown on my bed!  I missed finding a chocolate on my pillow ~  Diva out.

Will post later on my fab NY trip, and will find time to load the pics too.    And one unexpected bonus to the trip, I didn't have to come in on a Monday ~ it's Tuesday already.  woo-hoo!

       Busy Busy Busy   My boss came back from a two week vacation - some of it spent in Hawaii.  Now he's come back all energized with a great big "S" in the middle of his chest. Ready to conquer the world and correct all the evils that have befallen our beloved hotel.  Lax attitudes, miscommunication, negative attitudes, unfocused managers, etcetera etcetera.    Friggin' Energizer Bunny in a suit.  Super GM, here to save the day.  He caught me waaaaaay off guard.  So, I don't really have much time for blogging right now.  And may have even less time.  I somehow convinced him that I would be more effective as an assistant if I actually had office/desk space near or in his office.  Right now we sit in two different offices, with a great big wall between us.  And sorry, my X-ray eyes and super-human hearing don't seem to working as well as they used to.  Could it be a plot against Super GM and the Diva?  Could Madame Kevetcher have planted cryptonite in my bottom desk drawer?  Tune in again, dear readers, to find out!  *a-hem* Sorry, got a little carried away for a second there.  Diva out.

       Back in the office, back on my blog   I'm back.  I have to say that 2 weeks is too long to be away from home.  It felt sooooo good to get home on Saturday evening.  And, believe it or not, I was actually excited to be going back to work.  It's just an extension of home.  Now, I have the daunting task of uploading and organizing 275 photos.  It's going to take me a while, and before I'm done there may not be as many photos.  I'm deleting as I go.  Man, I took a lot of pictures of nothing!    I've made some progress on the photos, and you can see Fred's contribution to the photo files as well as a few of my St. Augustine pics.  Just check out my photo galleries with that link over there on the right.    That's all for now.  Tons of work to do.  But it's good to be back.  Diva out.

       Absence makes the heart grow fonder   And as much as i love my family, the longer I'm absent, the better.  I remember now why I live in Miami, so very far away.  But, isn't that what growing up is about?  You know; growing up, moving away and unlearning all the wrong things your parents taught you.   You've come a long way, baby.  I head out again tomorrow.  I'm taking the Cherahola Skyway - the scenic route - through the Cherokee National Forest.  This road will lead me into Cherokee, NC where we will stop to visit the Cherokee Bear Zoo.  In Downtown Cherokee. *grin*  According to my father, his grandmother was (at least part) Cherokee, so this will be like visiting my roots; learning about my heritage.  Only with cheap souvenirs and caged "bears, big cats and monkeys."  Fun and educational, as the tourist brochure points out.  Then its on to Savannah.  The Hostesss City of the South.  I'm about half way through my book, and I can't wait to see the squares that are described.  We're staying on a hotel on River Street.  The River Street Inn, as a matter of fact.  We get handmade chocolates and Godiva Hot Chocolate at night.   Ooooooh, you know how I feel about turndown.  Fred had intended to leave chocolates on our pillows at the Ranch.  And despite his oversight in doing so, I have neglected to mention that we had a faaaaabulous time in Musella with Fred.  He and Pumpkin were the perfect hosts.   Gotta hit the sack now ( I may have been in the hills too long).  Long day and long drive ahead of me tomorrow... and I can't wait!  PS - I hope you are enjoying the audio posts.  I'm getting more comfortable as I go and the posts are getting longer.  I hope I'm not boring you ;)  Diva out.

       greetings from NE Tennessee  I tried several times yesterday to see my blog with no luck.  Maybe blogger was down?  Anyway, I was able to see my site this morning, and it feels like home.  As weird as it might be, I've missed checking the other blogs on my blogroll.  And I was anxious to hear my posts.  I'm concerned that by mingling with all these country folk I may pick up the accent.  My nephews have it real bad, so bad that sometimes I can't understand what they're saying.  They've lived in unpopulated areas all of their lives.  Bluff City, where we are now, is the most populated area they've ever experienced.  And everyone here has varying levels of southern drawl.  It grows on you, and if you live in it long enough you pick it up.  Like a foreign language.    So, I was pleased to hear my audblog posts this morning and find that I haven't succumbed to the drawl.  I have always worked hard to keep my speech free of any identifying accents or drawls.  I'm just plain ol' diva, from nowhere and everywhere at the same time.  Everyone asks me where I'm from because they really can't tell from my speech and I like that.  Anyway, I'm having a really good time.  This is my first vacation in 7 years and for once, I'm the one sending the postcards.  I always ask travelling friends to bring me back a postcard.  Now I'm the one doing the travelling and it's nice for a change.  Tomorrow we're going to the Ripley's Aquarium in Knoxville - downtown Knoxville of course.  There's this huge tank with a tunnel you walk through that takes you under the fish and sharks.  Should be cool... maybe I could do an audblog post from under there.  Have to try that.  Diva out.

       Howdy from Musella  I'm blogging from Mussella, Ga.  If you try to find it on a Georgia map, its near Lizella.  But you may not be able to find that on a map either.  It's outside of Macon, which has a really nice historic downtown district.  We're going shopping tomorrow.  Yes, even in the country, the diva finds shopping.  Now if I could just find a Starbucks...  I tried an audio blog earlier today.  Not sure if it I did it right, so if you don't  see hear it hear now, try back later.  I'll see if I can get it to work.  Diva out.

      oh, one more thing.  i have discovered where i want to live.  i really want to buy a place of my own now and i really want it to be in the same area where i already live - Downtown Miami.  a developer is building lofts in my area - i love the idea. and it would allow enough space for me and my diva-ettes to lay out our yoga mats every night and really get serious about yoga.    its even close to the new Performing Arts Center, which i can't wait to be finished.  the whole miami area is really growing and changing, and i'm sort of excited about being in the thick of it all.  i'm setting my sights  urlLink here ''  I really am turning into a downtown diva!  diva out for real this time.

       busy busy day  gearing up for my road trip now.  i tried to resist paying bills, but some i just had to pay, so now i will have less money than i planned for.  but i know how to work a budget and stretch a dollar like the toughest yoga asana, so i know i'll be ok.  thinking happy thoughts and looking forward to hitting the road.  but today i'm in the office with oh so many projects to complete before i go.  so, just a quick post today and then i'll get down to business.  i just wanted to comment on how multi-cultural my girls are.  i have noticed that they have so many different friends from so many races and religions, and it makes me happy.  I never knew any muslim kids, or taiwanese/chinese kids, or catholic kids or even african-american kids.  i grew up in the new era of bussing and desegregation but there was very little socializing done among the different races.  the closest i ever got to diversity was my italian/american cousins and even they lived very far away.  its encouraging for me to see my children playing with other children just because they have fun together.  and sometimes i get to share a little knowledge and teach a little tolerance.  last night, my oldest diva overheard someone talking religion by the pool.  he was talking about jesus to some muslim kids, and my daughter said, "Muslims don't believe in god."  I briefly explained the small differences between the two religions.  that little optimist in me can't help but believe that if i can teach my children they may teach their children.  eventually, we will all understand that we are all one.  ok.  gotta get some work done.  diva out.

       Munday  Ok, so the holiday wasn't so bad.  Worked a few hours in the AM, then went shopping!  Can you believe Burdines actually gave me a credit card?  I was shocked.  Then I shopped.  I needed a few things for my upcoming road trip, and Burdines was kind enough to foot the bill... for a little while.   It's actually part of a bigger plan for me as I hope to buy a place to call my own in the next few years.  Building my credit is required, and this is a step in the right direction.  Getting to shop is just an added bonus ;)  Spent the late afternoon to evening on the beach with about 50,000 strangers, and of course my little divas and my in-law family.  A collection of grown ups, divorced and not dating - kind of sad actually.  What's sadder is that I'm part of that group *sigh*  But we had fun, and the fireworks show was one of the best I've seen yet (they do keep getting better and better).  And for a minute or two I relaxed and had fun.    Then the pyromaniac jerks started firing up everything they could get their hands on - bottle rockets, firecrackers, jumping jacks, blah blah blah.  No consideration for the throngs of people surrounding them, the children running barefoot in the sand, the people relaxing close by.   The paranoid mom in me reared her ugly head and we got the hell out of there before some sand dune caught fire.    Then of course there was the 45 minutes of traffic to contend with.  But at least the littlest diva in the backseat fell fast asleep, so the wait was a quiet one.  Unless you count the futile horns in the background pushing everyone ahead when there was no where to go.  Breathe in, breathe out.  Wax on, wax off.  Diva out.

       Happy Fourth  I'm not feeling exceptionally patriotic right now.  This never was my favorite holiday.  And this year, all the "pops" and "booms" just make wonder what it was like in Bagdad earlier this year, and still.  It's not just noise there.  I've always considered it strange that we would recreate a war scene to celebrate our independence.  Because, that's what the fireworks remind me of; one big boom and instantly my mind is crouched down in a foxhole somewhere, - rat-a-tat-tat - trying to stay alive.  I must have died in combat as a soldier in a previous life, because images of war and violence are just too real and scary for me.  But, my children are fortunate enough to not suffer from this overactive imagination, and they love the gleaming streaming colors in the night sky.  So, I'll watch their faces light up with delight and try not to think all those horrible ugly thoughts.  "Being touched by one's children is a delight to the body, And listening to them chatter is a joy to the ear." -Tirukkural 65  I have my family and I have more material things and personal freedoms than so many in this world.  I was lucky enough to be born here.  I'm thankful for that, and it is something to celebrate.  So, light a sparkler up for me.     Have fun. Be safe. Diva out.

       Stepping up to the soapbox  Yes, I'm in that kind of a mood today.  Read on if you like, and if you don't... ok.  I just have to say that if I hear one more newscaster report how more and more Americans are overweight, and how the FDA is stepping up and getting stricter on food labels... yada yada yada.  I'm going to throw a food pyramid and start screaming expletive RDA's at somebody!  Almost nobody I know actually reads the labels, and if they do they're looking for the one thing their doctor told them to watch out for.  Watch your sodium or watch your cholesterol.  Come on, do you really look at the back of that Oreo package to count fat grams before scarfing down the whole damn box?  Trans fats?  Yeah, whatever.  Americans are infamous for blaming everyone else for what's wrong with them.  Don't blame McDonalds for serving you a bigger burger and more fries.   If you get in your car and drive there (most of the time we don't even expend any energy to get OUT of the car - they bring the food to your car), and if you order the super-size fries and the double cheeseburger with bacon and the super-size DIET coke, then how is it their fault that you devour the whole damn thing before you even make it back home to flop down on the sofa for a nap?    Screw the food pyramid, I want my Haagen Daaz Caffe Mocha Frappe Ice Cream NOW!    Most Americans over eat and under exercise. Period.  A nice 20 or 30 minute walk at lunch time, smaller portions and more water make such a difference in the quality and length of a lifetime.  If you gotta have the Oreos, then swim a lap in the pool tomorrow.  If you're planning for a big dinner, have a light lunch.    Its easy to make the change, but its easier still to put the blame on someone else and continue to complain about how your pants don't fit like they used to.   *Diva now humbly steps down from her soapbox*   Diva out.

       Worst comb-over ever  Last night I saw that the new Merriam Webster dictionary is out, and includes 10,000 new words.  Words that we use every day, but have never found in any dictionary ever before.  Words like hip hop, wack, dope and phat.  Also the word comb-over has been added.  When I saw that, I was instantly reminded of the worst comb-over I've ever seen.  Actually it was pretty recently, maybe just a week or two ago.  On Lincoln Road on South Beach, where everyone strives to be their absolute most fabulous at all times.  He was obviously from the Elvis-era.  He was in relatively good shape, considering his apparent age - I'm guessing late 50's to early 60's.  I can't even remember what he was wearing, since I was blinded by his comb-over.    Picture this if you dare:  Snow-white, Elvis side-burns, down the sides of his face to below the ears.  Then brushed w-a-y back,  over his ears  so that the ends met at the back of his mostly BALD head.   )(     As if we're not supposed to notice that he has no other hair except his sideburns.  Guys, please, if you're losing your hair and you're considering the comb-over... don't.  Go the way of MJ and Sean Connery, and just speed up nature's process by going bald.  Shave as you ruin nature's cruel joke with a mocking laugh at destiny, or be proud of your waning hairline.  Just be brave about the whole aging thing.  We women have to deal with vericose veins and sagging boobs.  You have hair loss.  Deal with it.  Diva out.

       Decisions, decisions  Okay, so on the one hand I have an upcoming 2 weeks of vacation and a paycheck to blow.  On the other hand, I have an ever-inceasing debt due to the daycare.  About the amount of one paycheck at this point.  So, pay the bills or have fun?  Believe it or not, I'm actually not sure what to do.  I've got my whole trip planned, and people are excited and anxious for the arrival of the diva and her little divas.  And, after 4 years of really crappy stress and hard work, I believe I deserve a great vacation.  But, there's this little conscience jerk whispering in my ear that I really should get caught up on this bill.  It would be the right thing to do.  So, I'm working on ignoring the whisper and figuring out how to pay the bill as soon as I get back! *sigh*  I really hate being a grown up.  On a happier note,  my little jet-setter diva returns home today!  I can't wait to see her, she's probably grown 4 inches since I last saw - a whole 12 days ago.  Yay! She's home, she's home.  Of course her little sister isn't nearly as excited as I am.  She has really enjoyed being an only child for a while.  Also, I'm doing something nice for someone I care about today.  I can't wait till he gets my little surprise.  I love doing nice things for people I care about.  Diva out.

       Mars Mania  Have you had a chance to see Mars yet?  It's so close to the earth right now that its just screaming "Look at Me!" up there in the night sky.  Other than the moon and one or two constellations, it's just about the only celestial object I can identify.  And now its even easier to find.    I took a few moments to contemplate the red planet last night from my balcony, and i started to get a little nervous about what it's close proximity may portend.  All the astrologers are buzzing with the possibilities, while the astronomers are just happy to get such an upclose look.  Here's something i found this morning online.  Haven't had time to read it yet, but thought i'd share it with you.  From  urlLink Beliefnet.com .  I've already had a whirlwind of a day and my emotions have gone haywire.  I'm going to blame it on Mars, eat a pint of Ben & Jerry's tonight and just move on.  Diva out.

       "You can do this."  That's what I told my littlest diva this morning, when the tears started welling up in her big brown eyes.  We sat nose to nose; me squatted down on the red, yellow and blue rug, her perched precariously on the edge of her very small pre-k chair.  "You're brave and strong, and I know you can do this."  She looked at me, chin quivering, and said, "No I can't.  I can't do this, Mommy."  I almost lost it.  I was being the brave and reassuring mommy, introducing her to the classroom, reminding her that this is just like daycare.  Telling her how her day would be busy with new faces and places and that, while it may be a little scary now, tomorrow would be better.  And I would see her this evening and she should tell me all about it.  Then I walked out of there with her with Grandma as back up.  Grandma had met us there this morning with camera in hand for this very important first day.  One diva-ette to 5th grade, one to pre-K.  Big day.  I left the class room with its miniature tables and chairs, primary colored alphabet and number charts, smiling faces and not smiling faces, with my littlest diva progressing from a whimper to a howl as I closed the door behind me.  Grandma wrapped my baby in her arms for comfort.    "I'm doing the right thing.  I'm doing the right thing.  I'm doing the right thing." I walked down the hall and out of the school, holding back the tears welling up in my own big brown eyes.  Diva out.

       Friday!!!!  woo-hoo!  yeah!  hooray!!!!  the only reason i'm so excited about today being friday is that today i pick up my little divas and bring them home.  not just for the weekend, but for good.    they've been staying with their grandmother, my mother-in-law, for the past 4 weeks.  and while it may sound nice to have a break from motherhood, i haven't really enjoyed it.  instead i've been working 10 hours a day in the office and then going home and straight to bed.  turns out i actually like being a mom.  who knew?  so my girls are coming home tonight, and we have the whole weekend together before school starts on monday.  i'm planning on indulging them in any way i can.  ice cream for dinner?  ok.  hit the pool before breakfast?  sure, let's go.  i just want to soak them in again; i'm so glad they're coming home.  and my littlest diva is all registered for pre-k - its so exciting!  i'm going to get her some uniforms today and we already bought the new school supplies.  i think i'm just as excited about the new school year as my girls.  so, no more working long long hours, no more going home to an empty apartment.  just my everyday, boring life as a single mom - just the way i like it.  have a fabulous weekend everyone - i'm looking forward to mine.  diva out.

       In response  Or,   not quite myself today   Pippa, congrats and welcome home.  sorry about the tragicness of it all, and the blackout must have made motherhood that much worse ;)   Fred, i hadn't even noticed the parallels between the two - and had tried to block it all out.  thanks for reminding me.   Candy and Doc, i know you're responsible for it all.  two brains driving around the country, in the spot where the blackout occurs.  coincidence?  i think not.  say what you will, you will not convince me otherwise (hee hee)    and finally, i recieved this today, and just had to share: To those of you who send me those damn "forward this e-mail to 10 of your friends, or else..." this is how i feel....

       Lights Out  Terrorism?  I think not.    urlLink Doc  is there, and think he tripped barefoot on the plug!  :P  But, really, what is it more than just a huge inconvenience?  Let's see... no lights, no a/c, no hot water for a shower, no stove to cook, no fridge.  Eating ravioli and tuna fish out of the can, drinking bottled water and warm coke.  Reading for entertainment, or listening to a battery-powered radio.  Why does this seem so familiar to me?  Oh, wait! I know, because of a little thing called Hurricane Andrew a few years ago.    No power for a week or more for some.  I didn't have hot water for about 3 weeks, but hey, a cold shower in August isn't a bad thing.    And, placed side by side with what happened on 911 or what Iraq experienced as a result of 911, this is just not as bad.  No one died in an attack, no one lost a home or family member (although some may now due to the heat or medical concerns).    It is a huge inconvenience, but fortunately not a huge tragedy.  And, helloooo - 3 day weekend.  I'm workin' here!  Don't hate me because I have perspective, people.  And really, you've got to give NY'ers credit.  They're a tough group of people who come through everything in style.  So, this is just one more thing they've lived to tell about.  Diva out.

       School Daze  Okay, so the title for this post isn't exactly original.  Give me a D for creativity.  I went to register my littlest diva for pre-k today.  I thought I was going to sign her up for the city program, run out of a pavillion at a park.  I figured for $50 a month, it could be a good thing.  Except the program ends at 2pm, without an afterschool program.  And there's nobody around to take her to the public school "afterschool" program just across the street.  So, I walked myself across the street and checked out the public pre-k program.  Yes there's space available, and no it doesn't matter that I don't live in their district.  I guess at $85 a week, they don't care where you live.  If you can afford it, your kid can attend it.    So, on the one hand I will be paying a fortune for what should be free (and will be in about 3 years), and on the other hand, I won't have to leave work everyday to walk my child across the street.  Convenience costs.  Now I have to buy the uniforms that go along with this public pre-k.  The good news is my oldest diva goes to the same public school (its actually very good), and some of her uniform tops may be handed down to our newest pre-k student.  I just have to tack on a couple hundred dollars to my already very expensive August.  Come on, tax credit!  Diva out.

       IM Etiquette  Considering the current trend over at  urlLink frenchy's , I should probably be asking her this.  When using IM, how long do you wait before deciding that you are being intenionally ignored?  Is it rude to send a message when someone has the status set at "busy"?  Should you expect a response, if the status is "busy"?  And if you send a note to someone who is "busy" and they NEVER respond, should you assume that you are being ignored?  It took me a while to master certain social standards in the human world.  Modern cyber etiquette may take me forever to figure out.  *sigh*  Diva out.

       Culture Club  Tonight, I'm going to see a French film accompanied by a light picnic.  I've been invited as a result of my last Wine Club event.  I worked with the Miami Beach Film Society on my last event, so now they've invited me to this event at their newly opened Cinemateque.  I'm so excited - mostly because this event will be free for me.  Tomorrow, I'll take my girls to the Miami Art Museum for family day.  Also a free event.   Followed by the library - that's right... free.  I just love that I am able to soak up so much culture for free.  Also, its just been decided that we are going to take advantage of a city-wide cultural program called Artists in Residence.  We will exhibit the work of 8 artists staying on Miami Beach for the month of August and use the mailing lists of three large organizations in addition to my own.  Art, culture, wine and hors d'oeuvres.  Who could ask for more - and we should expect about 300 guests (a record for my Wine Club events).  We'll hold an event sponsored by the city, and for once the attendees will be paying to attend!  I'm so excited about this event that I can't wait to get to work on it.    Life at work is good, and the fringe benefits that come with it help keep me smiling.   Have a fabulous weekend!  Diva out.

       That's interesting   Well, friends, after having seen "Pirates of the Caribbean" last night, I have to say that the quiz down there was right.  I am most like Jack Sparrow.  I mean, you know, without the heavy black eye makeup, the braided goatee, the gold teeth and the really dirty fingernails *yuck*.  And I'm not quite as quircky as that character.  At least I don't think I am; although some of my friends may argue that point.  But there are many similarities; for example people will often underestimate my capabilities.  And god knows I get by on more luck than strategy.  I do have a tendency to wax verbose and poetic, and I have a very deep-seated faith in my self and in who I am.  I genuinely believe that as long as I stay focused on my goal, I will achieve it.  Its completely unthinkable that I won't finally get exactly what I want.  And then there's that whole lust for freedom that we share.  The movie had its strengths and weaknesses.  Also, being a Disney movie, it couldn't help but poke fun at the ride at Disney World.  The little dog with the key outside the cell... that's in the movie.  And Capt. Jack Sparrow makes a clever joke about the dog - but not everyone in the theater laughed.  Maybe they've never been.    I laughed a lot, and I left there feeling really good.  That's what a movie should do, I think.  I felt elated and free when I walked out of the theater; sort of like Jack in the closing scene as he stood at the helm and headed for the horizon.  Diva out.

       My day was better  Just when you think things are rough, you find out someone else has it rougher.  I spoke with DBD this morning to find out when I can expect my first child support payment from his new job.  He informed me that he wasn't sure, but that I would be receiving something very soon, since he was arrested over the weekend.  What!  Yup.  DBD went to jail over the weekend.  He was stopped while driving and as there was a warrant out for his arrest, he was taken into custody.  He had to borrow $1000 - exactly what he's owed the judge for purge for almost a year - to get himself out of jail.  I feel bad that it went that far.  I never really wanted him to be arrested.  But, he could have borrowed the damn money when he got the notice of contempt a few months ago.  Avoiding his responsibilities finally caught up with him.    The amazing thing is that no one in his family told me about this.  I was there all day Saturday and not one person said anything.    So, at least I should be able to get my car out of the shop soon.  What he had to pay to get out will come directly to me - and it should do so very soon.  Diva out.

       An Epiphany  Fred, you probably should stop reading this right now. I know how you hate it when I get philosophical.  But I had an epiphany last night.  I was practicing yoga and almost ready to go into the rest pose when it hit me.  I've always said that pain is a warning, but I never really fully understood that, until last night.   I didn't hurt myself or anything.  I was sitting with my legs (almost) in lotus, with my forehead resting on the floor.  And I had this urge in the back of my head to sit up.  I resisted as long as I could, but then I realized that I needed to sit up.  The urge was strong enough to push me up.    In that position, I always think about being a seed buried deep in the dirt.  What makes it want to grow?  It must be that urge to rise.  The hunger and need to change and grow.  You know how an old pair of shoes can just start to hurt?  Time for new ones.  Or when those size 6 jeans just don't fit anymore?  Time to acknowledge there's been a change, and react with a change of jeans.    On a deeper level, sometimes when we feel like something just isn't right it's because we need to grow, to make a change.  The hard part isn't only noticing the hurt, but also figuring out what's causing the hurt.  Discovering what needs to change can be so very hard.  But, once you figure it out, the ache goes away.  That little urge inside you, bugging the hell out of you, quiets down and goes away when you've taken the right action and made the right change.  Everything changes, and when we don't change too, it just hurts.  Diva out.

       The Word of the Day   navel-gazing \NAY-vul-GAY-zing\ noun   : useless or excessive self-contemplation    Example sentence: Instead of more of the feel-good lyrics and beats that launched her to stardom, the songs on the diva's sophomore release border on tedious philosophizing and navel-gazing.    Did you know? If you are scratching your head over something, then you are probably in a state of puzzled contemplation. But if you are staring at your navel, you could either be indulging in some useless self-contemplation or in a state of deep meditation. If the latter, the technical term for your activity would be "omphaloskepsis," which is a form of meditation that has been practiced by mystics for centuries. Navel-gazing is a pop form of omphaloskepsis that is devoid of any serious meditative value. The word has been used more or less depreciatingly since its first appearance in 1963.   NOTE: Today's Word of the Day can be found in the NEW Eleventh Edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, along with more than 10,000 new words and senses.

       Little Miss Know-it-all   Last night my littlest diva announced that she knows everything.  Of course, I, in my infinite wisdom and understanding, explained to her gently that she can't know  everything , no one knows  everything .  Then my other diva-ette began quizzing her, "Oh.  You know everything?  Ok, so what's 2 + 2?"    Then they went back and forth with tests of knowledge.  I just smiled and enjoyed the happy chatter and banter.  This morning when I dropped her off at class, what's the first thing I hear from another mother?  "Your daughter knows everything! She always has the answers to all my questions, she's little miss 4-1-1."  So, apparently I was wrong.  She does know  everything .    Diva out.

       My babies are growing up *sob*   This morning, the littlest diva announced that she wanted her big sister to take her to class.  Not her mommy, her sister.  I was dumbfounded; I responded with something like, "Really?  Are you sure?"  She was sure alright.  So instead of parking and walking her to class, I pulled into the drop off lane along side the school.  I was still in disbelief, but they popped off their seatbelts, gathered their things and hopped out.  I had to beg for a goodbye kiss from the little one - she was already half way out the door.    I watched with tears welling up as the two of them walked hand in hand into the school, the littlest one's lunchbag dangling down past her knees because she's just so small.  If I had a camera I would have clicked off a picture of this; the day my diva-ettes worked together without me to guide them.    WAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!  Diva out.

       Munday  Not such a bad monday, as monday's go.  Called the Child Support Division bright and early this morning to find out the status of that bond payment DBD payed at the beginning of August.  Still waiting on that nice little chunk of change and wanted to know when I could expect it in my pocket.  Turns out whoever was supposed to set the court date didn't set the court date.  Now the lady I spoke to has to contact the legal department to get the date set.  I can't get my grubby little hands on that money until the judge releases it to me.  i'm thinking some little date-setter had a nice little shopping spree with my money!  Anyway, it would appear that I now have the wheels in motion, and maybe I'll get a notice in the mail or something.    Figures now that the mercury retrograde is over things are starting to move along.  Diva out.

       Back in Happy Mode  I was feeling a little off kilter for a few days, but I'm back to my old happy self again.  It never takes long... to paraphrase a song I hear last night, You can't keep a good girl down!  Went to see the new Woody Allen film last night.  Its only the 2nd or 3rd movie of his that I've seen, but I really really liked it.   I love his selection of music in this movie, and his sense of humor is slightly more dark and twisted than usual (if that's possible).  There were some really creative shots and extremely subtle jokes, and the solo performed by Stockard Channing was moving and sad, to say the least.    Woody's looking pretty old these days, but maybe that was part of the character.  It was hard to tell, because he was pretty much playing himself in this one.  I'm no expert on Woody Allen thoughy, so you go check it out and let me know what you think.  Also, I heard an amazing vocalist last night. After the (Free) movie I went to a (free) live performance of a man who calls himself  urlLink Big Brooklyn Red .  He has a voice that reminded me of sunlight glinting on a pool of water.  Honestly.  When he sang, his voice went from just a regular sound with strong urban influence to this powerful, smooth and clear truth.  After singing three songs, he said he had run out of material.  I thought, "What! this guy only has 3 songs?!  Then he asked someone to suggest a theme, and he'll sing about it.  IMPROVISATIONAL SONGWRITING.  It was amazing.  Someone yelled out, "Black Power!".   Everyone laughed.  Not at the subject matter, but at the implications it represented.   Big Brooklyn Red is a slightly rounded, average height caucasion, ruddy complexion with blond hair twisted into a braid, laying lifeless down his back.  Very cool shades cover his, probably blue, eyes from the bright stage lights.  But, he did it.  It was phenomenal how the band jammed together on a completely improv'ed beat and tune, and then he picked up with lyrics that he gathered from the air around him.  One of his lines included, "I've been every color, black, white, brown and yellow" and he spoke of how he understands so much more than a white man should, and the chorus was something about "Whites rock and roll, why don't you just stay easy.  All that black power, gonna make you greasy."  It was gritty with a funky Shaft kind of groove, and the crowd was overwhelmed by this white man in shades.    At least I know I was.

       Bonus Blog   Diva innocently answers phone - mistake #1: "Hello, may I help you?"  Crazy lady at other end, "Yes.  I received a message from Joe Schmoe saying that supposedly he works for your hotel and arranges hotel accommodations for production and movie industry clients, and supposedly he is planning a trip to LA and is setting appointments to meet with potential clients."  Poor trusting and clueless Diva responds, "Yes. That's right.  Joe does work for us and he is planning his trip to LA.  How can I help you?"  Crazy Lady: "I want to know how he got my number!"  Innocent Diva: "Oh.  Well, I don't know, but he may have gotten it from an Industry Directory.  He's never been to LA before and he's very excited about meeting with industry clients in that area.   Are you involved in the production industry?"  Crazy Lady: "No, I'm not."  Diva: "Oh.  Well, then its possible he misdialed."  Crazy Lady: "No. I don't think so.  I want to know how he got my number."   .  Diva, trying to find a clue here: "Did he address you by name in his message?"  Crazy Lady, taking every piece of info she can get, "Yes, I think he did.  How did he get my number? I want to know how he got my cell phone number!"  Diva, still trying to be helpful: "I'm sorry but I don't know how he got your number.  Would you like to speak to him?"  Crazy Lady: "Yes, I would".  Diva tries to transfer call, but Joe Schmoe is not at his desk and the voicemail picks up.  A smart Diva would have sent Crazy Lady into Voicemail Nirvana, but instead she goes back to the caller.  This is mistake #2.  Diva: "I'm sorry, but Mr. Schmoe is not at his desk and I'm getting his voicemail.  If you'd like, I can take your information and investigate this for you."  Crazy Lady: "Yes, that's fine.  And can I call you back for the details?"  Diva: "If you will give me your name and number and the company you work for, I can find out for you and call you back."  Crazy Lady: "No, that's ok.  I don't want to give you my number."  Diva, "Who am I speaking with?"  Crazy Lady pauses deviously:"...Kimberly.  And nevermind, I'll find this out my own way!"  Poor, dazed Diva hears Krazy Kimberly's "click" on the other end.  Moral of the story?  Anybody, anybody?    Diva out

       Ignorance is Bliss   If thats the case, then there are lots of really happy people out there.  I occasionally experience an oblivious person on the street; you know, that guy who doesnt realize anyone else exists in the world.  But, Ive had three such run-ins in the past 6 or 7 days so now Im starting to get a little peeved.  Last week, after I made a left and began to merge into the right lane for a right turn, I discovered that the lady to my right had done the exact same thing.  Only, my turn was legal.  She made a left turn from the middle lane, to my right and then slowed to make the same right turn.  There was no one behind me, so I was able to stop dead in the road and wait for this oblivious woman to make her turn; I then merged right to make my right turn.  If I had been as oblivious as her, I would have merged right INTO her, instead of behind her.  She drove on, never realizing what had happened.  Then, yesterday I made a U-turn so that I could park my car at a meter; a van behind me did the same.  I pulled up behind a lady who was backing into a parallel space and waited for her to pull ahead into the space in front of her.  The van sat behind me, waiting for me waiting for her.  We both assumed that this lady knew we were behind her, waiting on her.  Instead, she remained in the 2nd space instead of pulling ahead to the first space.  I had to back up a little so that I could then maneuver my car into the space behind her, causing the van to back up to make room for me to back up, and then the van had to do the whole thing behind me.  And she never even realized what she had caused  she was oblivious.  Then, this morning, in that same damn left turn, merge into right lane turn (I do this each morning), a man turned left from the turning lane as he should.  But, instead of merging to the right as soon as he could, he waited until he was at the right turn.  I was already in the right lane, getting ready to make the right, when this guy veers into the right lane without signaling, cutting me off as he makes the right turn.  I had to brake, then turn.  He just drove on, oblivious.  Maybe Im just too sensitive to these things right now; maybe these things are reminders to me to be more aware.  Im sure they are reminders for me to avoid anger and act with loving kindness (something Im always working on!).  My question is, how do people live so mindlessly every day?  Its sad and frightening for me to consider that people can just bowl through every day without ever looking up from the edge of their noses to see whats going on around them.  Living mindfully is something that I strive for every day and part of that, to me, means being aware of your surroundings and being aware of your actions.    So, today, I must ask you, my dear reader, to be mindful.  Just for today, stop and consider whats going on around you.  Look before you change a lane or turn a corner.  Think about what youre going to say before you say it.  Chew your food.  Taste your coffee.  Be aware of the air you breathe and the space you occupy.  Please, just for one day, for me.  And Ill try a little harder today, too.  Thanks.  Diva out.

       I love Jonathon Cainer  This man is brilliant... how he does it I just don't know, but he is always so on it!   Tuesday, 9th September 2003  SAGITTARIUS  (Nov 23 - Dec 21)   For a long time you have been living in hope. A change is on the way. This ought to be good news but you find it slightly disturbing. Somehow, in your effort to make a waiting process bearable, you have managed to make it comfortable. Indeed, you have settled so well into your psychological seat that you no longer feel inclined to get out of it. You have not forgotten what it was you were hoping for, but you now see that, if a dream really is to become a reality, awkward adjustments must be made. Indeed they will. But you won't regret this.   Millions may not understand, but believe me; on this one he is so right its scary.  Has something to do with the sing-song a few entries down and I'm still too superstitious to really say much about it.  I just hope that he's referring to what I think/hope he's referring to.  More later... maybe.  Diva out.

       Munday  Had a very relaxing weekend.  The little divas went to Grandma's so I got to sleep in on Saturday and Sunday - nothing more delicious than sleeping in on the weekends.  My hair is back to a rich brown - sans gray - espresso was the name on the box.  so, after a few extra hours of beauty sleep and a dip in dye, I'm feeling most fabulous once again.  Why, I may even paint my toenails tonight!  Ooh, such decadence.  And littlest diva's pre-k teacher came up with a great way of avoiding the morning separation anxiety drama that we've all been subjected to for two weeks now.  Instead of prying her off my leg as I attempt to escape the classroom, the teacher meets us in the cafeteria.  This way, there is a smoother transition from daughter to student.  And you know what?  It works!  I left that little girl in her blue and beige uniform, with tweety bird lunchbox slung across her shoulder, hand in hand with her teacher.  Bye, baby... kiss kiss.  And out the door I went.  No drama, no tears.  Life is good.   ** one note - i've been visiting the blogs that I know and love, and have tried leaving comments.  Sometimes I can, but most of the time my server won't let me leave lovenotes.  Security is so tight on the internet these days, its just so annoying! so, thanks for your comments, and hopefully I will be able to speak my mind on your blog again soon ;)  Diva out.

       Back to NoRmAL  Whatever that is ;)  But I am back in my office, no more bouncing back and forth between two hotels.  I was filling in for the admin at our sister property.  Two hotels, two assistants, One General Manager.  My boss bounces between two hotels every day; I did it for two weeks and am totally wiped out.  I don't know how he does it.  And, a note on the beliefnet.com article on Mars that I listed below.  It's not very good.  So if you haven't read it yet, don't bother.  They managed to confuse the Mercury retrograde with the Mars retrograde (both of which are occurring right now).  Life has slowed down a bit, thanks to the retrogrades - but maybe just for me.  So much is going on around me that I almost feel like I'm sitting in the eye of a storm.  Considering we're deep in hurricane season now (weatherwise, that is), let's hope that I don't end up in an actual storm... that's something I do NOT need right now.  Diva out.

       Happy Halloween!   I'm struggling today with a bad attitude.    I'm surrounded by people who never celebrated Halloween as children (or as adults even), so they lack the traditionalism that I have as an American celebrating this very American holiday.  For me, a pumpkin carving contest should focus on carving the pumpkin.  But not so here.  Here, they dress them up as waiters and maids - full life-size bodies with a pumpkin for a head.  That's more of a scarecrow than a pumpkin as far as I'm concerned.  They look great, but they're not really jack-o-lanterns.  And I refuse to give in; I spent more than an hour scooping and carving on Wednesday night, so that my pumpkin is a close rendition of a  urlLink Tamara de Lempicka painting of two women's faces .  I did it because I wanted to see if I could.  Tamara de Lempicka is the hotel's "patroness" and we have several of her paintings hanging.  Our restaurant is named after her.   Of course there's also this horrible little hope that I could win some cash for my efforts.  But then I remember who I work with.  People from other cultures who don't get the traditional meaning of "carved".  I'm a traditionalist, and I guess I'll end up suffering for my art.   urlLink But I did it  - it looks good and I'm satisfied with my art.  So, Happy Halloween everyone - traditional or not :P  Diva out    PS - Update on the pumpkin - I actually won 2nd place and $50 for my efforts! Yay!

      You know that feeling you get when you look at really old family photographs?   urlLink Look at me  gives me that same nostalgic feeling, and I don't know anyone in any of the pictures.  But then, again I hardly know the people in my family photos either.  Looking at the found photos collected at this website, I can start to imagine that  these people  are my family.  Or, at the very least, just like the people that I call family.  Diva out.

       Oy Vey Am I tired!  Last night I went to a Jewish Wedding.  An orthodox Jewish wedding, where girls sit on one side and boys sit on the other.  It was my first wedding of this faith, and it was nice.  I was a little surprised when the Rabbi starting singing, with three little old men as back up singers to his right.    I probably would have enjoyed the ceremony more had it not been completely in French.  And i got there about 45 minutes late.  It took two hours to trek over to Hialeah to drop off the girls at grandma's house.    But, I had fun at the reception.  I danced the hourah (i know i misspelled that one!) and watched as my friend, the bride, was lifted high above everyone's heads in the "chair of honor".  And there was a great mix of American and French music over several decades.  I danced, I ate, I laughed.    Going home afterwards was not fun.   I got stopped about a block from my house since the lights on the left side of my car don't work.  I don't know why, they just don't.  After informing me of all my faults, and asking if my children are buckled up, he ran my license and found that I'm an honest citizen.  He let me go home, telling me to get my lights fixed.    After getting in around 2am, I think I got about 3 hours of good sleep, what with the full stomach and my littlest diva tossing and turning in bed beside me.    Today my oldest diva-ette goes to her first elementary school Halloween Dance, replete with costume, yummy treats and dancing.  I'm going to drop in for a quick photo.  I'll be sure to share it as soon as I can.  Diva out.

       Whoooosh  My horoscope warned that things would speed up in the end of October, and changes would come.  But I wasn't really prepared for all of this.  My neck hurts, literally, from all the changes going on around me.  I'm so tense, and that's just not like me.  I laid in bed last night trying to find a comfortable spot in my pillow - my neck and shoulders were so tense it hurt to lie still.  I mean, its good that things are moving along again, after the long slow Mercury retrograde last month, but...  Life is just a blur right now.  To wit:  My boss, who used to travel between two hotels, just informed everyone that he will no longer traverse between the two.  He stays here, a new GM goes there.  Which means the pressure will be on me all 40 hours of every work week.  People are getting hired and fired so fast that I feel like I'm working in a new place myself.  Too many new faces and names I can't remember make me a little nervous.  CFF Wine Opener event is next Tuesday; I still have 94 tickets to sell.  Now I'm getting lots of requests, but no closed deals today.  Hands on Miami Day is approaching very fast; at least I've managed to get 8 team members out of my 350+ coworkers.  My boyfriend in NY finally received a reply from one of the resumes he sent out.  He's got an interview - in Dallas.  We'll see what happens there.  On a good note, I finally received the court date to recieve the bail payment DBD had to pay the first weekend of August - when he got picked up on a warrant for not paying child support.  *Note - he's still not sending any money.  Also, I just received the loan check from my 401(k) - I've been trying to locate my funds since we shifted from one company to another since August.  I finally got the right phone number and found my money.  Now I can pay October's rent.   See what I mean - whooosh!  Diva out.

       Revitalized  My service-mindedness has returned, and Im feeling energized again.  Much of this is due to the weekend I had and several messages I received during the past two days.  I got up early and volunteered at The Botanical Garden again.  I always enjoy the time spent puttering around in the dirt, beautifying the garden and doing good for Mother Nature.  I shared my concerns about getting a team together at work for a big volunteer project on November 1st and the lack of interest and teamwork I experience in the office.  Someone reminded me that you cant make people want to help, just offer the opportunity and hope that they get involved.  Then, at church on Sunday, the message was all about partnership in service.  What service means and how it means different things to different people and why some people just dont get involved.  Someone else spoke on how to energize yourself after doing service for others.  Last night I attended an Appreciation Dinner hosted by the Dragon Boat Race Committee and I received a certificate for my efforts at the event last weekend.  I was touched by the consideration, and the food was really good.  Toward the end of the evening, the volunteer coordinator commented on how his faith had been restored after witnessing the willingness of people to get involved and help out.    He took the words right out of my mouth.  Im working on getting a team together for Hands On Miami Day and will plan an appreciation luncheon right afterwards.  Maybe certificates of appreciation for the participants are in order  Diva out

       Big Day in the Lobby   I've seen some pretty interesting things in our hotel's main lobby.  After all, we're here on South Beach, and things are always pretty interesting.  But, today was definitely a red letter day.  Earlier today I went out to the lobby for something or other, and ran into the Power Puff Girls.  No, really.  The Power Puff Girls , and that monkey Mojo Jojo.  Big as life, standing in the lobby for some group that focuses on children's programs in Latin America.  As if that weren't enough, I just witnessed a wedding at the Concierge lobby.  Not the meaningless ceremony with dress and cake, etc.  But the signing of the Marriage License for a wedding ceremony that happened here on Sunday.  Because, let's face it, you can do all the ceremonies you want.  Without that signed piece of paper its all meaningless.  So, as I was witnessing the signing, I signed as a witness on the license.  What a job I have.  Diva out.

       God & Eve    "God, I have a problem."   "What's the problem, Eve?"   "I know that you created me and provided this beautiful garden and all of these wonderful animals, as well as that hilarious snake, but I'm just not happy."   "And why is that, Eve?"   "God, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples."   "Well, in that case, Eve, I have a solution. I shall create a man for you."   "Man? What is that, God?"   "A flawed creature, with many bad traits. He'll lie, cheat and be vain; all in all, he'll give you a hard time. But he'll be bigger, faster and will like to hunt and kill things. He will look silly when aroused, but since you've been complaining, I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs. He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and kicking a ball about. He won't be too smart, so he will also need your advice to think properly."   "Sounds great," says Eve, with ironically raised eyebrows, "but what's the catch, God?"   Well - you can have him on one condition."   "And what's that, God?"   "As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant and self-admiring - so you'll have to let him believe that I made him first. And it will have to be our little secret.   You know, woman to woman."

       Update!  I mentioned to my boss (wonderful man that he is) that I'm off the event planning committee, and explained my personal reason.  Turns out, the owner loves the idea of having the party at the Garden and has already approved it.    So, he said to let the other woman do her due-diligence in looking at other venues, then we veto her and hold it at the garden anyway.  It's not really very nice, but it makes me happy.  Is that bad?  Diva out.

       Lost  I have somehow lost my sense of service recently, and don't know where to find it.  I am always happy to assist with any event, charity or fund-raiser and was always the team leader to organize groups here at work to get involved.  But, after trying to encourage involvement here at work in so many events to no avail, I'm starting to feel discouraged.  After my choice for location was not accepted, I have backed away from planning the employee holiday party.  My idea of the party was that it could be held in a lovely botanical garden at night, here on Miami Beach.  Outside in December in Miami is wonderful weather, generally temperatures range anywhere from 60 to 75 degrees.  We wouldn't have to pay a rental fee, saving $1500 on our limited budget.  Minimal decoration would be needed, leaving more money for food and prizes for staff.  But, someone on the committee is concerned about rain, and wants to find an indoor venue.  One that will cost more money and probably not provide the quality of food that we would get at the Garden.  This person had nothing good to say about our last employee function, but couldn't provide any good input or alternatives.  I just don't want to work with her now.  I'm not going to form a team for Hands On Miami Day on November 1st.  The last time I got involved, it was just me and one of the owner's daughters.  It was embarrassing to see that a company of 500 could only muster the energy of 2.  No one is interested, so I'm not wasting my time with them.  I'll be at Hands On Miami Day, but I'm not working to get a team together.  And I'm not even sure I want to get the two hotels involved in the Toys for Tots program this year, since there was very little participation when we did it two years ago.  But, I'm volunteering for any pick up sites that may need help.  So, maybe I haven't lost my sense of service, just my interest in getting the people that I work with involved in things they don't want to do.  I have so many other things that I can spend my energy on.  What's that bibilical saying about not throwing pearls to the pigs?  Something like that.   I feel like I'm doing something wrong, and maybe I need to get my heart back in the right place.  But for now, I just want to stick to this non-involvement.  Maybe I'm just pouting, or maybe I'm growing up a little.  Diva out.

       Sights & Sounds, part Deux  After listening to my own audio blog, I figured maybe I should explain some of the sounds you hear in that entry.  As the boats approach, you begin to hear a single drum beat, repeated over and over.  Then, there's the steerer, calling the strokes, 1 - 2 - 3...  As the boats get nearer to the finish line, the announcer is cheering on the teams, and encouraging the onlookers to cheer them on as well.  Then, near the end of the entry, there's the finish line caller, watching the line and calling out the boats as they cross the finish, 1! 2! 3!.  It's really very exciting, from the anxious waiting for the race to begin to the final moment when the last boat crosses the finish.    If you ever get the opportunity to attend one of these races, I would highly recommend it.   urlLink Pictures are up now  to help fill in the sounds to give your imagination a more complete image.

       Sights and Sounds  You can hear the sound of a Dragon Boat Race when you click the audio post below (everyone but Fred, that is).  And soon I will post photos at my  urlLink pbase gallery .  Link is to the right -->.  Had a great weekend, filled with sights, sounds and smells all Asian.  Chinese food, music and traditional dance surrounded me.  And I never realized so many Asians speak Spanish!  I met a very nice young Asian lady who was born in Panama.  So many Asians live in South America or marry South Americans... who knew!  There's another Dragon Boat race in Downtown Miami this weekend.  I'm going to attend, and take my girls.  But this time I won't be working the event, I'll be partaking.  mmmm, egg rolls and dumplings.   Diva out.

       Deep Thoughts   "They say it is to know union with love That the soul takes union with the body.   Love makes a man affectionate toward all, And affection affords the priceless treasure of friendship.   They say love's greatness is this: it yields to good families Worldly happiness here and heavenly bliss there."  -Tirukkural 8:72-74  I like this.  And as I watched my girls walking off together to class this morning, I must say that I felt that worldly happiness.  It felt good to know I have these two beautiful girls to love every day that I'm here.    Yep, Diva's feeling deep, philosophical and lovey this morning.  Can you feel the love?

       The Dragons are coming!   For some reason, there is an increase in Asian culture in Miami.  And I couldn't be happier.  I'm volunteering this weekend with the  urlLink First Annual Hong Kong Dragon Boat Festival  this weekend.  I'll be behind the performance stage, doing whatever they need me to do.  Hope I can actually see the boats from where I'm stationed.  I'm looking forward to the exciting races, with the deep beating of drums urging paddlers to row faster.  I'm also looking to the food and merchandise.  I'm hoping to find a relatively inexpensive Kwan Yin statue for my altar at home.  And its really hard to find good Chinese food, so maybe this will be a very  tasty  event.  And, I must confess, I am looking forward to all of the Asian men.  My Asian boyfriend in NY sounded just a little jealous when he pointed out this very obvious benefit to this particular event.  I do like Asian men *blushing slightly*.  So, this is pretty much a win-win for me.  I get to do good by helping others, bring cultural awareness to the city, eat good food, shop, see great cultural performances, and enjoy the eye candy as well.    Now if only my ankle would stop hurting long enough for me to enjoy all of it.  If you're in the Miami Beach area, you may want to check this out too!  Diva out.

       Is this progress?  Sometimes its hard to tell whether I'm moving forward or backward.  So, let us review, shall we?  Littlest diva has recovered from her week-long fever.  Only last night did I find the source of the fever - she's cutting a new tooth near the back of her jaw.  Molar I guess.  So, now I know what caused the fever, and I know I can look forward to another week long fever episode soon - when the tooth on the other side starts.  My office space is almost done.  Its sort of miraculous how these men have managed to tear down walls and what-not and put up new walls and such.  Its like the bathroom never existed at all.  I should have my *new* desk and chair by next week and will move in then.  My ankle still hurts and is still slightly swollen.  Not 8-months-pregnant-swollen, but swollen nonetheless.  And I discovered a lovely bruise of deep deep purple just below my right ankle, which explains why this sprain hurt more than any other I can recall.  I thought I broke it, but no.  Just a sprain.  I'm getting caught up at work, and I've managed to sell 4 tickets to the  urlLink Cystic Fibrosis Miami Wine Opener  - only 96 more to go!  Let me know if you're interested in tickets - I've got plenty.  So, perhaps there is some progress, now that I step back and look at it all.  Not bad, Diva, not bad.  Diva out.

        So I'm NOT the only one...  while i've been out of the dating scene for a while now,  its nice to know that I wasn't alone in my  urlLink dating ethics .  As for my volleyballish ankle, we're hobbling along just fine today.  I've discovered that the only thing worse than a badly sprained ankle is the crutches they give you.  I decided that the crutches hurt more than the ankle, so i'm going without today.  I'm thinking a tall black umbrella may serve well as a cane.  It's really hard to look cool and graceful while limping with a swollen ankle.    Once again I've proven that my saving grace is my utter clumsiness.  Diva out.

       Better   Something about Autumn air makes me feel so good.  The air is sweeter, cooler, crisper.  And every breath I take in somehow loosens the binds around my heart.  I feel like I haven't taken a breath in months.  Maybe its the reduction in humidity.  Maybe there's some sort of sentimental value attached.  I don't know.  I just know that change is in the air, literally and it just makes me feel better.  Diva out.

       So Much to say  and not much time to say it.  So, here's the highlights.  A crew of 4 or 5 men is now building an office space for me.  Knocked down walls yesterday, now their doing i-don't-know-what making all kinds of noise.  I may do an audio blog later just to share the clatter.  As for audio blog... paypal sent them another payment.  Apparently I had subscribed without knowing, so now I have another 3 months of audblogs to make.  will probably start with the construction noise.  My oldest diva is now involved in the morning announcements at school.  I guess you could call her the production director?  she keeps everyone in order and makes sure who ever is next is ready to go.  I told her to think big - today the morning announcements tomorrow Hollywood!  The littest diva is sick - at home with grandma today.  Had a fever of 104 on Monday morning, but of course the doctor doesn't find any infections to cause the fever.  This too will pass.  Aside from that, there's not much else going on.  Actually there's so much more going on than I have time to tell you about here.  Gotta go, busy busy.  Diva out.

       Birthday Pampering  Is there anything better?  I decided on another thing that you should just pay for; pedicures.  I went on Saturday for a birthday pedi, and realized that I just don't do it like the pro's do.  There is really nothing like it, and I've made a birthday resolution to have a pedicure once a month.    Sunday I saw  La Traviatta  at Florida Grand Opera - another birthday pampering.  It was absolutely gorgeous - the costumes, the set, the music and the voices all combined to make my day very special.   I love opera, but how come the lady ALWAYS has to die at the end.  What is with that?  Struggle, suffer, try to live a proper life, make sacrifices for others... and die of some horrible disease or, even worse, by your own hand.  Makes a girl just want to go out and be bad!  My baby brother is in town this week for the holiday - baby brother is like 6'2" and football player big.  But he's still my baby brother.  Its nice to have someone around to play with my girls instead of just me for a change.  And, I'm just dying to tell you what else I did over the weekend, but propiety demands that I keep it clean.  Suffice it to say that I have an interesting new friend that sort of ensures that I will never die the death of an opera heroine *wink wink*.  Nuff said.  Diva out.

       FTAA in my 'hood   Last night, while attempting to get home, I had to sit in about 20 minutes of stop and go traffic.  It took that long for me to travel one block.  All I needed to do was make a right and then go to the light 1/2 a block away and make a left, to go around the closed road leading into Downtown Miami.  20 minutes.  And in that 20 minutes I saw maybe 30 cops in riot gear, guns and all.  A little unsettling, but all was quiet on the homefront, so I figured the unsettling presence was getting the job done.  4 helicopters overhead and a whole fleet of cop cars wasn't hurting matters any either.  Today, I find this article on FTAA, and realize THIS is what was going on.  The article mentions an organization that marched into Downtown Miami last night - I drove past their empty bus parked a block from my building.  History is being made and it is pulpable - you can sort of feel it in the humid 80 degree air.  And I am sitting right in the thick of it, boys and girls.   At least for 20 minutes or so at a time...  Diva out.

       I'm just a girl  Sometimes I forget that.  I had visions of grandeur this weekend as I walked through the aisles of the discount auto parts store.  I thought, "I can do this!"  I wanted to save money so I figured I could put oil and coolant into my car, change the air and oil filters, and pick up a steering wheel cover while I'm at it.  When I could barely get the damn cover to stretch over my steering wheel, having to pry my finger from between the cover and the wheel, I should have known I was already beaten.  What the HELL was I thinking?  I ended up forgoing the oil filter when I learned that I would need a special tool.  I tried to figure out where the rectangular air filter went in my engine, but I just couldn't do it.  On my old 70-something Toyota hatchback there was a big round space indicating where to put the filter.  My 98 Nissan isn't quite so revealing.  And for my final act, I put 2 quarts of oil and an oil additive into my engine.  Harmless enough, right?  Well, add that to the oil already in my engine (running very low but still in there) and the 2 quarts I added last weekend, and - ladies and gentlemen - we have a recipe for DISASTER!  I cranked up my car, gripped the squeaky new steering wheel cover between my fingers, and proceeded out of the garage for a Saturday night on the town.  Then, I noticed a black plume of heavy smoke being belched out of my exhaust.  It was so bad that the maintenance guys in my building came running, they thought the building was on fire.  Fortunately, I was able to *have someone else* drain the excess oil out and after a few miles on the highway this morning, the leftover oil througout the entrails of my car burned away and by the time I got to work there was no more billowing smoke from my tailpipe.  So, what have I learned from this adventure (as I always learn something from everything).    1.  I'm just a girl.  No matter how much I believe I can do just about everything, I can't. 2.  I know just enough about cars to get myself into some really big trouble. 3.  The dipstick is there for a reason. 4.  I'm NEVER doing that again. From now on, I will pay for any and all work on my poor little car.    Diva out.

       And for something different  I was making my way down the stairs this afternoon, and voila! I fell.  Again.  My slightly healed right ankle, which was really badly injured in my last fall, resulting in crutches, is now damaged all over again.  So, here I am, sitting at my desk starving since I haven't had lunch, with my ankle propped up on the garbage can waiting for someone to bring me ice.  My ankle is throbbing and swelling ever so slowly into a nice softball.  Again.  If nothing else, at least I'm consistent.  Diva out.

       Danger Will Robinson!  FTAA is coming.  And if anything can be gleened from  urlLink this website  then I think I'm for it.  I really don't understand any of the reasons given on this page for why it should be stopped.  But, then, I'm not really a global thinker, I'm more concerned with paying the rent and changing the oil in my car.  And I'm concerned about protecting my family from angry protestors as they converge on downtown Miami next week.  The elementary school has called a mandatory meeting tonight for parents, to discuss possible safety issues.  Anyone with a badge - state troopers to Fish & Game - will be on hand to control any possible out of control crowds during the protesting.  Even the Port of Miami is taking no chances - the port is closed next week and all ships have to use a port further north.  The protestors' headquarters is less than 15 blocks from my house.    I don't really know what this is all about, but I do know I'm not excited about it coming to Miami.  Diva out.

       Words I live by  Finally, someone has very clearly described exactly what I've been trying to explain to others for so very long.  Mostly I think the Dalai Lama is just a nice old man with scattered rambling thoughts - good, happy thoughts, but rambling.  This time, I must admit he's so very right.  "As long as there is a lack of the inner discipline that brings calmness of mind, no matter what external facilities or conditions you have, they will never give you the feeling of joy and happiness that you are seeking. On the other hand, if you possess this inner quality of calmness of mind, a degree of stability within, then even if you lack various external facilities that you would normally consider necessary for happiness, it is still possible to live a happy and joyful life."  -His Holiness the Dalai Lama  Diva out.

       Monday, Monday  Today started with the unparalleled joy of changing a flat tire.  I did it in less than 15 minutes, and managed to keep my clothes free of dirt and yuck.  And, luckily the tire was flat when I got into the car this morning.  It didn't go last night when I was driving home in the rain, or this morning when I would have been cruising along on the highway at 65 or 70.    So, while it was a bit of an inconvenience, it wasn't too bad.  Otherwise, I had a great weekend.  I participated in Hands on Miami Day and painted the boardwalk a new coat of brown.  Me and 299 other volunteers.  In all, the event attracted 3000 volunteers, with several projects throughout Miami and Miami Beach.  I even saw a few familiar faces, along with my team of 6 other coworkers.   Got a haircut, did a little shopping, and relaxed a little with a Sunday afternoon nap. Pics are going up in the diva gallery of our trick or treat outing.  In all, a pretty good weekend.     Diva out.

       Expanding on the last entry, Food for thought   Eliz commented, "According to my psychologist... it's a mental health problem that I have. *giggle... It's correctible -- assuming that I truly wish to change.  According to my psychiatrist... the truth lies within myself. She can have her opinion, BUT the truth of the matter depends on how I view it."  Makes me wonder about psychologists and therapists.  I mean, are we all supposed to be perfectly adjusted and balanced?  Are we all supposed to be free of any preferences or predisposed natures?  If the Drs. all had their way, we'd all be free of addictions, fears, anxieties, attitudes, truths and denials.    But, aren't those the things we bring with us into the world at large, that define us and motivate us?  Aren't those the very things we came into this world to learn from and to teach others about?    Eliz, your psychologist is right about one thing; the truth does lie within you.  Within all of us, as I believe.  And I am still wondering about my own personal koan right now, but not fretting too much over it.  And if I went back to MY therapist, I already know what HER opinion would be!  Because we've been through this one before ;)  Diva out.

       Food for thought  On another note, let me ask you, dear reader, for your opinion.    If something continues to present itself, a recurring habit or theme keeps returning, does that make it karma, destiny, or perhaps just a bad habit?  Example: You're no good at saving money.  You try and try: you open savings accounts, CDs, 401(k), etc etc.  But no matter what, you just don't save.  Or, you diet and exercise, but you just can't keep off the weight.  Or, no matter how hard you try to plan ahead, procrastination conquers all.  See what I mean? Nothing terribly bad, just some little habit that you've tried to break, a pattern in your life that you've tried to change, and it just keeps coming back.  Deja vu, over and over again.  So, I repeat the question: Is is karma, fate, destiny?  Or just a bad habit?  Is it the pattern and design of your life, something that should be aknowledged and accepted, or a flaw of character to be shunned and overcome?  What is your opinion, dear reader?  Of course I have my own curious scenario presenting itself right now, and I would appreciate your input.  So, use that little comment link for all its worth!  Diva out.

      And what bothers me most of all is that my boss never ever gives me ANYTHING for Christmas.  He's a great guy, but he's really very insensitive when it comes to the holiday gift-giving thing.

       HoLiDaY uPs AnD dOwNs   Yeah, I'm still in a bit of a funk over the whole holiday thing.  It's very unlike me, which only means that it won't last.  I was reminded in reading last night to "live in the moment."  To breathe in, and then out, and to live in the space between each breath.  If you can let go of the exhale, and not anticipate the inhale, then you are living in the moment.  It was a good reminder, and it's helping me today.  That, and the good news of an old friend who is visiting for the holidays.  We're going to do a little holiday shopping in Downtown Miami tomorrow - you know, guerilla-warfare shopping for Christmas Eve.  Everything you need is Downtown.  So, I have the day off tomorrow to take care of the myriad tasks ahead of me, and I will spend a few hours with a very dear friend.  I have something to look forward to, and that makes me happy.  Even without the breathing.    Diva out.

       Let the festivities begin  I went to my Employee Holiday Party last night, and danced my ass off.  Everyone commented, both last night and this morning, on how much I danced.  I love to dance.  In fact, I danced so much that now my kneecaps hurt.   What the hell is that about?   Any way, in case you're interested, you can check out pics  urlLink here .  It was the first party we'd had in two years, and we sure did make up for lost time.  I left at midnight, but as I was leaving the conference services manager had just convinced the DJ to play longer.  I have no idea when that party ended, but when I left it was no where near winding down.  What a great night!    And, that stupid effing bond payment has finally been sent to the disbursement unit to be released to me as payment for outstanding child support.  DBD was picked up the first weekend in August; I may actually get his bail bond just before Christmas.  I think I see shopping in my near future.

       Something new  I've never had this reaction before, and it has really left me feeling very disturbed and upset.  I was sitting at lunch just now, minding my own business.  Suddenly a santa hat was thrust upon me, and an order to say something holiday-ish into the video cam for the staff party.  I was caught very unawares, and very unprepared.  And, I'm really not feeling it.  I joked, telling them I'll just "say 'Bah humbug', because I'm just not feeling it."    My co-worked improvised a very merry holiday greeting into the camera lens, and then all eyes were on me to perform likewise.  I couldn't.  I told them to get me later, because I wasn't ready.  Then I had to get up and leave the cafeteria.  I was too upset to stay.  I knew I wasn't in the mood, but I didn't realize how NOT in the mood I am.  It's a week away, and then it will be all over.  Soon, this will all be over.  Diva out.

       Diva is back  I've actually managed to get caught up on my workload here in the office.  *sssshh, don't tell my boss!* So, I can give you, my dearest reader, a little update on the weekend.  A friend from NY left the artic north for a little frolicking in the balmy Miami sunshine.  I am so glad when we can spend time together, he's the only other person I know who likes to just walk around and check things out. (Besides my brother, that is).  We strolled along Ocean Drive and Washington Ave, Lincoln Road and all across Downtown Miami - in just one afternoon!    Went to see The Last Samurai, and despite the vivid battle scenes - I hate blood, guts and violence - I really loved it.  It was so visually beautiful and so emotionally stirring.  Sometimes, the actors didn't have to say anything, the looks and actions expressed all that was intended.  And, as my friend pointed out, they didn't have Japanese villagers speaking English to each other.  They spoke Japanese, with English subtitles.  After all, why would they speak English to EACH OTHER?  It was well done, and I am really glad I got to see it.    OK, off my movie review soapbox.   As for the Holiday looming in the not-far-enough future, I say "BAH HUMBUG!"  I have to fix my car's CV Joint and replace a rear tire - my third flat tire in less than 3 months - and I haven't  even started  my shopping.  Then there's all those holiday cards that are being received here at the hotel which just makes for more mail for me to open.  More work for me, delaying me from updating my blog.  And don't even get me started on the whole tree thing.  If I buy a real one *uh-oh.  I've started myself on this* If I buy a real tree, I'll have to haul the thing down to the dumpster in about 10 days, thereby wastefully disposing of a natural resource.  And the money spent on buying a tree could otherwise be spent on presents - assuming I ever get to buy any.  If I buy a fake tree, I'll have to hoard the damn thing in a closet for a year, again using money and taking up valuable space in an already crowded closet.     urlLink I'm thinking bamboo tree again this year.    Although, I am beginning to have the holiday spirit.  I'm hosting a Wine Club "Holiday Sparkle" event tomorrow night - featuring champagnes ~ ooo la la - and on Thursday I have the hotel's holiday party to attend.   Trust me, no one parties like hotel people, so it should be a really good party.  Then Friday, my little diva will be performing in a holiday show.    Besides that, carols keep playing in my head against my will and my own better judgement.  So, you know, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  *ha ha now that damn song will be playing in YOUR head too!*  Your welcome.  Diva out.

       Voracious  Reader, that is.  Well, that and other things... *wink, wink*  I mentioned to a friend yesterday that I would like to borrow his copy of Hilary Clinton's "Living History" just as soon as I finish the three books I'm currenlty reading.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  "Three books?  You're reading three books?"  Yeah. I'm reading three books.  Actually, I've only started two of them. As I am almost finished with the one I started on Saturday, I'll probably move further along in my second one, and pick up the third one sometime soon.  I can't help it.  I don't watch TV, I read.  And if you're not new to my blog, you probably understand that I cover a wide genre of literature - but mostly I just read dead people.  Classic literature and philosophy.  So, I'm reading about the paradox of sex and spirituality (which has actually interested me in a few other authors like Henry Miller and Walt Whitman) and I'm reading Jane Eyre, which I bought on my summer road trip but just haven't thought to read yet.  Next is the Accident Buddhist - which I'm figuring will be my life story! - and then I'll borrow Hilary's book.    Oh, but wait.  She's not dead.   Can I read that?  Yeah, for Hilary I can break a rule or two, heh heh.  Diva out.

        urlLink Your Diva turned 34 on Sunday!    I always thought 33 would be an amazing year.  A year of enlightenment.  When I turned 33, I figured, "Ok.  Jesus and Buddha both discovered their true natures, found themselves if you will, at 33, right?"  (Right?)   And if they can do it, so can I; hopefully without an actual crucifixion or ascension.  No blood or anything, just enlightenment.  A little pain will be okay, but not too much, thank you very much.  And I was right.  What a year it has been.  Joy and pain.  I've discovered much about myself while I was 33, and much of it ended up on this blog.  And I think I'm better for it.  Thanks to all of my blog readers who keep coming back for more *god only knows why you do*.  34, here we come! :)  Diva out.

       Screw up bird   Apparently, yesterday was my day to be that screw up bird making the left instead of the right. *groan*  Although I've been milling it all over in my head, fearing retribution, and convincing myself that I can live quite comfortably on unemployment, a few random acts of kindness today are helping to remind me that it's all my own perception.   My screw ups and fears are so big because they're all in my head.  Nobody else seems to be carrying around yesterday's drama but me.    So, I'm going to shake it off and move on.  Friends can be so good to you without even knowing it.  Diva out.

       Things I ponder   First of all, I discovered a "hidden racism" yesterday.    I'm catergorized as Caucasian.  My children are considered Hispanic.  Simply because I had the audacity to mix my Euro-American blood with *gasp* someone with a Latin American heritage, our children are now considered Hispanic.  Why not Caucasian?  Why not Hispanic/Causcasion, or, alphabetically, Caucasian/Hispanic?  It's the "man" trying to keep my girls down!  Another, completely unrelated, pondering:  ever watch a flock of birds fly in circles together?  They fly to and fro, from one corner of the sky to another, in total unison, and then back to the first space, and around again.  How do they know when to turn, which way to turn?     And, is there ever a poor little screw-up bird that keeps going left when he's supposed to be going right?  Things that make you go, "Hmmmmm."   (I know, it's pretty scary being in my head, isn't it?!)  Diva out.

       Done  I filed my taxes today.  Yes, that's right.  I filed my taxes today.  My 2003 taxes are filed and I should have my refund in my bank account in a week or two.  It's like magic.  I love e-file.   So, while the rest of you are still fumbling through drawers for receipts and what-not, I'll be spending my refund.  Mostly on bills, of course, and that still-needed car repair; but I do have my eye on one of those DVD/VCR combo deals.  Our VCR died a few weeks ago, and I think I'm going to splurge a little.  I feel pretty darn good.  Diva out.

       In the 'tweens   Any parent who's ever lived through a child being the ages of 10 to 12 know exactly what I'm getting at here.  My oldest little diva is 10.  She will be 11 in March.  She's what marketers call a "tween" - not a child, not a teen.  And with her coveted marketing demographic come many little quirks.    One of these quirks is that, in public spaces, I am now "Mom".  The first time she called me by that moniker, I didn't realize it was my own child calling for her mother.  I'm not "Mom", I'm "Mommy".  So, I didn't bother to look up.  Then, I realized it was her voice calling, so I responded with a small amount of discord.  It just didn't feel right.    Now I've grown more accustomed to this grown-up public version of my daughter.  To me, it indicates a small amount of embarassment to her to cling to childhood things.  Things like good-bye kisses, hello hugs and needing her "Mommy".  But last night as I walked her, half-asleep, from my bed to hers, she mumbled a sweet, "Good night, Mommy," and all was right in the world again.  In the safety of her own home, without the danger of "tween" on-lookers, I am still "Mommy".  Diva out.

       Right under my nose  You know how you can spend days, or even weeks, looking for something?  Then, you find it right in front of you?  I had one of those experiences.  I have been looking all over the place - online searching, magazine listings, related websites - trying to find somewhere to learn meditation ~ Tibetan Buddhist Meditation (this is where anyone who knows me for any length of time starts to freak out).  I searched high and low for a place to meditate, to learn how to really do it right.  I've been looking now for more than 2 weeks, and everywhere I turned, there was either a disconnected phone number or a dead e-mail address.  Apparently, Buddhists don't cling to communication ;)  I knew that the pastor at my church offered a meditation session on Monday nights, and I finally had a chance to check that out this Monday.  No school, no kids to pick up after work.  So, I went.  To my methodist church with my female pastor leading the sesshin, I had my very first guided Tibetan Buddhist mindfulness mediation.  It was all I had been looking for - and it was right there in front of me every Sunday on the church program.  Under my nose, literally.  Funny how things work out.  Diva out.

       munday  although not quite such a monday, since today is a holiday.  MLK day may not be everyone's holiday, but it does quiet the phones and ease up on the e-mail.  i was able to get a lot done, so in addition to all he's already done, "thanks, Dr. King!"  had a faaaabulous south beach weekend.  this was the annual art deco weekend - an art festival featuring lots of art deco period art, furniture, posters, jewelry and other miscellaneous things.  and, for the first time in a long time, street performers were legally able to entertain the throngs.  i must admit it did add to the flavor of the event.  i even saw the "naked cowboy" - i think it was THE naked cowboy, from NY.  Sure looked like the pictures i've seen.  i'm thinking the single digit weather up there may have chased him down here.  its gotta be tough picking a guitar in your skivvies with a negative degree wind chill!  also saw the movie cheaper by the dozen - very cute.  no matter how many kids you have, they will love it, and so will you.    also checked out the new  urlLink Miami Childrens Museum .  not a bad way to spend a stormy sunday afternoon.  kept the kids entertained for a good 3 hours, and we could have stayed longer if the grown ups in the group didn't have other things to do.  in all, it was a very good two days.  quality time with the diva-ettes was much needed.  hope my reader had a great two days too!  diva out.

             I am The Empress    The Empress can refer to any aspect of Motherhood. She can be an individual mother, but as a major arcana card, she also goes beyond the specifics of mothering to its essence - the creation of life and its sustenance through loving care and attention. The Empress can also represent lavish abundance of all kinds. She offers a cornucopia of delights, especially those of the senses - food, pleasure and beauty. She can suggest material reward, but only with the understanding that riches go with a generous and open spirit. The Empress asks you to embrace the principle of life and enjoy its bountiful goodness.  For a full description of your card and other goodies, please visit  urlLink LearnTarot.com         What tarot card are you?  Enter your birthdate.  Month:   Day:   Year:          I "borrowed" this from  urlLink Steph , who "snitched from Asherah & various other blogs but the links don't seem to be working correctly so try heading to http://www.obeythefist.com/tarot/ and entering your birthdate there."  It worked pretty well for me.  Diva out.

       Finally a list I can relate to!   YOU MIGHT BE IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY IF . . . .   1. You sat at the same desk for 4 years and worked for 8 different managers.   2. "Going for cocktails and dinner" is NOT your idea of a nice evening.   3. When someone asks you your exact job profile, you lie.   4. You get really excited about a 2% pay increase.   5. You sit in a cubicle smaller than your bedroom closet.   6. It's dark on your drive to and from work.   7. Communication is something your "group" is having problems with.   8. You see a good-looking person and know it's a visitor/guest.   9. Food left over from a banquet / meeting is your main staple.   10. You forget what you look like in anything but a suit.   11. All the work you were hired to do gets done before 9 and after 5..   12. You're already late on the assignment you just received.   13. You boss's favorite lines are . . .  a. "When you get a few minutes . . . ."  b. "In your spare time ...... "  c. "I have an opportunity for you . . . ."   14. 50% of the people in your company do not know what you do   15. The other 50% of the people in your company do not care what you do   16. Vacation is something you roll-over to next year or a check you get every January.   17. Change is the norm.   18. Nepotism is encouraged.   19. You read this entire list and understand it.  Diva out.

       Resolutions  I finally came up with a few resolutions for the new year.  Took me while.  And no, giving up on procrastinating isn't one of them!  I've decided to start painting again.  To honor my creative spirit, as it were.  Surprisingly, my oldest little diva was very pleased with this decision.    I'm sure I had others, but I really can't remember them right now.  Another was to get my weight down another 3lbs and keep it there a while.  What was that other one?  I'm having a Dory moment right now, so I'll have to add it in later.  I've heard that if you share a goal with others, you're more likely to keep it.  So, consider yourself as "others".  Diva out.

And I called the State Disbursement unit about that effing bond payment that's been sitting in the state's account since 12/18.  Apparently, the revenue department needed a little nudge from me.  Now things should move along smoothly enough.  I may get my hands on that $$ before the end of this month. *maybe*   Didn't I have to do that the LAST time I was expecting money from the state?  *sigh*    Anyway, tomorrow's payday.

Some were so boring, there weren't even 24 pics to be had.  At least I had something to take pictures of.  And I had to edit them down to one per hour.  Lots of people went to dinner parties at friends' houses - I'm thinking that might be a nice change for next year's festivities.    Lots of people had lots of fun and lots of alcohol.  In all, I think it was a very successful evening, collectively. ;)  Happy New Year again, everyone!  Diva out.

       Life is good    I had this whole other entry thought up on how great our new "Dora the Explorer" alarm clock is, but something just happened that merits entry.  I had resigned myself to the fact that I would need to borrow $10 for gas today.  I managed to scrounge up $2 in change last night, but decided that it just wouldn't be enough.  Now I am on "E" just waiting for that little idiot light to come on.    So, I was just waiting for a friend to come in so I could ask him to borrow the money.  Then I get a call from our Concierge Desk, telling me that a guest needs a document notarized.  The charge for this task is exactly $10.  :)  Now I don't need to borrow money (something I really hate to do) as I have earned it instead.  Life is good and the Universe never ceases to amaze me in its gifts.  There's another gift I am hoping to receive very soon, but I'm afraid to write about it just now.  When it happens, you'll be the first to know.    The universe has a crappy sense of humor.  The guy stiffed me on the notary fee. He checked out and never came back to pay me.  Creep.

       Feeling Much Better    the holidays have passed, and life is back to normal.  Kids are in school and everyone is back in the office. *BIG sigh of relief*  and, as i have had to wait 5 months for that bail bond payment from waaaaay back in August, and am still waiting, i have come to realize something.  i have allotted that money to everything from rent, to long overdue bills, to paying back debts to friends that lent me money, to buying christmas presents.  oh, and repairing my car.  in the meantime, some of those bills have somehow been paid without receiving that money.  christmas gifts were bought.  well, the car still needs repairing.  but i'm still waiting.  now the circus is coming and i want to take my girls, and the car still needs repairing.  there are so many new ways to spend that money, and yet, somehow, even without the money i've managed to keep moving.    i can't help but see the lesson in all of this.  although i would have preferred to have had a check instead of a lesson, my own nature finds yet another way to be grateful for what i haven't got (yet).

       Rizzn's fault  I checked  urlLink rizzn's page , and his protest on another blog's comments on the whole gay marriage thing got me thinking (damn him).  I heard a comment on NPR last night, where Bush said something about history proving that marriage between a man and woman is best (or something like that).  I tried to find the quote online today, to be all professional and correct and stuff, but I figured I'd just forge on ahead without it.  Everytime I hear that man speak, I think to myself, "What the hell is he thinking?"  On the surface, he seems to share the same ideas, thoughts and beliefs of the common "good american".  You know, the right wing, republican, christian upbringing, tons on money in the bank common american.  Unfortunately, I don't think he goes any deeper than the surface.  I also don't think he goes any further than the imaginary borders of this country.    I wonder what impact these 4 years will have on the next 20, the next 50, the next 200.  In my great grandchildren's history books, will he be a Truman, or a Nixon?  Will there be another 4 years of him?  Does he ever wonder this too?  His actions and thoughts impact everyone, presently and years into the future.  With any luck, the issues brought forward in his presidency - family, health, money, religion, war - will inspire future leaders to move ahead with less personal agendas.  It is good to talk about what he has brought into the limelight.  It is good to debate over what works and doesn't work.    The critical thinking being done now about so many issues will, in the end, have some impact on how we think, act, plan, marry, spend, work, live.    Then I wonder, did the Romans, the Greeks, the Aztecs do it any better than we are right now?  Diva out.

       Diva in training  In true diva spirit, I took my oldest little diva to her very first Opera on Friday night.   It was "Romeo et Juliette", performed in French by the  urlLink Florida Grand Opera .    This was an early birthday present for her, as she turns 11 next month.  I was a little concerned that, being only 10, she may get a little bored.   After all, this is a long one, at 3 hours and 15 minutes - with 2 intermissions.  She donned a new outfit - black skirt, white blouse with sparkly brooch; she did up her hair, put on a little lip gloss and selected an evening bag.  Topped off with my black wrap, she looked as if she'd always gone to the Opera.  She sat perched on the edge of her seat for many scenes, my opera glasses at the end of nose, peering alternately at the stage and the English translations.  I was so proud of her, and so glad that I was able to expose her to something that I think is just wonderful.  She agreed with me; it is something wonderful and she said she really liked it.   She's already selected at least two operas from next season that she would like to see.  Ah, my little diva is growing up.  Diva out.

       About my yoga  Some weeks back, someone visited my site and requested that I blog about my yoga practice.  Not sure why, and when I said I would blog about my practice, I never really was sure that I would.    But, lately my practice has increased and, combined with my meditation practice, I am beginning to see some changes in how I do what I do ~ at least in yoga anyway.  I've started getting up earlier, like around 6:30 (without an alarm clock - does this mean I'm getting older?); I'm up with the sun for some strange reason.  Sometimes I just roll over and snooze for another hour, but more often I am getting up and rolling out my yoga mat.  The mornings are harder for me than the evenings.  I'm stiff and sore and weak and hungry.  But by the third or fourth sun salutation, I'm better.  I only get through the standing half of the asthanga practice - normally about 20 or 30 minutes worth.  Then I'm primed and ready for the day, with a bit more energy and optimism than expected.  Evenings are better for me.  I can really get deep into the practice when the girls are asleep.  I can hear my breathing and feel the muscles stretching, feel the vibrations that come when I'm in certain positions.  And, now with meditation added to the practice, I realize even more that yoga is a moving meditation.  Sitting with my eyes closed or staring out into space, my body remembers what movement is like.  Moving through an asana, my mind remembers what spaciousness is.    It is strange, and maybe I'm the only one who will ever understand this entry.  But, I was asked to write about it, and its part of my experience.  And, let's face it ~ this  is   my  blog.  Diva out.

       Keepin' it real  V-Day seems to not be a total disappointment.  Since I am in the office today working on resaurant menus, I got invited to the Valentines Dinner by the F&B Director.  A friend and I will be dining for free on lobster tail and tenderloin.  Not bad, even if my date will be just a female friend of mine.  And, they say good friends help to keep you real.  At least, somebody said it, because I know I've heard it before.  Last night I got together with a few friends from high school; some I hadn't seen in years, some I see (or at least read) pretty regularly.  I think I must have changed quite a lot in the past  *&^%$ years.  We were reminisicing over high school antics, what they did and how I would stand over their shoulder telling them why they shouldn't.    I was their "Jiminy Cricket", their conscience.    And, I never wanted to drive on the interstate in my little white hyundai.  I'm wondering, was I annoying?  Was I so meek and mild mannered that I was afraid to have fun?  And, more importantly, WHY DON'T I REMEMBER BEING LIKE THAT?   I don't remember playing the conscience to all of my friends.  I don't remember doing half of what they say I did.  I did get into the same mischief my friends did, "guilty by association" as someone put it last night.  I remember having fun and doing silly things (much of it I really can't discuss here, to protect the innocent).  heh-heh.  I don't know why I don't remember being who they said I was.  They made me sound like, I don't know, a nag, a conscience, a party-pooper... "you really shouldn't do that, its not very nice."    But, they let me play with them anyway.  They let me hang out, even when I didn't drink their liquid lunches with them, and I didn't shoot m&m's at passers-by in the hallways, and I  swear  i do not recall EVER throwing citrus at pedestrians, or plucking them from a tree.  Although, maybe I do have a slight recollection of picking fruit late at night...    Anyway, for whatever reasons my friends allowed me to be their friends, I am grateful.  Grateful for teaching me freedom to be myself, and freedom to just cut loose once in awhile.  Last night was a gift for Fred, but I reaped some of those rewards as well.

       Couldn't have said it better myself   "You are more.  Even the most intense experience is only an experience you are having. It is not you, and you are not it.  You are more than your problems, more than your possessions, more than the pains and pleasures. You are more than the frustrations that sometimes feel so overwhelming.  Too often, out of fear, you cling tightly to things that don't really matter. Imagine the freedom that can come from letting go and stepping back.  What if your most agonizing worries no longer had the power to worry you? What if your most burdensome difficulties no longer had the power to trouble you?  Step back from them, and it is all possible. It's not a matter of running away, but of putting the world in perspective.  The real person you are, is not defined or limited by the passing circumstances, no matter how intense they may be. Always remember that you are more."  -- Ralph Marston  Diva out.

       Happy Birthday, Mr. President    And in the end, it's not the years in your life that count. It's the life in your years.  -  Abraham Lincoln  Yeah, I have a thing for tall, wiry, overwhelmingly compassionate men.  I'd sing to him in a dress - of course, considering his era, it would be much less revealing and I somehow imagine it would be thick and scratchy.

       Timing is everything  I have my share of good days and bad days.  But for 2 days in a row, I've managed to be in the right place at the right time.    Right around 11am, they pull the breakfast buffet from the restaurant. Warm chafing dishes half-filled with crispy, savory hour-old bacon and grease-filled crispy-on-the-outside, juicy-on-the-inside fat little sausages.  Left overs from what has been picked over since 6:30 this morning by hotel guests with more time and money on their hands than they know what to do with.    My cholesterol has probably spiked high from my recent good fortune; but, man! how a little bacon and sausage can make the day go oh-so good.  Diva out.

       2 tragedies in 2 days in Florida  After seeing the news this morning, I realize that I need to sit my girls down and have a serious talk tonight.  Everyone probably knows by now about the missing 11 year old girl in Sarasota.  Luckily, they have the abduction on tape somehow, so they know who did it.   Sadly, the abductor isn't being very cooperative, so the girl is still missing.   Something you may not have heard about is the murder of a 14 year old boy by classmate in a South Florida school.  One 14 year old boy cut the throat of another 14 year old boy in the school bathroom early Tuesday morning.  While the boy has admitted to the crime, the motive has not yet been established.  These are the things parents dread and fear.  Horrific stories of brutality that you wouldn't bare to hear happening to an adult, much less a child.  And we all think we are impervious to such assaults.   That could never happen to my child.  My child is too smart for that to happen to him/her.   * Tell your child to never go near or into a stranger's car.   * Tell your child to scream, yell, blow a whistle, make as much noise as possible.  Even if the stranger threatens to hurt them if they make noise - be as loud as they can. * Even if the stranger has a gun, run away.  Either the person won't bother to shoot, or if they do shoot, and by some luck actually hit you, you're still better off bleeding in public where someone can help you. * Grab onto something bigger than you and don't let go for anything.  If you're holding onto your bike, a big stick, a telephone pole, whatever, you won't fit into the person's car. *Don't try to help an adult who is a stranger.  You can find an adult you know to help the stranger, but don't do it by yourself. * 911 is a free call.  As soon as you get away, dial it.  The cops will find you no matter where you are as long as you stay by that payphone.  And for school, these rules may have to apply to other students unfortunately.  Its hard to know if your child is being bullied at school.  But, you have to talk about it.  It's the only way to really know what's going on there.  They spend anywhere from 5 to 8 hours there every weekday, and you really need to know what's happening to your child.  These are the things I'm going to tell my very smart daughters tonight.   And then I'm going to hug them very very tightly.  Diva out.

       Soapbox   **Diva unassumingly places her soapbox in the middle of blogdom, then quietly steps up onto her little soapbox.  She opens her mouth to speak.**   Here's my two cents on the whole Janet Jackson boob thing.    At any given time on any given day and on any given channel on TV ('cept maybe Disney  *she mumbles with uncertainty *) you can find women being beaten, pushed, pulled, dragged and raped - with all sorts of body parts showing.  Why is it that, when a woman chooses to show off a part of her own on her own, the networks go crazy?   What, you think your 7 year old isn't watching MTV?  Ever caught an hour or two of Sunday afternoon TNT?    And, apparently the US is the only country bothered by the whole thing.  BBC and other world networks never even bothered to cut away from the incident.  It was the Puritan Americans, with all their family values, that shut their viewers eyes to the shame of a woman's body.  A woman's body that wasn't being manipulated and controlled by their programming.   **Diva lets forth a heavy sigh, then respectfully steps down from her soapbox.  Quietly picks up said soapbox wondering what comments this will evoke, and shuffles away, out of view (and hopefully out of range).**   Diva out.

       Tangled Mind  First of all, it was intentional.  I don't buy for one second that the costume malfunctioned.  Janet's a freak, period, end of statement.  Now that that's out of the way...  Realization Number 1: While walking through the sun-drenched streets of South Beach on my lunch break, just barely breaking a sweat in the balmy 68 degrees (are you jealous yet?), I realized that no matter how tough life can be, I always carry a little bit of joy in me.  Realization Number 2: The art to a sexy walk is never looking like you're in a hurry.  You may very well be in a hurry, but your walk should not indicate this.  As long as, with every step, you feel the stride and enjoy the sound of your heel on the pavement, and move into the next long stride, you will be sexy.  Damnit.   Realization Number 3: Weird, misguided thought number 1: While making my way back from my lunch break walk, a man on the street sneezed really loud.  REALLY LOUD.  Echoing through the streets and alleys loud.  Everyone stopped in their tracks to look.  He moved on, and then sneezed again a moment later.  Twisted thought crossed my mind: Is he that loud in bed?  Then my mind meandered to last night, when I heard my neighbors from what must have been a kitchen romp.  Deep throaty moans with an even amount of time between each of them.  At the time, I just wanted to get my little diva into our apartment so I wouldn't have to explain the sounds coming from behind the other door.  But, today my mind wandered back to the sounds.  Such nice sounds.    Maybe they were listening to a Janet Jackson CD after having watched the game.  Diva out.

       More Diva for your Dollar   Despite my fabulous pseudonym and glamorous locale, it may surprise you, dear reader, to learn that Im not actually all that much of a diva.  I mean, I do get to a salon more than some single moms, and I definitely take very good care of myself.  But, in all, Im more of a regular girl a simple girl with simple needs.  In fact, I havent really done much shopping in a very long time. Of course, with the new influx of child support dollars, Ive been able to get out a little more to get the things all three divas in my household require.  Ive gone a little crazy  new towels, shoes for my diva-ettes, even a new set of pjs for the little one.  I know, I know; out of control.  And I have managed to acquire a little slice of heaven in the form of a Victorias Secret credit card.  Man-oh-man could a diva get herself into trouble with this one!  I made a little visit to my local VS store on Saturday.  At first, after not shopping for so long, I was a little ambivalent.  The store was buzzing with young hotties and their bashful boyfriends, as well as a few almost middle-aged mothers, dragging their children along behind them.  And there was me.    Did you know that they have a lady in the dressing room to measure you????  Did you know that all the salespeople walk around with headsets, chatting back and forth to each other: Hi sweetie, can you get me a 34D, black?  Are you free to assist?    What is with that?  How urgent can it be?  I almost felt guilty for NOT letting someone help me pick out just the right bra.  Sheesh.  But it was quite an experience, and a very nice one at that.  And, I am now the proud diva owner of 2!, yes 2! New VS bras.  I have cleavage  who knew.  Now more diva than ever.  Diva out.

       I (heart) Yoga   I was able to go to a yoga class last night for the first time in more than a year.  Ive been practicing at home, but, well you know.  I get in 30 or 40 minutes of practice, and then call it a night.  And, as hard as I may try to correct my posture and get deeper into a pose its just me.    Like trying to learn how to drive a car by reading an owners manual.  Without the practice and a good teacher, you can only get so far.  Last night, I had the teacher and I had the class around me.  The teacher checked my posture and helped me to get a little deeper into my down dog.  He reminded me to be mindful of my movements, my thoughts and my breathing.  Seeing the other class members working so hard inspired me to get through the class, to do that last Sun Salutation B (I usually only do 1 or 2).  Seeing the others work past their own abilities, stretching themselves into unfamiliar postures, encouraged me to go even deeper into the ones I know so well.  And I did a few arm balances that Ive never done before.  Eventually, after headstand, the teacher had to encourage me to rest, as I had been working like a dog  his words.  My effort was evident, and even I was surprised at having made it to the end of the class without giving up.  Of course, I had a hard time holding on to my steering wheel while driving home.  My body ached all night (and still does) with the effort of getting through that class.  But, in addition to the ache, I feel a strong sense of accomplishment and strength.  I feel that Ive opened up some parts of my body that had closed up again after so long without a class.    And I am reminded once again why I love yoga so much; I am constantly amazed at how I keep proving myself wrong  I can do this.  I can make it.  I am stronger than I will ever believe I am.  Yoga pushes me further and proves to me my limitless abilities even as my doubting mind tries to deny it all.    We are all stronger than we know.  Diva out.

       Gorgeous Spring Weather  It may still be winter up north, with temperatures low enough to make snow, but here the weather is just gorgeous.  There's nothing like a blustery Spring morning in Miami to bring a smile to my face.  69 degrees this morning, with a strong, cool breeze blowing through me.  I couldn't help but smile.  I love the feeling of the wind on my skin.  Now, if it would just rain.  With all the wind, my car is covered with sand and oceanspray.  I don't wash my car, I just wait for a good rain.  But, of course we all know, it never rains until you wash your car.  See my dilemma?  Diva out.

       Random bits & pieces  First off, I think I may have figured out a way to fit yoga AND meditation into my daily schedule.  I've been working in one or the other for the past few weeks, and my yoga is really suffering.  Last night, I managed to do both before bedtime, and it felt great.  So, I'm putting both on my daily agenda; now if only my little diva-ettes will cooperate by going to bed on time...  I took my now 11 year old diva-ette, along with 5 other 10-11 year old girls, to see Hidalgo on Saturday night.  No, it wasn't penance for my sins, it was a birthday party for my daughter.  It was a lot of fun actually, and I really enjoyed the movie on many levels.  There were some subliminal messages that I got from it, like comparing the "Arabians" to the American Indians, and the lack of knowledge about the culture creating hatred for that culture.  And, finding yourself, being true to yourself... so many levels to appreciate.  The girls liked the horses. :p  And, they've installed monitoring software on the internet here at work, so that may mean fewer installations.  I know... I know... you're wondering how will you ever live  without your diva.  But, have no fear, dear reader.  I'm working on getting internet at home (which will probably end up being monopolized by the above-mentioned 11 year old).  So, when I should be doing my down-dogs, I may end up blogging instead.  And, one last note; I saw two things downtown on Saturday morning that I've never seen before.  Not counting the new farmer's market, I saw several "Help Wanted" signs in shop windows, and I saw an overhead construction walkway, encompassing one whole street corner.  To me, these are indicators of growth in the area.  Downtown hasn't seen growth in many many years.  It was just a place to get the occasional bargain, but never considered a serious business/shopping/entertainment area.  With new businesses, growth in current businesses, new construction of housing; Downtown is fast becoming a really great place to live.  Diva out.

       Gotta' give credit...  where credit is due.  For two weeks, consecutively, I have received child support payments.  DBD is now gainfully employed, and therefore, no longer a DBD.    He's paying, he calls to say hello, he's visiting this weekend and planning some quality time with his girls.  He's doing the right thing now.    I'm going to have to come up with some new moniker, or maybe I'll just stop writing about it altogether.  All is well, and the drama is gone.  *Big sigh of relief*  And thanks to the new support, I managed to have a whole $12 in my account on the day before payday.  That hasn't happened in a long, long time.  Life is good.  Diva out.

       Refreshing point of view  While at lunch today with someone slightly older and, perhaps wiser, than me, the issue of gay marriage flashed across the TV screen again.    He reminded me:  30 years ago, a black man couldn't use the same toilet as a white man.  It was considered "fundamentally wrong", and segration was "right".    Less than 100 years ago, women couldn't vote in this country.  It was unheard of, and well, "fundamentally wrong".    Maybe 20 years from now, gay marriage will have moved into the realm of desegregation and suffrage.  Something that just had to be allowed, because how could it possibly be otherwise?

       Bark!  I can only guess what Fred's going to say about this one... but here goes.  I started taking an herbal extract on Sunday.  Its supposed to help stimulate my metabolism and assist my body in using the fat I've stored around my lower abdomen, hips and thighs.  Its taken from the bark of a tree that grows wild in Cameroon, Africa.  The drops are dark dark dark brown, and I have to put 30 to 40 drops into a glass of water, then drink it.  Someone asked me how it tastes, I told him it takes like I'm licking a tree.  It tastes like bark.  But, since I started taking it, I've noticed an increase in my energy level, a decrease in my apetite and I haven't wanted (or had any) coffee for two days now.   There's that little note on the bottle saying that the FDA hasn't acknowledged the claims for the product.  Funny, though, that there's a warning for some people with certain health conditions to avoid taking the product.  If it doesn't work, why should they have to warn some people about it?  All I know is I want to drop 10 lbs by the time I go to Boston in July and if I can do it with this bark drink, then bottoms up!  Diva out.

       Overdue Update  Well, dear reader, needless to say I don't have internet at home - STILL.  Apparently my PC doesn't have enough RAM *sigh*... story of my life.  Working on it though, so have no fear.  Eventually, I will be able to inundate you relentlessly with unimportant details of my overwhelmingly fabulous life.  I think I must have swallowed a thesaurus with my morning coffee.  Let's see... unimportant details... well, first off I have been reminded of why I don't lay out on the beach, and why I do wear sunblock when I do get out into the brilliant South Florida sunshine.  Think of the brightest, reddest overcooked lobster you have ever seen, and that will give you an idea of what my right thigh and right upper arm look like today.  I carefully covered SOME parts of me with sunblock, heedlessly leaving way too much of me unprotected.  I have little red slivers of sunburn on my butt, since I thought it would be good to sun my buns a little yesterday... not the whole thing, but you know... a little more than is normally covered by my bathing suit.    Sitting, sleeping, walking, breathing... yep, they all pretty much hurt today.  And, as I am pretty sure he doesn't read this, I can tell you all that my online friend from NY has now moved to Sunny South Florida.  That's why I'm sunburnt today; he's busy soaking in the new, more relaxed lifestyle that we enjoy here.  Lounging on the beach on a Sunday afternoon was part of the initiation of local status.  Yummy Argentinian food on Saturday night - grilled chicken and sausage, sauteed spinach and some kind of a flambe'd dessert with caramel-filled crepes was another part of that initiation.  Peruvian and Colombian are also on the list of cuisines to try as he settles in to this multicultural area.  In addition to that, I had the pleasure of catching up with a friend that went away to the Army a little less than 2 years ago.  He came home injured... from playing soccer in California.  I know; it isn't heroic, but hey - it got him out of the service and back home safe & sound.   Had lunch in a riverfront cafe that I've been dying to check out, and it was really very nice.  So, in all, aside from the sunburn, I had a faaaabulous weekend.  Hope you did too.  Diva out.

       Big Plans for the Summer   I have got my summer plans all wrapped up already.  Man, am I on top of things.  Yes, I am just that good. ';)  My daughter's First Communion is all but done for the 1st weekend in May - thanks mostly to my mother in law who is in complete control of that one.  Then there's the littlest diva's birthday / pool party the 2nd weekend in May.  For June, I've already booked at the  urlLink Celebration Hotel  for a visit to the Magic Kingdom and Epcot (Hey Fred, when's Gay Days?!?) with my girls and my mother in law.    For July, I've put together my very own Yoga Retreat.  I'm staying at  urlLink Boston Harbor Hotel  and plan on attending yoga classes at  urlLink Baron Baptiste's yoga studio in Boston .    Can't wait, can't wait, can't wait!  I am so ready for the summer.  Diva out.

       Soooo South Beach   Check out  urlLink Life is a Drag .  And since you brought up the subject, there's a new movie coming out about two women who pretend to be men who pretend to be women... you know, drag queens.  All I can say is, I can't WAIT to see that movie on South Beach.  Honey, there's going to more lipstick, heels and high-hair wigs in that theater than a close-out sale at Frederick's of Hollywood.  Life is better than fiction.  Diva out.

       Good Friday  Its Good Friday today, and they're serving fish in the employee cafeteria.  What a surprise.  And my hairdryer died this morning.  It slowed down, made this deep, whirring growl, then just faded away.  I threw it out.  But now I'm wondering if I should have kept it for another day or two... I mean, you know, maybe it could have started working again on Sunday.  Diva out.

       My gift recieved  Sometimes even the simplest moment shared can be such a great gift.  I had the immense pleasure of having lunch today with one of our city's most prominent figures.  He's compassionate and passionate about where he lives and what he does.  Just about everyone loves him, because he's just that kind of a man.  I was filling in the time while his lunch appointment rushed to get to the hotel to meet with him.  In that 20 minutes or so, we talked about life in Miami Beach, careers, love and lovers, friends and the joy of being who we are.  I can't impart to you what it meant for me to sit quietly at a table. While I munching multi-grain bread slathered with sweet butter, the sun was shining in through the windows, people were moving through the lobby and past the pool, diners were chatting and chewing nearby.  The few minutes we spent talking were more time than I've ever really had to get to know this amazing person.  He loves living his life, he loves his job - Tourism Director for Miami Beach (and so much more), his views on dating, on working a room, on living.  And when you talk, he really listens.  He wants to know all about you in a very sincere way that you feel.    And, now, more than ever, I want to be just like him when I grow up.    Diva out.

       Any excuse for a party  I was up late last night, making Egyptian Lentils for Maundy Thursday.  I'd never even heard of Maundy Thursday until last Sunday.  According to the female pastor at the Methodist Church where I study Buddhist meditation, Maundy Thursday is another name for Holy Thursday, the day Jesus instituted the Eucharist.  This is where we all sort of recreate the Last Supper by sharing a meal together.    Each year, this church gets together, preparing Middle Eastern meals like what would have been eaten way back then in the Middle East where Jesus lived and died.  We'll share our food and share stories of what god has done in our lives, or what he means to us; sing, dance, read poetry - whatever.  You know, "Eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow I die."  I'm looking forward to it.  My Egyptian Lentils came out really good, and I've brewed up some Mint Tea for the occasion.   Yummy!  And, another cause for celebration - today is  urlLink Buddha's  birthday.  Happy Birthday Buddha!  Diva out.

       LOL  There are times when I just don't laugh enough.  You know, days go by and a chuckle or giggle may escape me, but not those really hearty, robust laughs that shake your ribcage and make your face hurt.  I love those kinds of laughs.  Lately, I notice I've just been laughing more.  Laughing till tears are welling up in my eyes, laughing till I'm hoarse.    The other night, I was carrying my littlest diva with her head resting on my shoulder, her nose just brushing my neck.  I giggled; she breathed out her nose onto the softness of my neck.  I giggled louder.  Before we knew it, we were both giggling hysterically - me from being tickled and her from doing the tickling.  That was the release of a floodgate of laughter for me.  Now, I'm laughing quite a lot; at small misunderstandings and funny little anecdotes.  Life is funny, after all.  I'm feeling good, and my joy is flowing out in my laughter.  And, funniest thing of all is, the more I laugh, the better I feel.  Laughter must be so good for the soul.  Diva out.

       What say you?  So with the new look came a new comment feature.  I switched from Haloscan to the Blogger comments.  But, I don't get comments now.  All except that one question regarding bubble boy.  So, I was going to test the comment thing, you know - "Is this thing on?"  Turns out it was configured wrong and if you did want to comment on a post, you would have to sign in or something.    Well, I'm going to assume that THAT's the reason I've had no comments lately.  It couldn't possibly be that I've left you all speechless with my brilliance and charm.  *heh heh*  So, anyway, I've fixed the comments, so  when  you  want  to comment on a post,  now you can .  You're welcome.  Diva out.

       Always Learning  My teacher/pastor mentioned last night how she has learned to see the good in everything that happens.  Even the "bad" things have some kind of "good" in them.  A blessing or a lesson.  I felt pretty good when she said it, because I already knew that.  Yesterday was a tough lesson for me.  I received a call about my mom, and that she's being treated for her mental illness again.  This happened off and on while I was growing up. Anyone who's had the same experience knows what I'm talking about.  I was either on my own or in charge of my younger siblings while mommy was not around.    I haven't really had to go back to that since being an "adult", but yesterday, I was thrown back to being 5 years old and all alone.  But, instead of "burying myself in my work" as my boss does, I decided to investigate my feelings on a deeper level.  Figure out what I was feeling, where I was feeling it, and why.    And I kept reminding myself that no matter how "bad" a day I felt I may be having, ultimately it was my mother who was truly suffering.    So, I realized that there was some good in that experience and I looked for the lesson in it.  Then I said a little prayer for her, and for me, and today I hope we're both doing a little better.

       More Happy Happy Joy Joy  OR  Miscellaneous Happy News   First of all,  urlLink An Iraqi finds his own form of Democracy . Yay Salam Pax!  And to think, I read him when... his link has been on my blog since before the whole mess started, and its going to make a damn good movie, I think.  Next, seems like my good vibes are rubbing off on my oldest little diva.  I've been hauling her back and forth between school and afterschool, so she could stay late for jump rope practice.  That's right, jump rope.  She's a "jumper", and she's got the quads and calves to prove it.  She's been going to practice with her team at least twice a week, and I've been schlepping over from my office to her school, to the youth center and back to my office after every practice.  Last night, her team competed against several other local elementary schools. It wasn't like what I've seen on ESPN, but it was very cool.  I never realized you could do so much with a jumprope.  Well, anyway, my daughter's team won FIRST PLACE in her category.  Woo-hoo!  I'm so proud.  And, finally, I bought my ticket to Boston today.  So, that's it.  I'm all set... all I have to do is wait for July to get here.    It's good being me right now.    Diva out.

       Everything new!  First of all, this is my first entry with the new Blogger look.  Love it!  Second new thing is  urlLink my new car .  After the driver side window wouldn't go up on Thursday, I decided it really was finally time to get a new car.  I've been putting it off and putting it off, and the window was the last straw.  I'd been doing my "don't rain" dance for three days, since the window wouldn't go up.  On Sunday, I walked into a dealership that had contacted me on an internet query.  I was going to get something else, but I got such a good deal on this car instead, so I took it.   I think Fred will like it ~ in fact I know he would.  When you turn the headlights at night, the floorboards light up inside the car a lovely neon blue.  And the cupholders change colors from red to green, yellow to blue.  I have a disco in my car at night.  My little divas love it!  Diva out.

       Open for Business  I've been practicing Asthanga yoga for more than 5 years now.  Granted, I've been a little lazy lately, and haven't really practiced at home regularly for a few months.  The last time I went to a class I injured myself deep down in my shoulder.   I couldn't move my arm in the morning when getting out of bed, and it ached for weeks.  Then, about 2 weeks ago, just as the shoulder stopped aching, I woke up with a stiff neck and it's still bothering me a little.  All excuses and delays aside, I went to an Open Yoga class last night.  I tried talking myself out of it, noting other "more important" chores I could do instead.  I even arrived 10 minutes late to the asthanga class I had intended to take, but eventually ended up at the Open Yoga class instead.  Persistence prevailed!  It wasn't the usual asthanga, but I still was sweating while standing still.  I was introduced to a few poses that I have never tried, and found that challenging and fun.  It kind of shook me up a little.    I was reminded of why I love yoga.    This morning I'm a little sore, I'm sure its only a precursor to what tomorrow will be like.  But, still its not as deep an ache as asthanga gives me, or as deep as that injured shoulder asthanga gave me.  I'll still practice asthanga, but I'll probably mix it up a little more often.  Fred won't get this, but it just felt so good to sweat again.  Diva out.

       Gentle Reminder  Last night, while driving home after a yummy dinner at Sweet Tomatoes, I had what I thought was the misfortune of being caught up in traffic behind a v-e-r-y slow driver.  We're talking like 45 MPH when the limit is 55, and everyone does 65.  I was frustrated because I was trapped behind him for a minute or two, but was soon able to move into a faster lane.  Grrrrr....  But then, a few minutes later, the two left (fast) lanes slowed down to move around an accident.  An accident that had obviously occurred within the last 5 or 10 minutes.  There were 3 cars all crankled up together, and one man was lying flat on his back on the roadside, with a few people trying to help him.  Police and ambulance hadn't even made it there yet.  Suddenly, I kind of felt a little ashamed of my recent frenzy and frustration.  It may well be that, thanks to that v-e-r-y slow driver, I avoided being a part of this accident.  I just keep getting reminded that I don't always know the Plan, or what some other person has in mind.  I only know what I know, and I keep being reminded that I don't really know very much.

       The Diva Way           View all problems as challenges. Look upon negativities that arise as opportunities to learn and to grow. Don't run from them, condemn yourself, or bury your burden in saintly silence. You have a problem? Great. More grist for the mill. Rejoice, dive in, and investigate.  -Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, "Mindfulness in Plain English"   I didn't need beliefnet to send me this one, I already had this figured out.

       depressed?  my  urlLink boyfriend  *still not really used to that term* said i seemed depressed on friday night.  i didn't really think so at the time, maybe just a little tired.  but, then i realized that we are in summer now.  and i ALWAYS get depressed in the summer.  don't know why, i just do.  and of course my little diva-ettes are going away on sunday to visit their dad in atlanta for 15 days.  just the fact that they will be away from me for so long is enough to make me cry, nevermind it being summer too.  so, i'm fatigued for about a week now and i can't shake it.  got a kink in my neck since waking up friday morning which is adding to my fatigue.  little bit of a sore throat, so i'm also fighting a cold, and apparently losing that battle.  ok, a little depressed maybe.  but i'm taking the next 3 days off for a little r&r with my girls before they go away.  that may help.  diva out.

       Mindful Meanderings   People move in and out of our lives constantly (especially when you work in a hotel!).  Most people move in and out of your line of vision without ever leaving a mark.  It is those rare, soul-shaking moments when you meet someone new, but somehow familiar, that truly leave marks on the soul.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does, it really makes you wonder (much like this entire blathering must be doing now).  I met someone like that the other day, new but not new, and I always relish moments like that.    Then, did you ever notice how poetry can make just about  anything  sound appealing?  Romantic and dreamy?  I'm going to a spoken word event tonight to hear a singer that I really like.  It always amazes me how poetry works on your brain, making everything from waterdrops to blood sound oh, so wonderful.   I'm tempted to write something poetic about some really horrible thing, like decomposing flesh or garbage or something, but I'll spare you.  Of course, if you'd like to submit something in comments... you'll only serve to prove my point.  Also, I had a subtle reminder of what it means to let god work through you.  I never really considered what it means, but I had a great lesson yesterday morning.  My littlest diva-ette grabbed a bagel to go for breakfast, but then never ate it.  So, I removed it from the car, still intact and figured I would have it for breakfast myself.  On the way from car to hotel, I came across one of the resident homeless men that linger on the sidewalk on our hotel block.  Sometimes he's there, sometimes not.  I asked if he would like it, and he asked me, "You don't want it?".  Kind of a funny reply, I think.  But I assured him that it was his, handed it to him and had some granola I keep stashed in my desk drawer.  My littlest diva was the tool that allowed the universe to get that man his breakfast.  You just never know what comes your way.  And just when will school go year-round?  I have to sign up my oldest diva-ette for summer camp at $750 for 10 weeks.  Not bad, until I find that I don't get a sibling discount, since I'm not a resident where the camp is, and the littlest diva will also cost $750.  $1500 for 10 weeks of fun in the sun.  I'm thinking a labor camp in Siberia may be better, put 'em to work and pay me! *sigh*    Wonder if Martha Stewart has any openings.  Diva out.

       North to Alaska...   Well Everyone,   I am off to Alaska on the 16th to compete in the marathon. I still need about $1000.00 more for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society to meet my commitment, so if you can donate, or think of someone that may donate, I would appreciate it.   You can still go to  urlLink my site  and donate online. I am sorry but I havent updated it since the big Wine and Cheese party, and it was such a success too. Maybe I'll update it tonight. It's been kinda crazy, training for a marathon, getting my kid to all of his martial arts classes and swim team, workin', being a single Mom, fundraising, and... My God... what am I insane?   Anyway, if you wish to purchase raffle tickets for the grill, I have attached a flyer with the info. Please remember, if you donate towards the grill, be sure to email me your info, so that I can include you in the drawing on Saturday.   Please look for my further fundraising events and please feel free to share any ideas, that you may have to assist in my fundraising efforts.   Thank you again, EVERYONE, for your support.   With warmth in my heart and hope for the future,   Elizabeth Whitener

       Post Memorial Day Post  Well, this year's memorial day was kind of a bust, in that i got no bbq at all this year.  not a rib, not a wing, not a weenie.  *sigh*  But, on the good side, I did get to see the movie "The Day After Tomorrow", and of course going to see a big summer blockbuster open on Memorial Day is part of the whole tradition, right?  Yeah, honor our warriors by grilling steaks and watching people blow things up on the big screen.    So, it was pretty good and it struck a few chords in me, considering how much i am thinking about impermanence and emptiness these days.  *meditation is really sinking in*  Of course, there were a few quirks, like the phoney monster-like very digitally enhanced wolves scene, and just what happened to the people on that ship anyway?  nothing was topsy turvy in the kitchen, so they didn't fall out, the ship didn't go under and back up, nobody froze (that you could see)... ah, minor details that you are NOT supposed to think about.  Just watch the movie and eat your popcorn, and shut up already.  Liked it, would see it again.  Hope all of dear readers (all 2 or, dare I say 3, of you!)had a faaaabulous Memorial Day Weekend too.  Diva out.   **in afterthought, diva whispers carefully to herself... i'm sure that part about not getting any weenies this weekend will get Fred going on for a bit***

       Penny for your thoughts    I had the distinct pleasure of taking part in a research panel last night on my new Scion xA.&nbsp; Not only did they ask my opinions of my cute little car, but they paid me for my time.&nbsp;   I may have learned more from that meeting than the crew did.&nbsp; The chief engineer and designer from Japan was there, along with several other people from both Japan and California.&nbsp; There were only 2 other xA owners on the panel with me.&nbsp; But they were seriously into cars.&nbsp; One guy immediately removed the Pioneer stereo for something "better", changed the wheels and tires, added coil-overs (whatever the hell they are) and lowered the car.&nbsp; The other guy (of course these were both guys!) added a feature where he flicks his high beams to open the security gate in his building!   This last one really impressed the car design team.   And, apparently, there's quite a sub-culture surrounding the  urlLink Scions .&nbsp; xB'ers look with disdain on the xA'ers, we're like the red-headed step children of the Scion world.&nbsp; xA'ers commune with one another, and are likely to beep and wave at each other while passing on the highways.&nbsp; And who knows what the newly release tC coupe will bring to the picture.   There's even on online forum "Scion Life" where Scion owners unite and chat.   In the meantime, I'm just a boring little single mom diva driving around in what apparently is some sort of cultural phenomenon.&nbsp; Who knew?   All I know, is I got paid :)   Diva out.

       There's no place like home -- OR&nbsp; -- Home is where the Heart is  Hello dear reader, and welcome to another episode of my diva-ness.&nbsp; I set out for Bahstn (that's Boston for most of us) last Thursday, where I spent 5 days exploring the city.&nbsp; I had intened to immerse myself in yoga, but... well... that didn't happen. &nbsp; I did go to a class, but the teacher I wanted to see didn't actually teach there.&nbsp; So, in the end, I flew to Boston for a class I can take here in Miami.&nbsp; Whatever. &nbsp; I still managed to walk every inch of that town, from North End (Little Italy) to South End, Chinatown and Cambridge (Harvard).&nbsp; I saw Paul Revere's house, Benjamin Franklin's house, some famous poet's house (I forgot all of his 3 names right now - Longfellow?), and even Ye Olde Oyster House, established waaay back in the 1600's.&nbsp; You Boston readers will probably know I've gotten most of this wrong, but I was never very good in history anyway. &nbsp; I loved the blend of old, 17th century buildings mixed with modern, glass skyscrapers.&nbsp; And Beacon Hill - yeah, I could live there&nbsp;(in the summer).&nbsp; I walked up all 294 (?) steps of the Bunker Hill Monument.&nbsp; My heart was working so hard that a closed-up cut on my finger started to bleed again!&nbsp; And you'd think they could at least open the windows up there, for cryin' out loud.&nbsp;  &nbsp; I stayed in a historical hotel, so historical that I was afraid to open my eyes all of my first night there.&nbsp; I was afraid I'd open them and see dead people.&nbsp; I visited 4 or 5 cemeteries while there, all dating back to the 1600's.&nbsp; I love old cemeteries, and these were the oldest I've ever visited.  &nbsp; Old churches, old streets, old houses - all preserved and blended in with modern buildings.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Although, I did miss my little divas and my new boyfriend.&nbsp; I was sooo ready to come home by Sunday, but was there till Monday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't think I'll be travelling alone again anytime soon.&nbsp; It was great, but it may have been better with someone to share it with. &nbsp; I took more than 200 pics, and once I get them all together on my website, I'll share some with you.&nbsp; Of course, they don't actually have me in them, since there was no body around to take my picture.&nbsp; But I did manage to take a few special ones for Fred. &nbsp; That's all for now, diva readers.&nbsp; Gotta get back to my buried desk and get something done. &nbsp; Diva out. &nbsp; &nbsp;

      Parlez vouz?  I have discovered the coolest  urlLink translation website .  I often need to write letters in French and Spanish, and have to farm the work out to someone in the hotel who speaks and writes the language.  Now, I can translate things myself!  Not only will it translate a word or two, but it will translate a whole block of text, or even a website.  Check it out!  Ora, posso tradurre le cose io stesso! Tradurr non soltanto una parola o due, ma tradurr un blocco di testo intero, o persino un Web site. Controllilo fuori!  Nu, kan ik dingen zelf vertalen! Niet alleen zal het een woord of twee vertalen, maar het zal een geheel blok van tekst, of zelfs een website vertalen. Controleer het!  Diva hacia fuera.

       We Need Rain!   Not only does the current drought cause  urlLink troublesome brushfires , but I remember reading somewhere that dry rainy seasons create perfect conditions for strong hurricanes.  The basis of that thought was established with Hurricane Andrew, and research on previous rain measures prior to hurricanes in the past.  The fires are probably 20 miles west of here, but smoke filled the air downtown this morning, and you can smell it all the way over here on Miami Beach.  Its as bad as the media makes it out to be.  I am  so close  to going outside and doing a little rain dance.  Either that, or I may just break down and  wash my car.  ';)  Diva out.

       Living Vicariously   An email I received from a friend who just returned from attempting to climb to the top of the Grand Tetons in Jackson, Wyoming...   "I just want to say to you that it was  a pleasure and an honor to share this experience with you all.  I am  one lucky bitch.  love, amy  Hi all, Here is the link to the Mac site with photos from Gloria and my attempt  to summit the Grand Teton.   urlLink PhotoAlbum10.html   Angela was our guide and Karen came along to audit.  We hit some rough  weather as we approached the saddle the first day at about 11,400 feet;  first it rained, then grapple, otherwise known as hail, and then snow  with lighting and thunder.  It snowed and blew hard through the evening  accumulating about 4 inches, when we got up at 3 am.   We struggled to  about 1000' from the summit, but both Angela and Karen agreed that it  was taking too long and it was too icy to continue.   (Besides the fact  that both G and I were damn cold.)  It was a wonderful adventure and I learned a lot.  We were the only  group up there that evening and the mountain was beautiful.  When the  sun finally did come out it was truly a glorious sight.  None of the  other groups that followed us up made the summit either, so that  confirmed our decision.  The camaraderie made the experience and the serenity and majesty of the mountain will draw me back.  xoxo,  Amy"   I have to admit I have absolutely no desire to climb a mountain, but its kind of nice to dream... and to read first-hand from someone who has.

       Referred to in the Referrer  I've been meaning to comment on this before, and today I think I can put it off no longer.  I always get a kick out of the Referrer spot on my blog, the place that tracks web referrences to this page; in a most unscientific and sporadic way.  I once read a blog page that added symbols to misspell a popular current topic, just to avoid being referred to in search engines.  Now I see why.  I get some of the weirdest mentions on that little referrer!  And, sadly, sometimes that referrer is more entertaining than my blog.  What sparked my comments today was the "miami beach shitty fireworks" search.  First of all, why would anyone search in that specific way?  What exactly were they looking for?  Second, I didn't mention fireworks on the beach in my blog... did I?   Maybe I did.  Anyway, I think its funny because, obviously, I am not the only one with that opinion of this year's fireworks.  And, perhaps, the searcher was there too.  Sitting on Miami Beach, with me and 49,998 other spectators, waiting and waiting... for a show that started too late and ended too soon.  We are all connected, and sometimes we get to see little hints of this truth.  Diva out.

       Don't You Hate It When...   When it doesn't rain like its supposed to in the summer?  Days are too hot, a/c units break down, and palmetto bugs *ick* come out of everywhere looking for water.  When you're wearing your big granny underwear (for  those  days) and you realize (a little too late) that when you reach down for a file, the granny undie waistline reaches far above your pants waist - BUSTED!  When the one gift you've been waiting for for MONTHS finally gets delivered, but its broken.  When you do nice things for people and they take advantage of it and complain when little things don't go just right.  When your boss takes off in the middle of the day to go to the gym, and you're stuck in the office holding down the fort.  When a good friend is hurting but you don't really know how to make her feel any better about all that she's losing.  When your day makes you just want to shrivel up in a hole somewhere and never be nice to anyone or get close to anyone ever again.  Just one of those kinds of days...  Diva out.

       Woo-hoo!  Yesterday, someone asked me about my blog and whether or not I knew how many people visited it.  I said, with great pride, that, "Yes, and I've had almost 5000 hits in a little more than two years".    urlLink Wow, it's been more than 2 years.   But I see that I was incorrect, because my little counter in the corner says 5004.  Woo-hoo! Thank you, thank you dear readers.  You like me, you really like me. (couldn't resist).  So, Happy Belated Bloggiversary to Me, and Happy Monday to you, dear reader, whichever number you are.  Diva out.

       The Sky is falling!  For those of you who know what I mean, Mercury is going retrograde on Monday. And, from all accounts, its going to be a bitch.  Mercury hasn't even started yet, and my daughter just lost my brand new, very cool cell phone that I got in June. wahhhhh!!  Fortunately, I have already called my service provider and they have turned off that very cool phone and switched my service back to my very boring cell phone stashed away at home.  For more on Mercury Retrograde, go  urlLink here.   diva out.

       Wonderful World  It is absolutely, positively impossible to be in a bad mood while listening to Loius Armstrong's "What a Wonderful World" CD.   I may have to make that my holiday gift to everyone I know this year.  I'm listening to "The Home Fire" and I have this warm little joy in my belly.   It  is  a wonderful world, Mr. Armstrong.  Yes, indeed.  Diva out.

       Gotta have friends  I guess I would be remiss if I didn't mention the great time I had with two of my friends over the weekend.  Friends from high school, Gardenpixie, Wyldchyld and myself all met for sushi with our significant others.  We are, and have always been, quite a potpourri of girls.  My boyfriend even asked me how it could be that we were ever friends ~ we are very different from each other in general.  Gardenpixie and her hubby were celebrating their 17th wedding anniversary, they married very young and the marriage just keeps holding.  Wyldchyld brought along her new boyfriend, as she and her got-married-really-young husband have split.  Then there's me with my online boyfriend after a very shortlived marriage.  We have different tastes in music, food and fun.   We may not have much in common, but somehow there is a common thread that binds us.  Years and miles have been unable to undo the ties.  And, when I'm with my friends, I feel 16 again.  And, just as we did years ago, I never laughed so hard as when I'm with my friends.  I'm fortunate to have a great collection of eclectic friends from all walks of life.   It probably confuses the hell out of my boyfriend, trying to figure out  why  I call these people friends, but honestly, there is no rhyme or reason to my friendship.  It's pretty much out there for anyone who'll claim it.  Diva out.

Anyway, the entries are  urlLink here.  My entry is  urlLink here.   The balance of my  urlLink Boston pics  are up too.  Enjoy!  Diva out.
