      Why do people turn to alcohol to try and sort out their problems??  Fucking hell I'm beginning to sound like some old tosser, maybe its just because I work in a pub and see the negative side of it more than I do the positive (of which there are many, beer for example has been helping ugly people get laid since 1845)  My mate and his girlfriend have split up, now this has been on the cards for a while and I think the only thing keeping them together was the fact that they own a house together, but they have finally gone their separate ways and parted company, except that they haven't. They have decided to keep the house for the sake of their investment and for my mates dad who would be otherwise made homeless. So they are going to sleep in separate rooms, except that there not because me and the girlfriend haven't moved out yet, so there they are two single people spending every night in the same bed, and just for good measure Sunday morning after they had both been out on the piss the night before they hopped on the good foot and did the bad thing at her request I might add. Which you may think is alright after all they are two single people with no commitments or attachments but surely that is not the way to split up with someone.  Anyway my original point was about people drinking so now I will get to it, it has been over a week now since they split up and I don't think the girlfriend (well ex-girlfriend anyway) has spent a night out of the pub since and not even that she has started smoking loads more dope than she normally does. Maybe it's just me but what's the fucking point its not actually going to do anything or make things better is it for fucks sake and its not even as though she is going to the pub to see her mates and has a few drinks cos and I'm not having a go here but she hasn't really got any mates except my girlfriend and a few others none of who are going down the pub with her.  Why are people insistent that alcohol makes things better it fucking doesn't all it does is makes you think about something else for a few hours then you wake up in the morning feeling like shit and the problem is still there, and half the fucking time if your trying to drink to forget something then chances are something will remind you of what you are trying to forget and then you will be a fuckload worse cos your all pissed and emotional so the thing that is supposed to be helping you feel better in fact ends up making things worse. Why the fuck can't people just deal with things and move on and to quote the streets 'Dry your eyes mate - there plenty more fish in the sea' ex-fucking-actly have a good cry or mope about for a bit whatever then get on with it. alcohol to me is a way to enjoy yourself and make a good night better its not a fucking magic drug that makes you forget everything fuck if that's what you want then go get some fucking rohypnol.  Anyway back to my mate. He on the other hand has taken it quite well and I think this is because he didn't really want to be with her anyway by texting, phoning all the single girls in his phone book and going out clubbing and attempting to shag anything that moves (and a few things that don't). I think the reason he has slipped back into this single male slag lifestyle so well after four years of being in a relationship is because he hasn't really stopped. He was still going out at the weekend and trying to shag anything that moves and texting, phoning all the girls in his phonebook, the only difference now is that he doesn't have to hide his actions from a possessive overbearing girlfriend.  She however is now tentatively taking the first steps toward a new relationship with the local friendly drug dealer. Who better for a pothead to go out with than the gut that keeps her in weed? Now I don't really know the guy but I have met him in the pub a few times and to me he seems like a bit of a bellend, hey they should get along just fine.  Returning to an earlier point my mate is very obviously on to a bit of a good thing here because he goes out tries to shag and succeeds or not as the case may be, so goes home at the end of the night and climbs into bed with his ex who then tries it on with him! You show me a single man in this country that would turn down that opportunity and I my friend will show you a liar! But how do you think the new man in her life feels o.k so they aren't together and haven't slept with each other but still there is something there and they have been on a few dates and it is probably only a matter of time, so he takes her out for dinner they have a good night he walks her home gives her a kiss goodnight and the next thing he knows is she has hopped into bed with her ex-boyfriend and if anything happens or not is beyond the point it can't be a very nice feeling knowing the woman that you want to be with is sleeping next to another man.  Enough moaning for now. Later

      So we picked up the keys to the flat on Friday (me and the girlfriend) and went round to see it for the first time (she had already seen it and said that she wanted it and I trust her so agreed to it without actually seeing it). I'm glad in a way that I didn't go to see it before hand because my initial reaction was it's a heap of shit but once you look past the yellow stained ceilings and green and pink wallpaper peeling off the walls its actually not bad. In fact the first thing we did was to strip all the shit wallpaper and paint the ceilings and its starting to look better already.  Don't know how long it will be before we actually get to move in there but the way things are going could be in next week hopefully, once we get the walls painted and the carpet down we should be ready to go although it might be a bit bare to start with we will get there.  The only down side to all this is the dictatorship of decoration I am now living under. I am not the best person in the world at D.I.Y in fact I enjoy UDIY (UnDo It Yourself) much more that is to say I enjoy destroy things much more than I do creating. So now that all the wallpaper has been pulled off (very therapeutic ripping things of the wall) I have lost motivation for actually painting the walls although there is still the job of sanding down all the doors which although the bigger picture is creative looking at the job in hand it is quite destructive.  Call me a freak or weird if you like but there is something quite rewarding in destroying something someone else has worked so hard to create, I think it's some kind of perverse power trip. Knowing that you can destroy something that has taken hours to build in just a few minutes, it just seems to give me a power trip that makes everything seem better. I think my fucked up mind must release a few more endorphins every time I break something.  I think that is probably why I enjoy work at the moment as it is my sole responsibility to break things ( I am testing software) and when I do break it it's almost like a big fuck you to the developers 'you might be getting paid shit loads of money but I can still break your code'  It's not just a physical or software thing either it works with people as well rather than just telling someone to fuck off or punch them in the face next time they annoy or slag you off you if you can mentally break them then it is much more rewarding.  Back to the flat - we seem to be flying through everything on Friday the place was a state but in just three short days we have stripped all the wallpaper, cleaned and filled and sanded all the walls, and put undercoats in three of the rooms. I reckon we could well have it all decorated in a week.  Well I think that's enough of me going on about shit that no one really gives a fuck about so until something interesting happens,  Later

      Well there you have it all the pre-season hope and optimism have been shot down already after a 90 lesson in how to play football by the seemingly unstoppable Arsenal. Well I suppose it was inevitable really, think the best thing to do is forget about this one and start a fresh again next week against the palace. I just hope we have managed to climb a few places (well three to be precise) come the end of the season. Good news today though about the injection of £20 million although I fear it could all be a little bit too late would have been better to get new players in early so they could get used to the rest of the squad.  Haven't got much else to say on the subject so that's enough football for now.

      In response to the comments made on my last post.  Firstly would like to start of by saying that I'm not trying to get into some sort of online slanging match with someone I've never met so Mr K if you read this post remember that without hearing or understanding the context and tone of the following words you may possibly take them the wrong way but let me assure you all I am going to do is address your comments and if they piss you off then I am sorry but that is not my intention.  Firstly yeah I remember buying the jaffa cakes I may be wrong here but the way I read that is though you seem a bit pissed at me for doing so and once again if I'm wrong then I apologize, The reason I bought the jaffa cakes is two fold really firstly Emma a good friend of mine said that she wanted some jaffa cakes and as I was going to the shop anyway thought I would get some. Secondly and the reason I didn't take any money for the jaffa cakes is I am always popping round and pinching Nat's and Emma's sweets and biscuits or whatever so thought the jaffa cakes would be a way of saying thankyou.  Now on to the fact that you don't think 'I love or even like my girlfriend'. What gives you that impression? a few posts all made on the same day with a few comments about how she pisses me off? Well if that's then the case then no I can't stand her, but the reality of the situation is I was having a bad day that particular day for one reason or another and decided that a good way to vent my anger/frustrations would be to write it down on this here blog. I had just had a few shit days at home and just wanted to be elsewhere and by writing those things down it seemed to help the situation. So in answer to your question No we are not staying together just for the kids sake and we are very much in love.  It just so happened that you caught us at a bad time. Are you honestly telling me that you have never been in love with someone but at the same time been pissed off with them? After all they do say that you take things out on the people that you love.

      What possesses someone to drink until they pass out?  Now don't get me wrong I am all for having a few vodka and red bulls and a bit of a laugh or dance whatever but I like to think I know where the limit is and yes occasionally I have a few too many and pray to the porcelain goddess but thankfully with age comes the realisation of where that line between seeing dinner again or not is.  Which brings me to my point last night I was in the pub working (as I do twice a week) and there were the usual piss head suspects in there drinking a shit load as per usual, and when I say a shit load as usual I mean these guys will spend a couple of hundred quid a week each on booze but last night about nine o'clock most of them decide to go home but the biggest tosser amongst them decides that he's going to stay and have a few more and a bite to eat, anywho about ten o'clock I come round the corner and there he is sat next to the table asleep in his chair. The guy is a fucking waste of space he is asleep in the pub, surely there is something in his head that is saying to him feeling a bit tired maybe I should get home after all I do have work in the morning, why on earth would you even think about falling asleep in the pub, I really cannot comprehend how some peoples brains function (although I should imagine that his judgments are clouded by the fact he is never sober).  What is wrong with people these days ( I sound like an old tosser but bear with me) why would anyone allow themselves to get in that state surely you can see the warning signs coming like when you wake up in the pub with the barman telling you that there is a taxi outside waiting for you would a normal person not think fuck me I probably need to stop drinking as much but no he will probably be back in the pub tonight, fuck he's probably already had a six pack of Stella this morning in order just to function properly.  Now there may well be some major underlying reason as to why he drinks as much as he does but to be honest I don't give a fuck if he isn't fucking clever enough to realise he is a fucking alcoholic then fuck him the tosser. Relating it to my own situation as I mentioned in a previous post I've put on a bit of weight and am trying to do something about it likewise if I started drinking more then I would do something about it in fact I have, I have always had a rule of no drinking on a week night as what's the point in getting drunk when you can't sleep it off the next morning or even just lie on the sofa with shit on telly while the world carries on around you for a few hours. It kind of takes the shine of it if you have to get up and go to work in the morning feeling like shit. Point is that about a year ago just after I moved into the house I'm in know with my mate we started drinking on week nights but after getting up and feeling shit in the mornings I decided what's the point and now the vodka is well and truly locked up till Friday night.  I think the problem arises when the reason for going to the pub changes. I use the pub as an excuse to get out the house and go and see my mates talk shit and have a laugh (at each others expense normally) but when you start going to the pub straight after work for a few pints and are still in there when the bell rings you have a fucking problem.  The same theories could be applied to any sort of addiction (o.k hands up I smoke but that doesn't leave me as a fucking wreck at the end of the night or wake up in the morning not remembering how I got there). Why can people not see that this substance (alcohol or cocaine or whatever) is starting to take over your life. If you ask me if you do/take something more days/nights a week than you don't do/take said thing then my friend you have a problem and should stop. There are enough fucking counselors and re-hab clinics out there these days that anyone should be able to get help with anything.  I swear I would be the best fucking counselor in the world and if you think that advice was good you should hear me when it comes to relationship advice the amount of women I have heard moaning about there other halves and time after time my advice is what they end up doing if only they had listened to me in the first place they would be so much better off. I have lost track of the amount of times I have told a woman to dump her boyfriend cos he is treating her like shit but, 'he said he'll change' is the usual reply. No he fucking won't because the first time you let him get away with it you gave him a license to do it again. What happens a week or two later the same girl is having the same moan about the same thing, well I told you so now tell him to fuck off this usually goes on for a few months till finally they see what a twat he has been or he gets bored of it and dumps her (usually because he has found something better). If only they had listened to me in the first place.  In my experience I have found that this type of counseling usually works best if you would fuck the girl in question as you will naturally care more about something that you have an interest in and all I mean by that statement is that she is worth one you don't have to be secretly in love with her just willing to shag her because 9 times out of ten they'll feel some kind of bond toward you and after a few drinks will probably want to 'thank' you and you wouldn't want to shun her generosity now would you??

      After yesterdays bitching about the shit situation at home it seems that things are looking up (no the cats haven't all 'mysteriously' drowned) but looks like me and my girlfriend are moving into our very own two bedroom flat no more people whinging at me for not tidying up when that very same person doesn't even know where the Hoover is, no more fucking barking dogs going mad at fucking nothing, no more having to listen to people tell me what they are going to do rather than just doing it.  unfortunately there will be a price to pay whilst we will have our freedom and our own rules to live by there will be no Sky T.V (well not for the first week at least it won't be long before it arrives trust me), there will be no babysitter on hand if we decide to pop out, and it will mean that I have no one but the girlfriend to talk to, still all said and done the positives far out weigh the negatives and hopefully I will be able to get a PC at home and be able to surf the web at my freedom rather than when I'm supposed to be at work!!  Anyway rather short and sweet today bye.

      Third and final blog of the day,  Firstly and completely off topic of what I planned to write just thought I'd put down why I was writing this blog, I figured that by writing shit down I might be able to get some sort of direction and meaning to my shit life and also cos I've always toyed with the idea of writing a diary but could never be arsed and finally cos if there's anyone out there who can be bothered to read this they might have some sort of idea as to what I could do to try and sort myself out.  Home is where the heart is well in that case I suppose I should be living on a football pitch as that is one of the few pleasures in life that I actually enjoy. But I don't I live in a three bed terrace with every fucking man and his dog. First up there's my mate. I get on well with him but he's not happy with his girlfriend and that kinda makes things a bit awkward at times especially when I know most of the shit he has been up to behind her back and am expected to lie for him, this I don't have a problem with as if I scratch his back he will scratch mine.  Which I suppose brings us on to his girlfriend who is a prick nearly everything she does pisses me off. I could make a list but I haven't got that much time. The main things that piss me off is the way she thinks she owns my mate she will barely let him shit without going with him which pisses him off and makes him moody and then she wonders why he is in a mood with her for fucks sake. Other things that piss me off include the way she says things about what she is about to do that I couldn't care less about and we are not talking about big things I mean silly little things like "I'll just feed the cats and then go for a cigarette" Do you think I give a fuck why not just fucking do it rather than fucking tell me?????? And the fact that she can't cook now I haven't got a problem with people who can't cook as its not for everyone (although its not exactly difficult and would just like to say I am a pretty good cook) but if you can't fucking cook then don't for fucks sake. On a positive note I think she has realized this as she hasn't cooked for a while now. Well so much for not making a list!! I might as well just put one more thing down while I'm at it. She is such a fucking waster I cannot remember the last time she finished a glass of drink or a full meal. Now I'm not going to go on about the poor starving kids in the third world but for fucks sake if you don't want a whole glass of coke then only fucking poor yourself half.  Having said all that I would probably still fuck her!  After those two is my mates dad. Now on his own he is alright and I have no problem with him what so ever, I do however have a problem with his fucking dog. The bitch is a fucking pain in the arse she is always barking at shit, trying to eat lights and reflections shiny things, getting up on the sofa and lying under your feet. While I'm on the subject of animals I suppose I had better mention the cats, the best thing I could probably say about the cats is I am quite tempted to throw them all in the river and hold their heads down. Now normally I have absolutely no problem with animals and in fact wouldn't mind getting a dog of my own (never been a huge cat fan but my mum's is cool) it just seems that we have quite possibly the worst collection of animals possible if you wrote a list of all the things you didn't want in a pet then between the dog and three cats I bet I could cover your list.  Which brings me on lastly but not leastly to my girlfriend and my baby. We will start with my baby cos she is seven months old and perfect you could not ask for a better baby which makes me wonder how on earth she came out of my girlfriend who to be fair is alright most of the time which makes it difficult to understand why she is such a bellend the rest of the time. I know I probably bring most of it on myself but sometimes I think she is on a personal mission just to piss me off. I think most of the problem that I have posted three times today and haven't said a good word about anything is because I haven't had a shag for over a couple of weeks now which is another of my girlfriends down sides she just never seems up for it that and the fact she normally goes to bed about an hour before me means its very few and far between these days, and if this really is what married life is like then I'll stay a batchelor thankyou.  Apart from the sex side of things there is the fact that she is always nagging at me to do something she seems to think that when I get home she all of a sudden doesn't have to do anything and I have to do everything despite the fact that I have been at work all day this goes back to probably being my fault as when she asks what I've been up to say not much and she then sees this as her ticket for me to do everything when the reality of it is most days I am up to my bollocks in work but cannot be arsed to tell her what I've been doing cos when I do she gets all disinterested and bored with it all so I don't bother (the fact that I have done nothing today as my three posts go to show is neither here nor there thankyou).  I think the final thing that pisses me off about her is the mood swings eg I will tell her I am thinking of going out next week if she wants to come knowing full well that she wont (and trust me that's the best way I've tried telling her I'm going out and she gets stroppy and I've tried asking and she says no and gets stroppy but most of the time this approach seems to work) yet sometimes I ask and yeah its no problem off you go have a good night and other times its you don't spend anytime with me (uh hello apart from nearly every fucking night) or your baby.  One More: what is it with women I mean ask a bloke do you mind if I go out? And you will get a yes or no answer and he will mean what he says you don't have to fucking ask him if you want him to go in case he feels left out or try and read into what his yes actually means. Why can't a woman give a straight answer to a straight question, or just fucking do something rather than asking me if I would mind doing it and therefore implying that I should do it and if I don't then I'm the bad guy. If she just fucking did it in the first place then there wouldn't be a fucking problem?  Hopefully be back tomorrow.

      The problem in my life is that there is no real direction, I just seem to go from one day to the next it's always the same, I'm stuck in a rut and can't really see anyway of getting out of at the moment. The worst thing is I don't even now what is causing the rut, my girlfriend, my job, my housing situation (read 'and then there was me'), in fact the only thing I can be sure it's not is my daughter and I'm not even 100% sure that it isn't her. Not that I would change her for the world but given the choice I wouldn't have chosen to be 23 with a kid.  I think one of the reasons I'm in the rut is because I am lazy. This is the one thing I hate most about myself but also the thing I seem unable to do anything about, whilst this may seem like a bit of a shit excuse lets look at the evidence taking as a case study the fact I have put on a stone in the last two months, now if you know me you would now that of all the people I hate in this world and there are a lot of them but I'm sure in due course we will cover most of them. But up there at number one has to be fat people who don't seem bothered about the situation and don't try and change the fact that they are fat (incidentally second on the list is all other fat people)  So Case study: I am 6 foot and weigh just under 13 stone while this is the normal weight for height I'm not happy as this has manifested itself as a bit of a beer belly. So why don't I do something about it, well its not like I'm not trying but it always seems like theres something else to do, typical day consists of get up, get ready for work, go to work, come home, play with my daughter, feed her, have something to eat, watch some tv, go to bed.  The ideal time to do anything about losing weight ie getting off my arse and doing some exercise would be when I get home from work but then I wouldn't be able to play and talk to my baby and then I get my girlfriend on my case telling me I never spend enough time with my daughter. So that's after work out of the question. And by the time I've finished playing with her fed her and put her to bed its half past eight and time for dinner, which is another problem in itself.  The problem with dinner is its just too easy to eat shit, I've been at work as have my best mate and his girlfriend and his dad (see 'and then there was me') and my girlfriend has been looking after the baby all day so no one is in the mood to cook dinner for 5 people plus the fact we all have separate lives so no one really knows who is doing what. Which means it is far to easy to phone up and order pizza or Chinese or Indian etc etc. So that's dinner dealt with and by then we are talking half nine ten o'clock so its dark plus the fact I've just stuffed myself with food so now is not the time to do exercise. Which only leaves bed time and considering the fact I'm not a morning person at the best of times means that I need my sleep.  Having said all that I am trying to sort it out I have stopped eating as much during the day ( it wasn't uncommon for me to go to the shop at lunch time and buy five chocolate bars and a few packets of crisps and sit at my desk and eat them all in the afternoon after having a proper lunch) and I've started playing football again (although I didn't really stop it was just the end of the season). Next on the list is to not eat so much shit at home and then I will try and address the problem of doing some proper regular exercise  So there you have it and trust me that's only just the tip of the iceberg as to my rut. I will try and address some more of the issues mentioned above later.

      So I suppose I should start with a small introduction: I'm a 23 year old man (some would say boy) living in the south east of England. I live with my girlfriend, my baby, best mate his girlfriend and his dad. Crowded is not the word. Given a choice I think I would only choose to live with one or two of them but the two in question seem to differ on a day to day basis. Workwise I am a bit in between jobs at the moment that doesn't mean I'm unemployed far from it, I say that because I'm not entirely sure what I do or who I do it for.  Let me explain - I work for a fairly large company (in fact we are the market leaders in our field) in head office I was employed to work in a section called Pricing where we are responsible for pricing (pretty self explanatory) but at the start of the year my boss moved me off that team into a team of my own where I didn't have anything to do, and now I find myself in a completely different office working with the IT guys testing software and come October the project I am currently working on will be finished so you can see that I don't really know what is going on  Explanation over let me continue with the introduction, Outside of work and home I enjoy doing most of the things you would associate with a 23 year old slightly immature man that is to say drinking, going clubbing, football, watching t.v blah blah, of the things listed my main passion is football, I watch and play as much football as my girlfriend will possibly let me get away with. Anywho I think that's enough of a brief explanation for you (whoever you are and if in fact you are anyone) to get a background into me. Not that I've really said alot but then hey I guess there not much to say.
