      Okay, it is 8:40, and I am going over to hang out with my other friends (Jay, John, and Cort).  I needed some time to spend with them...  I've spent a lot of time with you folks, but I also need to respect them shizzles.  Have fun, and I really hope we do something tomorrow. PLEASE!  I NEED STIMULATION (and, yes, also in the way you distgusting people are thinking).

      hmm, yep, price does sound quite good. i'd say i'm for it....  i'm basking in my own happiness cause i found a site with a shite load of hist. notes.. evn though y'all in ap probably know about it already..haha... eh, that's alright... cause i'm still fly....  poor mg has to be sick... hmm, i'll send some good health vibes your way.. maybe i could even send my poltergeist pirate over to make yous ome soup? haha  ok, i can't believe i haven't had you guys listen to this song yet, but i'm totally hooked on it.. and in the beginning, it gives this peice of wisdom: "If you got 36 prostitutes, and 30 cents in your pocket, what you got?...heh....Proof that hoes come a dime a dozen baby..." then it busts into this funky surf retro thing about being gone all summer to be a pimp and coming back to see if your girlfriend still loves you...haha, good times...  Damn it  DOES  feel good to be a gangsta....

      AHHHHH...... CHOOOOOOO!!!  damn, it does not feel good to be a gangsta, especially a sick one. =/ grrrr... stupid nose!! but anyway, i think the price thing sounds decent, taking a walk down memory lane could turn out to be entertaining... or very bad, you never know.... besides, i suppose it is something different from what we usually do. maybe we can have some food afterwards too, and then a secret rendezvous..... did i say secret rendezvous? oops, i meant, uh yeah...  damn, you know what would make my nose feel better is some coffee..... =D  on a sidenote, biology outlines should go to hell... >.

      Just so you all know the "Damn it feels good to be a gangsta" song is sung by Ghetto Boys...  Just thought you folks should know, it might be on Jeorpardy or the History final, you never know. I would actually like to go back to Price tomorrow (if I am not doing stuff with Cortland, John, Jay, and Benton).  I would like to see old teachers and whatnot.  So, yeah, count me in!  and remember, YOU AIN'T SHIT WITH OUT THE OVERSOUL, YOU MODA FUCKAS!

      Hey guys, Damn it feels good to be a gangsta. I gots an idea for FRIDAY!!! How about we go to Price's bingo night?  Relive old times at the old alma mater!!! eh? It starts at 6, will be over by 8, so we can still do something afterwards.  AND...if you win, you get this themed gift basket thingy, every class made one.  Last year my mom's class made an ice cream one with gift certificates to baskin robbins.  THis year my little sister's class made a exotic food one (like she put in one of thoes bamboo shusi roller things).  FINALLY...its for a good cause!! How about it amigos?  I think its an excelent idea.  And FUCK THE PO-LICE!! billy - i knew that, just wanted to make fun of you jason - what's the thing about "i'm still really wet from the park"?  I didn't know you had  that  much fun! CARLIE ~ DAMN IT FEELS GOOD TO BE A GANGSTA (damn song is stuck in my head now, thanks Beth)

      What's this about "Jason can't drive otherwise?" do you mean i'll be gone Sat/Sun? I'm still pretty wet from the park...sorry about the car Jessie, i'll look where i throw next time. And what are NINE water bottles doing in the back of my car?! NINE? We went through that many water bottles? 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9! Tomorrow: anything works for me, as of now...could change though, but don't expect it to

      Okay, here is the Shizzat... 1.  The song "Damn it feels good to be a gangsta" is written/song by GHETTO BOYS. Despite the name of the band, it is a really good rap song.  (Val, just try it.  It feels good the first time you do it). 2.  I'd like to do soemthing on Friday since Jason can't drive otherwise.  Also, I want to do something Sat. with Cortland and John. 3.  Carlie, I don't want to have sex with Jason's dad.  "FUCK THE POLICE" is a line from an NWA song.  It is really good and it is really funny.  SO FUCK THE POLICE AND YOU, j/k... AND FINALLY, 4.  Enjoy the CD's I made, I really had fun picking the songs! And with that said, peace out my niggas (OH NO, IS THE MULLET BLACK LADY GONNA SUE ME NOW?  GOD DAMN YOU HUCK FINN, DAMN YOU TO HELL)

      ah, poor beth! haha... i'm doing quite well.. my stomache kinda hurts from rehrsal today.. too much laughing. or maybe i'm just hungry...? only time will tell...  man, selfridge really cracked me up today witht he queen song. he was so happy and smiling... and did anyone else catch that "that'll be your guy's theme of the day" comment or was that just me? haha  yeah, i'm down for tomorrow or anything. i get my car back! well, ok, it's been back, but my dad hasn't authorzed the driving of it because he's to frwaked out. one of the gas valves turned 4 rotations all by it self! with no physical assistance.. very weird... so last night i had this dream that my car had a gohst that would totally ruin things, but it made no sense because it was a pirate gohst. and i was like "why are you in my car?!?" and he's like "arrrg, cause i've always loved the ocean." haha, i don't know...

      bombs over baghdad bitch...  congratulations carlie! you guys were really kicking del mar's ass, and from what i saw, it was quite a lovely first half of a game. ideas for friday: ummmm..... none as of yet. although we will definitely pimp it somehow or another. how about doing some shizat tomorrow afternoon after school? should we jamba it? starbucks it? the third day of my strike ha been going well so far... anyway, yeah, tomorrow afternoon sounds nice.. maybe it would cure beth of her chronic boredom too. :) dibs in jason's car! (just because i'll be needing a ride home-ish anyway....)  oh yes, and today selfridge said "hello maggie" to me in an empty hall..... maybe ryan wouldn't get it, but eeeee!! it was creepy! and he still wonders why students are too scared to talk to him.... hahaha....

      Damn it feels good to be a gangsta.  Yes Carlie, I did watch Alias. I was quite perturbed because nothing can ever be solved on that damn show. Just when something good start to happen, something else goes to hell. It's quite frustrating. Anyway, I want to do something on friday night as well, but i believe i have been screwed over by damn pep band. Oh well, maybe i can meet up with you guys when the game is over.   Well, I hope everyone is having a dandy week.  p.s.- i think i'm suffering from chronic boredness

      Are guys sure you don't want to come to my soccer game on friday?  It's over in the g-hetto!  It's at Overflet, 3:15.  Major ass should be kicked, etc. Beth - Did you watch Alias on Sunday?  What's up with these damn cliffhangers?  And what's up with Sloan and Sark, incahoots!? And Sydney's friend, with the bullet in her brain and the twin!!! I just don't understand!!! Yeah, ah, soccer @Del Mar, 3:15, if you are interested again.  I will be waiting for you!

      since i'm leaving for Tahoe again on Saturday (not at 5 in the morning this time, so i can stay out late), i'd also like to do something on Friday (not that we weren't). But then, if someone wants to take me to Tahoe a day early, that'd be even better.        Jessie: i really shouldn't laugh, so i won't          Beth: i think your lovely suggestion needs a bit more loveliness around the trim...also, i'm mad about the hist notes too. I was considering downloading all of them a while back, but got lazy and didn't think they would ever go down         Mandy: what the heck?           Maggie: staying up until after midnight when coming off an addiction isn't the best thing to do           anyone else who is still reading: i imagine track practice starts next week, so if i was going to give you a ride (in which case you didn't tell me about it yet and i'm just doing this before you do), i can't until around 4-ish          Me: stop using parenthesis and -ish stuff

      I have a lovely suggestion for Friday. I think that everyone should come to the basketball team and support the band!!! Sounds lovely, doesn't it. Well, that's how i'm spending the majority of my friday night, and you guys can come if you're feeling particulary spirited- and then i won't feel incredibly outnumbered by the irritating branham-folk that attend the basketball games.  p.s.- i'm really pissed about the damn history notes

      Hey People, What's up with Billy and the fuck the po-lice mentioning?  Is it that Bily wants to fuck Jason's dad? (you know he was once a police man). Or is it just Billy's urge to be a black rapper with criminal inclinations?  Or, was he taken in for questioning and then butt rapped mutiple times by a sex-starved, over weigth, coffee drinking, doughnut eating, cops?  Anyways, I'm glad the skiing was  good , ahem. I was just thinking, if I ever get a chance to get my own car, and therefore my own license plate, I think I want it to be muhu.  If that is taken then my next choice would be muhux2 (cause that would be muhu, muhu) MU-HU!!! While talking about mu-hu related things, MU-HU!! maggie to the prichard related ranking issues.  You know you'll always be number one in my grade book (at least after last night!)

      okay, i have made a new semester's resolution.... day one of the new semester, and with this first week, i will drink no caffeine or eat it (if that is possible) at all! that's right. no coffee. no soda (except sprite). no tea. i am frickin' caffeine celibate. today was hard enough. if i make it to next monday, then i will be so completely  starved ... anyway, wish me luck, and keep those tempting frappachinos out of my face!  today i also got ridiculed (politely) by prichard, who told me it was a shame to have the top 3 grades in AP bio all belong to boys.... god dammit.... i was pulling rank at third for the whole semester, and then i go down by like .2 something points.... this wouldn't have irked me, but prichard just had to mention it... and this is right after she tells jason that ranking is not important!! and what does she do? she ranks me!! grrrr...  while on the topic of teachers, selfridge looks really odd in his baseball get-up.... um yeah..... i've just been so disturbed lately... well, off to pick at my crimson jelly-filled donut of a scrape... =D

      Alright, haven't been doing too much posting, but a new semester means a new beginning, right?  Well, anyway, here I go...  The party, was off the hizzle for shizzle with my nizzles.  I got there a little late, but here is a recap...  We had a little food and fun and listened to Amanda Shelby.  Afterwards we drove towards to Kasso's house.  There we all unloaded--, whoops...  I failed to mention that Ryan did  REAR END MANDY !  HA HA HA, it was so funny!  Then we watched a few movies and about half of us left...  I was very sad, but kept my cool and head...  From then on it is quite hazy...  I just remember random rapes, gropes, screams, threats, farts, inferrings, munching, snoozing, waking, fearing, zipping, rolling, touching, fibbing (and finding), sticking, hiding, bullldozing, watching, eating, popping, honeying (is that a verb), putting (ITCHING POWDER ON EVERYTHING I OWN (FUCK YOU SUSAN, j/k)), and other things...  To put it lightly, it was one fat fucking frenzy or just an orgy...  It was a lot of fun and happy birthday to all.  As far as antics go...  Actually a lot of stuff happened.  First of all, Ryan and my prank failed.  Too many people found out (thanks Jason and Bryan) so it failed misreably!  However, Susan succedded in drenching my entire pillow with itching powder and making me very uncomfortable.  I spanked Maggie horribly at least three times (remember folks, that is the minimum).  Oh, I also pantsed Kassovic! HA HA HA, I saw her butt!  We all had a big fat pillow fights on more than one occasion during the night.  Also, everyone did their fair share of groping and touching and the above verbs.  There is the low down!  Enjoy!  or you can just FUCK THE PO-LICE!  :)

      Maggie- I am sorry about your shin dig. I mean, the pain on your shin. See, this is why going to a show where 15 people know each other is way too fricken' crazy. Damn kids pushing each other around. Well, it was kinda fun a little, but only becuase we knew them, otherwise I would have thought it completely obnoxious... I thought the night was pretty entertaining the whole way through excpet for the very end which put me in a piss-ass mood.   Nevermind, I don't want to talk about anything now. I am reminded of being pissy. Dammit.

      WORSE THEN LAURA'S LESBIAN JOKE: Doctor Dave had slept with one of his patients  and had felt guilty all day long. No matter how much he tried to forget about it, he couldn't. The guilt and sense of betrayal was overwhelming. But every once in a while he'd hear that soothing voice, within himself, trying to reassure him: "Dave, don't worry about it. You aren't the first doctor to sleep with one of their patients and you won't be the last. And you're single. Let it go......" But invariably the other voice would bring him back to reality: "Dave, you're a vet...."

      Hey guys, I am not sure what to write about today, but I felt that you guys all needed some imput from me.  Why I said that, I have no clue.  Damn.  I just felt like saying that too. Oh, is there anyone out there because its getting harder and harder to breathe ::pant, pant, pant::  MU-HU BITCH!!!  Oh, I had Ryan going for a while.  I told him that I needed surgery on my eye where he hit it with that damn dark chocolate (I hate dark chocolate even more now.  In fact, i loathe it now) I told him I woke up and the blood had spread.  It was like I was looking through rose tinted glasses.  I told him I would have to wear a patch for the rest of my days.  Sigh.  Then he called me and I lead him on some more until I almost burst out laughing.  Then I told him it was all a lie.  He said he was relieved.  MU-HU BITCH!!! ANYWAYS,  she said something that I couldn't believe so I grabed the stupid bitch by her nappy ass weave.  Started talking shit and what do you know, I reached back like a pimp and I slapped the ho.  Don't you love Easy-E?  You know I do. Ah, I'm not gonna spend the night at the par-tay just so you all can decide not to since the life of the party won't be there.  Damn I'm acting like a concieted bitch tonight.  MU-HU BITCH!!!  See you all on the morrow.  ADIOS BITCH!!!

      lol, congrats to laura. ^_^  and yeah, thursday was weirdy. we should do that again sometime. ~_^  i think i'm gonna spend the night at the party, even though i know i'll be the first to fall asleep.   HEY, WE HAVE A NEW TRADITION!!!!!!!!!!!!! okay, so yeah, lemme explain - thursday night, it was me, billy, carlie, and jason in the target parking lot. and there was this random cone over by the starbucks. so we took it, and it's at my house right now. i named him Bucks. but yeah, so our idea that we made for a tradition was to bring Bucks with us wherever we go, and leave it at someone else's house each time. or like randomly drive to someone's house and leave Bucks there. so yeah. whadduya think???  and also, i have something for us to do. for the play, we need a lot of rocks, so we could go rock-hunting one night, or whatever. i wouldn't be able to go tonight, 'cuz i have to be in bed early for field hockey tomorrow. but yeah, rock-hunting. whatevers.   keep on keepin'.

      I know this probably doesn't mean too much to you guys... but I didn't fail my math final!! I have a B... AND I AM FUCKING PROUD!! Even though it isn't an A, like you all, but trig is difficult for me, so shut up.  On another note, strange things are going down this weekend, I can feel it. It's a vibe. Thursday was pretty strange and that isn't even part of the weekend!!   Who all *is* spending the night at Mandy and Laura's Party anyway? Someone fill me in like Craig David.

      ahhh.... guess what guys? i got two AA's in ddr today.... on insertion and midnite blaze... that's what happens when i have too much free time on my hands. eek.  okay, on another note, someone has to seriously stop my bad coffee drinking habits because obviously, i cannot control myself... it is definitely not a good idea to have coffee at 10 pm... i think this possibly means more ddr for me! >.

      oh wow, i forgot to answer questions  okay, so first, the 3 wishes **1: TO FINALLY GET RID OF THE GODDAMN BABY FAT ON MY STOMACH THAT NEVER GOES AWAY!!!! **2: to be successful in whatever career path it is that i choose **3: to have the power of mutation/transformation   and in regards to billy's last question, i would rather have no genitals at all than wear them on my forehead. i'm with maggie, i'd find it pretty disgusting - you guys know how squeamish ((yes, squeamish, hehe)) i got when we watched "american pie 2" at mandy's house that one time. so yeah, val's going with abstinence. ^_^     GOOD LUCK WITH FINALS!!!!!

      aww i hate pointlessly posting at this time of night because most people are headed to their lands of slumber, and i'm up like a hawk.... just like... anticipating... yeah.  um, regarding genitalia, seriously, that's really gross to have either a big pussy or penis just like staring right at you... awfully disturbing, since you know what, i don't think penii are very attractive. actually, i could deal with a lack of genitalia.. it'd probably be easier... with lack of a vagina, what happens to menstruation? maybe a nasty thought, but really, a life without periods would be good.  shopping sounds pretty okay, it'd be cool to go tomorrow, but i'll just probably end up shopping saturday morning anyway.. i've found that it's hard for me to successfully "shop" for things with other people.. heh heh... and shit, that makes me mad about the underwear. i totally just took a shower and grabbed the blue ones.... ahhh.. how could i... anyway, stupid coffee this afternoon is making me extremely hyper again... aww shit.... whee... i'm gonna go sing broadway show tunes to myself now. night all.

      Okay you guys, for those of you interested in a text-based game, go to  urlLink http://www.kingsofchaos.com/page.php?id=58023  and sign up! It's nothing fancy, but a simple attack, earn money, buy weaponry game where you play characters similar to Lord of the Rings. I know it sounds boring, but what are you doing with your time, eh?? If you sign up, it helps me out even, and you all get to be part of my army! woot!  Ahh, the simple joys in life. I suppose this is what I get; me not studying for finals means me finding alternate interests online. Entertaining, right. I am super worried for my Trig final becuase my grade is *right* on the edge, and I would need a high A to raise it... and, well, that's not happening. Fuck. Oh well.  For tomorrow: Yes, let's lunch it!! I'll be fine with any form of edibility tommorrow even, so you don't even have to fret about that... Just fricken' choose and I will abide by it! haha. Yeah I sound like a little bitch!!  OH and Billy... Si, estoy los pantalones rosas de Brian.

      ooh, wow, i'm gonna take a rain check on that one, cause i just realized i never answered the three wishes one first wish: fame and fortune. wait, is that two? ok, fine, fame because of fortune. second wish: good weather for the rest of my godforsaken life. mu hu. thrid wish: hmmm, can't think of any... well, ok, that's a lie. but anything i think of is either immoral or somthing i'd probably be sorry for asking for, so i'd better just not do it...  and for billy's most recent question.. eh.... alright, genitalia on the forhead. i mean think about it this way: no genitalia at all means that you miss out on alot.. not saying that having genitalia on your forhead is twice the fun.. but uh.. yeah, you can see where i'm going with this.  i totally need to be in on the shopping extravaganza... i'll be at rehersal with val till 2.30, so maybe we could figure things from there...? hopefully... seeya then, and have fun with yoru finals...    AND FOR GODSAKES, WEAR YOUR BLACK UNDERWEAR ... hahaha

      Would you rather: Be the only human being with your genitalia on your forehead or Not have a penis (balls are included) or vagina at all! ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I say:    "I'll take the dick on my forehead, I would look so becoming!" I don't know why I asked this, but it could be becasue I am so tired from my 2nd day of finals.

      Hey Guys, DAMN SENOR SMARE!!! We were on the road to victory, ahead 3-1, 4 minutes left, and he subs in the shit players.  And guess what? Lincoln, our rivals, are able to score 2 goals in the 4 remaining minutes!!!  Damn Mr. Smare and his subbing incapeablitlites!  We tied Lincoln, and they are shit.  Shit I tell you, SHIT!!!!  Grrr...arg! Well on another note, I hope your guyes finals went okay.  I'm sure I failed Chem and Bio, but there's nothing new on that note.  Also, what are we doing after school tomorrow.  I have practice 1-3, but after that I'm free as a bird (have you ever seen that Daria where she gets grounded for staying out late so she plays the harmonica and her dad asks her to stop so she's like, "When I play this old harp, my soul flies..free as a bird."  I love that episoad!)  On another-nother note, I might be able to get the truck, but Jason, don't get your hopes up. I'll try to set up a Marissa taking the car, but its not a guarentee.  Oh, if you are shopping, (this might sound a little concieted) but you don't have to wait for me, my presents have already been purchased.  While on the other-other-other note about the party, I don't think I am going to spend the night.  No offense to anyone, but I don't really like spending the night at peoples houses unless I get to sleep in a bed (if you know what I mean).  So anyways, if my damn computer will reconnect to the network, therefore the internet, I will send this charming compostion.

      Okay,  just got back from work and I am pissed.  This little girl doesn't know shit about hebrew so she screws around in class.  Today, she sits down and says "i wanna go home" and "i miss my mommy and daddy".  I stand there (like an anal-retentive and meticulous--  whoops, sorry Jason) and I just ignore her.  Finally she stands up and screams and starts crying...  Then she runs in the girls bathroom and wails like a whore!  MY GOD, I WAS SO PISSED! Jason:  Yikes, I would be pissed @ Burnside.  But, since we all know that she is  right ...  I wouldn't take too much offense.  Maggie put it best when she told me: THE TRUTH HURTS, SORRY (actually she never said that, but it would have been placed well in some of our ol  d conversations).  You should feel lucky, Ms. Burnside speaks in Yiddish with me, I feel so violated. Ryan:  Not all fat people are bad...  Me... um... er...  Okay, maybe fat people are mean, but hey!  They are fat!  You'd be a dick too if you got a chub on when you heard the opening of a McDonald's wrapper.   Oh yeah, don't blaim your gay swimming crap on Liberals, I guarantee we aren't to blaim.  Tomorrow:  I thought some people were going to the mall to get presents for a few Birthday girls?  If we aren't I don't mind, but I don't want JOHNNY ROCKETS...  It is too expensive and I think it is particularly vulgar.  I just want to go someplace  close ,  cheap , and  big enough  to accomodate a lot of us. With that crap said I am going to do my Newspaper article...  I hate newspaper's final, may it never bother me again, ever!  Oh yeah, Laura a embrasse Brian.  Nous avons embrasson huit-temps!  Elle est une rose pantalon!  J/K

      ryan that really blows.... i trust that most swimmers have the responsibility not to let their um... well as you put it, "dongs gingle"... (except for chris *trauma trauma*) ....but really, that is over the top... she has no evidence, and god knows what her kid *really* saw.... it's life, it's full of penises.... i guess that's something we all have to learn to live with. now if like, i saw jason's penis, i think i would  definitely  take that one to court, but really, she is exaggerating way too much... i mean hiv? that's crazy.... maybe she is just a lesbian and highly bitter. i don't know. you always seem to meet very funny, odd, and silly people. lucky you, huh?  i say she's the bitch that  really  gets the "tar and feathering".... mwa ha ha...

      ah! ryan, that is so terrible! dern woman... ugh, if any of you ever have small daughters, i want you to  make  them see boys in a girl's locker room. i swear. they should just get used to it while they're young. escpecially if none of the people involved are even remotely naked!!! erg...  jason jason.. online orgasms.. oh my...haha, and as for burnside, well yes. just don't think that you can do anything without her talking about the negative side of it... just..yeah, don't.. haha  i hate journalism with such a passion right now.   not to mention that my chem grade is totally screwed. ok, well, that's not true, but seriously, even if i get 100% on my final tomorrow, i'll still be 7.1 points short of an a. dammit!   whew, ok, had to vent. but i'm ok. really... haha, i just keep telling yself that in 15 hours, it'll all be over....

      This board is getting crowded.  I'm pissed tho--- a woman accused all of us swimmers of 1) being naked in the girl's locker room 2) having sex there too 3) spreading HIV with razors while having sex 4) running up to six year old girls with our dongs gingling.   The woman said that her kid had to be taken to the hospital for trauma due to our free balling, sex, and disease spreading.   First off, doesn't that sound a tad over the top????  Second, how the hell would we be allowed to do that?  We won't swear in front of our coach, not because she is religious, but because we seriously fear the reprecussions of SWEARING.  Imagine fucking!  We'd be wishing we were dead in hell.  The woman's complaint was taken seriously by the Campbell city council (fuciking stupid ass liberals) and the whole accusation mess is going to court and our coach may be fired.  Damn that woman!  What really happened was that the coaches allowed the boys into the girls locker room so that the girls could shave our legs.  We only shave up to our knee, so we had jammers on.  NO PENISES EXPOSED.  This is a tradition in swimming... nothing new or unexpected there.  I wanna kick this woman in her boobs and tell to her get a life... swimming is an open sport... expect girls/guys shavint together.  But don't start going ballistic and lying about us spreading HIV!!!!

      second preplanning idea. first off, i am NOT giving away any seats or promising any rides until tomorrow, except the drivers seat to carlie if she lets me drive the truck. i don't really care where we go, but as i recall jenny doesn't really like hamburgers (johnny rockets is rather expensive anyways). Further notes: AP hist was easy! selfridge let us down! (ok, maybe not)...bio was easy too...and english was the hardest of the day, with those annoying quotes, especially the last ones from the poem. @maggie/jenny: i hate you. both of you. greatly. and i have no relations with adam!! and, as a special presentation, this is what burnside said to me today (copied from an IM with jenny)  Thirteen Master (4:09:24 PM): o, guess what burnside said to me when i came back with my journals for her to check? Riceinmynose (4:10:00 PM): neway what did she say? Thirteen Master (4:10:43 PM): i had counted them beforehand to make sure they were all there...and i gave it to her, and i said "there's 19 there"...and i expected her to count, just to make sure...instead she says "jason, you're anal-retentive and meticulous enough that you wouldn't lie to me, so i'll just take your word for it" and gives it back Riceinmynose (4:11:15 PM): 0_0 she SAID that to u???? Riceinmynose (4:11:16 PM): omg Riceinmynose (4:11:21 PM): did u think it was funny? Riceinmynose (4:11:29 PM): i mean i would have been pissed as helll Riceinmynose (4:11:44 PM): but maybe i took it wrong? Thirteen Master (4:11:52 PM): no, i gave her a look, kim started laughing, but i thought it was pretty funny Thirteen Master (4:12:00 PM): it was actually a compliment as to my honesty  studying for trig, blah! when you have a 97%, you don't need to study!!

      hey i just had a fairly decent idea.... most of ya'll are online, and it seems like we will most likely be going to lunch tomorrow, so let's plan in advance! here are my suggestions for tomorrow's outings, so we don't get stuck.   in and out (yes yes yes) johnny rockets maybe  i don't know, i'm feeling like fast food that's not so fast... no honey for me though. =D  ride wise, tomorrow should be interesting. hmm. oh well... off to mobilize for trigonometry. have fun with second day studying everyone.... je vais preparer pour mon examen de francais que je deteste beaucoup.... la classe de francais est tres bete et stupide, mais c'est amusant que jason ne peux pas lire la texte de francais.... oh la la... j'ai de la chance parce que mon examen est oral.... oui oui, jason aime les examens orales beaucoup.... mu hu!  heh. au revoir kids.

      4 goddamn finals...draaaaaiiiinnnneeeedddd.....  okay, so maybe tech theatre didn't really count as a final, but hey, i stayed up past 12 doing it too, hehe. and then of course i show off my brilliance by forgetting the sets at home. so now i have a late grade on my final, but i figured i'd rather have a late grade than no grade at all.   but yeah. blew through my spanish 2 final, even though it took FOREVER 'cuz we had 150 questions, and Gerber made us listen to that goddamn Spanish tape with the people with the thick accents who talk too fast. "actividad a - listen and choose. blah blah blah blah blah" and yeah, then i went to math, and for once in my high-school life i can say that i'm confident about that final. i'm really happy, 'cuz this is like the first time i've had a solid A in math since 7th gradish. but yeah, val did good on that final. happy happy joy joy. history is another story...was only a unit test, but still, i'm not too thrilled about it. i didn't get to study for it, but then again, i never study for my history tests, so yeah. we're hoping for a C+ here, peoples!!! ~_^  and yeah, okay, i'm talking too goddamn much, so yeah, laterz

      Now, let me clear my throat.... dun dun dun Hey know what?? That History test was EASY CHEESY. I studied for 30 minutes yeterday and said "fuck it, it won't help my grade" and I still know I did well. A wnderful feeling of  not  wasting time, for once. But now I am worried for Trigonometry, Spanish, and possibly Chemistry. I have a Trig grade right on the edge, so I am a little sketchy as to where it will end up going. *crosses fingers*  Raise the roof!!! (hey hey hey) I am having a major music lapse, you guys. I busted out the Jock Jams mp3s and CDs. Someone needs to buy me the Pulse CD. Haha, well, actually, that could cause some majoe brain damage. Eh, well, as if there isn't enough already.

I know all the bio I will need to know (and then some thanks to   THE PLEASURE ZONE,  EMMANUELLE 2001 ,   EROTIC CONFESSIONS, and  THE BIG HUSTLE .

      yes, finals are bad...very bad...way past my bedtime (shut up maggie)...too much at stake...I HATE 89.95!! yes, anyways...how'd the study group go without my genius? um...personal notes: maggie/AP bio people: i think the test will be curved lower than we thought before. a score of 31 was higher than most people, and that's out of 50 questions. therefore, i'd expect around a 34 or less curve knowing how prichard thinks. billy: the answer to your rhetorical question is: it crawled there on 7 of its eight legs. jessie: um...can't think of anything, had something a sec ago though...o well, good night, must sleep for finals, after studying for them

So, I started studying again. Biology is rough, very rough.  Thank god for the notecard, mine will be freaking full!  That bizatch will help pass me! Another thing!  I just saw this huge-ass spider crawl on my wall as I was watching the Osbournes!  SO BIG!  I killed it, I was so pissed!  HOW THE FUCK DOES A SPIDER THAT BIG GET INTO MY HOUSE!  I don't care what the answer is Jason, it is a rhetorical question so don't answer... Back to the old drawing board so I'll see you all tomorrow!  Screw school and beware the spoon!

      okay everyone, study group at my house at 6... don't know if this will really work or not, but we'll see right? a variety of subjects should be covered, but i have a feeling it'll mostly be for history and bio. so far, billy and ryan are coming, so it'll definitely be a par-tay.. come all, you are welcome. we'll be here a bit.  secondly, i think i am going to pull through with the science camp counseling stuff first week of feb, which is essentially two weeks from now. if anyone else would like to go, please notify me by the end of this week so i can get you guys paper work and let the people know... don't leave me... all alone... haha...  until then, i am gloating in the glory of my d+ on the last bio test... *sigh* see all you crazy people tonight.

And lastly, where is the study group?  Maggie's?  My parents, reluctantly, said my house is okay (but I'd rather not use it).  If it is in fact at Maggie's when?  Just call or IM me.

      ah, i had good times today...  i like being dirty billy. it's kind of nice...   haha, speaking of billy, here is a little except from our conversation displaying our favorite bitter jew's indesicivness:  LlamasAttackedMe: 	yes orgy on thursday urinalpotts19: 	no urinalpotts19: 	okay  haha, yes, that's right kids. thursday is orgy thursady.. wear your black underwear....  anyhow, my arse is sore and i need a shower. but it was all worth it. i got some studying done (i actually got a good dent in my math)... cubing (which still sounds dirty to me, by the way..)... i mean listen to this : "I had a cubing threesome with bryan and ryan. bryan really knew how to take the lead, and man, could ryan work that pelvis.." so wrong. so wrong. and yet so right....haha

      hmm...not the most productive day in my esteemed opinion, but i saw it coming. what do you expect with a park for cubing? cubing>studying. no matter though, what's done is done. as for tomorrow, i need to stay after school and get a few things done, and depending on my schedule i don't know if i could make it to a study group. but remember the BIO NOTE CARD. use it well, fill it with your hearts ramblings on the calvin cycle and whatnot! cubing improvement: billy, it's not the hard to stay relatively clean if you LEARN TO NAVIGATE. except for a few times when i slipped right off the block because of a sudden stop, i stayed pretty clean. feet and hands can give you plenty of control, although i guess something like newspaper wrapped around the legs and rear would keep people cleaner.

      I had fun at the park!  It was great cubing despite the fact I was totally saturated in mud.  My dad pitched a fit, but I didn't care.  In the future, lets methods of staying clean!  Like using ponchos or trash bag suits!  I think I would enjoy cubing more if I got less dirty.  Are we having another study group tomorrow?  A serious one at someone's house, because the park doesn't work.  I am not even going to mention it to my parents yet or at all for that matter, so consider my house off limits.  Sorry.  By the way, I am making  a list of things we can do when we get together.  Just put anything you can think of that is free/cheap, fun, and close to put on the list.  Once it is complete I will share and things should be more fun.   The spoon beckons , au revoir!

      haha... someone has to tell me that jason's away message sounds horrendously wrong at the moment... it is "bathroom and food"... is it just me, or is that a terrible combination? if i called you right now, would you be in the bathroom eating? anyway, i hate you for waking me up.... i don't know if i made any sense on the phone... that is the absolute worst time to call me.. to wake me up when i am still delirious and can hardly put words together in a cohesive sentence. but it's okay, i told someone to, so all is forgiven.  no odd dreams yesterday for me, i think i missed my rem sleep by a couple of hours... heh heh.... and btw, it was sigur ros, a little bjork thrown in for spice. i like my icelandic women.  three wishes, eh? well good of you to contiune the hypothetical questioning billy, this is awfully hard to answer... first off, i would say world peace, but then that would make things booooring, silly as it sounds.... so maybe i'll phrase it as "violence to a lesser degree".... second: to kick all the residents out of my court and turn it into a music venue, as well as open the long dreamt of, infamous "store".... third: hmmm.... more wishes would be too much... wait, i know!! i want  urlLink these damn shoes .... if i had these, life would be perfect. moo haha.  off to shower. i smell like late night televison.

      you want three wishes...ok, here goes. 1. that the IQ bomb really existed and worked 2. that those who survive the IQ bomb would live for a long time 3. more wishes as well, or to be the absolute ruler of the world  study group: my seats are taken by val, laura, maggie, billy unless you can correct me. study group: we do have the option of studying at mandy's instead. under present circumstances, i prefer that option because a) it's cloudy and cold outside; and b) there are no bathrooms at the park  dreams: if i did have a dream last night, i don't remember it and usually don't remember any of them.

      I had zero dreams last night...  I used to get some weird dreams but not anymore.  I don't know why either!   Oh well, it'll be fun to study @ "make-out" point today.  It'll be pretty and fun!  And cubing!  Hurray!  Oh, I will not be bringing the spoon.  It is too dangerous to have in public.  Jason, Maggie, and Salcido are threats and therefore I shant be bringing it.  Sorry Val, i really wanted to show you it.  I now some of us hated the last question that Ryan asked because it was so random, but I gotta ask: If you had three wishes that would come true, what would they be!  I said: 1)  Pokemon really excisted (c'mon, that would be friggin awesome) 2)  That everyone of my friends and relatives lives to a ripe old age and does not die of disease, murder, etc. 3)  More wishes!  Or if that doesn't work, I want to become a super hero and save the world.  My power source being the Spoon of truth and power!

      AH! Bjork? Dancer in the dark? maggie going blind and getting hung? ah! ok, i still think about that movie too much....  ah! you too laura? i had a SUPER weird dream last night  i was in wyoming and maggie was there, and all of a sudden she's like "aw shit, i gotta go home and take care of jenny because she's sick. but i have somhting else that's really important to do" and she wouldn't tell me what the other thing was, so i kinda gave up and told he that i would go to her house and watch jenny while she was out. so i did. and it got really late. it's was like 3 am or somthing, and i was just sitting in her room on her computer while jenny was sleeping. eventually i got thirsty so i went into the kitchen for H2O..and maggie's parents were there. and it was really creepy, cause they were sitting at the table, and maggie's mom was doing a crossword and her dad was reading a paper, but they were in the pitch dark... and how, they basically were really freaked out at first, cause they had looked in the room and seen the back of my head and just assumed it was maggie, then maggie's mom walked me home...veeeerrrry odd.  that's right jason. run. run far....but you'll never be safe...muahahaha

      Ai, Maggie, by Icelandic music what are you referring to? Bjork? Sigur Rs? I have no clue how to put the little oomlot on Bjork, but... excuse it for the time being.  I had a really freaky night yesterday. I kept waking up in the middle of my sleep and thinking that I was with someone, or rather, someone was in my bed with me.  It was really freaky. Of course, no one was there, but it just kept happening. I was trying to figure out if I was dreaming it, and then got the spiritual world mixed up with the real one after I woke up. But then I wonder- what was I dreaming about? I remember one dream I had, Billy had the spoon, but we went to some park with a pond, and he put his spoon in the water and it inflated to the size of his head. That was a comical dream... But there's no way I was thinking about *that* when I thought someone was in my bed. *shivers* It still freaks me out somewhat!

      ahhhhh shite! i just wrote a really decent entry, but then i just lost it... grrrr at the internet... anyway, it went something like this:  i was griping about how i have to delete 100+ worth of junk porno e-mail in my account (yes jason, my account is always full due to porno spam), but i am also happy because although i did nothing today but pollute my brain with television, i got out and bought like 5 cds.... yay... also...  billy: sorry about your spoon, i did not mean to harm you or it in any way, but i did enjoy my 10 seconds of fame where i had your spoon and you did not. =D  jessie: i agree with your prospective vehicles of choice... the saturn actually isn't too bad at all... i don't know, i've heard that cabrios aren't exactly that reliable, so it might be good to play it safe... my dad and i had an odd conversation about rabbits today... heh... i almost typed rabbis.... oops....  laura: glad you found time to get cozy, we'll have to negotiate the workings of this page at a later date...  val: orchard valley sounds really awesome, but if it's a good day, then i say we must spend it outside! it must be easier to go cubing if it is a bit sunnier, so the ice would melt faster.. besides, make-out point is just as awesome in the day as it is at night... hee hee...  ooh! random thought! i went to a japanese supermarket and saw bidets for sale! (just thought i'd share)  jason: it's really funny to read your typing for some reason. it made me laugh. running for cover from jessie? you coward! moo haha!  well, i know i am up at an insane hour of the late evening/early early day, but um... i hope everyone is having a wonderful time sleeping... i think i shall trot off to get some reading in.... everyone listen to icelandic music... it's exquisite... i wish some people were up right now to keep me company.... i'm boooooored yet again... anyway, i'm free all tomorrow up til about 6 or maybe 7. watch, i'll be "studying", and fall asleep flat on my face when we're talking about lysosomes or some other crap like that. i smell more caffeine coming on... yes, for the agenda tomorrow, it's definitely, in order of priority: food, study, cubing...  ok well off to literary madness i go... keep warm in the cold nights and don't forget to cozy up with big sheets. =D

      Yeah, I know this sounds counter-productive, but I think we should have a mass study session for us all. Because we all have overlapping classes and such... I need to be in an AP History one, so please, let me get in on it!   Monday Plans outside of studying: Given the fact that we have the entire day basically, I say we picnic and cube while we have off hours from studying! haha. That park is a beautiful place though, even for non-cubing. I am actually suprised there weren't little make-out pairs up there. Hm, who knew? Anyway, back on track! Monday plans should involve a healthful mixture of food, fun, books, and people. In other words, I think we should Togo's it up at teh park with some cubes and coffee and towels perhaphs. Oh, and for those of you not into cubing, think of it this way: There is no way we could possibly spend more than, say, 2 hours MAX doing it. That is a small portion of the day, all things considered. So hey, let's have a fun one, okay everyone? Wow, this makes me feel like I am on a Little League team.  Oh and hey- what did you guys do tonight? Bet you can all guess who I did. I mean, what I did. ha. ha. (calm down Billy, I was kidding!!)

I WAS RIGHT ABOUT THE MUSTANG!! WHAT DID I TELL YOU??!! hahahahahahahahaha!! ok, i'll run for cover now and hope you remember that you owe me and will be merciful

      WOW!  Jessie nice car!  Hey at least you can drive!  I am also admitting on blogger.com that I have  failed  my permit test a  gain...  Meaning that I am the  worst  in the group.  Just please, don't rub it in, it does bother me.  Jessie, you don't ahve to feel bad now.  My loss was your gain, I guess that is one way of thinking of it.

      Whoops, I forgot to mention about what would happen after high school...  Well, I think that everyone that is really close in the group will continue to stay close.  Deep-rooted friendships will continue while others will drift apart.  Also, I think that some of us will end up going to the same colleges (I mean besides Maggie, who else really wants to leave California?)  I don't!  We'll all probably see eachother once in a while, until one day we won't even remember each other.  Laura won't remember Maggie's last name and Jessie won't remember why she was banned from Jason's car and we'll all go on with our lives.  It is a little depressing, but getting older means moving on...  right?

      woo.. never mess with a guy and his spoon....hehe  i'd love to do somthing tomorrow.. i'm probably not gonna join in on studying for ap, but somthing at the park sounds good. whether it's food or whatever...just give me a call or somthing.  ugh, val: i DO NOT feel like doing my tech portfolio...grrrr...hehe  car update:ok, so it's narrowed down to two cars basically (Note that none of this is really my descision except for the color.. it's kinda my parent's choice now. so don't bitch at  me ..hehe) either a 2002 cabrio or a saturn sc2... it's actually rather snazzy for a saturn. (check it out here if you're bored: http://www.velocityjrnl.com/jrnl/2002/vmd2725ov.html)... but the cabrio is a convertible, and that's just too exciting...but the saturn is a bit more economically practical. it also rides 2 inches off the ground. so i don't know. it's a give or take, and liek i said, it's not particularly in my hands anymore :( poor johnny feels so neglected...haha.. anyhow, see yall tomorrow hopefully.

      I don't care when we do the study group.  I don't know if we should do it on the hill either.  It could be really distracting!  One this is for sure, homework and  CUBING  (that is what it is called Maggie, not "cube") do not mix.  Homework is too un-fun and cubing is too much fun.  I'm putting out this next message to all that oppose me having the spoon.  Beware, the spoon is strong and shall stay in my grasp!  For those attempt to take the spoon...  Death or another unlikely happening will follow.  I was particulary angered yesterday when someone tried to rape me of the spoon.  I swear that if the spoon leaves my being the person who took it will pay.  I will use black-mail, bribery, and other such bad nouns to get it back.  This means you Maggie, Jason, and both Lauras.  The four of you are walking on thin ice now and one more aggressive move from any person will mean  bad stuff !  I'm sorry I had to say that, but last night I was pissed!  Beware!  The spoon means death for those that oppose it and for those that support glory will follow.  Have a good night sleep, my fellow nigtits!

      tomorrow, for all of you with AP hist/bio, i'd like to arrange a study group. time/place are flexible, but please post/IM me with your schedules and location preferences. we'll probably go though the chapters 1-12 or 13 of history and 1-10 or 11 of bio tomorrow, and the rest on tues. unless someone has a better idea.  maggie, if we do the study group at the park, i don't think cubing at the same time is a good idea because it would be pretty distracting. i'm fine with the picnic idea though.

      wheee.... i know i've said this multiple times before, but i still think that it is awesomely rad that so many people are posting, with such lovely comments and whatnot. anyway, i am really hyper as of now, too hyper to work on this page... although laura, i am sure we will find something good to do to it, it sorta matches right now, what with the colors and the image.... get it? on the rocks? pictures of rocks? har har har...  yeah, yesterday at hogue was pretty fun, really cold, with lots of random people walking about, but still, i was just extremely glad to get out of the house, even if it was for a mere two hours. are we doing stuff tomorrow? write your suggestions all! if tomorrow afternoon is sunny, it might be pretty fun to cube during the day. a picnic would be pretty awesome too. (just some ideas, since i know we are all very bad at thinking of them.) >.  in other news, i am banned from coffee for today, seeing as i had two frappaccinos (yes, i know that is spelled wrong), which is quite bad... but ooh yummy yummy.... by all means, jessie go for the cabrio!! whooo... or get a hummer... haha, now THAT would be amazing.

      Wait guys..what happened last night?  And Jessie, about the new car.. a new cabrio or an old one.  Old ones aren't too reliable, new ones aren't the most reliable either but that would be really cool.  You guys know how ryan went to that parade in San Francisco, right?  I'm watching the video he took of it, and it's pretty halarious!  Him and Brad are having a heated argument with this guy over Bush and things.  Anyways.  Yeah

      okay, i was randomly looking around at websites, and i got to this one guy's page, and he had a list of medical terms that he thought would be good band names and stuff. but anyways, so i was looking at it, and there's this one disease called Maple Syrup Urine Disease. so i went and got some random info on it for show-and-tell, hahaha.  * * *  Maple syrup in urine disease is an inheritable metabolic disease of amino acid metabolism characterized by acidosis, central nervous system symptoms, and urine that may smell sweet like maple syrup.  Causes, incidence, and risk factors      Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is caused by the inability to metabolize the so-called 'branched-chain' amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The disease is called MSUD because urine from affected people smells like maple syrup.  In the most severe form, MSUD causes severe acidosis during the first week of life. This is characterized by progressively poorer feeding, vomiting, seizures, lethargy, and finally coma.   Untreated infants may die in the first few weeks of life in severe forms of the disease. MSUD also occurs in an intermittent form and a mild form. Even in the mildest form, MSUD results in mental retardation and bouts of acidosis precipitated by stresses such as ordinary infections. * * *  happy little booger, isn't it?? apparently it's even fatal to adults, so yeah, wow, i learned something today. i thought i'd share it with y'all and maybe you'd be enlightened...somewhat....i don't know what point i'm trying to make, so never mind.

      prom - jason, you're my date for prom, remember?? ~_^  tehehehe. but really, i'm not sure if i'm going. you guys should really go - believe me, it's totally worth it, and it should be one of the most memorable nights of your high school life. it was for me last year, so yeah. i'm serious, it really is a stellar event, and i really think you guys should go. i don't know how i'm going to pay for it, since i think my mom isn't going to cover me for it 'cuz she needs to focus on marisa since it's marisa's senior prom and stuff. and i wouldn't want her to, anyways, since it's gonna be marisa's special night and stuff. i think everything should be directed towards her, but yeah. i got a vintage dress off of ebay, and it looks okay, but it smells of smoke, and i'm not sure if it's something that i would wear to prom. otherwise i'm seriously considering making myself a dress out of duct tape. that'd be awesomeness. ^_^ i'm kinda hesistant about going to prom 'cuz of the whole thing with john, but it really hasn't been bothering me, and i shouldn't let it bother me anyways. and i don't care if i have a date or not, as long as we all go together then it's gonna be stellar. 'cuz we have more fun with each other as a group anyways. ^_^    and yeah, are we doing anything tonight?? i can't stay out that late 'cuz i've got field hockey tomorrow morning, but it's a really nice day outside, and yeah. someone please call me if we do something  and yay for bryan with his license!!! ^_^  i think he wins for having the nicest car. but yeah  fun stuff.

      Val: I feel your pain, I am also not in CSF (because I don't see the point of what is does) and will not be attending Davis.  It's a good thing we have side groups to hang out with.  As you have mentioned previously, you have The Drama Crew and I have...  Cortland, John, and...  *sighs* Dawson's Creek...  Don't ask!  Oh, by the way!  VAL, you are right.  A synagauge is hebrew for temple.  So, therefore, Val (I think) is right  Maggie: Um, not to be rude and not to pry, but why Vegas?  The last time I went to Vegas was for my Grandparents wedding and man was that fun!  But, then again, I was only nine!  The whole time I played video games with my cousin.  And seeing that you are older, can't drink, can't go to strip clubs, and many other things I really hope that you find some fun to do.  It shouldn't be that hard with a stinky-booger-daughter-of-a-hoe!  Jason: That sucks about you being a chaffeur, I don't feel your pain because you can't drive, but honestly:  SUCK IT UP!  IS IT SO BAD THAT YOU HAVE TO BE NICE TO YOUR BROTHER OR YOUR FREAKIN' FRIENDS FOR THAT MATTER?  I just wanted to open that wound as a representative of the NERLC!  HE HE HE!  LONG LIVE THE NERLC

      billy - thanks for about the skirt. ^_^  and hey, i'm currently debating with Jason at the moment over something - isn't a temple the same thing as a synagogue?? meaning that they both relate to Jewish people. or something like that. but yeah  damn all you people for going to UC Davis and leaving me all alone. blaaah-haaaa-haaaaa....i went to Davis with marisa and my mom over the summer. it was alright, i kinda liked it. the classrooms look kinda shitty, though. but yeah.   carlie, that sucks about marissa and dave. best wishes to her.

      arrgg...my mom has the flu, along with some sort of throat infection, so guess who's stuck as my brother's chauffer? me, of course. i hate this...i have to pick him up at 10 from kendo instead of doing something else. i might "recruit" (read: draft) one of you to come along with me, if i feel like it. Billy, i'm gone this weekend, in fact, i need to be home by 10 on friday. i have a race down in hollister saturday morning, then i head to Tahoe. and yes, UC Davis really is just to get out of school...why do you think we chose Davis and not Berkely? we get a charter bus and insurance that everyone misses 8th period (that was before they got rid of all 8th periods)

      Man, it just is not a good week for this group...  To add to the misery, my tennis team which I much anticipated blows, big time.  First off, all the good people left and left us with one senior (who isn't really that great), and handfull of sucky juniors, and a few sophmores and freshmen.  We suck balls.  I have never seen such crap.  And, the worst part all about this is that they are all playing VARSITY.  EVERYONE!  Even these sucky weiners that really should play JV and actually get a feel for the game.  For example...  Andy Goder, is no where near super, but is okay...  He is half of the number one doubles VARSITY team.  What the fuck?  And, to top this little festival of fucknuts off, the coach is a jerk.  He made me just serve for about an hour.  For those who don't know tennis...  Serving for an hour is boring and killer on the arm!  ARRGH!  I honestly had a great day today, it was super.  Then tennis just popped that little balloon of happiness.  God have mercy on me. Carlie: sorry about what happened to Marissa, I know they had been "together" for quite some time.  That does blow!  I think that maybe it is better for Marissa to not be with Dave.  We all know Dave is immature, and this action just prooves it.  Marissa deserves someone more mature, like...  Um...  Er... Maybe Jason (he's pretty stiff as a board-- I mean mature...) Note1:  For those that are in CSF, enjoy your trip to Davis.  I would like to have gone, but I get enough information on Davis from Lisa Hardy, John Hardy's sister.  And from what I have heard (I.E. from Ryan's mouth) it seems it is just going to be "a jerk-off session" in the words of my father :)  If that is in fact the case, i'd rather spend my time @ school doing--  Ah, who am I kidding, have fun without me... Note2: Are we doing anything this weekend?  I need to know, because I am getting rather booked and to be honest, there is a Jewish event that i would rather not like to go to, but I need to have an engagement that I am already committed to...  You know what I mean, it's Emilia and she is nice, but I find her rather annoying.  Just let me know.  Also, please tell me who can do stuff this weekend. Note3: I've spoken with multiple beings in this group and each of those people have mentioned a retreat...  Are we going to go do something during Spring Break?  Go camping?  Anything?  Maggie mentioned driving to Mexico and I can only speak for myself when I say that I would rather not go there.  Ryan, do you remember that story about Sarah going to Tijuana with 3 eighteen year olds?  Ha ha ha, that is some funny shit. Note4: Val, i never got to say it @ school, but the tape skirt is off the hizzle.  It's pretty sick DUST (NOW, IF ANYBODY CAN TELL ME WHAT MOVIE "DUST" IS FROM (AS IN MOVIE) THEY WILL WIN A COPY OF MY GHETTO RAP CD (HOWEVER, IF YOU ALREADY HAVE IT, YOU WILL NOT GET A NEW ONE, HE HE HE))

      ay ay... this is muchos odd day... most definately....  alright, first is first, billy, i shall contemplate a smaller list to contribute to your big one. yes, your big one...  Dave, in my opinion, is a TOTAL ASS for even starting to be like that. Jason? Ryan? you listening? If you just sparatically decide you ever "need your space" when the girl you're dating is perfectly normal, don't be an ass about it, or all of us with y chromosomes are going to come give a a swift kick in the behind and throw you in a tank of pirahna infested waters. with Dave. or what's left of him anyway....  Laura, that major sucks about tu madre... i know she was totally into that job and such too... a sincere wurd to you mamma... yeah, i do agree thought hat at least they were decent to her. none of this sparatic change of emotions like such (AHEM) assholes (ahem DAVE).  I didn't have too terrible of a day, but it was rather adventurous. i had to go to cupertino to get this random cd for drama, but a way different way than i usually go, and got lost. i finally get there, only to realize that they're remodling the damn thing, so they moved it temporarily... and the madness doesn't stop there. i find my way to the new place, get my cd, and walk out to find that i have locked my keys in the car. Luckily, i have my cell, so i start calling everyone i know (my mom's super sick and high on allergy meds, so driving isn't too good to her, and my dad's in LA). But alot of people are at practice for whatnot and i just can't get a hold of anyone. I look inside my car and see my frappachino, melting away without me. AAA says 3 hours. 2 minimum. It starts to rain. I look at my sweat shirt through the window and think how nice it would be to wear it. My cell battery is dying because of me calling everyone, and the library's closed. finally (yes, there is a good point to this story) my mom randomly pulls up. I was both mad at er for getting out of bed, cause she looked like she was dying, and over exuberant about me actually having some warmth. so yeah. that was my unexcitment of the day.. oy oy...   just another manic monday.....

      I agree, a load of shit!!  I bet he cheated on her and had sex and caught a nasty rash that is spreading around his body and he knows she will find out... Umm, Just kidding, of course.  That's retarded... psht..  KNOW WHAT ELSE IS LAME?!?!? ...my mom getting let go at work today becuase it's just not in their budget anymore... Grr, today is a very bleh day for most.  They are giving her a month of pay and a great letter of recommendation... all in all it is pretty good; the office people she works with were really upset by it, too. I think it's one of the prettier loss-of-job experiences I have seen, if you can imagine it.

      Hey again, I thought you guys should hear this from me although I don't know if Marissa wants me to talk about it.  Marissa and Dave broke up today, well actually Dave dumped Marissa because he needs his "space and time to think."  Thats the BIGGEST LOAD OF SHIT I'VE EVER HEARD if you ask me!!!  So, tomorrow if you see him in the halls or even talk to him, give him a big, mean, nasty look or kick him in the croch.  Thanks!

      What the fuck...  Val!  Where did you find this stuff?  Ha ha ha!  I'm reading this journal of crap and I am honestly tempted to write in and say: Hey, what the heck?  Seriously, there is some crazy ghetto Dawson's Creek crap going on in that web-journal-diary...  Do you honestly think that the people that say they are Aaron Carter are Aaron Carter?  I'd be curious to find out, in fact some little hoe-bag said something about them all lying.  Oh well?  C'est la vie! Note1: I am making an actual list of shizzle we can do when we go out.  I am tired of just driving...  It sucks like a porno star, so with that analogy clearly stated I would appreciate it if any person were to share their "enjoyable activities" they would like me to add to the list.  Okay?  Word my posse.  Oh, I just realized something...  Never turn porn on when your sister might be home...  Never.  Swear to god, I rarely look @ porn (i mean it to) and when I actually do, MY SISTER COMES HOME EARLY!  All those with siblings and who also enjoy a good self-hump...  Make sure your sister is not coming home early or you aren't coming home late (I would also like to add, i did not get caught!  THANK GOD FOR LOCKS ON DOORS THOUGH!) Note2: I do enjoy a good fast-food burger/hotdog/other fatty product, but I am seriously suggesting that perhaps we could eat @ a restaurant...  Maybe once every month?  And, since I did mention hotdog!  Weinershnitzel wasn't half bad.  I hated it for about 5 years, until...  When did we eat there again?  Oh well, it was okay. Note3: FUCK THE PO-LICE Note4: I think I am going to make a screen name up called: JASON_HATAKEYAMA ...  Comments?  Questions?  I'd appreciate all input!

      carlie: i suppose it depends on the outcome of the tryouts mostly, and how they affect the game schedules, since it might not be worth it if soccer conflicts with the games tuesdays and thursdays. if not, then i think you should continue to do it, only if it isn't interfering with other aspects of your life, etc. practices on friday are sort of eh, but whatever, i probably won't go to half of those anyway - there really is no point to them. do whatever you feel like, but remember that beth might be sad if you leave her partnerless.=/  AHHH I HATE HOMEWORK. lates, chums...

      ay, the bosstones and four non-bblondes? carlie, you are a confused little girl..hehe  yeah, i don't want to go either... no fun at all.. i was going to do some homework stuff, but than i remebered i have to organize this whole church thing before tomorrow...gahhh... so i go to the coffee shop, and forget all of my stuff, so i have to go back home. when i go back the second time, all of the stupid yuppie old people have taken all the tables! it was a madhouse in there..totally full.. and too cold to go outside, so i went and locked myself in my room (wwiiiith the lights off...haha)... anyhow, all of this leads to me extremely not wanting to go to school. how? i don't know... at least there's only a few weeks till spring break...  hmm, and carlie, i do not know. i cannot know your situation exactly.. i think if you can make it work somewhat, do it, but if you have to murder yourself in the process, maybe just chill at open gyms and stuff... ah, how terrible of advice is that? haha, yey for reiteration of what you just said...  and maggie, do you really wanna live forever? forever? forever young? hahaha

      Sorry, Maggie.  I'm not going.  I have soccer tryouts at 5.  I think I'll be going on tuesday though, if that helps.  I don't know though if I should even play.  I'll only be able to practice on tuesdays and fridays (how ghetto is that, practice on fridays from 5:15 to 7:15, that just screws up any plans we have or plan to make).  My mind is constantly wavering about the topic.  One day I'm like, "I don't think I'm going to play, it will make my life so much less complicated if I don't play." And then when I went to practice over the break I was like, "Oh, I remeber this and how much fun I had,  I want to make this work."  Ah, I don't know.  Help me.  To play or not to play?  Please help me, I'm so confused (maybe).

      forever young... i wanna be... forever young. and not go to school as well... here's my two cents on my homework status: i literally have not done anything. i read the awakening, i suppose that's good enough, oh yes, and half of the history chapter, but i am afraid that's all. i really gotta get cracking, if ya know what i mean.... ahhhh.... *kills time* i do not want to go to school tomorrow at all. but on a different topic, how many people are going to b-minton practice tomorrow? i want to, but i shall need to devise a clever scheme on how to get there at 5.15. grrr.... okay, well i am off to procrastinate some more. until tomorrow, *ddr style* peace out!

      Nice dream Jessie.  And I was thinking about tinfoil today, too.  Interesting.    Damn english essay and theme journals; the only homework I haven't done.  I don't want to, I want my mommy.  "I wake up in the morning and I step outside and I take a deep breath and I get real high. And I said hey whats going on. I said hey-yay-yay-yay, i said hey.  What's going on?"  "Have you ever been close to tragedy or been close to folks who have Have you ever felt a pain so powerful, so heavy you colapsed No..well I never had to knock on wood and I'm glad I haven't yet cause I'm sure it isn't good.  Thats the impression that I get."  These two songs are stuck in my head.  Damn songs.  They don't mesh too well.

      ...i have an energy hangover....haha, it was funny 'cuz when i came into my house, my mom asked me what we did, so i was talking really fast and crazy-like, and so when i was done talking she asked me how much coffee i had had to drink. hahaha. i told her a venti caramel frappuchino and 2 "caffeine drinks." but yeah. my legs were shaking soooo bad and stuff 'cuz i was that hyped up. when my mom was done watching ER i got to play ddr....and okay, you  know  you're hyper when you're moving too fast even for ddr....i was playing the matsuri japan one, and i was WAAAY ahead of the arrows, it was crazy. i was sooo energized that i even dared to try La Senorita, and i actually passed it!!!!!!!!! which is crazy shit, 'cuz on the basic level, La Senorita is 7 feet. but yeah. did that for a while, then did my part of my chemistry group project for today, and then i put on "the wedding singer" once again and fell asleep on the couch. so yeah. but fun fun, we should do the driving adventure again sometime. ^_^  jessie, that's a pretty weirdy dream, but fun fun at the same time. ^_^  looks like maggie is getting around....**nudge nudge**wink wink** tehehehe. ~_^  hmm, me getting arrested for stealing/driving a golf cart....that kinda sounds like something that would actually happen. ~_^ fun fun

      jessie, jessie, jessie... tsk tsk. sure it's orchard valley and not *cough* cosentinos? and for the record, i am not a slut, nor have i ever even formally spoken to john! goodness, i'm a tool even in dreams... how sad is that... haha, nah really, it's all good though....  i'm in the best of moods, even though it's *checks clock* 2 AMish... haha amish.... okay, whoo... friday was totally fun, and today, well for me, was astounding!! i'm sure that no one really cares, but while driving around san francisco, who should i randomly see but some really hot guys walking down o'farrell street, before i notice it's todd and beck from my most favorite band in the world, glassjaw.... it was a miracle. i literally jumped out of the car, and was um, "causually" speedwalking down the street, but i was too late... they had already gone in to sound check. seriously, how cool is that though? i feel like a little teen bopper kid, but really, if you liked this band as much as i did (think of it as 3290584604 more times than a burning water), then i think you would be spasming all over too.  this evening was completely fun too, good times, good music, good company. what sort of wrapped up a good day was the fact that i had a strawberry shake (mmmm...) and happy parents to come home to.  ooh, and if people get a chance, ya'll should see  the life of david gale . it's very good, even a little bit trippy at times. but in a very marvelous way. ryan, it's a movie you would like. it's "smart" enough for you. and it has kevin spacey! no one can deny kevin spacey, at all.  until then, much peace, and remember to pray for those deceased grandfathers of loved ones. -_-

      and i'm back. glad you missed me...heh...  anyhow, i'm just here, downing a box of grahmn crackers, wasting some time... ok, so i had this dream, and i have to tell you all about it:  we were hanging out at laura's house, and maggie pulls me aside, pulls off her jacket, and shows me this big old pen tattoo that she drew on her arm. it's this big gaudy old thing that says "HANS". she's all "you like it?" and i was kinda laughing and i say "sure." and she's like "yeah, see my mom had this thing that once you have somthing on your body, it might as well stay there, so i think i'm gonna go get it." next thing i know, she's heading for the door to get this tattoo... Then jenny blows up the microwave and everybody's running around trying to clean up.. i remeber somthing about carlie and tinfoil..haha..anyhow, i'm thinking about geting a towel or somthing, but laura comes up to me, and says "BRIAN'S HERE!!!" and i look out the window, and sure enoguh, there he is. and she says "should i go out to talk to him?!?! hehe, i don't know" like all giddy and stuff, and i'm just thinking, "laura, it's your boyfriend, what are you gonna do, leave him out there?" (oh, it's not over yet). All of a sudden maggie runs out of the halway. turns out she went to change or somthing, and she's wearing these really slutty clothes. she's ripping though the place, grabs me by the arm and says "oh oh, and john (brian's friend) is here too!!! i'm going to go out and talk to him. when i'm done, come and get me" and i'm like "how the hell am i supposed to know when you're done talking?" but she's already out the door, TOTALLY hanging on john and bending over in front of him and stuff... and finally ryan calls me over to the other window , and val's stealing this golf cart (like the one's at school) well, ok, she isn't stealing it, just driving it around in circles, and we're laughing, but all of a sudden this cop sees her and starts running after her, and totally arrests her...so we just keep hanging out...   haha, so yeah, that's what sleeping in hotel rooms gets you... i figure y'all ahve to do homework and stuff tomorrow just like me, but if anyone wants to hang out for a short while or somthing, t'would be nice. call mi cell phone. i'll be down at orchard valley probably around 2 if anyone would like to join. until then, adeu.

      Hey guys.  Some pretty weird shit happened since the last time I read Blogger.  Can we please do something today (friday), I am almost bored out of my mind!!!  Okay, maybe not but I think I'm feeling a bit of cabin fever.  Even though I'm not in a cabin.  Hum.  Just incase you weren't aware, the women's soccer team played in Berlingame on wednesday against Berlingame high school for CCS.  We lost 0-1.  Their goal was offsides but none of us wanted to play Mitty on Saturday or continue practicing the rest of the break.  On Thursday I went to an aquarium in Santa Cruz. It was pretty cool.  It surprised me how much we've learned in Ap Bio was aplicable to what was there.  Anyways, lets get jiggy with it tonight.  Maybe can we hang at someone's house.  I don't want to drive much.

      Thanks for the caution tape Val!! I put it up at practice today... looks very Branham.  While I was driving to your house I ran across 2 cops... one was using his front bumper to push a car off the road.  The other was trying to block traffic.  Hella cool.  I wanna learn how to push a car with my bumpa.  I DROPPED 4-6 SECONDS ON MY BREASTROKE TODAY AND STAND TO DROP EVEN MORE TOMORROW!!! WHOOOOO!!!  The coach working with me at the clinic thinks I may make CCS this year (if the Q time is still around 1;06).  WHOOOOOOO!!!  My car blew a tire overnight so I got to take the van out today.  I had fun peeling out of red lights and blasting KSJO full volume.  Good times.  I left the windows down on the freeway (MISTAKE!) and my hair went spikey and looked hardcore.  Laura comes home tomorrow... lets think of something fun to welcome her back!

      How's Tahoe Laura?  Hope you don't hit any trees or knee-scraping, bone-breaking, life-threating things like that.  I nearly got killed TWICE on 680 yesterday.  A big rig nearly slammed one of its 16 wheels into my head and a (race to be ommitted) driver nearly flung me a few lanes over as she randomly decided to merge.  Fun stuff.  I'm doing this swim clinic thing at Independence High (which is why I was putting my life on the line on 680) with a few Branham swimmers.  Kendra was trying to get my attention during one of the lectures by waving and winking and wispering at me (I was too entralled by the video of swimmers going back in forth in a pool that I didn't notice her) and this Mexican wannbe thug (dressed semi nice so he isn't a thug, semi-thug tho) thought she was hitting on him.  So, when she walked over, he looked her up and down and said, "Hello sexy."  She snapped her neck around and said, "I wasn't talking to you.  I wasn't looking at you."  It was so funny!  The guy was so embarrassed... he shut up, froze, and turned around trying to pretend it didn't happen.  Oh god that made my day yesterday.  Even better... is that this semithug that thinks he's hot shit can't swim faster than GINA!!! GINA!!!! THE MINIATURE M&M AT BRANHAM!!!  Plus, he's a cheerleader.  Hearing that made my day, too.  A cheerleading semithug.  Hehe.  Oh yeah, on top of that I was changing in the locker room and in the entire time that it took me to shower, strip, and put on real clothes, he had put 6 different lotions/sprays on.  Friggin insane.  A girly, primping, cheerleading semithug.  BTW --- Yesterday I had a near death experience(s) on the freeway.  Today I was wearing sandals coming out of the shower and started slipping in a puddle... kept slipping and dancing around (moon walk mostly, a little bit of the cha-cha kick sometimes, and a slight robot move with teh arms as they flayled) to keep my balance for about 5 (not kidding) seconds before grabbed a chain link fence to support myself.    I came back at 9;40 and Jason wouldn't answer his cell.  Where'd you guys all go tonight?

      Sorry Val... I woke up to the alarm and decided my butt was too comfortable in bed and slept through practice.  I don't have morning practice tomorrow, but I'd still like to pick up the tape.  I'm scared to swim against Independence now... their coach is way too good.  One of the guys (coach, not kid) is an 18 time all American with several world records.  He teaches so well it's like I was playing violin and traveling half way across the world to study under a master.  I'm seriously thinking about taking a month of school swimming and "studying swimming" under him on his team.  At the Biology thing tonight I encountered the stupidest woman ever.  Through a thick Russian r-rolling accent and a beer-belly chin, I could barely make out her stupid questions like, "So to get college credit what do you have to do?", which she asked 3 times sucessively despite the answer being written down in the brochure she waved in her hand as she talked and the three crystal clear explanations by the host speaker.  Ugh.  I shiver in pain, disgust, and boredom to think of her child(ren).  Anyone up for a quick dinner tomorrow?  Fast food or cheap eat place like El Pollo Loco, Baha Fresh, etc...

      You know, this weekend, to me, was fun and all, but I think I am missing something. I know that sounds pretty lame, but it is entirely strange that in the midst of both my friends and pink pants can I still feel void.  I suppose it is one of those things that really doesn't even have to do with people, but just having issues with yourself. I am one of the most indecisive people on the planet, who gave me permission to have friends as cool as you all?? I guess what I am trying to say is that perhpahs I feel guilty for feeling shitty when I am surrounded by great people. I know we have already established the fact that I am a sap, but truly... I don't know where I am going with this, I just needed to vent. Welcome to an online journal, folks, no, it isn't just arguing over what to do every Friday.   I guess that all I need is a little push; a little reassurance... I'm leaving for Tahoe on Tuesday, and I am coming back Friday. Damn, I am missing practically the entire break. God, I don't want to go. *sniff*

      Hey guys If its stormy tomorrow or whatever, i don't think we can have the picnic at my house but my sister suggested that we have it in someone's garage.  Then we could be sheltered from the rain and wind, yet still observe the wild beyond if we so desire.  I guess cubing would still work, even if its stormy.  Then it will just be extra slick, like a well used whore (mu-hu!) Anyways, we were going to try wetting it down before hand anyways so the first few rides aren't so bumpy (If you read that and take out all the refrences to cubing, it sounds kinda..ah..perverted)  Also, if we still do the picnic, what will we consume?  I'd suggested thoes pre-baked chickens that grocery stores sell, but it seems that Jason does not like them (and we can't have Jason not liking something) so we came up with sandwich supplies (you know, lunch meat, bread, condiments) and then you can just make it how you like.  We could also get chips and dips and veggies and fruits and cat litter.  Oh, did I say that?  Opps.  And finally, did anyone see Marissa Cool today?  Namely her tight pink shirt which she was not wearing a bra under?  Her nipples were really hard and it was really gross and her and Tracy were talking about it all period.  Also, Marissa and Lauryn Livengood are trying out for badminton.  Tracy mentioned that she might try out too.  GOD HELP US ALL

      *pants from the stress....* whoo.... i really need to take a chill pill.  i have had the most horrendous day ever. i was stuck in a building with overly optimistic people for like, 7 hours on end. god help me. it would really be great if people came over around 6.30 to  study  (because i really need it) and to just relax, i suppose. i assure you, we shall get work done! even if it kills me! i am overly anal today, but i think studying with some lovely people such as yourselves would make us all a bit more calm-headed. or maybe just me. i don't know. anyway, i have hellsa notes, and lots to say, so join in the fun!  and ryan, bring risk as a reward!

      ryan, no more caps for you. in other news, here's my invalid opinion on this weekend's prospects: friday: something, maybe cubing if the weather is nice, although probably not. laser tagging is still an option, although maybe not a popular one anymore. going to the beach would take more planning, so definitely not this day. friday is sort of a loss... but it's valentines day! i'm sure we'll think of something exciting.  my idea of fun: cone-hunt. gather as many cones as you can in an alotted time frame, (say 1 hour), and then regroup, and we can all marvel at each other's cone finds. actually, even just a normal scavenger hunt would be pretty fun. i dunno. it's something new.  saturday: i need to go to target as well in the morning, so count me in on shopping! then, obviously... jessica's party.... woot woot....  sunday: i don't know. i am going to napa, praying that i don't fall out of a hot air balloon, if i do.  next week: let's pick and organize in advance (wow, what a surprise!) a good day to go to the beach. i am free pretty much all next week, so whatever day chosen is fine with me...wait, except for friday. anyway, rides might be an issue cause jason won't be around, and i don't know how many people really are willing to drive 17..... but we'll see, right?  tomorrow: study group at my house at around maybe 5.30ish? history predominantly. maybe a little bit of bio. a lot of risk. possibly eggrolls. maybe ice cream. should be a blast.  good eve to you all. (oh yes, btw val, there is a new teen girl squad comic on homestar! it's pretty great... hee hee...)

      holy sweet goddam, i had to click on the "show last 50 posts" in order to catch up with everything, but yeah, anyways.  i'm up for picnic and cubing whenever - i'm busy on sunday though, so not then. but yeah, if the weather is good, then we could go out cubing before jessica's party on saturday and then head over to her place when we're done. i mean, it starts at 6, and it's dark by then, so we'd be done cubing by then anyways. speaking of jessica's party, who needs to go shopping, and who's going, and who's sleeping over??? i still need to go shopping, so if anyone wants to go shop together, tell me ((TARGET)). and yeah, i'm most likely not gonna sleep over at this one 'cuz i'm doing stuff on sunday.   i agree with ryan ((for once, hahaha. damn republicans.)) on the thought that we could go to the beach later during the break. 'cuz i'd still like to go, but yeah, maybe we should wait for better weather and plan out the transportation and crap. and you know, there's more beaches than santa cruz and san fran. ((i have a feeling that the beaches that i'm gonna name are all gonna be in S.C., but oh well)). but yeah, besides the boardwalk, there's that one beach with the old battleship beached on it, and then there's another one too, but i don't remember what it's called..i'd have to ask my mom, she knows these things.   but yeah, let's at least do something on friday, i don't really care what. this week has been hell, and i wanna get it over with.

      speaking of the rain... its supposed to storm fri morning... i'd rather not picknik on cruddy muddy blankets... for those who DO want to go to the beach... maybe during the latter half of the break those who want to should go... or maybe those who want to go should go this weekend anyways and have fun in a sweatshirt around the beach and hanging out in a new area.... i'm sure if jessie's parents drive we will have neough rides since only a car full of us really wanted to go anyway (i think)

      response to carlie's post: i like that park/cubing idea. as for the beach, i would prefer not to drive to santa cruz, especially with so many conflicts. with the storm coming in, it would not be a good idea to use the sf beaches, since those are directly on the ocean and subject to its very harsh currents and riptides before stormy weather and in the winter in general. anyways...me and maggie were bored, so we drove halfway to SF (as far as Crystal Springs)...yes, we were quite bored. we also found selfridge's house, finally...he owns two Hondas, a van and what looks like a civic

      God guys, we've been buys posting.  I posted last night at like 5:45, i read through 19 posted in one fucking day. Wow, and like the majority are from Ryan.  He sure took to this blogger thing like a duck to water.  Oh, just incase some didn't hear.  To celebrate Valentine's Day, on Friday we were thinking we could have a picnic in a park, probably the one we cube at.  We could get thoes pre-cooked chickens, bread, and someother ins and outs at a grocery store, bust out the blankets and lanterns and have a eat-a-thon.  We'd probably get there at around 4:30pm (or later depending on afterschool activites) and we could stay 'till whenever.  We could go get cubes if we want, keeping in mind the technique of wetting down the slope before cubing.  ON another note.  I know Jessie and other's wanted to go to the beach, but I'd just like to mention some conflicts.  Jessie's parents could drive but that would only get so many of us there.  Jason said he wasn't sure if he wanted to drive.  Beth and Mandy have an SAT class, I have a car wash at the Branham Flea Market (if you guys want to get your car washed!  come!! please?)  Also, I checked the weather again and the high would be 65, it would be partly cloudy, and it is suspose to rain on Sunday so if that storm comes in early, there may be a problem.  Also, Jessica's party saturday night.  Also, Maggie suggested that we go to a beach that does not involve driving 17. She mentioned one near San Fransico, kind of by the zoo.  The weather would be roughly the same there.  Maybe we should take some kind of group poll?  Anyways, see ya all tomorrow.

      ryan, all of that is terrible.... and you guys think i'm freaky for tailing teachers!! pshhh... it's jason who does the getaway driving anyway... ryan, really, you should not be looking at branham's site in your free time! go enrich yourself with something like  urlLink homestar runner.  whoo hoo!  in other news, fernandez told me i probably couldn't make clones of my siamese twin flowers. i am greatly saddened by this fact. now off to preserve them in amber...

      its after midnight and i'm wide awake and bored...  little did u know...  from ferndog's bio...  "Earned teaching credentials from the University of Zaragoaza, Spain and an MS in Technology and Chemistry of Industrial Edible Oils and Fats."  suddenly i feel unbored... that must have been the most pointless education EVER... i remember him telling me about working in a lab testing vegetable oil... now it makes sense... weird as fuck

      jessie ur right... damn my karma...  alright, i can't sleep cause this is bugging me... AP bio students chime in plz, i hope i can write this simply enough so other ppl aren't reading greek  So certain bacteria infections develop immunities to antibiotics (tuberculosis is one of those infections that has developed near immunity to antibiotics, in Russian prisons at least).  That developed immunity is in the DNA of the bacteria.  So, theoretically, one could isolate the immunity DNA sequence and create a second specialized sequence of DNA that would disrupt its function.  This disruption DNA could be sent into the immune bacteria via a plasmid and obliterate the bacteria's immunity, allowing cheap antibiotics to function once again.  Similar results could come from some mechanism of methylating (disabling) the immunity DNA of the bacteria.  Make sense? Plausible?  Done before?  Jason?  Carlie?  Maggie?  Looking at some abstracts of research, and it seems like methylation is being tried now.

      haha, good call ryan...  while i see all of your points very much so, here are my thoughts. 1.first and foremeost would be jess's b.day...after that's figured out though 2. I WANT TO GO TO THE BEACH. my parents could probabaly drive us. and i have an urge to go because for the rest of the week i am being severely tortured by taking a "family road trip" to go see colleges. i think 'm going to puke just typing about it. therefore i think we should have some sort of sane social activity before i go. note: i have checked the weather, and it will indeed be decent in santa cruz on saturday....

      hmm...i'm personally against doing laser tagging on fri because as carlie said, it will be a MESS getting down there with all the friday traffic (that may not affect you, but some of us actually have to drive it)...laser tagging is open until 2am, but we all have to be back by 12, so that means heading home around 11 or before if we stay in morgon hill that long and as maggie said, this all depends on jessica's birthday.

      all these ideas sound wonderful... hell, cause they're actually ideas for once! haha... anyway, all sounds good, but jessica was also talking about wanting to have her bday shindig on saturday... i'm pretty sure she meant this saturday, but i don't know, i think we should check with her to clarify first, before we make any plans. or, i suppose we can laser tag or boardwalk or whatever for her birthday too.  personally, i think going to the beach sat. would be loads of fun, and friday would be a good day to laser tag, although i might not be able to do stuff friday cause my mom is making me help out at work. =/ if we do go to the beach, it would be hard to get rides, but i suggest ocean beach along highway 1? i think, up sort of by SF.... okay, so it's like right next to SF, but whatever... it's by the zoo. yes definitely, we need to go to the zoo and see all the pretty llamas. hooray for llamas! okay, well adieu until tomorrow...

BTW, are you guys going swimming or hanging out on the wharf/boardwalk?

      i'm in a good mood after three quite exciting races...so i'll relate what was probably the most interesting races i've run in... Mile: i'm doing good, i'm in 3rd when i pass andy, who i tell specifically to hold off the lincoln guy tailing us...andy dies and can't hold him off, so i lose in the end sprint by less than 1/2 a step because i glanced back once. too bad andy could buy me another 1/2 second...but i beat andy, so that's good...but since i lost by so little, i was pretty annoyed, so i walked up to campbell and said "i'm annoyed, so i'm going to run the 1/2 mile" 1/2 Mile: i'm once again doing good, in 3rd in the last straight sprinting against this guy...i'm in lane 1, he's in lane 2. then he breaks my 1st rule: do NOT EVER cut me off, especially when it's the last straight when you're not allowed to change lanes...so (and i really didn't mean to do this at all) the back of my hand glances off him, and he goes flying out into lane 4...i beat him, he's disqualified for cutting me off...then the lincoln coach comes up, and i end up getting disqualified for pushing him. our sprint coach said it was a bad call since i was defending my lane, but no one else cared much...campbell found it quite humorous, all the other branham runners were congradulating me, and quinn shook my hand when i told him the story...but i wasn't annoyed anymore, so it was worth it. my dad has never gotten disqualified, by the way. and my mom was annoyed that i'd pushed the guy, but i don't care. 2 mile: i was worried about the guy who beat me in the mile, so me and andy started off really fast and he dropped back to run with adam...i held on to andy until lap 7, when i ran out of energy...we'd been talking most of the way. so i got 2nd in the 2mile ok, end of story...i'm happy

      shut up. i'm sick. really. i'm not shitting. haha, sick to the point that my mom's making me wash my hands both before and after i use the computer... not to mention wipe down the keyboard when i'm done.... haha, oh you wish i was joking.....  ok, here we go with responses: val: yes, the play.. you know how i said i wouldn't be there friday? looks like i won't be there tomorrow either.. well, i'll stop by before hand to show people what to do and when, but that's about all i'm gonna be able to do.. not to mention that smith will kick me out for the "not there for 2 of three periods" rule... so yeah, i will bestow my "retrieve the nasty sweaty leather jacket" job to you...hehe. yes. i love you that much. ;)  billy: aww, man, i bet sean had a cow again huh? well, basically my situation consisted of the yearbook nazis (i love you maggie and carlie....haha) were holding both of the cameras hostage on monday and tuesday, and my camera is kinda out of the picture (no pun intended) right now. so yeah, my advice? um, hell, i don't know. have either heather or bell take the pictures whenever they can... sean's probably gonna complain that we missed this week's x-box club meeting. cest la vie. tell him to find out who the winners are, pull them out of class and wither do head shots or stage it. and kristens... wait, ok, sorry, my sickness is overwhelming me, and i can't rememeber what her article was... i don't knwow. call or write me or somthing... oh and by the way, did anyone ever attempt to teach that girl to write or what? i mean, she's a really pleasent person, so i feel bad saying things about her writing abilities.. or lack there of.. but yeah.  manday:yeah, and outing would be quite lovely. i have to be here for easter. we're having a easter sunrise rock service at my church that's going to be a little too kick ass to miss..  ryan: ok, first off, it's about time you got that thing out of your foot. haha, you know, people ususally don't leave sharp dangerous objects  in their feet  while they go about their daily lives.. weirdo...haha... and yeah, i really am sick. that positive sounding thing.. yeah, it's called optimism. more than can be said for you and your gonad fucking ways... ;)  did i mention i'm going slightly insane locked up in my house all day.. i mean, you guys know that i'mnot one that's much for just sitting.. ugh.. i even started to think what would happen if i was like the lady in  the yellow walpaper , but i only got as far as the though of me trying to rip down those damn sltted mirror in the living room before i just got too freaked out. thank god...

      Yo.  I got the glass out of my foot today... took 4 hours!!  The doc stuck a freakin 2 inch needle into my poor foot and the whole damn thing went numb.  Then she fiddled with her blade for 20 min and said she couldn't find the glass so she called in other doctors.  I thought I would never be able to walk again cause I'd have glass in my foot for my whole life.  But, while the docs were coming, I looked at my foot.  SHE HAD CUT UP THE WRONG SIDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  GRR  So, in went another 2 inch needle and 10 minutes later out came the damn glass shard.  Thankfully, she was a swimmer in high school, otherwise I would have turned the damn blade on her fuckin foot.  You know, I talked ot Jessie on the phone twice today... both times she sounded positively jovial... I think she's just trying to avoid homework..... :)

That is the stupidest and most obvious thing I have ever heard before!  The perpetrator of that sentence is none other than...  *ominous music* KRISTEN STEFFICK!  What a moron.  Seriously, I feel so bad for her because the other day she asked me what an outline was...  I nearly shit a brick.  Oh well, those are the shit-kickers I have to deal with in Journalism. I don't mean to bring work into Blogger, but Jessie, I must know!  I have three photos that I need done.  Sean's, Susan's, and Kristen's.  I know Sean and Kristen have submitted requests to you, what is the status on that?  As far as Kristen's go, don't worry about it.  We have pictures from Ms. Benson. GET BETTER JESSIE and don't do drugs (i doubt it will help)

(this gives you a hint as to what the answer to that question on my quiz might be.) anyway, as far as break goes, i am going to vegas/arizona from sat-tues and i would like to be in town thursday evening for a particularly good acoustic set, but i can miss that depending on what goes down. preferably, anything that fri-sun would be good, but yeah, we'll see.  as for capture the flag, that sounds fun. i got my new shoes today! yay!

      Are we doing all out capture the flag on Friday/Saturday?  I was told about it and I really think we should do it because I got Cortland and John to join in the fray!  Please, reply to this blog and tell me preferrable times, days, etc.  I was thinking that after school on Friday we could go home then all go out to dinner and then go play capture the flag at a park...  We could do it @ hogue, but I and a few other people ran into a few problems with late nights @ Hogue.  Ferrell said that we could go to McGlincey (I don't care if it is spelled wrong, you'll all get it).  Whatever!  Just tell me because I really want to do this shizzle. Murda and back to the freakin' product...  I hope it doesn't take me too long *sigh*

      k, i'm working on my career project, but anyways...  billy, have you ever been to homestarrunner.com????? trogdor is "Trogdor the Burninator," this dragon thing that Strong Bad drew. and so in the new Strong Bad e-mail, they're playing the Trogdor arcade game, and then at the end of the animation it lets you play the game, so i've gotten addicted to playing the Trogdor game. you're Trogdor, and you go around smashing these peasants, and when you smash 10 of them, then you acheive "burnination," and you have to go around burning down all the cottages. but you have to watch out for the knights and archers, 'cuz they can kill you. but yeah, that's basically it.  urlLink    play it, it's fun fun.   okay, back to the grudge of the project....

Why can't it be next weekend, then I wouldn't have to worry about this dumb ass Junior Career Project.  It should die, die and go to hell.  I hope you guys have fun this weekend.  I'll be in beautiful Lemore .  For thoes of you guys that don't know where that wonderful  deffinatley  cowless town is, its about 1/2 way to LA.  If you know where Harris Ranch is, its 30 miles past that.  SIgh.  If I come back smelling like cows, its not my fault.  And friday is Marissa's 18th B-day!  Yay! Happy b-day, which is why I can't go out with you guys.  (Speaking of harris ranch, marissa wants to go to dinner at Stuart Andersons so if any of you guys want to pop in or something...) Yeah, well, so cheer on my team, if we get far I'll probably be in some far off town next weekent to. I hope not cause thats when Aimee and Marissa are having a joint birthday party, a mi casa, AND YOU ARE ALL INVITIED!!!  The only requirement is that you have to buy them both presents.  So, i am not sure on the time but there will be hella food and hella people,so come on down!

      yeah, me, jason, carlie and laura were held hostage by butch cassidy and the sundance kid for quite a while... anyway...  i am tired of all this war shizzle even if it has just started. i can't stand to watch the news, i can't stand to turn on the tv or listen to people talk about it on the radio... it annoys me all very greatly... there was some shizzat about heightened police security and i'm thinking to myself, gee i wonder what color alert we are on now.... seriously, since when does the govt tell us how much to be timorous? my sister just told me she was paranoid, and that all of a sudden, she doesn't feel safe anymore. who the fuck has the authority to take away her sense of security? it's war; people are allowed to overreact, but crikey, the media is driving me insane by making us more afraid than we really need to be. this is just my opinion - agree or disagree.... i just wanted to get some shit off my chest because world events are just driving me crazy at the moment...  until that day... um. don't watch butch cassidy and the sundance kid unless you really dig kinky bicycle scenes that aren't even really that kinky. yeah. good night all.

I have to do Millneium Project, work, HW, and religious group meeting...  So depressing.  Actually, I can probably do stuff @ night, SWEET! Oh well, I'm gonna go eat now, but what is the due date of our Millenium projects for 3rd period with Burnside?  Tuesday?  I can't remember. FUCK DA POLICE, ESP.

      Yes, it was orgy-licious.  We screwed with someone but not in a pleasureable way.  We tried to look for you guys, we went to that pool place by Ryan's house, on Bascom.  I guess you guys weren't there.  After that we drove over to Billy's thinking that you guys would be there but no dice.  Then we drove down a random street and ended up over kinda by the Capitol Expressway Auto Mall.  Then we went back to Jason's house, and that's where the screwing began.  We were eating grapes and popcorn and were under Jason's screen names and we started messing with Val and now lets just say that we are profusely apoligizing to Val.  Note to others: If you ever want to mess with someone on line, stray away from Val. (Sorry again Val)  So we did that for like 2 hours.  I almost fell asleep on his floor.::Sigh::  Then we went home.  Fun filled but atleast we almost didn't get arrested ::cough, Ryan, cough::  Oh, but early that night Jason did roll through a stop sign with a police car right behind him.  Sadly, he wasn't pulled over.  That would have made it a night to remember.  Two run-ins witht he po-lice for some of you guys.  Fuck the po-lice and all that ass-gouda.  Damn millenium project.  It should die, die and go to hell.  On a slightly senile note: remember that Dolphin's Cry song from hella days ago?  I'm so hella listening to it now.  F that S and ass-cheese on both sides of the bagle good night!

      Well... last night, oh jeez, just... *shudders*  We picked up Billy and went to the billiards where Jessie and Jenny where, Ryan hit on some girls and it turned out Jenny knew one of their boyfriends as the ugliest guy in the world. Heh, umm, we went to Maggie's to suprise her, but she wasn't home. We went to Brian's and ate and talked about stuff, and THEN we went to the park where Billy and Ryan proceeded to attempt to light their farts on fire.  Unfortunately, neither of them got a good one saved up, and it got cold so we met up with Jessie and all 6 of us sat in her Jeep in the parking lot. At this point, we were all uncomfortably shoved in the Jeep as it was chilly outside, with a very gaseous Billy.  Not a good combination. To make matters worse, two cop cars pulled up and stopped these 2 guys that were there, and gave them drug tests, etcetera. We just sat in the car, because we didn't want to look like we were escaping, but we couldn't have Jessie drive us without her 6 months. So finally, we start getting out, but they tell us to stay inside the car.  A third cap pulls up, and this whole time we are like "well we aren't doing anything wrong" but we are all thinking of scenarios and bad situations and where to put the matches and things. So the cop comes up to the window and all he asks is if we know anything about the 2 guys and if they broke into the school and whatnot.  It was a amiable conversation except when one of them asks "None of you guys are runaways from the school, are you?" and Ryan says a joke about running away, and at first they thought he really was an escapee. It was quite eventful.   I'll never forget that one...

      You don't have to read or reply to the following, this is just a pondering me:  haha, I don't know about you all, but most of my class grades are on edline, and they are REALLY fucked up!! Here is what I mean: In english, she has only graded TWO vocab packets. Okay, so I have a hundred percent, just like everybody else. But still, that's really lame.  In Spanish, we have a total of 3 grades, one of which is a quiz I forget we had and ended up with a D on. So now I have a 79%. And it's still a goddamn C+, harumph! Why can't she include my project in it; that so would've given me at least a B. Oh well.  Funny thing is, the rest of my grades are fine and well, yay, just those two are completely off the spectrum. Damn teachers never grading their shizzle.  Oh, and in my history grade, it doesn't show that he graded the newest essay. Just the quizes he handed back. Annoying how even though I got no less than a B on the last 3, my grade stayed almost exactly the same.  I'm not asking anyone to contribute their grades or anything, but I was just rather dissappointed that the grades right now are no where near a good evaluation of our learning, since that is what they should be. Makes me tsk tsk a bunch.

      Hey!! Yea, the Sean Biggerstaff thing makes today a sorrowful day in history. Jeez, we are talking about this like he died or something.   Tomorrow: I need rides to whatever we are doing, sorry, nothing new, though. Heheh, but yes, let's do something!! Although planning may not be that effective seeing as though tomorrow's weather isn't trusty. But we can think of options!! Because you all know how much I love options. Oh yea, baby!!  In case you are wondering, which you probably weren't but I figured I would tell you anyway, I am ecstatic at this very moment! My mom and I just went driving, and I did all well and everything. It was exciting! I dropped Maggie's pants off, went to Starbucks, etc.  I was going to drop everyone else's clothing off, namely Jessie's numerous garments I happen to have in my posession, but unfortunately... my cat decided to dump over the bag onto the floor of which had dog hair on it. Now I wouldn't consider that clean, would you?  Woooo I love you ALL!!

Also, he just told his mother that he wants to "not affiliate" himself with the Mormon church anymore.  And for those who do not know about Cortland's mother should know this, she is a holy terror.  Cortland has been going through some major crap and I feel it's my duty as a pal do what I am doing, sticking by his side.  In addition, he (I mean I did it for him) confessed his love for Jessica Milton, and she told him that she liked Benton...  I think that is horrible, but it makes me laugh so much.  HA HA HA, call it one of those Burnside "twisted" humor incidents.  Also, Last weekend I didn't hang out because of a Bar Mitzvah...  This week I am not hanging out with the group during lunch because I don't want to...  So what!  And for the record... I am not angry.  I am over it!  Beth, you honestly read the conversation later than everyone else did and you can ask Laura and Maggie (I have no idea about Jason), I am not angry @ them. Beth, I will make sweet love with you if you ever give me a Dr. Laura moment again, guaranteed!

      Just as a warning this might come off as a little harsh  -Just for the record- Billy, I think you are overreacting and I think you are making a big deal out of nothing. I understand that you are upset and you have every right to be upset, but I think you are using that as an excuse to blow us all off and i don't think it is fair. We've all been mad at each other so just get over it and move on.  - I might regret this post later, but right now I'm slightly perturbed and in true Billy fashion i wanted to get this off of my chest

      jason, i don't ski. i sit in the lodge with people, read books, and socialize. skiing + me = somthing that would not be benificial to my physical or mental health.  anyhow, i am going to stay home seeing as i forgot that i'm on crew for thew play... so i kinda have to be here whether i want to or not. which i do. uh, if that made sense...   i want to go to beach. unfortunately, aol weather says that there's rain alll weekend. not sure about monday... yuck yuck.... ok, new thought than. if it's cold and rainy and we get bored, we can all come over to mi casa and light a fire in the fireplace and roast marshmellows and drink hot chocolate....hey, it's better than standing in the rain....

      yeah, cars should be fine. i told mg that worst comes to worse, we can just get a little more cozy than usualin the stang. as long as someone doens't mind sitting stick...i am also totally at carlies before prom. girlyiness to the max mutha fucka. i'm in for egging, but i think i'd want to document instead of aparticipate on this one. a bonfire is also a total possibilioty, but we have to keep the possibility of rain in mind... cuase if it rains it's gonna be even harder to start a fire than it ever has, but if it's dry, it's cool. if it does rain, my house is open as a severe last resort (aka it's my prom night and i really don't want to speand any part of it at home, but if it's required that i pull for the team, i will. so the speak. hehe)   and yey for mandy's potential vehicle! muchos coolos!

      *spills a glass of milk* *cries* ho ho ho.  so that was bad. anyway, egging sounds hellsa fun and so does pre-prom beautification, if that's what you could call it. i am down for that shizzle. oh and jessica just mentioned to me that she could not drive after prom, so there's that word up/down. anyway, i am happy today because of a) recognition and b) i just bit into sushi my mom made and this one has unagi!! yay!! *goes stir-crazy*

      Hahaha, carlie you so funny, make me jiggle in my tum-tim-tummy. (ok that was a lame attempt at a rhyme)  Hell yea i am coming to your pre-prom thingery... you can expect me sometime around 6-6.30, moreso on the earlier side. Additionaly, Carlie, is it ok if Brian drives to your house and leaves his car there since Jason is drving us in his car??  what else, what else... Oh yea, Egg Fight Information for those who have not heard it: Billy's idea (not taking credit for a cool idea that is not mine) is as follows:  *wear clothes you dont care about getting dirty, cover yourself with a trashbag so as to provide somewhat shielding from stuff. *go to park (or whatever) and throw raw eggs at eachother, basically.  COME ON you know it would be fun...  ... and I mean, what better way to end an evening of being all pretty than something that doesn't require you to look your best? cause I am sure by then we will be out of Pretty-mode, hehe. Amber said she wants to do the egg fight thing too, cause we talked about it in crafts. hehehe. And Ryan and Billy are up for it. Me too, of course. Who else?  Also... I am thinking staying for the ENTIRE prom is a little much, too, but i figure we will see when we get there. I mean, if it is really exciting, hell, i'd stick around, but if not, yea, i am leaving. Basically, i say, we leave it open to interpretation. (like the constitution!! haha)

      Seeing as my first post on this topic made such a big spash, I'd figure I'd post again, just to get the word out. Soooo... ---->PRE-PROM PAR-TAY A  MI CASA!!! UM: I don't know if you guys want to get ready at my house or what, I have tons of bathrooms and counter space and beautifying materials, so whatever.  So anytime between 5-7 are good times although if the prom starts at 7:30, i would assume showing up before 7 would be better since we'll need like pictures or whatever.  I assume you'll need to be at my place anyways cause that's where all the rides are coming from so, yeah.  I DON"T know what we are doing after Prom but there's been mention of an egg fight.  So no matter what we do, bring a change of clothes.  ANOTHER question, how long did you guys want to stay at prom?  I dont' really care but 4 and 1/2 hours is hella, so, whatever, just wanted to bring that up  AND LASTLY, don't forget your protection, cause I'm only bringing what I need, not enough for a group orgy. hehe.  I'm gonna have  lots  or fun!

      .been working on duct tape flowers all day.   *jason - your boutenneire is done, so just tell me if you want me to hold onto it for you, or if you want me to give it to you, or maybe i should give it to carlie, 'cuz it's kinda a traditional thing for a coule to pin the corsages/boutenneires on each other, but whatevers.   *laura s. - does brian know that i'm making him a duct tape boutenneire?? i was thinking about that today, 'cuz i've made it, but yeah. i kinda want to let him see it before prom so as to get his opinion on it. and i know you told me to make his black with white outlining, but i don't want to put a ton of effort into outlining and then find out he doesn't like it and have to rip it all off. so yeah, uhm, when would it be possible for him to see it??  *carlie & laura s. - i haven't made the corsages just yet, i'm still developing a style for them, but i'll definately have them done before friday; most likely i'll have them done by wednesday, so yeah.   *and i still need $5 from carlie, laura, & brian, but you can pay that whenevers.   cereal sounds really good right now.

      Billy!  Well! I personally am not working the carnival on friday, but let me tell you: i am working ALL of SATURDAY... So.. everyone come and visit me or soemthing? pretty, beautiful, gorgeous please?  Also! Friday, Laura Kassovic was (hopefully) going to take some of us a) shoe and garter shopping and b) to the cowboy bebop movie!! I know at least Maggie, Valerie, Billy, and I think Jessica were interested, but I don't know about availability. If y'all wanna go, let's, yes! Whee....i'm excited!  Tomorrow, it being Thursday: If you are really really bored or something, you should go to the Leigh fashion show, at their school, at 7. It helps their senior class and stuff.. and Brian and Conor are modeling the clothes... so we get to make fun of them onstage. =) Anyone want to go, if you do let me know becuase I can get 50% off tickets from my boyfriend. whoppe i suppose. By the way, in case you were thinking this was some serious fashion show thing, umm it's not, cause they are just models to make fun of it, and i suppose that's exactly how it will be. Heh, who knows.  LET ME KNOW... about all things mentioned. danka!

      alright billy, when anyone says "wow, jessie, that was a really psyco thig to say" it's your fault cause you brought it up ;) i had this dream last night that me and these people did this totally undercover propaganda job on the school. it was hella truth dot com. signs everywhere with really blunt saying and statements abotu the school board and stuff. then at the bottom of them, there was the e.mail and phone number of dr. farber (ok, i admit, there were some anti farber signs...farber is the hitler of cuhsd...kill farber...etc. they were really funny actually, but i guess that's a little out of line.) anyway, i was thinking about it this morning, and i think it could be frickin awesome. i fdon't know how much it would do, but i'd get a kick of seeing it all up.. so you know, if you get kinda bored on a random school night, just let me know..heh.. ALSO: the district board meeting is on the FIRST OF MAY. i say we all at least show face there.  also to billy, you mean friday probably, right? i can go in and otu or whatever as far as i know. i really don't know what my "carnival schedual" is, i'd have to see. but anytime your bored, just call me beep me if ya wanna reach me homes.  i am so frickin sick right now...

      To tell you the truth.  This work to rule this is retarded, but I really don't care.  I know I should, but I don't.  I mean, deep down I want teachers to get more benefits, more money, more respect, more etc. but this blows and there is nothing we can do!  Ms. Burnside put it best: "you all are kids, they don't give a rat's ass about you all!"  It is true, so brutally true that it blows harder than a large-mouthed porno star (I thought Ryan might have gotten a rise or a kick out of that one).  I agree with Val that we should do something.  I was thinking maybe we could do something really witty and cool and piss major people off (of course, all holic people). Also, let me get this straight...  Tomorrow night, everyone is busy?  The carnival is keeping everyone occupied?  What the hell?  When is everybody available to do stuff tomorrow?  Right after school?  After dinner?  For dinner?  Please, I don't want to sit home tomorrow and mastur---you didn't need to know that...

      val, that is totally cool. the only thing you are required to do is to have fun. if you don't, that is when we come to hunt you down.   work to rule really does suck. no more updated edline! whatever will i do?  jessie that is muy cool of you to shift dates and whatnot. i'm sure bio won't be that bad but you never can tell with the way the prich is preparing us...  and yay for el carnival... i'm going to cry if it rains (well not really, but that would suck) but everyone come and get your face painted! ok, off to simmer down some more.

      crapper dappers, i had to go back 25 posts to see what was going on...but anyways  *billy, i wasn't offended. i was just explaining my point of view, that's all. ^_^  no apologies necessary  ^WORK TO RULE SUCKS MAJOR ASS AND I THINK WE SHOULD ALL GO AND PROTEST IN FRONT OF THE DISTRICT OFFICE SOMETIME SOON  *jessie, i'll be there for your birthday ((with the duct tape unmentionables and everything...mwuahahhaaha....))  *and this is one last thing that i wanted to make clear - okay, so I want to apologize in advance for not being able to hang out with everyone on prom night. I'm planning to practically stick with Tyler all night long since I'm his date, and since it's his senior prom, and only my junior prom and whatevers. So if his friends are having pre-prom fun fun, then I'll be with them, and then I'll be sitting at their table for dinner @ prom, and I'll be with Tyler and his friends at their after-prom party, assuming they're having one. I just think it's fair that I stay with Tyler and don't ditch him and stuff, so as to make his senior prom memorable and stuff & junk like that. I'll try and find y'all at prom and stuff, and maybe I'll see y'all on the dance floor, heheheeee. But yeah, I just wanted to say I'm sorry, and get my explanation crap all out so it didn't seem like I was ditching everyone. I hope everyone understands, but yeah, okay, i'm done.   *did i mention that work to rule sucks major ass?

      no no no, no offenses at all billy, and i apologize for making you almost swear off your favorite past time. i don't know what i was thinking ;)  ok, so i won't bore you with a full vent on this one. but shit. work to rule. has basically fucked my life over. fr/ all sides. end of story.  mg? i'm glad you are nuetral.. i don't know why your are nuetral...hehe, but i guess it can't hurt... ah, maybe in the quest to have jason as a manslave? hmm, yes, maybe that.  yeah, i'm totally feelin carlie's house before prom (literally. just wait and see. heh) . yeah sounds good... but after? hmm, we need somthing good. as long as it stops raining and all, i know we could always pull a bonfire here once everything closes cause it's late or  whatev ...i would highly reccomend that we change out of our prom dresses before we subject the to flame, but whatever floats your boat...  question: so (of course) i want to have a birthdya paty (may 10th for all ye forgetfull minds). my birthday is on a saturday, but i know that some of you guys have to pull the AP bio thing, and ryan has swim finals, so  just because i love you ..heh... i think i'll move it. assuming that the play won't go up, then i can have it the next weekend. or maybe the next? i don't know. i need imput. my plan is to drain the pool and have a large sized celebration, but if anyone has other ideas, lemme know. and, by the way, this does not mean that you can forget about me on my birthday biotches. hehe. just cause it's befor the ap bio test doesn't mean that i'm going to spend the day at home with the parentals.   and ryan, come on now, you know you liked every second of it. :)

      I am excited for the carnival, too!! I am psyched for our booth as well; i like dealing with unfamiliar people and drawing on their skin... unless it is nasty-ass acne all over and pothole skin... *koff koff* ANYWAY, I'll meet up with whoever at the carnival; I have a hair appointment at 9 or so anyway, so I won't get there until some time after 10, but yea. Grr I still wish the pie-ing thing was available. You know, if we get there and they AREN'T doing that, I am going to be pissed off cause that would have been so awesome. Hehehehe, Jason, you would look good with pie on your face, it could be your original fashion statement. Heheh.  Billy- As far as dresses go, yea, it's just one of those superficial things to converse about that we all have in common. And of course you dont want to have the same dress. Also-- we went dress shopping and stuff together to get opinions about it... for instance, on a night when EVERYONE will probably look great, it is in the air to make yourself look your best, too. I personally can't tell when things look "just ok" or "pretty good" because my view is always warped. A second opinion is always nice.  And... you gotta admit, it is in most girls' nature to discuss clothes I suppose. I know it is silly, but ... I openly admit I am superficial like that.  By the way, no one was offended, I don't think. And neither am i. =)

      i'm excited about the carnival, guys! but ya'll know that there is only senior parking open that day, right?  so, if you want to drive over to my house that morning and have me and marissa give you a ride to school and then after school she can take you back to our house where your car will be waiting, there is currently 3 spots open, first ask, first serve.  also, my mom said okay about my house pre-prom.  i'm pretty sure we are eating at prom so don't worry about that.  if you want to tottaly get ready (like hair, makeup, protection, etc) then thats cool, or if you want to just come and hang out, that's cool also!  so yeah, i guess if the prom starts at 7:30(?) you can come any time like 5-7, and since thats a b day, I can do something after school if you want.  so, yeah.  ah, i like snow, and jason is my man-slave, not maggie's!

      Okay, let me say this: I was not trying to be a prick with my question.  I was just curious!  Now, I can't tell emotions with Blogger, but it seems as though all the females (and maybe even Jason) is resentful of my comment.  It was not meant to offend, anyone!  I was just curious as to why dresses are so important.  Because, the way I saw this "dress connection" was more of a negative thing.  You know, girls wearing specific dresses were made fun of, or praised, etc.  I knew about this "no same dress rule", I have seen enough teen movie to know that. Jessie...  Never compare Tchernio to you guys, that is sad.  And never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, never, NEVER mention the words Masturbation and Tchernio in the same sentence (you scared me so much with that sentence, that I almost swore off jerking the gherkin)! PROM QUESTIONS:  We are eating @ Prom right?  I mean, do we wanna go out and eat before and skip the Prom dinner?  How is the food by the way?  If the food is good I don't mind going to prom for dancing and eating.  Just curious.  And what are we doing afterwards?

      sure jason... sure you aren't  maggie's  slave...heh, sorry, couldn't resist.  billy, val is 100% right. it's not really about the dress, it's about the bonding. to the end of time, girls will have the urge to ask each other about clothes and boys constantlyu. it's a way of connecting. you know.. i mean, some guys talk about sports, guys like tchernio talk abotu masturbation... it's just a common ground  to chat about.

      fuck it, i don't even have my dress yet. but this weekend i will. for now, it's invisible.... that's my long-winded description. the cabin was fun, i got harrassed in more ways than one, but oh well.... well billy think of it this way, think of what you did to me at kasso's, and yes that is what happened for the remainder of the evening.. i have bruises to prove it. i think we should see the cowboy bebop film this friday or something, maybe earlier on.... haha it just occurred to me all the people who want to see it will need rides. eh, that can be arranged. i have jason whipped for a week. (jk.) i forget what happens in dbz. hella days ago. i don't like rpg games. but i do like final fantasy 7. billy, who are you fucked by? eh? eh?  i believe that is all. i have no homework. i can sleep. yay.

      billy, there's no real importance in knowing what a dress looks like, but the fact that we're  interested  in knowing what each other is gonna look like is another thing. and also you want to know what the others are wearing so you don't buy the same dress. i think it's pretty much okay for guys to wear the same suit because you don't really notice it ((erik shepherd and jason avila were wearing the same suit last year which was pretty funny, but yeah)), but obviously with girls it's more noticeable, and so you don't wanna feel like a copycat or whatever. you wanna be unique and stand out. but yeah, that's my 2 cents on it.   i'd like to see cowboy bebop too!!! i have no idea what the series is about really, but i like anime, so i'm all for it.   and cabinning was interesting, and amusing. jason loves snow. i made a transcendentalist snowman. ((Walden will live forever!!!!! ~_^)) and more fun stuff and junk happened, and it was the shiznay. or something like that.   Mmm...popsicles.....

      Okay, I have been gone for the last zillion blog posting, so I am going to pull a Maggie (respond to multiple things) and then vacent... Girls:  Seriously, what is the importance of knowing what a dress looks like?  I don't mean to be...  mean, but I just want to try and understand why it is so important? Jason:  I pity your soul, because I'm sure that Anne will develop a crush for you, you know, you being in your tight suit and all. To All1:  How was the cabbinning?  oh and by the way, Ryan...did you enact our devilish plan? To All2:  I want to see the Cowboy Bebop movie also, I like that show.  Oh and by the way, what happens (in the DBZ series) once Bu is defeated and Goku goes to live with Ub? To All3:  I like the snow also, I hate DBQs, and I love FinalFantasy9  (has anyone played that game?) To All4:  So Cal was so murda, but I don't think I can get into any of the schools now...  I am so fucked, so fucked Movie Advice:   See  The Big Lebowski, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, and Fargo

      DUDE i LOVE donnie darko!! Val you needa have a movie fest with us, we all gots the same movie interests, hehehe.   Maggie we still need to see the cowboy bebop movie, BY THE BY.  oh, what else... oh yea, New York = such an awesome place, we all should venture there someday, it would rock the casbah ten times harder than shareef likes it. Annnnd... i bought my prom dress too! muahahah!  If you have been to Macy's and seen this pink dress, it's strapless and goes somewhat past the knees but not all the way, and the top has horizontal folds of tulle, and then below the waist is vertical folds, and it has a ribbon? well it's basically jsut like that, except periwinkle. I can't describe it without making it sound like a lampshade, but i swear it's not! Also, I think i saw Beth's dress but i wasn't sure... Beth, does your lace part have little polkadot type things on it?

      ahhhh just reading these last few posts put a bunch of random thoughts in my head, so here they are in some sort of order:  *yeeha, i was the last person to take an illegal ride with jessie (and in the mutang too!) *val, i love spirited away.... ahhhh that movie is so wonderful, i watched it twice today, miyazaki is honestly a saint. *i actually really want to see ocean's 11 again so i can watch the movie and say hey! i went to those hotels this past weekend... when i came home the travel channel was doing a special on the venetian hotel and it was like, hey that place is familiar... heh heh... *mandy, you have the oddest assortment of movies and if we watch surf ninjas, then i am afraid i will have to judo chop you. i'll bring high fidelity though! ... clerks, anyone? *congrats to the new lovely prom couple.... remember that abstinence is the best form of protection available... anyway..... *i got my harry potter dvd too, the scenes are sorta sucky, but ahhhhhhh interviews with the biggerstaff!!! *swoons over scottish accents* *there is nothing wrong with snowboarding, kudos to jason's dad and brother...   ok, well i am out like a person who um.... goes out.... night everyone and godspeed on the trip!!  oh yes, new thought, if you haven't already, see the new christopher guest movie "a mighty wind" for some good laughs and fun times.... you'll be like.... "WHA' HAPPENED?" ho ho ho.

      ok, i'm home...jessie/val/whoever asked, yes there should be snow if not at the cabin, then a bit higher up (i don't know how high the cabin is)...it snowed at least 3 ft over the weekend and probably 6in since then, so that's not much of a worry. i also broke a tree while skiing, i grabbed the branch for balance while i was skiing through the trees and it snapped...but i dodged everything else. lastly, my brother and dad snowboareded today, so i stayed far away from them for my own safety.

      oh lordy, jessie...hahaha, it's like one of those teen chick flicks - the girl makes up a story so the guy will like her and stuff, and so then everything's peachy for a while, but then he finds out somehow that's she's been lying to him, and he gets all mad at her and goes on a pouty fit, and she's like "oh no, what am i gonna do??" ((of course it's in a high pitched voice and annoying, because that's how it always is)), and then her friends somehow manage some situation to get her and him in the same spot together so they can talk, and the guy is going to leave, but the girl is like "no, wait!!!!" and so he looks back at her with this total disgusted look and is like "you lied to me" and she has on this sad puppy dog face thing and she's crying and she gives him this whole speech about how she only made up the story so that he'd like her, and that she truly loves him and didn't want to hurt him, blah blah blah, and he's like 'but melanie ((because melanie is the type of name this girl would have)), I love you for you, and not the fact that you go to De Anza or drink Starbucks ((mwuahaha ~_^)). you didn't need to lie about all that other stuff. It's you that I love."and she's like "Oh, Jake!!!" and they kiss and make-up and it's a happy couple with a happy ending.   and yeah, crap, i totally forgot about that drama project. what time are we meeting, and where?? was it at Orchard Valley at 1?? waaargh, can't remember. shiatzhou

      sounds good to me. if i can get val to surface, we have to go work on our drama project.. maybe we could do that tues i guss... and i have a meeting at 7. maybe 7.30...haha, wow, i like how i have no clue what my schedual is... well f that s. i want to see a movie.  ok, so you guys gotta hear what happened  haha, ok, on second thought it isn't that exciting, buit here it is anyhow. so i was making a last minuite frappachino run before the barnes and noble starbucks closed and the guy at the register is like "so... do you go to de anza?" and at first i was saying no, bu then i realized that i do (yeah, i really need the caffine). and he's like "yeah.. i've seen you around here alot, so it was kinda random to see you over there.. what are you majoring in?" and i had this mad brain rush trying to think of somthing comical to major in. i was going to go for underwater basket weaving, but i wasn't sure if you could major in that, so i said theater. then i started wondering what the fuck i was talking about, seeing as i'm not majoring in anything yet...but we just started talking and i kinda just plaed along with it. it was pretty funny. so if this random guy with dark hair named mike who's majoring in marine bio asks about me, i'm a sophmore at santa cruz, taking a semester off to clear up my GEs at de anza (cause i live over there), majoring in theater with a focus on shakesperean lit.   haha, i figured if i didn't know him, it couldn't hurt, right? haha, i have a strange feeling this is gonna come back to me at some point....

      seriously?  Omg, Burnside left that there for me to eat!  Weird!  I hope this has nothing to do with Kharma, and if it does...  I have no idea if something good or bad will happen. I think i am reliving that old crepe, my stomach is grumbling

      Beth...  I'm right here!  Waiting for you!  GET GET NAKED! No lemonade, please!  Btw, I am such a fucking whore.  Check it:   I go into Burnsides class and I'm sitting there.  I get up and I see a crepe for our Lost Generation Salon sitting in the Recycling bin.  I pick it up and tell everyone that it looks and feels like a Fortune Cookie.  Burnside yells out: Alright, money out on the table people.  So, for $4.26 I ate a six day old crepe.  Hella Bling Blinging it right now.

      attest i shall. now i'm a pretty strong person when it comes to sour objects... i always played these relays when i was little where you had to eat limes and stuff, so now citrus is no sweat, but i was not prepared at all for the whorers of this lemonade... guys, it was seriosuly bad. like, not even like straight lemon juice. this shit was like concentrate. horrible... ok, well, it wasn't that horrible, but you really did have to prepare yourself to drink it before hand. then, ryan makes it worse by pouring literally two cups of sugar (oh you wish i was joking) into the things, so then it was really out of wack, not to mention a bit crunchy from the undesolved crystals...  haha, in other words, lemonade stands would be a very bad buisness for us. haha

      OK... now when I said "Is there sugar in your lemonade?" It was a SERIOUS question.  Hm. The Sparks song just came on.  I like it.  So, I nearly asked it at the coffee shop with Jessie today, but I didn't.  I SHOULD HAVE.  THEY DIDN"T PUT SUGAR IN IT!!! 100% LEMON.  I poured nearly a full jar of sugar into that baby to no avail.  DAMN SUGARLESS LEMONS!!  Jessie, attest to the horrors of that!

      hehe spank her spunky butt for me... uh, im not feeling spunky... got a letter (several pound packet) from UC Davis that told me where I'm staying.  Lemme diagram:  COW BARN & SHIT FIELD  |   .   .    .  .  **BLDG D**    COW BARN & SHIT FIELD  |               COW BARN & SHIT FIELD  | COW BARN & SHIT FIELD  | . . .  .      .   . .  . . .  . . . . .

My schedule there is such that for the first few weeks I spend a few hours in lecture and the remainder of the day in the lab (every weekday).  Saturdays I go on fun field trips to Tahoe, Monterey, SF, some other place that I can't remember, and Santa Cruz.  Sundays I don't do shit (just eat more than I need, worship, and get laid).  The last few weeks are the same, save the getting laid part, cause I don't have lectures and instead spend all daylight in the lab.  Hmm.  So yea, if you guys come up, make it a Sunday (Come early so we can go to church!!!) or between 1 and 8 PM of Saturday July 19.  That day I'm in Santa Cruz on a "mystery beach".  I don't think I"m allowed to have visitors in the cow prison, but I'll blab to my fellow inmates that you guys are avid beach goers and that I just might run into then.  Of course, I'll have to phone you guys my secret location.  I don't have a dorm phone, but I'm bringing my cell phone. I do have email there (I'll give u the address soon) and will post on blogger, but I won't have much time.

      I had a great time @ the beach.  It was so much fun!  I got NERVOUS and had good V EEE GAN food and got to swim in freezing water and not confront a drunk man and check out the hella hoes and.  Jason and Carlie need to find a hobby, maybe...  GOING STEADY?  I hear that is a good hobby.  I should try it also; BETH!  Where is my Beth?  Will you date me Beth?  WHAT?  Fine...  Betty can be a member of our sexual love triangle  Does anyone know where I can get a job this summer?  ANYWHERE at all?  The thing @ the library fell through and I would like a job, but it needs to be close (so I can walk there) and paying (if I want to volunteer I'll do it @ the Cambrian Library).  MY MOM IS AN UBER BITCH!  Lately she is just a jerk about everything, including: grades, SATs, Jobs, keeping busy over the summer, "long and short" term goals, AP classes, permit tests, etc. I am getting to a point where I might be able to sympathize with Ryan about detesting a mother...  It pains me to say it.  I would get rid of any common acronym (i.e. LOL, BRB, LMAO, etc.)  They suck and bring down the general level of educated youngsters who type on the internet.  Besides, when they become a part of modern day speaking I get really peeved off!  Like when Tracey yells out: LOL, Billy you are so funny.   I'm in for a month of hell and high water...

      haha, number 3 is going to be a must... you should really try to not use the "can i stir your drink with my penis" line. i don't think that's gonna work.   and maybe you should keep stripping as a possibility. you know, just in case....oh, the dirty jokes i could make about a girl who serves italian food...haha, so great.

      i'm bored out of my mind... i just got stuck in a closet. i was at this churhc thng in san jose.. basically just abunch of people playing really complicated brutal games.. anyhow, me and this kid were hiding in a closet for one of them. our plan was that when we heard the people walking through the room, we would run out and get them out. but the closet door got stuck, and it took people a really long time to get us out...or to even find us for that matter. so yeah, feeling a bit clostrophobic. and  feeling like i can't spell.  not to mention BORED AS HELL. and i wanna get ill so i go to the place where my chill. fellas out there tryin to make that dollar. i pull up in my 6 4 impala....  yes. that's how bored i am. i'm quoting boys in the hood lyrics. bored. definately not maybe.

      ok. so i wake up this morning and go downstairs to get a scone or two and some milk and the paper.  i look out in the backyard and i see my mom, two dogs, and a girl in a baby blue sweatshirt.  i was groggy, so i blinked for a while and realized i knew the girl... she was from the rotary club conference i went to.  we met because there was an icebreaker game where they would call out body parts, and we partnered up and had fun... after that she just clinged on me.  she's annoying as fuck, not fun to talk to.  WHY THE FUCK IS SHE AT MY HOUSE.  grrr

      Mm, good lyrics Maggie. I have decided to kidnap them and deliver them to my AIM profile. What now, biyotch.  Umm... *sigh* My grandpa called this morning aorund 9, saying that my grandma had to be taken to Kaiser in an ambulance because she was having trouble breathing. My mom started freaking out immediately and so she went over there... I don't know, I am really worried.  I hate to say this, but I am more worried about my mom freaking out then my grandma.  The way I see it is that my Grama has already gone through so much pain; so anything to help relieve it is a plus... but my mother... *sigh* she's nutso.  Mer. I'm afraid. Damnit.

      damn...  no one is one or talking.  WOOF! To all the ladies, having babies without no drama! Call it what you want to call it, I'm a fucking alcoholic.  Bring it if you really want it, ain't gotta put any extras on it! Slob on my knob, like corn on the cob, check in wit me, and do your job! Yeah, pretty bored... *goes away for about 5 minutes* It seems that this group has emotions running high.  Maybe we all need a break?

      Check it... It is about nine right now and I just woke up.  I had a really random dream about some people in the group and I felt that Blogger is also a weird dream journal.  From now on Blogger will second as a dream journal, but only real dreams, and dreams that the person finds significant.  Now, I kid you not, but I had this dream: It was sorta late at a KFC.  I was having an eating contest with three other guys and we were all eating chicken wings.  They all got spicy sauce and I got normal, I found out later that I didn't like the taste of normal.  The people in the contest were Corey Valdez, someone I don't know, and Brian Leong (s/p?).  Before we started Laura and Brian showed up together.  Coinciding with the above, i didn't like the normal wings so I went to the counter to get some chicken wind dipping sauce.  As I came back I found some sort of person there that was whispering to the occupants of the booth that were in the eating contest.  I felt incredibly angry and sad, like this guy was whispering about me and talking crap about me, oh well, in the dream I didnt' seem to care because I sat right back down!  Alright, now I didn't get to see the end of the eating contest but in dreams you go from one place, quickly to another, and mine are usually like that so bear with me!  Suddenly I'm walking home and is about sunset.  I walk up to my house and this really hot mustange (car) is sitting on my lawn.  I don't know who has one but it was neon blue and the license plate i forgot exactly, but it was something like ROSANNA'S RIGHT.  I have no idea who Rosanna is, or what the means, but whatever.  I walk up to the frong door of the drivers seat and I look into it, now, bare with me...  The inside of the car was dark and inside Laura Salcido was on top of Brian Leong.  They were fully clothed but were doing something that appeared to be making out.   Laura and Brian saw me and Laura yelled and blushed while Brian just sat there and blushed.  Suddenly I am in the car trying to get out.  Laura and Brian are trying to hold me in, but I really wanted to get out.  We were all yelling and my dad came out.  My dad was wearing wacky clothing and just looked at us and said to "keep it down".  BOOM, I wake up, done deal. I have weird dreams and I wasnt making this up.  Plan for some more dreams to be put into blogger.     It's HAMMER TIME!

      "you're the reason i cannot forget the season or the letter when you first referred to eight... and i said... it's all calypso, but it's not easy to know, you walk around with your shoulders down frowning but it's not easy to know...."  if that makes any sense to you, then that is sort of how i am feeling right now. yes, mood swings at 5 am. fuck this shit.

      Check it:  I know the AP English students have to go and see a play/musical/etc. this summer.  Ms. Clinton explicitly mentioned seeing Hamlet is possible...  Well, the Shakespeare Santa Cruz is putting on a performance of Hamlet in the Glen (which is a bar/restaurant in Willow Glen).  I suggest we take advantage of this event and buy tickets to see it together.  Here is the website, check the schedule, and then post the dates that work for you (please make the dates after August 1st?  That is when Summer School ends).  Everyone is welcome, even if you don't have AP english.  http://www.shakespearesantacruz.org/summer03/calender.shtml  With that said I am going to HULK OUT fo sho!

      We can now understand the reason why Jason is the way he is:  Thirteen Master: unless of course, this picture of me is dirtier muhuyourmom: yes, your mouth is hanging open and you look special ed muhuyourmom: that's about as dirty as it gets Thirteen Master: then you haven't found the others muhuyourmom: the others? Thirteen Master: other pictures... muhuyourmom: which contain...? Thirteen Master: me... muhuyourmom: and...? Thirteen Master: i have no clothes on... muhuyourmom: because...? Thirteen Master: i was paid a substancial amount... muhuyourmom: and where are these pcitures you speak of? Thirteen Master: my dad's computer Thirteen Master: that's why i never searched it when you were there muhuyourmom: now everyone knows about you modeling career Thirteen Master: i'm not really modeling though muhuyourmom: then what are you doing? Thirteen Master: well, i guess i'd be modeling my body...ok then muhuyourmom: and when and why did you begin this career? Thirteen Master: around the age of 6, for money muhuyourmom: and where were these pictures featured? Thirteen Master: i don't know muhuyourmom: and your parents knew about this? Thirteen Master: o, they're on my dad's comp muhuyourmom: i see, and can i see them? Thirteen Master: no...they're rather graphic muhuyourmom: is it you and someone else? Thirteen Master: yes, but i don't know who muhuyourmom: and what kind of karma sutra position are you in? Thirteen Master: there wasn't enough volume on the tv to hear muhuyourmom: how would you describe the position though Thirteen Master: we're in a bath tub muhuyourmom: and is the other person a male or female? Thirteen Master: female, of course muhuyourmom: and their age? Thirteen Master: about the same as me, in the pics muhuyourmom: and were you engaged in a sexual position? Thirteen Master: somewhat muhuyourmom: so you aren't a virgin? Thirteen Master: no

      Hey guys, the deal with the beach is that we went yesterday.  We left about 10:30 am-ish and went to half moon bay. If we woulda waited much longer, the traffic woulda been hella bad, yeah, hella!  So we got there about 11:30-ish and found this nice little beach. The water was cold and there was no swimming but we laid in the sun abd had sex on the beach (of course!).  Then about two-ish, it was hella busy and we decided we'd had enough, so we left, and since we were already like 1/2 way to 'frisco, we went there.  THe traffic was HELLLA bad tryin to get into san fran.  It took us a 1/2 hour to go 1 1/2 miles.  We were like, "what the f!"  And then once we got in, finding someplace to park was quite an adventure.  Thoes 1 way streets are quite a doozy!  So we finnaly got parked and then we walked around market and such and went into the huge ass Macy's and ate lunch/dinner in the food court.  And then it was about 4, and we went home.  So, yeah, that was it.  Damn you Jason and your lack of sunscreening ability.  That big circle of burn on my back makes me angry!  Grrrrr.

      wicked!  what is up with this darn heat?!  let me just say i hate playing tennis in 102-ish degree weather and never want to do it again!  i lost my first tennis match this season (2-6, 1-6) but it was against one of the top ranked teams in our league and me and my partner won the most games out of our team.  (if anyone wanted to know) so: beach?  when?  oh, and kasso and paul were text messaging me from the airport yesterday while waiting for their plane, and kasso said she's gonna bring kinder eggs home!  whoo hoo!

      It is cool. Yeah, the beach is just a little too warm for me.  I mean, when I go to the beach...  I swim!  It's just too hot for that.  Btw, how did that go?  I hope it was fun. I have a test tomorrow in Health and Drivers Ed., wish me luck. Okay Laura...  Truth it is: Explain in the upmost detail the last sexual fantasy you had (be honest (even if it is about doing Jason up the doo doo hole with a chestnut cheese cake while Old Saint Nick licks Ryan up)!)

      yo yo. a few side notes.  - i can't hit up the campout tonight, but i will stop by while you guys are in line to chill for a bit.  -just f.y.i, i'm leaving for camp on saturday at 1.30 and coming back friday around 3 (which will probably be more like 4 cause we always get lost). so that's where i be. i will miss you all with a rabid sense of miss-ation... it's going to be quite the long and challenging week for me. i've been in charge of alot of stuff before, but never stuff of this importance, so wish me luck.  - a song? well, i've been thinking about this for a few minuites...van morrison (it'd have to be wild night or sweet thing, but those are more overall theme songs) or do i go with hella good the used songs? maybe old skool offspring? remix to ignition?  oh, it totally just hit me. eh, it was more obvious than i thought.  days go by- dirty vegas (the remix on the radio that's acoustic but has a really strong base line.)  good ridance to spanish 1!!!!

But, one thing I dont' get...  eulogy?  of who?  who died? BTW, i'm calling B&N now to see when they think the line will get big.

      hey wow, i'm gonna post again (i just got up am chilling in the computer lab trying to polish my script for today) cause i'm not sure if i'm going to get to see ya'll again on friday before i vanish.  RYLA has been fuckin incredible.  i've changed a lot, not just in outwards manner, but the way that i look at myself.  the kids and counselors are family, we're all hella close, all 180 of us.  last night we had eulogies for 2 campers and everyone was crying and holding each other.  i've had deeper talks with these strangers than i've had with some of my closest friends.  i've gotten heartfelt compliments that left me bawling and really understanding myself, and i've said stuff that made grown men bawl too and a crowd whimper.  this camp is the fuckin shit, i feel really at peace here, so yeah.  RYLA!!!  anyway, heh last night has been on my mind a lot because it was a culmination of a lot of maturing here.  i also spent yesterday learning how to act.  i had no fuckin clue how to perform The Open Boat before, but now, its fuckin good, even i can tell.  i can't wait to deliver it this morning.  i feel like an orator delivering the work on the chapel stage. hehe.  this will be my second or third speech here- each has been seriously something i'm proud of.  i'm not nervous in front of groups up here and can improv damn well.  i miss ya guys, especially you jessie.  there have been so many times i've wanted to have you here.  u'd be in heaven too at RYLA.  everyone, and i mean EVERYONE is so frank, friendly, and outgoing.  everyone has a talent nad isn't afraid to express it.  we had some guitarists playing the Brown Girl or whatever the song is that you play.  they did a duet and it was hella good. i'm missing YOUR campfires and ur fucking laptop (typing on one just like yours right now).  people really want to see me cross dressing (apparently the swimmer look goes REALLY FAR at camp).  even this foreign exchange english lifeguard wants to (mmm, she HOT).  so yea jessie, i've got a lot of stories to tell you and a lot of discussin to do.  i trust things are going well with you... how is the bulgaria oh um belgium (sorry forgot the name) situation?  don't post, i won't be able to read this thing for a while, tell me.  i'll see you guys later, maybe sometime in august, i'm not sure yet.  one of my good friends here, gerrardo, wants me to come with him to his place in el salvador (a nice place, not a hut).  and i may ship off to africa too, to help out rotary.  whatever works out.  LATER

Thirteen Master: yes, i understand...ok, the truth is after we graduate we plan to run off to tahoe and get married, ok? Urinalpotts19: ha ha ha Urinalpotts19: nice Thirteen Master: and i plan to have her pregnant by graduation, hence why we have to run off Thirteen Master: and then, i will use my infinite talent on the slopes to open a ski resort...forget college, i've got a pregnant carlie Urinalpotts19: good Urinalpotts19: very good Urinalpotts19: how many kids? Urinalpotts19: 1 Urinalpotts19: 19 Urinalpotts19: 78? Thirteen Master: 10, all geniuses Urinalpotts19: right Urinalpotts19: of course Thirteen Master: and we'll name them after the geniuses...albert, newton, eeyore...etc Thirteen Master: and of course, there's the ultimatum...run, or play soccer Urinalpotts19: nice Thirteen Master: good altitude training for either Urinalpotts19: so, do you and Carlie do this reverse doggy style?  or the "cowboy" method? Thirteen Master: we like to do it like a horse, especially when it gallops Thirteen Master: and we'll star in the next dracula movie Urinalpotts19: Carlie? Thirteen Master: excuse me, "on a horse" Thirteen Master: um...no, she's online too Urinalpotts19: oh god Thirteen Master: yes?

      Hey from Washington D.C.!! I am having a lovely time in D.C. The people are interesting and the weather has been fairly cooperative. Today we went to Union Station and I saw an AMISH MIDGET!! I kid you not. I've been singing the "Touch my dave" song for the past two days, but I can't sing it out loud because people will just be like, "WHAT THE HELL?" My roommates are pretty cool. We're all pretty cynical and sarcastic, so it works out well. The food here is slightly shitty, but we get to have lunch at actual restaurants almost every day, which is a big plus. Actually, right now I'm hella bored. I haven't really made any friends here. They try to get us to know people by getting us to mingle, but I'm not a big mingler and half the people get on my nerves anyway, but that's just the way I am I suppose. I miss you all greatly. I hope you had a most excellent time at the beach. Tonight we're going to the FDR and Jefferson Memorials so that should be relatively interesting. I know Mandy has fond memories of the FDR memorial. It's weird because we keep going to all of these places and I have these flashbacks to 8th grade, which is slightly scary and funny at the same time. Well, I think I'm going to go to my room now or something. There really isn't much to do around here when you have free time, which is pretty sucky. I want to hear what exciting an intersting things you guys have been doing in my absence. I'll post again soon hopefully (it's a bitch to get a free computer). Peace out my homedogs.

      HAHA god jessie... that was the funniest thing i've ever read (your fatty list)... i had to wipe the tears away THREE TIMES as I read it lol  worst thing is that i read it in a full computer lab and made an idiot of myself... oh well.  syd read through it too and laughed pretty hard too.  today was pretty cool... i finished up with work in the lab way early and then went out card shoppin (and thankyou gift shoppin) at Rite Aid, the bookstore, and Papyrus (big mistake to go there).  I met up with Anthony at Rite Aid and he convinced a woman to buy two bottles of Charddonay for him.  LOL.  It cost $20 and he only ahd $16... she didn't even care.  Damn friendly lady.  Bet she could get even friendlier with some wine... mmmm  I ended up getting the lab a thankyou card that says "Thanks from the bottom of my heart"... I'm going to cross out heart and put "lung" (we work on rat lungs).  Yeah.  Nice and corny.  And I got cards for a bunch of other people too and used up all the cash on me.  Now I'm poor for the rest of the week.  Shit.  Quarters and pennies from here on out.  Anyway... I'm coming back Saturday afternoon... do you guys want to see the new American Pie movie Saturday night?

Weeeeeee!!!! ^_^  I've wanted a skateboard since 5th grade; I can die a happy girl now. ~_^  But yeah..oh man...so excited..I gotta find someone to teach me how to skate, though, 'cuz I'm pretty horrible.

      hey, I'm totally up for the beach on Saturday ((and yeah, this is coming from another person who can't drive)). I was thinking that one beach in Santa Cruz next to the boardwalk...the name of it starts with an S, but I don't remember what it's called, so yeah. But we can go to another one if we want. We could even hit up a beach in SF ((if anyone knows of one)), but yeah. So yes,  I am for the beach on Saturday.

      word down. if anyone is up for the beach, then saturday would most definitely be an awesome day for it. depending on where we would go, we could even meet up with ryan in sf. that would be uber fun.  so, who would be down for some time at the beach and then chill time at sf? i am, and i know this is coming from a person who can't drive, but we'll see about that come august 21st.   wreck 'n effects, maggie!

      Val...  This may sound crass and rude coming from me like I shouldn't have said/should say anything in the first place but I feel I should. Rock on!  It took major balls (in a matter of speaking) to do what you did.  It takes even bigger balls to tell the truth and then also such verbal blows.  Major props!  I am glad that is off your chest and now onto bigger and better things. Also, maybe I shouldn't say this either, but I never really liked JJ.  The first time I met him I introduced myself he looked at me and laughed.  What a prick, I thought maybe I was wrong...  I wasn't. GO VAL!!!

But then I realized that I don't know anyone's cell # or whatever, so I was like "damn." But yeah, really wish y'all were there, his friends are cool.

Billy, you should IM Brett for his password, 'cuz I know that Maggie just gave her livejournal password to him. His sn is PaisleyOcelot, and yeah. Hopefully he hasn't given his away just yet. And then you can join the community!!! ~_^

      Wow, I just talked with a really good friend (Aaron Elbert) I haven't seen since 2002.  We used to be best friends @ religious school but after Hebrew High we sorta fell out because we never saw each other.  I'm going to hang out with him tomorrow.  Sick!  There is nothing better than seeing an old friend!  Oh man, I'm so happy and excited, but I'm just hoping we mesh real well together like we used to.  I would hate it if we drove around for fucking hours and didn't say one thing.  Yuck.  Oh well, I'm off to see the first episode of Teen Titans.  I hope all the babies with drama can give it to Hata and be happy.  Be glad everyone.  Everyone be happy, I'm pretty happy.  In fact, I'm going to brag and say that I am relatively happy most of the time.  The only sad part of my life is being lonely every once in awhile, school sometimes, not knowing the future, death, and when I am fighting with someone in this group or Cortland or John.  I like it when you do it like THURR!  Oh man, I feel a good mood coming on.  :)

      Hey, does anyone have a password for Livejournal?  I think a journal would do me good.  I got a lot of stuff on my mind (like most) but I thought maybe I could go on and do a little venting.  So, if you have a password or code or whatever, please IM it to me or blog it?  Thanks.  Btw, what happened tonight?  Sorry I couldn't go out but I feel a little too tired and I'm really not digging hanging out.  Reason, I feel like this group communicates through journals, AIM, and blogger too much.  I don't really care, but I'm tired of going out and not talking about anything!!!  But, i can go on and read some journal and BOOM I'm done...  It erks me.  sorry, folks, billy needs a breather.

      Alright everybody, I am about to go off to hang out with my Jewish posse, *sigh* I really don't want to.  I think it is going to be uneventful and boring.  I would rather stay and hang out with this "fucking lot" but I can't. Last night was funny and strange.  I had a lot of fun and thanks for not giving me any crap about invading a designated girl area.  I will remember all of the beautiful and slutty outfits WE wore.  Have fun without me. BTW, Val, still stunned by your outfit, gestures, and pictures...  Wow...  That is all I can say...  Wow. :) Later you boogers

      You guys, I'm watching this wacky movie with Jackie Chan in it.  It is called the Big Brawl and Jackie Chan plays this asian guy from Chicago.  He is really funny.  He dresses like some Chicago hoodlum schmuck and speaks in broken English.  HA HA HA.  And he just got this chick that is supposed to be his brother's wife and she is a whore.  Major hoochie.  She was even hitting on Jackie CHan.  Oh god, Jackie Chan and his old movies crack me up.  So what is up with this group.  It has been real quiet lately and I haven't gotten any calls about doing stuff.  It is weird.  It is like some bad shit went down and I don't know...  LOL, you guys gotta watch this movie.  Big Brawl, so dumb, gotta go.

      I'm leaving tomorrow for Canada. Right now, I'm packing, and having to run means that i have to pack twice the stuff, so my suitcase is overflowing and i haven't finished the laundry to put in the rest of my clothes, since i'm bringing the vast majority of my clothes with me. O well. I come back on next wednesday, 9:22pm into SFO. Why we can't just land at SJ is beyond me, it would be much more convenient for me and carlie, since then i could give her a ride home. If something exciting happens, i always have my phone on.

      yes beth, having a peeled sunburnt pink racing stripe across your nose is the new "in" thing. duh, obviously. hee hee... no really, i don't know, but it's really not a good idea to be so bored in german that you start peeling at your nose.... let's just say that i now have a distinct ridge on my nose and it is bright pink and feels ghetto...  yours truly (and quite idiotically), maggie*

      okay- remind me not to read online journals- they just piss me off and then i feel like i can't reply to thoughts that i read in online journals because i feel bad that i have been reading somebody else's thoughts. it irritates and frustrates me beyond recognition and then makes me get mad at people that i don't want to be mad at...so no more online journals for beth (  yeah right- i don't have the will power NOT to read them- i suppose i like torturing myself

      Alright guys, I don't mean to be a stick in the mud but some of us really need to see a play...  I thought maybe we could go down to Santa Cruz in two weeks and see Hamlet?  I was wrong by the way, Santa Cruz has a Glen (wtf!!!  Glen = Willow Glen, meh, oh well).  So, just post on whether or not you would want to go or check the schedule and tell me a different date.

      Ok guys, I'm gonna be gone from sunday, July 13 thru wednesday, july 23.  10 whole days you won't see me.  While I am gone, I expect everyday, someone to post what we did as a group, then I won't feel so left out.  [boo-hoo]  and i suspose i will periodically be able to check this at some cybercafe or some shit.  if you guys miss me so much you can't stand it anymore you can always call my cell or you could just text message me, then I don't have to deal with roaming charges.  I will miss you all.  If you aren't jason, then you don't need to read any further because you might just up and barf all over your keyboard and computer moniter and I won't be there to bitch at: my little jas-ey poo, i will miss your chia pet like hair and chissled body; your condesending ass-iness and your elitest attitude, but most of all, I will miss your mother. xoxo your carlie-poo

       kay guys...very important that i know if you can come to my b-day party on August 30th.  That's a saturday.  THe part-ay would be saturday evening, about 4:30-5 at my house, we'd eat dinner and then all  pile into the fewest number of cars and drive to the game.  Seeing as i have to buy tickets ahead of time, i need to know who's coming.  SO far i think jason, beth, jessie, ryan and mandy have said they can come.  THanks!

      Laura, Im sorry. I meant to apologize around 2 days ago, but I wanted to do it in person, and get you alone for a bit, but I never got the opportunity. So this will suffice until I go out tonight. At first, I wasnt sorryI was under the impression that I hadnt even hit you, just popped 4 balloons in your face. I talked with several people the next day, and the day after that, and they werent sure either, so I did nothing. However, I had read your live journal because I needed to know what was going on, and in doing so found out what had really happened that day. I just want to say that I never intended to hit you, and that I was wrong in doing so. As Carlie has repeatedly told me, I could/should have just walked away, but I was too caught up in your antagonizing to do the right thingno, I am not blaming my actions on you, either, blame falls on me. And I am sorry for what I did. As for my pompous assness, to quote Carlie, I will try and avoid that. I never actually mean to be that way, it just happens to be the way things come out. So, Ill work on improving that in the future, although it may take a while, since I oftentimes dont realize that what I say comes out as condescending. Now that you know how I feel about the issue, and that I didnt know what had really happened, please take my explanation into consideration and understand my reasoning of the situation. Feel free to talk if you wish to yell at me or want more of an explanation.

I made an estimate, and I'd say I'm 88.6% back-to-normal now - or just for Billy, I can say 88 and 5/6% better. ~_^  And yeah, you guys, seriously, thanks for being such awesome friends and whatnot. You've all made me feel so much better just by letting me spend time with you all, and it warms my heart so very much. So thank you. ::hellsa group hug::  And duuuuude, if people aren't too tired after Berkeley, then we seriously have to par-tay tonight, 'cuz me and Barry White need to get out and boogie. ~_^

       Neal and I aren't together anymore.   ..He basically has the same feelings that I had when I was with John - he feels like he's drifting away from me, and that he couldn't offer me as much as I offered him, etc. I understood it all completely, since I had gone through the exact same things as he is right now, and so we just talked our feelings out and everything. We're definately still going to be friends - we both still want to hang out with each other, and we don't want this to end ugly. It's really great that we've both come to an understanding and whatnot. I hurt a lot, obviously, because I honestly love Neal very much, and had planned on spending the rest of my life with him - I had never felt this comfortable with someone before, and it all seemed so perfect. But I guess it was a little too perfect, and karma had to come around and get me. But like I've been telling other people - sometimes you have to take life up the ass. So I'm gonna take life up the ass and like it. Neal had asked if I still wanted to continue it out for the rest of the year, and just not continue a relationship afterwards, but I said that I wouldn't be able to do that, and so he said that that was fine. And yeah...forgive me if I break out crying sometimes tomorrow, but I'll try not to. Honestly, I'm very glad that Neal got everything out into the open. And now I just need to move on. I'm just glad it all worked out so well, and I appreciate the time that I got to spend with Neal, even though it was short. And yeah..I don't know what else to say. Go to my livejournal if you want to see the whole IM conversation: http://www.livejournal.com/users/waste_my_days take care, everyone.

      I'm actually gonna have my "party" ((even though I don't want to call it a party, but whatever)) on Tuesday...this is what I was thinking -  *seeing a movie at the Plaza since Tuesdays are matinees ((I think it's called Two-Dollar Tuesdays or something like that))  *having lunch right after at Luigi's Pizza ((my mom said she would pay for everyone's food and drinks, so yeah))  *scavenger hunt ((like how we did at Jessica's party, 'cuz that was fun crazy-go-nuts))  And then just do whatever after that. Neal is gonna be there too, and yeeaaahh. The movies that are showing at the Plaza right now are S.W.A.T., Spy Kids 3D, Johnny English, Legally Blond 2, Terminator 3, and The Matrix Reloaded. Johnny English + Legally Blond 2 are a double feature, and so is Terminator 3 + The Matrix Reloaded; so if we wanted we could see 2 movies for the price of 1. The only thing is that S.W.A.T. doesn't have a matinee price, so if we wanted to see that, then we'd have to pay full price, and yeah. I thought matinee might be coolness since everyone would only have to pay $4 at most, and yeah - if that doesn't sound alright to people, then I can change it and think of something else to do. And yeah...I mainly just want to see y'all again, I've missed everyone so much, honestly. Anyways, take care.

      hey guys. i know i just got back, but i'm off again. i have to go to my aunt's house for the week. I don't really want to go, but I said I would, and I'll feel bad if I pull out now. I'll probably be online every now and then and you can call my cell if you want. I'm really bummed that I have to go because I've barely gotten to spend time with you guys, but we can do hella stuff when I get back.

      hey...back from UOP camp. and yeah...uhm...can people hang out on Monday?? I really don't know what I want to do for my belated birthday party, but I honestly just want to see everyone again. and as the corny saying goes,  your presence but no presents.  and yeah..if Monday doesn't work out, then maybe Tuesday, and then if Tuesday doesn't work out, then Wednesday, and if Wednesday doesn't work out, then just forget it and I'm fucked. so yeah. hope you're all doing well.

      Hmm, Freddy was always a strange one, what with that striped sweater and all... I'm going to say though, that due to the nature of such a corny film... they will alliance against a greater evil, and once that is killed off, fight each other but of course, it will be a standstill, and each will wander the world aimlessly never knowing a great opponent.   Ok how about not?  What do you guys want to do this evening? I feel like eating cheese on bread. Not that that is an activity, but I think I will go do that now...

      Woohoo, the Goonies was awesome. There were so many people there and it was hella cool, although I must admit I was having a great deal of trouble staying awake. Everybody that didn't go missed out. By the way...weird shit went down while I was gone. Strange things are afoot at the circle k.

      I love beth 4 eva also. Btw, I'm going with jessie to see Freddie versus Jason.  I have seen their originals and I'm also curious as to who will win.  Any bets?  I'm thinking they both die because that would be just so climactic, right?

      the 30th looks good....  I HAVE A NEW STALKER.... i seem to be really good at picking up these fucking people. twofrom RYLA: one that knew jessie and was annoying and tried to talk to me when i was having private conversations with the misses and another that tried showering with me *shudder*.  i had one annoying one from geek camp, this black guy sam that had BORING STUPID WORHTLESS stories, the worst sense of humor, and the annoying habit of side/back tapping and shouting your name to get your attention.  oh yeah, i also got one from swimming...  this girl's rap sheet: i took a sip of her jamba juice. ONE SIP! she didn't even swim that day either, just stood outside iwth a fuckin jamba juice.  whenver i log on, she IMs me INSTANTLY... until i blocked her.  this morning, she got revenge.  luvablethistime: HEY feral ryan: hey feral ryan: who is this luvablethistime: Sarah Hollenback luvablethistime: from swimming luvablethistime: the on u got the jamba juice form luvablethistime: hehe feral ryan: hi luvablethistime: How come u bloked me on my other SN? feral ryan: cause i was at davis and the comps were slow... i just wanted to talk to close friends luvablethistime: can u unblok me now? luvablethistime: Its Tiggerrules2707 luvablethistime: Ryan?? feral ryan: well. um, we really don't have much to talk about-- i don't have much time when i sign on so luvablethistime: please luvablethistime: i need to talk to u feral ryan: why u don't even know me luvablethistime: u gave me ur screen name!!    luvablethistime: u drank frommy jamba juice..u coached me...i know u! feral ryan: i thought ud say hi, season when well, thats it... luvablethistime: so u dont want me talking to u? feral ryan: yea no offense but its kinda creepy luvablethistime: what kinda creepy? feral ryan: u IMing me all the time  (went to eat breakfast)  luvablethistime: i wouldn't IM u all the time luvablethistime: i would say like hi whats up, g2g, bye or whatever luvablethistime: ... luvablethistime: fine be that way    ADVICE TO ALL: to avoid going through this traumatizing experience, setup a second screename to FILTER those fuckin stalkers.  thats what i'm doing.  no more giving out my normal screenname

      lauras, mandy, and all others without a 6 period...YOU MISSED IT!  we had  a real code red drill.  RIght after the end of school bell rang they were like "this is a real code red drill! everyone back inside their classrooms!"  so we sat on the floor in Tandon's room for like OVER AN HOUR.  It turned out some guy who stole a car ditched it by branham with a bag that had a sawed off shotgun and the police were persuing him around branham and they ended up capturing him in the branham parking lot.  Boy, a day with two code red drill, nothing can beat that but the pain in my bum from sitting on the hard floor for over an hour.  sigh.  what is this world coming to?

      reminder: csf car wash is on that same day and i don't know about the rest of you, but i should probably work for at least a couple of hours, maybe just 8-10. other than that, those are the only restrictions for me, personally. i agree with those ideas laura - more than most, chinatown/fisherman's wharf/pier 39/market st./downtown sf/union square are all good because they are all in the general area... haight and castro are more of stretches to get to, but worth it as well... who knows... we should give a bit fat lovely san jose word up to our favorite "waitress" giselle, eh?

      Ok-- so... I know I have talked to *some* people about this, but discussion has been limited due to my not wanting to bring it up in front of people I was not considering inviting. (i.e. in the mornings, Anne hangs out near us and I thought it rude to bring it up in front of her...)  Anyway, my birthday is Next tuesday, and, rather than having a real party, I was thinking we could use it as an excuse for an excursion to San Francisco, since we've all talked about going/have gone numerous times. So here is what I was thinking, and, of course, I need feedback, because I want to know if you have obligations to fulfill, etc.:  I was thinking the Saturday one week from the Homecoming dance, November 8.  As far as times go, I know many people can't/don't want to stay out there the *whole* day, so we could leave early-ish in the morning, sometime between 10-12, and leave at 5 or so.   Again, these matters obvioulsy require feedback, so if you could contribute... please do.   As far as drivers go... well, that is one of those things we must talk about, heh.  I mean, I'm not asking anyone to drive necessarily, but I mean... if you REALLY want my parents to chaperone us around in cars... haha.  If anyone is willing to drive though, that would be a great help, and we could organize the number of people into the least amount of vehicles. (I'm sure my parents wouldn't mind us taking the van [seats 7] for optimum use)  Umm, what else... Oh! Basically, the places people have talked about going in sf include shopping on Haite, Chinatown, and that area with Urban outfitters, FAO shwartz, the Virgin Megastore, etc. etc. Although actually... we should hit up Amoeba, hehe.  Those are just some ideas, so tell me what you're really interested in and whatnot, alright? Allllright.   P.S. Afterwards... my mom and dad have a need to do that whole parental thing with food and whatnot. So we'd probably just... eat here or out, but probably not out since we'll have spent our earnings by then, haha. Well and cake. My mom is obsessed with buying me this one cake for my brithday, so ... you all have to eat it!! haha.   OK SO give me FEEDBACK, hoes!!

      I feel horrible that I made you feel like a child- apart from hating you for making me feel like shit (I guess we made eachother feel the same way)- I don't think I ever degraded you.  I tried hard to never insult you and even gave you compliments.  It's not lost on me that I can come across and rude and obstinent.  Since RYLA, I've been trying to remove the negative side of my confidence.    My confidence is my best and worst trait: it's the only reason why I accepted myself, that I am still alive today, and can push myself to do well in so many areas, but it can also be my worst because I will mow through anything that gets in my way.  You know how Tchernio has roadblocks?  I don't- cause I use TNT and blow them up as soon as I can.  (bad humor and analogies are my second and third worst traits)  My confidence comes from one of the toughest things I've ever done in my life.  I don't talk about it much cause it still hurts and I feel talking won't help.  My family hates gays.  Even now, my father talks shit about them, silently and behind my back.  My mom thinks I need to go see a shrink.  Why, am I a ward-ready freak?  I snap at her and tell her that's who I am.  How could she not figure it out?  She always used to smile and say that I was "her rainbow child."  She saw a rainbow out the window of the hospital the day I was born.  That explain two things- that I was born gay and that even God and I share a bad sense of humor.  Back to crying... everyone that I looked up to when I was young treated faggots like spoiled, diseased children.  Finding the will within me to resist that perception made me feel invincible.  The only reason why I do well in school and stuff is because I have an incredible push inside of me to prove myself more than shit.  To prove myself better than the people I grew up with.  To prove them wrong.  That's also why, no matter how nice my parents may ever be to me, I will always hate them.  My hate of them is my personality, it is myself.  I could never say that to their faces cause it would crush them, so the nicest thing I can do to them is fight.  I value my friends greatly.  Sure, sometimes I may be a pompous ass cause I'm frustrated- but you must know that I would do anything for you if anything ever needed to be done.  Thats why when one of them treats me like shit, it hurts bad and drives me insane.  The one thing that embarasses me is when someone who is my friend treats me like shit.  It makes people wonder what a crappy person I am.  I'd really appreciate it, even though it may be your nature, to make an extra effort to be curteous to me.  If we have differences, talk them out, I'll see the reason... growing up with Jason taught me to be waaaay to logical.  :)  No offense to you, buddy ol' pal.  Actually come to think of it, I may not have... I mean... the sprinklers... go figure.  So yea, when I called you a bitch I meant it, and I still do mean it if I keep getting treated like shit.  But I seriously don't want to keep meaning it.  Let's call a truce and start an experiment... in politeness.

      Ok. Well, since, like you said, I won't be seeing you, I am going to go ahead and say a few things, although you might not read this? Hmm...  I understand your point of view, but I think there are A LOT of misunderstandings between us.  The concert seat thing may have been what set you off, but after reading that, it is clear that there were issues prior. So about the seats.  I wasn't trying to be malicious, but yes, it pissed me off that you said we could have our seats back when they started playing. And they did, and you ignored us when we tapped you on the shoulder to ask you to move back.  Maggie and I are each about a foot shorter than you; we couldn't see from where we were standing, but you probably didn't know that. And, actually, I was okay with you talking to Kasso and such during the break, i understood you drove us and I was grateful to you, but at that moment I wanted to be selfish, yes.  And I *do* apologize for that. The seating arrangement wasn't exactly the best thing for anybody; some people don't care, some people did.  But the point is, I wasn't doing it to be a bitch to you on purpose.  As far as speaking to you condicendingly, yes, I do that because I feel that is how you treat me, so in retaliation, I too do the same.  of course, reading what you wrote, you do it because you think I do it first.  So of course that is a misunderstanding.  That's the way it has always been. I have, for the past lot of time, felt like you ignored me, treated me like a child, and generally a jerk.  So what did I do? Treated you with an edge.  I admit my personality is not on the nice side to, well, anyone.  My acting bitchy has never been a good thing, sure, but that's the way I am in the same way you tend to be obstinant and rude.  I'm not trying to be like "i'm right and you are wrong" but looking at the big picture, I think we both have the same problems.  We're both rude by nature, we both assume the other is purposely being an asshole just to us, and we both retaliate back.  Oh, and we both fail to realize that we come off that way from the start and then wonder why all of a sudden the other is making snide comments.  I mean, for a recent example, I totally didn't mean it in a rude way when I asked if you had directions.  I simply wanted to know if it had been found how to get ther and if we should get directions or not.  It wasn't meant like "YOU should get directions."  Not to mention the fact that I was unaware about the tough day you had had and the tire ordeal and whatnot, just like you were unaware that I couldn't see from the place I was standing.  I don't think I am always a bitch to you, and if you feel that way, then I am sorry.  Last week when we went to find bubble wrap was just fine, was it not?  Of course specific incidents are bitchy, but that is with *everyone*.  It's okay if you think I am a bitch, you are entitled to that, just as I em entitled to what I think of you, right? I just hope you understand that I was never out to get you intentionally or anything like that.    Alright well, this probably didn't ocme out the way I meant for it to either, cause everything else sounds like I am all mad, but it's not that way necessarily.

      i'm gonna say this online simply because i probably won't have time next week to say it in person and i don't particularly care to waste my time on the subject.  i wanted to have a great night friday- friday and saturday were my only escapes from work until, literally, at least next monday.  in fact, i did for the most part.  but then laura decided to get pissy again.  this is probably gonna offend some people, and i'm sorry- but this is how i feel i've been treated and what happened on friday.  i don't want to drag everyone into it, which is why i didn't say anything friday or saturday cause i wanted people to be able to enjoy themselves...  for a while now laura, you haven't been nice to me at all.  i put up with it cause i didn't care for drama.  but i seriously can't remember the last time you ever did something nice or said something nice to me... its been a long time.  everything that you say is an insult or a joke on me.  i don't know what i've done to deserve that.  i don't deserve that.  tell me if i did something wrong- but i'm pretty fucking sure i didn't.  anyway, everyone has a breaking point.  you set the tone friday when i got to kasso's.  i had just had to remove a spare tire from teh van and bring a 100 pound bench up from the garage to the van alone... so i was kinda tired and just wanted to relax watching tv.  so i wasn't really in the mood to deal with your general bitchiness to me.  people talked about getting directions to the arena and kasso went off to go get the computer working, or so i figured.  after that you said, "Well Ryan, are you gonna go get directions or what?"  It sounded really bitchy and pissed me off.  it was the continuing thing of you treating me like shit, ordering me about as if you were above me  then, at the concert, you were incredibly rude to me.  during a break i was finally getting to talk to kasso- basically the only person i could talk to during the entire thing- and you decide that you're more important and want to kick me out of my seat.  you could at least be polite and recognize that i'm stuck at the end and it would be cool to let me enjoy myself- after all i fuckin drove you.  but no, you come back from the bathroom and get all bitchy over it.  then you have to grab me and tell me to move.  i say no and then you say condesendingly, "no you don't understand" and throw me to the side.  why did you talk to me like a six year old? you made me look like an idiot in front of a bunch of people.  that was way out of line.  when i called you a bitch there, i meant it.  i havne' t sincerely called anyone a bitch in a long long time.  you deserved it.  stop treating me like i'm nothing, like i'm an underclassa nd don't deserve anything.  a friend would not have been such a bitch about the seating and at least thought about someone else's well being.  maybe i paid the same price as you for the concert nad wanted to enjoy it to? would sitting one seat over ruin it for you? probably not. you could still talk to maggie and shout over to kasso or had me say something.  shoving me off to the end of the row again was really inconsiderate.  it's extremely mean to do something like that to someone who wouldn't dream of hurting you- in a sly comment, insult, or joke.  all of those times you've said something rude/mean to me, i've kept my mouth shut.  i never insult something you do or say.  i treat you like a friend- i always say good things about you to other people.  you certainly don't treat me like a friend.  don't expect to be treated like one anymore- i've had it.  so yea- thats my diatribe online here... that laura's a fuckin bitch.  i wanted to keep silent about it, especially on friday cause i didn't want to upset anyone elses night, but that won't solve anything.  hope you guys understand that i don't like being treated like shit...

      You know how my space has been taken all of the time this year on B-days?  Not anymore!  Jones tried to have the district put a parking policy/warning sign up, but she never suceeded.  I, however, wrote an email to the head of construction at the district, making sure that I hinted at my *powerful* position on the advisory board.  Eight working days after I emailed him, he came up to me and said that he had sent me an email of what the sign could say... but I never responded (I never checked oops!) so he went ahead and ordered a sign that he liked.  Wham.  My ass got Branham a sign.  Obviously, I'm a more respected mover and shaker than Jones.  So... if ya need anything done... just pay me off :)  lol that was fun

      alright my b-day... around 2 we can take off from my place with the cakes and stuff to santa cruz.  i'm driving my mom's car, which holds four ppl plus me.  i think jessie said her car's heading over the hill too (hopefully it'll head  back  over unlike some other Fords I know of).  jason said its a go for his car to go as well.  i'd like to stay until dark (are those fire ppl still doing their thing?), but i guess some ppl want to go to the night game.  you guys can leave early but my car is gonna stay in santa cruz, so work out some rides.  other than that.... make sure you have a spare set of clothes cause i hear chocolate stains!  :)

      i agree with beth, total loss of substance on this damn blog, eeee... but it is 1/10 my fault, or however many people are on here.  anywho, just wanted to mention that the aforementioned are two different shows. what laura meant to say was:  saturday: jason webley. punk rock accordian pirate. who jessie wants to have sex in the woods with. he's that good. AND the phenomenauts. crazy space rock with men dressed in crazy duds who shoot silly string and throw toilet paper at the audience when they play. hella hella good times. there is no way you could not like this show. skankin' good time.  sunday: suburban legends. basically what laura said, seven crazy kids doing crazy flips and dances everywhere while still playing their instruments! wuh-oh. plus, the asian one is hecka cool too. yee-ah. AND moonlife. ok well, moonlife isn't a necessarily good thing, but you go for the humor of it. bad dance music with cheesy lyrics and people dressed in tight silver shiny outfits. and they shake their tushies.   .....yes, laura and i and the gang spend a lot of time at these functions, seriously. hella bomb.

      Well now, I can say something to make you all feel better about yourselves... You know that freshman I TOTALLY sexed up last night? yea, him...  Well he talks to this chick that sits at the freshman table at art so I am going to try to get in with her so that I can walk with her maybe sometime in the future and he will walk with her too so THEN MAYBE I will be in closer proximity to him than the previous 5 feet or more.  Well of course I am not all too serious about this, but it is way more entertaining than listening to Jessica eat my ear off about why she doesn't like Anne or Anne eat my ear off about condiments and dinner utensils.  Oh and to anyone who is interested: There is a show this Saturday that I believe many of you would fine quite interesting.  Jason Webley, the cool Accordian player from Seattle is coming, and he gives a very crowd involved show where you get to dance, bang empty bottles,sing along, and spin in circles! Also, the Suburban Legends are playing, and for those of you who have not seen this band, you should, because they are energetic ska, with like 7 people, who do choreographed dance moves, flip over eachother, and random acrobats on stage. MIGHTY ENTERTAINING!! For those of you who (especially) are avoiding an emo-kid show, this is definately not one of those, so let the good times roll. =)   Oh, and P.S. That wasn't meant to come off as all-knowing or anything, since I am well aware certain of you are already going and all, but I felt that the general term "show" may imply something less extraordinary and did not do specifically these 2 bands justice.

      i've come to the conclusion that this blog has died because the majority of people have online journals. I think that kind of eliminates the need for this blog. But I don't want this blog to die either, so I think we should share the wealth. I'll start.  Today was a decent day. We had to march in band, whcih always sucks major ass. English was a waste of time. We talked about teachers we hated for about 30 minutes and then we spent the rest of our time working on some ghetto ass essay. And then Ed Adams (who I swear is insane) starting drawing all over my paper and poking me with his pencil. One of these days I'm just going to open a can of whoop ass on him and I'm sure Alice will have my back. He would probably kill both of us though, because he's a freaking monster. Government was boring. Brad picked on Josh as usual and Josh stood on his soap box and preached tolerance and understanding. Those two always keep the class interesting. Maggie, Val, and I have decided to change the grad night survey and to have sex as our number one choice of activity for the cruise. Karaoke was a close second. DOWNTOWN!

      muhu! i got a new pair of shoes that wasn't even suspose to be for me!  see, my little sister wanted these low top converse that are grey and are suede so we ordered them online for her.  she told me she needed a size seven but didn't specifiy womens or mens size.  i was like, i guess that seems resonable that she;d wear my size (cause i wear a 7 in converse) because i can fit into some of her shoes, even though they are a wee bit small (i was figuring she was just getting them to grow into or soemthing) so basically they came and they are way to big for her but are my size.  and she couldn't find anything else on the converse web site that fit her fancy and it would cost like a lot to ship them back and i haven't got new shoes in a while so yeah, i'll be wearing these new zapatos on the morrow and you can ooh and awe at them.  muhu, biotch!

      ohhh, okay, thanks Beth.   If the choice comes between Jessie's house and Jessica's house, then my vote goes towards Jessie's house. There's enough space for everyone there, and most importantly, no Maurice, hehe.

      are we doing jessie's house for new year's for sure? cause she is away and i am gonna call her and let her know the final details.  personally, i wouldn't want to do it at either jessica's or jessie's, but jessie's casa is sufficient. any other suggestions anyone? we need a final consensus soon so jessie can alert her parentals.

      val- i think the plan was that we were going to jessie's house before/after the dance because her parents are going to be in LA. So yeah, i think that is what we had planned. And i'm guessing that we will be leaving early and just going and hanging out at jessie's.

      Hey, everyone, I know this is really early to ask, but...   What are we doing after Winter Ball?? Or if we're leaving early from it ((which I think we probably are)), where would we go??   I'm asking because I have to give Saiyin the specifics about everything so he can tell his parents...otherwise they're going to pick him up immediately from the dance once it's over, and I kinda don't really want that to happen...they're really protective/anal-retentive about things, and so they need details about where he'll be...I'm really sorry, but would we be able to come up with an idea?

      Billy, I think we're supposed to be going to Jessica's house, although I think some of us don't really want to go over there since her house is kinda cramped. Jessie's backyard is up as an option, and that's all I know.

      hehe - the funniest thing happened today to my little sister.  My aunt, uncle, and cousin were here from Georgia so we went with them to Santa Cruz to go to this marine laboratory that's just past Natural Bridges.  We were out on the cliff that over looks the ocean (its about 40 feet above the ocean) and my little sister is throwing and kicking rocks into the water below.  She kicks a rock and her shoe flies off her foot, landing 40 feet below in the ocean.  At first we could see the shoe but then a wave comes in and pushes the shoe even farther under the cliff and to add to that, its not possible to go down onto the beach.  Her shoe that she got about a month ago is now lost to the ocean.  Only her right foot too.  So we drove into Santa Cruz and bought her another pair of shoes.  It was hella funny.  She considered trying to climb down the cliff to get it and then the wave came.  So we bought her a pair of converse that are really cool.  They are blue high tops with light blue stitching and are light blue on the inside.  So she left for Santa Cruz with a pair of shoes and came back with three shoes.  We hassled her the rest of the time about losing her shoe. Poor poor little nikki!

      saturday works for me, as long as it is after 1. sunday also works for me, as long as it is after 5. yep.  and we really do need a good pda party! so everyone, start gathering pictures and phrases so we can all have a fat collage orgy. a full page is $250. so can maybe 10 or so people chip in and pay $25 each? or 22.72 for 11 people. 20.83 for 12 people.

      oh and, can we get the stuff together for the group pictures and also the PDA semi-soon? I know a few of us picked up info for The Picture People and the Sears photo place. I can't remember exactly, but I think Picture People is more expensive and you get 1 less pose, but you get your photos back a lot sooner or something.  Anyway, if we could get this together soon, it'd be cool, cause I am asking my parents to pay for it for Christmas, heehee. Since I have had no money since the beginning of time. riiiight.

      hey guys, my mom said "whatever the fuck you want, my carlie." on the secret santa gift exchange dinner a mi casa.  We need to figure out a day soon.  I can't do the 19th because its my dad's birthday and jason would like me to mention that he wont be here the 22-4 of december.  i guess we can do it any time during the break and we wouldn't have to od it at night, we could do it for lunch or in the afternoon too.  so whatev.  Oh, and listen to this biotches! i already got an acceptance letter from a college.  we won't mention that the college is chico, but hey! if all else fails, i can go north and hang out with Amber and Danny Johnson.  For whoever got me here's a list of nots: -no thongs -no starbucks cards -no tower cards -no movie (blockbuster, hollywood, etc.) cards -no gift cards of any kinds -no baby baths like i got last year, i want something I can actually use or whatev if you get what i mean -no obscure dolls that i'm never gonna play with  Here's a list of something that i just thought of that i want: -electrical tape in cool colors (not the scotch kind that comes in that 4 pack at like target because that     stuff blows big balls) try looking at home depot or other various hardware stores, but the one by target only has it in black, if you even want to get it for me, thoes were just a few pointers, let me add a few more commas, and make this totally like, a, run, on, sentence -a cool hat or beanie that's not hella ugly -sanrio stuff -cool soccer gloves (they are different because they have this special material on the tips of the fingers so you can do throw ins and the ball doesn't slip out of your hands) -a new soccer bag, but i'll have trouble explaining to you how i want it so i'll just stop talking now -cute underwear (size med/6) that is actually functional, let me repeat again, NO THONGS! i already have enough of thoes  now that i'm done typing, ill stop

      Laura's 2003 you-better-fucking-get-me-something-good (jk) Wishlist: 1) A scarf. Uhhh, all I can say is I Love Scarves. Warm winter ones, hair scarves, neck scarves, any scarves! 2) Cool pins/jewelery/belt/whatever. Handbags or socks or bracelets; just as long as it's cute, I'll dig it! Yea, I am super vague. 3)Just like everyone else, I too want the new Coheed and Cambria cd so I can sing along in a high pitch. CDs are going to be my demise. You all know I would love more of them... particularly...:  The Dismemberment Plan-! or Ice of Boston Modest Mouse- the fruit that ate itself Pretty Girls Make Graves- New Romance  4)If you are unoriginal or completely at a loss: Gift Certificates for cd stores, Starbucks, or Urban Outfitters would do the trick. 5) Super cool aqua eyeshadow, yo!  Sorry I wrote so much...!!

      last post...  ok so we need to get this secret santa thing kicked off asap. let me know if i am forgetting anything but here are some ground rules:  you pick names from a hat, a bucket, jason's hole-y underwear, whatever, but whoever you pick, you get and you must get a semi-decent gift for that person. if you absolutely to the max cannot have that person for whatever reason, you can put the name back in the container/receptacle and draw another name, but you can only draw once! so whoever you get the second time, you are stuck with for good. exceptions: jason can't get carlie and vice versa. you guys are probably getting each other gifts anyway, so no fair.  on the friday when break officially begins, we are gonna do the fatty gift exchange. some ideas still up for grabs:  ~dinner at a fine dining establishment? (not in 'n out, weinerschnitzel, taco bell, taco bravo, the like...) ~carlie making dinner for us/potluck. we just need someone's house for this. ~scavenger hunt! with clues!  everyone needs to put their gift in a box with the same still to be determined size, as well as the same still to be determined wrapping paper. the thing here is ambiguity! by agreeing to participate in the secret santa exchange, you are thus sworn to secrecy and cannot tell your secret santa to anyone. NO ONE. i repeat, NO ONE. if you do, you are a hoser and a loser and the rest of the degrassi clan shall shun you for life. hella no kidding.  as far as the procedure for getting gifts, here are two options:  ~you dyke. these have been your friends for hella years. you better know what the fuck to get these people.  or  ~to make it easier, and so people get things they actually want, people can make wish lists and post it here on blogger or pass them around, whichever they prefer. here, i'll start.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  maggie's hella bomb wish-list.  ~love ~jason's mom ~the live 2003 coldplay dvd/cd set IN THE DVD BOX muthafuckas.  soooooo.... yeah.  we have like two weeks. let's get a move on it, uhhhhh.....

      Yeam I think ethinc food is great; although I am more interested in thai food (FRIED BANANA) than anything also. In addition, there is this one restaurant I have never been to, but it sounds interesting... it's called Straits, and I think it is pretty expensive, but it's supposedly asian-thai-american fusion. hella crazy. But, I would give it a shot. They have a location in Santana Row, but I am not sure what the prices are. Hmm.  Jan 24 works for me...  although by that time I may have no money, heh, but we will see. Muahahah!

      word up home-people, i am on this blogger like a bitch. so i seriously like this whole "ethnic night" thing and dining out can be made fun again! two of my strongest suggestions are:  1. getting just cheesecake at the cheesecake factory one night.  2. crepes! french pride... crepe danielle in saratoga is really good. here is more info if ya'll are interested:  urlLink http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/columnists/aleta_watson/7367472.htm   other random suggestions i have are thai food, mexican (not taco bell/bravo), maybe some weird new american fusion restaurants downtown...  currently, it seems like jan. 24th is a good day for the next ethnic outing (i believe). i would say we could do it on the 19th, but people will probably want to study for finals, etc. bring up dates when you are avail/non-avail... i figure jan. 24th gives people enough time to start saving up money too! so yeah.  party on dudes. i wanna see some magic happen in this group.

      My parents are buying a Honda Accord for Marisa - they went out looking today and apparently found a really nice 94 Accord for her, and my dad knocked the price down from $4800 to $4600; he has to go make a $100 dollar deposit on it. But right now Willy is over, and he's telling my parents about this other Honda Accord that their Portugese Band director is selling - it's a 92, I think, grey, excellent condition, and is going for $3000. So now they're going to look into that one too. Which means that they're definately buying one for Marisa, and then my mom is telling my dad to just buy the other one for me since I'm going to need a car...which means I might have a car soon. I feel bad since I wanted to buy my own car so they wouldn't have to spend money, but oh well, I guess. Now I need to learn how to drive...and get a permit...and then a license.

      and here is the post winter ball scoop!   after the dance (whenever we choose to leave) we can go...um, wherever. haha, i think we should hit up a coffee shop in full attire, but maybe that's just me. anyway, when we feel like it, we can come back to my house, and have a chill fire inside or out, weather depending and all. you are all more than welcome to speand the night as well!! my parents will be home, so if anyones parents are asking, then yeah, they will be. maybe bring sleeping bags and things for that...ah, and a change of clothes, cause you probabaly don't want your dress/suit smelling like camp fire smoke. so that's the story, came as beth,c all or talk to me if ya gots any questions.  and remember: saturday night IS alright for fightin...haha

      I went to Longs to drop off some film and my dad was like, oh, can you buy me some butane lighters for an experiment I'm doing in Chemistry? So i was like sure, I hope I am old enough to buy them.  So Jason and I go, and I put the lighters down on the checkout thing and the lady (which i thought i recognized from when i went to pre-school at ATLC) was like, I'm gonna need to see some ID for you to buy these.  So I was like, how old do you have to be, and she's like 18, so I was like, Jason, you better show her yours, seeing as I'm not 18.  So that's ok, and then she's like your total is... so I go to pull the 10 dollar bill out of my back pocket and she's like, HE HAS TO PAY, so i was gonna give the ten to jason but she gave me this hard evil look so jason had to pay.  So as we were leaving I was like, Jason, i didn't know it was that hard to buy lighters and then we get in the car and jason's like, you want me to buy ciggarettes for you too now? and i was like, suck a dick, trick.  but then we went to tower and i got the new incubus cd and discovered i had 10 dollars on a tower card i thought was empty.  go me!

Zehner and I are gonna make this really blunt video that basically states how stupid people at our school are because they can't tell the difference between a recycle bin and a trash can, and how disgusting our campus is compared to other schools.  I want to go to the dump and film something there as well as at Branham, and yeah. Anyone up for making fun and lashing out at underclassmen?

      Well, since no one has said anything in a long long while I thought I'd just talk a bit about a few things. Let's see, my dad bought me a lap top yesterday.  It is suspose to be here on the 24th of June.  It's a dell and it's hella bling bling.  He even got me the bamboo green snap on! (it goes on top and gives my computer personality!).  Also, my dad is looking at getting me digital camera. Its a really cool little tiny one that is about the size of Kasso's but a little thicker and not as boxy, its more horizontal.  If you didn't read the other post, Jason and I are going to Hawaii at the end of July.  That should be quite interesting.  Me and Celeste will be gettin it on.  When I'm done with her, perhaps I'll move onto Jarrod.  Mu-hu.  Can't wait for SUSHI tonight!    Adios!  Only 2 weeks left.  BOOTCH!!!

      Yes Mandy, that would be super cool!  As you might know, I am off to Colorado tomorrow for my cousin's exciting wedding.  She will be married in Estes(?) Park.  Its a riveting 1/4 mile walk to the place of the ceremony and one has to stand during the entire ceremony.  Boy do I love this half of the family too.  To give you an idea they've lived on the east coast most of their lives and my cousins went to Duke.  They aren't really California savvy.  And now I get to meet all of their other relations. yay.  Well, I will be back sometime Monday, and we can get back to our humping.  For now, this has been Carlie, signing off.

      Hey Maggie,  Jason, Beth, and I all have Dell Inspiron 8600s.  I like my computer a lot.  I personally would never get a Mac and Berkeley is not a Mac school, so you might want to keep that in mind.  Also, our computer's screens are "wide screen" aspect ratios.  They aren't 4:3 aspect ratios like regular computer monitors are.  So depending on which you'd rather have, keep that in mind but I think they sell the same laptop with the 4:3 aspect ratio if that;s what you want. My computer is really fast, has a lot of memory, and has a very high resolution screen.  If you are going to order off the dell website my dad can probably find you a coupon, like 20% off or something.  If you need help picking one out, my dad can also help because he's researched laptops for like the last year because he got my sister one, my mom one, and then me one.  So yeah.  If you want any other info just talk to me, like lovers do...

      hiya. ok so my mom is getting me a laptop, either a mac ibook/powerbook or a dell. for all those who have dells or macs, i was wondering what types you guys had and how they work out for you because right now i am trying to compare and contrast so i can find one that suits my needs. i think right now i am hooked on to the dells, i think an inspiron 600m or 1150, maybe even fancier. so yeah. any feedback on your little comps would be hella cool. mucho thanks!

      Jessie- sadly, I was not wined and dined, although Ryan had his eye on this really cute other guy...but I understand Jason wined and dined you...I hope he was up to your qualifications...hehe  While attending orientation I got the joy of eating interesting DC food (there's nothing like weird egg rolls and cold chicken on a stick), being the only one in my suite (other than the girl with me) who got stuck in a double, being forced to dance very late at night to weird poka music designed to make you meet as many people as possible (I probably danced with 40 guys), getting stuck in a predominately male and almost completely Asian orientation group (there was one other white guy and only 3 other girls), being forced to discuss "serious" issues with people you've never met before, stuck for 3 straight hours and 6 hours a day in Warren lecture Hall 2001 (those chairs were soooooo hard!), among many many other exciting things.  I can't wait for college.  I hope your guyes orientations are as interesting as mine was!

      Well, guys, I'm off to beautiful san diego!  I leave tomorrow morning at 8:30 and come back friday night.  I'll miss you all.  Don't do anything too exciting without me!  I updated my photobucket a few days ago.  I haven't uploaded the graduation pics because there's a lot of them and photobucket is being a bitch.  I'm gonna take a lot of pics while I'm away so some certain people can see what they're missing by not going to UCSD! ::cough::bearssuck::cough::

      Hey. So this is the game plan for Monday ---  We're going to have our own little shindig right in the middle of the quad. Thus decided by Jessie and myself. We're thinking beach towels, chairs, tables, food, and 4 mats of Twister put together for one massive orgy Twister. And a boom box with better music than what leadership picks out. Hella. Soooooo, if you can, bring food and whatnot on Monday for lunch. I'll try to bring some dessert food or something.   And I know we're all mentioned this between ourselves, but we really need to get everyone together so that we can all sign each other's yearbooks at someone's house for long periods of time. If anyone can volunteer their house or whatever, that'd be awesome. Or we could go to a park to do it, and have like a pinic or something. Either Monday after school or one of the other days after that would be good for signing, I think.   Last thing -- we still need to exchange Senior Portraits, people, so maybe when we sign each other's yearbooks, we can swap pics as well.   Rawr. My face is peeling. Goddamn sunburns.

       well, i mean that we should give group-wide "going away" presents altho not everyone is "going away" but most of us will be apart, so we need something that is identical and we can all have like a picture frame we all decorate with a pic of all of us or address books (that we again decorate together) that has all of our "new" addresses in it    &nbsp;  we should probably also, once the school year begins, send out care packages, maybe secret santa style so everyone gives and everyone gets something in return (which would probably be more organized) or just random people (from our group) send other people from our group whatever they want to send, which will probably happen anyways, altho the secret santa-style ensures everyone gets something in the mail

       So, this is more of a statement for people who haven't been around and stuff, and I direct it as KASSO, seeing as how it would be of importance to her.    &nbsp;  Anyway, we realized that Saturday evening is basically the last day most people are around. (minus Bryan)    &nbsp;  SO we need to something big & good, for use of the simplest kindergarten-vocabulary.    &nbsp;  Kasso-- would it be a good night to do your party/shindig/hooplah thing? I know it is kinda short notice- that's why I/we are asking, heh.    &nbsp;   &nbsp;  What do you guys think? Can you be available Saturday night? Even if we don't do something at her house, we have to do SOMETHING !

      Ok &nbsp;So since i love Sonic so much, i was thinking it could be possible to go up with the avery group for a little while and eat there and come back down as the others make their way up. Besides, the road there is very easy to drive and it's only an hour long (not even worse then goign to Santa Cruz through Highway 9) ANyways, if anyone is up to it contact me, i think Salcido and Paul might already go but then again it's no guarantee. If of course that is alright Avery groupies. Sicne i've gone to sonic with paul and laura&nbsp;&nbsp;before (on top of it) it will be pretty awesome. (Mandy too!!! that was freaking cool!!!) SHe knows SHE REMMEBERS!

(like croissants or pop tarts, etc.)   we'll probably go food shopping on sunday night maybe after or before the container store's college night thingy

      I'm not sure if I'd be able to make the birthday bash/going-away party shindig...I'd probably be having my birthday celebration with all my relatives on that day, since the 9th and 10th will be hectic due to the rushing of getting everything packed away and ready. But if everyone can make that, then you should totally do it, it's a fun idea.

      Hey guys, I know its a little early but I was thinking for my birthday (which I was going to celebrate before my actual birthday so everyone who is going off to college and stuff can attend) that I could invite everyone and their parents and families and have a huge afternoon barbecue thingy at the beach on a weekend.&nbsp; I was thinking Sunday, the 8th of august. Before that I am on vacation, the 7th is val's b-day, and we were planning to be in longbeach that next weekend so yeah.&nbsp; if there are too many conflicts I guess its a nevermind on that idea.&nbsp; or it could be done during the week but then parents would have trouble coming because of work and what not and I wanted this to be like a going away party thingy where all the parents and all the kids could hang and be merry.&nbsp; so give me a holla and tell me what you think!

      hello love-mongrels!!  &nbsp;  Well, as you know, I can't really go on any nice trips with you all (sad face)  buuuut... while we have free days on weekends and such, we need to start thinking about the stuff we want to do, cuase I know ideas have been brought up, but we better get thinking about it before everyone is gone!!  &nbsp;  So here are some of the ideas people have been talking about doing and some random new ones that may nto be well-liked but im trying to think of everything i can:  &nbsp;  -SF Zoo  -Art Museums  -Shopping days (Haight, gilroy outlets, wherever)  -Sonic + neighbooring shops (okay i know you who are going on the trip will prolly do this, but I know for sure Laura and I were going to go back, so if anyone wants to come with us, that'd be even cooler!!)  -That lake on Hicks everyone jumps off of  -A night we dress up all fancy and go out to dinner  -Figure out how to make an actual good-looking un-lame pomp.

      how'd you get 3.8 as the average? with just the ones you passed, 4, 4, 3 is a 3.666 average. if you go for a total average, it's a 3. No wonder you didn't pass the calc  therefore, all your base are belong to jason

      like ok.  calculus: BIG FAT FAIL. chemistry: BIGGER FAT FAIL. actually, I am way more schway than Mr. Garnel shall ever be, so I get 500+ Schway points, which will count as Bear Bucks at Berkeley. Yay me.  econ: 3 gov: 4 Wally can kiss my waddling Asian toushy.  english: 4. Fuck your couch, Clinton.  Therefore, I have an average score of 3.8, which when rounded up becomes a 4, which is overall not too shabby. And I, Maggie to the Maggadactyl Liu, have a coin slot. Which makes me better than all of you. All your base are belong to Maggie. Which is me.   [[or is it...dun dun dun...]]

      Hey, soooooo, the hypothetical plan for tonight -- Drive-ins at 9pm to see Anchorman, since it opens today [[that's the new Will Ferrell movie]]. And...that's about all the planning I've done so far. We'll need to get there early since it's Friday night, blah blah blah, and yeah.

      a-ha! attack of the in-n-out secret menu! i am excited to try one of these, to be "in the know", mwa ha ha...  Animal Style - Your burger is cooked with mustard and instead of raw onions they are sauted. Extra pickles and extra "special sauce" complete the order.  Animal Style Fries - Fries with cheese, sauce, and grilled onions.  Choco-Vanilla Swirl Shake - You get the idea.  Double Meat - A Double Double without the cheese.   Flying Dutchman - Two beef patties cooked medium rare. Add two slices of cheese and thats it. Not even a bun!  Fries well done - Extra, extra crispy fries.  Grilled Cheese - No meat, just melted cheese, tomato, lettuce, and sauce on a bun.  Home Run - When a car passes by the microphone without ordering and stops at the service window.   Neapolitan Shake - A custom blend of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry shakes.   On the Sal - Lettuce and dressing. Yes, thats really it.  Protein Style - Lettuce is wrapped around the burger instead of a bun.  Wish Burger or Veggie Burger - No meat, no cheese. Just a bun, lettuce, tomato, and special sauce.  2 by 4 - Two beef patties with four slices of cheese.  3 by 3 - Three beef patties with three slices of cheese.  4 by 4 - Four beef patties with four slices of cheese. 4 by 6 - Four beef patties with six slices of cheese.  (Actually you can get a burger with as many meat patties or cheese slices as you want. If you want 4 pieces of meat and 8 pieces of cheese tell them you want a 4-by-8.)  3 by Meat - Three meat patties and no cheese.
