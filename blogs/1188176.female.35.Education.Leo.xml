      Rick teased me this morning that he wasn't sure I stayed up late last night because I did not blog. I did stay up (1:30 am) but I was working on things that need to be done for the major event that we will be doing at church in 2 1/2 weeks. On July 17, the women in our church will be hosting the 2nd annual Fashion Share at our church.   The concept is that we invite women who are in "hard times" usually from shelters to have a luncheon and fashion show at our church. After the lunch, we have the fashion show. It is with women from our church so we all hoop and holler for the ladies. After the show, there is a time of shopping for these women. All the ladies of the church have donated nice clothing for these women. It may sound like a project that could be condescending, but you have to know our church. We are not a large church, we are not affluent, and this event requires lots of hard work from all of the women in our church. I will handle lighting and music for the fashion show. I will also raid the drama closet at school for racks for the clothes and for decorations for the church.   Last night, I was making corsages. I have a total of 50 to make. I have made bows and cut artificial roses for about 28 of them. Rick awoke to bows laying all over the dresser in our bedroom. My goal is to have them and the 50 bows for gift baskets done by this Sunday. I still need to find music for the fashion show. I cannot find the CD we used last year.. drat. That would have made my work much easier. Lighting won't get done until the week of the show. I can't move the lights until after the Sunday service.  Those of you who read this... Please pray for us to find a caterer. The one we thought was going to donate his services has backed out on us. Last year the caterer donated everything. Right now, our best option will cost 550.00. We do not have that kind of money. We are praying for something to happen to allow us to do this for free. Any caterers from South Carolina our there? God leading you to work with us on this?

      Once again, it is late and I am awake. It is raining, Rick is sleeping, and I am sure that Grace the hound dog is a little nervous. But, I had this idea after I finally laid down last night... Since Rick is making a stand ( urlLink see his blog for this ), I thought I would use this time "early" in my blogging career to write about how God has brought to where I am today. I guess it is my testimony (long form) and I hope it is not too convoluted.  I am the only child of 2 people who still today fail to see the God that is in front of their faces. Ironically, my parents met at a church dance. While my parents did not believe that church was something important, they did believe that education was and sent me to a private fundamentalist grade school and I learned an amazing amount of knowledge- both about God and the reading, writing, arithmetic basics.  My parents switched me to a public middle school and I had to transition to a situation that I was not prepared for. Primarily, the situation was a problem because I knew virtually no one at my new school, just a few people from the neighborhood. This means I had missed all of those developing friendships from elementary school. Also, I dealt with the fact that I had never been to school with anyone from a different race than me. I know that sounds odd, but coming from a Southern private school, it was not all that unusual.  Middle school and high school were tumultuous because of my parents' relationship and my father's alcoholism that was getting worse everyday. Life became hard to deal with and I decided that either there was no God or he did not care for me. I became very self reliant but somewhat of an oddball because I would not get involved with the groups who drank in high school. Too many of them were the ones talking about God on Monday and partying on Friday. But God is in control and even at this time in my life He gave me 3 friends-each who loved Him in a powerful way and each who loved me in spite of my dislike of church, God and such. These three friends were my first step back to a God I had met as a young child.  My parents' divorced after my sophomore year of high school. My dad went his way, not ready to stop drinking, and my mom and I learned through al-anon and Alateen that the drinking was not our fault. I also learned that there was a "higher power" in my life, but I did not yet know that this was Jesus Christ. This was a second step in a journey that would truly take a new route in my college years. God was with me the entire time but later He would truly introduce Himself to me. God is good all the time, we just do not know it.

      God does tie it all together. Last night I was talking to Lacey on the phone. Lacey is a former student with whom I talk a lot. She and I have become close over the years, discussing God, career choices, and of course-- her dating life. She was telling me about painting the children's area at her church with some of her friends. One of the guys was someone she used to work with and they were discussing how he took over FCA at the high school he teaches at here in town. He was asking for help from Lacey since she used to the FCA captain at the school where I teach. Lacey started to laugh and tell Jacob how much he and his wife had changed from the time the two of them worked together at the fitness center. He has come to know Jesus and he and his wife are really living for God. Jacob and Lacey had discussed God and having a relationship with Him many times, but he just wasn't ready to let go of his life yet. I remember her telling me about it. Though it took a while, Jacob has come to know Jesus. God is awesome. Now the rest of the story.  In my second year of teaching, I was teaching sophomore English to a bunch of kids who were obnoxious brats, but there was one in particular. He was a big football player who constantly used his size and family name to intimidate his teacher(me). He and I often argued over his classroom behavior, and he was the first person to ever walk out of my class. What an arrogant snot!!!!  Yes, that arrogant snot was Jacob. God allowed me to endure this child (not one of my favorites)and God allowed to grow into a friendship with Lacey so that eight years later, I could rejoice as we had a conversation about what a Godly man, teacher, and coach Jacob has become.   Thank you Lord for allowing me to witness the seeds that were planted in Jacob by discussions with Lacey and allowing all of us to see the fruit that has come from all of this.  Yes, God does tie it all together.

      I hate it when I wake up at 1:45 in the morning and can't go back to sleep. I have been surfing the net for the last 30 minutes and think I may lay down on the couch and try to sleep. Hopefully it will just rain and not storm anymore tonight.   Grace, my sweet hound dog, is scared of thunder and is actually sleeping in our bedroom tonight. That is very unusual. Grace was one of those dogs that was rescued by Pets Inc. and Santa brought her to live at our house. Originally she was a gift for Trace and Cammi (a coonhound was the only dog at the place that 3 year old Cammi was not afraid of), but since I am the one who feeds her, walks her, and pets her, she has become my dog.   We have a third floor in our house. It used to be an attic, but we converted it into a storage room and "spare" bedroom (Read that as another larger storage room with a bed and old couch/futon) and Grace has taken over that area of our house except when there is thunder. Then she is my magnet dog. She is good sweet dog. Now the cat, that is a story for another night.

      Today, I had Trace and Adrian sitting with me during church. Adrian's mom (my friend Dawn) had nursery duty so he asked if he could sit with us. I said sure. Within a few minutes, I realized that the boys had been to my car and had brought "contraband" into service. After I claimed a book and a couple of toys, things were ok. It isn't that what they had brought in was bad, it was just that Trace had been told No about these things coming into church today and he had disobeyed. So there I sat with my son and the Pastor's son (a pair of nine year olds)trying to focus on the message...  The message focused on Daniel 5. I wrote my notes on a sheet of paper that I took from the notebook that the boys were using to write their comic (Super Joseph) and began listening to pastor Mike talk about Daniel interpreting a dream for Belshazzar when he sees the hand writing is on the wall and no one but Daniel can explain it. Daniel interprets that basically the writing says, "God has counted the cost and found you wanting/lacking and will give your kingdom to others." He then proceeded to use different scriptures to discuss how God wants us to be not only faithful but also fruitful (focused on John 15- vine and branches).   Everything he said this morning slammed me in the face. I do not feel that I do have a fruitful life and that I need to be so much more than I am. I wasn't sure if God had really spoken to me during the service until Trace leaned over and we had the following conversation.   Trace   "Mom, should we go down?" (This from a kid who drew cartoons in church)  me  "Why, do you think God has spoken?" (I like to know Trace's thoughts)  Trace   "I don't know, but.." (Sometimes he isn't articulate, he is almost nine)  me  "Well we can go pray if you think we ought to" (he thought we ought to)  We went down and prayed. God is awesome and speaks through my children many times... Usually right before I have to shoo 5-6 kids out of my car after service. What is the fascination with my vehicle?  Tonight, I feel a bit more contemplative.... Lord, increase my prayer life, increase my knowledge of You, increase my courage and let me be the woman You want me to be... Because so much of the time, I feel like I am a failure. Amen.

      I was reading on the Beth Moore website earlier and came across this term "Life Verse". I had never heard of it, but is apparently a term for a new concept that is vogue in church these days (no disrespect meant to anyone out there). I am usually behind the times when it come to new terms,ideas and issues in the church. If it isn't big in preschool choir, I am not aware of it.   I was intrigued with the idea and did a google search on the owrd and found out a little more about it. Lots of people out there have them and lots of people are "poking fun" at them...  I have never really thought about what my life verse would be (since I had never heard of the word prior to a few hours ago) but as I sat and was reading during my quiet time this morning.. I was drawn back to Philipians 4:13.  "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me." This verse has been the one that I have focused on at many of the bad or hard times in my life-- when my parents divorced, when the "love of my life" broke up with me in college, when I stepped on a plane to be a missionary to Japan, when my mom had cancer, and so on...  There have been many other important verses in my life, and I think I would have to say that this is one of my favorites.

      I just checked my school email and had a note from the school book keeper. She isn't one of those people who really puts subjects for her emails but uses the first sentence as her subject. This is what it read... ( VICKI, MR. JOVANELLY PUT 1000.00 IN YOUR DRAMA ACCOUNT )"Holy Cow" was my response and I made Rick count the number of zeroes in the email to make sure I was getting one thousand dollars instead of one hundred. This coming school year will be the second year with this principal and I had to explain to him last year that in the nine years I had been teaching drama at Airport High School that I have rarely gotten any money for a budget and that I usually raise my own funding for class and school wide productions. He found that incredulous. Now I am incredulous... and I am doing cartwheels over 1,000.00 as a budget. I am way excited. I need to do a little shopping right now. What does that new drama room I got really need??? This is going to be cool.

       urlLink     Well, we are back from our whirlwind vacation to the mountains. I hate that Rick could not go with us, but we still had fun. The kids are at a magical age where they can get in the car themselves, fasten their own seatbelts, carry their own suitcases, help with packing, and spend 4 hours in the lake playing while I sit contentedly by reading a book in a very comfortable adirondack chair. I actually finished 2 books while we were gone. The weather was good. We had rain showers each afternoon, but it usually cleared up in a few hours and actually allowed me to get the kids back to the house for some lunch. I am glad I had snacks at the lake or I would not have been able to last as long as the kids did. The kids and I took lots of photos. Cammi especially has become the photographer and Trace is becoming the mini golf player. I think it is time for Rick to teach him real golf so they can go play golf while Cammi and I hang out at the lake. As much fun as the trip was though, I am glad to be home. I missed Rick. He and I have been married for 13 years and I still get sad when one of us has to be out of town even over night. I just like being with him. We are all back together now. The three of them just finished playing Concentration and the kids are heading to bed soon. I am tired too. Tomorrow we will tackle the cleaning of the car.

      Well, once again, it is very late and I can't sleep. This is becoming a habit that I do not like so far. Anyway, I have been surfing through some blogs and found some interesting sites. My favorite so far is  urlLink Japan Window . I got to it through  urlLink Deb's site (thanks!).It is from Tokyo and reminds me so much of the time I lived in Nagasaki. I can't believe that is has been 15 years since I was there. I feel very old. I love the Japanese culture and thoroughly love reading the blogs and especially looking at the photos. Now, I just need to figure out how to link it to my page. Rick has been helping me get started with this venture. I goofed up several things associated with Rick's blog when I first started mine.. But that's what happens when I am up at night instead of sleeping.. At least I wasn't shopping at EBAY!

      I am a teacher with 2 small children who has been out of school for about a month which means several things....  1. The kids are driving me and each other crazy. I have heard "I'm bored" way too many times. They are also starting the summer ritual of constant bickering. i know this is normal, but it is beginning to get on my nerves.  2. I'm a little bored. I am tired of the house and the weekly trips to the library.  All of that to say, we are going on a trip tomorrow. Mom has a place in the mountains of NC at  urlLink Lake Lure , so we three adventurers are going off to play for a few days. Unfortunately, Rick has work and cannot join us, but it will give him a little quiet time, and hopefully the kids will tire out early in the mountains and I can have some quiet reading time too. Wish me luck.. I hate packing for trips and trying to make sure everything is settled before I leave.  Hope I remember a book.... will post again after we return.

      This year, we decided to celebrate father's day at our house on Saturday instead of Sunday. Every year, Sunday is full of worship, family dinners, and stuff and Rick never gets a chance to enjoy whatever presents we have for him. I have been musing tonight about how my life has been shaped by my own father.    Politics - I grew up with my father always voting a straight republican ticket. He did not (and still doesn't) think that there could be a good democrat. While, I tend to be a conservative voter, I am an independent voter who looks at each candidate, instead of sticking to party lines.  Gun Control - well, we just disagree about everything on that front. I will never have weapons in my home, and he doesn't understand that concept.  God - Dad doesn't really care about a relationship with God, but it isn't where you can discuss it with him, because he is already knows all he needs to know.. I just want to know more, because I know that I have only scratched the surface with what God wants to do in my life.  I will talk to my dad tomorrow. I will tell him "happy father's Day" and that I love him, but the relationship will not be there. It hasn't been there for many years, but it isn't really sad, more empty. I keep praying for Him to be with him..   One of the reasons that I have not been blogging before, is that I always seem to have interesting starts to ideas, but no finish... Always had that problem with essays in college too. I started out musing about my dad, and now I find myself musing about God and my relationship with Him and I do not know exactly how I want to end this writing. Well, maybe I will be able to keep to one coherent thought as I rite more.   Good Night and Happy Father's Day to all those dads out there. May your relationships be full and not empty.

      I couldn't go back to sleep after I got up at 4:00 am this morning. Finally, at 6:45, I decided to go walk the dog. As Grace and I began our daily adventure (normally we go out at night, but it was too late when everyone left our house last night), I noticed that our next door neighbors were having a yard sale. If I had known that at 4:00 am, I would have stuck some stuff out in our driveway. I ended up buying a set of wicker furniture before 7:00 am and spent the morning trying to rearrange the play/sun room to make it fit and make some of the children's junk disappeared. I have wanted to put wicker out there for some time, but couldn't really afford the prices for new furniture out there ($500.00). Now I have a whole set for a very reasonable price ($50.00) and can spend some time over the next few months getting it and the playroom into the shape I would like for it to be in.  Today has been good so far. Rick slept in (happy father's day to the minister who won't sleep in tomorrow) and the kids and I have already gotten presents for all the guys. We just need to sign cards and wrap stuff... I think we will have Rick's special time tonight after dinner. That is much better than trying to give him stuff in the morning before church. All in all, a good day... so far.

      I have thought about blogging for some time now. Since I am up and it is 5:00 am on a Saturday, I thought I might go ahead and start. Rick (my husband) will be impressed (by the blogging, not by the fact I have been up since 4:00 am and can't go back to sleep). I would like to use this blog to write about myself and the things going on in my life. Usually, that will involve high school drama students since that is my vocation and my calling.. Sounds weird to be called to work with high school drama students, but the more I am around them, the more I realize it has to be a calling and not just the vocation I ended up in...   About me... I love Jesus, my husband and my children. I love being a teacher and most of the time, I love this juorney we are on together. I want to write about the loved of my life and hope that those of you who choose to read me will understand a little about my pursuit of these different loves.

      School has not started yet, but.... I have already started trying to work in my room to get it in order. All of my stuff has been taken out of my old room and I have put stuff in my new room. I am a little sad. I taught in room 209 for 8 years.  It was like moving out of my house by changing rooms. Actually it was like moving out of a house and into an apartment. I have had to purge a lot of files and junk I have accumulated over the years. I still have stuff in the drama storage room that needs to be cleaned out, but that will have to wait until after I get things started with the school year.  Next week will be dedicated to writing my lesson plans, calendars, and syllabus. After school starts, I will spend a little time each day in the storage room, cleaning and throwing things away. I will take a photo of my new room next week. I should have taken a picture of it empty, but I forgot. Well, good night all. I need to start looking at my lesson plans for next week. School hasn't started yet, but it has for me.

      I am not a political person. I consider voting an important priviledge and duty, but I have always considered it to be a personal issue. I think it is because my dad has always been a gungho Republican who votes a straight ticket in every race because he believes that no Democrat could ever be a good candidate. That always bothered me. It is my opinion that there is no way that only one party can have the right candidates in EVERY race in every year; therefore, I tend to be an independent voter. I vote for the candidate, not the party.   I am in a conundrum about the presidential race this year, and I am concerned over the posturing that the Republicans are doing to the Christian conservatives. Am I a bad Christian if I dislike what I am seeing?   Rick has had big debates with assorted people about his views. I respect his views although he and I disagree on some of his thoughts :, but I do not feel pressure from him to believe a certain way. I do feel it from the media, the church, family, and others in the community. It does not help that I am a theater teacher and therefore must be liberal (actually I am very conservative- a fact that throws some of the "unique" teens I teach). It just seems like everyone expects me to have certain views and I do not think I have them.   I don't mind that I don't know my opinions yet. I will just sit back and listen to them all and make some decisions between now and November. Don't mind me, I am just voicing thoughts.

      My mom is home from the hospital. Yippee!! Her stay was much shorter this time, even with it being lengthened by an infection (hip replacement surgery). She is feeling well although she is a little tired still. The kids and I went out to dinner with her this evening. I really enjoyed doing that. I am glad that so much has worked together for her this time. Thank you for all of the prayers.

      Rick reminded me that I do not officially go back to work until next week, but I am sad that my summer is over and that it is time for school to start back. I has been a good summer and we had so much fun on vacation. We went to  urlLink Stone Mountain  Georgia for vacation. It is just outside Atlanta. We stayed at the inn inside the park and were able to walk to everything and it was wonderful. We played and swam and watched the laser light show every night. As we came back in town this afternoon, we stopped at the elementary school to see the class lists. Trace and Cammi were excited to get the teachers they wanted, but Cammi cried when her best friend got a different teacher for first grade. I cannot believe my babies are so big now. Trace is going in third grade, stands above my shoulder, and wears the same size socks as me. Cammi Beth pretends to talk on her cell phone and kept wanting to go shopping with me while we were on vacation. What happened to those kids I read Dr. Seuss to?  Well, time to unpack the car (It was pouring rain when we got home). Tomorrow will be "find the dining room" day as I unpack, sort laundry, and send assorted toys to each child's room. As much as I hate that school is only a few days away, it is good to be home, even with the laundry :)

      Today has been busy discussing theories of assessment with other educators and writing lessons using said assessments. Rick and I had a short debate on whether God would grade with a checklist (either you get it or you don't) or a rubric (You basically get partial credit). All I know is that most days AI would fail whichever way he graded.. By the way, I think God grades with grace, which is much better than checklists or rubrics.  Now it is 10:25 and I have a lot to do before bed. I am blogging and making my things to do list. Thanks for understanding.   1. Pack lunches for kids to have tomorrow at camp.   2. Pack swimsuits and towels for camp.   3. Plug in Trace's gameboy to charge overnight.   4. Put dishes away.   5. Put laundry away.   6. Bring another load of laundry down to do.    7. Make sure all pets have food and water.   8. Pick up assorted toys, clothes, shoes, etc. from all parts of the house and return these items to their correct locations.   9. Lay out sheets for all beds to get changed tomorrow.    10. Remember to put my homework in my bag for tomorrow.    11. Thank Rick for doing so much so I can do this class this week.    12. Thank God for not grading me the way my professors are grading my projects for this class.   13. Get to bed before 11:30 pm. (no problems waking up in the middle of the night this week).  Good night all....

      This post will be written quickly because I have HOMEWORK to do.. Yeah, I know.&nbsp; But taking a class for a week and getting graduate credit and it being completely FREE is the reason I do it.. Now could someone explain authentic assessment, validity of standards and rubrics vs. Checklists theories? Me neither. Guess homework will take awhile.  &nbsp;  Before my class started this afternoon, I went to school to move the last few things to my new classroom. I realized I needed a few extra containers, so I ran down to the Dollar General store. The cashier was one of my former students home for summer.&nbsp;T (a college scholarship basketball player)&nbsp;told me that he decided to take an acting class to help his GPA this last semester. After doing the first day's assignment, the professor asked if he had previous experience in theater. T told her that he had four years of high school theater. She told he was a natural and should consider theater as a major (This university has a great theater program). Long story short- T is now a theater major and is very excited. His professor also told him I must have been a good teacher. T is being excited about pursuing this and doing well- B average in college. (Yeah, I checked to make sure he wasn't in trouble with his scholarship). It was a cool experience. I was a proud Drama Mama this morning .  &nbsp;  Now.. gotta run.. HOMEWORK IS WAITING.

      Today, Dawn and I had extended session with the 3-6 year olds. OH MY!! This is the quickest growing segment of our small church and we had 14 children today (and 3 of our regulars were not there). It is not often that I say that Cammi is a mature child, but comparatively, today she was. 3 little bossy 3 year old girls kept getting into arguments over what belonged to whom. The resident tattler kept telling us when the girls were arguing, and about 5 minutes after taking them outside, they were hot and bored. (Today was a relatively cool for a July Sunday in South Carolina). I was thankful that our service was fairly short (for our church). Normally I like the kids, but with this many at the varying ages we have, 14 was tough. Maybe I was just tired from yesterday's Fashion Share.  Several of us &nbsp;women of the church sat around this morning laughing about all of the "problems" from yesterday. My favorite was about Scott and Carlos. As Dawn was praying before we started serving lunch, I could hear them talking (I was in the sound booth and the back of the sanctuary and they were right in front of me but a wall was blocking my view of them). I was annoyed that they were talking during prayer because that is rude. What I didn't know until this morning was that they were trying to remove the burning pan from the church's carpet before it left a larger burn mark on the floor. Carlos' dad is the minister of music at church and generally the keeper of the building. Carlos' line to Scott was "oh no... My dad is going to kill you and me!"  I laughed so hard when&nbsp;I found out what was really going on. Only at our church :)

      My friend, Dawn, got really sad news this afternoon. Dawn grew up in Mississippi. Her best friend was Stacy. About the same time as Dawn's husband Mike was diagnosed with cancer last year, Stacy's mom was too. Mike pulled through his fight with cancer in a miraculous way, but today Stacy's mom lost her battle. It hit Dawn especially hard. I guess part of it had to do with Mike surviving and Stacy's mom not, but I do not think that anyone of us is ever ready to lose a parent.  I ask for prayer for Stacy and her family through this time. They know Christ but the pain is still there. I also ask for prayer that Dawn's schedule will work in such a way that she can go home to Mississippi for the funeral. I know it would mean a lot to both Dawn and Stacy.

      I thought I would relay my day at Fashion Share this way.  I learned a lot today, but mainly that God is good all the time. I also learned that...  &nbsp;  * "Be at the church at 8:00 am" doesn't mean the same thing to everyone.  * "We just have a few things to finish" is usually an understatement.  * Call if you are going to be 2 hours late. (not me.. I was only my usual 5 minutes late) * I can use the Xerox machine in record time when last minute changes are made.  * I can set lighting and sound fairly quickly even when people are late or are trying to tell me how to do it "right"(got a little annoyed at that one).  * When sterno cans are too hot and you have to put the burning&nbsp;serving dish&nbsp;on the floor, there will be a mark on the carpet.  * Chicken Alfredo can be kept in ice chests to stay warm. (OXYMORON??)  * Chocolate cake always tastes good.  * Teenage boys get nervous about being waiters and carrying food.  * Teenage boys do think about more than one thing Ruby... But it is usually related to food.  * Teenage boys&nbsp;will trip over big purses, but God will keep entire lighting systems from falling over on dinner tables.  * Powerful Godly&nbsp;women can&nbsp;be used&nbsp;anytime and anywhere.  * Shopping is fun whether the dresses are new or not.  * Prayer time is always awesome... But especially when God is moving in women.  * Fashion shows are much more fun at church because you can hoop and holler for your friends.  * Women who would never model at any other time look fabulous at Fashion Share.  * Car keys are always in the last place you look for them.  * Major church events work better with many people actually working.  * Teenage boys will clean up the church for pizza :) (Think they'd do my yard for pizza too??) * Serving the Lord by serving others is cool whether they appreciate it or not.  * I am really tired and will be taking a long hot bath as soon as the thunder storm passes.  * Everything does come together when we love God and seek to serve only Him.  * God is good all the time and we can never forget that.  &nbsp;  AMEN!!  &nbsp;

      I have decided that unless you are an only child, you cannot truly appreciate the junk involved when your parent is sick and there is nothing you can do to improve it.... Mom decided yesterday that she needed to get off of the painkillers. This was her decision not the doctor's and it was based simply on her concern that she might get hooked on painkillers. Nevermind the fact that she is only a week out of surgery and actually doing real physical therapy this time. The she had another lady put in her room with her today. That was awful for my mom. Mom is very claustrophobic and the nurses immediately were pulling curtains and closing doors for privacy.  Arggh... Nothing&nbsp;I can do for her.   Fashion Share is tomorrow. I have to be at church at 8:00 am. Please pray that all goes well. I am in good shape for what i need to do. I just pray for smoothness of all that is going together.   My positive news for today is that I finally got a haircut. That was awesome :)    urlLink Jen , thanks for the entry for me. It was and is a blessing. I really appreciated it. Good night all.

      Good morning all. I had a great night of sleep last night, which is such a blessing after the last several nights. i have good news on&nbsp;a couple of&nbsp;fronts, so here goes...   1. MY MOM- she is doing great. At least I consider it great. She is finally at the rehab hospital and doing well. She is getting out of bed by herself and walking almost as well as before the surgery. She says usually the pain is not much worse than before the surgery and she is just today a week out of her surgery. Her physical therapy is going well, and watching the struggles of others is making mom more appreciative of where she is and what she can do. She also told me thank you for being here and helping her so much. She has seen people with no family and has become more thankful for us too.. Now I will be praying for a breakthrough with her spiritual life.   2. FASHION SHARE- This Saturday is fashion share. As of Tuesday night, we only have 30 women coming from various shelters, but we are excited about how the Lord will be working with these ladies. I finally got to go shopping last night. I found several outfits at very low prices last night. I was excited.&nbsp; Keep it in your prayers.

      I didn't go to sleep until after 12:00 and I woke up at 1:45 am. I do not feel well so I am sitting at the computer surfing the net. I am mentally and physically exhausted but can't sleep since I do not feel well. I can't take any "p.m." Medication anymore because it has the opposite effect on me keeping me awake instead of allowing me to sleep.  I feel pretty overwhelmed with the world right now. This is the week before Fashion Share so we all worked from 6:00-9:30 tonight making baskets, sorting dresses, etc. My mom is still in the hospital, I have a major graduate theater class next week (Authentic Assessment in the Arts), we leave on vacation the day after my class, we come home just a few days before school starts, my new classroom has nothing in it yet, and I am also finding my mind full of other stuff too.   I am not understanding where I am with God right now. He has me at a point where I am trying to hear His voice, but I don't and I am not really feeling His presence right now. It is not a place I like being. I know He is with me. I have watched the healing in my mom begin (physically not spiritually yet) but there are some other areas in my life that just do not make sense.. (kind of like my blog right now)  I am terrified of this coming school year. I am pursuing my  urlLink National Board Certification  in Theater and the work load for this program has me freaked out. I have to complete a portfolio that is HUGE (a few hundred pages) and take an essay style test that lasts for something like 4-6 hours. If I pass, I will be certified to teach theater anywhere in the U.S. and my state and district will pay me an extra stipend each year. It's worth it if I pass, and I am apparently the only person out here who has any fear of failure. I wish I had confidence in me the way that others do.  Well it is VERY late. i think if I am going to stay up any longer, I need to pull out some of my National Board reading... Nothing like educational philosophy and standards to put you to sleep. Good night all.

      I read  urlLink Ruby's  List of things that Lizzie learned at camp and decided to compile my list of things I have learned today. I am not sure they are as profound as Lizzie's list... But who knows?  * I hate my hair and want a haircut * No hair salons are open when you decide the hair needs to be cut right now! * I am not as forceful as I would like to be * Insurance companies make me think of words that my mom would wash my mouth out with soap for using (well today she would not have) * Hound dogs are afraid of thunder * God is good even when it doesn't make seem like He is making any sense * The amount of rain coming down is directly proportional to the distance your car is from the front of the hospital * Hot dogs with slaw are only fun if shared with Rick * It must be near the end of summer since Cammi and Trace are getting on each other's nerves and mine too * My mom's physical therapy goes better when she is mad at her insurance company for not yet approving her move to rehab * Good friends check on each other often * Home and garden shows never reflect my house * The house is really quiet at 10:00 pm when you are the only person awake * Rain sounds really nice when falling on the metal roof of our sunroom * Daily TIme with God is always important but especially when you feel stress * Blog entries should be finished before the chocolate cake in the kitchen is eaten...  Good Night!

      What a difference 2 years makes.... On this day 2 years ago, my mom took a turn for the worse.. Her fever shot up, she had to have a blood transfusion and the horrible results of her surgery (loss of urinary and bowel functions and nerve damage to her legs) began. But today, was a much better day. Thank you Lord!  I admit that when my mom told me this morning that she had had a bad night that I got a little nervous. I took the children to church, found Rick and explained my concern, and left for the hospital. The major reason she had a bad night is that the real pain from the surgery had finally settled in and her pain medication was not helping. When my mom needs more pain medication (she doesn't want to take any) then the pain is REALLY bad. Also, Mom had some mild itching reactions to the pain medicine, so it had to be changed today. It appears better now. She walked all the way into the hall today. Hopefully tomorrow or Tuesday, she will be transferred to the rehab hospital. She will stay there for 10-14 days until she is ready to go home. I pray that the miracles from this surgery will begin to open my mom up to the power of God.   On a side note... Super Dad handled all the family problems at church this morning. Cammi had another nose bleed (all over her favorite mommy/daughter matching pooh dress). Rick had to leave the class that he normally leads to take care of that and while dealing with her(helping calm her down, stop the bleeding, send her with one of the ladies from church to borrow some clean clothes), Trace came out of his Sunday School class crying. (Trace has been really tired lately and got upset since he forgot his Bible this morning and could not get settled down again) Rick got everything taken care of and all was well. Thank you Lord for kind wonderful husbands who are amazing beyond words... Yeah, Rick will make some goofy comment about that :)

      Cammi got a nosebleed last night while playing around with Rick and trace. Rick wasn't really worried about it since he has had nosebleed problems all of his life, but this morning she got another one that was really bad.. I finally called the doctor's office. They weren't especially worried about it, and after a while, Cammi was fine.   The kids and I took my mom some balloons and lunch to the hospital. I remember having to take her food that last time she was in there. I just hope we won't be there as long this time. She did well with physical therapy today and she even had the cather removed. Her urinary and bowels appear to be working well.... (Thank you Jesus). They were damaged pretty badly in the last surgery and she has never completely regained full functions, but so far so good so good with this time.  Well I am going back to visit after Fashion Share meeting tonight.

      Well, I spent much less time at the hospital today (only 5 instead of 12). When I got there this morning, mom was being feisty with the nurses. In my mom's case, that is good because she was acting like herself. She wouldn't take any medication until after she had a conference call with her lawyer about her litigation with her former company. Thankfully that only took about 25 minutes and then mom took some medicine. All the junk attached to mom was removed. Mom was especially excited that the IV was removed. Mom's veins are really hard to get needles in and they always leave really bad bruises..  I painted mom's nails and cut up an apple for her. Hospital food is still bland so I even offered to go get her a hotdog, but she no..She wasn't really hungry yet. I ma glad that she is more herself today.

      After 12 hours at the hospital today, I am not feeling very coherent. Mom's surgery took 3 hours and she is through with it and there is a new ball and socket in her hip and the new one should not pop out. That is the good part. The bad part is that the doctor had no conclusive answers to questions like will she be pain free after this procedure.  Right now I feel awful. I ended up by myself asking the doctor questions, but after calling friends and family, I apparently did not ask all the right questions or maybe my family just won't accept the answer "we will have to wait and see" like I did. I do not know. I want a good hot bath, a good cry, and a real night's sleep before I crash right here in front of the PC.  Thank you for the prayers... At least twice this last week, I dreamt that mom did not make it through the surgery. Good night y'all...

      My KINGSIZE bed is too small for the entire family to sleep in so I have come downstairs at 1:00 a.m. and am blogging before I lay down (on the couch) to go to sleep. We had a nice evening. We celebrated Rick's birthday early (tomorrow with mom's surgery, things would have been too hectic). Rick enjoyed his presents, cards, and dinner. By the time I got back from the craft store, Cammi had fallen asleep, so we decided to save Rick's cake for Thursday night. That way we can eat it on Rick's actual birthday. WE all got to our rooms about 10:00 and about 11:00 sleepy Cammi comes in and proceeds to fall asleep on me in our bed. Rick carried her back to her room. At 12:30 Trace came in and said he couldn't sleep and since he's had some trouble sleeping well lately, I let him stay...Within 5 minutes, Cammi came is also. That was when I had to make a decision. Rick was asleep already, so I could either try to put 2 children back in their own rooms by myself, or let both sleep in my bed (both fell back asleep in 3-4 minutes) and take over the couch. I chose the couch. It is more comfortable than either of the kids' beds anyway. Well good night y'all..

      I am taking a moment to write before chaos ensues in my life. Mom just called and said her surgery has been moved forward to 10:00 am and that we have to be at the hospital at 8:30 am. That would not be such a big deal if it weren't for the following things...  1. Tomorrow is Rick's birthday so his plans for coffee with Scott have been altered.  2. I have to clean the kitchen, etc. Tonight   3. I need to lay out stuff since the house is being cleaned tomorrow (a blessing that my mom has done for us every 2 weeks)  4. My car looks awful (assorted kid junk) and mom says we should take it instead of hers...  I am very anxious about this surgery. I have had really bad dreams about it. To add to that, I found out last night that Mom's current hip was made by a company that now has litigation against it for defective hips. Can anything else happen?? Never mind, I did not ask that.   I appreciate all prayer!!!

      Today Mom babysat while I went to school to look over things for the new drama room. Now by saying new drama room, I really mean large dressing room that will act as my teaching space and is next door to the auditorium. The room is much smaller than my current classroom so I am having to purge a lot of my files and junk. That is not necessarily a bad thing, just some hard work. I will take some photos as I finish the room. Hopefully this decision to move will a good idea. I did clean out 3 filing cabinets into 1. That is a positive....Well, I need to email the vice principal about my needs for that room. I can't believe that I go back to school in a month!!

        Mike Krzyzewski has spent 24 years building a legacy at Duke that no current men's college basketball coach can rival. The announcement was welcome news for Duke fans, players and administrators, who had waited anxiously for a decision. When the coach said he waited until Monday morning to call new university president Richard Brodhead because he didn't know Brodhead's sleeping patterns, Brodhead was quick to joke, "They'll be better now."   I admit it... I am a Duke basketball fan, and yes,  PART  of the reason our daughter's name is Cameron is because of this basketball arena (that and the fact that Rick and I wanted unique names for our children). I am glad that Coach K is staying and I do not have to pretend to like pro basketball or the Lakers :)

      Yesterday, Andrea, Anabelle, and I spent most of the day making necklaces and earrings that will be part of the basket that each lady will receive at Fashion Share. It was actually a lot of fun because we sat and talked and laughed as we put together 50 necklaces and 50 pairs of earrings. I basically knew how to make some of the stuff, but Andrea showed me how to use her tools. that was cool. I am going to make some stuff while I am the hospital on Thursday. I think that will be easier than trying to read a book. (The doctor said he had no idea how long Mom's surgery would take!)  Rick and the kids came over and swam with Andrea's oldest son Zach. Justin and Meredith took naps. Who would have thought we could have made that much jewelry with 3 children under the age of 4 in the house (5 under the age of 8 if you count my two children). That was a blessing. Trace , the 8 year old, was so nice to Zach, sharing time on the computer. Cammi was "Little Miss In-Charge" with all the boys telling Trace, Zach, and Justin what all they were going to do. They all obeyed her orders very well.  It was a good day :)

      The weekend has been busy. Yesterday we celebrated not only the birthday of our country but our family celebrated Rick's as well. Rick's birthday is not until Thursday July 8, but Thursday is my mom's surgery. I am far more concerned about this surgery than I have let on to anyone. I keep arguing with myself about faith and knowing God can handle this, but I keep coming back to the doctor who botched this hip replacement on July 8, 2002. I am not mad at him, but concerned about what went wrong. I do not want it to happen again....We still don't know what went wrong (obviously the new doctor will try to answer some of the questions). Here's what went wrong the first time....  1. In the hospital for 5 weeks instead of the original 8-10 days. 2. Lost feeling down one of her legs. Mom still can't feel below her ankle on the leg 3. Lost feeling and some control of her urinary and bowel areas. Still doesn't have all of this but she won't discuss it with me (or anyone except maybe the doctor) 4. Is in more pain than she was before the surgery.  all of the above was contributed to "freaky" stuff that just happens sometimes... YEAH RIGHT!!  Mom made several trips to Duke University but they weren't sure what could be done..  Then last summer, mom was supposed to meet me and the kids at the community pool to swim. Mom was really late so I dried off the kids and we drove around the corner to mom's house. That was the first time Mom's hip came out of place. There is something incredibly frightening about calling EMS about your own parent. (mind you, mom is not old- she is only 59) She informed the nice people in the emergency room that under no circumstances was the original doctor supposed to be called... Mom's language was a little more colorful, but I write a G-rated page her. So now we have a new doctor..  (Funny story about the new doctor- Rick and I ran into an old college friend just a few days before mom's hip popped out. Scott is an orthopedic surgical nurse. He suggested a name if my mom wanted to see someone here in town. That is who the new doctor ended up being. THANK YOU GOD!!  The second time mom's hip came out was just before Christmas while we were at church. Rick was a little annoyed ("Your mom just called during worship.. She knows we are at church") He felt really bad when I told him why as I listened to voice mail. I got home at 2 am that night and had to write lesson plans for school. I have no idea what I wrote. I am just glad that the drama students were good. (sometimes they are not)  The last time was April 1. I remember that because I was told not to leave school (by my mom) and I spent the whole day getting cell phone calls at school about what was happening. That also precipitated my mom losing her job with the company she had been with for 28 years... Yeah, there's litigation going on. There may end up being litigation with the first doctor too.  The original surgery was supposed to be June 3, but the doctor had to put it off because of "parts" that had to be specially made. Now we are all just ready to have it over.  I try to remind myself about my faith in the Lord whom I have seen perform incredible miracles in other people's lives, but not hers yet. Pray for me through this... Please.

      Thank you for the prayers. We have a caterer for Fashion Share. Andrea and Scott from church own a little restaurant, but with three children (the youngest is less than 2 months old) not one would ask them to cater the event. It just seemed like too much. Well, Andrea and I were talking about the Fashion Share meeting the other night because she missed it and she said she and Scott should discuss and pray about catering. Woo Hoo!!! They said yes, if the women of the church could handle desserts. We can do that! I know where the cakes are sold at Bilo. Thanks for the prayers.   Now pray for clothes for these ladies. It does not feel like we have gotten a lot in that way yet, but God is good. Yesterday, my mom, who does not attend church, told me no about donating a few outfits, mainly because she is very sick and did not want to go through the closets. I had told her I would do it all, but after she said no, I just backed off. Today, she called and asked what time tomorrow I could come over and go through her closet with her.  Woo Hoo... God is good all the time.

      I really feel like I have to split my college life into 3-4 parts for several reasons.. Mainly God did so much with me during that time in my life that one blog would take way too long to do. I started at the University of South Carolina in August of 1986. It was the first time I was away from home and I was worried about leaving my mom alone and leaving my boyfriend back in Greenville. Plus, I was scared about going away to school "alone". None of my close friends had come to USC with me. A few days into school, a few people from my high school told me they were going to visit at the Baptist Student Union (BSU). I went along even though I still wasn't impressed with church. I had been going to church with John since I started going out with him, but I still had problems from my past.  The people at BSU seemed nice enough and over the next few days they visited a few times... I don't really remember how I started going regularly and hanging out during that first semester. It must have been God. I tried the bar/party scene but it was uncomfortable especially since I didn't drink. So BSU it was.   Woody Hammett would let me come in his office and sit in talk so many times. I was trying to figure out what I thought about God and everything. I started visiting church with one of my new friends Jenny. Finally Jenny asked me-aren't you going to join? I had never joined a church in my life. I had asked Christ to be my savior as a child, but had never been baptized or anything. We of course were in the balcony, far from the front. It was a long walk, I even slipped and fell on the stairs as I went down.  A few weeks later I was baptized. Looking back, I know I wanted to do what was right in God, but no one had explained to me yet that I needed to rid myself of al the sin in my life.   The were some tumultuous years in college as I fought to be in the world and in God. But I will explain some more about that in my next post...

      Each year, I have to teach my students about what I find acceptable and unacceptable in class and on stage. I generally start that discussion by announcing that my husband is a minister and that I have been a missionary and finish it with "remember, nothing rude, crude, or socially unacceptable." That generally is enough to make the kids be careful of what they say. Of course, it also opens up a whole new conversation which is answered with "No, the youth minister over at Trinity is my brother-in-law, not my husband." :)  Today, I gave Drama I directions for the "bag game". My students have to decorate a brown lunch bag (I stopped in the pouring rain last night to get some)and put some items in it and then tell the class about their bag as an introductory activity. I always have to include "dumb" directions for my students. I have to include these rules about the items in the bags...  a. Nothing alive or that has ever been alive in the bags. (yes, I had a couple of skulls in the bags before)  b. Nothing illegal (every year I have remind several 16 year olds that drinking in SC is not legal until they are 21 regardless of what they did last weekend.)  c. Nothing that can be stepped on and be broken. (I have discovered that teenage boys have big clumsy feet.)  We will see how things work out on Monday. Drama I has the bag game and Drama II and Drama III/IV have performances due. The performances are to be a story that they tell the class. We will see what happens.

      Officially, the school year is 180 days. We have made it through the first one and have 179 more to go. Trace and Cammi had great days and enjoyed riding the bus over to the high school. Trace is in third grade now and Cammi in first. T gets to change classes for reading and science which he thinks is cool. Cammi got to sit next to her friend Hope in class today so first grade was cool too. I am glad that they like school, but we are going to have to work on proper etiquette for being in high school with me. Here's the list of what they did today..  1. Cammi and Trace were loud in the halls. They arrive at 2:45 and school for me isn't over until 3:20. So we are walking down the hall with them talking in their "outdoor" voices about what had happened during the day.  2. Cammi went into the principal's office to see if he had any candy. Mr. J let her do that this summer when we went by school. Fortunately, he was not with a parent, bad student, etc...  3. We have chairs outside the principal's offices where students sit and wait when they are in trouble. Trace flopped down across it sideways with his long legs hanging over one side and his head over the other side. Then he announced in a loud voice "Mom, I'm bored!". I felt like announcing "and I am embarrassed!"  4. As school ended, the door to my room was open. Cammi went in the hall to watch all the band members walk out to practice with their instruments. She tried to get the drummers to let her play their instruments and then proceeded to ask a student I did not even know if she could have some of his candy.   Well other than that, my day went well considering I had not computer, no overhead, chalkboard, etc. to write on, no TV and you can barely hear the announcements or bell. A positive from that is that the students were really quiet when someone was talking on it. Over all a good day, but I am going to hate being the fashion police. I honestly cannot believe that parents let their children wear some of the things I saw today. Rick would have sent Cammi right back up the stairs to find one of Trace's shirts and some sweat pants if she ever wore the kind of shirts some of these girls had on.  Well, time to write some lesson plans for tomorrow. Good night y'all.

      That is the sound my printer is making on the night before the first day of school. I am taking five minutes (and five minutes only) to type in my blog. Today was good at school. The dressing room is now a classroom and I have gotten lots of laughs over my new quarters. The joke is that if they had moved me another 10 feet I would have been out of the school. They are right. I am right by the side door.   I am trying to get all my new lesson plans created (I had to redo the first set because I do  NOT  have access to the auditorium on the first or second day of school. I have been surfing the web for "classroom" friendly lessons that I can use in my small room. Well the printer has stopped momentarily, so I better get back to typing so I can finish sometime tonight.  Good Night!!

      You will find that as the school year starts, that you will see more stories about my "kids" at school than Trace and Cammi. It is not that these kids are more important, but because, they are my ministry and I love them too. But do not worry, Cammi and Trace do enough weird things that I am sure we will have plenty to write about there also. But now for my blogging for tonight.  I do not pretend to understand God or my function as a teacher sometimes. Tonight, as I finish up my homework, I have a heavy heart. One of my former students A. and her younger sister J. came by to see me. I will have J. in a few days and she is one of those "interesting" children of mine. Her hair is currently green and she like to try to freak out the "normal" kids. They were telling me about one of my other former students. G.   G. was a nice Christian kid who was loving God in spite of some horrible home life situations. He and I had several conversations about honoring parents who do not love or honor God. He went off to college a few years ago ( A Christian college) and I don't know what exactly happened. I have never heard, but apparently he is a "freak" now with wild body piercing, tattoos, leather clothes and a lifestyle that my kids said "you don't want to know about." G. is on my heart tonight and I pray that God will bring him back to Him. I pray that whatever has happened to cause this transformation will be healed and that someone will remind G. that God does love him.  On the opposite side of that is my joyful heart. When I took the graduate class a few weeks ago, I was in there with Trace and Cammi's art teacher. She and I have become friends over the last few years due to classes together and assorted arts events we have worked at, and also because I teach her wild nephew. Wild nephew has dealt with a lot in his life too. His dad is in jail. His mom recently fought cancer and has had assorted bad boyfriends so his aunt checks on how he is doing at school through me ever so often. K. stopped me at the district wide staff meeting this morning. She ran up, grabbed my hand and said "Guess what happened last Monday?" I thought it might be something with her dating life since she had just met a nice  guy when we were in class a few weeks ago, but her answer was ... " D. ACCEPTED CHRIST" I almost started crying right there. I am crying now as I type this.  Lord, be with both of these boys. They have endured more at their young age then many of us will ever endure. I pray for Your peace to be with them and for You to be all they need. I pray for Godly friends and mentors. I pray the Joy that only comes from You to be in their lives.   AMEN.

      Remember when you were a kid and you couldn't sleep the night before school started because you were so excited? I was like that every year, but tonight, I am kind of nervous about going back to school. I have made many changes this year and I am kind of scared that things are not going to go well. I even had an anxiety attack earlier tonight. I haven't had one all summer and the have been much farther apart than they were this time last year.  My room change has me concerned mainly because the room upgrades have not been made that were said that were going to be made. Also, they (administration and Guidance) have not lowered the number of students enrolled in Drama so I have 2 classes that have 30 in them. I am used to classes with 30 in them, but I am very concerned about that number in the new classroom.   I am also anxious about National Boards. I am notorious about putting things off until the last minute and I am worried I will not do what I need to in order to pass this bear of a test.  Also, this year, Trace and Cammi are not going to stay in the after school group at their elementary school, but are going to ride the bus over to my school in the afternoon. There are about 6-7 children of teachers coming over. They are very excited and i hope that things will go well. I have my planning period at the need of the day so they will not interrupt my classes, but I have to be more organized about homework, playing, etc.  Well, I have much to do before I head to bed. I pray I will sleep tonight. I could not sleep last night. I did not go to bed until after 3:00 am.. (made getting up and ready for church a little hard this morning). Good night all.

      Rick and I rarely argue and when we do, it tends to be me losing my temper and him still remaining calm. But even though he did not say so, I think I might have annoyed him today about his car. I am writing this as a (hopefully) humorous apology for my smart mouth about Rick's car ( I called it  Yucky ). Here's what happened.  I drove Rick's car today. I generally do NOT like his vehicle for several reasons.   1. Rick bought a black car in January in SC. I was driving tis vehicle in JULY in SC. 2. It is much smaller (Honda CRV) than my mammoth mommy mobile (Ford Expedition). 3. And most importantly, Rick and I have differing philosophies concerning the upkeep of vehicles.  Rick believes that a car's function is to get you from point A to point B and that you should have good tunes to listen to on the way. (Hence the reason he has XM radio and a full container of CDs in his car). The amount of assorted junk amassed in the vehicle from children, school, church, drive-thrus, etc. is completely irreleveant to the driving experience.  I, on the other hand, believe that periodically a garbage bag must be used inside a vehicle (mine gets the garbage bag treatment about once a week) and soap and water on the outside (mine gets the washing about once a month) to maintain the driver's ability to function while driving. And Rick remains befuddled at my belief that music is not primary factor in the driving experience. I tend to listen to Disney tunes or whatever the kids want to hear.  Anyways, this morning I had to drive Rick's car. He took my car (and our children) to the children's outreach with church. My job was to clean the house, help my mom with a water problem she was having, and the have the oil chenged in his car. I did staighten up the house, I did check on my mom, and as I headed out to get the oil changed,  I did decide that it was time.....   I pulled into the gas station, got out and began to throw away all the junk (yes, I probably did throw away something he wanted, but it will be weeks before he figures out what it is). After I threw away large quantities of "stuff", I pulled over to the carwash. I had the car washed and vacuumed. I even bought Armour-all and cleaned his dashboard, etc. The car looked so good coming out of the car wash. The tires sparkled, the car was black colored, not dirt colored. It even smelled good. I should have thrown away the coffee flavored mints, but I left them for my sweetie and vowed never to taste them again. Some things are best not shared!!  Afterwards, I did get the oil changed.  I was so excited that I actually took Rick's car on all the other errands I did during the day. Now Rick will say thank you for my work, but he won't really notice how different it looks as long as I return the seat to the correct position so he does not bang is knees as he leaves for church in the morning and make sure the radio station is set correctly for him. It doesn't matter.   I usually get Rick's car cleaned out about once a year or so. I really don't think he takes his car in to be washed any other time. I have teased him about his car all day. I hope he does realize that it was done in love (the teasing and the cleaning).  Good night y'all.

       Friendly reminder : This week is  Casting The Net Sunday . Our service will be "shorter", geared more towards evangelism in the sense that we will tell the world that Jesus saves and that the Kingdom is at hand, and we'll be watching a film:  ESCAPE FROM HELL .  Invite anyone and everyone. When  urlLink Jesus told the disciples to cast their nets into deep water , the only fish caught would be ones who  *wanted*  to be caught. So if you're not inviting someone, either there's no one around you  *wanting to get caught*  - and that's quite possibly on your shoulders, living out Jesus in front of them every day - or you don't have a net - again, might be on your shoulders to strike up the conversation in deep water.  I look forward to seeing you, and your fishy friends, this weekend.  - peace - rick

      I think the last few months have been this huge pothole that I hit that made me wake up.  I was just on cruise control down the road of life until then.  Now since Mike's cancer diagnosis and treatment, I am beginning to ask a lot of questions I never thought of before.  A lot of things have been different.   We started hiring babysitters and doing stuff together for fun, because after all, our life was passing our marriage by.  We started "weekend living" every night of the week.  Enjoy every moment you can.  You know, renting movies and eating homemade cookies.  Until you start craving some balance in your life and missing wierd things like routine and discipline (and a few vegetables).  I'm thankful that God is there to lean on in the things I dont know.  But I have also realized that there is a ton of stuff I don't know and I'm mad at God for it.    I want life to never be the same again since cancer entered it, and I just want things to go back to the way they were at the same time.    Why are the doctors telling Mike he will survive his cancer and telling my best friend's mother that she will die from hers?  Who's life is God at work in?  We're so quick to give God all the glory for one, but what about the other? Does God get the victory in Ms. Joyce's life too?  So many questions, just as many opportunities to trust and have faith.  Is faith faking what you don't know until you talk yourself into it?  Claiming healing when you're dying?  Saying you have peace when you can't sleep?  Saying you trust God in the face of your questions?    I don't ever want to go back to blindly going through life again, but at the same time, I 'd just like one week without the big stuff hanging over me.  It would be so refreshing to just for one day only have to think about what I'm going to cook for supper.  I think I'm losing it.  I'm learning that even when the treatment ends, cancer will always be a part of our lives.  Continuous checks for relapse, always having to deal with it, never being able to put it behind you.  I feel like I took a deep breath last October and have not been allowed to let it out, relieve the presssure,and let that isolated experience find its way into our past.  Instead, I have learned that I will never be able to exhale this one, it will always be a part of our present, a stress that I am ready to give up but don't have the luxury of doing.  Asking the tough questions is tiring, and not getting too many answers is making me weary.  Why am I making such a big deal out of cancer?  We're all terminal after all, and thank God, because then we get to really start living.  Maybe I'm way too satisfied with this life.  Want to feel secure and safe, and in control, like I used to.  But that is a lie/deception from the enemy.  You never really are secure and in control.  You just think you are.  Maybe ignorance really is bliss. But the word says, "They perish for their lack of knowledge."  So do I feed my spirit or the flesh?  I'm tired.  This is mind-boggling.  So, I guess I'll continue to say I have faith in the midst of my fears/qeustions/doubts and pray for answers to the tough questions or that they would just go away as mysteriously as they showed up.   I know this isn't a great debut on the blog, but it is kind of nice just to sit and type and get it out. Maybe I can be my more "put together" self next time.

      For those of you who were late to church this morning, you missed out - and it was something you probably needed. Now I don't throw that around flippantly - I hate it when people use that to make others feel bad; it feels manipulative most of the time. But today, I mean it - we all need the encouragement of watching  urlLink first love , and, well, if you missed it, you missed it.  This morning, three young men were baptized: Jermaine, Coutrney and Michael - and there was such a spirit of encouragement in the building. It was refreshing, and I remembered back to my own dunking, and to seeing others light up as they made this public, symbolic confession before their friends and family. There's something physically spiritual about the whole thing - making real and tangible what you know is going on inside of this new brother in the Lord.  So be encouraged - even if you missed today's service, or if you were running a little late. Your  urlLink salvation  is full of  urlLink encouragement  for the Christian. Coming together,  urlLink we encourage one another, and keep each other from stumbling ... and I was reminded of that this morning.

      I hope this blog flies. I mean, we have some talented people in our midst, with bright ideas and good comunication skills. For now, this outlet is a wonderful way to document what we're doing, how we're doing it, and what's happening in us and through us in the midst of it all. But in the meantime, it's hard to get motivated, you know?  I guess the addage  if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well  might come into play here. I'm not sure I've done a good job expressing the  it's worth doing  part. I think everyone would do it well, if convinced it was worth it. And that probably goes for alot of things in life: work, school, family life. If we could only be convinced that it was worth doing - not just something we plod through or tolerate in our existence, but something of real, longterm and transformational value - I would like to think I and alot of other folks would be more apt to do our best and give it a good effort.  So I'll be the cheerleader, trying to extol the benefits of a *free* outlet for our story. And while I don't envision this site being overtly evangelistic, I do think that our story is the greatest witness we have to God's faithfulness and the advancement of His kingdom in our midst.

      I am tired and feel like I am getting the flu so I was not all there mentally or physically at church this morning, and I would like to say that I heard a lot of what Pastor Mike said this morning in our service, but he pretty much lost me after he said "you cannot mock God"... At first, I wanted to say, "I do not mock my God, I am not that stupid..." but somehow that this just not true... I think I have missed His truth in my life so many times, that I have probably mocked Him more than I really want to admit. I still can't get the phrase out of my head. We were in  urlLink Galatians 6  (Verses 7-8, and of course a lot of other places). I am going to have to think about these verses this week. I don't know when and where I have mocked my Lord, but it is something I need to pray about this week. I also need to focus on the places in my life that sow into the flesh.. I agree that too many times we hear a message and focus on which of our friends or family members that needed to hear it. Well I needed this morning's message, and I want to search this week for the ways the message this morning applied to me. (Well, really my lazy nature doesn't). Pray for my own quest this week.

      This has been our "logo shot" since the beginning of  urlLink CWO . I like the depths of the blues, and I think the ripples and the bounce are cool. Our vision of being  "a healing place for a hurting world"  (or  un lugar curativo para un mundo herido  in spanish) is captured a little in this pic, I think. Anyway, I'm trying to see if our church could participate in a team blog, where we write what's on our hearts, journal our church history, etc.

      I think that the idea of having a "community journal" is very intriguing.  urlLink Columbia World Outreach  is about six years old (I think that's right), and this local body of believers has had such an impact on my own spiritual journey, that I'd love to "document" what's going on for each of us. I've got plenty of outlets, but to do something like this with a "team" of writers, and with the ability to add comments for anyone else, is really cool.  I'll probably start with an exercise in documenting our "history" - looking back at where we've been and what has shaped us. Would be helpful in envisioning what God's calling to become further down the road.  I look forward to everyone hopping onboard.

      I just  urlLink finished an interesting book , and one of the characters detailed a "new" way of telling God's story. I might miss a few of the actual points from the novel, but these are the alliterations that are standing out to me right now.   Creation:  God's imagination spins a world of beauty, love, power. This is the first thing outside of God - before that, there was nothing but God. So He sets into motion this system/universe that's ever growing, ever re-creating, ever changing and evolving and growing. As chapter one, this part of the story is still running, as man is placed into the story and allowed to create alongside the Creator.   Crisis:  When man decides that he does not need God to find out what's real and what's not, the line of communication is severed. There's now a counterflow to the first two chapters, as all three continue to be played out in history. Man thinks he can get by without God; God knows man is dead by himself. This chapter is still being written, too.   Calling:  Abraham and his family are called of God as an "anti-Crisis attack force," specifically outfitted for being counter to the counterflow of man's sin and selfishness. God says that He will bless His people to be a blessing, to bring real life and change back into the picture. Like the others, this chapter continues on, doesn't it?   Conversation/Cycles:  God also begins to speak with His creation through 4Ps: poets, prophets, philosophers and priests. He speaks intermittently, with no rhyme or reason to His interaction or intervention. But this is the beginning of a counterflow to the counterflow - and it is still flowing today, as people follow God, and turn away, and follow Him anew, and...   Christ:  God Himself enters into the story, telling of a revoutionary lifestyle of selflessness and other-serving-hearts. All of the major players are wrong. The Zealots don't need to fight. The Pharisees don't need to rely on legalism. The people don't have to feel forsaken by their God as a "chosen people." Jesus comes as a man who forgives sin, lifts burdens, heals hearts and bodies. And when He dies, and then returns from death, He cries that God's way is higher, more noble, more potent in righting the story we find ourselves in.  "The real revolution emerges above or beyond all that - or maybe I should say  ahead  of all that"  (p. 120 - anyone else see anything apostolic in that statement?).   Church:  Basically, people join in God's lifestyle by following Christ and jumping into the collaboration for these continuing chapters. As life unfolds, the story is told in suffering, selflessness, humility and growing in Christ-likeness.   Consummation:  In the end, God stands at the future beckoning us to Himself. Rather than all events pushing us into the future, I'm challenged to think of the passing of time as the past dropping away and the future somehow quickly filling the void. We're being drawn forward to the climax of it all, real unity and community in Christ. We will see ourselves - all of ourself, every nuance and thought and action - and we will see God in perfect judgment. The story continues to this point, and then establishes, perhaps an even greater and continuing beginning.  Whew - peace to you.

      Well, it's in the books - the  First CWO Golf Tournament . We had lots of fun - and swung the clubs way too much. Our team lost - collectively could not putt, and consistently 50 yds short. The Thurber Brothers took  Closest To The Pin  (Marcus) and  Longest Drive  (Scott), and Pastor Mike's team won the event at 2-under.

       urlLink :: BLIND - by Angela Wallace, @ RelevantMagazine.com   In this article, Wallace tells of seeing two blind men trying to lead each other, or find the door on a train together. She writes that "I get squeamish at considering such obvious parables." Don't we see the same thing - people all around us, in the church and on the outside, poking around because they can't see and can't understand what they're looking for, desperate to help each other but destined to fail because no one really sees what's going on?   May we open our eyes, Lord - and see You.

Let the Blog begin AGAIN,  I want to share with yall some affirmations that I saw today.  Yesterday during worship, I deeply felt a healing in Pastor Mike.  This afternoon I was at the park with my sister-in-law Shannon(which we haven't really talked in over a month), and we were talking about the Lord.  She asked about Pastor Mike.  And then she told me how weird it was that she is praying for three people  who have Lymphoma.  Then she said that she knows Pastor Mike is healed, and she doesn't know why she doesn't get the same assurance of healing when she prays for the other two.  She boldy told me that Pastor Mike is healed.    Then Shannon told me that she had read Pastor Rick's E-mail about Cammie.  Shannon also has the same thing Cammie has.  She was diagnosed in High-school after complaining about feeling like she could faint.  Now she can feel the flutterings whenever she is stressed out, or when she has had too much Caffeine. Then she tells me that this morning she was babysitting her friends little girl while her friend was going to the doctor.  Her friends report from the doctor Today, was what Cammie has.  Anyway, Yesterday, I had never even heard of Cammie' s diagnosis, and today I know two others that have it.  now to Blog I've been thinking of the differences between Fairness and Justice.  I believe they are two completely different things, yet I believe we take offense because we may try to bring them together.  I want to do some indepth study on this because I see so much Jealousy and Hatred that comes when things are not Fair.  What's Fairness  got to do with it.   Joseph and His Brothers, Israel(apple of God's eyes),  Cain and Able, Jacob and Esau, objects of mercy objects of wrath, Sarah and Hagar, John(who Jesus loved) and Peter, Pharoah, the blind man from birth, the workers who get paid the same, and -----------? I want to look for some correlations with these and discover some attitudes of the heart.  love yall, andrea

      Hi Folks!  What an encouraging service today!  Connie and I have been sooooo encouraged the past year that we have been at CWO!  One thing that has been very important to us is that week after week we have not only been encouraged, but we are challenged.  Pastor Mike always brings us to a point of decision.  Nothing is questionable in our hearts as we leave each service.  Either we obey the Holy Spirit or we don't.  (Obedience is better!)  After being in the full-time ministry since 1985 it has been very challenging to lay it all aside for the past year (so far).  But looking back, Connie and I can see God's hand in it.  As a matter of fact, we can clearly see the work He has done (and still doing) in our hearts.  God is preparing us all for the next level.  It requires a deeper passion and commitment.  He loves us so much that He will see that we are prepared - one way or the other!    I like what Pastor David said today.  "If you keep on doing what you've always done, you will always have what you've always had."  (Steve's paraphrase).  I was really challenged today to  do  more!  We can hope, pray, and confess more, but we also must do more.  Once I heard Ron Luce say that if you don't know more scripture today than you did at this time last year, you're not growing in Christ.  I am really challenged to press on to do more.  I know the results will be the proof!  Blessings! Steve

       urlLink Time Changer   Pastor Danny recommended this film. I hadn't seen anything on it, but it looks like it's in limited release in select cities/theaters, possibly underwritten by local churches and associations. Looks like it would be thoughtful and through-provoking, though. It's playing here in town at the Columbiana Grande. If I get to see it this weekend, I'll post a review - maybe get Pastor Danny to throw out some props, too.

       urlLink Bible study method   Andrew Jones shares seven questions (taught to him by Thom Wolf) for a pretty deep/impromptu bible study session:  1. What word or phrase "shimmered" or stuck out?   2. What did you like best about the passage?   3. What did you like least?   4. What did you learn about God?   5. What did you not understand or find puzzling?   6. What do you think applies to people today?   7. If you were to choose a sentence or phrase to meditate on this week, which would it be? And why?   He gives  urlLink John 15:1-8  as the passage a group used. Got any thoughts? Answers from that passage to some of these questions?

      Pastor Mike is heading to Duke Medical Ctr next week for the month-long procedure of his bone marrow transplant. And whether he's bald or not - we're going to miss him and Dawn. Be in prayer for them and for the kids - alot of you are helping out by taking meals or watching kids, and the encouragement means alot to them, I know. But there's all kinds of other hassles, too. Mostly, they'll miss being together. Pray for the Comforter to comfort, for grace to be such an encouragement in their souls, and for such a love to grow in their midst that this time apart will build relationship within theit family.  I'm hoping Pastor and Dawn will BLOG more, too. If they do, be sure to interact in their comments sections, ok?

      Dying?  Today, I saw something that has brought such comfort and relief to me, that I thought I would Blog. I was praying for my family to know Jesus, and in my thoughts a question was posed, "Maybe if you die, and at your funeral your family will get saved."  " Will you give up your life for that?"  "What greater sacrifice can you give, but your life?"  I start thinking of this and questioning it and seeing the ends results of my death, and even fearing. Then I saw this prideful lie, and I realized that my life can't give life to anybody, and my death surely can't.  It's not me, but Jesus, and the sacrifice has already been paid.  The Seed has already died, and the Christ has already resurrected.  I recognized the lie, and replaced it with Truth.  Jesus came to give us LIfe.  He is The seed that fell and died, The only Imperishable Seed.  And Praise God, He didn't stay dead, but Lives.  Now we too Live Forever with Him.  My life Hidden in Christ will bring LIfe whether today or at my funeral.  And Praise God even at that time, I too will not stay there long, because the first and last will be Faithful to see me Home forever.

      We're driving to Gainesville, GA, today for the spring  urlLink Cleansing Streams  regional retreat. I've been a few times before, and we're taking 18 people this time - biggest group we've had make it to the retreat. We've been meeting once a month or so since January, watching a video together and then "doing the homework" - a woorkbook and tapes/book. and it builds to this: a weekend away to deal with personal baggage and with God.  I'm not much into "deliverance ministry" - there are often too many things that are screwy and over-sensationalized, without alot of discipleship and real change. This set is different. By studying for four months, you get steeped in real freedom. Starting with Alignment - where you're challenged to walk by the Spirit, not by the soul (mind/will/emotions) or the body - and culminating this weekend as we deal finally with the particulars of pride, rejection, abuse, etc, there's a sense that this is real and transforming in our lives if we'll take the time to walk it out, and if we'll allow Christ to set us free.  I'll report back after the weekend.

      We're a healing place for a hurting world. That's a part of the vision that God has planted in Pastor for CWO. But what about other things, other thoughts about what a church like ours is supposed to be...?  A restful place for a busy world An accepting place for a judgmental world A mourning place for a numb world A joyful place for a depressed world A meaningful place for a meaningless world A worshipping place for a self-seeking world A pursuing place for a rundown world A peaceful place for a messy world A messy place for a perfectionist world An out-of-the-box place for a boxed-in world A courageous place for a hopeless world  Just thinking.

       Here's an update from Dawn on Pastor Mike's continuing progress. He's in for another round of procedures this morning, and will hopefully be driving home TOMORROW. The kids are up in Durham with them, so they're enjoying some family time already, and looking forward to being back in Columbia with the rest of us, too! - rick   Hi to all.....Mike is doing well.  After the first 3 days, Mike's blood counts started to fall off - all the way to nothing.  His white blood cell count showed up on his lab work as >0.1.  That means that they could not detect any in his blood at all.  With the drop in blood counts came the nausea and vomiting.  Days 4-8 we spent every hour day and night trying to get on top of the vomiting.  We would go to the clinic every morning and they would pump him up with meds to get through to the next day.  But we had to go back into the hospital every night betwen 11-2 to get more IV meds to get him through to the next morning.  The vomiting was relentless. But after Day 8 we finally were able to keep it at bay.  The low blood counts last until your stem cells that were transplanted (day 0) engraft.  That means they found their way back into your bone marrow, settled in, and began to grow and produce blood cells again.  (That's what bone marrow does).   This usually happens around day 10.  The first thing you see coming up is the white cell count.  Then the red follows and finally you make your own platelets and you see  that count start creeping up too.  Getting back to normal takes some time, but seeing them start going up is what everyone looks for.  By day 9 Mike saw his white count go from >0.1 to 0.1.  We thought that was the start of engraftment.  By day 10, his white count was up to 5.3 (normal already) and he was already making his own platelets.  He got off some of the pain meds he was on, and we discovered that the little cough he had was really a severe cough with lots of wheezing and crackling, although his lungs sounded clear.  Apparently the narcotic was relaxing the soft tissue of his bronchials enough to mask the cough a bit.  They were talking on Friday about going home Monday or Tuesday, but the cough has set us back a bit.  They want to do a CT scan, another pulmonary functon test, and test his mucous for viral infection. There are several possibilities of what it could be: viral, irritation caused by the preservative his stem cells were frozen in, damaged lung tissue caused by the chemo, the beginnings of pneumonia, or something called pneumanitis, which is also caused by chemo.  Some are treatable, some are not, but he is not a classic case of any of them, so they want to use all these tests to try and figure it out.  So now it looks like we will be here until Wed or Thursday.  Fatigue has set in.  Mike is impatient with this. He's feeling good enough to be frustrated with the fact that he's not quite up to his usual pace - full tilt.  He's anxious to put all this behind him and get back to life full steam ahead, but he's realizing that when they say you leave the clinic to go home for the recovery phase, they aren't overstating the situation.  He doesn't understand why he's so tired, and I say, "I do.  You've just had a transpant."  All our information tells us that most transpant patients arent up to full time work until 6 months after transpant and it takes a full year to recover completely.  Mike is going to have to learn to be patient with his body.  It's doing all it can to catch back up to life.  He has a brand new immune system now, and it takes a lot of energy to re-establish all that as well as rebuild normal amounts of blood cells from none at all only a week ago.  We miss the children enormously.  They have had a ball in our absence.  Uncle Wayne, Grandpa Bud and Nanna Carol, Carlos and Sherry, Anabelle, Candice, and now Titi Omi have filled in very well.  They kids have been on a three week long vacation.  But now that Mike's counts are back up, we are trying to get them up here to see us.  Maybe they can stay the next few days with us, and we can all go home together.  Thank you for all your support and prayers, your help with our home and our children, everything everyone has done.  We are indebted to you always for all your help.  Love, Dawn

      This is a post from Pastor Mike, even though I signed in under Dawn's blogger id.    BMT Process: June 5 - 10 -  As I reflect on all the chemotherapy I received back in Charleston, SC, I realized it was a pretty easy walk in comparison to the BMT process.  The 6 days in the hospital were absolute torture to my body.  Only God could keep a man sane on the other side of this experience.  I was given a scripture by my mother from Mark 16:18 in which Jesus said, "They will pick up snakes with their hands; And when the drink deadly poison (chemo) it will not harm them at all.  They will place thier hands on sick people and they will get well."  Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus.  The Lord has been speaking to me and I pray I will obey his voice.  My spirit is willing, yet my flesh is weak.  Day 0 - June 11, 2003 - Transplant.  This was a tough day; I felt very weak, but my stem cells were reinfused.  Dawn called it a new birthday; my cells had been re-planted to start new life.  I quickly realized the absolute necessity of being born again spiritually.  I heard the words of Jesus again, "Unless a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom."  In the physical, I have not been good to my body.  I have treated it unkindly, disrepectfully.  The Holy Spirit has dealt with me at this time.  I must treat this body as what it really is - the temple of God.  Only He can and will give me the strength because it is his will in Christ Jesus to live a healthy, disciplined lifestyle, that I might honor him, spirit, soul, and body.  My body must become a slave of righteousness!  Getting back to the spiritual, there is no way to see the kingdom, to work for the kingdom, to do the will of the kingdom, unless there is a change - a reinfusion of life from dead works to serve the living God.  One must pass from death into life.  There is no other way.  One cannot come on his own terms because there is nothing good within man.  All his spiritual cells are poluted with sin.  He cannot on his own merit gain holiness and the glory of God.  He must come through the cross, where the blood of the Lamb is able to transfuse him from death to life.  Glory be to God, for Jesus and His blood.  Day 1 - June 12, 2003 - Started out rough!  I had a little better sleep, but awoke dizzy and nauseated.  I feel as if there is simply no way to go on physically, and yet in my weakness, Jesus is strong.  All flesh must be stricken - stripped and eradicated of its pride so there can be nothing to depend on or rely upon except God and God alone.  The apostle Paul said it this way, "For it is we who are the circumcision, we who worship by the Spirit of God, who glory in Christ Jesus, and who put no confidence in the flesh."  Flesh is good for nothing but to be consecrated and given over to the One who created it.  I will offer up my body as a living sacrifice to the Lord.  I pray rest tonight and strength for tomorrow.  Day 2 is getting closer to the goal.  Thank you, Jesus.  Day 2 - June 13, 2003 -  Had a better day today.  It began in the presence of the King as I worshipped before the throne.  My physical strength is better today even though my blood work shows quite the opposite.  My hemoglobin was low, my white blood cell count was very low, my platelet count almost gone, and yet probably the best day yet strength-wise.  Only God could do something like this!  He truly is great.  He's still working miracles.  Today, in my study of the scripture, I came across a verse in John 5:39 where Jesus said to the Jews when they were angry with him because he claimed to be God, "You diligently study the scriptures because by them you posess eternal life.  These are the scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life."  So many are decieved and have an earthy believism about a God they have never come to.  And even though they know the scripture and study them diligently, they still don't know Jesus.  What a tragedy, a trama, a catastrophy to be deceived and not know it.  By the end of the day, my body collapsed as a direct result of what my blood work really showed.  Though all outward appearance I looked strong, I was really weak.  Yes, God gave me supernatural strength, yet my point is what really is shall be revealed.  And what is not shall be exposed.  Jesus said, "You will recognize them by their fruit."  He also said, "Hereby, we know that we know Him, if we keep his commandments.  He that says he knows him and keeps not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him."  1 John 2:3-4    Day 3 - June 14, 2003 - Began better than any other day so far.  I didn't have any nausea and felt pretty good overall.  When I arrived at the clinic, I soon realized that my blood counts were way down and I needed a blood transfusion.  Two units of blood were given to me from someone I will never know.  This is so selfless and self-giving.  I feel very humbled to receive it.  What a cost!  Yes, it may not seem much, but that person had to leave their comfortable home or office, go give blood (life) so that someone else could have a chance at life.  There was a sacrifice, there was love and thought, and ultimately, there was the shedding of blood through a needle.  OH THE COST.  He left his place of majesty, the God of the Universe, with all power and authority.  He also left the comfort of thousands upon thousands of angels worshipping him.  He was made lower than the angels, being found in human likeness.  His purpose was also to give blood (Life) so that someone else could have a chance at Life. There was great sacrifice.  There was shown great love and thought, and ultimately there was the shedding of blood through nails, not just because of love, but also for the forgiveness of sin.  Oh what a savior He is.

       Update from Dawn, Wednesday evening 11:24pm -   We've been so busy that I havenot had time to write.  Mike is feeling miserable, but they are saying that he is doing great.  He was kicked out of the hospital on Tuesday.  Today was Day 0 - transplant day.  That means that the negative days prior to transplant are behind us, and tomorrow we get into positive days.  Even that just sounds good to me. In the world of transplants, today is Mike's new birthday - a whole new life. So now, apparently Mike has now been born, born again, and then once again.  His very smart baby cells will find their way back into his bone marrow and dig in thier heels and begin reproducing within 10-14 days.  It's quite marvelous, what the human body is capable of.  He is fighting fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and has developed a cough today for which we had to go back to the hospital for a chest x-ray, which checked out ok.  He has also had other digestive stuff - diarrea and mouth pain (which usually turns into mucousitis - one big cancer sore in your mouth and throat). He did not sleep at all last night, but now has a prescription to help with that.  Pray for sleep (for both of us!), the strength and the desire to endure these next 10-14 days of feeling yucky until his blood counts come back up, and for his body to do all the right things quickly.  Pray also that he will be protected from infection and bleeding - which he is very suceptible to right now and could be life threatening....and hum happy birthday for us.  We'll hear you.  Love, Dawn

      Meditation for the week:     urlLink Exodus 20:1-3    urlLink Romans 14     The first commandment was really brought to life yesterday morning in a new video we're watching on the Ten Commandments. The thought that we're to "have no other gods" makes sense when you consider that there are no other gods, and that the Lord has already led us to freedom, already made us free.  The second passage above was Pastor Danny's text yesterday. "Who are you to judge someone else's servant?" We judge too much in the disputable matters, without standing firm nearly enough on those matters that God is clear about. We might turn a blind eye to an affair in the congregation, but watch out if you walk in full of tattoos. We'll be meditating on these two passages this week, wondering where we might be seeking after other gods, and where we are judging others too harshly, or ourselves not harshly enough.  I also went to  urlLink my brother Jeff's church  and heard him preach on "The Perfect Church." Basic premise: we're already in the "perfect church" by being a part of the body of Christ, so now LIVE LIKE IT.

       Second UPDATE from Dawn on Pastor Mike's bone marrow transplant, Duke Medical Ctr:   Good evening,  Just a quick update tonight on Mike.  He had a fantastic day yesterday.  It was the day of rest between chemo doses.  He walked over a mile on the ninth floor, ate well, and was able to rest well too.  Today was another story.  Another high dose chemo drug - this one took 4 hours to infuse.  It made his blood pressure drop to 80/12, which scared me and left Mike feeling lousy.  He then promtly got the shakes and chills.  They could not give him meds for that until his BP was up.  After about 45 minutes of constant shakes (exhausted and achy by then) his bp was respectable enough for some demoral to put his body at rest.  Then came the vomitting and diarreah.  Finally he spiked a fever of 102.5.  When I left this evening, he was asking for prayer and was still burning up.  He said through his tears, "the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." The flesh is weak is an understatement!  I asked his nurse if he would have a good night or not, and she said it could go either way.  It's been a grueling day for him, and my prayer is for a reprieve from the side effects and some much needed rest tonight.  I am claiming the  urlLink Psalm (for which I am too tired to look up the reference [Ps 127:2 - The Message])  that promises that He gives sleep to the ones he loves.  Pray for endurance and focus.  This is no easy task, and something Mike must do virtually alone.  Even I fee helpless to ease the burden.  Please help me pray him through to Tuesday when this wicked high dose chemo is over and he gets to leave the torture chamber.  May God grant us all a good night sleep tonight.  Love. Dawn

       This is an email that Dawn sent last night on Pastor Mike's first days @ Duke Medical for the bone marrow transplant:   Hi all,  We have now been back up at Duke for 2 days. We are now here for the duration.  Yesterday we got the green light after chest x-ray and EKG and lab work and a consult with doc.  This morning we checked in at Admitting and Mike was tanking up on IV fluid by 10 am.  Today he received the first of three high doses of chemo.  It was not much fun - Mike had some nausea and a bad headache.  But his worst symptom was the restlessness - he couldn't be still. He said he wanted to climb out of his skin. The good news was that, even though it felt like forever!) it only took 2 hours for the drug to drip through his IV.  After it finished they were more liberal with the meds to make him more comfortable.  He then slept through the rest.  That being a drastic drop in blood pressure (which they expect).  They were able to bring it back up without using meds, just extra fluid.  By 8 pm he was attempting to eat supper and was a little more alert, even though it was a very difficult day.    Tomorrow he gets to rest and then chemo #2 will be on Saturday.  Pray that he is able to rest tonight.  His spirits are up and his sights are set on the future - when this whole thing will be behind him.  Pray also for my father and stepmother, who are on kid duty back home.  They have both been hit with some kind of stomach bug - diarreha and nausea.  Carol even had to see the doctor today, and spent most of yesterday in bed.  Just pray for healing all around! And that my children aren't too spoiled by the time we get home!  It doesn't look good on that front.  A million thanks for all everyone is doing to get this big job done.  It is humbling to be so loved.  I am speechless in response.  Love, Dawn

       urlLink  Article - Facing The Challenge: We don't do God     "In a recent interview for Vanity Fair magazine, reporter David Margolick asked Prime Minister Tony Blair about his Christian faith. In a remarkable demonstration of the power of unelected media manipulators, chief spin-doctor Alistair Campbell interrupted the Prime Ministers reply to say Im sorry, we dont do God."   In our society and culture today (this article is based on events in Britain, but it could be in Washington, DC or any other city on this side of the pond), religion is becoming increasing irrelevant in the lives of people. This is a time for us as Christians to live life right and righteously in a way that shows in action and verbalizes in conversation just how relevant the  relationship  really is.....

      It's been awhile since anyone's updated this blog. But life goes on, doesn't it? In fact, it is most probably "life" that has kept us too busy to be concerned with documenting "life" - right? Not that it's a bad thing - not everyone grabs onto the blog concept as much as I'd like, and that's okay in the scheme of things. Relationships being what they are, I don't know that building them in virtual space is that much more connecting than the real life phone call or dinner invitation. A blog like this one can only be an extension of the relationships already developed, not a substitute or even a catalyst for them. I'll continue to post from time to time, and I'll add some code to check for visitors (I know you're out there). In the meantime, comment as you will, or as you won't - and add your two cents worth to the continuing heart/thought process.....

       urlLink Welcome to Mount Paran North Church of God   This is where the  urlLink Cleansing Streams  Retreat has been moved for this fall. Closer to Atlanta, might shave some time off our drive. And we might be able to get some better deals on hotels. We've got nine people this time around - pray that all of us really *want* to follow through, and that we'll all go to the retreat and drop life's baggage at the throne.....

      We finished up the month-long look at the  urlLink Sermon on the Mount  this morning. I've enjoyed it, getting to dig into a passage that most of us "know" fairly well and somehow bringing something new and challenging out of it. In wrapping up Matthew 6, I focused on keeping our eyes on the kingdom, storing our treasure in heaven, letting our eyes focus on the light of the kingdom, letting our worship and service be for God instead of Money. Then, with that focus, we will realize that there's no need to worry about our needs getting met, because we'll "see" God providing. And there's no need to worry about tomorrow, either, since right now probably has enough to keep us busy. If we make God & His righteousness our priority - keeping our treasure secure with Him, focusing on Him, serving/following Him - then "all these things will be added."  In Chapter 7, I made the transition from "don't worry about your needs today or your troubles tomorrow" into "how do you handle the past?" Jesus talked about passing judgment, how we can remove the plank of judgmentalism and actually be able to "judge" and help someone remove their plank of sin. Forgiveness is so huge - we can ask for it, seek it, and knock on its door, and God is faithful to give us what we've asked for. What if we were to give forgiveness so that we'd get it in return, pressed down, shaken together and running over? What if we were to ask the Father to "forgive them for they know not what they do", instead of pointing the finger at folks when they screw up?  Finally, Jesus wraps up the talk by saying to put these things into practice. Practice these things. Run drills and meditate on the goodness of God, the attributes of kingdom-life, the fundamentals of living as citizens of heaven who are ambassadors to this culture. Like I said, good stuff, and I really appreciated people listening and putting these things into practice in their lives, too.

      Got this in my inbox this morning ( urlLink Daily Dig from Bruderhof ): A Matter of Life and Death William Willimon  The church of today lives in an ethically debilitating climate. Where did we go wrong? Was it the urbane self-centeredness of Peale's "Power of Positive Thinking" and its therapeutic successors? Was it the liberal, civic-club mentality of the heirs to the Social Gospel? Now we waver between evangelical TV triumphalism with its Madison Avenue values or live-and-let-live pluralism which urges open-mindedness as the supreme virtue. And so a recent series of radio sermons on "The Protestant Hour" urged us to "Be Good to Yourself." This was followed by an even more innocuous series on "Christianity as Conflict Management." Whatever the gospel means, we tell ourselves, it could not mean death. Love, divine or human, could never exact something so costly. After all, our culture is at least vestigially Christian. Isn't that enough?  The answer to that last question is of course "no" - and I agree that we have watered down the Gospel into something of a self-help mantra. How many people sitting in pews every Sunday are deceived into thinking they've got hell-fire insurance, when in reality they've only bought into a humanistic form of religion? We've bought into form over substance - doing the right things, looking the right way, having the right attitude, and never really dying to themselves and living to Christ.  God is mercifully patient with us (2 Peter 8-10, where Pastor Mike read last night; Romans 2:4), giving us plenty of time to turn this thing around and repent. But we're the blind leading the blind, and too many of us are falling into the pit (Matt 15:14). Darkness was allowed to stay - light didn't shine somewhere along the line, and we got used to the shadows.Would someone turn on the lights? Would someone be bold enough to play by the rules, to learn from the Master how to really live in the kingdom? There's no room for wishy-washy Christians any more. If it's going to be real, then we'll have to be real.  Practically, what does this mean? We need to BE more, not just DO more, or TRY more. Instead of thinking "I need to pray more" - just pray more. Instead of thinking "I need to study my Bible" - just do it. Instead of asking "why am I not sharing Jesus with folks?" - just talk Him up. For me, living it out is a whole lot more fruitful than thinking about it or having guilt over a lack of it. I want to BE a person who does those things - not someone trying to live up to a standard, but who's living life through the standard...  I'm through preaching now :)

      I'm on a really convicting chapter in  urlLink ENJOYING GOD , the book I've been trying to finish this week. Reading at lunch this afternoon, SJ Hill puts something to words that we "know" but don't do very well. We'll never overcome sin by hating sin - the starting point is to be exceedingly satisfied with God. Everything else is counterfeit. I think he quoted John Piper: "Sin is what we do when we're no longer satisfied with God." Wow.  I haven't been like that, and I haven't helped anyone else in that area either. As "head of household" in my family, I'm constantly voting God out (sorry for the BB4 reference!). Or at least I'm putting Him up against something else and then we vote together. Whatever it is, my belief that "I love God" needs to be lived out in reality. Finances. Family. Time management. Work. Ministry.... Wow.  I'm encouraged by that, more than being guilted down in my conscience. I want to finish the book so my wife can take it with her on vacation next week. She's been reading Rick Warren's  urlLink THE PURPOSE DRIVEN LIFE ; some of the practicalities in there are good, but this book has the basis for all that: love God more than anything else.  One more thing. He's wrapping up my current chapter with this thought: God wants us to succeed. He tests us for APPROVAL, not for FAILURE. He doesn't dwell on my defeats, only on my victories in Him as I seek to be like Him and satisfied in Him... Wow.

      I'm not real big on email devotionals - most of them leave me thirsty for more. But I discovered  urlLink this one , and today's really says something meaningful:  10/15/03  A Vivid and Separate Thing  Betsy Childs   .... Have you fallen into thinking of virtue as the mere absence of vice?  I have, on more than one occasion.  I once led a Bible study on the subject of pride, and one of the participants asked if we were going to also study humility.  "Oh, no," I responded, "If you can conquer pride, you've achieved humility."  However, more study and a few more years of battling my own pride convinced me that I was dead wrong on this issue.  It is only by pursuing the positive fruit of humility that we can ever hope to battle pride.  Humility is not the mere absence of pride any more than white is the absence of color.  Humility is a "vivid and separate thing," a prize worth pursuing.  It is only when we learn through humility to think on things greater than ourselves that we will be able to abandon our pride.   C. S. Lewis noted a similar misconception in his sermon "The Weight of Glory."  Lewis writes, "If you asked twenty good men today what they thought the highest of the virtues, nineteen of them would reply, Unselfishness.  But if you had asked almost any of the great Christians of old, he would have replied, Love.  You see what has happened? A negative term has been substituted for a positive&#8230;."    We should be careful to avoid substituting negatives for positives.  When God commanded his people to be holy, He did not base his command first and foremost on the detestability of sin.  He grounded this command in his own character, saying "You shall be holy because I am holy."  Yes, God hates and abhors what is unholy, but this abhorrence springs from his delight in what is good and true, namely Himself.  Like Him, we should not look at the joyful pursuit of holiness as the wearisome extermination of vice.  We should not merely hate what is evil; we should also cling to what is good.  In doing so, we move from the defensive to the offensive, a move that is a major turning point in the winning of any war.

       urlLink CNN.com - Woman opens fire at church, killing her mother, pastor and herself - Oct. 6, 2003   The thought that struck me as I read this article? "I wonder what was in his sermon notes?" The pastor had just finished teaching Sunday School - what had he taught? - and was preparing to worship and preach. And I wonder to myself: what would I want to teach in the moments before I die? What would I want my final sermon to be, my final discussion, my last email, my last blog post?  And how can I know if this is it?

       For this reason, ever since I heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints, I have not stopped giving thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers.  - Ephesians 1:15-16   What am I thankful for? This week, I'm more thankful than I've been in a long time for a long weekend. No kidding - it's been a long few months at work, at church and at home, and having a five-day break from work and church, spending that time at home for the most part - aaaaahh. It's wonderful.  When we think of being thankful, we of course think of family - my wife and children, my 'rents and in-laws, my brother and his wife, extended family and friends. We think of our church - Pastor and his extended family, good friends who've been ministering together for years, new faces getting excited about life in Christ. We think of our nation, where we hope to stand for truth, for peace and for Jesus in the midst of cultural intrusions. And we think of Jesus - thankful for salvation, for grace, for healing and comfort.  But what else are we thankful for? Real thanksgiving, I'm coming to find, is all-inclusive. I'm not really thankful unless I also appreciate troubles in my life. Storms and trials have popped up, tools of testing in my life; and I'm thankful that God sees fit to test me, sees fit to show me where I'm at in this journey. It's not about passing or failing. It's about moving forward, growing in Christ-likeness. I'm thankful that there's more to salvation than just being saved from hell. I'm grateful for having something to live for now, not just something to die for later.  Thanks for reading.

      Whew!!! I passed my mid-term in Bible College. Oh yeah, I forgot to mention in my last blog that I take a class in evangelism at my church's bible college. I was so excited to find out that I passed the test. I missed 3 of the 5 classes and wasn't able to really get a lot of notes from anyone, although the ones I did get were helpful.   For class last night, we headed to an area in town called 5-points (basically the college party central of Columbia) to witness. We had a great time to be able to be a "light" for the Kingdom. Pastor Rick, Pastor Jones and myself were sitting by the fountain in the center of 5-points when a couple came up to us for directions to the "coolest club" in town. Pastor Rick, in his suave voice, said, "We're actually telling people about Jesus." The reaction of the couple was classic. With a gasp of air and a "two-step" shuffle back, the man said, "Woah!!! Ring! Ring! Ring! That's are cue to leave." The woman was pretty buzzed up, but she wanted to indulge in a conversation about "self-spirituality" with us. She said that they believe that they are able to set God's standard (paraphrased) for "spirituality." She kept repeating to us that she was the "most spiritual" person we will ever meet.   The gentleman said to us that God will not judge him based what he has done wrong, but by what he does good. (that's trying to obtain righteousness through works...it will never happen) I asked him, "If you faced a judge, here on earth, that was trying you for murder, would he be just in letting you go free because you've been a good guy until you killed somebody?" "No, of course not," he said, "I killed somebody!" Then I said, "How will God, who is just, be able to let you into heaven by turning his back on his own requirements?" The reaction that followed is the norm, "Uumm, um." Our time was cut of when the woman was asking us to kiss her.   We prayed that the seed we sowed will be watered and harvested by more "laborers." Till then, we work for the Kingdom!!! :)   - Carlos

      It's Christmas time, in case you were wondering what all the hoopla was. This is the time of year when it's, mostly, politically correct to celebrate Jesus in the open cultural marketplace. That is, as long as we recognize other folks' belief systems and don't do anything exclusivistically to condemn the people looking at our nativity scenes. There are stories each night on the news of a needy family getting help to "make it a good christmas for the kids this year". And there are stories on TV of how christmas will be cancelled when Santa's taken out, or when all the toys run out and presents can't be delivered.  All that to say: we just don't get it.  I'm trying to get it, but I know I don't. I say that in all humility - I have no idea how far Jesus stooped to become "one of us". We talk about how lowly He became, as a baby in a stinky cave/stable. But even if He'd been born to Caesar, it would've been an infinitely huge drop from the thronerooms of Heaven. So I'm not stuck on "the Baby", as much as I want to simply dwell on Him, why He came, how He brought glory & honor to the Father, how He models that for us and graces us to do the same.  Merry Christmas.

       This was posted to the  urlLink 1J13 Email list  from Dawn, 12/12/03 - thoughts that make you think:   The other day, flipping radio stations in the car, I caught a line from a Christmas carol, I can't even place which one.  But the bit I heard was "... in lonely exile here. The Son of God appear.  Rejoice, Rejoice, Emmanuel. Has come to ransom Israel."  The words, "In lonely exile here," have just gotten stuck in my mind. It's the thing that doesn't fit in to our mammoth December celebration.  (Remember, mine started in November because I couldn't pack it all into my December.)  Christmas is the biggest, most hyped holiday by far.  We get two weeks out of school, it's ok to indulge  - in food and beverage, entertainment, overspending. And we start closer and closer to the fourth of July every year.  It's the mac-daddy of celebrations every year. And rightly so, because we were so desperately in need of a Savior to redeem us. And we definitely have cause to celebrate the resolution of that major crisis. (Breathe a heavy sigh of relief.)  But do you see what is happening?  "I" had a need.  "I" couldn't meet it.  "I" finally got it.  "I" am now safe.  "I" can now celebrate my windfall.  It's still so sadly about me.   What is Christmas from God's perspective?  The beginning of a terrible experience of exile in a foreign and wicked land that culminates with the ultimate pain, suffering and death. Separation from the glory and splendor of Heaven (which is all he has known).  Limitation to an earthly body, complete with all the limitations of a newborn, like not even being able to lift his own head.   It makes me want to spend more time on my knees, and less on the decorations this Christmas.  It makes me want to fast and pray, not cook Christmas dinner.  Love for my Lord is causing me to grieve this festive holiday season for His loss, His suffering, His exile rather than celebrate my own good fortune at His expense.

      I received a sermon in my email inbox from John Piper @   urlLink desiringGod.org   that deals with the question of making decisions as a church body, needing to take votes, needing 100% unanimity, etc. Sometimes when a decision is made, the congregation can feel left out, put out, or put upon - and our democratic egos get bruised because we not only disgree, but we were also not consulted, and now we don't really have a say in the matter. He is one of my favorite speakers; I love anyone who makes me stop and go hmmmmmm... and this case is no exception. There are changes coming at CWO, and if I'm really on board with what God's doing at the church, what am I to do if I don't agree with the decisions being made?  Piper shares an interesting thought in this paragraph:  "I would go to  urlLink Philippians 3 . Here Paul would like for them to come to one mind (as he often pleads), but he does not envision an inability to continue working together until that unanimity happens. He says, &#8220;I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. Only let us hold true to what we have attained&#8221; (3:14 -16). This strikes me as amazingly realistic. There are some people who are not yet persuaded. If they took a vote now, there would be differences. But Paul does not talk in either-or terms for the fellowship. He sees process and movement. There is no reason to think the whole church is paralyzed till the minority arrives at agreement. That can even happen after a vote that they disagreed on. "   I have always considered those lines to come from Paul-who-knew-better to those-who-didn't that "if you don't agree with me, fine - God can show you I'm right". I'd seen it with a certain amount of arrogance and cockiness, maybe a remnant of his Pharisee days; but also with a confidence that God was showing Him something important right now, take his word for it, ask God to show you the same thing. But the new twist I'm seeing is that Paul is more concerned about moving now in God's purposes, and allowing Him to move in the hearts of others without being held back now.  There's a thought in Brian McLaren's  urlLink FINDING FAITH  that fits here: If I don't agree with something that might in fact be right, I have the option of "jumping in" and feeling it out from the inside, rather than just poking holes from the outside about why I think it's wrong. That's a huge leap of faith for me most of the time, probably for most people. But if you trust your leaders, and trust God in leading them - then why shouldn't they be given the benefit of any of my doubts? Why can't I jump in and let God prove that it's wrong? More often than not, I find that my own understanding was limited and wrong, while the vision ahead of the pastor or other leader was in the direction of God's plans for us at the time.  Just thinking out loud. Real humility recognizes that God's got something going on, that He's undertaking it and we're just along for the ride, and that with the Spirit's discernment we can join in the effort and stop kicking against the goads.

      This has been... a week. Hasn't it? Even with my wife and kids getting a holiday Monday, we all feel run down and worn out from how long, how stress-filled, how absolutely nutty this week has been. "Challenging" is the first descriptive word that comes to mind; "convicting" is the second one. I've been watching people, reading some stuff, listening for God to speak - and I've been pricked: things need to change.  You've probably felt some of that, too. I know I'm not alone. I was moving garbage to the curbside this morning (I hope the pesky raccoon that ripped into our last trashbag and licked all the leftover bowls of chili from Tuesday night is running around the woods with a tummy ache and the runs today!!!), and I shouted good morning to our neighbor, Ray. We both agreed - short weeks just mean that five days worth of work has to be done in four. Same kind of week for him, probably for you, too.  So here we are at the threshold of another weekend. I'm looking forward to not having to do much of anything tomorrow - but I also know I'll be busy with something, anything that might need to be done. Groceries, chores, putting new light bulbs in, cleaning the playroom, shopping for someone's birthday present so our daughter can go to the skate party Sunday afternoon, basketball game tonight.  Life is full. It is abundantly full. And yet, I don't think this is necessarily what Jesus had in mind: "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, and have it to the full" ( urlLink John 10:10 ).   We live an "abundant life" that is really stealing, killing and destroying us. Instead of resting in what Christ is actually promising here, we get over-busy, over-spent, over-stretched in our responsibilities, activities, even church things. That's not the "abundant life"; that's not "life to the full."  The challenge, the conviction for me this week - maybe for you, too - is to just be what God has called me to be: Christ-like. Difficult enough, but totally available in His grace, right? Anything else is graceless, because most of what I find myself involved in apart from that calling is full of my own will-power and determination, not His empowering and enabling grace.  Maybe it's just me.

      I'm getting ready for this weekend's second study on "humility" in our LifeTraining class Sunday morning. Where we talked about some of the benefits, blessings and promises attached to real humility last week, this week we're going to focus in on Pride - and how in the heck we think we don't have any. I'm going to write/teach from a first-person perspective as much as I can - it's the only perspective I've got, and I see enough of this in me to not really have to worry about anyone else's pride issues ( urlLink Luke 6:41-42 ).  When I look for pride in me, these are some of the things I begin to notice: * I think I know it all. Maybe I'm not that bold, but I usually think I've got The Answer to whatever question comes my way. If I don't have The Answer, I'm usually pretty sure that My Opinion is better than yours. * I don't like talking with dogmatic people. If you're not open to discussion, I'm not usually open to listen. Why? Because my ideas are better than yours, and I'm kinda put off that you would think otherwise. * In my humility, I know The Answer, but I also know (rather smugly) that you need to discover it for yourself. So I'll be quiet, appearing (even to myself) to be quite humble, but inwardly knowing you'll never get it... at least not as much as I get it. * When I think about my own humility, I'm usually pretty proud if it. When I think about my pride, I usually get mad at God before realizing it's me. * I think I know what's best, when it usually comes out that I didn't have a clue.  We don't have a clue most of the time, and yet our minds swell thinking that we have all The Answers. Pride is so quick to rise up and bite us in the rear, and as it's puffing us up, it's also sucking the life out of us.  I'll write more later this weekend. Any other thoughts out there? Anything's helpful in fleshing this out for me - getting it to the bible study is secondary to living it out in my own life.

       Look After One Another Hermas   Listen to me now: stand together in peace. Look after one another, and show concern for another's needs. By eating too much, some of you have brought sickness on your bodies and ruined them, while the limbs of others, who have nothing to eat, waste away for lack of food. And you who have become old in spirit: you are already dying. Your soft living and constant doubts have brought you to this point. You are enervated by the affairs of daily life; you have fallen into lethargy; you are like old men who have given up hope of regaining strength and expect nothing but to fall asleep. But don't give up hope. Awake and repent, and you will all be quite new again.  [from the Daily Dig, 01/12/2004, http://bruderhof.com/us/Subscribe.htm?source=DailyDig]  ====  Ouch. Yes, I'm a big guy, and I've eaten my share, so the physical challenge is very real. But that next line, that we who've been in the faith for a long while have fallen into a trap of "soft living and constant doubts", paying closer attention to the "affairs of daily life". There is such a hope in this: "Awake and repent, and you will all be quite new again."  Who doesn't want new strength? new vision? new mercies every morning? Who doesn't want to throw away the old mindsets? the old worthless things? No matter how comfortable, the worthless things won't get us any closer to the goal of Christ formed in us. "Awake and repent" - we need to wake up and smell the coffee, repent and enjoy the newness that we've left behind.  How do I know this is speaking to me? I've asked myself: what determines the course of my days? And I answer: my daytimer, my kids' school schedules, basketball practice, tumbling class, bedtime routines, morning routines, half-hour commutes, etc etc etc. In the midst of all that, I look for time with God, and He's always there, much more faithful than me. But what if I lived there, in the kingdom, more constantly in His presence, and then tried to find time for this day's schedule from withing my time with Him - instead of the other way around?

       This was in my inbox just before the christmas holidays. I was struck by how spot on it was: we usually have thoughts of worship and praise and the grace of God, but they often do not translate into any real life-transformations:    12/17/03  When Theology Becomes Doxology  Jill Carattini     More than six hundred years ago, a young Italian laywoman brought to a dark world a quiet but reverberating voice.  Catherine of Siena, as she is remembered, lived within a century marked by insecurity and fear, war and economic distress, terrifying disease, and corruption within the Church. Yet, her short life was one marked by a passion for the truth, intense care for humanity, and a fervent life of prayer.  Administering care at the bedsides of plague victims, writing letters to feuding church leaders, she emphatically declared in word and deed, "The way has been made.  It is the doctrine of Christ crucified.  Whoever walks along this way&#8230; reaches the most perfect light." (Footnote 1: Mary O&rsquo;Driscoll, Ed., Catherine of Siena (New City Press: Hype Park, NY, 1993), 13.) Not surprisingly, Catherine is best remembered as a compassionate intercessor, for she prayed with the same intensity with which she lived.  "O eternal God&#8230; I have nothing to give except what you have given me, so take my heart and squeeze it out over the face of the Bride." (Footnote 2: Ibid, 11.)  In the frailty of her own life, which was racked with great illness and sorrow, Catherine&rsquo;s severe desire was that God would take her life as an offering, using her in whatever way to mend the vast brokenness all around her.     Reading through a book of her collected prayers and letters recently, I was struck by a phrase the editor used to describe Catherine of Siena in prayer.  In her prayers, the editor notes, "her theology becomes doxology."  The statement is certainly rich with thought.  What Catherine believed to be true about God became in her prayers&#8212;and arguably in her life&#8212;an expression of praise to God.           But think about this.  Shouldn&rsquo;t all of our theology naturally lead us to doxology?  That is, shouldn&rsquo;t our understanding of God and of God's relation to the world naturally become expressions of praise to God? ====  Copyright(c) 2003 Ravi Zacharias International Ministries (RZIM).

      Happy 2004, y'all. We had a really good morning of worship and teaching this morning, with Pastor continuing his series on "HE IS ABLE." We looked a Melchizedek in  urlLink Hebrews 7  - a High Priest for Abraham, above and beyond the Levitical priesthood installed later with Moses. Jesus is the High Priest now, perfect in every way, able to save completely all who come to the Father through Him.  Personally, I feel God calling me to a mediation on " urlLink humilty ." And what I'm getting from my emphasis on humility partnered with "He is able" is the notion that where He is able, I'm not. There's nothing in me that's worth anything, nothing that's effective for any kingdom good, nothing that's sold-out holy apart from Christ. Maybe that's where we miss it, thinking that we actually bring something to this task. But there's nothing in me that started in me that will be of any use to God. I can say my "willingness" is useful, but even that attitude would have to be empowered by His grace. Again, nothing that comes from me will last.  Humility is seeing that and embracing that, on some level at least.

      But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions--it is by grace you have been saved. And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus, in order that in the coming ages he might show the incomparable riches of his grace, expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. -  urlLink Ephesians 2:4-7  NIV  Not only did Jesus die for our sins while we were sinners, He also saw fit to raise us up and seat us in heavenly places. Many of us might forgive, but we rarely forget to the point where that transgression won't effect our future dealing with that person. But very very few of us forgive on such a level where we now lift up the other person. Very very few forgive while being sinned against, before the other person even knows what's happened. Very very few of us ever reconcile and restore those broken relationships on that level, seeking to now bring "incomparable riches" upon the people who've done us wrong.

       urlLink Urban Legends Reference Pages: Inboxer Rebellion (Petition to Ban Religious Broadcasting)   I got this in my email inbox today, asking me to e-sign a petition to make sure the FCC wouldn't take religious broadcasting off the air. It's a hoax. There is no such legislation. If anything, the popularity of God as a cultural and financial commodity at this point in our country would probably be enough to thwart any attempts to remove the gospel from broadcasting.  I see a twofold point here. One, we as Christians are so gullible sometimes, open to "persecution", real or perceived, and we're so quick to take up arms and fight with our fellow Christians to withstand the onslaught of injustice. Even though it's not real, this letter will make its way around the globe, and we'll end up fighting a non-existent enemy while the real threats go unnoticed and un-threatened by us.  Second, we tend to fight persecution, when Jesus spoke more about loving our enemies, walking an extra mile, turning our cheek, "forgive them because they don't know what they're doing". Why are we so quick to protect our rights, to take offense when we perceive (it's not real here) that we're being put upon?

      This is just a reminder to anyone in Columbia who enjoys movies - or wants to know more about Jesus. We're going to be screening THE GOSPEL OF JOHN this Good Friday 04/09 @ 6:30pm on the CWO grounds. Please dress comfortably - we're going to be outside, literally showing it to the community and any passers-by.  What's good about the timing of this film's release is that it tells the whole story, providing alot of the background necessary to move into Mel Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST. While that movie deals almost exclusively with the last twelve hours on that last Friday (and the first few seconds the following Sunday - woo hoo), this one covers the entire Gospel of John, word for word.  Tell your friends and family. Shoot, bring your enemies if you can. Look forward to seeing everyone there.

         urlLink The Beatitudes - Kurt Vonnegut   For some reason, the most vocal Christians among us never mention the Beatitudes. But, often with tears in their eyes, they demand that the Ten Commandments be posted in public buildings. And of course that?s Moses, not Jesus. I haven?t heard one of them demand that the Sermon on the Mount, the Beatitudes, be posted anywhere.  "Blessed are the merciful" in a courtroom? "Blessed are the peacemakers" in the Pentagon? Give me a break!  He's got a point - while we need to be quick to point out our common transgression of God's law, don't we also need to point to Jesus' description of kingdom-living in a way that encourages and challenges us, too.

       Ethics - Dietrich Bonhoeffer   The great masquerade of evil muddles every  concept of ethics. Evil appears in the form of light, as good works--even as an historical necessity--or as justice, and utterly confuses one who comes from the traditional world of ethical ideas. For the Christian who lives by the Bible, however, these forms of evil simply confirm its abysmal wickedness. Who is able to withstand this evil? Only he to whom the last measure is not his own reason, his principles, his freedom or even his conscience -- but rather his readiness to sacrifice all of these: only he who is called to deeds of obedience and responsibility in faith and single-minded communion with God; only he who will let his life become nothing, as answer to God's request or call.

       urlLink ConcernedMembers.com   Who's making money off of this?!? While there might indeed be some shady dealings and underhanded stuff going on in the deacon boardrooms of our churches, to now profit (there's ad space, so somebody's making some $$$) from the angst and agitation of people who probably don't have a clue in the first place is on the immoral side of things. I might have problems with how some things are presented, with some new methods being introduced. But to feed the fire of disunity by promoting a website for bickering and namecalling - that's just wrong.  And hilarious. Read through some of the postings to the message boards... I'm still trying to figure out if it's satire or not.

      There is something to be said for going to church every week. No one else in the house is up right now. I'm making coffee, typing here, getting ready to make copies of the bulletin and get a new laptop loaded with the software that'll (prayerfully & hopefully) make our service run smoothly. And I'm really looking forward to going to church.  There are blog entries all over the 'osphere concerned with not going to church, it's ok to not do church, it's beneficial to do something different. I'm not writing against them - it's just that actualy going to church is usually given the short end of the cultural church stick. As long as you're seeking after "Christ in community", however that's defined for you right now, that's cool. For me, it's come to mean gathering together with my church family a few times each week. If anything, we might need to meet together more - able to encourage each other more, play together more, worship together more, grow together more.
