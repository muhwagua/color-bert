      Mr X called...so unexpected!  I thought I was in for a looong wait...but he had left a message on my voicemail that I got this morning.  So, of course, I held off until mid-morning and then returned the phone call--can't seem to excited...he said that I took him off guard with the last conversation and he hadn't really known what to say.  He said it kinda freaked him out...okay, I couldn't bring myself to ask what it was that freaked him out--not really sure, but I think he read way too much into my thoughts and questions...  He feels that I need to realize that I am remembering the past and that so much has changed since then...but no matter what, I need to let go of the past because that will never be.  He also said that he wished he could help me figure out why I wasn't happy because that is what he wished for me...that was sweet.  He said that he will support me no matter what I do but that I really need to take some time to think everything through...he wants me to be sure that I do it for me and not out of spite or emotions.  Ah, what age has done for Mr Xs maturity!  Of course, I had to call my voice of reality...she laughed and said it really did sound like we had role-reversed...haha, what a crack-up, my dear!    I think I need some time to digest everything...afterall, the big move is coming up and that is sure to bring so more emotions to the surface...

      The comments didn't work...oh well...  Awesome weekend...I went to see my roommate in Chi-town...she shipped off her hubby and bubs so we had the night to ourselves...IKEA here we come!!! We tried to remember that our husbands would kill us if we brought home one of everything:)  We had a rip-roaring time at Houlihan's and then went to find the nearest tattoo parlor...the funny thing was, there was some SHADY business next door...hmm....not drawing any conclusions but what do you think with lots of doors and an ATM??? Of course, I had to use the bathroom as soon as we get there...the place smelled HIDEOUS!!! But, using their restroom was worse then squatting against a tree in the African Rainforest...I felt seriously violated and thank god I had spare kleenex--hello, toilet paper!  It was just like old times...we even watched our party videos...boy, were we off the hook back then!!! A little embarassing but mostly just HALARIOUS!  It was great re-visiting Tow-truck Mike, Joe, John...George--I mean Kevin...sigma-kappa...and Kelly...  Hubby was a downer when I got home...he was CRABBY...so we had a huge blowout...ah, wonderful way to cap off the weekend!  I talked to Mr X again Sunday night...it was funny calling because I had wanted to suggest we see each other at some point but didn't have the balls.  So I was just like "um, yeah, hi, uh-hu"--DORK!!!  I think it made him crack up though:)  Just talked about what's new and then got into a deep discussion on happiness and to what extent someone is free to chase it down...but his phone kept cutting out and I was sick of calling back...so I didn't.  But I KNOW he has my phone number...he said he had lost it before--uh-huh, sure--so I gave it to him AGAIN...let's see if he ever actually calls...still holding out for my bd.

      Sorry I didn't have time to actually write something of substance yesterday...however, I thought I should spend a little time working since that is what they pay me for... although, today, I get to be here for longer...so I can goof for longer!!!  Okay...what has been making my brain do crunches...I talked to Mr X about three-four weeks ago...for a LONG time.  It was very nice actually...however, since then, I have an undying urge to call him again.  I did call back once to let him know the (fake) reason for my original call was now void due to an unforeseen (also, fake!) emergency...ah, revisiting the jr high days can be so freeing!... alas, X was not home and I was only able to communicate with the answering machine.  I was hoping I would receive a return call just to say--hey, I really enjoyed talking with you...I've missed you and I wish you well...  Now, I am holding onto the hope that I will receive a message for the dreaded "B" that is rapidly approaching...  Time to psychoanalyze....I have come to the conclusion that I am mortified of commitment...rather humorous looking the commitment level in my life I know...  But I have a tendency to get myself WAY over my head (with commitments) and then start pushing them all away...so, is this another passive aggressive way to kill-off my current commitments?  I mean, come on!!! I used to think the separation from Mr X was the one SANE thing I did in my life...and now, I keep wondering how to wiggle back into his...

      Okay...I am a little nervous about the information that will be divulged...therefore, we need to have some ground rules...  #1 NO QUESTIONS...take this blog for what it's worth...a peek into my psyche...if you have a burning need to ask a question, you may forward to my people and they will get back with your people if I choose to respond...  #2 DO NOT DIVULGE THIS INFORMATION...this will result in termination of the blog and you will have to spend the rest of your life wondering the end of this story...  #3 Okay, I don't have a number three but I remember learning all effective speakers have three main points...  Finally, for a lot of you this will not make ANY sense...for some, it will make just a little sense...for others, it will make a WHOLE lot of sense...and the rest will be scared.  I am going to start where I think the story needs to start...however, I will jump backward and forward, and repeat as well...but I promise, we can get through this and if nothing else, you will leave entertained and thankful that the edge I write from is not yours...

      Okay...a guy I used to work with sent me this...I thought it was pretty cool--thanks, Dirk!   BITCHDOM   When I stand up for myself and my beliefs, they call me a bitch.  When I stand up for those I love, they call me a bitch.  When I speak my mind, think my own thoughts or do things my own way,    they call me a bitch.   Being a bitch means I won't compromise what's in my heart.  It means I live my life MY way.  It means I won't allow anyone to step on me.  When I refuse to tolerate injustice and speak against it, I    .  am defined as a bitch.   The same thing happens when I take time for myself instead of being  everyone's maid, or when I act a little selfish. It means I have the courage and  strength to allow myself to be who I truly am and won't become anyone else's idea   of what they think I "should" be.   I am outspoken, opinionated and determined.  I want what I want and there is nothing wrong with that!  So try to stomp on me, try to douse my inner flame, try to squash every  ounce of  beauty I hold within me.  You won't succeed.  And if that makes me a   bitch, so be it. I embrace the title and am proud to bear it.        B - Babe       I - In      T - Total       C - Control of       H - Herself        B = Beautiful       I = Intelligent       T = Talented       C = Charming       H = Hell of a Woman        B = Beautiful       I = Individual       T = That       C = Can       H = Handle anything

      Whew! what a weekend...and not in a good way...  My "voice of reason" called...I told her my decision about not calling Mr. X again...I told her I came to realize it would be the same old thing and no point...and she says "so basically you just wanted to make sure he still wants you and then ditch him..." ah...no!  I needed to finally feel closure on a very tumoltuous time in my life and talking about it with him was the last resort...I have been through YEARS of therapy and nothing ever closed that door and I finally feel that it is slowly starting to swing shut...ugh! whatever!  Scott and I actually had a pretty good weekend...we worked together all day Saturday to get the rest of our stuff organized and did a HUMONGO cleaning...I cleaned our little bathroom for an hour and a half!!! I found some nasty scum that I will spare you the details about...but it made me want to heave!  Ah...then the infamous Sunday...thinking I was a good dooby going to dinner at the parents to spend some quality time with my sis that never keeps in touch...and my matriarch decides this would be a good day for an all-out attack...apparently, my sis mirrors the other picture of perfection in the fam and spilled some beans found out to my parents about the other sis that mirrors my picture of total and utter imperfection...so, of course, my mom thinks that I am to blame...I am the original black sheep, you know...and heaven forbid, this sis could actually be making decisions on her own...NO...it is MY fault because I tried to look out for them and teach them things about the world that my parents would like to naively believe would never be experienced--except that now that I have talked with them about it, they are destined to experiment--because they would have never come across it otherwise!  Ahhh...then, mommy-dearest decides to start in about our past...to which I must have started to flip out because Scott was trying to corral me into a different room...not that I would have attacked her, but it did cross my mind...  Okay...first of all, my parents can never quite make up their minds what they think should be done...it is basically up to the whim of my mother's emotions, which change constantly...  Secondly, let's move on!  I didn't go through all of this therapy to be pushed right back where I was...I am an ADULT...and, quite frankly, I can talk to my sister's about anything I DAMN PLEASE!!!  I don't want them driving drunk, or being taken advantage of, and never having taken the opportunity to discuss these things with them...that would be guilt...not my mum trying to blame what she sees as evil on me...always looking for someone else, never looking within...  Thirdly, my sis does need to realize things about life...but I am living proof that having someone breathing fire down your back is swimming against the current...it can't happen until she is allowed to explore herself.  I feel bad for her because she was caught in the crossfire...and part of it was about her and alot of it wasn't...  Mum did come back and apologize--and after they revived me, her and my dad said how much they wanted to talk with me about what I "went through" so that they could understand...and to that I said, like hell!!!  Please...really, guys, I love you, I forgave you, but you can't slap me and call me stupid anymore!!!  For YEARS, I wanted to explain this to them and make them see...if for no other reason than to prevent it from re-occurring with my sisters, which it has...but the don't want to know...they want to believe they have had no part.  And that's their choice, but I don't need to put myself back in the place of being rejected and ridiculed...  So, for now, i will keep my sis in my thoughts and prayers...I know that I was delivered and I hope that she escapes with fewer scrapes and bruises than I did...

      Wow...I can't believe how long it has been...I guess that is what happens when your life isn't all that exciting so you don't feel a burning need to blog...however, after reading a few other blogs (the sis') I decided I should update mine too:)  Not much new has happened...I called Mr. X last week(?) nothing exciting...just to say hey and to see if he was done being freaked out.  I must have been in one of my "bitch can't stop me" moods because I asked him what it was that freaked him out.  He said that I had been talking about all these thoughts and that he just didn't want me to get over my head without being realistic...i laughed--hehe--how's that for a blow to the ego--and told him that I think he misunderstood what I had said and that I never meant to propose anything because that was FAR from where I was at...had I thought about it?  yeah...sadly, so...however, i may be f#@*ed up but I am not that far gone...well, after I said that he wanted to get off the phone and told me to call him any time...I said "please feel free to do the same" and left it at that...so, basically, I am going to leave it there...I came, I heard, and I walked away...I know what is there and I have to believe there was a reason I had walked away before and I need to release myself from that...whew...what a revelation!  Too bad I couldn't have come to that conclusion before I started down such an idiotic path!  I am just very thankful that in all of that I chose not to go the step further to see him...that would have been jumping right into the fire...  Hubby is still as clueless as ever...but I think that he is going to start trying with more vigor...my resolve is back to be the best little wifey and mommy I can be...I just need some excitement in my life...so maybe I will get that tatoo afterall:)  I did get my belly button pierced awhile back...I thought my bod was made for piercings because I have never had any problems with getting pierced but now my belly button is a little sore...so I've started back with the bactine...ouch!  it stings a little but I've seen the alternative...a friend with a piercing gone straight to hell and it looked as though her belly button and the rest of her stomach were going to fall off or be taken over by gangrene...  One of bf was supposed to come in from Kansas in February...never heard from him...I tried to call but his phone number is no longer valid....ehhhh...I keep wanting to call his bro and ask what's going on, but I chicken out...I don't want to be told that he forgot about me or that he didn't want to see me...so I guess I'll wait until I run smack dab into one of the fam...

      Okay..I forgot to copy and of course I timed out...so here's the recap!  It's been a while since I have been able to blog...we had the big move that took four days instead of the anticipated 2...and of course, there was the pre-move preparation--packing--YUCK!  But of course, my husband, who is oh so understanding, helped me with the packing...oh, wait, not MY husband...he would just keep looking around and say, what is it that needs to be packed...uh, HELLO!!! see this *@#! all over...all THAT needs to be packed...he just doesn't get it and continues to choose to be ignorant...and it is getting VERY old!  Which leads to his next blunder...remember the bday that was coming up that I was dreading so...thinking I had made this clear to him, made me believe that he wouldn't have the AUDACITY to forget...well, that part was true...however, he didn't make time to get me anything...yes, I know, you are thinking, what a jerk...but, please, don't be so kind!  Ass...big, fat, hairy, horse's ass, would be the correct way of stating it!  He said that he didn't have time...because, oh yeah i forgot, he worked SOOO hard on packing...whatever!!!  So, basically, not a whole lot of people remembered....our parents remembered...my older sister called and sang with the bro in law, but then said she forgot to mail my present...my other sister called the cell, but I didn't get it until this weekend...other sister is still mia...my best friend called that day, but forgot to say happy birthday!!!...my gram called to say she forgot to mail the card...the other grandparents I still haven't heard from...  Exactly why i HATE my birthday...

      I forgot a great part...he told me that he offered up a testicle for research...what a whacko!  He heard the company I work for was advertising the desire of testicles....for $35,000.  Yeah, right!!!  He called and they told him it wasn't true, duh!  He told me it was like me donating an egg...not!!!  I can re-generate an egg, last time I checked, you can't regenerate a testicle!!!!!!!!!!!

      lol...really hard!!!  Okay...I was wrong, he did call back, but since I leave early on Wednesdays, I missed his call again...so I called him and lm, and he called back...what do you say to a person you don't really know anymore and don't really care if you talk to?!  We talked for 20minutes about nothing...I have nothing to say!  What do I say...um, I was really screwed up and needed some closure so I could finally stop thinking about you...well, I got it and now I wish you would stop calling me?!  I don't know if I can tell him that.  And not because I want to stay in contact, but because I don't want to hurt his feelings AND I don't want to promote any psychoticness...he is all about that he has changed, and part of me wants to believe that, but the other part sure doesn't want to pay the penalty if I'm wrong!   Anyway...he went into how he kicked his girlfriend out of his apartment a few weeks ago...hmmm...no straight invitations, but it seemed like he was fishing!  No, no, no, and NO!!!  Wouldn't have done that when I was insane, definitely not now either!  He finally let me get off the phone, and said...I'll call you soon...and then said, wait maybe you should call me...I just said I'll talk to you later...  Can you tell I have absolutely nothing to do at work???  Ugh...it gets so boring to sit here for 9 hours and dink around.  There are only so many things I can look up on the internet!  Hey...I just got a work-related email...yeah--something to do!

      Wow...talk about closure complete!  So I haven't talked to or had the urge to talk to Mr X in almost a month...I actually was wondering yesterday what he thought of all of it... if he thought, damn, she did it to me again...roped me in to cut me loose.  Kinda felt bad...half-bad...for half- a second.    So how ironic that this morning I would come in to a message from Mr X asking me to call...so I did, no hard feelings, just no smooshy feelings either...he obviously wanted to talk but I had absolutely nothing to say...he told me he passed his test to be a truck driver so now he is looking for a new job...I almost busted out laughing...not that there is anything wrong with truck drivers...they deliver the goods that I buy...but, to have thought he was what I truly wanted and screwed up...whew, what a momentary lapse of sanity!  So we only talked for three minutes before he had to go...said he would call back later, won't be surprised if he doesn't...I didn't mean to be rude, but I am sure he can tell that I am not dazed by him any longer.  I love him for what he was and the lessons I learned because of "us" but that is about it...I would be willing to remain friends, but I really don't know if we would even be able to be friends...what do we have left in common?    Been trying to get the house deco done...my lovely hubby is probably ready to kill me...he always says non-chalantly, now, we probably should sit down to write out a list of priorities for the house so that we don't spend all our money on things that come lower on the list.  Translation:stop bringing this shit home that we don't really need...ah, but until he says just that, I spend away:)  This weekend I'm going to IKEA with my mom and sis...so I am dreading that pre-shopping lecture.  But, I am just going to have to forewarn him, the bill has the potential to be high, I'm sorry, but there isn't much I can do about it....why?  Because I can't just hop in my car and go to IKEA....and two, it is the cheapest place to get stuff!!!

      Never know quite how to start...so I will just jump right in:)  Been on the slim-fast diet for about 2weeks.  Now, you need to understand that I am really on the Sara-slim fast diet.  This means, I try like hell to stick to the regimen but sometimes eat when I'm not supposed to and sometimes binge.  Great idea, huh?!  I'm not doing that bad.  It just sucks on the weekend because hubby loves to eat, and then on the days we have lunch together, because I am supposed to have a shake for dinner, but who can do that after tasting real food???  But I am so happy, I have lost some weight already...I officially can fit into the next size down.  Occassionally I could pour myself into the smaller size, but I was in the middle.  Smaller size a little snug, bigger size a little big.  But I went clothes shopping and can totally fit into the small size--yeah!  On my weigh to my old self!  If I get to a 10 I will be happy, though I would love to get back to 8 since I have so many cute clothes from that era:)  I gave up on the 6...selling all that in my garage sale.  That wasn't natural anyway, and the others are much more attainable, in a healthy way!  We went to see the gram...she had to get hearing aids.  She was quite put-out that her "family" hadn't told her she wasn't hearing.  Her stepsons wife did.  Well, gram, to be honest, I just thought you were getting Quookie (okay, I had no idea how to spell that one)...and she is still considering moving here which would be great!  She gave us a generous gift and told me to spend it wisely--hmm...could she be reminiscing about the past???  I told her we would spend it on doing some home projects--yeah, my favorite!  So of course, we had to run out and buy a couch!!!  Now, you might think, hmmm...she bought a couch?  But you must realize.  I am the queen of thrift...I can't bring myself to pay alot of money for furniture...especially with a toddler--boy!  We demolished our last couch in under three years, so until I can get the B-meister to sit instead of climb (maybe by 20!) it will be thrifty furniture for me!  Anyway...we bought it at big lots--odd lots...wonderful name!  Anyway, I like it and it works with what I want to do my living room decor in:)   That's it for right now...I;m tired and have to start working at some point:)

      Wow...what a week and a half!!!  I got a call from an old friend...the type of friend that will always hold a special place in your heart, but isn't really a true friend.  I have known her for as long as I can remember...we basically grew up together.  She just doesn't know what it takes to be a good friend.  She will be there for you when it is convenient and when she is not busy with a boy.  It has caused a lot of pain and frustration but I know that people like that are truly the ones that lose.     Anyway, she called and left a message that she just HAD to talk to me.  So, of course, I assumed she was engaged (again) since this is really the only time she wants to talk to me...so I called back.  Boy, was I blown away!  No, she did not get engaged, she got married!!!  Okay, to say that I was shocked would be a major understatement!  All I could say was "wow, congratulations"...hmm... She told me that no she wasn't pregnant...she assumed that this is what I thought--not so!  I just didn't know what to say...I don't really even know him so I can be happy she is happy and pray that it lasts...  Then, I have been trying to get ahold of one of my best friends...his number was disconnected, so I called his brother.  Now, he was dating a girl who just had a baby--not his--and his brother thought it would be funny to tell me he had gotten married...please, my heart can't take it right now!  But no...he just up and went to TX.  Not sure why and not sure for how long.  His brother said he doesn't have a number to reach him...he didn't come back for his sister's wedding...kinda concerns me, that doesn't sound like him.  He was so excited to come for a visit...but hopefully he has email for when I get off my lazy bum and write:)  That's enough drama for now:)

      hmmm...so much for being back in a few!  I am beginning to think I have an anti-social personality disorder.  I don't like being around people!  I would much rather prefer to stay at home, relaxing by myself than to be around "friends"...and this is another issue, why is it that I always push away those that reciprocate friendship and draw near to those who suck the life out of me?!  I think that I don't want people to know "me" and so I only keep those around who minimally acknowledge my existence...why?  I hate to say this, but that is how my family has always been.  Not that I am jumping into the "I blame mom and dad for all my short-comings/problems" but I really don't think that they know who I am...quite honestly, they choose not to.  I can't tell you how many times I tried to let them in...desperately, but they can't handle it.  Ultimately, I feel like there is something morbidly wrong that causes people a) to not want to get to know me or b)to run as soon as they get a glimpse.  Therefore, I don't enjoy being hurt, so I keep those who would be kind at an arm's length distance and pull closer the ones that just use me anyway...  Case in point...my maid of honor.  Why?  That is all I can say!  She has never been and never will be a true friend, yet I continue to knock myself out for her.  After this shower, I'm done...not that I won't talk or do lunch with her, but I am done beyond that...  It just is kind of a bummer when I sit back and think of all the true friends I've shut out and the fact that I don't really have any in town.  One of my bf called to wish me a happy mother's day, I just started balling...she moved to IN and I miss her alot!  I never fully explained everything to her, but I never felt that it caused a growth defect in our friendship either.  When she left, I was VERY removed...in fact, I still haven't returned her call...I'm a bum...my other bf lives in TX...yeah, that's a hike!  But we have the best time on the phone, I just wish I could see her every once in a while!  anyway...enough wallowing in self-pity...  Not much else is new...the hubby about killed me because I spent $300-400 this weekend...I decided I was going to finish buying the "big" items for the house...and, oops, I forgot a couple things.  They will HAVE TO wait...I seriously think he will suffocate me in my sleep if I spend any more!  No Mr X...hmmm, wish I would have been the last to call, now I feel like an ass...

      Yeah...i've been procrastinating...  Okay...yesterday, I had to go to the "Project Engineering Admin" meeting...one word...BORING!!! Can we all feed more into the admin-bitch persona????  I just sat and looked around and said...uh, hell, no!!!  I will NOT do this for much longer.  Once the B-meister is in school, I will be doing something that feeds my soul, not something that is rapidly sucking my soul out of me!  Ugh...admins suck major dookie!  Stupid job, stupid power trips...personally, I hate admins...they always think higher of themselves than they are...like, come on, it doesn't take a genious to do what we do...we are basically white trash slaves...overworked, underpaid, and too stupid to do anything about it!  Not sure what I am going to do...I have been majorly fantasizing...I would love to do something artsy...but I am afraid it wouldn't be fun anymore...kinda like when I made all the Christmas presents and wanted to puke for the next 4months whenever I thought of doing anything crafty...  ahh...now that I have that off my chest...i did break down and call Mr X.  It was kinda weird...i used to think i had this premonition thing...whenever something huge was about to happen (usually bad) that I wouldn't have any way of knowing about...I would get these mini panic attacks...it was weird and freaked me out so I eventually stopped paying attention to those feelings...anyway, all that to say...B-meister and I were on our way to MI City to hit the Pfaltzgraff outlet when I had this insane feeling that I was about to run into Mike.  Which then got me thinking about what I would do...say...die of embarassment from the way I looked...you know, normal obsessions...after about five minutes, I was approaching the overpass by Benton Harbor and low and behold the Mr B's truck passed over it as I was going under...I about crapped my pants!!!  Needless to say, I had to call him the next day to see if it was him...he said nope, he was on his way to MI City!!!  WEIRD!!!  I still am kinda freaked out about it...  gotta take a break...be back in a few...

      I was having some very vivid, very real dreams...so I have been researching online the meaning of dreams...here is some of what I found:  Unconscious material attempting to make itself known, especially knowledge that you've feared. Look to the qualities of the intruder for more awareness about your fears. It may also represent aspects of yourself that you've denied  If the separation/divorce is an old one, the presence of the ex, especially in a positive way, may remind you that this is a quality you need to incorporate into your present life/relationship. The dream could be suggesting that what you learned from a previous relationship may need to be applied in a present one; that you're repeating the same mistake; that feelings/attitudes you have about an ex (especially as they apply to men/women in general) are being transferred onto a present relationship. What part of you is an "ex," or is some part of you being "x'd out"?

      Okay...back to epiphanes...and, no, i still don't know if i am spelling it correctly...  The other major shortage in my life was/is physical affection.  There were some things that happened in my mother's life, which she says totally effected the way she is able to show affection.  She said that she also went through a period when my older sis and i were young that she did not feel comfortable with my dad giving us an abundance of affection.  They were both so hands off I just have always figured i wasn't huggable turning into i wasn't loveable.  I guess that I have always had all the pieces but i have never been able to step back and put the puzzle together.  Meanwhile, as I was growing up, I was trying to get affirmation and affection from anywhere i could.  This leads me to another revelation.  At some point in our relationship, mr x and i began to have sex...and my understanding of when this happened and his understanding were two very different timetables.  This really freaked me out when he told me this...and i never really understood what it meant.  At one point, through all of my counseling, i wondered if i was raped...but i didn't really understand how i could have been and not known.  at this time, i really don't think that i was.  for one, mr x was not like that.  i mean he has his faults, and temper/rage was one of them but never did he force himself on me and it wasn't like we were drinking together--i never drank until i was almost 21--long after he was ditched!!!  i still don't think i completely understand what this means.  but i really wonder if i blocked out when we actually had sex.  My reasoning?  I truly, truly, truly wanted to be a virgin when i got married.  not because my parents said i had to be, but because for some reason i really believe this is the best way...and, trust me, now i know why it is--unfortunately, i learned the hard way...but anyway...i think that i was so starving for affection that this beautiful guy who was the only one who listened to me and wanted to be with me all the time was interested in ME that i wanted to be so close to the one person in my life who wanted to be that to me...i ate it up and let it go as far as it did.  i think eventually i came to terms with the fact i was 1)having sex and 2)liking the feeling of being close (and the horomones) that i was okay with the fact i just threw my morals out the window.  then i was having sex all the time.  it was hard though...having to lie.  i think that is the first time in my life that i blatantly was living a double life.  but i knew the consequences if my parents found out and i wasn't willing to deal...my god--they would have thrown me out, i'm sure!  my parents were always extremely hard on me...i don't know why me, but it makes me laugh, hurt, and get pissed all at the same time when i see how laxidazical (again...sp???) they are with my sisters...who of course, think they are harsh...but if they could have walked a day in my shoes!!!  i also think that when things did go sour that in my mind i blew them way out of proportion...now, there were some shady incidents with bodily force being used...and there was the stalking thing...but i don't really think that i was beat.  just misused.  again, not making excuses, there is no reason too...but i think mr x and i had an extremely volatile relationship...alot of which stemmed from the fact we were both so needy.  when it was good, it was awesome...when it was bad, it was hell...  i don't know why it has been so important for me to come to grips with these incidents, but they have been playing in my mind alot lately...i think that i just have a desire to come to terms with my past so that i can go on in the present.  i don't want to be a "victim"...so far, two HUGE pieces of the puzzle put together...i really don't think i will ever reconcile the school thing...that is one that is still painful and i think this causes me to put blinders on...i can't get past it...i can't remember what happened and that is so frustrating!  and i don't want to talk with my parents about it...  anyway...this really sounds a lot more depressing than it has felt.  it is such a huge relief to finally feel like i have some answers...it gives me back so many pieces of myself that i never really understood and didn't know where they were hiding...

      wow...just was sent a really cool site... check it out!  Interviewwithgod.net  I liked a lot of the phrases:  "You cannot make anyone love you~you can only learn to let yourself be loved..." "It is not enough to forgive one another but to forgive yourself" "There are many people out there who love you but have not learned how to show or express their feelings"

      Wow...what a rollercoaster week...  I have been reading an anger management book at the request of our counselor.  And reading that, coupled with some soul searching, I have had many epiphanes (sp?) this week...i have really begun to see my adolescent to adult years in a new light.  I never have been able to explain to people why I hate myself...what happened that made me feel so unloveable...why i am into self-destruction...and why i am so angry at my parents.  I just "knew" that i have never felt accepted or loved by them.  Even though I knew that they always told me that they loved me...its the emotional unavailability.  My parents don't want to go to a deep level when it is personal.  Sure, we talk about concepts, ideas, etc...which usually lead into arguments but we never talked seriously, cautiously about something that is effecting us on a personal level.  I was never able to open up to my parents for many reasons: judgement, punishment, and total avoidance.  Yep...that's my parents.  They can't accept that their kids might have faults without selfishishly turning the focus on themselves.  It always has to turn into...so you're saying i did something to cause this, etc...you know, sometimes you just want to be able to actually talk about what you are feeling without having to defend something that you may not even completely understand yourself!!! I think this is a huge reason why it has taken me so long to figure this out.  They have me feeling so guilty about being angry at them that I have never had the opportunity to figure out what i am/was angry about!  I have been too busy trying to forgive and forget, yet not completely understanding what it is that i am busting my ass to forgive and forget!    Whew...which led me to my next epiphane...i am so ultra sensitive to rejection, criticism, etc that i am really fucking up my marriage.  Not that I am taking complete blame for our problems...but if scott does not do everything perfectly i get either depressed or upset...or if he voices an opinion i take it as him telling me i'm not good enough and that i need to change.  umm...okay, in some circumstances that could be true, but freedom of speech was lost somewhere...so i wrote scott a long letter explaining what i was working through and apologizing.  i told him i am seriously committing to changing this about me and that i wanted to accept his faults and ultimately, accept myself.  he wanted to talk about it, but i'm really not ready to.  it still is pretty open and raw and dangerous.  i think that ever since i can remember people have had this preconceived idea of what they needed me to be for them and i have busted my ass to comply.  My parents needed me to get perfect grades and be the perfect christian and be the right amount of popular, participate in extra curricular, etc...and i did this for a large majority of my life.  my friends are the same way...even my mr x was like this...and whenever i would fulfill this need i have always felt like i am dropped.  it's not that anyone needs me as an individual, they need something from me, a shoulder to cry on, someone to fuck, a companion so that they aren't alone..etc.  i think that scott was the first person who saw all of my faults and actually let me be me...not that he didn't voice opinions but he has never tried to control me.  and to me, that is so abnormal that it has felt more like he didn't care then he is actually the one loving me unconditionally.  so as i am realizing this, i am realizing what a disaster my life is because of me trying to sabotage everything.  i really think that i was trying to get him to leave because i wouldn't do it...and now, to have a clean conscience and start anew...i am seriously considering telling him about mr x.  why? hmm..to make myself feel beter.  i feel guilty and it would help me "come clean"...however, is that the best thing to do?  maybe i should talk about it with my counselor.  egh!  talk about putting myself in front of the firing squad!  but, i don't want to hurt scott and i don't want to lie either.  who knows...i'll think about it but it makes me want to barf.  more later...

      ok...see 6/3/02...started to think I had made a complete ass of myself and i was determined NOT to call Mr X--yet still, I desperately wanted to the ball to stay in my court.  hahahaha...he called yesterday and now the ball is in my court:)  We talked for about 30minutes...not really about anything, I told him that we had gotten away for the weekend, etc and that was about it...nothing earth shattering, but definitely only a "friend" basis.  and that is truly all that I feel.  We talked about the "old" days...i told him how i had found a couple boxes of jr high/high school stuff at my parents and how halarious it was.  And it truly felt like I was talking to an old friend from the past and once we hung up it was over...no pining, no wondering...yippee!!!  And the best part is I will never call him again and I won't have been the last to call:)  anyway...b still has a temp but all else is fine...so I will take him to the dr tomorrow if he still has a temp but i really have no idea what it is from...  tt my bf...it was so awkward.  I don't really know why but i didn't feel comfortable talking to him and there were some definite barriers...could it be the lectures i was getting?  okay...when i said i had to watch my mouth because b mimics EVERYTHING  i meant i had to stop saying things like "crap" etc...the expletives have left my vocabulary a while ago, i'm not that stupid...ahh, another word that i need to stop using!  Anyway, got a two minute lecture about how if i can't say it in front of b, should i be saying it at all???  hmmm...its not that i can't say these things in front of him, however, i would prefer my son not to go around saying crap and stupid...thanks!  that was just one of several lectures and i sound more pissed (another one!) than i really am...just annoyed.  not at him, but at how the message was delivered...also sad that it seems we have gotten to a place we probably won't come back from and i'm not sure how or why we are there.  then my other bf...seems like she's avoiding...don't know if she is but everytime i talk to her she has to get off the phone suddenly but promises to call back...she usually does a few days later but still...i don't think we've had a good conversation in weeks...i think it is her whole mr x thing...she says there are absolutely no feelings toward him, only anger...but anger comes from hurt and hurt from openness...so it started from somewhere and maybe she has never had closure...her mr x got engaged and that has to be rough...i don't know how i would feel.  but she told me before that she had successfully stuffed those thoughts until we started talking again, so maybe i'm the link and she is trying to forget...i haven't even told her that i think i can come out this fall!!!  lots more to tell, but i have to work since i am leaving early today...

      ahhh....what a relaxing weekend.  We got up North and dropped b off at hubby's parents...then 2 whole days to ourselves.  I had reservations for a room with a two person jacuzzi...that was the first thing we did...we probably took 6 total...but it was so relaxing!  We did some crazy stuff, that I will spare you the details on...but it was like we were in college again:) Crazy!  We saw Spiderman and Star Wars...and went out to eat...we went to the bay for about 10minutes because we felt it was a must considering we were there!  We had wanted to go Saturday but it rained...  b got so sick Sunday night...he had a 104 degree temp and then later he started puking   gotta go Mr X just called!!!!!!!!!!

      wow...just when I was getting bummed out this week...i heard from my bf...(see 4/4/02 log).  wow, even though it was only two sentences, it made my day.  he is going to try to call tonight so that will probably make my week.  I have really missed talking to him, though i am very worried about the whole mr x thing...i don't know yet if i will tell him because he will be far from thrilled...he'll probably be mad, so i'll wait to see what is going on in his life to see if it is even important enough to discuss.  it's kinda funny how most of my friends are guys...i always thought that it was because i couldn't make girlfriends but guys are a lot less maintenance, plus they don't usually act catty like girls do.  i just don't think that i like to disclose much to others, so i think i only let in a few at a time.  the only problem with that is that when one relationship is on the rocks it knocks out about half of my support system...  okay...so a new admin started yesterday and i had the opportunity to help train.  she was asking me about different people (admins) and i went into this whole spiel about how i don't like to get caught up in the politics of offices...blah, blah, bla...so she says "i'm the same way!" and then rants for 10-15 min about who she does and doesn't like...how do you know after 1 day?!  ugh, admins are an incorrigible bunch of weirdos!    got some cute lingerie for the get-away...now i'm debating a bikini wax...ouch!  but it beats shaving...i wonder if a home waxing system would work.  i also picked up some comfy pj's and am considering any other fun gadgets...hmmm...not quite decided.  since the hubby isn't too into funky i figured the lingerie will be enough for him:)  that's all for now...toodles!

      whoa...didn't realize it had been so long!  still no Mr X...but now my stubborn side has kicked in and I am determined not to call again...bummer...not that I am still all "what if" about him...but sometimes it is nice to know you still appeal to other people, you know?  Especially when your hubby sucks at the affirmation part of life.  He is awesome with Brennan...he always affirms him... however, he seems to forget about me.  Now, understand, I don't ask for a lot...I have never been one to demand my guy to give me presents, have a fortune, extravagant anything...and, why???  Because I have always KNOWN that I am high maintenance as far as the affirmation stands.  I seriously go nuts if I don't get it.  I know that I am like a good 30lbs heavier...but I don't think I have completely gone to the dogs.  I have really been trying to keep better care of myself.  I had kinda forgotten (not really) about that...I think I was depressed and let myself go a little too far.  So, I have been trying to get back on track.  But I have realized a few things...1) if the person you knock yourself out for doesn't notice, what's the point?  2) because you knock yourself out and that person doesn't notice, it becomes more depressing and food looks more appealing.  which brings me to my other revelation...i'm an addict...not sure where it comes from, but I definitely am an addict...i am addicted to food and other things, but right now lets just talk about food.  i gorge myself all the time.  It is a serious struggle not to, which i don't know why i try to stop myself, because when i finally give in, an hour, a day, a week later it is a thousand times worse than if I just gave in originally.  i don't really think about anything while i do it...but i feel like shit afterwords.  i think i do it to deal with stress and to continue feeling like shit...if i didn't hate myself, where would i be?  it's kind of scary...like, everything else has miraculously come to some sort of order, but if i let go of this last demented thing, what will happen?  it's hard to explain...i don't think i even really understand it...i have such a distorted view of myself, the opinion changes constantly...  the thing that is humorous to me is that i used to be the opposite, i used to starve myself out of disgust...what the hell???  how on earth did i do that???  so i basically have only a few "hopes" as far as the weight loss goes...a) spastic colon kicks back into high gear...actually i need to go on a low fat diet to help that out...hmmm  b) i learn how to vomit more effectively...okay, i know that is disgusting.  however, it helped me get through some stressful times...i don't know why, and it grosses me out and my hubby (who unfortunately walked in on me doing it).  I was just aching so badly that wretching over the toilet took my mind off it.  ughh...now you know why i gross myself out.  whenever my mom talks about how she doesn't "get" why we do this to ourselves and how i "got over it" i just cringe...i really thought I was beyond it...i still do, that part of me does not reign, however, isn't bingeing just as bad???  i do choose to be happy but it doesn't mean i know how to cope any better.  so i still have my dark moments.

      Oh, I am so excited!  I just got done having a discussion with one of my friends from india...he recently was married and his wife is now here.  well, she likes art and wants to take some art classes, which is what i have been contemplating for a while now...so I was talking to him about how I want to take a painting class in the fall and if he thought his wifey might want to go too.  Anyway, he told me our art institute offers classes...duh!!! I never even thought of that!  So, I went on their website, and they even have a certificate program...general or specialized.  Wow!  Sign me UP!!!  I have to start with a basic/intermediate drawing class..good.  I need some help on that.  Then I think I will start with a painting class to see if it is what I have been dreaming about...if not, there is pottery (maybe), photography (YEAH!), and some other stuff...I think, including graphic design (hmmm...) so I think I have found my sould food!  Good god that took long enough!  Now, I just have to get the hubby to agree...they are kind of expensive.  But, hey, Christmas, Birthday, etc...right!

      I really should have written this a long time ago, but it has been a crazy week...  So, we went to the 4th of July parade like hubby insisted...I really didn't know what to expect.  I assume he remembers that is where I saw Mr X but neither of us have said anything about it, being the good little communicators that we are!  So, we parked at the High School parking lot and walked...hubby said that he was going to find us a great spot...in my head played the theme from Jaws...I tried not to be obvious when I let out a humongo sigh of relief when we passed Mr X's Parents house...but I hadn't released the whole sigh yet when hubby said "how 'bout here?"  Okay...less than one house down from Mr X's...ew.  And, of course, the direction the parade comes is the direction I have to look to see the house.  At first, I thought I was clear...I saw sister, grandpa, stepmom, and dadl but no Mr X..then it hits me...the guy in the hugely baggy shorts, ugly blue tshirt, and BALD man is Mr X!   Wow...what a year can do to a guy!  I tried to stifle my laugh...he is BALDING...and he looks like he has some disease because he is MUCH thinner than when we were dating.  Now, when we were dating, I was less than a 6 with pelvic bone and ribs sticking out and we would compete to see who had more pelvige...but he is way beyond that point...serioiusly, sickly.  Then I saw the new thang...old...bad perm up in a barrette and banana clip, bad bangs, worse glasses....short shorts--too much cellulite for me! and a halter top...now, I do not practice ageism...but unless you have a seriously rockin' bod...you should not be in a halter top!  Those were made for skinny girls with moderate bosoms.  No big hooters...no barely there...there is a specific body type that can get away with a halter and she was FAR BEYOND it!!!  So, that made me want to burst out even louder!  Ah...it really was good for my ego...  Alas, I settled down and enjoyed the parade with my balding hubby and son...so thankful I wasn't about all that.  Then, I realize Mr X and sister are standing exactly opposite of me!  I really tried not to look up...very difficult, but I didn't want to let on that I knew they were right there...I really don't know why they were, unless they realized or thought it was me and was just verifying that fact.  But, I haven't heard from him, so I don't know if he saw me or not...Now, I dressed kinda cute, but not too obvious...my flare jeans and a pink tank top...the pink accentuates my tan:)  No, really I hate tank tops, but I have this evil multi-faceted tan going on and I knew it would be a primo opportunity to try to get it evened out...boy, would I like to know what the reaction was:)  But...I probably never will.  Hubby is really having a hard time with this whole thing...and he has every right to.  Counselor said a) I should've never done it (i would agree in theory) and b) I owed it to hubby to be honest a LOT sooner...again, I agree in theory.  Am I making excuses?  no...I 100% agree that I crossed the line.  However, the results were satisfactory for me and will help me in the long run...it is so hard to explain.  But...if I hadn't called him, I would still be fantasizing about our "life" together and wishing it was over between my hubby and I ...plus, I have been able to get closure on a lot of questions and have been able to look at Mr X with the light of reality, not romanticizing it... as for point b...i think i would have done more damage to tell him in the midst of it that i was 2 minutes from walking out.  I would have had to deal with the counselor and hubby's emotions/reactions and not been able to fully complete this.  Selfish? yeah, probably...but again, it allowed closure to an area I really didn't think would ever see the grips of death, and now i can happily say its done.  hubby doesn't believe that, and I really can't blame him...its like a bad re-run.  but i have never had so much peace about this area...and there really are no more questions in my mind about what happened between mr x and i...  my bf is pissed i even said anything and said i was selfish to tell him.  then she said i should have told him after the first time if i was going to tell...hmm, she's fucked up.  she continues to lie to her hubby and i think she just wants drama in my life to vicariously live through...sorry chicky!  I hate drama...i apologize this whole fiasco caused drama, but it was not my intent...i've been over that since college...maybe that's her deal, she never went to college...now, I'm just being mean.  it just really disappointed me that she was so harsh and that it was so obvious that she wasn't giving sound advice.  that really leaves me back at square one with no one to give me sound advice.  i guess that means i am stuck with therapy for the rest of my life?!  NO THANK YOU!  I am scared poopyless for the day I have to go to counseling to talk about this whole thing.  We went to ss yesterday and I SWEAR he changed the lesson once he saw me...that's what we call Conviction (notice the capital C!!!)...  i'll fill in the rest later...gotta work...yuck!

      Talk about hostility...  Yesterday, b had four of his friends come over to play outside...it was pretty funny.  at first, b was trying to run around to get his toys that they were playing with.  after the 100th time of telling him that if he didn't share he would have to have a time out, he resolved that he would just have to make sure they new the toys were his...so he went around "mommy that's my truck"  "mommy that's my car"...to which i kept saying "yes that's your XXX, isn't it fun sharing with XXX?"  i don't think he was convinced this was fun!  But it was so cute to watch a bunch of 21/2 year olds who are only children play but never really play together...they all had their own thing going on and occassionally they would acknowledge each other...like by splashing each other or trying to swipe a toy.  Hubby and I made nice I guess...I decided, be upset or forgive...ughhh...i chose to forgive.  So, I tried to stay awake to see him but wasn't successful, so I just snuggled with him when he came to bed...hopefully, I didn't drool considering I was still pretty much asleep.  Nervous about possibility of seeing mr x tomorrow.  Hubby decided he wanted to go to the richland parade...he knows i saw Mr X last year and i am hoping the reason he wants to go isn't because he wants to hunt him down!  i don't think he would do that...especially because of his career choice, here's hoping!

      whoops...and if I would have just told him what was written down below, I would have been in a lot better place than last night!  I decided to wait up for hubby...I honestly wanted to smooth things over...it is so hard to be without your husband during the week and only get to spend quality time together on the weekend...obviously I am the only one feeling this loneliness because he just doesn't put forth the effort...okay, that's not exactly fair, but the guy is so fucking melancholy about everything--it drives me crazy!!!  I did ask if that is what the deal was...is it because we got into a groove and he figured he could lax on his responsibility and we would be okay???  He had nothing...nothing to say except I am ornary...what did he expect?!!!  I get so tired of his overgeneralizations...all of sudden I am ALWAYS ornary and there has been NO change...hmmm, I said so basically you are calling yourself a liar...he didn't like that too much but I told him that is so contrary to what he has said in counseling and on our date that one of them had to be a lie!  Anyway...it was bad, got worse, and still isn't resolved...so we'll see if he actually calls today...bastard.

      ahh...what a weekend!  Hubby actually asked me out for a date on Friday...so after a mad rush (he asked on Wednesday night) to find a babysitter, we were able to go out!  We decided to go walk around the Celery Flats and then out for dessert.  We bit the bullet and talked alot about the letter...I was able to explain alot and he told me how he could tell that my stress level had changed significantly from the time I put the pieces together.      I just talked about how I could finally understand where my parents came from...and that it isn't that they don't love me it is just that they are incapable of loving me the way I need to be loved.  How sad...I mean, I could be angry at them, but understanding the difficulty I have gone through, I just feel sad for them.  Especially to know that I will never have the relationship with them that I want because they cannot handle it.  It leaves a hole in my heart too but I think it would be worse to be them.  To have a child and yet not be able to have closeness with that child.  It just makes me determined not to repeat this with b.  I also told him about Mr X.  He actually laughed...though I don't think it was a haha laugh...I think it was more...I can't believe this shit isn't over...which is pretty much what he said.  He also gave me a compliment--which I don't really think he meant as one, but I took it as one:)  He said "At least you're honest, you have always been that too a fault."  Exactly!  I have always wanted to stay honest, even when it hurts, I hate fake people!!  Yet, I digress...he said he doesn't know what he thinks right now, except that he wishes I would cut it out.  He wanted to know every gory detail...which, of course, hurt.  I mean...I had to tell him that I had seriously considered walking away from our family....he asked if I was going to go to him, and I told him I had considered it.  But when it was there, I knew there was no way I wanted to be without hubby...I sat back and pictured my life without him and it made me cry...I want to be with hubby for the rest of my life.  I tried to tell him that but I think he thought it was bunk to smooth things over.  I told him that he was like my parents, emotionally and physically unavailable and Mr X was really the only person that met those two needs.  I told him about having to find some closure and remembering why it is I walked away.  I don't want Mr X...I don't think I did in the first place, I think I wanted the things Mr X gave me...  It was exactly this reason why I never saw Mr X...I knew when I had to have this conversation with hubby, that if I had to tell him I SAW Mr X it would be over.  I knew that if I disrespected our marriage to that degree I was saying that I didn't want "us"...whew!  Thank goodness some of my reasoning skills still are intact!  Anyway...he has been very distant from me since this conversation, which is understandable.  But I get so tired of not being able to TALK things through...  Case in point...I go home for our Monday lunch...am greeted by a HUGE box that he has piled with my papers...Now, this is the guy that has boxes of junk in the attic, basement, etc that I have BEGGED him to go through, and all of a sudden he has time to pile MY junk into a box!!!  Half of it was HIS!!!  Can you tell I'm mad?!!!  I about blew a gasket...okay, I actually did.  This whole weekend I watched and took care of B while he putzed around...I actually think he realizes and feels guilty about this because he has basically been avoiding me...which is what he does when he feels guilty.  Anyway...I started screaming about how I couldn't believe he did that.  That my few papers on the counter weren't bugging him...to which he said he was trying to cook and they were in his way...some were on top of the microwave (which is all that will fit on it) and then the others were a) on a stool or b) on TOP of the buffet...none of these places could be used to cook...which of course I screamed at him...he actually laughed and then got pissed because he knew I was right!  then he just started pissing and moaning about everything and then I laid into him about how he never even bothered to say thank you that I watched b all freaking weekend long without a break...and made dinner before the party yesterday AND then he didn't wash the dishes so i had to come home to do them!!!  Man, I am getting mad just  typing this!  I just get SOOO sick of him acting like he is better than I am and that by my few papers around the house, I was being a substandard house-wife...which is totally not true considering I do all of the cleaning WITHOUT his help...and he STILL has not given me the list he was supposed to FOUR MONTHS AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!! AGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  and if he has so much energy to pick up my fucking papers, maybe he should pick up his own...and tell me thank you once in a while, and call me when he is supposed to, and get up on Friday mornings!  The fact is, lately, he has gotten to the same mother-fucking point as before in which I am the one that does EVERY SINGLE FUCKING piece of relationship work and he doesn't do SHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!

      ugh...I get so tired of people projecting their feelings and emotions onto me...  bf called...told her I had two numbers for her x.  Asked her to really consider if she wants them.  I offered myself up as an example of how a spouse can take it...she said a) i would never tell my hubby, i think that was so wrong...and b) i am not looking to "hook-up"...excuse me?!  All I responded was that I believe honesty is the best policy even when it hurts...she said, if you were honest with yourself you would admit that you wanted to start something with mr x.  um, no...i have been honest with myself.  do people think that it is easy for me to admit that when i did call to get CLOSURE i was so messed up that i started re-playing a tainted view of reality in my head???  I mean, come on!  The guy was psycho...why was i such a lame-o that i considered it for a few days???  that's honesty.  i am kinda upset but i don't really know why i care.  i think because it just keeps tearing away the phisod of what i thought was a mature, adult, WOMAN friendship...it is a woman friendship...never able to quite get past the cattiness of nature to be real.  and to that i say UGH.  she also said something to the effect that she thinks her x still wants her...and that i will never really know if mr x still wants me because he never saw me now, just remembering what i was in high school.  ouch!  what the fuck does that mean?  and how the fuck was i supposed to react to that?  now i'm getting more mad.  i just am tired of people draining me to make themselves feel better and i truly need to stop giving a flying fuck.    on a happier note, since i am throwing around the f word...a guy i work with, who NEVER swears, said clusterfuck a few weeks ago.  I don't think i had ever heard that one and it made me laugh SO HARD!  so now, whenever it is visible that he is frustrated, i ask him what word he would use to describe how he feels...to which he replies "FUBAR, CF"  interpretation: FUCKED UP BEYOND ALL RECOGNITION, CLUSTER FUCK  good day!

      ahhh...still basking in the glow of home sweet home...nothing quite like the comfort and security of not feeling like you have to bust your ass to live up to a standard that is unattainable.  just being me...  So, this past week was when bf was in town.  He wasn't available until Wednesday night...so I invited a few people over for dessert...not many could make it, only K and Ang.  So weird that Ang came, she NEVER comes especially if I am there...anyhoo...Tom was being a dork.  I had to call him to make sure we were still on, this is at 5pm...people are going to be showing at 6:30pm...he says he has to run a load of laundry through the dryer and then he will be over.  I make a run to WalMart...get back at 6:20...Ang shows up 5minutes later.  No Tom, No Tom, no tom...K shows up at about 7...no tom, no tom, no tom...no offense to them, but they were not very entertaining and I didn't really want to hang with just them.  I finally call and leave a message for tom asking if he flaked...he shows about 8...whatever!  He looks good, really good, in a Tom way.  Someone told me he had started to look like his dad weight wise...don't know what they were smoking!  He is balding a little but is slim and trim and actually dresses this era!  It was so strange to be in the same room, we hadn't seen each other since a short visit in '97 or '98...I was so happy to see him...and I had absolutely nothing to say.  ugh...hence, why I hate socializing...what part of my repetative schedule would you like to hear about?  the part where I get up and go to work, get off work and pick up b, go home and make a pb&j, put B to bed, go to sleep...yeah, that's the routine...not much conversation.  I didn't really want to talk about the vacation...I was having too much fun listening to K spill the gossip on everything under the sun.  She was SOOOO shocked I didn't know some of this stuff...and I finally said, I don't really have the space to remember this stuff that has absolutely no effect in my life.  HA!  She just said, yeah, I never remember this stuff either....um, HELLO?!  You have been blabbering for 30+ minutes about EVERYONE...where does the not remembering part come into play...can we skip to that part???  Always hard to admit when you are the town crier...she actually tried to rope my mom into being the one to blab about something pretty confidential...yeah, right!  To which I said, "K, if my mom knew, I would have been told before you were and I never knew..."  THat shut her up for all of two seconds.  A) I don't know if my mom would have told me, but I would hope she wouldn't have told HER! and B) My mom could have told me and it could fall into the "i forgot" clause...but it was fun to watch her squirm:)  Talked to bf...she wants her x's phone number...I did better, got 2!  Not sure if she really wants it so I want to have that discussion first...good lord, look at the mess it has gotten me into!  Later!

      Ahhh...the sweet comfort of home!  Went on a week long road trip with the parents...hubby had training and races, so B and I bummed a ride to the vineyard and brooklyn...it was so nice to take a week off.  The vineyard was SO different than what I was expecting.  When I hear of the vineyard, I had always thought, beautiful green everywhere, rich, upscale...mmm, not exactly.  It was very pretty, I love water so I thought it was great, cars were everywhere, people everywhere.  It was neat...lots of cute little shops...lots of people with cute little accents.  My family made ourselves right at home in an italian restaurant...kudos to fernando's!  He was so cute...he looked as though he was tearing up the last night when we told him we were leaving the next day...but he maintained composure long enough to tell me he has never met a person who didn't like his tiramisu.  hmmm...mark it down.  Fernando, dahling, I don't like it...it satisfied the unrelenting chocolate urge, but as a texture freak, it kinda scared me.  But, I am sure it wasn't YOURS I am sure I would feel the same about everyone's.  It was good to see my sis...although, between my parents wanting to escape B and I and her working, I really didn't spend a lot of time with her...  Then it was off to Brooklyn.  Ahh, the big apple.  It was hotter than a mother there!  and of course, my sis's air only works in the bedroom, so I felt like I was receiving a steam treatment the moment I walked in the door.  We walked around Manhattan and SoHo...went to the WTC site.  When I was there last year, right after it happened, they weren't yet allowing anyone close, so it was really moving to see the huge void in the ground.  Guys were working...got to see the memorial everyone has been contributing to.  Also got to shop at the street vendors.  I felt it would be sacriligious to dicker with the ones selling wtc/nypd stuff.  So I just found what I wanted and bought.  BUmmed I didn't get to go to China Town and dicker with those vendors...that is the best part of NY!  Also, spent a few hours in H&M...the parents and B collapsed in some easy chairs and were almost passed out by the time I was done.  Went to D&DL...all out of chocolate covered expresso beans!!!!  What an outrage...no fix for me!  B was so good in the car!  The grandparent factor was working miracles...  It is so nice to be back home...i have come to so many revelations with my family, and made such great strides...I was feeling myself slip when being with them for so long.  It is so hard to still be the black sheep and the one who can never do anything right.  It gets old to hear them sing the praises of every other sister but never have anything nice to say to me.  It hurt.  It got old.  Glad to be back in the safety of my predictable life.  Glad to have a hubby who missed the shit out of me and couldn't wait until we were back as a family.  I think that is what hurts.  I don't think I will ever feel safe with my family...always waiting for the punch to come flying out of nowhere...you know it always does.  I love my family to death and would do just about anything for them, but at the same time, they drain and stress me out.  So, I was glad to get away but came to the realization extended family vacations are a thing of the past...  More later...I have to do some work-ew...

      cool...my bf called last night and it was actually a NORMAL conversation...we goofed around, gossiped about the people we knew, you know, bf crap...near the end he got very preachy, but it was more understood from the other things he had told me.  it was good to know that our friendship hadn't become all weirded out...  he is coming to visit! of course, he is arriving the week that I am going to visit my sis in Martha's vineyard and my other sis in NY...but he will be here for a partial week once I get back.  He wanted hubby and I to go to Cedar point with some others...but a) hubby will be out of town, b) b and I will just be getting back, and c) some others are ones that i can't stand for 2 hours...let alone, in a car, for HOURS and standing in line together for HOURS!  He thought it would be all cool because that is what we did on our senior skip day in which only he and I skipped!  yEAH, that would be cool from that standpoint but too many other eghs.  now, my other bf is upset because i told her i might not be able to come this year to TX...Pharmacia was taken over by Phizer so I don't know if I will have a job by the end of the year...also, with this NY trip, it is costing what I would have spent on TX.  I just don't know if we would feel comfortable spending that money so closely together...I used the cop out "don't know if I'll have a job"...but I don't think she's buying it...I told her I would keep my eye out for a cheap ticket but I can't promise anything.  that's all for now...I have to go work:)

      you know...sometimes you just have to laugh to keep from crying...  my boss' boss was supposed to get back with me on Monday about a raise I asked for at the beginning of August...when I called on Tuesday, he said that he needed 1-2 more weeks...whatever!  I am pretty stressed out...especially when I looked on line and found out I am making the lowest amount an admin is paid in the area...and that person enter with 0-1 years of experience!  I guess I need to get out of my comfort zone and start looking...yuck  To top it all off...Scott has cut me off...no talking, nothing.  The most contact we have had with each other is when I kiss him goodbye in the morning...We had an argument on Monday (?) night about his attitude during our phone call that morning...I had asked for some money for clothes...he said no...I WANTED to say a few words, but tried to take the high road and told him I should get off the phone.  He got all snotty and threw in my face "Now you're going to tell me that I treat you like...yadda, yadda, yadda" Stuff that I said in our last "heart to heart"  Then I did get mad and said goodbye.  I tried to calmly talk to him about how that is not mature and we need to get beyond this so that we can have ADULT conflict...again, bearing my hurt, and my soul...he INTERRUPTS me in mid-sentence to ask me where the 6 dollars is from our date.  WHAT?!  I asked him if he was serious...he was.  Boy, was I mad.  Anyway...I guess this is all just proof for me that I am not psycho...if I bring up conflict he totally retaliates later...right after, actually.  So this morning, after the stress of work, the stress of my husband cutting me off, I don't give him a kiss goodbye.  He gets pissed.  I said, you haven't talked to me all week, yet you expect me to be lovey-dovey...I'm sorry, I can't.  Then I walked out...then I walked back in and said, "You know, the funny thing is that you can cut me off and treat me like this yet think that I should still be affectionate with you.  Which is ultimately, why I will never understand you"  And walked out.  Looks like another great day...I really did not want to come to work...but staying home didn't sound very fun either.  I just want to cry.  The girls asked me out to lunch so hopefully that will cheer me up a little!  Wish me luck

      wow...who knew?  Hubby and I actually had a good weekend...I thought for sure it would turn out shitty after our argument...he always tries to pay me back for confrontation.  My parents watched b for us on Saturday...we went to a restaurant and shops in IN...it was actually fun.  Then, we came home and watched a movie, drank some wine HE had picked up...and other stuff that I will spare the details.  Parents decided not to go to church so we got to lounge in bed all morning...wow, amazing what some much-needed, uninterrupted sleep will do for a person!  We went to my parents for dinner...had a convo with youngest about school...she wants to switch her majors.  Tried to give her some friendly advice and offer suggestions of people she might want to talk to...she FLIPPED out.  started yelling about how she didn't need me ganging up on her...ugh...i felt bad, she obviously thought i was trying to tell her what to do, which was NOT my intention.  sometimes i really wish that we lived thousands of miles away.  my other sis is completely ignoring/avoiding me...i think that i will no longer invest.  i can't stand hyper-emotional drama...over that a long time ago...so whatev with a capital W...if they want to talk to me, they know how to get ahold of me.  bf still strange...again W!

       Okay...I know that the time always shows up funky...but it is 3:45 am...yeah...never happy times when I see this time of day!  Hubby and I had it out tonight...it is rather ironic that it is always his damn counseling appointment that starts it.  Today was a new one...I am childish.  Isn't the counselor supposed to help???  No, not ours...ours likes to give hubby fuel.  the great news is that he (counselor) wants me to come in next time.  Yippee!  I told hubby that i would but that i refuse to defend myself.  i mean, they already have it figured out that i am the root problem, so what can i possibly say to change that?  anyway...i need to calm myself down, so unfortunately, i will be major hyperv...i mean, ventilating... okay...1) knowing i was not going to see hubby for week when i went on vaca...asked numerous times for intimacy...rejected every time...lovely 2) when got back from vaca hubby NEVER and, yes, i repeat NEVER asked to hear the gory details of our trip.  I know his, including how many times he took a dump, but he doesn't know shit about ours (sorry, bad pun) 3) roof leaks...hubby suggests i talk to the guys at work about what to do...guys at work immediately offer to help fix and tell me what weekend they are available...i am to blame because i took over... 4) hubby refuses to call dad and friends to ask for assistance...i get frustrated 5) hubby is supposed to call to rent a roofing nailer...waits until TWO DAYS BEFORE to do so...yes, i get very frustrated 6) oh yeah, hubby tells parents at races that we will be attending cousin's wedding the weekend before the roof...then blames me and says that I am the one that told his mother...uh, NOT!  Then, gives no explanation to them as to why we won't be attending...which, as covered previously in counseling, leaves them to believe it is MY fault 7) hubby tells parents that he is bringing b up with him while he will be chopping wood...no he NEVER asks me if this is okay.  he mentions that this was an idea of his...again, tells his parents that won't happen and who do you think they feel is the problem??? 8) hubby calls everyday at work...almost everyday (I'll give him 85% because I feel generous) he starts nit-picking and an argument with me WHILE I AM AT WORK and can't imagine why i get upset... 9) cops an attitude constantly 10) still shows no sign of affection or intimacy for FIVE FUCKING WEEKS and yet, i am the one being childish because i suggest that this behavior might have something to do with why i am upset at him...go figure!  The saddest part is that hubby told me he just isn't comfortable with close relationships.  um, duh?!  then you should not have dated me for four years...and married me!  this is what really kills me and really is my grand point.  he knew...HE KNEW...i had no idea.  i told him UP FRONT all of my faults...my temper, my lack of drive for cooking, i am madly high maintenance with sex and affection...HE KNEW.  on the other hand, he played a good game getting me to think that he was very affectionate and loving.  for god's sake, he knows more about me than just about everyone...there is one person who may know more...but that is questionable.  that's what hurts.  my best friend was all an act.  and for what?  a good screw?  please, he could have gotten it elsewhere.  i am not really sure what his motivation has been for these years.  but it hurts.  i mean, isn't that was is "so great" about marriage...having your best friend live with you?  well, i thought that is what was happening...then reality set in and i find out i am living with a man who acts like he despises me...yeah, that's great for the self-esteem.  i really wish i could get beyond the point of caring.  but if i go there, what do i do?  walk away?  not really the life i have envisioned for myself.  divorced, single mom, child in daycare 40 hours...yeah, that's really fair to b.  what my roommate said is really starting to make sense...suffer through this stage...having kids and raising them...then divorce and find the real love of your life.  However, one flaw...after that many years, do you really believe it can happen?  damn.  i really wish i was not so interdependent.  i would love to have stayed single...

      A friend from work sent this to me and I thought it was cool (thanks Rebecca!):  A WOMAN SHOULD HAVE    ...one old love she can imagine going back to...   and one who reminds her how far she has come...    ...enough money within her control to move out and rent a place of her own even if she never wants to or needs to...    something perfect to wear if the employer or date of her dreams wants to see her in an hour...    ...a youth she's content to leave behind...    ...a past juicy enough that she's looking forward to retelling it in her old age...    ...a set of screwdrivers, a cordless drill, and a black lace bra...    one friend who always makes her laugh... and one who lets her cry...   ...a good piece of furniture not previously owned by anyone else in her family...   ...eight matching plates, wine glasses with stems, and a recipe for a meal that will make her guests feel honored..    ...a feeling of control over her destiny...    EVERY WOMAN SHOULD KNOW...    ...how to fall in love without losing herself...    ...how to quit a job, break up with a lover, and confront a friend without ruining the friendship...    ...when to try harder... and when to walk away...   ...that she can't change the length of her calves, the width of her hips, or the nature of her parents...    ...that her childhood may not have been perfect...but its over...    ...what she would and wouldn't do for love or more...   ...how to live alone... even if she doesn't like it...    ...whom she can trust, whom she can't, and why she shouldn't take it personally...    ...where to go... be it to her best friend's kitchen table... or a charming inn in the woods... when her soul needs soothing...    ...what she can and can't accomplish in a day...a month...and a year...

      talked to bf last night...still strange.  She is talking about coming up here with her cousin this fall.  I don't really know how I feel.  It will be for just a weekend so I am not sure if I would even see her.  She's coming to see family...I didn't know she even liked her family.  I know she is tight with her gma but not sure beyond that.  Anyway...I had some time to think this morning, I was more coherent than normal.  Thought about what I would say to her if I thought it would be received the right way...I have had plenty of friendships in the past that have sucked me dry.  I am very beyond the point of "needing" friends.  I don't bust my ass for my friends to turn around and have them dump on me.  Occasional dumping, I'm cool with.  I understand everyone has to vent to someone...and I feel honored if I am that person, however, dumping and personally attacking are two very different things.  I don't do the personal attacks to make you feel better.  It's about basic human respect...which took me a LONG time to think I deserved,  and now that I KNOW I do...I don't deal with people who don't give it.    Now..why don't I actually say this.  I want to believe that this was a freak occurence, but I don't know...it has happened twice.  The other part of me thinks she does this because she feels bad about herself.  WHich, isn't that why people always do it?  So, yeah, basically it comes down to I am a hater of conflict, I'm scared...I have lost many friends and I am not ready to say adios to her.

      Not much new...RR marathon this weekend, so that kept me happy:)  Got to catch up on the episodes I missed when we didn't have MTV.  Hubby went to help chop some wood for his gma up in TC...so b and I bummed it this weekend.  Hubby had told his fam he would bring b up for them to watch while he did this...of course, he never consulted with me.  I was NOT pleased.  He said "I just figured you wouldn't want him here" uh, hello???  He is MY son!  So, I left it up to him to decide what he was going to do but let him know I was VERY displeased with his action...not consulting me.  He has a shitfit if I do ANYTHING without running it by him.  Can you tell I am very unhappy right now?  I just get very frustrated, which leads to anger, and I am so fucking tired.  I don't have the energy for my hubby.  Like today, I asked if instead of hiking it to my house for lunch, b and I could bring some pizza.  Which, we had talked about us doing.  No, I spend too much money this weekend.  Okay, I spent $32 for Christmas shit...$15 on dinner (which was pre-approved by the $nazi)...will not be getting a puppy...and $17 at WalMart on stuff I needed.  Ah, hem...he spent a butload on gas to get to and from TC.  SO don't act like I was the only one who spent $...but, after I am done typing, I am going to Lerner because now I'm depressed and I am sick of his shit.  ANyway, he has been picking fights with me a lot lately and I don't know what is sparking it but I am done...he can have his shitfits bite my big ass.  So anyway, he told me no, don't come to work.  Fine, I'm not coming for lunch either.  bf broke down first:)  She called last night, but b and I just got back from WalMart and it was 9, so I told her I would have to call back...I'll probably do that tonight:)  Yeah...yesterday was cool...it was kind of rainy.  B took a 3 1/2 hour nap!!!  So I got to watch lots of RR...I don't like to watch with him there...he is too young for the adult content.  I don't really think I am ready to explain Danny and Paul making out with each other.  And I got to take an hour nap...  that's all.

      my goodness...it is a good thing that I am so determined not to get into my depressed stages anymore!  This week has been ROUGH!  see previous entry for one explanation...work has been so hectic.  I just celebrated my year anniversary--woohoo--and I've realized there are dry spells, really dry spells, minor work, and overload.  Unfortunately there is no happy medium.  This is the point I came into last year...with one team, it was a nightmare.  This year, thanks to my manager, I support 2 1/2 teams.  This is my lunch break for the day because I have so much #!@$ to get done.  Anyway...background info...refer to the 8/28/02 entry as to why I was already annoyed with bf.  I haven't called her since then...I think I talked to her one time because she called.  Don't get me wrong, I still love her...I still want to be her friend...BUT I am highly aggravated.  So, knowing how I am, I thought I would not talk to her until I can think through it and basically get over it.  And, for some reason, i haven't gotten over it yet.  I have been crazy hectic lately, so I'm sure that has a lot to do with it.  Anyway, she called last night, after a terrible day at work.  I was bumming with Brennan...we were both reading, so I pulled myself off the couch to get the phone...she started off with some snide comment about how she hates it when I screen my calls...whatever, told her I had to pull myself off the couch.  She immediately jumps into how she can't stop thinking about ex and should she or shouldn't she call...but that she doesn't want to wait until october 4th...the day before his wedding.  Then she says "weren't you going to call hiM?"  Yeah...for about two seconds I contemplated that!  I just do not like him...period, period, period.  I told her I never did and didn't want to.  She started to lay a guilt trip on me that she called Mr X for me and I owed her big.  Whatever, I guess I thought that is what friends are for.  I just said that she didn't hate Mr X like i hated her ex.  I don't do guilt trips.  So I tried to change the subject, she just laid into me for that too.  So I just shut my mouth...she went on blabbing and then asked what was wrong.  I told her I had a bad day at work...that I was overloaded at work.  THEN she starts "Oh, poor you, you actually have to do work when you go in, instead of just getting paid to sit on your butt"  MY HOLY GOD!  WHERE IS THIS COMING FROM???  I said ABSOLUTELY nothing.  Deafening silence.  A, look, you just really fucked up, silence.  Then she says, Who am I to talk? haha...no, no haha's.  But, yeah, that brings up a good point.  You wanted a live in nanny/housekeeper and you don't work outside!  I do...45-50 hour/week, have a house to keep up, a husband, etc!  So, yeah, I'm real fucking lazy!  She tried to recover but I was done by then and just was saying , mm-hmm, yeah, yeah.  Then she said, well I can tell you are in a pissy mood (YEAH...THANKS TO YOU!) call me when you feel better.  Okay, bye.  UGH!  Could I have just quietly mourned the 9/11 anniversary without going through petty shit?  A girl at work talked about how it was the firefighters' fault that they should never have gone into the towers...whatever, they were following commands.  And, as the wife of someone who is in that line of work, that is their conscientious obligation.  I don't really think that anyone believed those towers were going to collapse.  On a special I watched last night, it said the first tower lasted one hour forty-three minutes.  The second lasted fifty-six minutes.  That's a long time.  Long enough that you think you have time to save the thousands of people stuck in the buildings...personally, I am in high appreciation and awe at their efforts...I don't think I could convince myself to go into that to help save complete strangers.  So, for all the non-believers and critics, there are many others who hold you in your much earned HERO status.  Ah...explosion at the plant on Tuesday.  A runaway reaction.  It basically exploded in a woman's face and I just heard they had to spend 5 hours on her face.  She hasn't been released because she is having difficulty with her sight.  Her lab partner had his major arterie nicked.  47 stitches for him.  He was just released today.  Scary.  On a happier note...I always watch our animal control PBS show.  Saw the cutest puppy so b and I went done to check it out.  It is a little girl, about a year old.  She looks like a mix of Jack Russell/chiuhauha.  There is one person ahead of us for her.  So I have to call tomorrow afternoon to see if she is available still.  Then I will pick her up on Monday.  Not sure if Scott will go for it, maybe it will be a SURPRISE!

      ahhh...family time....  That should bring a warm fuzzy feeling, right?  Not so in the barto home.  It only brings anxiety, stress, and upset tummies...  My big sis has been in town for a week, so I have been seeing a lot of family.  Last night she wanted to cook dinner for everyone.  Couldn't think of a good reason to bail.  So I went.  It was a hideous day at work, which stresses me out to begin with...so I had no tolerance for family issues.    I asked my sis about her birth control because my gyno wanted to put me on high dose to get me to have a period which would hopefully force me to ovulate...my mom started saying "Oh, no...don't do that!"  Back off, mom.  She has absolutely no tenderness.  Thankfully, I was beyond stressed so I just told her calmly why and that I'm not in a back-off-bitch tone.  Then, as if I was asking for more abuse, I decided to tell them the great news the dr told me...that with a little pill, he thinks I will be able to get preggo.  This pill will make my body ovulate...which is what the dr thinks is my problemo.  I don't really know why I thought that my family could be happy about that.  Because I'm a fucking moron.  I should know that my parents are so self-absorbed that they don't give a shit.  A response of, "yeah, but doesn't that make you OVER ovulate...releasing more than one egg???"  As if this was some mortal sin.  Yes, if I take it, we have to also realize the risk of multiple births.  But since I am not the perfect woman that you obviously were, my body won't get pregnant without help.  And since we don't believe in more invasive forms of help, this is our last chance.  And that comment was absolutely it...oh, wait, my older sister said she would be jealous if we had twins...so i have a mother who thinks i am interfering in something i shouldn't and a sister whose reaction will be jealousy.  Wonderful...just another fucked up day in the world of barto's...  Had to get out of there...ate too much dessert, trying to round up b so we had to take a potty break, because we are training (YEAH!).  Went into the upstairs bathroom...b put up the lid and said "poopy"...I quickly shut it again and tried not to hurl.  told b that we needed to go to a different bathroom because this was broke.  tried not to make a big deal out of it, but told lil sis she needed to take care of her mess and went downstairs.  it wasn't "poopy" it was vomit...just like what we found in the hotel at the island...just like i'm sure was in the toilet of bennigan's the night before...i hurt.  i know you read this, and i don't really know what to say to you that i haven't already said.  i fight the impulse to tell mom and dad...the only reason i don't is because i can't believe they don't already know.  and i'm not convinced they have coping skills...they didn't when i went through my dark time, and i haven't seen a whole lot of change.  i don't want to make things worse...but i don't want you to think i am naive or turning a blind eye.  you need help...you need help...you need help.  i don't know who from, i don't know what will make it click for you.  but get it...embrace it...apply it...choose to use it.  this is not healthy, it's scary.  if i knew of someone to "tattle" to, trust me, i would be on that phone.  but i don't...i don't even know the goddamn name of your counselor.  you have to work through this and get beyond it.  if nothing else, choose to stop doing it.  it's hard, i know...it hasn't been until the last six months that i have been able to throw open the closet doors to empty out the skeletons that haunted me.  trust me, i still have dark times...still have self doubt, self-inflicting pain--convincing myself i don't deserve things, but it is a choice...it is a choice to entertain these thoughts, it was a choice to stop eating, it was a choice to have a psychotic boyfriend...you are choosing to vomit...to take diet pills...etc.  it must take an extreme amount of energy to continue this.  apply that energy into happiness.  I have told you before, only you can choose to be happy...it isn't an event, it isn't something that hits you, it isn't based on life circumstances...it is the way you choose to view things.  it is hard at first, but it gets easier.  trust me, it is worth it.  it takes too much out of me to be depressed about the little things...and i was someone that loved to be depressed...i loved to complain...i loved the drama.  but being happy is so much more.  you have a wonderful life in front of you...think of all the time you have already wasted by making your focus this.  i hope that you tap into the strength i know you have to turn away from this.  i hope that you decide to wake up and grab life by the hand and take it for all it's worth...and it is worth much more than hunching over a toilet for the rest of your life.  i love you more than you will ever know and i want nothing but peace, love, and joy for you.

      Wow...I can't believe so much time has gone by with nothing to say!  Okay...not really, but I have been trying to do some soul searching and changing.  I have come to the conclusion that my hubby is my hubby and I love him in spite of it.  He is who he is and may never change.  I used to think that I would divorce and leave...but I don't want that.  I truly cannot imagine my life without him and do not want to have a family in which he isn't there.  So, I have given up being angry at him...I am still hurt, I probably will always wonder what it was that caused the dramatic shift in behavior, but I don't think that I will ever have that answer.  But I do not want to add him to one of the long list of people that have exited my life.  So, we have had a few heart wrenching conversations...and in the past 2-3 weeks, we have been trying.  It is not always easy, and for the first time in my life, I can honestly say I have successfully biten my tongue and OUCH did it hurt.  But, it is better to ward off the nasty comments then to ensue a WWIII.  My mother-in-law is a certified nut bag and has shown her true colors.  She called me and without going into gory details, tried to get my goat.  Thankfully, the soul change had begun beforehand and I did not let her steal my goat.  So, she was unsuccessful and then tried to back pedal.  Too late...you have already shown that you are trying to get me upset and when it didn't work she came kissing my butt.  Well, two can play but I prefer not to.  I will be appropriate and, when need arises, remind her that she must be also.  Hubby agreed that he needs to support me and that I need to feel free to stand up for myself.  My friends and pseudo-friends excluded me...it hurt, but it shows you who your real friends are.  And, now, I just ask myself, why do I continue into the same trap of caring so much what others think of me?  I need to accept myself...my hubby needs to like me...and B needs to like me.  That's it.  I really need to get beyond these juvenile things and find friends who will uplift me also.  My family...haven't talked to the sis in AGES.  She is the one relationship that I absolutely regret...I cannot tell you how awesome it was to finally have someone who comes from the same place that can understand you more than anyone else who has come along.  I'm so worried about her...and part of it is my fault, because I backed off and maybe I shouldn't have.  I didn't know what else to do.  I miss her like crazy but don't know how to extend the arm...i'm a chicken, what can I say.  We used to email and talk...now nothing...nothing since I left the island.  anyway...before I cry...  So, life has taken its unexpected turn of events...and like usual, there are times I totally mishandled it and times where I can be proud of myself.  Damn...

      Well...I survived, if that's what you can call it.  It always amazes me how hubby escapes under the wire and i get all tangled up in it.  We didn't talk about mr x which HIGHLY surprised me...we talked mostly about my temper.  I love how our counselor tries to put words in my mouth...it is so evident that if I agree to what he says I will get punted across the room.  Yes, this occured again Friday.  He tried to get me to say that if hubby showed affection and intimacy that I would not have a temper problem.  Uh, no!  NOT what I was saying....I said, I have had mad stress at work, family life, and with hubby...my hubby has no idea the other stuff that I have been stressing about...so that makes it worse.  However, even if he did his part, the other stress would be there...it is just that with the other stress his not doing his part makes it worse...I am beyond the whole "i am an island" bull shit...i want someone there beside me.  Boy, it was funny to see him back peddle on that one.  We talked about our lack of church/christian friends...I finally pointed out after two years that this was not my choice that this was because of hubby.  To which he told me that I could be friends independently of hubby.  Yeah, I do know that...but it makes it difficult when you never see anyone.  It isn't like I am going to call up X and say...hey, I haven't seen you for a year, you wanna be friends?  Please!  Counselor told me that half of everyone does what we do schedule wise and still finds time for friends...I have friends, just not the friends that I suppose he thinks I should have.  Quite a few of my friends are religious, I don't know if they are Christians...heck, I don't know if the people that go to my church are Christians!  But I am also beyond the "you have to go to xyz church to be saved"...yes, I believe there will be catholics in heaven.  Anyway...I disagree with the half thing...It is very different to work full-time but have both parents home at night...I am a single parent throughout the week (as is hubby)...we have family time on the weekends...It is alot of work, not being able to SHARE the workload.  It just aggravates me that he would say he was an authority on the matter...I don't do babysitting much during the week...that is my time with B...and by the time we get home, he has had a full day and doesn't want to go out.  I am not complaining...we chose this, we deal with it...but I don't need anyone, who doesn't have ANY idea what we are going through, to pass judgement on why I am to blame I don't have the "appropriate" friends...hubby really didn't have much to say.    The other fun one is accountability...every week we are supposed to basically sit down and bitch at each other about the week...what you could have done differently, what I should have done differently...does it sound like the breeding ground for war to anyone else???  Healthy conflict is what I have been striving for...not what I think hubby wants.  I basically said I didn't like it and didn't want to do it...got blasted for that one!  So, we are going to do it...lovely.  Ahhh...I hate griping so much so I will make this the last...church.  Why would you have all couples who are "committed to each other" come forward...yeah, i'm pretty sure it never crossed my hubby's mind to go up...we didn't and I think we were the only couple left in the pew...I was hurt at first, but now, I just am looking at it from hubby's view...says alot to me about where he is at.  Was at grams everyday last week...whew!  I need a break!  It has to be hard to get to the end of the road and have to start divying up your stuff...I am so glad she is in town now...I just need to be able to keep sanity.  It is really amusing to see my parents.  They have no patience with her...I'm not sure why, but it makes me wonder if that is how I am with hubby's mom...

      yeah...i'm getting nervous...tomorrow is my big "summons".  I printed off my blog because, as usual, the week of my husband starts acting appropriately and I need to remember exactly what has gone on.  she did it...she called her ex today.  i think it is bogus that she waited until 2days before the wedding, but whatever.  She of course was crying...she thinks he was sending mixed signals.  THe guy told her when they were getting off the phone that they would probably never talk to each other again...hmm, not sure what signal that was sending.  I shouldn't be such a bitch.  I don't really know why I am...I think because I am annoyed.  She is so whatever the current conversation is.  Like before, when she told me she didn't have feelings for him...yeah, I pegged that one...then today, she said that it was different for me and mr x because i never had feelings for him like she does for hers.  I said, well, i did, in a weird way, but yeah, i knew i am in a lot better place...yeah, i need to get hit upside the head with a sympathy stick.  I mean, what if mr x was doing well for himself?  Then, it totally would have been harder to cut myself off AGAIN...and if, on top of it, he was getting married...wow...yeah that would suck...i'm a jerk.  I got my raise finally today...and now i have to go...

      Wow...I didn't realize how long it had been...and so much crap has happened.  Let's start with the not-happy #$@! that way I can end on a good note...b's birthday was last week, so we had his birthday party on the 16th.  my m-i-law had said that hubby's dad wouldn't be coming because it was on the opening "Saturday" of deer hunting season...but, low and behold, the bitch showed she is just out to manipulate my hubby because his dad did come!  Ugh!  Anyway...I had two crafts planned and then we walked to the firestation a few blocks away...now, when I had called, I forewarned them that the party was for a 3year old.  So the fireman that set it up said we would just have a two minute talk and then the kids would be allowed to play on the firetruck.  Uh, whoever that was forgot to mention that to our tour-guide.   He was an older gentleman...very nice, but VERY talkative.  He must have talked for 40minutes...at LEAST!  I guess another fireman rescued the parents and allowed the kids to start playing while the other jabbered away.  Thank yoU!  Anyway...as we were leaving, one of my friends pulled me aside and asked who my m-i-law was.  I said "the short one"  she, of course, had figured that out...based on past incidents I have vented about...anyway, my friend was standing with her son who had been misbehaving and had a time out from the firetruck and she said my m-i-law started saying how she couldn't believe that I would do this for a 3year old party...that this was inappropriate and I should have waited until at least 5 or 6.  Thankfully, this is my friend who is NOT shy in the least...turned and told her how much fun her son was having and she thought it was a wonderful idea...that her son loved firemen and they had already been to his school.  What the #$%^ was my m-i-law thinking?  I just can't believe she didnt' know that comment would come straight back to me...so did my husband...so the only thing left is that she is 1)a moron (already proven) and 2) out to hurt me (already proven)...so really, nothing new came out of it.  I just need to realize this woman is fucked up and that she will never truly accept me or welcome me into her family.  This weekend hubby got angry at me...basically it came out that I am supposed to be cooking, cleaning, and watching b...NOT doing "fix-it" work on the house...that's a "masculine" job.  And he told me to turn in my two weeks.  I was devastated and don't know what to think...I told him he knew that cooking and cleaning was never going to make me happy...and that WE bought the house together and that I enjoyed helping fix up OUR house!  What a crazy fool!  Ahhh...now that I have that off my chest...my bf called last night and asked if I would do a girl's trip to Vegas in march...At first I was very hesitant about it...I seriously think that I am agoraphobic to a certain degree...I told her I would talk to hubby and then get back with her...well, I thought a lot about it last night and this morning and I am TOTALLY in!  Now, I am praying that it actually happens!  Call it kismet...I had two emails this morning for discounted rates to VEGAS!!!!  I am going to check them out but they seemed legit...one from Ramada...that would be so awesome and much needed!  So, I will try to get ahold of her today and tell her I am there...that also means I have to start penny-pinching!

      hmm..what to tell, what to tell.  Hubby skipped his appointment last week because b was not feeling good.  I gave him a hard time and told him it was just because I have been "behaving" and he would not have anything to talk about.  In a way it is true...we both have been on our best behavior and it feels so nice to have my best friend back.  We actually can kid around and laugh together...amazing!  His parents came into town on Saturday and spent the night...boy, I have never been so happy to see hubby go to work!  No offense to my hubby, of course.  But, his parents can't communicate with me so about 5 minutes after he left, they left...thank god!  It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be, but it still wasn't good!!!  Hubby brought up the fact that I have given up meat...you know, vegetarian...no meat...I'm sure you know what I mean...so, on Sunday, hubby's mom is making dinner...a pizza thing that has pepperoni in it...so I ask her to please leave a portion without meat.  Seriously, she gives me a look like I have a gun to her head...and asks why..."because I gave up meat"..."what do you mean you gave up meat?!"  (Thinking, remember our 10minute conversation last night moron?!) "I don't eat meat...but if it is too much of a hassle, I will just pick it back out"  "so, does that mean you won't let anyone else eat meat?" "No, it isn't about a social consciousness" "what about thanksgiving?  are you going to make my son eat vegetarian for thanksgiving?"  (now understand, she now has a tone that she is talking to a nazi) "no, mom.  I will make a turkey but won't be eating any myself." mom exits in a huff...what a freak!  I don't know what her deal is other than she is a lunatic.  She talks about hubby's sister-in-law like she created the moon...how very annoying!  I guess I need to be thankful that I don't see them very often!  B's birthday party is in a couple weeks...I pray that they are only coming for the day!  I am dreading the possibility that his parents and bro and wife will be staying over night.  If that is the case, I am praying for a mammoth migraine!!!  Other than that...my bf called.  B was being naughty so I had to let him go...still weird from his visit.  Actually, that was the first time since his visit that I have talked to him.  Other bf called...said she was in the hospital.  I never know whether or not to believe her...that is so terrible!  She was really shook up about her hubby and her x.  I feel her pain since I went through it...it just would have been a lot easier to support her if she would have been upfront about it from the beginning and not trying to blame me or rip on me about it...

      Okay...so I haven't been the most dedicated blogger:)  But, it is the holiday season...the time for madness and mayhem!  I am so exhausted and so not wanting to work...half of the plant has off this week...but I have $$$ in my eyes, so I am hoping to force myself to work at least three days this week.    The fam went to Chicago this weekend....it was fun!  Hubby, b, and I got up bright and early to go to IKEA...can I just say, I LOVE that store!!!  There were so many things I coulda/shoulda bought..but hubby reigns me in...plus, we had to meet the rest of my family downtown so we were doing some MAJOR power-shopping.  But I am one of those people that if I had a five minute time limit could come out with a hundred bags.  I know what I want...don't get in my way!  We all ate at Maggiano's...yummy!  Had some sinful desserts...then it was to the hotel.  Very nice...  I must give kudos to myself for not being tragically lost in the city.  I actually stayed calm and applied what I knew...my issue is that I know how to get to certain locations...I don't remember names of streets.  But we did awesome!  I am so proud:)  Then we went shopping...I much prefer fighting crowds in Chi-town than traffic/loonies in Kzoo.  I just felt like I was home.  I can never explain why...but from the moment I and all of my belongings hit that city, I knew that I had come home.  It is a place filled with so many different people...all shapes, sizes, colors, styles...and no judging.  It truly feels warm and cozy...like I have come running into arms of acceptance.  And as I ramble, I think I am realizing that this is what I miss...here in Kzoo there is nothing to do.  So everyone judges and criticizes.  Does it really matter that I don't have on designer jeans...that I bought mine for $3 at target?  But idle hands make idle minds and I think this is the disease of Kzoo life.  So, this weekend was bittersweet.  I hadn't been back since February...too long.  It refreshes me so much!  Yet, I realize as I talk to hubby, that we will probably never go back.  He does not miss it...he hates the traffic, people, cost...he says its too much.  So, I am not holding my breath to move back...just looking with anticipation for any amount of time I can be there to rejuvinate.  And, yet, I terribly digress...we were shopping, and shopping, and shopping...finally, hubby took b back to the hotel and my little sis and I went around.  It was alot of fun...she is the one that out of all, I have spent the least amount of time.  We shopped until our feet almost fell off--literally!  And then decided we should go rest...hubby got some krispy kremes...sinful!  And we watched a movie....b decided to get up at the butt-crack of dawn!  Too exhausting...we ate breakfast and left....we HAD to stop by Michigan City to hit the outlet:)  A little disappointing, but that could be due to how hideous b was behaving...  The fam was coming over Sunday night to celebrate christmas...hubby and I decided to have a relaxing Christmas day...so that meant no mad dash to get to fam's or have them over....so we did it last night instead!  I baked ALL afternoon long...man, my body HURTS!  I didn't get to sit down to about 7:30 and I had forgotten to eat.  It went well...I was more stressed out than I wish I had been.  All in all...a great weekend.  It's just a matter of deciding that someone else is not going to dictate how you enjoy your own life...and being able to apply that to family too!  Now...I guess I should talk about what has been going on in the past month...but I have to get planning the rest of my shopping (AHHH!) and Christmas lunch---why didn't I plan better?!!!

      I am highly disturbed...my internet won't let me onto purplepanda or rw/rr blog...what the heck?!!!  It says it is against the usage policy...after 1+years, they changed it?!  Whatever...I will find a way!  Vegas is for sure...I think...end of March, bf, her friend, and I.  So...I am committing to less eating, and excercise...I don't want to be the fattest one of us!  IT is hard enough to be the fat one of the family...but I will NOT be the fat friend too!!!  It sucks...when I focus on eating less, obviously I become obsessed with FOOD which I then want to EAT...ugh.  I am quite happy though...I just ordered a new Cindy Crawford excercise video and the Romy and Michelle DVD...awesome!!!  I cannot wait until they come in!

      I'm getting better...it hasn't been quite as long:)  I am supposed to be training someone but she got caught up so now I have some free time:)  So much to discuss, so little time...  Okay...my bf thinks she might have lupus...I don't know if I believe her or not, how hideous is that?  She has an appointment this Friday, so I hope she doesn't...we are supposed to be going to Vegas at some point...march or april...she wants to buy tickets and make all the reservations, but knows that if she is too sick she won't be able to go...my issue is $$$ I can't fork out cash for a trip that isn't going to happen.  So I have been trying to slow her down.  Also, I am extremely late on my period...and I am hoping for the best but expecting the worse...I don't think I am but I know my hopes are already high that I am...so I will basically be devastated if my damn period starts.  But, if I am, I don't know what that would do for the trip...I am at a higher risk of miscarriage and would need to consult with my ob before I did anything...plus, hubby may want us to save $$ so I would not have to work if I am...  Along that line...it is so hard not to have anyone to confide in about the possibility.  I don't really have a friend that I could tell...well, one.  But I don't want to tell someone, find out I'm not, and then have that person feeling sorry for me.  I just feel so isolated with this.  No one understands how worried/deformed I feel.  No one gets why hubby and I don't want to do anything but the natural way...I just look at b and think that I do not want him being all by himself.  I know that our siblings will eventually have children but how old will b be at that point?  And who is to say they would be close?    oops...gotta go!

      Ahhh...isn't it lovely to be working on a beautiful Sunday afternoon???  I can hardly take it anymore!!!  I am trying to make up some hours that I will miss...even though hubby said it wasn't necessary...I feel guilty, so here I am!  All that is getting me through is knowing in only 2 1/2 more days I will be on a flight to Vegas...yeah, baby!  I can hardly wait!  I will be driving to meet my flight in O'hare and stop to shop along the way:)  I am bummed only by the fact that due to my rental car, I will not be able to visit IKEA...and I will be arriving to early on Monday to stop...bummer!  But, I will just use it as an excuse to go later:)  Vegas...here I come!  All day THursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday...four whole days of glorious freedom!!!  I pray that bf and I get along the whole time...right now it seems as though our eating habits will be what makes the difference...she sounds like she wants to eat the entire time...I gracefully tried to tell her that I can't do that unless I am tied to the crapper all day, lovely, eh???  Especially now that the curse has come to visit.  I am praying very HARD that it disappears by Wednesday, it could happen!  Not sure what we will do, Celine is not looking real...no response from the damn dj yet...I'll email Sabrina again tomorrow...maybe she can bug her again...she really thought they would be pulling through.  I told bf if we hit big while we are there, I would be willing to go...otherwise, I am not paying $150+ for anyone!!!  I am hoping two things...one, that I have a relaxing, stress-free time...and two, that I hit big enough to pay off a major bill...other than that, no agenda but fun!  Now, mind you, to succeed on number two, it must happen on the $50 limit I have placed on gambling...so, basically, if I succeed with number one, I will be happy!

      okay...so yes, I still am slightly weirded...and, as any good psychology major would, I have tried to psychoanalyze myself and come up with the following (please realize feelings have absolutely nothing to do with what is reality):  I was nuts because mr x was my back-up plan...yes, yes, very sad to admit...but in my head (not the rational part I might add) he was who would be there when no one else would be...being someone with low self-esteem/self-worth and having had many many many people walk right out of my life, here was a guy who thought I was god's gift to human kind.  Yes, I do realize he was also psychotic, but that really has nothing to do with my point.  So, when I find out he has now replaced that sound philosophy with someone else, it was disturbing...what about our hypothetical children???  What about our rendezvous in 10 more years???  Yes, I know this was never going to happen, but what if???  Now, I have no one as back-up...which, realistically, is good.  Still a little weirded out...tempted to call and say "congrats"...weirded out by the possibility there will be children not involving me...but overall, happy...why?  Because in the real world he was a crazy m'er f'er and this means he won't be darkening my doorstep...no, that is just a defense mechanism...glad because it sounds as though he has moved on and has, hopefully, found someone that will make him happy and is right for him...just like I found the one that is right for me...

      Wow...it's been a while...so much has happened...including celebrating another anniversary of my birth...  But, that is not what I want to talk about...this is all very strange, so please bear with me...  Let's start with some background...starting in high school, early high school...I would get these premonitions.  It was weird at first, I would brush it off as coincidence...then, it just got freaky.  It was like a pit of your stomach feeling...something was about to happen, I would never know exactly what--not that detailed, but I would know something.  It became too often to be coincidence.  So, for high school and most of college, I paid attention to this and it was getting more precise...being able to tell who was on the phone, thinking about someone I hadn't talked to in a while and getting a call...knowing something was about to happen...freaky.  So, when I had a meltdown in Chicago and purged crap out of my life, this was something I began to ignore...I didn't have the energy it took.  So, a few months ago, some of my work friends went to see a psychic...the psychic told one of them she got vibes she was a wicca (SP?)...well, sure enough, this girl had some freaky occurences with a ouiji board...so, my birthday...one of the girls had debated between a psychic reading for me or some quarters for Vegas...she chose the quarters--Yeah!!!  Anyway...so, yesterday I was thinking about if I did go see a psychic...would she recognize if I had any sort of funky capabilities...which got me thinking about the fact that I really hadn't paid attention/noticed anything for a long time...  B and I get home...I check the mail and grab the newspaper...same as I do every single day...sorted the mail--mine, hubby's, crap...but instead of setting aside the paper, like I do EVERY SINGLE DAY, for hubby, I decided to open it up...once it was opened, I thought, there is nothing I really want to look at...so I just flipped through each section...looked at a couple sales fliers...and on the way to putting it on hubby's pile...decide to check out the last page...you know, deaths, births, marriages...WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK I SEE!!!!! Mr X is getting married!!!!!  I am like speachless...I don't know which I am more aghast about...the previous shit or the fact he is getting married...I am just so totally weirded out...I talked to bf yesterday about it...she really is the only one who would understand and she vaguely remembers this shit from high school...but I just feel so weirded out.  I told hubby last night about the impeding marriage but had to laugh it off like it was no biggie...which it really isn't, I just couldn't tell him I was weirded out because he would want to know why, and, quite frankly, I don't even know why...  basically, I just needed to discuss some more and I don't really know what to say and needed to relay it out again...hopefully, it will help me be non-weirded...

      ahhh...the ho-hum of life settles back in.  I have been relaxing, trying to have fun, and get all my crap done at the same time...not working so well!  I read "What Dreams May Come"...one of my fav movies, the book was pretty cool too.  It explained some of what the movie wasn't able to cover.  I also read "Riding in Cars with Boys"...again, love the movie.  The movie was actually just about a mirror of the book.  I have really missed reading...my next is "Tuesdays with Morrie"...I have heard it is a good one, we'll see!  For non-fiction, I am reading "Exciting Careers with Sociology" or something to that extent...before I commit to going back to school, I thought I would research what my possibilities are with my current degrees.  I have the Psychology one as well but haven't had a chance to start.  Planted a dozen rose hedges this weekend...what fun!  I can't wait to see them grow/blossom.  6-8 weeks!  I am now waiting for my miniature rose plants for mother's day.  I am hoping they get here this week yet...I am going to my in-laws for the first time in a year and would like to bring them now.  My grandma bought an african violet for me...I am hoping I don't kill it...my clover is not doing so hot...it keeps dying, coming back, etc!  I don't know why...I think it is the feng shui bug biting...but I have a thing for plants lately.  Went to MI City on Saturday with my friend and both our kids.  It was kind of chilly but we had a good time.  Hubby didn't scream at me about my purchases either...amazing!  We really have been doing so much better...I think that my resolve to behave mixed with my vacation has mellowed me...things aren't as serious as I used to crack them up to be.  It is so much more fun to enjoy life than have your panties up in a bunch.  Tomorrow is  DAY ONE  of the infamous Pfizer take over...we shall see.  No news in the big K-zoo on what's staying or what's going...  Before I go...I LOVE PUNK'D!  It cracks me up!  This is so my sick humor...why didn't I market that idea first?!  Halarious!

      wow...I really love calling in sick.  Hence, why I believe that I would be okay to not work...  Yesterday, we had to get the furnace maintenanced.  So, I decided the remote chance that the guy would have to come between the time hubby was gone and we weren't back from preschool yet, I should just take the day off!  Because of the time change, B slept until 10am...wow, that felt nice!  I decided to start painting the basement floor...hubby and I ate lunch, picked up B from preschool, took a nap, planted some flowers, tried out my rice cooker, read...what a productful day!  My heart is so not into work anymore...all I can think about is figuring out a cool job to have!  Hubby is talking about going to state trooper school...how cool is that?!  I am excited for him and am hoping to do the appropriate amount of nagging/encouraging to get him to apply.  One hurdle at a time...he is concerned about quitting work and not making it through.  I suggested that first he needs to apply and be accepted...he needs to get into shape so he can pass the physical test...then we can discuss the possibilities.  I have a big beef with a company that would not support a colleague to further advance.  In my mind, I would find it an honor to have someone advance to state trooper...a selling point.  Ahhh, but that is rational thought...not hubby's department!  Quite frankly, I would be okay if they won't let him take his legally approved personal leave, him turning in resignation.  Then, if he doesn't make it, he will be forced to find a different job.  Scary, yes...potentially financially straining, yes!  But worth it in the long run, hell yes!  I just want him to be happy and I know this is a dream of his...enter the nagging/encouraging...

      ahhh...still basking in the halarious memories of my trip...I keep remembering new things that crack me up...  okay, have you ever felt fake breasts???  While, I did!  Our friend Sandy at Studio54 had some amazing breasts, which bf was commenting on, she invited us to feel. BF wouldn't but I figured what the heck?!  My, fake breasts feel cool...they are so firm with a little squishy.  I am seriously considering having implants just so I can feel them all day..okay, not really!  BFbugging our bell-guy, Pierre.  He had to be my dad's age...and she just kept bugging...he told her he had kids, didn't phase her... BF walking around without shoes because she wore stiletto's in the airport...duh?!  Her feet were so hideous, I made her get a pedicure...understand, I hate feet to begin with...but these feet needed a makeover in the worst way...the pedicure helped a little...but they still need help!  Stan...this kid was halarious...think of Cody from that crazy friday night show that I can't remember the name of...oh yeah, Step by Step...yet not so annoying.  At one point, he was yelling at all of us because we were degrading his IQ...he said that his IQ was "Way Higher" than all of us combined...so I said...you have a 50...he said "at least!" 50 is right above the mentally challenged level.  Chad...he was too cute...he told me that if he never talked to me again, to remember there was someone in CA that would drop everything in a heartbeat for me.  It doesn't do me an ounce of good since I don't know more than his first name...and I don't remember where he said they lived in CA!  BF still thinks I will hear from him...I say, no way.  He totally would have called by now.  But he was so sweet, he definitely was on top of his game!  I just thought he was really cool...and not just because he liked me over BF...I am hoping that by the end of the month I will have just a vague memory of him...  Everything else is going well...B is misbehaving like mad, but hubby and I are doing so much better.  I think overall the vaca was good for my soul.  Seriously looking at graphic arts, with maybe some more english...I could do advertising or such and then start working on books...we'll see.

      okay...I am still trying to recover...but ready to spill the good dish...  Understand, my friend is very insecure...this is the only reason I can understand that she constantly asks guys if she is hot and flirts incessantly.  After about, two hours this gets annoying!!!  I am so the opposite.  Quite frankly, I don't care what people think...I mean, yes, I want to look good, but who are these complete strangers to me???  So, I am very used to these type of friends getting all the attention...it is the people that look beyond that behavior that I usually mesh with...there were a couple people like that.  It is actually funny, I met more people that were severely annoyed by her than enamored by her...kind of karma for me...I don't mind playing the back burner...I am very used to it!  Anyway, you get the idea...we can't step outside of our hotel room without her trying to flirt with everyone with a penis.  After a couple days, I was tired of it...I told her I was on penis overload...there is nothing fun about having old, horny men trying to get all over you.  The first club we went to, there were these dorky hispanic men that were too old to be there who kept trying to grind on me...boners gross me out, especially when they are so obviously desperate!  I was getting so pissed at her..I kept trying to ditch them and she kept reeling them back in...she kept saying, At least they are buying our drinks...point 2-I don't give a crap...I will buy my own drink, I don't expect someone else to pay for it...especially when I know what they want in return and there is no way in heck they are getting what they want!  So I kept hiding out in the bathroom...and on one trip, she busts out and does a line!!! OHMIGOD!!!  I was not expecting drugs to come into the picture!  The freaks that were giving it to her tried to pressure me into it...hello?!  I am 26 years old...a bit beyond peer pressure, please!  If I was going to give in, I would have done that a long time ago...I don't believe in using those types of drugs...alcohol effects your brain, I know..but that is as far as I go with an alternative state of euphoria...I'm a natural girl:)  So that kind of put me off too...  Also, we are in Vegas...did your hubby really believe that we would not be going to clubs dancing and drinking???  About every 3 hours, her hubby would call and need the blow by blow detail of what we were doing and what we had done since the last time we talked...drove me nuts!  Now, I understand that hubby and I went through some extreme situations, he has learned, I don't like to answer to anyone...so he doesn't feel the need to keep tabs...he trusts that I will do the right thing, and if I don't I will get myself back into line...unfortunately, I broke that trust and I don't really know that I should tell him...do I want to hurt him again?  At this point, I am trying to pawn it off as not a big deal...a little of it is working...a little isn't...  So...it was Friday night...we had met Sara and just partied WAY too hard at Studio 54...we were going to catch a cab...my friend needed to go to the bathroom, so I waited...we were walking out when this guy stops her for a cigarette...of course, she starts flirting with him...by this point, I had gotten so sick of it that I would keep walking and eventually she would catch up...well, she didn't, so I had to go back...by this time, she and Stan were sitting on a sofa type thing yacking it up...Stan had a friend...I was nice and said hi, but I think I made it clear I was not interested...but, watching her and Stan were like watching morons unite...halarious!  Two people that should never breed together, too close to brother and sister!  So, Chad and I started laughing about it...he was on the same page...so I figured I could just talk to him...he is from CA, cute, kinda short (just a little taller than I am) and exactly like Dave Matthews...he SAID he had a fiance...so I grilled him, of course she was tall blonde and beautiful...we just talked like old friends, my word, the majority of my friends until I got married were guys, so it was no big deal...I'm married, he's engaged...we decide to go get a drink and so Stan and Sam followed...we were laughing and talking and forgot about Stan and Sam who kept making out...so someone mentions going to their room...I think, no big deal, Sam can get her groove on and I can keep talking to the most normal guy I have met out in Vegas...  We get to their room...not before making fun of Stanley Leroy Jackson, III who seems to be too drunk to remember where the room is!  and has the same birthday as I do...just four years earlier...there are two other friends in there...who obviously passed out after having sex...they were cool, they liked to bash Stan too...it was halarious... They pull out some weed...again, don't do drugs, but I'm used to people smoking pot in front of me, no big deal...Chad opts not to as well...he thought it was "cute" that I had morals...yeah.  So, he grabs me and kisses me...I was completely taken off guard...i truly swear, I am the most naive person in the world...I had no fucking clue he liked me...I knew we liked talking to each other...well, low and behold, he is not engaged...it was a line...and, quite frankly, I feel like I am the only one who would fall for a bull shit line like that...I mean, come on!  So, basically, what it boils down to...I spent six hours with this guy, some kissing, some talking, a lot of making fun of Stan and Sam...he was so cool, so cute, so me.  I really felt like I connected with him...don't ask me why or how I rationalized all of it, but I did.  Sam and Stan were in each other's pants, though,  now she swears they didn't have sex...not quite sure I believe that.  Chad was so nice about not pushing himself on me...he kept telling me to relax, I kept telling him I have a son...and that I knew I was being played...which I did and I didn't...now I do, yet am still holding out hope he will call me...why?  Because, I feel like if we had met other than that way we would have been really good friends.  He left me with two monster hickies...oh so cool.  I flipped out...how would I explain those???  Luckily, they are gone, but I do feel like a jackass...and I feel like more of a jackass because I don't feel more guilty.  My hubby funds this trip and takes care of B and I behave like a college kid...I swear to you, I am not meant to be married.  I feel bad for my hubby...I really do.  I feel like he deserves to know that he can't trust me to stick around.  The only reason I didn't agree to go to CA with Chad is because of B...that's a little fucked up.  Anyway, I told Chad the only way I would believe that the entire night wasn't about his penis would be if he called me...so here I wait at work...and, surprise, no call...yet, I am still holding my breath...how pathetic...

      This is an email I sent to tell everyone the "G" rated memories...I will fill more in later!   Oh, boy!  I thought I would write one long email...I am so exhausted, yet excited to fill everyone in...it was definitely the trip of a lifetime  Sam and I met in Vegas...we both took red-eye flights out on the 26th...we have been planning this trip for four months, so it seemed surreal that the time was actually upon us.  Both being moms, our gut reaction was to go home to bed, but we knew how lame that would be if that was our way of greeting Vegas...mind you, Vegas is three hours behind ET time...so, our bell boy recommended "The Beach"... unfortunately, it was college night.  We had fun though, kind of set the mood for the rest of the trip...if you could get past the girls in their thongs (the cocktail waitresses).  Thursday...Friday...Saturday...Sunday...I won't recount the whole trip...we basically did not sleep until Saturday  night...we would take a couple hour nap and go back out.  It was great!  I really don't know how we survived...but it was a blast!    The best parts...winning $25 in a slot machine made my week...made it not hurt so bad when I lost at roulette.  Gambling is not my thing...I am too "frugal" to lose lots of money.  I ended up playing nickel slots...does not induce much pain when you lose all of $2!!!  We tried blackjack..everyone at the table was so sweet and helped us out...  We LOVED Studio 54!!!  It was so awesome!  I am seriously thinking of marketing this here in Kalamazoo, there is nothing like it where I have been...even Chicago pales to this club!  We met a great girl...named Sara no less!!! Who lives in Vegas.  She was so sweet and told us she would get us in and up to VIP because she is friends with everyone that works there.  When we got there, we were able to bypass the entire line, walk right in...perfect timing...their show was just starting.  There were ladies hanging from swings, doing acrobatics to the music, amazing! We felt the music getting louder and faster...Sara told us to watch up...all of a sudden, two people jump from the rafters, with bungee like cords, bouncing up and down doing all kinds of flips, etc...crazy fun!!!  To top it off...Jennifer Lopez was there...and so was Pauly Shore!  Like I said, one of the hippest places to be in Vegas...I would fly out there just to go there!  We rented this adorable car...it was a little larger than a go-cart.  It goes up to 30mph and you drive it up and down the strip...it was halarious!  We gave a couple people a lift...it was so much fun!  We took it into parking garages....quite a reaction!    The Venetian...beautiful, beautiful hotel!  I spoke with several Italian people...Sam kept telling everyone I was Italian...very embarassing when they thought that meant I could speak italian!  Our gondola ride was fun!  I swear this boy needs to marry my sister...He had an amazing voice and was serenading us down the river (mind you, this is on the second floor INSIDE the hotel)...well, we were all laughing and having fun and he said that he had a special song for us...he pulled under the bridge and said he would have to sing VERY quietly...then he busted out with "I don't think you're ready for this jelly..." etc...yes, yes, he was singing BOOTYLICIOUS...halarious!  We were crying we were laughing so hard!  Anyway...you get the picture...we had the most awesome time, met a lot of cool people, came home exhausted, but hearts warm with many many memories!  It was wonderful to see Scott and Brennan, and I am sure the memories will brighten my boring days at the grind with the engineers who have absolutely no idea what Studio 54 is...(hint~a recreation of a club named Studio 54 in New York, which was big in the '70s)...  Love you all~ Sar

      This is so halarious...a friend emailed this to me:   MasterCard Wedding!   This is a true story about a recent wedding that took place  at Clemson University. It was in the local newspaper and even  Jay Leno mentioned it.   It was a huge wedding with about 300 guests. After the  Wedding at the reception, the groom got up on stage with a  microphone to  talk to the crowd. He said he wanted to thank everyone for coming,  many from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially  wanted to thank the bride's and his family and to thank his new  father-in-law for providing such a lavish reception.   As a token of his deep appreciation he said he wanted to  give everyone a special gift just from him. So taped to the bottom  of everyone's chair, including the wedding party, was a manila  envelope.  He said this was his gift to everyone, and asked them to open their  envelope.  Inside each manila envelope was an 8x10 glossy of his bride having  sex with the best man.   The groom had gotten suspicious of them weeks earlier and  had hired a private detective to tail them. After just standing  there, just watching the guests' reactions for a couple of minutes, he  turned to the best man and said,"F--- you!". Then he turned to his bride  and said,"F--- you!" Then he turned to the dumbfounded crowd and  said, "I'm outta here."   He had the marriage annulled first thing in the morning. While  most people would have canceled the wedding immediately after  finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with the charade, as if  nothing were wrong His revenge...making the bride's parents pay over  $32,000 for a 300 guest wedding and reception, and best of  all, trashing the bride's and best man's reputations in front of 300  friends and family members.   MasterCard wedding for 300 guests ...........$32,000.  Wedding photographs commemorating the occasion............$3,000.  Deluxe two week honeymoon accommodations in Maui.......$8,500.  The look on everyone's face when they see the  8x10 glossy of the bride humping the best man... Priceless.   There are some things money can't buy, for everything else  there's MASTERCARD.

      It's so strange...I tried to pull up my archives, but for some reason, they cut out a large majority of my blogs...oh, to be internet literate!  Anyway...I always get a kick out of where I have been and where I am now...boy, was I a good case for some major Prozac!  I truly take myself a lot less seriously.  The scary thing is, I know that when I was starting to blog I had already come a long way from where I was...wow, I pity my friends and hubby from then!!!  What's new...hubby and I are so much better...I am not sure what happened...I know I just got tired of fighting the same fight.  Are we perfect? Hell, no!  I know he will always have his issues, I will always have mine...the challenge is finding a place to meet.  Sometimes closer to you, sometimes closer to me.  We have been pretty successful with that dance as of late.  Friends...wow, I forgot about the "falling out" with my mommy friends...unfortunately, that did not change.  The main culprit emailed me a few weeks or so ago.  I never responded.  I am still hurt but realize people have different ideas of friendship.  I am just beyond the point I need to try to force someone to be my friend.  I want a friendship where someone is as invested as I am...and her friendship was not that way.  I did make another mommy friendship...but she is very, very clingy.  She wants to talk every other day...I HATE to talk on the phone...I swear it is from talking too much in jr high and high school.  She will leave messages "I haven't heard from you in a while...um, two days ago!!  It just bothers me...I like my space and independence.  BF...never heard from him again...and I don't know how to get ahold of him...I love him, and pray he is doing well...someday...  Other BF...well, I just talked to her for about 20minutes after a little over a month.  Ugh...somethings don't change and some days I have more tolerance than others.  I have been having some health issues and was trying to explain and voice my frustration...hubby and I have no give to our schedule...I have work all day, b all night...nothing gives.  "Oh, that is the same way for me..."  Umm, you just got done telling me you take them to the pool everyday...and your hubby is always taking time off to take care of them...or they are at the daycare so you can be home by yourself.  How is that the same???  I don't know why this surprises me...nothing ever changes.  I just need someone to vent to about it...I am trying to stay upbeat about it, but it is hard to feel handicapped and see so many changes to your body and feel like you can't do a bloody thing about it!  T...I feel terrible...this month has been horrible with Scott's training schedule...so I have been acting like a hermit.  I haven't called her in forever!  I got to talk to her for about ten minutes today...but that's it.  I can be such a bitch...I really don't know why I get that way...I think I would be quite content on a desert island with my family and that's it.  Can't wait for the weekend!!! Going to Riverdance with some friends...other than that, hopefully relaxing!!!

      it's over...Buffy is all done.  I liked the finale, and I didn't...she turned down Angel..yeah!  But they killed off Spike...booo!  And, on his deathbed, Buffy tells Spike she loves him..."no you don't, but thanks for saying it anyway"...what?!  It was kind of a weird ending...but it was cool...  This is the last week of crazy scheduling...I realized this morning that every weekend in June is booked...that really sucks!  Someday, hopefully soon, our lives will slow down!

      I finally got to watch BOTs reunion...what a disappointment.  As everyone had reviewed on their site...nothing exciting.  How much more interesting if Emily had come and been her "Emily" self...oh well...  Bachelor finale...how predictable.  At least I can say I give him credit for choosing brains and beauty over just beauty.  Kirsten should grow up and realize, if you are so busy pointing out everyone else's faults, you make people wonder what  you are trying to divert attention from (Like the fact you have a boyfriend waiting for you at home!!!!)  Man...I am so glad I did not waste my time on Mr Personality...now, I understand that I just saw 10 minutes of it...but was that girl a total bimbo???  She seemed like such a flake...I was watching the unmasking (everyone: ahhhhh) hoping a total dog-face would be chosen...is this "reality" show real???  She chose a gorgeous guy who just happens to be a millionaire...hmmm, how coincidental!  American Idol: Sorry guys, I don't do the reminiscing...I'll wait til Wednesday to find out who wins...Reuben?  I hope so...  Not much else is new...went to the Dr.  I have carpal tunnel and possibly arthritis.  My parents both flipped about that...it doesn't run in our family so they are convinced I can't have it.  Well, I don't particularly care what it is at this point, just that someone figures it out and gets me better!  Four more days until Riverdance...two more weeks until anniversary...  I almost forgot!!!  SERIES Finale of Buffy...choose Spike, choose Spike, choose Spike!!!

      okay...either I have a lot to write about or nothing else to do...suspiciously, I think it is the latter.  And it isn't that I don't have anything to do...what I have to do just doesn't seem appealing.  Anyway...should I stay or should I go?  Still nothing on the job front...will the Pfizer honchos be the end of my reign?  Hard to tell...rumors saying everything under the sun...I'll wait it out though...hate change, hate new jobs, hate job hunting.  So, I may be living off unemployment for a while.  90210 reunion...I am kinda upset.  A big storm knocked out our electricity so I missed the last 15 minutes.  But what I was seeing wasn't that great.  It kind of reminded me of when they tried to get our senior class to have a jam session and talk about the school.  What do people who despise each other say?  We basically bullshitted...no one liked each other and no one liked our school...what a win-win situation!  Anyway...then I fell asleep so I missed BOTs reunion..bummer!  Catch ya later!

      okay...I don't usually comment on tv...how lame-0, I know!  But I have a few things I must get off my chest...  First...the Alias season finale...what was that about???!!! Do they think that I can wait until next season to find out why Vaughn has a wedding finger back on his hand...Sidney has been out of it for two years...and why they allowed Will to survive?!  I can't...of course, thinking back...I also was the one who obsessed for months that they could not kill off Vaughn from the season 1 finale...if you don't know what happened, a) you obviously have a life on Sunday evenings and b) are nuts for missing this show!  Anyway...very good cliff-hanger, but I don't know if I can wait...  Secondly, do you ever watch the Bachelor???  This is one of the shows I watch because I love to laugh.  Just like sorority life...but that is a different topic.  Anyway, last night...Andrew wants Tina to open up...Tina opens up and tells the guy she is majorly falling for him...first of all, coming from a family of people who do not open up, that statement to him, and it was more like a long conversation, was huge for her, and is he too dumb to realize that?!  Just because she is not throwing herself at him or bad-mouthing her competition...then, after she did not receive a rose, Andrew walks her out...he is trying to explain they did not have enough time together, yadayadayada...  then, on his follow-up interview, he says, "Even in the end, I was hoping to get her to open up emotionally, but she just never would" (NOT an exact quote)...umm, hello??? You just dumped the girl on national television and you want her to sob to you about how she was falling in love with you...excuse me while I exit the area, there isn't enough room with your head in the way!  I didn't even like Tina much until last night...So we are left with Kirsten, who I am getting sick of her nit-picking on everyone..."she isn't ready for a relationship"...this coming from the girl who had her boyfriend drop her at the airport on her way out!  and Jen, she seems nice...very real...as real as reality tv can be, i guess...  and while I am slumming it talking about the scary shows I watch...sorority life...like, if she, like, becomes, like, a sister, like, i don't, like, want to, like, be one, like, too...okay maggie!  This show cracks me up...it is the epitome of why I have issues with girls paying for friends.  One of my non-payroll friends and I were talking (okay, really laughing) about it...this is what we summed up: a) sororities, not okay...all they do is cat fight and bitch.  There really is no point except to out-mean each other. b) fraternities...okay.  Reason being, they have two goals, get laid and get drunk (and not necessarily in that order).  No harm done there...no one will be forever scarred by having an angry mob beat up on them verbally because they didn't curl their hair the right way. One of her "sorority" friends is so outraged by this show because it is so not like the way like real like sororities like behave...excuse me???  This is a mirror image of every sorority chick I know!  I think that deep down, sorority chicks are the most insecure girls...they are the ones that can't make friends on their own because they are too scared to put themselves out there.  So they pay for these friends and they all empower each other and they become the bitchy group of friends they are...so, in a way, I guess sororities are good.  They give girls self-esteem...but at what price does the end justify the means?  And, yes, I do realize I am now psychoanalyzing an MTV show!  BOTS...I cannot wait for the reunion...Melissa looks hot!  And somehow, I am disappointed that Genesis and her wife are no longer together...Jamie looks cute with the long hair and minus the beard...  anyway...enough about tv shows...

      well...I've been avoiding.  Not been a good week.  Hubby and I have been going toe to toe...is it coincidence that I have been feeling like shit?  I get tired of whine, whine, whine...so I decided to stay away from the blogger until the whine has left the building.  Anyway...today was actually a good morning...after yesterday, I thought I was going to have to commit myself.  I had been up until 3:30am in hideous pain...ready to cut off what was the root, but I couldn't find the root.  Anyway, this morning I woke up at 5am feeling great...except I had a kink in my back.  I tried to go back to sleep but the kink hurt, so, I listened to my body and got my butt out of bed to work out.  Wow...it is so lame-o, but I really feel great now.  I haven't been able to work out since Vegas...months ago!  So, to feel good, and have the desire on the same day was a mini miracle.  So, I did the A workout on my new Cindy tape and the first set of abs and arms/chest on the original Cindy video.  I didn't want to push too much, knowing I have to survive a day at work and this evening.  But, I did 25 minutes...yippee!  Just a side note...watch Paradise Hotel?  I didn't...but I was flipping through and saw this girl that I "recognized"...so I watched until I could place her...she was one of the girls from Temptation Island!!! Whatever!

      God has a sense of humor, right?  I hope so, 'cause otherwise this is going to sound very sacreligious...  I want to give a shout out to the Chief (God)...why?  Because I finally found a support group online...so I thank You for empowering someone (I haven't a clue who) to create the worldwide web...then to Maddy who created this support group...and finally, for my new "buddy" Jenn who is in the US!!!!  It really has helped to have a whopping two messages from this girl who is similar in age and experiencing what I am...so thanks!

      Wow...where to begin...so, my so called friend, the on again, off again...emailed me "just in case I didn't know yet" that mr x got married.  The thing that makes me laugh the most is that she truly expects me to have an emotional breakdown in front of her...this is the same girl, upon arriving home from the hospital after having b, had left a message for hubby "in case I hadn't let him know yet" and that I was in the hospital in labor.  Did she truly think I would tell her before I told him?!  Anyway, she would be the last person I would share my emotions with...unless it was a well thought out manipulation to spread the word around kzoo and surrounding areas...  I sound a little bitter, eh?  well, the other friend from work is pissed at me... why?  because I asked to change the dates of a camping trip...my bf's daughter's one year birthday party was scheduled for that day...well, now she is mad...can we say jr high?  I might even give her high school... this is the same girl that ditched us when we made plans to go to the bar, at the last minute, and never let me know.  this is the same girl that was mad at me when I told her I was diagnosed with PCOS (see a few entries previous)...why do I continue to make friendships with girls?  This is just not a good time for me...my bf and I haven't talked in well over a month...the other bf blew me off and has yet to call me back...I get so sick of this and I feel like this is the last type of stress I need right now.    I have been in so much pain lately...when I wake up...pain...when I go to bed pain...and most of the time, pain all between.  I have been trying to keep such a positive outlook on this, but I really don't know how much longer I can pretend it isn't there.  There are days I think I am going to fall flat on my face because my legs are so numb with pain...but I feel like I don't have a choice in my schedule.  I feel the worst for b.  He asked me the other day why I don't play with him...that breaks my heart.  I really need to focus on continuing to be a mom...i am so completely exhausted when I get home from work, but I should keep pushing, it isn't fair to him.  I try so hard to walk normally and pretend everything is okay...it is worse to try to explain to people what is going on.    I finally had a breakdown last week.  I think it was Thursday...my blood results came back and the dr wasn't there to talk to...the nurse couldn't tell me what they meant...I was exhausted, I was in pain, my friend had just gotten pissy with me...i just couldn't take it.  So, my other friend called for something and i didn't have it...and I just broke down.  How embarassing!  I am still trying to pull myself out of the funk.    It is so hard to allow myself to talk to someone about what is going on...I feel like they will think I am whining.  I am just at a loss as to what to do...my mom suggested walking on the treadmill.  I tried to explain how much I hurt, "oh, my legs hurt too, but walking helps"...okay...that sounds like you have muscle pain...not the same thing, but of course, she is convinced it is exactly like her, because everything I do is exactly like her...frustration.  I can't admit I need help, but I can't continue to do everything myself either.  I just feel like crawling into a hole and hiding out for a long time...

               Friend Bear     You are everyone's ideal friend because you are sincere and genuinely kind. Sometimes you worry about your friends' problems so much, you forget about your own responsibilities, which can get you into trouble. For you, it's the little things that really count.

      ew...I just joined Weight Watcher's...I don't know about you, but I really hate pushy people caked in perkiness.  That is exactly what this leader was...thankfully, I will not be going to these meetings regularly, I will be going to a different one.  I had the times mixed up, so I went this morning.  We'll see...  I forgot to mention...Mr X's wedding announcement was in the paper this past week.  He looks like he has shaved his head...she looked pretty...it was funny.  March 15th was the date...ironically, I don't really have any deep thoughts on this...I was just glad I got to see it:)  She is listed as a manager of a Max 10 in Coldwater (?) and he is an independent semi-truck driver...

      back from a wonderful weekend away...hubby and I went to Mackinaw City and Mackinac Island...to celebrate four years...wow!  It really seems so long yet only a few moments...so cliche, I know! but it is true...  Tomorrow is my big dive into the Weight Watchers club...fun, fun!  I was talking to my friends at lunch today...one of my friends, who I have suspected has a e.d., blew up...it was kind of comical, and insulting, all at the same time!  She said, workout...I said, I do...she said, watch what you eat, I said, I do!  People like her don't understand that not everyone who is fat is lazy...I guess I have been blessed with a life of diversity.  I have met so many people from so many different walks of life, I understand that everyone leads very separate, individual lives.  An event will effect me differently than it will you...unfortunately, not everyone is open minded or embraces diversity.  My other friend was really interested though...she has suffered alot of the similar things I have...she said her dr had mentioned PCOS but she never dug deeper.  I encouraged her to find out more...not for the soul reason of getting pregnant but just because of the health issues later on.  Just her reaction made it worth the other's.  I know I will face people like that for an eternity...and that is okay.  I feel bad more for them, than the discomfort they cause me.  I know what it is like to be closed minded, I used to be like that.  You miss out on life...you hold everyone else up to a certain standard, and yourself...no one can live up to that...and you spend your whole life frustrated and mad at yourself and those around you for failing.  Life passes by.  I am not sure why the mind change, but I can whole heartedly say, life is so much more enjoyable now that I don't take everything as a life or death circumstance.  There are serious issues, but not everything that arises is serious.  It is good to be able to sit back and laugh...I think I laugh the hardest at myself...  Anyway...sorry about the digression.

      what a long week...  ho-hum...dull drum of life...hubby's bro, dad, and uncle came down this weekend to help with the house...I keep saying we are almost there...could it be?  supposed to go to the Wayside on Friday but friends cancelled...gave me a good excuse to guilt my husband over him being an ass....anyway, ended up going to a going away party for a friend with my sis...the same sis this guy was in love with...it was nerve wracking.  High chance of running into christian school bastards...fortunately, none recent.  Just one that has not changed much...pretty funny!  Won't the girls be jealous!  It was so good to see P...I haven't really seen him since he left the christian school bastardization.  Things were weird between us since Mr X and I broke up...he and Mr X were tight for a while...but it was so nice, nothing about him came up and it was like he and I were friends all over again...however, I kept thinking, I am too old...it felt like your first alcohol party...it was funny...I had a good time though, paid for it on Saturday when I had to get up and be social...can't I just sleep a while?  Went to the dr again...she said she can firmly diagnose me with PCOS...is that good or bad?  A little of both...from what I read online, I should be (and am) very thankful we got pregnant when we did...there is no guarantee I will ever be able to get preggo again.  That is hard...but, I was being told that and trying to deal with that without a diagnosis.  Hopefully, it will mean some help with the weight issue...it is hard being fat.  I have been on strike since I got back from Vegas...so now, I need to convince myself to get back into gear, eat right, excercise, etc.  Supposedly, there is a medicine they can give to me if they find out my body isn't dealing with insulin appropriately.  This medicine will force my body to deal with it and, thus, allowing weight loss...finally, maybe!  Trying not to hold my breath since I have been fighting a long and painful battle with this for three years.  But a potential end is better than convincing myself I am okay with this.  Frustration...why didn't the dr's recognize this before?  Why did  I  have to bring it up?  She said the symptoms have been there since puberty...it is just a matter of no one having gone through my entire file...they treat for what you are presently there for...whatever...I am just trying to find someone to be mad at.  Until my bloodwork comes back, she suggested I check into Weight Watchers...she said it will be that much easier when I do see a specialist and I try to get them to prescribe me Metaformin...so, I will dutifully check into it...she actually did not recommend Atkins...whew!  That diet sounds nuts!  She said she has been on and off it three times and, yes, she loses weight but then will gain it right back.  Weight Watchers describes better the correct portions and formulas for healthy eating...here I go!

      A recent posting to my PCOS board...   Just feel the need to take a load off...I've really been bumming it the past few weeks.  I have been trying to get myself out of it...but it's not working very well (lol).  I'm so tired of constantly fighting...I'm still fighting to get an appointment with the endicrinologist.  This past week they came up with a new excuse...it's a doozy.  The dr's partners are leaving, so he must now go through all of THOSE files to see who he will be taking on...so no appointment for me and no promise of a date either!  Ugh...frustration.  My hubby gets aggravated because I don't throw a bigger fit about it...he doesn't get that I can't handle the stress that would involve...it is just easier to pretend it isn't happening and plug along.  Then...I decide to call for my yearly.  They want a nurse to see me instead of my gyn.  I told the woman I really need to see the gyn as I haven't had a period in a few months and am starting to be concerned.  She told me no appointments available through September and she can't schedule into October yet...ugh!  And the worst, I finally took the pregnancy test...I didn't want to continue taking the meds if I was preggo...and, surprise, I'm not.  Rationally, I knew I wouldn't be...but why do I give myself the glimmer of hope?  I knew it would be negative...yet I allowed myself to hope it would be positive...  Anyway...sorry for the rant.  I hope you all are well and happy...

      Wow...do you watch Fame?  It was so AWESOME!  Now, I get tired of American Idol...can anyone say follow the beat?  Those kids couldn't dance to save their lives!  I only would watch for Simon's nasty comments so I could yell at him...yeah, exciting life, I know! Anyway...Fame...these kids could sing AND dance...and quite well.  I mean, even the kids that got the boot right away tromped all over the American Idol kids.  Amazing...well, this week was the finale...and, I must red-faced admit...I actually voted!  I wanted Harlemm all the way.  Don't hate, Shannon, cause you have it going on too...but, please, who remembers the last ASIAN short, OLDER (30-something), male that was a POP icon?!  He seemed to have such a sweet heart...Shannon was beautiful, could sing, and dance like a mother, but she is the white female icon we see everywhere.  So, I was allowed five calls, I placed five calls, for Harlemm...and he won!  My faith in voting has been restored!  Mom saw nose ring this week...can we say maniacal?  I could not believe how explosive she was...then she started in on me going to the club...whew, get a life!  I hated to remind her I'm an adult and her manipulation techniques no longer work on me...oh, well, good to see I can still get her blood boiling!  Look out, the number one black sheep of the family is taking back the throne!

      ahhh...back to the life of honesty.  I was really starting to sweat all these lies I had to tell people.  But, it was worth it...one of the black sheep ditched us, so then there were three...and only one didn't know about the sex toy party.  So, first, one of my other friends showed up...we started talking and she was like "Who is that?" oh, that's my friend so and so... "Okaaaay"...no clue about what was about to happen.  Then SHE shows up...so black sheep is like "Who is that?"  Oh, that's Brenda... "How many people are coming?  I guess I didn't realize friends...(her eyes see the "Love Swing" Brenda is carrying) OH MY GOD!  I almost felt sorry for her...she broke out into hives...halarious!  She stayed for most of it...pay backs are hell, I'm not scared!  Found out JP and hubby are separated...hmmm...I could be mean, but I'll refrain...  I got my nose done!  I can't believe it, I got so nervous!  I tried to call hubby half a dozen times to see how pissed he would be if I had it done...but I couldn't get ahold of him...so I did it anyway...I'm thinking it's cute but it takes getting used to!  And, I constantly forget it is there, so I go to itch my nose and grab it...ouch!  Other than that though, it really doesn't hurt...and surprisingly it did hurt less than my belly button!

      whoops!  I guess it has been a little while...I have been expending all of my energy telling half-truths to half the people in my life... My friend is moving so we are having a black sheep party on friday.  She and I thought it would be halarious to have a sex toy party...the other two did not want to, so we are keeping this a secret from them...lie 1.  Then, my hubby wasn't real thrilled so I waited to tell him...lie 2.  I am having hats made up for us...lie 3.  I am in charge of getting her cake at work and getting her to the conference room...lie 3.  The issue is, I talk to all these people constantly throughout the day...do you know how hard it is to remember who knows how much?!  I'm getting my nose pierced on Friday...lie 4.  Then, this girl's neighbor calls and says she has a surprise block party planned on Friday.  She basically wants me to cancel our plans so hers can go through...ummm, no.  So I couldn't handle the stress anymore and just told my friend...she laughed at what a dumbass her neighbor is for planning a surprise going away party...did she not realize she would be making plans and have lots of things to accomplish?!  Now, the other two are dueling what we are going to be doing...I want to go to the piano bar...no I want to go dancing...well if we go there, I'm not going...can anyone say jr high?  So, to keep the peace (and knowing if they are acting like this they are REALLY going to be pissed about the sex toy party!!!) I offered to give up the tattoo/piercing parlor...no one will hear of it.  Shit.  I'm starting to freak out...do I really want a nose ring...how bad will this thing hurt?  you know, normal piercing reservations...oh yeah, will hubby kick me out?  Anyway...watch out KZOO...the sheep are on the loose!

      ahhh...so little to say, so much room to say it in.  where to begin...my dvd player is broken...which sucks.  I have worked very hard at buying dvd's without hubby finding out, and now I can't watch any!  I really need to go buy a new one, but, that would require me to go and pick one out...I haven't decided what features I would like.  Right now, we have a disk carousel...which I was originally very excited about...other than my movie obsession, I have a music obsession...which reminds, me...I need to turn on some music, hold on.  Okay, I'm back.  Anyway, the disk carousel doesn't automatically bounce to the next disc once one is done.  That sucks.  So, I am not sure I really need that feature since it doesn't do what I want anyway...then, after I do buy one, I have to try to figure out the wiring again...now, hopefully, this will be very easy.  Hopefully, the same plugs that I used on the broken one will just need to be put into a new one.  My hubby fakes ignorance on this crap, so I get to figure it out...boy is he in trouble when I croak!  Well...I made it to my friends party on the 21st.  It was too funny.  And, it proved to them that I seriously always run into someone I know when I go out.  At her party was this kid I went to middle school with...and we remembered each other.  I knew I went to middle school with him (4th or 5th grade)...he remembered where I live!  I guess we rode the same bus, which I didn't recall.  Once again proving this town is way too small!  Last weekend was another wedding.  This time, one of hubby's roommates from college.  It was pretty fun.  Met some of the rednecks from up north who cracked me up...  Well...the layoffs have started.  My boss still thinks I will be okay through at least the summer.  It is going to be so hard.  The goodbyes have already started...I just get too personally attached.  Some of these guys I have worked with for almost two years, I truly care about some of them.  A lot of my friends are aliens, so if they lose their jobs, they have 30 days to find a new job or else they have to leave the country...the man at work.  It's just sad to watch, and I worry about these guys.  Some of them are holding that rod awfully tight...I pray they can deal when it happens...  Boy, that ended on a depressing note, but it'll be okay.

      well...she came.  It wasn't too weird.  We basically chased toddlers around the whole time...I'm sure the teeny bopper at Formula K was glad to see us go.  She explained her marital status...they separated.  The next day, he was having sex with a chick from work.  A month later he wanted her back...they started talking about things, then found out he got this girl pregnant.  What a load of crap!  She is having a hard time deciding what to do...I don't envy her!  I told her to follow her heart/head about what was the best for her and her daughter.  How tough...split up your household or deal with his stupidity for the rest of your life...what a choice.  My older sis was back in town...I was weird...what else is new?  I don't know what it is about all of us being together, I can't deal.  It's like I'm back in middle school...I have good relationships, for the most part, with each on an individual level...but when we are together I feel like a deer in headlights.  They started in on me about my memory...mind you, this is an EXTREMELY touchy subject for me.  Since B, it has gotten progressively worse...this year being an all-time low...dr says it is in relation to the PCOS...I tried to explain to them, get them to back off, but, as is typical, this made the vultures more aggressive.  Thankfully, I stopped...which leads them to stop.  Why would it be fun if the injured animal doesn't fight back?  Right?   But Sunday, what a doozy of a day...no good reason, I went after hubby about his family...I mean, I will never get mine to change, so why not attack his?  Very reasonable if you ask me...(Please note the sarcasm)...  I basically stayed in bed all day.  I got up to call my friend, make some lunch, and relocate to the couch so B could watch a movie...it was about mid-afternoon before I could think about what I was so gloomy for...  Okay...so why am I the only abnormal one out of my sisters?  Why was I blessed with the scoliosis, bursitis, PCOS?  Does that make sense?  Not to me.  Not that I would wish any of them on my sisters, because I would never in a million years.  But why do I have to have it?  I guess this is what my online friends refer to as the solidarity of the disease...no one can understand it unless they have it.  I would give a lot if one morning, I could wake up from a normal nights sleep and feel awesome...okay, not even awesome, great.  It is so hard to have little to no sleep, get up, be in pain, go throughout your day trying to act normal, come home and take care of B, try to relax, go to bed and start the cycle all over.    Meanwhile, I have been instructed to lose weight...ummm, how would you like me to do that?  Okay...realistically, I mess up.  I overindulge, I will admit it.  But, I really do not eat much the rest of the time...it's almost funny.  I tend to eat the most when I am in front of people...I figure, they think I'm fat because I eat too much, so, I'll prove them right and overeat!  Like at my parents, I had steak (I'm usually a vegetarian!), a ton of veggies, a piece of bread, a stuffed tomato with rice, and followed it with a huge piece of cake and ice cream...oh yeah, I had chips and dip beforehand.  Please note, like I said, I don't eat meat...I stay away from carbs, I don't eat tortilla chips...and I don't particularly like ice cream.  But, I gave everyone else peace of mind by overeating and letting them continue in their thoughts that if I didn't eat so much I would actually lose weight.  Yesterday, it struck me.  Why do I try?  Why am I at Weight Watchers?  Everyone who knows about PCOS says the same thing,  it isn't your fault, you can't help the extra weight, nothing you do will help ...but what am I supposed to do?  Give up?  The GP said I should be thankful I've been trying...who knows what size I would be if I hadn't...um,  THANKFUL ?!  Yeah, I'm really thankful I'm only 50+ instead of 100+ lbs overweight.  But, it does scare me...what if I do stop trying so hard?  Will I gain another ton?  Yesterday was a really bad low, I have to admit.  I was two seconds away from running to the store to buy out all the crap food I haven't been eating...the only thing that stopped me was my own stench from not showering.  But, seriously, do I just give up the hope that I will ever be a normal size?  Now that hubby's dad and brother both have boats, do I feign fear of water?  Yeah...life is good.  I won't renew WW after I'm done.  It's a waste of money.  And as much as I hate to admit defeat, I hate wasting money more.  One of my friends wants to do yoga, so I'll do that...better use of money.  I guess I should just resolve to be as healthy as possible.  This isn't really in my control...the getting pregnant, losing my memory, weight gain, etc.  But I can help myself...I could really help myself by not being obsessed.  But it's hard not to...

      oh, oh...I forgot!  B and I had to run around to purchase patio furniture...so, we are at one store, and we run smack dab into this guy I worked with...a guy that used to tell our friends that if my hubby (then bfriend) ever broke up with me he would be all over me...mind you, he roomed with my hubby for a while as well!  It was a tangled web...he was also friends with one of hubby's friends...anyway!  SO, he and I were talking about life, we had seen his pic in the paper for getting married, etc.  So, B, not getting ample attention, decides to stick his hand down my shirt!  I tried pulling it out, he grabbed onto my shirt and started pulling!!!  Mind you, my shirt was a snap one all the way down!  This guy didn't know quite what to do, and, of course, B wouldn't stop!  Needless to say, 1) I'm sure he got quite the eyeful and 2) I was thoroughly embarassed!

      ahhh...nothing much new in my world...cuts as Pfizer are still going on...it is so hard to say goodbye.  You spend most of your day with people and then, they're gone.  My roommate from college is coming.  Hubby is going to the races this weekend, so she and her daughter will be coming for a visit.  It should be interesting.  I think it has been about a year and a half since we've seen each other...and, we don't really talk on the phone, just email occasionally.  I don't know.  It's weird.  So, hopefully, it will be just like old times plus the kids...  Sadly, this is all I have to talk about...

           Are You A Sex Goddess?        A brilliant bolt of lightning descends! SHAZAAM! The oracle has spoken!   The smoke clears to reveal that inside you is a divine being,   DEMETER, Goddess of the Fruitful Earth.   She is a deity who embraces all that man has to offer.  Sex for you is probably just as much of a spiritual experience as it is a physical one. You are an unconventional lover who doesn't feel the need to obey traditional gender roles or follow the norms set by society. Although you are a firm believer in experimentation, you never rush your sexual encounters. It's important for you to experience sex in a deep and profound way. When in the bedroom, you not only surrender your body to the experience, but you allow your mind and your spirit to join the action. Men find you to be a phenomenal lover, and they never fail to be completely elated and fulfilled when the night is over. Sex for you is much more than the sum of its parts. It's an experience that provides you and your partner with an unforgettable moment. For the men who are fortunate enough to share your bed, it's like a light streaming down from the heavens. Behold, the skies proclaim, here lies a goddess!    That's right, boys...you wish you could get a piece of this!  My hubby will be so proud...

      Ahhh....life....what a bitch.  Just kidding, just seems to be an extremely eventful time right now...so, where to begin?  I don't really have a long term memory for a lot of stuff, so I will probably forget something I wanted to blog about, oh well...I guess the stuff I remember is the most important, right?  First off, the best part...I finally got my hubby to break and we bought a baker's rack...yippee!  Do you remember when I mentioned I'm a bit ocd?  Well, this has been constantly on my mind for the past few months...I've looked at tons!  I wanted one for the kitchen to hold my microwave.  We had been using a microwave stand I have had since Chicago!  It looks awesome!  It makes the kitchen feel so open and big...and me so happy!  It's the little things in life:)  I saw one on sale at Meijer's, so I convinced him this was the best we would get...which is probably true.  So double whammy, I got the baker's rack AND it was on sale!  Now, for the other crap...Hubby and B went to his family's this weekend...his grandma burns wood for heat, so he went to help the family chop her wood.  So, I stayed home to work on the house.  My big project was refinishing our stairs.  These ugly things have been like this since February...yuck!  So, all week, I have been working on sanding so I could stain and varnish...so, I took half a day on Friday to finish up the sanding and get started.  My friend and I were supposed to go outlet shopping on Saturday, so I stayed up basically all night to get it all done.  Saturday morning...can't sleep, friend hasn't called.  So, I decide to be proactive and get painting.  I needed to prime and paint the underside of the stairs and paint my trim.  So, I pull out the primer and paint.  I start to prime.  Well, there are some spots on the stairs where the varnish and/or stain hadn't completely dried.  So, the primer was simply mixing...so, I decide to stop that and work on the trim.  I am painting away...at the top of the stairs is a window I cannot totally reach, so I bring up a stool.  I'm painting away when I shift my weight and a leg of the stool slips off the step.  I catch myself and the stool by grabbing onto the window sill...however, I also was successful in knocking the FULL can of primer down the stairs...from the top it goes clunk, splash, thud!  I was in absolute shock...I stood there just looking down the staircase, unable to fathom what just happened!  A minute later, it dawns on me, this is real, this is bad...so, I run into our bedroom and call mommy.  Trying not to have a nervous breakdown, I explain what I just did...to which she asks, "Is it oil or water based?"  To which I reply, "I don't know"...well, if it was oil based, you would know because it really stinks.  So, you just have to get a couple buckets of water and wipe it up, keep mopping until you get it all.  I thought, I can do this...so I tredge down the stairs (reminiscent of Titanic when they are wading down the stairs being flooded with water) trying not to make the mess worse than it is...I start cleaning it up, it's a bitch, so I decide I better look at the can...you guessed it, it's OIL based!!!  I quickly call my mom, on the verge of hysterics..."Oh my word...how did you not smell that?  Okay, get as much mopped up as possible as soon as possible and I'll be over"  Umm, have I ever mentioned, I don't have a sense of smell?!  So, here I am grabbing all the old kitchen towels, trying to figure out how to get a two inch puddle up...it is going everywhere!  I get as much as possible mopped up and sit down in it all...to start balling.  My newly finished steps are now stark white again...and it had been all I could do to motivate myself to stain and not paint in the first place, and now here I was back at the option of painting...ugh!  My mom comes in, and I tell her, nevermind, this is never going to get cleaned up...well, she has come armed with a dozen chemicals, and we are going to find one that works...thank god and the inventor of mineral spirits!!!  We worked for about three hours scrubbing mineral spirits with steel wool onto those stairs...and got almost all of it up!  Unbelievable!!!  I so wish I had taken a before picture, no words could ever describe how bad it was...even my mom admitted yesterday that she had not thought there was hope!  Halarious?  Yes!  But also scary that my husband still allows me to do most of the improvements!!!  So, hubby and b went to see his family this weekend...and, when he got home, he handed me this card from his brother and sister-in-law addressed to he and I...when I opened and read it, it said "Aunt S and Uncle S"...oh, god...she's pregnant.  Of course, hubby was eagle eyed to see how I would react...and, I think I earned an Oscar for my performance...I really want to be happy for them, and I think I am, but I also am dreading the next nine months.  She is three weeks along...how am I going to deal with this when all I want to do is cry?  I want to be sincere, not fake...what a jerk I am!  I feel like a real bitch, and, I probably am.  I was just going to mention to hubby about my wanting to discuss the possibility of taking chlomid...talking to the dr next time I go.  But I know he is now going to think it is because she is pregnant...and, it brings up the whole thing about the fact that all of my maternity clothes, baby clothes, and baby equipment is up north...do I have to give her what is left of our baby and maternity stuff?  I don't know if I could deal with seeing my stuff being used other than by us...I really don't think I can handle watching them use all of my stuff, am I a bitch or what?!  But, now, i know my mother in laws question will be, why don't we just give it to M?  I knew I should have beat them up for this stuff the past two years!  I don't know...I did the good "sister in law" thing and got a card and gift to send up there...and, again, I really am happy for them, it just makes it that much more painful for me and it makes it difficult for me to do my usual "coping" and just ignore everything that isn't happening...and on top of it, I just feel extremely guilty because I know this all has nothing to do with me but I automatically am thinking of how this is really fucking with my head!    So, the long and short of it?  My life seems never to dull of drama...what I wouldn't give for a quiet, peaceful life...I'm not as depressed as I would have been if this all happened a year or so ago...but, it is getting harder to find the humorous side of life...

      Okay...I have like five minutes before a staff meeting...but I have to piggy back off the last entry.  Newlyweds...last night...they are at a restaurant with Nick's brother and his wife.  They ask Jessica if she would like any of the buffalo wings that they are all eating.  She says, "No, I don't eat buffalo"...her sil says, "what?" Jessica says "I don't like buffalo"  Of course, they all CRACK up!  SIL "They aren't actually made out of buffalo, they're chicken" Of course, Jessica is royally confused so Nick's brother is trying to explain...finally he says, "didn't you ever wonder how they were buffalo wings but buffalos don't actually have wings?!" She says, "I guess I never thought about that"...halarious stuff! I am hoping she is cool and can watch this stuff and laugh hysterically at herself...otherwise, she is probably humiliated...I say, hey, we are all freaks, you are just getting paid bucco bucks to air yours on national television!  Anyway...not much else is new.  Work is super frustrating, our computer systems are supposed to be merging but no one can make up their minds to press the on switch...meanwhile, the rest of us are going nuts trying to get everything straightened out...  I get to refinish our stairwell this weekend...whohoo!  Hubby and b are going to his parents to help chop wood for grandma.  So, it will give me the time alone I need to do this project...and a weekend alone!

      Not much new...surprise, surprise, the specialist does want to see me...but doesn't have an appointment until January!  I guess I will take that as a good sign...nothing life threatening?!  I must address a show...NEWLYWEDS.  Can you say frickin' halarious?  Ummm...Jessica thought chicken of the sea tuna might mean it is actually chicken, not tuna.  She makes a mess, which she is utterly clueless how to clean up, while she is making her half ass attempt, she asks Nick is she is doing a good job...then asks if they have a mop.  Nick looks at her like she is nuts and says "How can you ask me if you are doing a good job but you don't know if we own a mop?"  This girl has obviously been extremely catered to..its kind of sad because she has no idea how to take care of herself, let alone her house and husband.  Makes you wonder what she will do when her parents keel over...but, on a non-deep level, it makes me laugh so hard!  I don't know if anyone else is watching it...I looked it up on MTV and it was a little buried in their site, but, I hope people are...it is so funny!  Kind of like what the first season of the Osbourne's was...  Other than that...my bf stole my sweats and shirt she borrowed when she was at my house...I should have known better than to give her name brand shit.  My CK sweats and a JCrew shirt...I'm trying not to be pissed, which would be a lot easier if she wasn't denying that she had them!  She says she left them in my closet, well, I scoured that puppy and was not shocked not to find them...ugh!  I keep trying to tell myself they are just clothes, they don't mean anything, but at the same time, do I need to lock everything up when she comes over?!  I think I'm a little ocd...let this serve as an example.

      ahhh...I'm exhausted...but I have visited all my frequent internet hang outs...so I'm left with my blog.  My "bf" showed up on my doorstep on Sunday morning.  Her grandma passed away unexpectedly and she had come to see her before she died.  She did not want to be there when hospice took the body out.  Her family life is messed up to say the least.  Her grandma had taken care of her when she was really little and they have been close.  She hung out all day Sunday, spent the night, and was there most of the day Monday.  The funeral is today but I'm not sure if I will hear from her again before she leaves tomorrow.  I always forget how high maintenance she is until she is around...she really is like having another kid in the house to take care of...I feel guilty saying that, but it is true!  I think that is why I am so exhausted...  B starts preschool next week...hubby and I had an orientation meeting last night.  As an example of how tired and mentally foggy I am, a lady introduced herself and I offered my hand to shake...I had a small cup of juice in the other hand and dumped it on myself.  It was like I could not focus on more than one thing at a time...I was about to leave because the first part was socializing (which I did not realize until it was almost done, I thought the meeting was just starting extremely late!) and it was so incredibly loud...I wanted to shut my eyes and lay down, I could not deal with it.  I still feel like I am in a fog...my allergies are acting up as well, so maybe the combo of everything is making me this way...I hope.  Anyway, we have an open house tomorrow so B can meet his teacher.  She did her intro and said this is her first "real job" since graduating from college...oh, boy.  I have mixed feelings about that, a little apprehensive.  We also realized none of the children from last year are in his class this year...they are in a different 4 year old class.  I think I am going to call to make sure he is in the right class!  I finally had my scoliosis xrays done...according to the report my curve has grown again.  Ugh...how much more can be wrong with my body?  I dropped the xrays and report off to my specialist yesterday, so I'm anxious to hear what he has to say about it all.

      Okay, girly...I hope you read this!  I had the right email address, but it says your box is too full!  L~  I got to read your blog this morning...I don't know if this is your email or not!  I'm hoping it is, otherwise, whoever is about to receive this will know I am psychotic...  Anyway...blog...no, I really don't think you are screwed up for leaving town and wanting to find yourself...I think that is awesome that you do that!  Besides the crap I was running from, my psycho-ex, my eating disorder, mom and dad, Heritage freaks, etc...that was one of the reasons I left dodge.  Although I didn't have the grand plan to find myself and figure some crazy shit out, I knew I was not going to survive going the way I was going.  And Scott and I had no idea what would happen between us.  I knew that I loved him, but I also broke up with him for a while...I couldn't deal with everything I had to deal with and be concerned for him at the same time...selfish?  Yeah, probably.  But at the same time, I knew in order to ever find out what made me tick, I had to get rid of the static that was diverting my attention from the work.    So, if you and Tony are "meant to be", I think you guys will come back together and  be better for the time spent apart.  This is the best time of your life to do this...once you get older and married and kids, you don't get to think about just you anymore.    I think that this is part of what happened to mom when we were little.  I think about what I went through by myself in Chicago...I don't think mom has ever had the liberty to do that.  She dealt with taking care of her mom and then her mom dying...then I think pretty quickly after that she found out she was preggo and her and dad got married.  Where was the time for her to find out what makes her happy?  Maybe that's why she was so angry all the time as we were growing up...she didn't have many choices in what she was doing...she went to a church that didn't condone any type of personal fulfillment ( I swear that looks wrong!) and she was a slave in her home...she had four girls, a hubby who expected her to do just about everything in the house...I couldn't deal!    SO, all that ramble to say...I hope that you find what you are looking for...I hope that you realize the beauty and potential that you posess.  No person is going to complete you, you do that for yourself.  Find what inspires you and grab on...choose to be happy, not tormented.    I love you~Sar

      did I mention I got new furniture?  Ahhh...so nice for everything to match, it makes me feel so adult!  Our couch reclines and our oversized chair is a sleeper...it is wonderful.  We have yet to receive the oversized ottoman, but i can be patient!  Bob is so picking Kelly Jo!  Meredith got booted last night and that is who everyone THOUGHT was going to win...I think Mary and Estella are BEAUTIFUL...please do NOT get me wrong.  They seem oh so nice too, but he and Kelly Jo just have this compatibility that I think they should change it to the Bob and Kelly show.  Too cute!  Ugh...so i missed RW again!  I was up until 9:50!!! And, I thought, I'll just close my eyes for a moment...when you are exhausted, you can't rationalize, because even as I was thinking that, I knew I was going to sleep right through, but I couldn't stop!  Of course, I can't find a re-run either...I still haven't seen the season finale of Newlyweds!!!  MTV kills me...now they have the rich girl show on...just to watch these two try to explain on how their self-absorption is not really self-absorption is ridiculous.  But, who am I to judge?  I was definitely NOT raised as a rich girl...my little sisters lived in a little more luxury than I did, but, not I...so, we'll see.  They keep showing this clip of Ali Hilfiger (sp???) saying to this "modern day Ryan Philippe in Cruel Intentions" (Oh, so philosophical, Ali!!!) that three very important people told her she is too giving...who are the three?  Well, two psychics and her friend Liz.  Hmmm...why are you seeing two psychics in one day?  What else is new?  No call from S yet...I think it is safe to say, I shouldn't be calling her my bf.  It seems so safe to have someone to hand the title to, and yet, I always hand it to people that are so NOT my bf...truth be told, I have a lot of great friends...it's unfair to label any ONE as my bf as they all act as a great friend should...not S.  In a way I feel guilty, I explained it to one of my other friends, and told her I feel like I am living high school all over...she said, a)I'm nuts to allow someone be my friend who steals from me and then lies about it and b) I gave her a fair shot and she still obviously disrespects me so I should let her go...I guess if she never calls again that will be the easiest way to deal with this...but it is never that easy.

      ahhh...Mondays truly suck dookie.  I hate coming back to work...I must say the past month or so, I have had no motivation to work...fire me...please!  I have gotten to a point where I am tired of dealing with all the bullshit...either I have a job, or I don't...just let me know and put me out of my misery...latest rumor?  We'll get word this week that we are all done and have two weeks to clear out...or that we will all be put through one company and our paychecks will get axed.  Now, I'm not that stingy, but...cutting my paycheck would be like bleeding a dead horse, you won't get much!  Can you leave my measly pittance alone?!  Okay...so I am sure some previously departed colleagues may gladly take my check...but I'm thinking, if they cut my pay, I would prefer to get laid off and get unemployment for doing nothing rather than actually working the 40 hours and getting the same amount...ya know?  So...my frugal side has taken over...I'm all eBay'd out for the time...it was pretty funny to watch S bite his tongue when THREE boxes were delivered on Saturday...man, i wish the postman would not ring the doorbell...of course, I was on the phone with my mil so I couldn't run and grab them...oh, well...he seemed to buy the "I'll have the $ when the bill comes" theory...and it was also pretty funny to see his reaction as he is looking at all the knick-knacks in the living room...HA!  I made him put up a shelf in there so I could put pics back out...he just rolled his eyes...but I have to admit they are cute...now if my Pucca stuff could just arrive!

      Okay...so, I had to do one of those jr high things with your answers in it the other day...I was going to cheat and use that as a blog, but I forgot to copy it!  Plus, the opening paragraph was a tad hostile...calling people lame if they didn't do it correctly...whatever...so, of course, everyone did it the "right way" and I never got my answers back!  UGH!  People have to do a lot more than that to be lame in my book...plus, I was funny, so I can't "recreate" it...too bad.  Another cool story about my roommate...she met the Bachelor Andrew you know, the one that chose the cute girl Jen...she and our college buddy stood in line for four hours to meet him...and I guess Jen is even cuter and more petite in person!  Plus, I guess Kelly Jo from KALAMAZOO is hanging out with her mom in Wheaton right now...I know my sis was wondering where she was hiding out at...there you go!  And now, to let you know why I am about to be murdered...I have an obsession...eBay.  EVIL!  I can't stop!  First, I wanted to add a layer to my living room...so I decided to go with a collection I've been wanting to start but know my hubby will not like once he is on to me...kissing.  HA!  So, I am scooping up these figurines and such of people kissing...it is so cute!  Well...then, I was looking under "kissing" on Ebay when I came across the most adorable animation... PUCCA!  She is a Korean cartoon and is ADORABLE!  So, I just won a bag of her and am hoping to have the faceplate in a day...I'm in deep shit.  But I can't help it...you go find her and tell me if she isn't the cutest thing!

      Hey! did you know Matrix will be out in about 2 weeks!  I hope they show his naked ass again...yummy!  Halarious, yet true story...my roomie's hubby has put a personal ad in the yahoo pages...I died of laughter when she told me and it was much better when I saw it for myself!  What a freak!!!  He put this picture of himself in a lake...perhaps to hide the "few extra pounds" as he describes it.  I asked her if the fact he lives in his parents basement is a selling point!  Don't think he isn't creative...nope, he took his position as a manager of aquatics at the Y and twisted that to mean Executive Director or some sort of bullshit...hysterical!  And, no, he doesn't sugar coat the fact he had a wife and child yet got another woman pregnant...he admits it...yet another winning facet.  So, my roomie finally admitted she is dating one of our college friends.  She had casually mentioned him when she was here and I asked her about him...she thought I was psychic...lol.  I just told her I was good at reading into people and the fact she had mentioned him told me there was something to that...so, she is secretly dating him, it is complicated.  But he is a sweetie and I'm hoping it works out for her...she deserves a break!  The twitch is gone...for now!  I can't tell you how awesome it is not to have it twitching!  That's all I have time for now...

      wow...a whole hour without an eye twitch!  A miracle!!!  I swear it's from work...I don't know why...perhaps it is my peers bugging me to help make a quilt for the devil's baby...and being the only one with balls and integrity to say no.  I mean, I hate hypocrites...and wouldn't I be one if I did this?  I think so!  But, my posse has a good idea, tell them I've changed my mind and make one...with a BIG BLACK SHEEP!  HA!  Oh, I had it out with bf...well, if you could call it that.  I called her when I got home.  She was in the car with her hubby and kids, so I politely asked if now was a good time.  Well, we sat in silence until she asked why I was mad.  I told her I didn't understand her point to calling and bitching at me at work.  SHe flipped saying "I was so kidding!" I said, well, you said you were partly serious.  To which she went off about how I never call anymore, blah, blah blah.  I said it was hard to call and talk to someone who had no interest in what was going on with me and didn't have time to listen, just wanted to talk about what was going on with her.  She was offended, didn't expect her not to be.  She wanted me to explain my statements...so I recounted the million times I called and she would unleash her life story then turn around and say she had to go if I tried to talk.  She denies...big surprise.  So, I told her, you don't have a clue what is going on with my life, you don't ask, you aren't there when I try to talk...she thought I meant literally, so she told me to leave messages (umm, you don't have a machine!)...why must I deal with morons?!    Basically, it boils down to...she doesn't think I ever tried to talk, she isn't here so I can't expect her to be, and she needs me to blatantly ask for support...few issues, a)her hubby was in the background telling her what to say...you know what, dude? YOu don't have a clue what I'M saying so shut the fuck up...b)no shit you aren't here, I am not asking you to physically be here, and if you don't get that, well why are we having this discussion?!, c)halariously ironic...the next day, I got a cosmo girl magazine (don't ask!) and they had this article/blurb about friends...something to the effect, true friends are there for each other without being asked...okay, if teenagers get that, how did you lose that vital piece of 411!  To top it off, at the end of that, to which I just said, you obviously don't get where I am coming from, and I'm tired of talking about it...she asked, so what's been going on?  I laughed so hard I about wet myself...are you kidding me?!  I just told you, I don't tell you shit anymore because you aren't there...I have other people in my life who provide me with that...and yes, that means I am questioning why you are in my life, because, so far, all you do is use and steal... but I just found this funny...so, will I call her?  Why?  I don't call the people I do love and need...those who are there to support.  So before I call her lame ass, I think I will put back to those who have given to me...not stolen (sorry, I had to add that in there!)  Well, it was the day of sisters yesterday...big sis called...my bil is going to be a pastor!  Halarious!  I just find it so ironic...I don't know why, because, to those HCA jacks I wouldn't have been good enough to be related to a pastor!  Well, booyah!  Then, little sis called...she is in a black hole...and I feel really bad for her, not in a pity way, but because I really can identify with her situation...she misses her friends and wants to come home...I don't think I really helped, I tried to lead her through the logical reasons why she should NOT come...when you're emotional, you want to kill people like me...but, she has just seemed so happy...and who wouldn't be?  She got away, she is on the road to success.  I'm so skeptical of friends...so I don't think anyone should relocate just for friends.  I know the friends that I have are my friends no matter where I live and offer that support... I don't really know what to say to her, I just don't think what I said should have been it.  I hope she gets past the initial hurt and takes a step back to analyze.  Kzoo is not right for right now...and friends that would pressure you to change your life for them, aren't real friends.  Friends are supposed to support 110%...unless life threatening, or illegal (sometimes)!  So, not the type of friends I would relocate for.  But there lies a major difference between sis and I...at the end of the day, I truly don't give much of a rip what people think of me or what I do, she does.  Of course, I'm nuts anyway, so take my opinion with a grain of salt!

      Why, you ask, am I posting twice in the same week?  Because I am so not in the mood to work and I am stuck here until 2pm...ugh.  SO, I have read my email, my community board, a couple other sites, and now I'm here...I really don't even feel like talking, so I haven't replied yet to those emails (I WILL LISA!!!) nor did I post to the boards...I'm tired of talk.  I had the strangest, freakiest, nasty dream last night...I was a lesbian, which isn't exactly the nasty thing, freaky most definitely...but I was a lesbo with my bf, who is in questionable status.  And, we were trying to hide it from all of these Heritage people...for, duh, obvious reasons.  But then mr x came and I was fighting with bf so I wanted to be with him...I think something I ate right before bed does not agree with me!!!  So, to my dream last night, ew, don't come back!  Did I mention my roommate decided to divorce her hubby?  Good...he's a loser... Did I mention I have missed the past TWO weeks of Real World?  AND Newlyweds?    Thankfully, I have caught Newlyweds on re-runs...but where are the RW re-runs?  I really needed to see Leah get yelled at and CT go postal.  Don't get me wrong, I think Leah is gorgeous...I even forgive her that she is blonde.  I wonder what size she is...she looks larger than Mallory and Christina, but those two look like twigs.  Anyway...I went to Leah's site...wow...so hot!  And, she doesn't appear to goup herself up...I think she makes me laugh because she is so like my bf who thinks, I can walk into Gucci and give them shit because if I wanted that bag I would have it but choosing not to because I still like my model from last year better than this crappy version...watching Leah makes me appreciate myself...I'm sorry, it is hard to deal with people who like to be loud and obnoxious 24/7 and I DO think I should get a medal for hanging in there!  And CT?  He is so weird it is halarious!  Seriously, he is what I envision most caring guys to be like...trying to figure out the female population turns them neurotic...halarious!  But, we'll see if he gets kicked off because of his actions...they looked borderline on the preview and since no one believes in stepping in and stopping this shit before it goes down, so these people can be humiliated on public tv...whatever.  I mean, there have been very few times, but they have been there, where I want to take someone out back and beat them, to death...so, it happens to the best of us.  And, have you seen the crap he has put up with?  I would have killed someone, or at least verbally attacked them, a LONG time ago!  I give him credit for hanging in there...his roommates have been really mean and nasty to him...poor CT...  Wow...I really need to get a handle on watching reality tv...next thing you know Charla and I will be having coffee!  LOL...did I mention THAT...oh, Lord, that girl should feel like crap.  Paradise hotel...Keith decides to keep Charla and Dave.  All four (Tara is the other) must swap roommates for the vote.   So Charla and Keith win...and are given 250K and told they can either walk away with the check or split it with their "original" partner...they have 30min to decide.  Toni (UGH) hunts down Charla and convinces her NOT to give Dave the money...he doesn't deserve it, no one out there thinks he does, blah, blah, blah...didn't she watch the episodes?  Doesn't she get she would be doing herself a favor by SHUTTING UP?!  Anyway, Keith decides to give Tara half (I love him so much!) and Charla KEEPS IT ALL!  Last time I checked, you needed him and vice versa not to get kicked off!  Greedy, greedy!  At least she made up my mind for me...Tara I like better.  When Keith was telling her he was giving half of it, she was trying to convince him to keep it all for himself...what a friend.  Oh yeah, then Tara and Keith told everyone they were funding a trip for everyone to Vegas.  Now, I know this crap is pieced together...but there is no way I would have done that after the way they were treated...  Anyway...glad my life is so exciting I need to talk about TV!  There's junk to talk about, but I just don't wanna...maybe later...

      Wow...i love how everytime I log on, blogger looks different.  Makes me feel like I have been neglecting my blog!  What a funk I was in!  Not so bad anymore.  I think part of it has to do with shitty friends that won't leave me alone...and I must say, I am using the word friend very loosely!  My "friend" emailed me to see if I was having a Pampered Chef party anytime soon...I told her no, my mil can order if you want...well, lo and behold, she has started selling Mary Kay.  Why don't you just ball up and ask if I will have a party?  That's what kills me...you only want me around when you can use me, but you don't even have the guts to admit it.  Why don't I block her email???  Because I'm too nice and am a glutton for punishment!  Anyway...this weekend was good.  Skipped work Friday (seeing a theme?)...had a gyn appointment, though...so it wasn't all fun and games.  Anyway, talked to him to get his take on clomid.  He thinks we should give the metformin 6months to kick in.  He seems to think it will make everything return to normal, including ovulation.  Then, during the exam, he seemed to think I was ovulating or was primed to ovulate!  Hope restored!  Which, scares me, quite frankly.  I already have my hopes back up and what happens when it doesn't happen?  Anyway, he reassured me we most likely would NOT have multiples...so, that relaxed hubby.  Actually, hubby has been really cool.  He is very open to actively trying at the beginning of the year...or at least talking about it.  Which is a start!  I thought I would have to fight him tooth and nail to get him to that point!  But, I think he knows how much I want this, and that ultimately, we all want it.  And, we both agree, we are in such a better place than when we were pregnant the first time.  And, he knew it wasn't all coming up just because his brother and his wife are pregnant!  Got a couple closets cleaned out...the house if finally semi-clean again...and we can park in the garage finally!  Such accomplishments!

      wow...I love having a long weekend.  I basically left at noon on Wednesday, with nothing to do, there is only so much surfing one can take...so the rest of the day Wednesday and Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday...wow...going to work tomorrow is really going to suck...lol.  So, I decided NOT to knit...to give myself a real break.  It has been so nice.  I have read two books...watched some movies...taken naps...gone shopping...went to see Matrix on the IMAX...took B to see Brother Bear...  What a wonderful break.  It reminds me of the good old days when I was depressed and could just wrap up in covers all day long and never get up.  I miss those days.  I couldn't sleep at night, so I would sleep for about four hours and then get up and watch movies or read.  Okay, I did start knitting today, but other than that I have been good!  Do you ever have a friendship you think is really great and then you find out that it isn't?  Well, that happened to me.  My boss and I, I thought, were good friends.  I mean, he is really cool and really flexible with me and we joke around with each other, the guy gripes to me about his problems all the time and asks for advice...normal friend stuff.  Well, he has been working on making wood working stuff to sell at a craft show.  He had reserved a booth a while ago.  I started knitting these bags/purses and he asked me if I wanted to put them in his booth and sell them.  I didn't take him serious at first but then everyone started to tell me I should sell them...I figured, what do I have to lose?  So, I started making these bags to sell...last week, he says to me,  so what do I get out of all of this?   Understand, I thought he was kidding!  So I said, a thank you and a smile.  He said,  How about 10%?   I must have given him a Barto look because then he said,  okay, 5%?   I told him I would have to do the figures...but I don't get it...now you are trying to make money off of me???  Whatever!  I was so shocked at first...then hurt...now pissed.  What a jerk.  See, the thing is, he was supposed to sell his stuff at a store, well, he and I went out there and this guy that co-owned was really rude to him and basically told him no thanks.  Bill was so bummed about it, so on the way back to work, I told him to stop at this other store because I thought they sold wood working crap...and, sure enough, this guy is now interested in selling his stuff!  Ummm...you wouldn't have gotten that contact if it wasn't for me!  So what is MY kickback?  Then, in this same conversation, he wants to know if my friends that have the writing/graphic arts business will put together a business card for him...yeah right!  I told my friend and she cracked up!  I told her she should charge him at least double...ha!  So, it will be interesting to see if he brings it up tomorrow.  jackass.  Not much else is new...this week should be non-eventful...just trying to get things done in case I decide to do the craftshow...

      Okay...so can we say the holidays are a tad depressing?  My LORD!  I'm okay...really...just in a funk.   Hey, ladies...I'm just bummed so I need to spout off...don't mind me, LOL!   I think it is a yearly tradition for me to go into depression around B's birthday...what a great mom I am.  I just can't get past the desperate desire to have another baby...last week!  So, when Brennan's birthday comes, I feel like I am getting further away from the "ideal" timeline for two kids.  If it doesn't happen next year, I seriously don't know if we will still try.  And then, there is B.  At his party, my friends one year old was there tormenting him, so I though "whew, maybe he will stop asking for a sibling because of this"...ummm, wrong.  Last night we were on the couch reading a story ("Polar Express"), this child gets to choose the first present of the season...B says, I would say I want a baby sister.  I'm crying just thinking about it...he has gone from saying he wants one, to asking why we don't...and the best I can come up with is "because this is how God made our family".  I'm sure I must be so convincing.  My heart is breaking and I feel like his is too.   To top it off, my sister in law was at the party...she is 14 weeks along and of course that is all everyone wanted to talk about...I thought I had prepared myself for it...I didn't do a good job.  I couldn't even look at her when she came into the house.  Then my father in law said it was me and hubby's turn for another one, I just looked at him.  He said "I don't even get a response"...rather than burst into tears or rip his head off (or both! LOL) I just shook my head.  I think they forget they we, well I, have issues...   I would be angry...but I am too tired...I hate this, I hate PCOS, I hate it, hate it, hate it...I just want to curl up under the covers and hide.  I'm tired of being tired, I'm tired of not being able to sleep, I'm tired of not having a normal body, I'm tired of the aches and pains, I'm tired of the hair, I'm tired of the memory loss, I'm tired of the acne, I'm tired of the weight, I'm tired of the meds, I'm tired of people in my life forgetting...I'm just really really exhausted from all of this...and not convinced it will get better.    to top it all off I am freezing my butt off...well I guess that could be a good thing, lol...it is snowing here and I am cold...has anyone else noticed an unusual sensitivity to cold?  Literally, I used to be able to go throughout winter without wearing a coat...now I am sitting at my desk and I have yet to take my coat off...I'm cold!!!   I'm sorry if this was depressing...I'm fine, I'll be fine...I just have to try harder to find the silver lining and right now it is covered in snow...ha! Take care, dears~S

      ahhh...what a lovely weekend.  Halloween was nothing special.  B was Woody and we dressed Spike up as Buzz Lightyear...it was pretty funny.  Spike did not like the costume and came and hid his head in my arm, too cute!    We watched my parents dog...he pooped and pee'd throughout the main floor, I was ready to kill him by the time it was time to send him home...  My in laws came...boy was my mil in an exceptionally bitchy mood.  Oh, this was funny too...they are all telling me (Hubby's aunt, uncle, and grandma also came) how his sil has all these cravings and is oh so moody because of the pregnancy...ummm, hello?! She is only seven weeks along...HA!  Most people do not even KNOW they are pregnant at that time...except for those who are majorly trying...she also has gained four pounds.  Boy, I sure hope she continues to pack them on...to that, I would say KARMA.  But, anyways, I was so trying to keep my mouth shut, but I must have gotten a look.  My fil says, I keep trying to tell them this is all in their head, that it is too soon.  I just said, EXACTLY!  I can't wait to see if they come to B's party and if she is bitching about being pregnant then...ugh.  annoying...  anyway...my sis has gone mia again...oh, where are you?  I need to know about your couch so we can get it out of the garage and park inside again...BEFORE the snow!

      I love long weekends...especially, when Christmas is stuck in the middle!  I feel pretty spoiled this Christmas...some earrings, a ring, comfy pjs...a computer...and other stuff I don't remember at the moment...oh, yeah, the new Dido and Britney cds!!!  yippee!  anyway...the psychic...when I first entered and sat down, she said...wow, your aura is beautiful...what do you say to that?  She says...I can see that you have a very complete life...everything is balanced...you have such love in you that your heart is bursting...you love to laugh and love living...but, your angels are so sad...they are saying that you used to talk to them and consult with them and you have shut the door on them...they are so sad and wish that you would recognize that you are older and more able to handle the communication...they wish that you would trust them again and let them help you along...  Then she did like a generic reading...I should have written this earlier, but I didn't, so I'm just going to put what i remember and if it comes out, it comes out, otherwise I've forgotten a lot...  I will be traveling a lot this next year...I don't need to worry, finances will not be an issue...I will meet a tall man with dark hair and green eyes that will be my soulmate.  I will be having a change of job in the next 2-3 weeks and the people in my present position will offer glowing references...I will have a change of residence in 2-3 weeks but not to worry, it is for the best, and, again, finances will not be an issue, I will be better off...someone will try to take advantage of me financially, so beware!  I also need to be aware for the next 3-4 days as someone will try to steal from me (She said this is not uncommon to get that in the reading around the holiday)...travelling kept coming up...financial security kept coming up...the man I am supposed to meet kept coming up...so I finally asked if he was different than my husband...she said, yes, he appears as a stranger but someone you have a deep connection to, so he could be someone you don't know but connect with or someone you used to know or don't know very well...but you and your husband will not be together in 6-8weeks...there is a lack of communication and there will be lies and betrayal.  he loves you very much but you are independent and strong and the relationship will be ended...I asked about kids...I will not have any more, there will be a possibility in 10years, but by then I will feel it is too late...she says I need to remain friends with samantha...that I am very loving and giving to her, that I tolerate her personality when most people do not...it is not readily seen to me what benefit I receive from our friendship, but that I need to continue with it...  And, that is pretty much the gist of what was said...if I remember more, i will write it down...no, I didn't get stolen from, and so far, I still have the same job...but we will see...

      ahhh....what a weekend...  Just the highlight...  I went to see a psychic for the first time on Saturday...I was out with the black sheep and we wanted to go see Lord of the Rings.  However, since all the tickets were sold out, we had to come up with a backup plan...well, our backup plan was a psychic.  We went to a place downtown that my friend had called about...they had been there before and they were told that there would be a person reading, but there wasn't.  SO, we headed out to a place in Richland...I wasn't sure if I was going to go through with it...as I've said in previous blogs, past experiences have left me very freaked out about these kinds of things...I half believe they are true and I half believe they are a load of crap....but I agreed I would go along while the others had their reading and see what they thought and make up my mind at the last minute.  So, we go to this place and they have a big store as well...we arrive a half an hour early...and I'm getting ill from the incense...why does incense do that to me?  Instantly sick...it's weird.  So, we are walking around, I'm trying to mentally talk through the urge to vomit...and it is Cura's turn to go first.  Now, Cura and Shelly went to have a reading before...Kate had one a long time ago...so Cura comes down and it is Shelly's turn...I can tell Cura is emotionally moved.  So, I ask her what she was told...she was told by February she will be pregnant without having any assistance...Cura has tried so many fertility treatments...so, of course she was thrilled...she was told it would be a girl...Shelly comes down, she is not as moved...but she was told she was going to have either a new relationship or a new baby...to Shelly, that is bad news...but she also said she felt this woman was legit.  So, it's Kate's turn.  I decide, okay, what the heck, I'll do it...all the while, knowing what I would be told.  Mind you, we each are supposed to be getting 1/2hour tarot card readings...Kate is down in no more than 20 minutes.  Immediately, I could tell she was not happy, she breaks out in hives when she gets upset and she had hives and would not make eye contact with me...uh-oh...but it was my turn to go so I went...I will try to remember what she said, but it is in pieces, and not necessarily in the correct order...  So, after I was done, we left...I asked Kate what happened...she was also told she would be pregnant soon (she does NOT want to have babies) and that she and her husband would be splitting up...she said she got all bad news and was so pissed, she didn't care what the woman told her she just wanted it to be over...the weird thing, though, is that the woman said her aura was incomplete and asked her if she had a head injury or surgery on the back of her head...well, Kate was abused as a baby and the back of her head was fractured...weird...  Shelly was told she and gordon would stay together...if Kate and Steve and Scott and I are all breaking up how the hell is Shelly staying with her boyfriend???!!!  She was also told her and Cura were sisters in a previous life (I think she made that one up) and that she should go to law school and she would have her own firm...ummm, yeah...  Cura...was told Jeff needs to ask for more at work (he was just told he needs to be more assertive by his boss!!!)...Jeff is her perfect match....I can't remember what else...I think she was told her job would be changing soon...

       No cheating. Pick your dessert, then look to see what psychiatrists  think about you! After taking this dessert personality test, send this  e-mail on to others, but when you do, be sure to put YOUR choice of  dessert in the Subject box above.  ALSO, SEND IT TO THE PERSON WHO SENT IT TO YOU!   If you had your choice of those below, which would you choose?   1.. Angel food   2. Brownies   3. Lemon Meringue   4. Vanilla Cake with Chocolate Icing   5. Strawberry Short Cake   6. Chocolate on Chocolate   7. Ice Cream   8. Carrot Cake   NO ... You can't change your mind once you scroll down!  So think carefully, what your choice will be!   OK - Now that you've made your choice, this is what research says  about you!   Angel food ... Sweet, loving, cuddly. You love all warm and fuzzy items.  A little nutty at times. Sometimes you need an ice cream cone at the  end of the day. Others perceive you as being childlike and immature at times.   Brownies ... You are adventurous, love new ideas, are a champion of  underdogs and a slayer of dragons. When tempers flare up, you whip  out your saber. You are always the oddball with a unique sense of  humor and direction. You tend to be very loyal.   Lemon Meringue ... Smooth, sexy, & articulate with your hands, you are  an excellent after-dinner speaker and a good teacher. But don't try to  walk and chew gum at the same time. A bit of a diva at times, but you  have many friends.   Vanilla with Chocolate Icing ... Fun-loving, sassy, humorous. Not very  grounded in life; very indecisive and lack motivation. Everyone enjoys  being around you, but you are a practical joker. Others should be  cautious in making you mad. However, you are a friend for life.   Strawberry Short Cake ... Romantic, warm, loving. You care about other  people and can be counted on in a pinch. You tend to melt. You can be  overly emotional and annoying at times.   Chocolate on Chocolate ... Sexy, always ready to give and receive.  Very creative, adventurous, ambitious, and passionate. You have a cold  exterior but are warm on the inside. Not afraid to take chances.  Will  not settle for anything average in life. Love to laugh.   Ice Cream... You like sports, whether it be baseball, football, basketball, or soccer. If you could, you would like to participate, but you enjoy watching sports. You don't like to give up the remote control.  You tend to be self-centered and high maintenance.   Carrot Cake ... You are a very fun loving person, who likes to laugh.  You  are fun to be with. People like to hang out with you. You are a very warm hearted person and a little quirky at times. You have many loyal friends.    Guess what I am???  Chocolate on Chocolate...very fitting if you ask me!

       Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way....   it's Christmas time!!!  I'm so excited...well kind of...hubby does not have Christmas eve or Christmas off...BUT I get the 24th through 26th off, yippee!!!  Then, the following week, I have the 1st and 2nd off!!!  Plus, I have a couple half days in there because the sitter isn't working...woohoo!  I have just about all of my shopping done...just a few last minute details, which of course, include hubby.  He finally sat down last night to do a list for me, but it is all out of catalogs!!!  I told him I didn't know if that would work since it is so close, but we'll see...  Still no word from Sam...it is kind of funny actually...do I think she got the hint?  Maybe...I'm the queen of no confrontation...so I'm hoping I don't have to spell out the fact that I don't see how she can consider herself a friend, let a lone a best friend considering she STEALS and LIES...ugh.  This so takes me back to high school...it is annoying...  Speaking of which...B and I went to H's house this Sunday...this girl is nuts!  Her ex is getting married this coming year, so of course she is trying to get married BEFORE him...psycho.  To top it off, she is telling me all this drama she has in her life...like it is perfectly normal for an almost 30 year old to have so much drama, like she is back in jr high...she kept saying "now it isn't any of my business, but I said..."  Hello?!  Did you hear what you just said???  It ISN'T any of your business, so stop getting in the middle of every blessed thing...it is so strange that adults still feed off of drama...maybe it was the amount of drama I had in my "younger" days (ha!)...I had more than my share and now, I just try to stay out of everything...if someone asks my opinion, well, of course, I have one and I will give it to you, but I try to bite my tongue until someone asks...  anyway...better get back to work...not really...a friend called...lol!

      ahhh...another monday morning...I hate Mondays...especially when woken up at 4:30am because your hubby is yelling at your toddler and trying to put your toddler back to sleep in a wet bed.  Don't get me wrong, I love my hubby, but does he ever get it that he is the adult and he allows a four year old to get his goat?  It astounds me...  Anyway...alot going on...not sure where to start...oh, yeah...that computer I got...sucked major dookie...so I'm back with my old one...and ever more grateful for it...ha!    House projects: Hubby ripped down ceiling...I decided I wanted authentic tins.  Now, understand, spatial relations is not my thing.  So on eBay (I'm addicted, I will admit!) someone was selling tins...32 (12" each) for $105...cool!  That is cheap!  So I bought them and told the guy I would need enough for a 10x15 room.  Umm...that comes to $600 something!  And, it is closer to $700!!! HOLY SHIT!!!  I am so dead when hubby finds this out...so this month, overtime will be my middle name!!!  Britney:  Got tickets to see the concert...let's see if everyone follows through with paying me!  This is why I hate to be the one buying tickets...I can't stop thinking about it until everyone pays me...ugh...ocd at its finest!  Friend in TX: called me at work...after MONTHS...why, oh why did I have to be at my desk?!  She said she thought I was mad...I said I wasn't, I mean, that isn't a lie...I'm not mad, just done.  So she talked at me for a while...as usual.  Supposedly she was in the hospital for 10 days...I just don't believe her anymore...she has presents for me she is sending.  I have to laugh now...I must have sounded like a bitch...I didn't get her anything, and I have no intention to...so I just said, you shouldn't have...oh that is nice...etc...whatever.  So, I finally told her my boss needed to talk to me and hung up...no promise to call but I have a feeling she will never get it, you know?  At least that gives me time to decide if I am just being psycho or if I really should forget about her...  Hubby:  Inmate hung himself in his cell...god, it is awful...b and I had brought him dinner and that is when it happened.  He feels responsible and guilty but he is so confused...I'm praying he goes to see a counselor because there is only so much I can say...I don't know what he is going through and he is having a hard time opening up.  I don't think he really believes anything I say anyway...I just feel really bad for him...I hate to see him hurt like this...  Other than that...nothing...ha!  Our house is a disaster with the construction...I am praying by March it will all be done and be a faint nightmare...though, we may end up having to wait on the carpet if I keep spending all this money...I need a self-help group!!!

      I so hate stereotypes...really...do people realize how much they can hurt?  I have a couple friends that have "revealed" to me lately that when they first met me they thought I was a snob and conceeded...so, I asked why.  I know enough from my past that I need answers otherwise I will drive myself crazy as to why...well, supposedly it is because of how quiet I was and the fact that I dress nice...what?!  First off, being quiet is a curse...I'm shy.  People don't usually believe me, but it really is true.  Now, once I know you, no, I would not say that I am shy.  Reserved in what I reveal, yes, but shy, no.    Secondly, I dress nice?  What is that?!  At first glance, that may seem like a compliment and maybe it is in an off-color kind of way, but it is not really.  See, why should I be judged on what I wear?  I don't even think I particularly dress nicely.  Obviously, I suffer from self-consciousness so I wouldn't, but really...I know many other people who dress a LOT nicer than I do.  Anyway...plus, if they knew how I bought my clothes...you know those $3 shirts at Target that no one else wants...that's me!  I buy EVERYTHING on sale...literally, the most I have EVER spent on jeans was $30something dollars at the Gap.  The reason I spent that much was because a friend had sent me this awful pair as a present and I was exchanging them...so I could rationalize that it was not really my money I was wasting anyway.  Plus, name brands?  I have a couple...maybe two.  And I think both are name brand shoes!  One pair I just bought a couple months ago with my Christmas money (again, not really my money I'm wasting)...I bought some DKNY slip-ons at Marshall's (the TJ Maxx type store) and I think they were $30-35 dollars...so, not a whole lot was spent!  It took me two weeks to finally pull them out of the bag and wear them because I was so horrified I had spent so much on shoes.  Obviously, I have spent money on real tennis shoes but that is because of my bursitis.  The last time I had new tennis shoes was in college so my Nikes have lasted 5 years at least!  My shoe closet is filled with PayLess Shoes...so, yes, I have a ton of shoes but they were bought at PayLess and the majority of THOSE were clearanced!!!  I don't know why this hurts my feelings...I guess because last time I checked I didn't realize it wasn't "cool" to look nice and I thought I am supposed to take care of myself.  Oh, yeah...this girl also mentioned that I am always getting my hair done...to which I replied, I have NO idea what you are talking about because the last haircut I got was LAST summer...I have dyed my OWN hair with $7 dye that you too can go to Rite Aid and buy!  Oh, yeah, plus I cut myself some nasty-ass bangs this fall...whatever!  I guess I don't see myself as materialistic...my parents, yeah...that was how they loved us...you are upset about something, here go buy a shirt...but both of these people are saying that this was their first impression of me...again, if materialistic means you want things to look nice, than, yeah, I'll admit to it...but I want things to look nice at a fraction of the cost...what a commercial!    Anyway...lol, my non-materialistic self got my bday present from hubby...it is a .50cttw princess cut anniversary band...but, in my defense, it was bought from eBay so we got a super great price...plus, I think it is every present for this entire year...lol...

      wow...no wonder it seems like a long time, it has been a long time!  I am officially fighting depression again...I have been so happy on met, it seems to help with a lot of things.  The hair has been falling out more slowly, the extra hair has been growing not so fast, and the mood swings seem to have evened out.  I should be thankful to be where I am at...it used to be about once a week I would wake up and not be able to motivate myself to get out of bed...literally.  I would lie there absolutely incapable of moving.  It was not good.  There was no rhyme or reason and really nothing that I could pinpoint triggering it to come upon me or to lift...now, of course, I realize it was my hormones and body being so absolutely out of order but back then, I thought it was me and that I was the biggest of all losers...the weight thing hasn't really been helped with the met, but I haven't applied myself either.  The memory thing is still shot to hell but the results I have gotten, I couldn't be happier with...well, here I am again, fighting depression.    Don't get me wrong, I know it could still be the hormones...but it could also be my life.  I mean, after what happened to hubby at work, I was so freaked out and concerned for him...my body can handle like zero stress...my brain literally gets fried, I get exhausted, and I just can't handle it.  It is so strange because I used to be such a stressed out junkie...I lived on stress...now, the new reality is that I can't give a shit about a lot of stuff that I probably should because I will get a headache, get exhausted, or just get physically ill.  Anyway, between hubby's job, my work, etc...things have been stressful for us.    So, yesterday at work, I had a meeting that did not go so well...no particular reason, just one of my peers was laid off and yet we are reassured not to be concerned for our jobs...yeah...also, I have had mad reports to get done that get confusing and so indepth it is hard for me to focus...so after a day of that, I am greeted with my hubby and son, son is sick, hubby is pissed at son, so that sets me off...I try to gently remind hubby he is the adult and he is letting a FOUR year old get the best of him...of course, he gets pissed at me then...so all this is adding up, I get home and have a terrible headache, which turns into a migraine...well, b has awana so I can't take the meds that I can't find anyway...so I take him to church, can't bring myself to go up to the bathroom to search for the meds, so I lay on the couch and konk out...well, I never heard the doorbell and pounding when my dad brought b home, so who knows how long they were out there...got him to bed and then I am wide awake, with a migraine, and now the nausea has set in...so, I stay up for another two hours wishing I could make myself upchuck...I wanted to die, I felt so miserable...finally, I find some flat coke to drink (pop, not drug) force some down my throat and truck it up to bed...thankfully, the headache is GONE today, just the nausea remains.  All this to say...I can't deal with stress...I'm just tired of being physically exhausted.  Thankfully, hubby says a lot less when I tell him I must lay down...but it is still hard.  Until you have dealt with exhaustion, please don't tell me that you know how I feel...I'm wishing for the days where I was just tired...I'm talking about fatigue, exhaustion...as in, I have to motivate myself to move every muscle in my body...even typing this shit is wearing me out...not just mind tired, soul, body, spirit tired...

      Okay...I'm having blog issues!  I re-wrote (which I hate!) an entry because it didn't show as published.  When I look at it through blogger, both showed up, so I deleted the one that was a re-write.  But when I type in my actually address neither show up!  Then I click on current posts and they both show up!  This is the point at which I wish I knew what I was doing...I'm so lost!

      I'm so bored...I hate being bored...but at least I'm getting paid to be bored...right???  I don't know...BUT since I have nothing better to do and I've visited most of my regular online haunts, I decided to start reading the "most recently updated" blogs...some of that is SCARY but some of it is really cool!  The funny thing is, I hate responding to people's blogs...I feel like I'm infringing, even though I have been wanting to get comments up so I can know if someone is reading mine.  Psycho.  But someone had a halarious posting about people who talk during movies/tv...that is SO me!  Hubby and I fight all the time about this because he will ask me what just happened, then again, and again because he keeps asking me to explain, therefore missing even more...just SHUT UP until commercial!  Plus, keep in mind that because I think I'm going deaf I am usually watching (movies) with the subtitles at the bottom...I can't read the subtitles and explain to you at the same time!!!  Anyway, I responded and told her I was so with her...  Blogger...why can't I ever be on "most recently updated" blog list?  I think this is soon going to become an obsession of mine...I like to see my name in lights, I must admit...ohhh, I'm mad now...I forgot to tell Lis how dorky her older sis really is!  See, I am a rw/rr junky...and I had to report an Abe sighting to my rr/rw site...http://www.therealworldroad.cjb.net/  Well, they thanked me on their website but now I can't get past their most recent bloggings to find what the date was.  It must have been sometime this month, last month at the latest.  If you find out the date, let me know...  So, I mentioned Britney to K.  She laughed and told me she would check her calendar.  Which basically means, do I have to?  I'm not letting her off that easy!  I'll bring it up to her later this week and see what she says...I just want to get rid of my ticket!

      I'm so glad that worked!  Anyway...so sis can't make it to the Britney Spears concert...my other friend who is going with us had bugged and begged for her ticket, so when Lis couldn't make it, I told her she could buy it...well, now she is backtracking and saying she "doesn't know" if she wants it or not...ummm, the concert is in two weeks!  I think I'm just being bitchy but I kinda need to know so I can figure out who else to sell it to!  Thing is, until I have it unloaded on someone else, I am going to sit here and worry about it...I'm so weird when it comes to this kind of stuff...ocd.  So, I called her today to "talk" hoping she would mention if she wanted it or not...she didn't.  Well, i'm going out to lunch with a potential buyer, so I am just going to ask her if she wants to go with me...if she does, awesome!  If not, keeping my fingers crossed Red will...but if she wants to go and Red decides she wants the ticket...fuck me...but I'm not going to get screwed with an extra ticket because she can't make up her mind...see???  Obsessive...I'm trying to rationalize and figure this all out and it is driving me nuts!  The bigger question is...why does a 27year old feel the need to go to this concert anyways?  LOL...

      HA!  I love it when can actually get some stuff to work!  Of course, it isn't really my mind figuring stuff out, just my fingers typing in the right questions and finding it...I FINALLY have comments...I have been blogging for 2+ years and JUST found it!  Yippee!  So, leave a comment...or two!  Hubby thought he was in hell this weekend...I made him help me clean out all the closets.  It feels like a huge burden has been lifted off my shoulders because they are all (okay, one is left) organized.  I know, I need help.  I don't quite know why I have this insane need for complete organization in hidden places...most people think if there is a door to close on it, who cares?  Not me...it is like this unrelenting thought that I have constantly telling me that my closets are in disarray...no more!  Well, it will last at least a month...  Other than that...it was 70 outside yesterday!  Unbelievable...so B and I went outside for a few hours.  I got to clean out the gardens and revel in the fact that the plants survived and are starting to come out.  Friday B and I went outside and had a mini celebration over our first flower of the season, a crocus.  It was so small but so proud, the overachiever of the bunch.  Of course, I got B to get ecstatic with me...hubby thinks I am nuts and passing it down to B...ha!  Purplepanda is gone...it is so weird, we are so off and on with contact...but of all my sisters, she is the one most like me...I miss her, just knowing she isn't 20minutes away...but, alas, she will be traveling the country getting paid for it!  I envy her and I hope she is able to enjoy it...she deserves to have a fulfilling life and I hope this gives her it...

      man...they are always changing things up around here...you know what I wish they would do?  Get better blog templates...dude, I don't know how to do this stuff, that's why I come to you!  You are cramping my style but forcing me to use these boring templates...oh, well, you can't complain about free, right?  Anyway...still no change here...haven't heard from the inlaws, supposedly hubby intends to call them this weekend...I feel myself getting sick!  We will see how it goes but he keeps telling me I need to prepare myself that nothing is going to be resolved.  Sam's not pregnant, supposedly she is having a miscarriage...  i'm being too bitchy...I need to stop blogging...

      lordy...when it rains it pours...I have not slept through the night since Thursday and my colon is kicking into high gear.  It is really quite frustrating and I am trying to keep light hearted about all of this, but I just seem to be getting more and more stressed.  To top it off, my internet is not working quite right today, it is taking FOREVER for pages to load and sometimes they just don't...ugh.  Anyway...let's see if my tired mind can recount the important highlights of the reception...first, we arrive 20minutes late thinking my parents will be there by then and I won't be forced to mingle...wrong-o.  Not there, hubby has to use the bathroom, I'm there trying not to vomit so I run into the bathroom.  I'm half tempted to call Sam but realize that is nuts so I am trying to use positive self-talk as I'm staring at myself in the mirror while washing my hands.  Ummm, wouldn't you know I start breaking into hives around the base of my neck!  Unbelievable.  Old "friend" Keri...got engaged, her fiance is almost 10years older than her and works at HCA.  Doesn't make enough money to cover bills so he has to work a second job on the weekend...her stone is so tiny it isn't worth having and she is visibly uncomfortable because she keeps folding her hand under her arms...she is only having a cake reception.  As Sam said, if she is having so many people, the least she could do for all the presents she will be getting is throw people a pig-in-a-blanket...ha!  BTW...I'm tired of using initials...  Abe...he and I make eye contact...he smiles, I look away...  My parents get there, they immediately start mingling with the enemy...hubby and I go check out the wedding pictures.  My parents pick a table right next to the enemy!  My parents have to leave because my mom has work to do...hubby and I relocate to the other side of the table because I have been facing the wall the whole time...Jim comes up to talk to us (goes on and on about how many girls he has swarming to date him...yeah, whatever).  Gives me a hard time about the nose ring and church...both of which I make obvious are not up for discussion with him and I couldn't give a rat's ass what he thinks...meanwhile, Abe comes up to sit down with us (oh, I forgot, Jim told me Missy has a baby) and Jim immediately has to get up to go attend to something else...I would have laughed except now I'm stuck with him!  Hubby goes up to get cake...Abe starts small talking and mentions how much he likes the nose ring and thinks it's cool...I roll my eyes as I am used to people just saying that...he says, no really...I think it is sexy when girls have their noses pierced...actually, you should watch out because I have a thing for girls with their noses pierced.  To which, I look dead in his eyes with a straight face, you do realize that was my husband that just went up to get cake.  he says, oh I'm just kidding...yeah, whatever, don't flirt with me.  So, he and I are talking about his house and his wife comes up...Scott comes back with cake and Abe's wife makes a big deal about it being chocolate (oh, yeah, both she and Abe got TWO pieces, for themselves!  WT) and my hubby, being gracious, offers to switch with her...after this whole fiasco, Abe says, have you been introduced? He introduces me as Sara Barto, to which I say, actually Sara H and then Scott.  Never tells us her name (of course, I know who she is!) so I say, I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name...ha!  I'm just being bitchy...Corey Nichols.  Anyway, hubby tells me after we leave that I must intimidate Abe.  All during our short little conversation he was totally downplaying everything.  His house (it's just a house) and his job (it pays the bills, it isn't anything big)...etc...never mentions they are pregnant and of course I don't let on that I know...I can't say that I didn't enjoy this...like Sam said, it was very therapeutic to know that even if I'm living in a cardboard box I have more class than all of them put together.  Corey...so NOT attractive...as hubby put it...from far away she looks attractive...up close, bad news!  She has facial scarring (acne?) and has this dorky haircut that is a  bad  old school Deborah Barrone.  Bad fashion sense, bad makeup application skills...the whole package is just wrong.  Again, her rock was too small to be worth having.  Plus, her and Abe have these really ugly sterling silver engraved rings.  The only thing I could think of was that they are the Hebrew engraved "I am my beloved's and my beloved is mine" rings...  All in all, it was therapeutic to go...why should these people be able to make me feel small again?  I have gone beyond the tangled in-bred web they all spin together...I escaped years ago...it will be interesting to go to Keri's wedding (if we are invited)...  Didn't get to say more than hi and congratulations to Tom...oh well, I tried...  Sam called today and told me she is pregnant...this is weird.  She told me at the end of the summer that she and Mustafah would start trying later this year...but today she told me they never have used bc.  Whatever, I don't give a shit anymore, lie, don't lie...I'm too stressed out to even have a reaction, which is probably a good thing!  oh, yeah...Britney got cancelled...

      what a fucking weekend...I'm so tired of talking about it but feel I like I should rehash this to have it for memory sake...it's beautiful, who would want to forget?  RIIIIIGHT....  Anyway...the inlaws refused to return hubby's calls on Friday, so basically he and I got no sleep and I was sick all night.  Saturday morning both of us were looking and feeling like HELL...so I asked him to please just call again and try to get it over with...so, as he is trying to dial through our calling card, the phone beeps and it is his mom.  Let me preface this by saying, for quite a few months, hubby has wanted me to seriously go get my hearing checked...so we feel like I could be starting to lose my hearing...I was across the kitchen and could hear her sobbing and yelling at Scott...I really can't remember how it exactly went but the gist was: you should have called Sara was out of line to do so AND if I said such a comment, you should have known that I didn't say it to hurt you...so, is that supposed to release you from the responsibility of your words?  I DON"T THINK SO!  Hubby explained to her we had decided as a couple to have me call and we do not think there is anything wrong.  Blah, blah, blah...she wasn't listening and she didn't really care.  All she wanted was for him to concede with her opinions, but he didn't so she hung up on him...yeah, I know, but she really is older than jr high!  He and I talked for about 3hours...it basically boils down to, I have been right for the last five years, they don't want a relationship with me, I'm merely unfortunate baggage that comes with my hubby and son.  I'm done, no more mentioning we should go up there, no more bringing up that they should be invited to come down...I will put out as much effort as you do, which is none.  All of sudden my calendar is wide open!  What a weight gone from my shoulders...  Anyway...he talked to bil on Saturday night (no, parents never called back!) and told him...the thing that makes me most upset is that people are so concerned with getting right with mom and checking on her hurt feelings (for something she has done) that they haven't stopped to think about how my wife is feeling...she hasn't slept all weekend, she is physically ill, and she is crushed that they are basically telling her they don't want a relationship with her...  No resolution...my bil went and talked to them yesterday about it, they stand firm on their ground I shouldn't have called it should have come from hubby...hubby will call some time this week but he isn't in a rush to do it...they will have to agree to disagree there is not other solution.  I will be very proud if he actually tells him what he told his brother...I'm so proud he has taken his balls back from his mom...  more to tell...I have the whole reception story to recount...but I need to go pick up my car...$530 for brakes and a rotor...ugh!

      rats...I was trying to take a break from this to read email...I hate spam!  So, basically, I relayed this all to hubby.  He got home extremely late and I was starting to panic that she had called him first...you see, there were times in the past where, when faced with choosing sides, I was on the losing end.  Basically, four years of our marriage was that way...so, I'm a little paranoid when it comes to that.  No, she hadn't called, he was just busy at work.  I relayed to him how I felt.  My feelings are really hurt that she refuses to talk to me about this and that she basically told me I am blowing this out of proportion.  I also told him that she tried to manipulate me with tears.  He completely disagrees.  I tried to explain that women use this technique all the time.  If someone can turn them on and then turn them right back off, that is a pretty clear indication they are trying to manipulate you.  I think we agreed to disagree because I think he thinks I'm nuts.  Oh, yeah...I forgot the other part.  The day I had this conversation?  THURSDAY.  Which means hubby was going to be at home the next night...duh!  I'm  so tired of parts of my brain not participating in group activities!  Therefore, because I left a lot of room open to confuse my mil, hubby would now have to be the one to call...doh!  Anyway...everything peachy?  Not really...my spastic colon is in full force..I have spent the better part of the last 48 hours in a bathroom...Thursday night I think I got a total of 1 1/2 hours of sleep...all I can think about it the fact this is all going to be blamed on me...  So, enter Friday morning...hubby gets a call from his brother.  Wondering what happened and what the conversation was...I think.  See, by this time, hubby has become very elusive with me.  He won't really answer questions and won't give a rundown of what is being said.  The basics he told me...brother says this is not the comment that was made the comment was more "They were in a different financial situation than you are, if you would prefer to have something else, let us know."  Which, at first, holy crap!  That changes things...but as my good friend Kate pointed out, it is still the same thing.  Yup, you're right it is...it sounds more pc but its the same...just wrapped prettier...bil also said that fil had called him in the morning to ask him what scott's mental and emotional well-being had been last time they talked and that I had called and chewed my mil's ass.  He also said that he had had a long chat with M and that we should not read much into what she says because she is pregnant.    There are SOOOO many issues I have with this...did I miss the part where being pregnant effects your brain and mouth?  Don't give me that bs...I was once pregnant too!  To which hubby says, I don't remember you being like that before you were pregnant but you were like that after...yup, you are right...and if you wouldn't have interrupted me, that is EXACTLY what I was going to say...but through it all?  I knew what I was saying and I didn't blow things out of proportion and blame it on pregnancy!  (Side note...we now know the reason I was so emotionally unstable after b was due to my PCOS...which they are JUST NOW taking care of...so back off...)  Also, and the biggest one...I CHEWED HER ASS????!!!!  Trust me, if you are about to get your ass chewed by me, you will know it when I am done that this is what just happened...NEVER did I raise my voice.  But, when I mentioned this to my mom, she had a good point...mil lies and manipulates, we know this just from the conversation the previous night...so what would stop her from lying and manipulating the ears she is bending?  And, since B was in bed and I was alone, it is my word against hers and we all know who's the loser in that situation.  Hubby claims bil never shed his opinion on the whole matter...he didn't say who's side he is taking...okay, but at the same time, he is sayiing it is my fault that I took to heart what M said, I should have known better...so isn't that saying he thinks I'm at fault for this?  Add to that his comment to hubby that he thinks mil is abusing her drugs and that plays a part...okay, so everyone else has an excuse and the one left standing without the excuse is the loser?  Wow...everything really can be pointed back to me.  I tried to explain to hubby...this woman had a chance to explain.  I point blank asked her twice what exactly the comment was but she chose not to answer.  RIGHT THERE she shows that she does not deem me good enough to carry on conversation or relationship...obviously, she knew then this was not the comment she made, why didn't she tell me what she had said?  IT WOULD HAVE ENDED THE CONVERSATION.  You know why I think?  Because I think SHE knows that what she meant is what I was told she said...I think she knows that the real comment she made IS the same thing and it is the same thing because she MEANT it as such.    I am not going to try to make excuses...you are an adult, own up to your comment.  Do I need to make an excuse for being hurt by you?  Last time I checked, it is the person's responsibility who does the hurting, not vice versa.  If the comment wasn't made, sure, that changes the hurt associated with the comment...but after our conversation, there is new hurt...hurt that you have confirmed what the last five years have been about...you don't like me, you don't want a relationship with me, and you wish I would just go away.  I'm so sick...I'm trying to figure out what went wrong...what did I do wrong that caused this woman to hate me so much?  If I can accept you and try to love you because of who you are to the two most important people in my life...why can't you?  I really feel like running away and not leaving a forwarding address.  I asked my hubby what his stand is on this and what Jason's stand is...he said it doesn't really matter what either of their opinions are...like hell!  I have put up with five years of your family thinking the worst of me...five years of their manipulations, hurtful digs, and their obvious dislike of me...WHY would I care what they think?  I know what they think...you are the only person out of this whole mess that I care about...it is ONLY important to me that you believe what I am saying.  "Well, you're the one I have to live with, of course, I'm going to believe you..."  Well, that doesn't sound good to me...believe me because you believe me, not because you HAVE to live with me.  If you don't believe me, I would rather know that...I don't want you throwing misguided belief.  YOU KNOW ME...are you telling me you really think after five years of hell with your mother I took this opportunity to give her the smack down?  I am so different than I used to be, maybe a year ago, I would have...but not now.  What the hell would that solve?  So, apparently, you don't know me as well as you should either...you too think the worst of me but aren't going to admit that to your family because that is your duty as my husband...  So, all of yesterday, he tried to get ahold of them and couldn't...do I think this was on purpose?  Probably.  I want to talk to dad, I want to talk to bil...I want to simply tell them, look, Scott and I reacted to what we were told...I was trying to clear up what happened.  I would hope you would realize that I tried to use the utmost respect and never was there a point where I yelled at her.    It probably won't happen...hubby expects fil to call and yell...why?  I was an adult...I didn't yell...you are an adult, you deserve the respect of not being yelled at...  gotta go...about to be sick...

      okay...I'm back...  I call sil back.  Hubby and i both agree, there is a possibility that mil never made this comment.  Let's give sil one more chance to back away from what she told me before I call mil.  Nope, she said she understood why we wanted to talk to her and it was okay with her.  I apologized if this would get her in trouble but M NEVER changed what the comment was or put a new spin on it.  so, I prepare to make the call...  my fil answers the phone...I small talk with him for no more than five minutes and ask for mom.  She gets on the phone and I ask her if she has a few minutes.  She says sure.  I say "I'm calling because we were informed of a comment you made.  We were told you are telling people the reason you buy us gifts is because we cannot afford them."  MIL"I don't know what you are talking about."  Okay, so my tactic of being elusive is not going to work.  I did not want to come right out and say who said what but it was appearing as though I had no choice.    "Mom, I was told that you are telling people the reason you and dad bought us the crib was because we couldn't afford to buy it." "I don't think I said that." "So, you don't think you told people you bought us the crib because we couldn't afford it?" "I don't think I said it like THAT." "How might it have been said then?" LOOOOONG PAUSE "Mom?  What do you think was said then?" "Did Gary tell you this?" "No, Gary did not tell us this..." "It must have been Jason then" "Mom, it doesn't matter who told us..." "Even if I did say it like that, what does it matter?  That was four years ago." "Mom, do you understand why we would be hurt by a comment like this?" LOOONG PAUSE "Mom, do you understand that it is Scott's privilige and responsibility to take care of this family?...and you are basically telling people that he cannot fulfill this responsibility." LOOONG PAUSE "I think this is being blown out of proportion." "So, you are saying you can't understand why we might be upset about this?" nothing...long pause....lasting probably 5minutes...the pause had gotten so long, I turned around to look at the clock and it was an additional 3 minutes... "Mom?" "What?" "You can't understand why Scott would be upset about this?" Enter sniveling..."so you don't want me to buy brennan anything anymore?"   Okay...side note...I am trying to recreate but cannot EXACTLY remember the sequence of everything being said...this is a RECREATION.  Please note, already, I have explained to her we appreciate everything she and dad have done for the family.   "No, mom, that isn't what I'm saying.  We understand buying things is a normal "grandparent" behavior.  But when you tell people you are buying us things because we cannot afford it, that changes the motivation behind giving and, yes, that would change our view.  We feel like you are telling people we are taking handouts which is not, nor has it ever been the case.  We thought you bought us the crib because you wanted to.  And if you felt like you had to, let me reassure you, we did not then and we don't now, need handouts.  We are okay...we were okay then, we are okay now, and we will continue being okay." "You guys didn't have a lot of money back then...we wanted to buy that for B because he was our first grandson." "I admit things were tight then, mom, but it never came to a point where we needed to ask anybody to hand us anything.  We have always thought the reason you bought us the crib was because you wanted to."   LOOOOOOONG pauses taking place...really, it wasn't very often that she would actually answer my question, she usually made me repeat the question before she would acknowledge it....   "I don't understand what the big deal is...I don't thin this is coming from Scott." "Mom, do you think I am blowing this out of proportion?" "I didn't raise my son to think like this." "Mom, do you think I am making this up?  The reason I am calling is because Scott is very busy at work.  If you think that he doesn't feel this way as well, please feel free to call him.  Tonight is probably not a good time but I am sure he is more than willing to discuss this with you." "I did not raise my son to think of his mother like this." "Mom, this does not change our opinion of you.  We still love you.  Scott and I had a long conversation before I called you.  Let me assure you, we are a unit, we both feel the same way." "This is just being blown way out of proportion." "I don't know how to explain it to you any differently.  Maybe ask dad how he would feel.  You have to understand that a man's pride is wrapped up in how well he provides for his family.  I think we can all agree, Scott does a wonderful job doing this and busts his ass to do so."   okay...I had made this comment previously...I also made mention of the fact that both he and I had made a lot of sacrifices to be where we are at...and it was hurtful for someone to belittle that by making such a comment.  I also, at some point, mentioned that just because they handle their finances differently than we handle ours does not make their way right and our way wrong.  It makes their way right for their family and our way right for ours.     "We HAD to accept things from dad's parents.  We were broke and there were many times they gave us money or groceries to help us survive.  There is nothing wrong with that!  We were very thankful for that and knew we wouldn't have gotten by without them!  There were a lot of times they would hand us a $100 bill so we could buy food or gifts for Christmas." "Okay, you're right, but that is different.  There has never been a point where we needed that." "this is being blown out of proportion." "Again, mom.  Are you saying you think I am blowing this out of proportion?"   To which she goes off on a tangent...for the life of me, I wish I could remember what it was.  All I could think about was the fact she hadn't answered my question and this was probably a pretty important question to have answered.   "Mom, you still didn't answer my question.  Do you think I am the one who is blowing this out of proportion?" "I don't know."   Well, I think I do know...anyone I know would read this as a YES.   "I am just going to wait and talk to Scott about this." "Okay mom, that is fine.  But is there a reason you can't finish talking to me about it?" "I just want to talk to Scott." "I hope you know you are free to say anything to me that you need to say to him." "I'll just talk to Scott, tell him to call me tomorrow after I get out of work." "Scott knows what I was going to be saying, mom.  If you need to talk to him, why don't you give him a call at work tomorrow." "Fine." "I'll tell him to expect your call." LOOOONG Pause "I really wasn't expecting there not to be resolution to this tonight, mom." Nothing "You are the mother of my husband, the grandmother of my son.  We are going to be in each other's lives a very long time.  We need to learn how to resolve conflict with each other.  ~pause~  That's what people in relationships do." "Just have Scott call me." "I think you should call him.  He has been pretty busy at work and it would probably be better if you called him." "Fine." "I hope in the future you will be willing to talk and resolve conflict with me." "Okay, bye" "Bye"   I don't really remember if this is truly the point at which I made the comment about mother of husband, etc...also, throughout the whole conversation, I thought I handled myself spectacularly!  No yelling, no name calling.  I had successfully channeled the calm cool lawyer act.  However, the one flaw I find is that I allowed her to get my goat about having hubby call her.  Why?  I'm not sure.  Probably because I was so extremely hurt and upset that she refused to have a real conversation with me.  It was unnerving with all of her dramatic pauses and offensive that she wouldn't answer me.  We spent probably 30-45 minutes on the phone and maybe 10-15 of it actually talking (maybe 20).  Add on top of that, she basically accused me of blowing this out of proportion and making this up...how hurtful is that?  For five years you have given me hell...my hubby has been defending YOU telling me it is all in MY head.  For five years, I have been trying to convince myself of that and you just confirmed every demon in my head....you don't like me, you don't want to like me.  So, of the whole conversation, one bad choice.  I wasn't disrespectful, but it was definitely a pissing match.

      never has the title of my blog been more appropriate...life has gone from boring, monotonous, and relatively stress-free to full blown crazy nightmare...oh what a difference 24hours makes!  Before I delve into this, please note the time...why is it on the weekdays I cannot pull myself out of bed by this time but on the weekend I can't sleep late???  Crazy hormones!  Okay...I have been trying to vent to everyone else and it hasn't helped...so, as I was laying in bed trying to sleep, I realized I had not written this down...why does writing help clear the mind so well?  I'm not sure, but I know I need some clarity because right now I just feel like I am in a psycho thriller...  Let's give some backup....of course, no thriller would be complete without the overbearing inlaw. MIL to be exact.  Hubby and I going on cruise in July.  What to do with B?  There really was no consideration for his parents to take him, neither of us felt comfortable with them having him for a whole week...besides, that would mean we are asking them to take a week off work...my mom is a teacher, we trust my parents with B wholeheartedly, logic says, let them watch him...exactly the reason why we are waiting until July instead of going on our anniversary in June, my mom will be out of school and available... Last time il's were here, mil asked what we were doing with B.  I told her my parents would have him, I had told hubby after they left, this is not the last time we hear about this...I could tell by mil reaction she was not happy.  Enter this past Sunday...mil COINCIDENTALLY has the exact same week of our cruise off of work.  WHAT?!  Do you truly expect me to believe that?  I told hubby the only way I would believe that is if that was the week of the Cherry Festival.  That is the week she ALWAYS takes off!  Nope, Cherry Festival is the previous week...so she mentions to hubby, well if things don't work out, we will be available...or at least we could split the week, half with us, half with them.  Hubby tells her he will mention it to me but that are plans have been set for QUITE some time.    Hubby turns 30 this year, mil always has issue with us because we do not feel the need to make a trip to TC for his bday...if you want to see him on his bday, get your ass down here!  Enter pregnant sil...she has to have a shower thrown by mil side of the family, enter mil plot to get hubby up there for his bday...LOW AND BEHOLD she tells hubby 4/24 is the ONLY day that works for sil to have a shower...uhhhh, right!    Please understand...if you want me to do something, I approve the direct approach...ask me!  Manipulation is a pet peeve of mine...I tend to (read ALMOST ALWAYS) flee to the other extreme of what you are asking...I HATE and DESPISE manipulation and I do the opposite to prove a point to you that I will not be manipulated!  SO...knowing how my mil is, I decide, okay, so the shower is on the 24th...this entire past year has been spent being left out of occassions like this because my mil is mad at me and doesn't "allow" invites to be sent to me...why do I need to go up there for the shower?  Hubby and I have tenative plans, a party or going away, for his birthday...I am not going to choose a baby shower over that.  I decide the best person to deal with is sil...it is her shower, it is her feelings that are potentially going to be hurt, I need to take it up with her.  I call her to tell her that I potentially will not make this shower but is there an alternative one I can attend?  Start talking to M.  Tell her, mil told hubby this is the date of your shower, blah, blah, blah...well, humorously, M had told mil on Monday that this would not work.  Apparently, I had mentioned to bil that we were either going away or there was going to be a party so he knew we already had plans.  In addition, one of M's other friends is having a shower that day.  Whew!  M and I started talking about how we were both well aware why "coincidentally" she wanted the shower that day.  M mentioned that she is hurt and frustrated because she is being used as a tool of manipulation when it, rightfully so, should be all about her.  That gets her talking about other crap that has been going on...mil is getting new vehicle, she bitched to hubby that she was mad at fil because he won't let her get the car she wants.  Why would you tell your son this?  Take it up with your hubby, not your son!  I tell M how weird I thought that was and how I had told hubby that it is really out of line...M tells me the reason mil wants that car is because her twin has the same model and this one was a step up from hers...whatever!  M goes on to say that mil is also mad because fil won't "allow" her to give hubby and I her blazer.  I guess I never realized I wanted it!  I guess mil has been telling people that she would feel "so much better" if hubby and I had a reliable and safe vehicle to be driving...our vehicles are just fine bitch.  Enter comment two...I am upset about the previous and tell M this.  M says, oh you don't know the half of it.  Proceeds to tell me that mil came to them and said, and I'm quoting what I was told, which I was told was a quote... "We bought s and s a crib for b because they couldn't afford it, BUT if you would like us to do the same for you, we would go ahead and do that"   EXCUSE ME???  That got my redhot Italian temper BOILING!  Yes, things were tight when hubby and I first got married, but there was never a time where we couldn't buy what we needed...ESPECIALLY when it came to b!  Our whole life together has been about sacrificing ourselves for the best of B...that includes sacrificing the better of our marriage!  So, don't go telling people that we could not live up to our responsibility and you were the white knight that had to save us!  I called hubby at work to tell him...I mean, I was beyond angry.  He got MAD.  He said as far as he was concerned, if that is why they buy us things, they can come and take everything back...anyway, we have a lengthy conversation, in which I offer to talk to her, thinking that she is not going to try to manipulate me because she knows better and maybe I can get through to her LEAVE US OUT OF YOUR CONVERSATION!  So, I get B to bed and make the call.  Please understand...my mom is Italian, my dad is a lawyer.  I admit 99% of the time, I act more Italian than anything...but I have had an extreme amount of conflict in my life.  Very early on, my daddy taught me a wonderful lesson...when in conflict, your words are much more effective in a quiet, calm voice.  If there are two people yelling, no one will hear anyone.  Besides (and the real reason I love this), people become very unnerved when they lose their emotional "cool" and you are seeming like nothing is affecting you.  Inside, be burning up or torn down, but do not let the other person see your cards...   SO, I went into this conversation knowing I needed to channel lawyer-me not Italian-me.  hold on...the other fun part of all of this...the spastic colon is back...ewww

             I am  Mr Do .   I am sedentary by nature, enjoying passive entertainment, eating when the mood takes me, and playing with my food. I try to avoid conflict, but when I'm angered, I can be a devil - if you force me to fight, I will crush you. With apples.  What Video Game Character Are You?       Not quite sure what this means...but, okay!

      ahhh...a new week.  Not much happening.  We watched a movie on friday, "The Missing"...wow...now, I would have never gone to blockbuster and picked that out.  however, hubby's friend loaned it to him and I told him I would watch.  It was suspenseful and pretty good...i probably wouldn't watch it again because it isn't my kind of movie, but it was definitely worth seeing!  Saturday...decided to have another go at the red paint...so glad I did!  This last coat really made a difference and I love it!  I also painted the trim and did the touch up this weekend.  All that remains to be painted is the door jam and the inside of the closet...next week is carpet installation!  YIPPEE!!!  It will be so nice to have soft squishy carpet instead of insanely ugly 50s vinyl:)  Got my hair cut...got taxes done...  So, another boring week in Pfizer-land.  Still no word on if I have a job after the end of the month...not much going on...

      I just finished reading through my past blogs...obviously, I have not a whole lot to do today...anyway...it is funny how I have the astounding ability to embarass myself.  The difference is, as of late, I can be the one laughing the loudest.  The sad thing is that I still do not have a great sense of self-esteem...but oddly enough, it is like I have accepted who I am and am at peace with it...don't get me wrong, I still have moments where I try to be someone for other people but I'm trying to get better with that...I need to stop trying to justify my actions and just respond "take it or leave it, it is who I am and if you don't like it, there is the door"...  As for S...well, we are talking again.  It is weird...she has the same sick sense of humor and as a person who has had a past with ed, seems to be with me eye to eye on many levels...I don't think I can call her my bf...i think she just understands me more than anyone else in my life (girl friend wise).  I have gotten over the stealing thing...I forgive her but it makes me understand I need to be smarter than that and take it for what it is.  My other bf is getting married...I am bummed.  I was really hoping to see tickets go done so I could fly out there to be with him but it isn't going to happen.  So, I will see him for a minute or two at his reception here and go from there.  It will be interesting to see what his wife is like...supposedly, when S was talking to him, his fiance kepts making statements and finally t told her he would have to call her back...which makes me wonder if that is why he wanted to get off the phone as soon as she got home when we talked...S is dying for the reception...her mr x will probably be there and his wife is now pregnant so she wants me to try to get a picture...lmao!  I continually make changes to myself...and, hopefully, they are for the better.  It is truly amazing to see where I have been.  I think a lot of the growth with my emotional health can be accredited to the met.  I really feel like my hormones have finally leveled out and am able to stay even keel most of the time.  There was a time where I really thought I must be crazy...I couldn't understand what was going on or why I was so depressed...I'm starting to believe most of it was from the hormones going crazy...I feel like a new person and it is good to be here!

      oh boy...can souls haunt you even if they are still trapped in a live body?  And by saying this body is live, I'm making an assumption because I would  assume  that if this body was no longer alive, I would have heard about it...  It is so very strange...hubby and I are really doing well...obviously, we have a few spats here and there but nothing out of the ordinary...it is like we have finally gotten to the place where we can understand and appreciate each other.  It used to be where we would try to point out what we were doing for the other, now we both can see it, openly recognize it, and bestow gratitude for the actions the other is doing.  I finally feel like my best friend is back...  enter weird dreams...I have been dreaming about Mr X...not ocassionally (is that spelled right?!) but almost every night.  It is really kind of disturbing.  Sometimes it is me running away from him and sometimes it is him running away from me.  Either way, in the middle of a dream we sit down together and talk about how much we still love each other but that it isn't the right time or that it will never be.  So what the fuck is that supposed to mean?  I mean, I haven't talked, seen, or thought much about this guy for quite some time...and now this?  I don't know, it just seems to prove how messed up in the head I am, unless, which I'm hoping is the case, a living soul can haunt you...

      birthdays...they don't have to suck now, do they?  I guess I have really never enjoyed my birthday...and although I always try to convince myself that I am not expecting anything, I think in the back of my mind I do so I'm disappointed when it doesn't live up to my expectations.  Well, NOT anymore!  I have successfully convinced myself not to expect anything and, guess what?! It works!  So, hubby decides to let me get the diamond band I have been wanting...yippee!!!  We order it off of eBay (SO addicted!) and wait...it comes a week early!  So, I wear it around the house for the night and then tease hubby that he came home to take it away...he tells me I can wear it that I don't have to wait...boy, does he understand!  LOL...  Day of birthday...no biggie...go to work, one of my friends brings me chocolate chip cookies...some others take me out to lunch...go get my license plate renewed (Thanks, Granholm!) and go to a dr's appointment for B...we ship him off to church and then have chinese takeout...exciting???  No!  But very nice...  a lot of people surprised me and remembered it was my birthday...but I wasn't expecting it so I wasn't upset when people didn't remember...just the way it should be!  Now, I am dreading the reception of my friend from Texas...he is getting married on the 13th and they are coming here for a reception on the 21st (BRITNEY SPEARS!!!).  It will basically be a HCA reunion...and I am NOT looking forward!  I feel like I have successfully excommunicated myself from them and feel great about that and now I am being thrown back into the lion's den...ugh...it was rather humorous, he calls me to let me know he is getting married (I already knew, his mom called my mom for our addresses) after a year+ of not talking to each other.  So, he asks me if I will be coming to Dallas for it...I just laughed, assuming he was kidding, which he wasn't so then he was offended and told me that it would mean a lot to him if I could make it.  I told him I didn't think it was possible but that I would see him the following week at the reception here in Michigan.  Well, BF in austin called to ask why he was calling her...she then said, "oh, you must be dreading seeing all of those people in one place"...okay, so why didn't I think of that???  Until she mentioned it, I never gave it a second thought.  It was like I was able to successfully separate the two so I didn't have to deal with the panic...now I am!  I don't want to see these morons!  Anyway...tin tile ceiling is installed and painted...awesome!  I tried painting the room red this weekend and it didn't work so well.  So, now I have to touch up the red and touch up the tile and paint the trim....  more later...

      sad, lonely, depressed, etc, etc, etc...I lost a friend and have realized the old adage "you don't know what you have until it is gone" is painfully true here.  Yes, I realize it was our choice but considering the alternatives we did not really feel that we had a choice.  I guess I should be consoled that he is in heaven happily running around but I'm really not...I miss him.  I miss the way he followed my every footstep...I missed the way he would look at me with those innocent eyes...I miss the unconditional love...I miss the bond he and I had.  curse houses, curse material posessions...who cares about those things when I don't have my friend to share it all with...never again...

      I am haunted...the strange part is, as far as I know, the soul that haunts me is still alive.  Does he realize he haunts me?  Is he aware of his starring role in my dreams?  Does he wake up and wish he was back asleep to spend another fleeting moment together?  I don't understand it and perhaps I never will...is this the evidence I wanted for years?  Did I excommunicate my soul mate?  I always questioned why we were so volatile yet I could never get enough.  Such extreme highs and lows, emotions I have never felt again since my departure.    Lord help me.  I love my husband.  He is the best friend I have...I would do anything for him.  I have tried to cut out this piece of my heart because I know if he had any sense of this he would be crushed...but can I control my dreams?  I sit here and think and rationalize about it all...I have been with my husband longer than I was with him...it has been so long, he surely is not the same person, I know I am not the same...it is a dream, only a dream...but why does it keep playing?  In the waking hours, I have made my choice, I am happy with my choice, I would never change my choice if it was ever an option...it is just the night that needs convincing...

       Sar, your subconscious mind is driven most by Kindness   This means you have a deep desire to be kind and fair to others. You may even be preoccupied with finding kindness in the world around you, far more than you realize on a conscious level.   It is possible that the underlying reason you seek kindness in the world around you, is that you fear cruelty, the opposite of kindness. That could drive you to unconsciously project kindness wherever possible into your world. Regardless of its origin, your steadfast adherence to being kind to others is felt by people you are close to.   You are probably more susceptible than others to being overwhelmed by emotions  both yours and others'. It is possible that your unusually empathic nature is a result of your natural sensitivity to others' pain, and your desire to help them avoid it. For this reason, things might affect you more than they affect your friends and family. To protect yourself from too much emotional intensity, you might want to keep an eye out so you can recognize it when it starts. That will allow you to slow things down until you feel grounded again.   Overall, your strong orientation towards kindness gives you an optimistic nature, which translates into you seeing the best in the people around you. Because you're not one to be overly judgmental, others may seek out your company when they need a friend to talk to. People close to you likely know that you care deeply about the inner lives of others and can listen to what they have to say without imposing your views on them.   Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Kindness, there is much more to who you are at your core.

In short, he has just summed up my lamentations for the past few years in one simplistic yet beautiful sentence...

      Can you tell I don't want to get back to work???  I took this from someone else's blog...I apologize, I shut down the internet before catching your blog title...  This week a "getting to know you" theme with an insane twist.  First, as a warm up, using the letters I-N-S-A-N-E reveal six things about yourself.  Introspective, Neat freak (not really, organization freak), Sarcastic, Affectionate, uNconventional (yeah, I cheated), Ever evolving.  1. What's the best pickup line you ever heard and did it work? this is so retarded...and it wasn't really a pickup line as much as my naivete...a guy just started talking to me and told me he had a fiance.  Well, he was super cool and we were a lot alike...I fell for it and when he told me he didn't have a fiance...well, you know... 2. If you were a character in The Wizard of Oz, who or what would you be? Glenda, the good witch 3. If you were an element of weather, what would you be? rain 4. If you were a breed of dog, what would you be and why. a lab, give me a little bit of love and I'm yours 5. If you were a toy or a game, what would you be and why? Rubiks cube...you can't really ever quite figure me out  Well, kids, I hope this has been educational...and, my boss is circling my cubicle so I guess I will get back to work!

      I'm so frustrated...how can you judge someone when you have NO idea what they are trying to explain???  One of my "friends" came over this morning and started talking about her husband.  She recently told him she was going to file for a divorce so he has been trying to manipulate her and, basically, acting like a child.  Anyway, the discussion somehow led into my dr's appointment.  She asked if it went well.  I told her it was fine, my meds were changed, he added the fish oil...blah, blah, blah.  I guess I had never told her specifically I have been diagnosed PCOS.  I guess it just isn't something I throw out to people.  I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me, I don't really want to have to talk about it.  I don't want to get mad when you, my best friend, are supposed to feign concern for me and forget I might have issues...it just saves me a lot of headache and heartache to just not go into detail.  Anyway...she wanted an explanation of what it is...which led into, how were you diagnosed?  Well, how was I going to explain this???  So, I started at the beginning, when I first was diagnosed with hypothyroidism...well, how did you know something was wrong?  How do you know you were eating right and you should have been losing weight?  At some point, it just got easier to say, "Look, I was anorexic, weight is a huge thing.  I was busting my ass to lose and I wasn't so I knew something was up and I was concerned I would start practicing again."  Lordy...   note to self: a)don't tell people you aren't convinced give a shit what you are actually saying and aren't just waiting for the opportunity to judge b) probably not a good idea to get into this type of conversation at work.   So, I guess by telling her I'm anorexic that meant I was really dying to know what she thought about eating disorders.  Ummm...have you ever even KNOWN someone with one?  Judgement, judgement, and, yes, more judgement.  After she was done with that rant, she went into "You really should try NOT taking the meds to see what will happen."  Oh, yes, that is a brilliant idea!  I have been on these fucking meds for 9months and my hormones are still not under control...lets dump the meds and send them raging again to realize I really MUST take these meds...that makes complete sense to me!  How 'bout this?  You go fucking read some literature on a) thyroid disorders and b) PCOS and then come back and we can have an intelligent conversation.  At some point, she told me I had no business being on met because it is a drug for diabetics and I'm not diabetic.  (Mind you, I was the one who told her it is for diabetics).  To which, I graciously replied, you really should read some lit on PCOS and then you would understand the reasons MET is working for us.  Okay...I know, I'm being oversensitive but I am just so frustrated!  Does she think I don't know that she and everyone else judges me on my weight?  I know, I need to lose weight...I know, in a perfect world it would fly off.  But I have tried over and over...come up with new ways to attack.  Besides the depression I sink into when the new method sucks as much as the others and no weight is lost, I have to be careful.  I am obsessed with the way I look, obsessed with the weight.  Everytime I find out the number I am fighting those demons.  I don't want to go back to where I was in high school but I often contemplate it.  I don't even want to admit this because I am riding the fence right now.  Surely, it can't be bad to cut out all meals but one? blah, blah, blah...yeah, they are right over my shoulder tormenting me.  Then, we have the ever present question of "so when are you having another?" "why are you waiting so long?" "do you just want one?"  JESUS CHRIST!  I really thought I was doing well but last night I dropped B off at his church program and saw one of our "friends".  They had their first when B was two and now they were toting around another...it's tough...I'm not going to lie, I want that to be me.  I think I am just getting apprehensive about M's shower...plus, I don't know if I have mentioned it, my sister is pregnant.  I am thrilled for her, I was worried that she too may be cursed with this so I am so grateful she is not (at this point).  At the same time, there is a small little piece that wants it to be me...  I guess it is just the ignorance...especially the blissfully ignorant.  They don't give a shit what is really going on, they just want to scream at the top of their lungs and have people listen to them.  Guess what, genius?  Not everything that comes out of your mouth is true...and who are you to judge?  I guess I was just taught that you do not judge anyone else until you can be found blameless.    Oh, if everyone was as diversified as me...ha!

      okay...so, are all blogger users being asked if they want to try the new "Gmail" thing?  I didn't get a chance to read it...did anyone else?  Any thoughts?  Not a whole lot to post...as expected, I am sick and very tired...I don't know...has anyone else taken fish oil?  I don't really have an explanation of why I should be sick...the met didn't change and I don't think my thyroid meds do that to me...the change in thyroid meds would be what is making me tired and hopefully that will be done with before the inlaws come this weekend...  AI...well, I still love Fantasia, I still love George.  Simon changes his mind every week on who he thinks will take the competition...do you think he does that to swing votes???  Don't get me wrong Jennifer and the other girl do have pretty voices, I just think George and Fantasia have the personalities to go along with the voice...how cute was her daughter???  Other than that, I passed out on the couch after AI so I didn't get to catch up on "Real World"...I have been hearing rumors that Frankie leaves.  I have mixed emotions about Frankie...such as, is she for real?  I have known cutters before and it really isn't something they let "accidentally" slip out...plus, I know the editing must have been supreme but cutters usually aren't healed in a 10minute consultation with a complete stranger whose best advice is, distract yourself to stop the behavior...wow!  If only my first therapist had told me that when I was in high school...think of the money and time that would have been saved!  So, I guess what I'm saying is, I feel like we are seeing these snippets into who Frankie really is...if she really has these issues, which must be big, I feel sorry for her...I'm sure people are going to be judging her and that type of scrutiny is not what she needs if she is trying to make progression.  Other than that...still trying to figure out the menu for this weekend...

      okay, so I have a confession...I used to live in a glass bubble.  Seriously...I didn't know what a swearword was until 4th grade...I barely knew NKOTB...I didn't drink until I was 20...AND I never watched a complete Molly Ringwald movie until last night!  It is hard to explain to people how conservative my parents were because they end up sounding like Nazis.  I hated it at the time but I look back at what my friends started doing in middle school and high school and am glad to have been saved.  Not that I think I would have given in to peer pressure, I was always the person marching to her own beat but I would have become aware of my individuality a lot sooner...  So "Pretty in Pink" was the movie I watched last night...it was good!  Sometimes when you watch old movies they drive you nuts because they are the old school bad effects, etc. but this was not like that.  I think my favorite part was when Duckie was lip synching...halarious!    I must say, I so identified with Andie in high school...I was the girl hanging out with all the preps spending all their money on clothes.  I just wasn't that way.  It wasn't that my parents didn't have money but I was raised to be frugal so for me, a complete outfit for $15 was much more of a high than getting designer jeans for $90.  I probably committed many fashion faux pas while bargain shopping but it didn't matter to me...I was different and I was made well aware of that by everyone.    At church I didn't fit in because that is where all my preppy friends went so I wasn't in designer duds like they were, I didn't party and get trashed like they did, I chose my friends over my boyfriend, and the list could go on and on.  At school I didn't fit in because I was seen as the "elite" crowd.  My mom was a teacher, my dad was president of the school board, I was the top of my class, and involved in any extra-curricular activity available.  It was kind of humorous because at church I was a prude and weird because of the way I dressed...at school I was the trend setter.  Talk about schizophrenia!  Then there was the situation with the boys.  I felt bad for Duckie last night...and it made me realize what my guy friends must have felt like in high school.  It wasn't until a few years after high school that I realized the guys that I considered my best friends had, at some point in high school, wanted to date me.  And I'm sure they felt I was so self-absorbed in my life that I was just being callous...but that really wasn't it.  I didn't have any idea in high school these guys liked me like that!  I had gotten so used to being the eccentric girl that everyone is friends with but no one remembers to include, I just figured these guys were the same...they provided much less drama than the girls...they were like brothers to me.  I found a lot of solace in these guys and I would have done anything for them.    So the lesson, kids, is this...if you like someone or think you are in love with them...tell them.  Maybe she isn't being cold, maybe she isn't just using you...maybe, just maybe, she doesn't like herself so she would never dream someone else could either...  To be honest, as I'm sitting here thinking and remembering back, I don't know what I would have done...I don't know what would have happened if one of them asked me out on an actual date...and maybe they did and maybe I missed it...maybe I just thought we were hanging out like we always did...I had a boyfriend off and on in high school so I don't know...I just know life is too short to ask the what if's...you have to just grab it by the horns and hold on...   in pink, of course!

         ouch!  My body is killing me...ironically, it feels good.  It is nice when you can get normal responses from the vessel you occupy.  Plus, it reminds me of how much I accomplished this weekend...wow!  I impress myself...haha!  Friday...endo appointment.  Not as bad or as good as I would have expected.  I am basically where I was weight wise last fall...bummer, but at the same time I know how much I was gorging on when I was depressed this winter.  Plus, it is down from my gp appointment so I know it is at least budging.  CV told me I need to stick to the PCOS diet thing but start counting calories.  He said fruit is full of them and I need to be aware so I am not counteracting my proactive approach.  He also agreed that perhaps the fish oil is a good idea...though it counts toward my calories!  He said it will hopefully help kick my metabolism into gear, help with the IR, acne, etc and help me start losing weight.  On the other hand, my thyroid is uncontrollable...he said he is not sure why the increased dose did not work but he is increasing it again and re-checking in six weeks.  If it is still not at the correct level he will have to change it again...ugh...it sucks when it is the thyroid, that's the one that makes me want to sleep all day when he changes it.  On the plus side, he does not want to increase the met.  He is hoping the change in thyroid and the fish oil will help and my met can stay the same.  So now I am up to 6 pills a day...7 if I would start taking a multi-vitamin.  Lordy...I hate the responsibility!  On Friday night, hubby and I watched "Radio" with Cuba...good movie!  Not what I was expecting (I just knew it was a movie about football) but definitely a good watch...  Saturday we went up to B & J's house...we haven't seen them in a year so it was great to finally see them and catch up.  Both hubby and I love J...we were apprehensive as B never seems to pick out someone that is not self-absorbed but we could both tell that she loves him so much and they seem to take care of each other.  They are getting married on June 5th...I am so happy for him, he seems so happy, so content.  I pray this is the one and they live a long life together...  When we got home, we saw the mess Spike made.  Hubby is so ready to get rid of him...he tore a hole in our brand new carpet...I am sick everytime I see it, it hasn't even been a month since we had it installed!  He was trying to get into our bedroom and gauged the door and tore a huge hole in the carpet.  He got down to the furring strips and cut himself so in addition to the huge hole, we had blood spots randomly on the carpet.  Thankfully, he is fine (it must have been a small cut) and the spots came right up...but our poor carpet.  I called the carpet place and they put our name on a board for one of their installers to come do it on the side.  I'm sure it won't happen before our families came over...damn...  Sunday...woohoo!  The weather was awesome!  B woke up at 7am telling us how much he likes to hear the chirp chirp...I'm not sure that he realized it was the birds so I explained that to him and then he was going on and on about how beautiful it was...too funny!  So, hubby was supremely irritated that B was awake so early...I got him into a sweatshirt and we went out to start working.  I cleaned out the garden and weeded...it took about 1 1/2 hours and then we went in for breakfast.  Then, I decided to clean our throw rug and brought that outside to scrub...which led to the scrubbing of the other one...then I took comet to all the dirt on the walls and scrubbed down everything...then I went to the basement and worked some more on cleaning/organizing that...when hubby left for work, I took a rest (read nap!) while B watch "Lady and the Tramp".  When that was done, we went back outside and I did some transplanting...then, I worked some more in the basement.  After B went to bed, I cleared out the dining room and living room so I could do a complete vacuum and waxing of the floors.  I didn't want to wait until this weekend because they get so slick and I really don't want anyone wiping out when they come over...it is spring!  I have my mother to thank for this disease...but I feel so much better when everything is in its place and clean...I told hubby I was coming to a fast realization why my mom had four daughters...she could direct while we cleaned!  I need to train hubby and B how to do this stuff...  It's Monday...I don't want to work...

                 You Are a Peppermint Cappuccino  You're fun, outgoing, and you love to try anything new.  However, you tend to have strong opinions on what you like.  You are a total girly girly at heart - and prefer your coffee with good conversation.  You're the type that seems complex to outsiders, but in reality, you are easy to please      urlLink  What Kind Of Coffee Are You? Take This Quiz :-)          oh, oh!  I'm so excited...Lis got online!  You should go to purplepanda to read what this chicky has been up to...I admit, I'm envious!  It sounds like she is having a fab time in CA!

          Hey...I think I figured it out!  Well, not really...but I read a discussion on unkymoods.com about it and was able to follow the directions...yippee!!!  So, yeah...one blaring realization...I'm old...now, mind you, I should have known going into a teeny-bopper concert.  However, I really don't view myself as old, just a young spirit trapped in an old body.  So, we get to the concert and I immediately have to go to the bathroom.  Well, there is a poor soul whose job is to direct all the crazy women trying to use the bathroom.  "You go here, I need four more ladies to come over here..." Basically, directing traffic.  So, I'm next and she says, "Mom, you just go right over here..."  CRAP!  I mean, yeah, I'm a mom but not of someone old enough to come to this concert!!!  She was probably assuming that someone of my age would not be coming unless they were with child.  So, there were two opening acts...bummer, the first guy was really good but I couldn't understand what he was saying his name was...he had kind of a caribbean feel but was alternative.  Well, we missed the second opening, Skye Sweetnam...can't say I know who she is or cared, I was too busy hitting the souvenir stands with the girls...that was a trip.  Of course, being the uber-dork, I bought a pink newsboy...will I ever wear it???  Doubtful.  I don't foresee a situation where that would be perfectly appropriate.  Well, R's daughter wanted same hat but in black.  The first stand sold out by the time we got to the front...so we go to another.  Last one is on display and I tell the guy that is what we want.  He informs me he is not allowed to sell the display.  So, I'm trying to convince him it is okay because they sold the display at the last stand...while we are having this discussion, another worker reaches behind him to take it and sold it!  At that point, I was pissed!  He couldn't tell me if they would get more and wanted me to go to yet another stand and wait in line for 20 MORE minutes.  I know it sounds stupid...but I felt bad, it is A's birthday and the poor girl just wanted a hat!  (No need to worry, the first stand got some more and she got it...whew!  LOL)  Anyway...the concert starts...please, do not buy tickets to the balcony or upper tiers...mind you, we were at the front of the first balcony but we did not get the full effect of people dancing and going nuts.  I had to sit there like a sane person...bummer.  It was a good concert.  Would I go see her again?  Probably not unless I got the tickets for free or I had awesome seats.  I just didn't get to see the dancing like I wanted to because we were too high up.    It surprised me that the pop princess was so sexual.  Mind you, I was raised in an extremely conservative home but I have been hearing that many parents get up and take home their young children so as not to taint their impressionable minds.  I'm talking whips, dry humping, threesomes, guys on guys, girls on girls...a little over the top.  At the same time, did these parents not see ANY coverage on the tour???  I had heard about this right after it opened...granted, you may have already bought your tickets but you can't tell me you couldn't have sold them!  However, all this sexuality was only overpowering for 2-3 songs...it was kind of cool because she had a costume like the one in the toxic video where she is only wearing jewels...if I had a kicking body like that, I would be tempted to dance around in one of those too!  She explained her voice was out of whack because she has been ill but really only the song "Everytime" suffered...of course, that is my favorite other than "Slave to you" but it was cool...I didn't realize she could play piano either...  I called L while I was there...I know she answered but I couldn't hear anything she was saying...I tried calling her again after we were out but she was probably out partying by then.  I hope she heard some of the concert, I wish she would have been there too.  All in all, a pretty cool time...it was fun to get back in touch with the teen inside...I'm just paying like an old lady today!

      okay...do any of you literate computer language guys know what is going on???  When I see my blog, it replaced all moods with today's mood...why???  If I go into manage my posts it shows the same thing BUT if I pull up the individual posts to edit it will pull up the right mood.  Then when I republish the blog it will put the mood in all posts from whatever post I was just re-editing...ugh!!!  This is driving me crazy!!!

        				 Oh, oh, oh!  I'm so excited...Britney rocks tonight!!!  haha!  I wasn't getting excited until I heard one of her songs on the way into work...yippee!!!  Me, two girls from work, and their teeny-bopper daughters are going...of course, the moms are NOT excited...me, well, I'm ecstatic!    Last night...not much...hubby and I decided...he called his mom and told her they were invited to come down for his birthday.  He also mentioned that he was tired of trying to figure out what everyone else wanted to do for his birthday so she could figure it out with his brother and to call us when they knew what time we should be ready for them to come.  Poor hubby...we won't be going to a baseball game, he just wants to hang out at home so that is what we will do

        	lordy...when does it end?  weekend...pretty non-eventful...I don't even remember what happened Friday, I think I passed out on the couch.  Saturday...hubby has been wanting another tattoo...so, we woke up and I told him to go forth and get ye tattoo...not as a birthday present, per say, but for his birthday he could get the tattoo...so, he has his superman emblem.  It looks pretty cool.  He "said" he wanted to get my initials and b's initials somewhere but he didn't know where to do it.  He had thought about it as an addition to the tribal band on his arm but he didn't know if that would look right.  I told him I would much prefer it on his penis..."if found please return to slh.." haha.  I told him it would keep him honest...somehow, he didn't find the humor in that!  So, we are still trying to figure out what we are going to DO for his actual birthday.  His family drives me CRAZY...now, his brother and his wife won't come to spend the night because they think it will hurt his parents' feelings.  They "offer" to come down for lunch and then they will go back to TC...gee, thanks, you'll spend a whole hour with us???  So, now, hubby feels like he has to invite his parents, brother, sister in law, and my family to the house for dinner, cake, and ice cream.  Actually, a late lunch...but whatever.  So, I had thought I would take him to a Tigers game on Sunday...well, he doesn't want to do that either.  I'm not trying to be all emotional or bitchy but JESUS CHRIST!  Can't I come up with SOMETHING to do for your birthday that you will actually want to do?  I was going to have B go to my parent's house to spend the night on Saturday, have us get up for breakfast and go to the game but he doesn't want B to be gone from us...ummm, he ALWAYS wants a break...okay...he suggests B go to my parents on Friday night instead...no good, I'm going to be cleaning and cooking for your goddamn family all night, I'm not going to be able to go out that night.  It is just extremely frustrating...and he doesn't get why my feelings would be hurt that the last 50+ ideas I have come up with have been shot down and massacred...  I know...it isn't about me, it is about him...but how can it be about him when he won't let me do anything?  I tried explaining it to him but he didn't get it...so supposedly he is calling me at work today so we can try to figure this clusterfuck out...

      I forgot to discuss something very important...haha...The Apprentice.  Please, oh please, tell me this is a set up for Kwame.  Please tell me that Omarosa is not that delusional, hypocritical, liar that she appeared to be last night!  Please believe me, this girl has bugged the bejeebees out of me since first watching...HOWEVER, is she for real?  I mean, she has to know that the cameras are there and even if she is trying to lie in the moment she would be busted in the long run.  I'm trying to give her the benefit of the doubt until next week...because all I see right now is if Erika decides to sue over the "n" thing, she just won...

        	 How could I not be???  There I was, watching Survivor...watching Amber and Rob make promises they couldn't keep...when low and behold my mother in law called!  Now, hubby and I almost always screen calls so the answering machine picks up and someone starts leaving a message and we decide if we want to talk or not (you know, the reason NORMAL people have caller ID...I'm too cheap!)  So, for about 5seconds I seriously contemplated just letting her leave a message...but I wanted to hear what she had to say and get all of this shit over with if that was her intention...  So, I answered, said hello, nothing else...not rude but not warm and inviting like usual either.  She asked if B was in bed because she needed to talk to me and didn't want me to be distracted or not able to talk.  B was in bed, I have no idea if he was actually sleeping but he wasn't hollering for me.  She says she just wanted to call and apologize...apologize for hurting my feelings, apologize for running her mouth...I didn't know what to say.  Obviously, I figured she was somewhat calling to make things right but I guess I had bought into hubby's "she'll never say she's sorry" and was completely taken off guard...I told her how much I appreciated her calling to talk to me about it.  I didn't let it just go though...I figured I had a right to let her hear it from me how I felt...so I told her.  I said I was very hurt by the fact she refused to talk to me that night, that dad turned around and told j that I had chewed her ass, and by them not trying to make it right with me I felt like I was not welcome as part of the family.  She apologized again and told me it was never her intention to hurt me...she was taken aback when I called, dad jumped to conclusion (they never discussed what actually happened until THIS week!!!), and I'm one of two of the only "daughters" she will have.  I told her I forgave her...told her again that it meant a lot to me that she called...and that was that...  Told hubby this morning (he got home late and I was passed out on the couch)...in fine optimistic spirit, he says "So, did you ask her why she fucking waited until THURSDAY night to call?"  I just laughed and laughed...he's right but considering I feel like a piece of hell froze over, I'm not going to sweat the small stuff...haha

      okay...I liked this, and I need a break from moving offices...so, I'm copying...   I am not: packing my crap...I'm tired of it...packing an office you have been in for 3 years is NO FUN! I hurt: my thigh...big nasty bruise from walking into an end table...doh! I love: my boys...if it wasn't for them, I am not sure any of this would be worth it... I hate: liars... I fear: cancer... I forget: everything...but let's not dwell on it! I remember: when I was so stressed out in high school and college...what was I doing???  I miss college and the stupid fun Jen and I used to have...we were so dorky and immature but we laughed and that's all that mattered. I imagine: being on permanent vacation...soaking up rays on Lake Michigan in my cute little bungalow. I hope: to live a long healthy life. I crave: chocolate of course! I regret: the times when I wasn't a good friend... I care: too much about what other people think...I try so hard to disregard but I know those suckers sneak in... I always: psychoanalyze myself.  I want: to pay off all debt and just live to live... I feel alone: after B goes to bed and before hubby gets home... I listen: too much...I need to talk more I hide: my emotions and fears I pretend: that I am happy all the time...I know, you would never guess it reading my blog...but seriously, I don't know how to act sad, mad, irritated...I jump right back into happy. I drive: myself (and probably my hubby too!) crazy! I sing: ALL the time...the worst part about being at work is not being able to sing with the tunes... I cry: mostly when I'm pissed... I destroy: myself...not as much anymore, but I'm still prone to mentally abusing myself...at least the physical abuse is done...progress I dance: not enough!  And pretty badly!  LOL I write: a lot...other than music it is my favorite release. I wake: hubby when he sleeps too long!  haha I breathe: these damn chemicals at Pfizer...yuck! I play: music constantly... I venture: whenever I get the courage...I love to go explore new places but I think the paranoia from my mom has been passed down...I'm always looking for the scary guy about to kidnap me... I find: laughter really is the best medicine...I love to laugh! I pray: God will keep my family safe and healthy I miss: playing the piano I kiss: my boys... I succeed: ??? I learn: more about myself everyday...okay, I really don't listen well enough for everyday, but every week.  I used to avoid myself and now I wonder why I didn't listen sooner... I feel: annoyed...I have water in my ear...I can't get it out and I'm scared my ear drum will burst again... I know: that I am strong enough I joke: terribly!  I am the WORST person to tell a joke...a) I can't remember how the story gets to the punchline b)I'm laughing too hard because I know the joke and it makes me giggle...I try not to tell jokes! I say: feed the American children...then you can worry about the ones that don't live in our own country I change: my home decor a lot I fail: at being the perfect person people want me to be. I dream: of being healthy, fit, and content with myself. I believe: I am a better person than I used to be I wonder: about many strange things...and I like to have answers so I usually make myself look foolish because of this weird curiosity of mine... I worry: that my hubby will die and I will be without my best friend...I know, I shouldn't even think about it I wish: for lovely weather again. I fight: only when necessary...I hate conflict I need: much less than I am blessed with  I am: who I am because of where I have been I: choose to be filled with joy! Current music: Evanescence   Feeling MUCH better than yesterday...I just have these moments of dark where I allow all the demons knocking on my door to come into the light...bad idea.   Poor, poor B...he took a nosedive right out of his loft last night...scared the bajeebees right out of me!  It was after midnight and I must have fallen asleep while waiting for hubby to come to bed...all of a sudden, BAM! and then he started to cry a little, I'm pretty sure he was still sleeping until I ran in there and grabbed him.  Thankfully, his blanket came down with him and probably protected him from being beat up by anything in his way...tonight, I will be reorganizing his room to make a clear path if that should happen again...it is so weird because he has had this bed for over a year and has NEVER fallen out...

      My post on my PCOS board...   Mandi~  Well, I can tell you why you wrote...it is exactly what I have been feeling...I was so sick this weekend...surprise, a period started on Thursday...but no period I have ever experienced before...I hate them.  I used to be physically ill when I was a teenager with cramps, so I know what hideous cramps are.  But this...not even my meds could subside them in the least.  And, I would be feeling better, than get worse again.  I basically slept all weekend and am sitting here at work wondering how I'm going to make it through tonight with B...  I look at my weight...and, yes, since having B I have gone down one size.  ONE SIZE...I have been watching what I eat, started excercising and NOTHING is happening.  I'm so disgusted.  I hate looking the way I look, I hate feeling the way I feel and sometimes I wonder if I'm not losing weight because I'm too scared.  I can't get myself to accept this is it and I can't take not seeing anything move.  I started crying to hubby today because I feel like shit...it makes me wonder if I wanted the Met to work so I made myself think I was feeling better.  Right now, I feel so close to what I did last year this time.  My body has started aching and stiffening and it scares me.  The only good thing I have is that my appointment with the endo is next Friday.  I will be able to unload on him and see what he says.  Plus, I haven't had my blood taken yet (doing it tomorrow) so maybe it will show if something is really going on to make my muscles so tight...  anyway...thank you for your post...it really did help...and I'm trying not to lose hope.  Most days, hope is all that keeps me looking to a better tomorrow.  Take care~S   god...I wish I could stop being a downer...I'm really tired of being "depressed".  I know I haven't hit bottom yet, but do I have to???

      ugh...I hate periods.  I go through loving it when I have a semi-normal cycle that comes right on que...to this, hating it.  Why does my body have to be so messed up?!  I think this is what I really hate...my cramps have been on and off all weekend and it really is driving me nuts.  I don't understand it and it worries me...one more thing to take up with the endo in a couple weeks...  So, hubby and I had a knock out fight on Friday (???)...I can't remember but I'm almost positive...yeah, it was Friday.  Anyway, Lis called from LA to talk to me about her new job...I miss her so much!  She sounds like she is having an awesome time...anyway, she had missed my blogs about all the mil drama before she left...so now she won't be able to read them until she comes back home...I tried to sum it up for her and, at some point, something was said which hubby believes Lis called his mommy psycho...I don't remember it...maybe she said it, more likely I said it...but, yes, we are all agreeing, mom=psycho.  He was NOT happy!  He thinks that is like the pot calling the kettle black (he thinks my family has our own issues...which we do!) and he doesn't appreciate me talking to my sis about his mom being crazy...  Then...I burned the steaks because I wasn't paying attention while I was talking on the phone...B REFUSED to eat the mashed sweet potatoes...basically, we all had melt downs...B was sent to bed and had all of his toys taken away (yeah, crazy, I know...)...then hubby and I came down here to start screaming at each other...ugh.  He basically told me that never in our years together has he heard me admit I might be wrong so he should just shut the fuck up and not say anything...I told him to go live a psycho life with his family in TC...and asked him to leave...(I also threatened divorce at some point...mature, don't you think?).  Well, he left...for an hour...but it was a LONG hour...to which I did actually psycho analyze myself...and, I need to go back and ask him if he really thinks that or if he only said it because he was mad.  He came back...we made up...everything's hunky-dorey...I feel really bad.  I think I have come so far with the temper/swearing/name calling/threatening bs and then I just allow myself to go over the edge...I apologized to which he accepted...  Okay....but do I really think I am always right?  Ummm...I don't know.  I am a highly opinionated person, yes, but I don't  think  I am always right...do I?  See, I know I USED to do that but I didn't think I was that way anymore...I actually think that every person is a set of circumstances that make them who they are and influence the choices they make and the way they live their lives...who am I to question/judge someone?  I have not lived in their shoes, nor have they lived in mine...my mommy would be so disappointed.  She is of the opinion that almost, if not all, things are black and white...I think we live in a mostly fuzzy gray world.  The point is, if I do behave like this, I feel really bad...I mentioned to hubby that there aren't a lot people who I really care to know what they think of me...he is the number one person I care about...I don't want him to think that I have this over the top opinion of myself in which I am right and he is wrong all the time...obviously, it happens naturally a lot of the time...haha!  As for the birthday...as hubby said, we are on plan D.  The master plan: VEGAS...shot down because of money needed for cruise...plan A: Big birthday party...gone, hubby doesn't want a huge crowd just for him...plan B: A family party...no good, I told hubby I am willing to invite his family but I think he is thinking it won't work...could be true but I feel bad, it is HIS birthday...plan C: His brother and sil coming down for the weekend...now, this one is not completely out but gets a little tricky...I guess I will call the sil and tell her party is out and dance around the issue if they still want to come down.  Hubby would love to spend time with his bro but don't want his parents upset they weren't invited...makes sense, but I don't really care how they feel right now...SO, if that doesn't work (or maybe I will go in correlation with plan C) is plan D: a baseball game...hubby has been wanting to go see the Tigers play for quite some time and ironically, they do have a game on his birthday...I don't know if it is a "real" game or a pregame, but does it matter that much???  Oh, yeah...mil is a fruitcake...she actually asked hubby if we would come up for Easter when they were on the phone...I TOLD him that she would assume I was just going to  get over  what happened!

      I LOVE being able to call in sick...now, was I truly sick?  It all is a matter of perspective...honestly though, it is that time of month...and since I haven't had a time since early February, I guess this one decided to be a doozy.  I am thankful for it though, I was getting really worried about what my hormones were doing and dreading going to the endo in a couple weeks...I still think he will up my medications because I missed again but I feel a false sense of accomplishment since there was no induction of the visit...anyway, I got up this morning and started getting ready and was overtaken by cramps.  The dog ate my bed buddy a month ago, so I have no source of heat to aid in the cramps...I took some Pamprin but it never kicked in...so, finally, at 8, I called my boss and told him I would not be showing up...oh, rats!  I went back to bed and slept...woke up about 11am to hear hubby on the phone...  one guess who it was...did you guess?  Yes, the beloved mil...I went downstairs to see what B was doing (watching cartoons) and went into the kitchen where hubby was...I wanted to find something hot to drink but we have no cafe latte...only coffee, hot apple cider, or hot chocolate...nothing sounded good...so I sat there while hubby wrapped up the conversation with his mother...ugh...  he gets off the phone and just stares at me...well?  We didn't really have much of a conversation about it because I'm hunched over trying not to fall over from the cramps...anyway, the gist of what is said...she still claims she em>may  or  may not  have made the comment about our financial situation...she has the utmost respect for me because I handled myself so well and was never disrespectful to her...my fil told J I chewed her ass based on her hideous reaction to our conversation (her going postal while we were on the phone and then going to her room and sobbing after she hung up)...I took her off guard because she couldn't figure out who I had heard all of this from and that is why she wouldn't talk to me...she did not intend to send the message that I couldn't call her, she now claims that she feels I was strictly calling because hubby was upset...uh-huh...she also is so distraught because she knows how much I must be hurt by everything that has gone on...meanwhile, she wants hubby to tell her what needs to be done to make it right with me...to which hubby says, you need to talk about it with sar, I can't be in the middle of this, I support her and you need to make it right with her.  I am still trying to figure out how I feel about all of this...on one hand, yippee, they realize that they hurt me and I feel like it has been a huge milestone to get them to see I am a real person with real feelings that can be and are hurt by them...on the other...are we in jr high?  How can you not know how to make something right if you hurt another person?  To which hubby says they are really bad communicators...I'm pretty sure even the worst communicator knows how to say "I'm sorry"...even B, who is four, knows when he needs to give someone an apology.  I just find it really hard to believe that she is up there so concerned that I am down her having been hurt and she can't come up with a solution to try to make it better.  Meanwhile, hubby's 30th is only three weeks away...he wants his family and my family invited over to celebrate.  I asked him today how he felt about just his brother and sil being invited.  I don't mean to be a bitch...but how can I have these people in my house and celebrate with them when they can't extend any type of an apology...even if they don't apologize, could they at least try to talk to me about what happened?  I told hubby I thought it was strange in a way that she had not thought about the long term ramifications of what has happened.  I.E...I have her only grandson (for at least a few months), and does she expect me to invite them down, go there for visits, and allow B to go there without us when none of this has been resolved.  To which I followed up, but how is this any different than the past five years...I have put up with this woman's shit since hubby and I got married and that hasn't changed my behavior, it has resolved me to work harder to be accepted...damn...maybe I am nuts...  Anyway...I read the book "Holes" today...it is a children's book my sis loaned me along with "Bridget Jones' Diary"...it was so good...I really like books that have twists or correlations in them...it was an easy read, it took 2 1/2 hours to read...lol...it makes me want to rent the movie that has been made but I always hate it when I end up watching the movie and not liking it...if they ruin the story it makes me mad...haha...

      I forgot to cover American Idol!  My lord were the judges rude!  I know it is their job to critique, and I agreed that most of them had some issues on Tuesday...but why comment about someone's weave!  My LORD!  It was like she sang well but we don't like her so let's find something else to rip on...oh, her hair!  The kid who sings like Frank did horrible, and I have heard that the judges had him in tears after the show...my god!  This kid is what, 16?! Leave him alone!!!  I agree, his voice is geared for one genre...but he does a mean impersonation...he is so dorky, he is cute...the thing is...even if these people have "bad nights" they are tons better than the majority of people who get up to do karaoke...  I didn't vote...haha!  Still only the one time...my favorites are still George and Fantasia...those two rock!  They had best make it into the top three...I'm not sure who else I would choose...the thing is, the rest are all kind of on the same level...they are good but not consistent.  I must say, I was glad Amy went home.  Don't get me wrong, she has a good voice...but those times where she just went all airy/breathy and couldn't really hit the notes just happened too often for me.  You can't hit those, stop trying and stop picking songs that make you do that...

      Lordy...I hate having to do actual work when I am at work...I'm not really sure WHAT I did, but yesterday, I never stopped...ugh.  I had some shitty training that I have had to attend four different versions of already.  I sit in the room and see people who I KNOW have already been told this crap and they have questions that have ALREADY been answered previously...people are morons!  To add to my joy of cubicle living, I have been informed I am being moved into building 306...that's right, the den of evil.  It is going to be miserable...no more anonymity, plus, I am sitting right by one of the entrances AND the only bathrooms in the building...ew!  My boss couldn't care less...he is on the opposite side of the building from management and is happy...meanwhile, I am in the center of traffic and will be visible to all...bastard...  On a halarious note, hubby called last night from work...he told me he had "ordered" us a present.  I was highly suspicious because if my hubby sees something he wants, it is usually in the back of a magazine or catalog but he was telling me that the surprise is free.  I asked him if he would give me a "hint" to which he just told me what he ordered...a better sex video and booklet and some other surprises are in it!  LMAO...I was laughing so hard!  See, I'm considered the "freaky" one and he is always so resistant to new things...he liked his kama sutra book I got him for Christmas a couple years ago, but he only reads up on a new position every three-four months...so at this rate, we won't be through it before the next life.  I guess this radio station he listens to had a "sex expert" on and they were giving away these better sex kits.  My hubby decided it sounded cool and called in to order us one...haha!

      okay...I'll admit it...I'm officially an emotional wreck at the moment...Lord, I really do love these hormonal rollercoasters I get to ride on!  This one I jumped on at the moment is called "Time of the month Hell"  Of course, if you don't choose to ride this ride as often as you should, say once a month, it tends to be that much worse when you do get on...yesterday, I was a WRECK!  I was tearing up and occassionally breaking down in tears at random moments...beautiful!  So, before my hormones went to hell yesterday, I called my sister and brother in law...aka the whackjobs in TC that just gave birth to my first niece.  I called because I wanted to see how the new mom was doing, how baby was doing, and how they were all adjusting after coming home from the hospital.  Bad move...she called me back here at work and went on and on about how she gave birth naturally and how my bil has such HUGE respect for women who choose to do it completely naturally.  Hey, dumbass, just because I had drugs doesn't make it any less of a challenge to push a baby out of that teeny-tiny hole.  Ahhh, I hope she achieved whatever it was she attempting to do...make herself feel good?  I don't know.  I have never regretted my decision to get drugs...I guess it is just annoying that she should think her birthing experience was more miraculous than anyone who had drugs.  Guess what, brainiac?  It's God's miracle in the first place...he just chose to use you as a tool...needless to say, I won't be calling them for quite some time...  Luckily, hubby completely understood.  See, I called from work and had to leave a message.  I didn't leave my work number, I just figured I would talk to them later in the afternoon.  So, they called our house to get my work number from hubby.  Hubby and his brother talked for a while about how they were doing...hubby had told his brother that I had been anxious to hear how everyone was doing and that I must have finally broke down and done it myself since he hadn't.  Brother asks him if we had thought about having more children...they were so excited we had dropped everything to come see them and to watch us with the baby, they were impressed and wondered why we hadn't had more yet.  So, hubby says, I could have sworn we have had this conversation...and goes into the whole, she has been told it won't happen naturally...bs.  Wow...I don't even really know what I think.  I think I don't want to think about it...anyway, brother kept going on and on about how he was so thrilled we came up right away and hubby had called ME before they called back to let me know the conversation and "forewarn" me she would probably go on and on about how much our visit meant...ummm, nope!  Nothing like that was even alluded to...so hubby is thoroughly disgusted, especially considering what he and his brother had talked about.  Like I told him, I am a sensitive enough person NOT to say such bs to someone but the downside is that I am sensitive to then get my feelings hurt when someone says that crap to me...I need to learn to let this stuff run off my back and not effect me...  On a much, much happier note...I was able to stay awake and watch AI.  GO FANTASIA!  LOL!  I never got through the night before so I was a little stressed she might not win.  Oh yeah, did you see the point JASMINE went to sing and Jennifer Love Hewitt called her Jennifer???  DUH!  Read the cue cards girl!  Anyway, I was so happy for Fantasia...and, of course, it made me cry!

      wow...I just feel so, strange...I don't know, it is weird.  I'm like in between melancholy and happy I guess.  I am not depressed but I'm not my usual self either.  I don't really know how to describe it...I feel so much more introverted than I usually am...more self-reflective...  So, sister in law had the baby...we got a call on Friday night to say she had been having contractions.  Well, every first time mom thinks they are about to have a baby so both hubby and I kind of poo-poo'd it.  Well, low and behold, Saturday morning I got a call at 7:30am to say they were in the hospital.  Hubby and I had a long talk/fight about what to do.  I was so opposed to going up there...not because I didn't want to see the baby, because I did.  Finally, I was able to verbalize, I didn't want "us" to be in turmoil again like what happened after the shower.  I didn't want to put myself in such a vulnerable place to be hurt and then have him take their side.  I was scared.  But after being able to say all of that to him, I saw in his eyes how important it was to him to go.  We were supposed to have our friends from IN come...well, hubby said to have them come and he would go by himself.  I called T and explained...told her I just felt I needed to be there with him, she completely agreed and wished me luck.  I know she doesn't understand me 99% of the time, but I love her...she is such a good person and is such a great friend to me.    Anyway, I cried to my mom about how scared I was.  Please understand, I am not upset they were having a baby...it just brings to the forefront something I try so hard to ignore so I can go about my life...it may never happen again for us.  Add to that vulnerability and hurt the fact that his family always makes cruel comments regarding this...I just was dreading the inevitable abuse I was about to put myself in front of.  Mom said she had no idea what I was feeling like...but encouraged me to realize I was doing the right thing and I was being the bigger person...then my preggo sister called.  Talked to her for a while...kinda get the picture I was trying my best to delay??? I was!  So, we finally get ready and leave at 11:45am...car trips with toddlers!  Literally, ten minutes after we leave..."I gotta go potty."  YOU JUST WENT!  Lordy...what is normally a 2 1/2 hour trip took almost 5 HOURS!!!  Three stops for the bathroom, one for gas (and the bathroom) and one for lunch.  We finally got there at 4:30pm...man!  And, of course, it was freezing and we had dressed for the hot and humid weather we had.  I actually had commented to hubby that we should pack coats...but we both kinda laughed it off and said there was no way it was going to be cold there...wrong-o!  I can't believe how good the baby is...she barely cried while we were there.  We stayed for about an hour and a half.  Hubby immediately wanted to hold her, which he usually is very apprehensive about babies.  At first, I didn't know if I could...but hubby kind of shoved her in my arms.  He always knows exactly what I need...it immediately took my mind off the bigger picture and I got to hold my new niece, Leslie Maxine...I'm not going to say she was cute, I'm not a fan of newborns...wait a few months and I'm sure I will find her adorable but babies are just not my thing...anyway!  Yes, I got all kinds of, "when are you going to have another?  don't you think B wants a sibling?"  "B, you should tell mommy you want a baby too"  all the inappropriate bullshit people impose...and, yeah, it hurts...alot.  But, we left to go meet hubby's parents for dinner and stopped at Old Navy and I was able to nurse my wounds with retail therapy.  Yesterday, I slept basically all day.  Hubby woke me up for some breakfast and I took a bath...then he woke me back up at 2pm when he left for work.  I can't explain why I was so tired...but I was.  Hubby says I just seemed so sad...I guess I kind of am.  I want to have another baby but neither of us want to take the next step of intervention.  Part of me thinks, do it, try it, get what you want.  The other part of me says, if it is meant to be it will happen.  That part always wins out...but what happens if I regret that decision when I get older?  And part of me wonders, why isn't it meant to happen?  Do I suck so bad at being a parent God doesn't want to entrust me with another?  To top it off...my breasts are hurting...damn.  Of course, my heart says, oh, I'm pregnant!  But my head says, you are about to have a period.  So, I look at my calendar and it has been two months since the last one.  Ugh...I'm really off track again.  I swear I don't want to spend another cent on a hpt...those damn things have gotten enough money from me!  But on the other hand, do I sit here and constantly question until a week or so when it shows up?  Better to put myself out of my misery I think...  So, no, I'm not depressed...I don't know what I am...self-reflective...

      ok...so I better write about this dream before I forget everything.  Mr X was there...he had been searching for me for a long time and finally found me.  He told me he wanted to talk to me "alone".  So, we went to this place, I assume it was his house.  He started asking me many random questions about my life and what I had done, etc.  I told him I was happy now and that I never knew I could be happy without him but that I was.  He kept pounding me about, well, when we were together, was this real, was that real...etc.  He wanted me to assure him that I had truly loved him.  I told him, of course, I was in love with you, I never would have gone through all the bs if I hadn't but it isn't the same anymore...and it never will be the same.  I told him I was such a different person without him and that I was with someone who inspired me to continue growing.  Enter hubby...hubby came to find me because he had heard I was with Mr X.  Hubby was crushed that I was with him and assumed that I was there because I wanted to leave him and go to Mr X.  I tried explaining to hubby that I was simply trying to explain to Mr X how much happier I am and how he and I were never going to be together again.  Well, in the background Mr X is getting more and more upset.  Finally, I convince hubby to leave and let me finish the conversation with Mr X and that I would be coming to him shortly.  Well, Mr X told me, no, I'm not going to let you leave me again.  And then I was dead.  I didn't see myself die so I have no idea what happened...weird, huh?  The rest of my dream was me, dead, telling hubby how much I love him and how much I appreciate everything he has ever done for me...  Now, that I relay it, it is kind of a sad dream I guess.  But when I first woke up, I was so relieved by it.  Finally...I realize in my subconscious that I have made the right choices for me and I'm exactly where I need to be.  I have been so haunted by Mr X for years...and here, after nine years together, I finally get it right...too long in coming.  I am not going to read too much into the rest of it...just take the peace that Mr X should not be haunting me anymore.

      Our weekend was good.  We got to go see Lis in Chicago.  It wasn't warm but it wasn't raining either.  We were at the McCormick Center which is right on the water, it is just south of the aquarium and museums at Soldier Field, so it was pretty windy.  It was so much fun!  They have these huge tents set up where you get to drive all of their cars.  Hubby's favorite was the little two seater Crossfire and realistically, I really liked the Pacifica.  I did get to drive the Volkswagon Bug.  Uh-oh, not good...hubby could barely fit in the backseat!  The guy who rode with us pushed his seat all the way forward and Scott still was scrunched back there...lol!  Plus, it was a convertible so I doubt he could have made it with the top up!  I guess I will be waiting a LONG time for my bug...haha!  Anyway, they had all these courses set up for you to drive and see the different features of their cars...of course, B and I both loved the part where we got to hit the gas and slam on the breaks at the last second...lol!  We were there for about four hours, driving the different cars, watching a cigar rolling demonstration, just hanging out with Lis and her friends.  Then we drove out to Oak Brook for our favorite pizza...yummy!   Sunday we just picked up the house, did a little yard work, and hung out.  My friend and her son came over and we took the kids to the carnival that was in the parking lot of Wings.  We were there for several hours as the kids rode most of the rides.  B has about 6 inches to go before he can ride the adult rides...boy was he upset!  He wanted to ride the Ferris Wheel so badly and all the other "adult" rides.  It was so funny!  They had one of those huge slides where you walk up this incredibly high staircase and slide down on something that looks like a potato sack.  Well, he was tall enough to go alone so I told him he could do it, thinking he would never make it up the stairs.  It took him about three minutes to get up the stairs.  He kept stopping and just standing there and then he would start back up.  I was just laughing because it looked like he was trying to convince himself to go up...after he went down once, he was hooked.  His friend wanted to go after watching B do it but backed out once he was on the top...B just said, "I'm not scared of anything!"  But when he was relaying this all to hubby he tells him, "The stairs made me a little worried but then I remembered I'm not scared..."  too funny!  The two kids did not get along and I was getting pretty disgusted.  My friend was NOT policing her child.  I understand B was misbehaving as well, but I was all over him when he was naughty.  She was just letting it continue...her kid was calling B names and being really mean.  Finally, I had enough.  I know it isn't appropriate to parent someone else's child but my child was being hurt in the process.  So, I started telling him to cut it out.  The final ride of the evening, this kid hauls off and punches B.  I yell at him to leave his hands to himself.  Not two seconds later, this kid is slapping him.  I yell out, "C! Get your hands off B NOW!"  At that point, my friend says, I think it is time to go home.  YOU THINK???  She had driven us so they had to drop us back at our house.  While we are enroute, C says, can we go and play at their house?  She tells him, we'll see.  Hell no!  So I pipe in, B and I are going to be taking naps when we get home.  I was not about to invite this kid into my house to beat on B some more.  I know, I know, I sound like one of those overprotective moms...but really, this shit had gone on for a really long time and I didn't feel I was protecting B by allowing this kid to act like a maniac and yelling at B when he would start doing the same thing.  Needless to say, it will be a very long time before we get together with them again!  anyway...I finally had a dream with some closure...I will relay it later.  I've been avoiding work for almost two hours now!

      I don't have anything important to say, but I am desperately trying to avoid going to work...  Well, it seems to be working for the moment.  I have been taking a fish oil pill before I go to bed and I seem to be okay.  It is really amazing how much better I feel.  I was so sick for the past few weeks and was really getting down in the dumps about it.  I feel so much better!  I think I will do this for a week or two and then try two pills again.  I've been feeling so good that I decided I need to get on the ball with excercise.  I hate saying this because I always flake out but I really am trying.  I keep envisioning myself on that cruise ship fat and presto! there's some motivation!  I'm trying to build up a tolerance to running.  I know that walking is really good for you but the results come so much slower.  I would much rather just beat my body into compliance and then walk to maintain.  Not asking too much, eh?  I can run an embarassing amount of time before I a)can't breathe and b) my back feels like it is going to break.  Well, I guess I need to go back to the dr for my inhaler...ugh.  Anyway...hubby is in training this week so B is in daycare all day and then we are all home together at night.  Wow...it is so nice.  I feel guilty about B but spending time as a family at night is really cool.  It makes me hopeful for when he is done with school and hopefully can bid for first shift...I didn't realize normalcy felt so good...  Thursday is the award ceremony at work.  I'm so glad I'm feeling better...this gives me a better chance of not crying when hubby receives his award.  I guess this award symbolizes all the sacrifices we have made as a family, as a couple, and on individual levels.  It also allows him to close some doors on the trials he faced last year.  I'm just so proud of him...  See?  I warned you I had nothing important to say!  I fell asleep on the couch watching "America's Next Top Model" update show...damn!  I really wanted to see it!  Maybe they will replay it someday...

      Wow...Blogger has really changed this up...it looks so cool and, hopefully, will be easy to use!  What a good weekend!  Nothing spectacular but nice...Friday, we went to SofS to get a new title and transfer my plates...then I went home and watched Oprah.  We didn't do a whole lot...actually, I'm pretty sure I zonked out on the couch by 7-7:30pm!  Thankfully, I woke up around midnight to wake up hubby and get us up to bed.  Saturday, hubby had training all day so it was just B and I.  I was able to get a lot of the basement cleaned out, yippee!  We also stopped by my parents house for some hostas my mom was breaking up.  Lis was there...thank god they didn't notice her tongue ring while we were there!!!  That would have been pure hell...and, thankfully, they are going to see her on Sunday so we won't be in Chicago at the same time either...I'm dreading the phone call when they do find out!  It didn't look gross at all, but for some reason I was completely freaked out by it...  Sunday...B and hubby gave me my presents...too spoiled!  I got the cd player for my car I've been bugging him about...mind you, I didn't expect it for mother's day!  I just wanted to use the extra cash we had burning up for it...I also got a window box and another big planter...that means flowers!  Hubby was funny...in the morning before I opened them, I showed him the cd player at Circuit City for sale.  He says, I guess we better save our pennies.  HA!  I never saw it coming!!!  Then, when I opened the planters, he says, yes, I am well aware this means you need to buy MORE flowers...lol, he knows me so well.  Oh, yeah...they also gave me this beautiful orchid corsage.  Now, I am not the corsage type, so when we went out to eat, I put it in my hair...B loved it.  He kept asking if boys can wear flowers in their hair because "it's so cool"...so, I promised him I would wear it to work today so everyone could see it too...I love my boys!  Back to the grindstone...I decided to go drug free this weekend.  I just mentally could not take another day of being exhausted and nauseous all day.  Surprisingly (PLEASE NOTE SARCASM), I felt fabulous all weekend.  Hubby was concerned because he knows I will pay for it once I start back up(today!) but I really needed the mental reprieve.  I felt like a new person this weekend...gone were the mood swings, gone was the exhaustion, gone was the nausea...it was like the old me was back...I miss her...

      People annoy me...the older I get, the more introverted I become.  I am really starting to believe it is because I am so easily annoyed with people...  case in point:  I have a friend that is getting a divorce.  She decided she didn't want to be married anymore, she wants to live the single life.  Mind you, she just moved back in 9months ago (she had lived a year of separation with her hubby).  I'm not trying to judge you but what do you mean you want to live the single life?  She has fooled around on her hubby, she had a guy waiting in the wings for her...just say, I want to explore these other options.    Anyway...this new guy tells her he will call, tells her they will do lunch, etc and just doesn't follow through.  9 times out of 10, he's not following through.  Now, she wants to piss and moan that he isn't following through (oh yeah, he has a wife and a baby too--though, I think they are separated, but not divorcing).  Finally, I casually suggested that she should just write him off.  I asked her why was she so drawn to him, they have only gone out half a dozen times.  She asked me what I meant...to which I responded, "My little sis has taught me a lot about dating, should I ever be out there again.  If the guy doesn't treat you right, if he doesn't act like he should, or if the chemistry isn't there, cut him loose.  Don't beat yourself up about it, it is simply two people that are not compatible with each other."  Which should be common sense, but I know for a lot of girls (myself being one of them) it really isn't...our emotions take over and the rational side of our brain goes on vacation.  It's not that easy...is what she responds with.  I agree, if you aren't used to that, it isn't easy but it is the right thing.  So she says "why do you think I'm so drawn to him?"  Okay...lesson, if you ask me my opinion, I will be 150% honest with you....I try very hard to deliver it tactfully but I can't make any promises, therefore, if you don't want complete honesty, DON'T ASK!  To which I responded, I don't know if this is true, but from what I have seen, you seem to like the falling in love part and the new infatuation...but once that part of a relationship is over you seem to check out too.  Yeah, I'm sure you can imagine, she didn't like that so much but she said, You're right.  I never thought of it like that before but it is true.  Dude, I'm really not out to be right...I just don't understand why you must bitch about something you are completely bringing on yourself.  SOOOOO...she goes into how she and one of our friend's ex-husbands are talking and she thinks he likes her...this is the SAME friend who dumped her best friend because she started dating her ex-husband.  She is actually contemplating what she should do!  She was the one who brings up, I don't want to be like C and steal someone's ex but what should I do?  Is this really a question???  You just answered yourself!  DON'T!  You couldn't handle it so why would you risk a friendship expecting someone else to???  Lordy...stupidity bugs me...  Other than that...CP and I are planning a trip to Chi-town for the end of the month.  Nothing major, just some shopping, some clubbing, and then home again.  We'll stay over one night but I am so excited!  K may come with us, though she gets very intimidated by large cities...so I don't know if she will chicken out or not.  I so need a day away from everything...only a few more weeks!!!

      Isn't life strange?  The past week has been a continuous cycle of stress...and, now, that it is all over, I just want to forget all the stress, find the good, and move on!  We put Spike down.  Please, be kind with the judgements.  He was destroying the house and we just couldn't figure out a way to solve it.  I miss him, he was my puppy and I love him so much.  At the same time, I couldn't argue with hubby about how much stress this was causing and how angry it was making him.  Namely, our brand new carpet is now destroyed.  I guess carpet is much more satisfactory to tear up than hardwood floors?  He has not torn at flooring before.  Okay, correction, he ripped up some vinyl when he was new but nothing since.  So, he suffers from extreme nervousness.  When someone other than hubby, B, and I come into the house he freaks.  He will run and hide under the bed if our room is open and bark his head off.  Seriously.  For three hours one time because I couldn't pull him out.  Or, if I anticipate someone coming and close off the doors, I lead him back downstairs and he crawls into my lap while people try to let him sniff their hands.  Anyway, I am trying to justify what we did, I guess.  We knew that because of his fear he would be so scared and people would have little patience so we decided to put him down than put him through that.  I think it was the right thing to do although a few of my friends have voiced their adament disapproval.  Ironically, anyone that knows Spike agreed with us, he wouldn't have made it if we sent him away.  Regardless, I miss him very much.  It is better this week...part of me has acknowledged he is gone so the constant thoughts are winding down.  My inlaws...I don't even want to go into this.  I have spent the whole weekend arguing with hubby about it all and I'm tired of the control they have when we are trying not to let them have control.  As I told hubby, I am done seeking them out, I am done begging for a relationship.  They can live in TC with each other and live their twisted lives together.  I will continue to follow through with my obligations as their daughter in law but no more than is necessary.  The silver lining?  The shower is over...now, I know I will probably have to go up there once the baby is born but after that...I don't see any reason to interact until we go to the races...potentially two and a half months of freedom!!!  THAT is something to look forward to!  A plus side to this whole nightmare of a past week, I got a new car.  The Barto-mobile has been retired and I miss it.  However, there is nothing like the comfort of knowing when you turn that key, your car will respond appropriately without any screeching or squealing.  We were looking at a new truck for hubby since I cannot drive his stick and that way, when my car did break down, we would be able to share a vehicle until it was fixed.  Well, hubby decides since he is getting a new vehicle it must have all bells and whistles.  BUT it did not bother him that he wanted to buy a '97 Expedition...maybe I'm wrong but wouldn't it be beneficial to buy a younger truck with less miles and less features???  It won't mean a thing that your vehicle has heated seats if the stupid thing won't run!  So, everytime we would go look, we would get mad at each other.  Finally, I told him I was done looking.  We could continue driving the same vehicles until one died and that would be the one we replaced.  Now, don't get me wrong...hubby has been nagging me for two years to get a new car.  My car was paid for and I liked not having a car payment so I held off.  He won.  He suggested I look online for a car instead of a truck.  I found a car in a different state that was extremely low mileage and a great deal.  Plus, he took my car for a trade in.  He is also a cop so, of course, for hubby that sealed the deal.  It has been strange getting used to the new car but I really like it!  Other than that (!), this week looks promising!  B has an appointment with the etn dr today.  I am very hopeful this is finally the right specialist to tell us what is going on and how we can help him...my health is haywire as expected.  I am praying this is the right dose because I'm not exactly sure I can take going through all of this again in six weeks.  Did I mention my oldest sis is pregnant???  YIPPEE!!!  I'm so excited for her...and, now, I am trying to figure out what to do...go to NY before baby is born, after, next year, both???  Decision!  The baby is due at the end of November so maybe I should go at the end of the summer and then the beginning of next year.  Plus, I am wondering if she will be coming home before then so we can throw her a shower!

      man!  Do you ever get nauseous?  I swear, it is terrible!  I don't know what the deal is but it has been happening...it hits mid-afternoon and I just feel exhausted.  I feel so sick to my stomach and eating doesn't help and not eating doesn't help...yuck!  Monday night I put in a frozen pizza (very gourmet!) for B and I...well, he was watching "Brother Bear" and I passed out on the couch.  I never heard the buzzer so I woke up to smelly burnt pizza.  Thankfully, it wasn't burned that bad and B ate it but still!  I don't know how I slept through it...when B asked what happened I said, I must have not heard it while I was sleeping...he says, you must have been snoring so loud that I didn't hear it either.  HAHA!  So who knows what the deal was...but same thing last night.  Thankfully, I thought before we watched "Brother Bear" and didn't try to pre-make our gourmet meal.  Anyway...I am not so melancholy today.  I forgot something funny my stylist said yesterday.  She asked my if hubby knew I was coming and I said yes...is he excited?  I think so.  She says, "Oh, you know he so is...it is every man's porno fantasy."  I was laughing so hard...and yes, uptowngirl, I COMPLETELY agree...next time it is all gone.  She was just telling me she has not done much of that and the salon is having her attend more classes as it is becoming more common...so I figured it could wait until next time...lol!  So, perhaps in a couple months?    and yes, I think he was excited...he came home from work, skipping his running/workout, and tried to wake me up...I guess I was out cold so he just stripped me and I woke up to him on top of me...ahhh, what a beautiful way for a nymph to be woken...

      I'm in a melancholy mode...who knows why...just am.  Work is weird.  And to top it off, I have yet to hear if I was extended for July...okay, we are talking the day after tomorrow!  Ugh.  I'm not stressed about it, just annoyed.  I think if my PM's were fretting I would get worried...I'm sure they would drop massive hints if something was up.  I went and got a wax today...I thought it would be a "full removal" but I called in and asked for the Brazilian...I thought that is what my older sis said that meant...guess not.  It means one finger width is still left...damn!  I was really looking forward to being hairless.  Next time.  Oh, yeah...I also had to buy some cream because I am VERY prone to ingrown hairs...$34 DOLLARS!  15ml for THIRTY FOUR DOLLARS!  I am shocked.  My waxer offered me the small packet but I took the big tub, I mean, who knew?  So this venture cost me $80 after the tip...that will thrill the hubby!  Tomorrow I am going to get a pedicure and then next week I will get a fill in my fingernails...who knew being a girl was so much work?!  I have been going tanning almost everyday...oddly enough, I feel tan today...  Will my period come?  I need to do the monthly dance...don't get me wrong, skipping is cool...but I know I won't be that lucky.  If I don't have it before we go, guaranteed it will start while we are gone.  Yucky!  I'm going to go listen to Karen Carpenter...I'm in a mood...

      ahhhh...what weekends...I love them...but it makes Monday mornings especially brutal...  Friday...B was at VBS all week and Friday night was parents night.  Both hubby and I went.  First a bbq and then watching them.  They sang and then there were "Olympic" games...what a cluster!  The leaders didn't know what they were doing and the games were not entertaining even the youngest of kids!  It was an hour and a half of torture...we were SO glad when the games were over...but it was fun to see B so excited...he was so happy we were there and got to "see" him do his VBS thing.  After that, we ran to Sears to do some shopping.  Got B some clothes for soccer, hubby a swimsuit and some sandals.  Saturday morning we got up and went to Bob Evans for breakfast...yummy!  Then we continued shopping...yuck!  We went BACK to Sears...hubby didn't like his swimsuit and I exchanged some flip-flops at Ann Taylor.  Then we went on to Dunham's to buy B some cleats, shin guards, and socks for soccer camp.  Hubby got a swimsuit there...then on to Old Navy.  Hubby got another swimsuit and a sleeveless shirt...I found a tshirt.  Finally, we went home.  I told hubby, shopping with he and B is like shopping with two ADHD kids...they were constantly, "Sar look over here, mommy look what I found, mommy/Sar, mommy/Sar"  It was driving me mad!!!  I basically crashed when we got home...seriously...I was exhausted...got up, went tanning.  Why aren't I getting tanner than I am?  Do you stop having the ability to get tan the older you get?  It is very strange...after that, we got ready and went to M & J's housewarming/annual bbq party.    Their new house is beautiful...and a beautiful backyard and gardens as well.  M hired a woman to do facepainting and balloons for the kids...B had his face painted like a rainbow tiger, it was beautiful!  He looked like he was performing in CATS...seriously, it was awesome!  One of my friends, JL, was there...I haven't seen her since they moved to Ann Arbor.  She and M kept going on and on about how beautiful I looked...it was so nice to hear the first time but then I was just embarassed.  M says, you look like a movie star!  You look so awesome!  Then she would say to whoever was around her, isn't she just beautiful?  Her hair?  Her face?  Her whole package?  Just beautiful!  Seriously...I was mortified...  C was TERRIBLE!  He kept screaming because the kids were playing with his toys...duh...and, of course, M did nothing...J did nothing.  It was embarassing for them...and maddening for every other parent.  Hubby was so pissed by the time we left...I guess C had hit and pushed B a couple times...I only saw one push and I was all over him.  Hubby just could not believe M&J let him behave like that...it changed his opinion of them...I had told him this is how it was but he had never seen it before.  I doubt he will want to do things with them anymore...  Sunday...more sleeping.  I got up around 6:30am to make a list of what we need to do to sell the house...holy crap!  Not a bunch of "big" stuff but a full page, nonetheless!  We talked it over and decided to wait at least another year, probably two.  We have been looking at houses on a lake or have deeded lake access.  Hubby has always told me there was no way we could afford it...well, we can.  Not that it will be big and immaculate but the ones I found are a little larger than we have right now.  Definitely a realistic dream...I mean, if we don't have anymore children, we don't really need a larger house.  I would like a little bigger and would like a different floor plan but I am sure we will sacrifice some of our "wants" to be on a lake...both of us have ALWAYS wanted to be on a lake.  Man!  I can't wait.  But this will give me something to strive for...and hopefully help get my spending under wraps again...lol!  Made a big breakfast for all of us...I don't know what my deal is...I just want to eat pancakes...lol!  After that, I went to take a nap...then we did some quick grocery shopping and I bbq'd, or tried to.  Something is up with our grill because it was NOT cooking the meat.  I ended up having to use the George Foreman and hubby left late for work...ugh.  B and I watched "Brother Bear", I rearranged the kitchen counters, and that was the extent of my fun for the day...

      yippee!!!  I learned how to inhale!  Today was my first day back to running after getting an inhaler.  The dr said I need to have two puffs and wait twenty minutes...then I should be good to go.  Well, last time I had an inhaler, it did not work.  I could NOT inhale...sounds stupid, but it is true...same reason I couldn't learn to smoke in college, can't inhale.  Ironically, same reason Clinton explains he couldn't do pot or whatever drug, he could not inhale...anyways.  So, I wake up, psych myself up and did it PERFECTLY the first puff...it was so weird because I felt it.  The second puff didn't go quite as well, about halfway right...but still, quite progress!  Now, after taking a week off, I need to work up to where I was again, but I made it pretty far considering...probably tomorrow I will be able to pass this level and go to the next step.  Mary Kate...wow...can't say that I am surprised.  That girl was looking bad, worse than Lara Flynn...I don't really have much to say on the matter, just that I hope she is successful with the treatment and that she gets better...sending her all of my warm thoughts, along with many others, I'm sure...she is such a beautiful girl...I hope she learns to see that too...

      do you like to look back at how you have changed over the years?  It is pretty funny...I wouldn't say I was ever a "tomboy" per say...but when I was in high school I so did not care about "girly" things.  Sure, I liked to be all glammed up but I wasn't going to commit the hours that my "girlfriends" did to do so...I also didn't care about appearances...I wouldn't not play ball with my guy friends because I might get sweaty or messed up or dirty...  Now, I would say in the last couple years, I am turning into a complete girly-girl.  Not that I don't do things because I might get dirty but I LOVE pink (AHHHH!), I don't mind spending money on girly things anymore...actually, as of late, I have been in complete girly mode.  It started when C and I went to Chicago.  I got to go into Sephora for the first time.  Other than the madness of all the people, I LOVED it...but I couldn't decide what to buy after about 35minutes so I stopped torturing C and just left.  Now, I wish I had gotten their las vegas makeup bag.  Too cute!  I could order it online but I think hubby is about to kill me with all the purchases as of late...anyway...so I have been obsessing about girly things...add in my extra hormones the past week...  I was in Target yesterday filling my inhaler prescription...I got some cool "tools".  I got cuticle clippers (I have been DYING for some for over a year!), eyelash curlers (I decided about 3months ago I needed some), and, finally, my new love, a callous shaver...I don't know if that is the technical name but when I got the pedicure in Chicago, this woman used one to scrape off the nasty skin on the bottom of my feet...I was instantly in love!  I have been keeping an eye out for one but sephora.com was out and I hadn't found any in the stores.  I can't wait to use it!  Also, I have been wanting to stock up on more makeup.  Sadly, I have used the same types of makeup since college!  Appalling...I know.  SO, my friend started selling AVON and I decided to buy some stuff from her.  I know, not the highest quality but I need to figure out what I can deal with before I drop a buttload.  Also, I went to Marshall's and got a bigger makeup bag that will hopefully hold me over until I find the perfect big one.  THEN I went on eBay and bought this CD...it is put out by MAC and is supposed to show different ways to apply makeup.  This is what I have REALLY needed...the nice girls at Merle Norman tried to help me when I worked across the hall years ago but I don't really remember everything...plus, I would like some bold new ways to wear makeup...I cannot wait until it gets here!  Why am I feeling so girly?  In anticipation of my brazilian wax in a couple weeks?  Oh yeah, I also went and got an overlay on my nails last night...I'm a walking Hello Kitty...

      do you ever feel like you are two steps from being committed???  that's me...I always over-analyze myself, and, of course, it all takes place in my head...so, yeah, I think I'm nuts...  anyway...do you know how many pregnant people I know???  I know a bunch...I also know a load of people buying new houses...but that is not what I'm talking about right now...my older sis, her sister in law, her friend, my friend T, my PCOS friend A, and now S...not to mention all of those I know that JUST had babies.  It is weird because I would have thought that I would have issues with it...not really...I don't want to say that I am above that because that is NOT what I mean...I just mean that I haven't allowed myself to think there is even a remote possibility so I have moved on to find other meaning in my life beyond having babies.  I'm glad I feel this way...it isn't like me to be jealous of what other people have so it was a double whammy when I got all depressed AND was jealous...I just didn't like myself so much then because I felt I was just being bitch-y.  This weekend was nuts...seems to be the story of our life.  I feel like we are trying to cram in everything before we go on our cruise!  Friday, my parents had B overnight...hubby and I met his coworkers at Don Pablos for dinner and then went to Gary Fields Comedy Club.  We had never been there before and it was HALARIOUS!  I have not laughed that hard in a very long time...hubby was so nervous going into it because he thought I would not like his coworkers...I had met them at R's graduation party and they were so nice...but I think he was worried they would talk about work the entire time and I would feel left out.  They did talk about work A LOT but it doesn't bother me...I am so used to listening to hubby's stories and not having a clear understanding of everything he is telling me.  Plus, R's wife, J, is so sweet...they both are just very nice people.  We had a great time with them which was wonderful because since B and H's divorce we haven't really had a perfect match as couple friends... I take that back, we have T & J but they live in Indiana and we don't do things without the kids.  Anyway, J said she will find the schedule and we can plan a next time...I think each side passed the "friends" interview...lol!  We went to the early show with R&J so we got home a little after 10pm.  My sis has loaned us the Harry Potter movies so we decided to watch the first one.  I fell asleep for about 1/2 an hour but we both really like it.    Saturday we both slept in, got ready, and went tanning.  The owner was there so we talked to him about the best way to get hubby tan in three weeks, not going everyday.  He was really nice and gave us a great deal on a package and some new tan lotion.  He talked to me about how it was going for me since I come everyday...I told him, for some reason, I still wasn't getting much color!  That's when he sold me a different lotion that has accelerator in it and upgraded my bed.  He says, you are going to feel it burn but you aren't REALLY burning...  Well, he put me in the ultra-bed for 15 minutes...I was still getting pink at 10minutes in the regular bed!  And, boy, he wasn't kidding!  That shit made me hurt!!!  It burned and was on the verge of hurting..it was definitely NOT comfortable!  Then, I got out and everywhere I had put the lotion on was bright cherry red...it looked like I had fried!  The good news is, I did indeed get a lot of color...the bad news is, there are places that really did burn.  Like the back of my arms, the top of my thighs, the sides of my calves...very weird but whatever...I didn't go back yesterday but I think I might be okay to go today...  After tanning, we picked up B.  Then we headed to Cabela's.  It took a little over two hours but it was such a beautiful afternoon.  We spent three plus hours there and both hubby and B had a fabulous time...it was not as painful as I thought it would be but I definitely could have left at least an hour earlier!    Sunday was just lazy...I got up and went grocery shopping...it took forever because I hadn't gone for a couple weeks.  I have decided, I need to find a farmer's market.  I spent the majority of the grocery money on produce, including the $6.50 I spent for a bag of cherries!  Unbelievable!  So, I'm thinking I need to find somewhere to get some of the fresh produce cheaper.  Plus, it would probably taste better because it would be extra fresh!  Anyway, we had a bbq for hubby for Father's day and that was it...I crashed on the couch after lunch.  I was so tired...it is funny because I get irritated when I have to remind hubby that I can't go balls to the wall all the time and sometimes my body just crashes...but I forget too.  I slept for about three hours!  Thankfully B wanted to watch a movie so he was content just laying on the other couch while I was dead to the world...  Well...my boss is ooto this week so I guess that is why I felt the need to ramble so long.  I don't have much to do and am DREADING this week...I want to work extra so I have overtime for extra cash for vacation but I don't know if I can convince myself to stay!  This afternoon I have to leave a little early, I have my hearing test...the results should be interesting...

      lordy!  Please know, I do not purposefully put myself in the place of surrogate mother to my younger sisters...and sometimes my older one as well.  I have always thought that everyone thought I was crazy...I'm not convinced that my brother in law and older sis don't but I finally feel like maybe my sisters actually appreciate my brutal honesty...   when I had the infamous "talk" I definitely felt ostracized...I mean, how DARE I suggest that they may engage in the demons of alcohol or premarital sex...but at the same time, I didn't care...I NEEDED to say what I said for my own peace of mind.  Please know, I do not blame my parents for hubby and I getting pregnant before marriage, obviously, I made the decision to have sex.  BUT I think if I had not been as "responsible" and "mature" as I was, in some ways, I would have been a basketcase.  I think this is my issue with right-wingers...just because you teach someone safety doesn't mean they ever use it...have YOU ever used a fire extinguisher?  Do we NOT teach how to use one because that would just be inviting people to start fires?  OF COURSE NOT!  In my mind, birth control and alcohol awareness is the same thing...please teach kids the benefits of using a condom IN ADDITION to using birth control...please teach them about AIDs and other not so fun STDs that they are risk of getting...please teach them about alcohol...etc...it is important shit that if they aren't taught they will learn from experience, and perhaps, after it is too late...you can't just return AIDs to the store from whence it came...my point, I guess, is that if someone had been more honest with me about sex and alcohol and drugs, maybe I wouldn't have been so naive...maybe I would have...  Well, lil sis came to watch B for hubby and I...my mom usually has him in the summer on Wednesdays but since my uncle died, they were in Manistee.  Well, I get home from work and am talking to her as she is leaving...all of a sudden I see it, a HICKIE!  I was so shocked!  Now, I am even more shocked that I ever saw it...like I told hubby, it wasn't like I was scoping out her neck, it just isn't something I would have expected...plus, it really was not that big and she had makeup over it...well too bad for her!!!  It was pretty funny because I then went into my 50questions...who? what? where? when?  Of course, La was having none of it.  She just turned beat red...it was pretty halarious because it was like she saw my face the second I noticed the hickie and she turned beat red...so, I went to give her a hug goodbye and put her in a headlock...that's right...I need to patent this move!  She literally was stuck smashed in my face for about 15minutes until I was laughing so hard I let her wriggle free...she tried tickling, which I'm not ticklish...she tried yanking and pulling but it was a HOT move...still didn't get info out of her but, as I told her today, it is good to know I can kick her ass!  Now, I just need to defeat Lis and I'm back in the number one spot...trust me, I'll use my new signature move, it will be the only way!  Anyway...I called her this morning to talk to her.  I wanted to make clear I am not disappointed in her...I mean, in the grand scheme of things, it is a few broken vessels...plus, in the back of my head, I know I have gotten them from NOT so innocent things...I'm not disgusted...I'm not really anything.  I told her again...please use a condom...please use birth control...but especially the condom...told her I just worry about her and want her to be happy and with someone that deserves her and treats her right.  Asked her if he spent the night (come on, this is ME we are talking about!)and asked about her birthday.  SUPPOSEDLY, she told him no to the ecstacy...I pray she is being honest, I don't know that she would lie to me but at the same time, I don't know that she would want to admit that one either.  Told her I love her...told her I was available for a beating anytime she needed it!  HAHA...yeah, she loved that one!  Almost as much as when I ask her if this car is a keeper!  (Note...this girl has totalled TWO cars...within 2months of each other--and 2months is a generous figure)  Did you know the Simple Life started again?  Lordy!  Those girls crack me up...hubby wanted to get very philosophical last week about it...they are so rude, they are disrespectful, blah blah blah.  I apologized but said I did not want to get into a debate...I was trying to watch OPRAH!  Anyway, yeah, I know what he is saying and I agree last season was a little much...but at the same time, these girls have never wanted a thing their whole life plus, I am SURE they are used to being catered to by everyone...I think this explains some of it...tangent!    Sorry...so, I watched both episodes last night...halarious!  I felt bad for Paris...who wants to forever watch on tv falling off a horse?!  But I love Nicole.  I love her new word "hot"...ie, no swearing in front of Kayla.  Paris says, "nicole?"  Nicole says, "What? Oh yeah, that's hot"  HAHA!  Cut to her trying to get this little girl to say ass or bitch...too funny!  I have to give Nicole credit...everyone was SO rude about her looks last year...I think she is pretty plus she lets Paris have the spotlight and just rolls with it...it so reminds me of my friendship with S...I told her we need to pitch a spinoff where we roam around the states as two 20-something mothers on the hunt for a good time...I'm sure it would be just as amusing...

      ugh...why does it seem this week is just dragging?  can it be Friday yet???  My Uncle Fran died this week...well, he was really my great uncle.  I knew him but I didn't know him well.  He lives in Manistee and, well, we hardly ever went up there.  He had cancer so I am glad the pain has stopped.  I'm not going to pretend I am devastated because I really don't know him...but I always feel sad when another family member dies.  It reminds me how little I know about my extended family.  It started a conversation with my mom about my dad's side.  Who was related how...it also brought up that my dad's side has the possibility of the cancer gene as well.  Well, that is great to know...my dad won't go get tested even though his dad, his grandfather, and now his uncle have all died from cancer.  His grandfather and dad had prostate cancer!  How I never knew this, I don't know...but I think it is VERY important to know for B's sake.    It just has me thinking about all the probability that I have the mutated gene.  J escaped but I have always been the mutant health-wise in the family.  So why should this be any different?!  I know I haven't been prepared thus far to find out...but maybe next year.  I am at the beginning of a road...I feel good.  Yeah, I know my body is still messed up but I feel that I have finally adapted a lifestyle in which I am doing all that I can to help myself.  I am taking my meds almost religiously (I forget once in a blue moon), I am watching my diet and eating mostly fresh veggies and fruit, and, the kicker, I am excercising regularly.  Other than adding in a multivitamin, I've done my part...now the meds need to start doing their part and my body needs to wake up...  I also am back at a place where I am not obsessing about baby...do I still want another one?  Most definitely!  But, I'm not beating myself up nor am I mourning something I may never have...I'm back where I can say, if it is meant to be, it will happen.  I'm back to the place where I can see how much I love hubby and B and know that our family is such a blessing and more than some people have in a lifetime.  I'm content with the way things are...    Sometimes, I think by not taking care of my body, I was hoping a baby would come and then it wouldn't be that big of a deal..does that make sense?  I just feel that if I whip myself back into shape and THEN get pregnant, I will end up totally out of whack again.  Having B sent my body over the edge and I don't want that to happen again...obviously, if I did get pregnant, they know what I have now and I am on meds for it so it may not cause havoc...but it may.  I guess that is selfish of me but if I'm doing all this work, I don't want to end up back at square one or at square negative fifty!  Anyway, my whole ramble was started because, I think, if I continue on the right path, I will just get stronger and stronger.  It has been a year since I found out I have PCOS, so next year will be two.  If I am still mentally healthy in dealing with it and not just shoving it on the back burner, I think I will be mentally prepared to find out about the gene.  It is weird...I have always assumed I have it so I don't really know why I want to get tested.  Except, that is one more thing I will need to see specialists about and have tests, etc...I will need to stay on top of it.  My mom read me an article with the statistics...basically, by 60 years old, 87% of the women with the gene have produced cancer.  That is frightening!  I need to have the test done so, if I have the gene, I can have the tests to help keep an eye on my body.  Right now, my gyn told me he can't get insurance to pay for anything because they will see me as too young...bastards.  So, now that I am feeling pretty good about the PCOS, I need to start preparing myself to take the test.  I can't imagine how weird it would feel if I found out I don't have the gene...I have never really given much thought to that possibility...  Enough on the philosophical...B has to have his adenoids removed.  The Dr explained it is relatively easy surgery and does not have the pain associated with tonsil removal.  Both hubby and I agree we need to do this...we do NOT want him to get an infection in the sphenoid again.  I know B will be a trooper about it but it doesn't lower the worry factor!  We are looking at the end of July...hopefully it will work out because that will be after we get back from our cruise and before the NASCAR races.  I do NOT want to miss the races...not for me, but B has been told for about a year he could go with his dad and gramps and I know he is excited...I just don't think that would be fair to do to him.

      I feel so icky...do veggie-dogs go bad???  I have had some in the freezer for FOREVER...well, last night, I needed something hot to eat.  I don't know how people do the microbiotic diet.  I just get to a point where, even if I am really not, I need to FEEL like I am eating a real meal.  It HAS to be hot...or at least have been cooked and been hot at some point before I eat it...  Anyway, a couple nights ago, I decided to have a veggie-dog.  So, I took them out of the freezer to let them thaw from the freezer burn...well, I ended up running and it was so dang hot that the last thing I wanted to do was eat.  So, I just threw them in the fridge.  Last night, I wanted a hot meal so bad...add on top of that, I was starving because I had only had a muffin and a bowl of cereal...so, I am scrounging looking for something to be hot and quick but not blow my caloric intake...enter veggie-dogs.  So, I ate BOTH of them on 100 calorie buns.  Not bad in the diet department.  However, this morning I feel like crap!  I got up with a stomach ache which is now just nausea...I am SUCH a baby when it comes to that...I hate the thought of regurgitating...I will hold off as long as possible.  Right now, it is coming in waves...lordy!  Please let this day go by fast!!!  On an up-note...we meet with the ENT today.  I will be interested to hear why the PA thought B needs his adenoids removed.  I am praying overtime there is another approach...

      OHMIGOSH!!!  We have just gotten the best news in a LOOOOONG time!  Hubby has been planning to go to school in the fall to become recertified.  The police academy lasts two semesters so we have been AGONIZING over what to do...do I keep working?  does B go to daycare full time?  do I quit and stay home?  We had yet to come to a decision because we have been going round and round...  Well, yesterday, hubby had an appointment with the director of the program.  She mentioned he needed to call the MCOLES department.  She thought the certification requirements had been changed and since he was already certified once, he possibly would not have to go through the academy again.  Well, needless to say, he was so excited and hopeful but I tried to stay calm because we both figured, with our luck, it wouldn't go that way...  So, he tried to get ahold of someone at MCOLES but the woman he needed to talk to was not available.  He spoke to a guy there who agreed that he did not think he would need to go back through the academy...  So, today, the woman calls and tells him he is good to go!  He needs to pass the physical test and then he will need to attend an 8 day training class.  After that, he will need to take the state certification test and then he will be recertified!  I CANNOT BELIEVE IT!!!  We are both so ecstatic!  I guess after 9/11, the state had to take a look at the requirements and decided if someone had gone through an academy and been certified previously, they should not have to go through an academy again, just the "refresher".  Words cannot even describe what a huge relief this is and what a burden of stress has been lifted off both our shoulders...  I am so happy and excited for him...he wants to try to go to the training in August.  It will require some serious dedication and hammering done on his part but I think it is doable.  If he doesn't get his stuff done by August than there will be another one in October.  I told him I'm nervous because that means he could be on the road by the end of the year but I know how happy it will make him...keep your fingers crossed!

      yes, I am done freaking out...the PA called back today...I told her we would prefer to see the dr, to which she said, fine but she isn't available until middle to late July.  Fine, no rush.  Well, when I called to make an appointment with the dr, we got an appointment for this FRIDAY!  I am so not impressed with this chickie...but we do like the dr so hopefully she got a clue and won't be calling back!  Other than that...not much new.  It was so freakin' hot last night!  I have this weird thing about trying not to turn on the air until July but I broke.  I was laying on the couch resting and trying to convince myself to go downstairs and run...well, just laying there, I was dripping sweat, I HATE to sweat!  So, I went down for a run and was filling a small pool with my sweat...so, when i came back upstairs I turned on the air.  I am so bad about remembering the cover!  It took me an hour to remember...I realized the air was not pumping in cold air and then it dawned on me...duh!    So, when I put B to bed I told him to just sleep in his undies since it was still so hot upstairs (over 90 degrees!!!)...he says, can I just sleep in my butt...I burst out laughing!  It was so halariously cute!  So the air is on and I am B-less tonight...

      okay...I'm officially freaking!  B had his allergist appointment last Thursday, it turned up negative for any allergies.  So, yesterday, I called the ENT doctor to see if she had seen his CAT scan and what conclusions, if any, she had come to since he has no allergies.  Well, the bastards called back at work when I had left our home phone (I had to leave early yesterday, which I knew!) and left me a message that we need to schedule a PRE-OP appointment...as in PRE-OPERATION!!!  So nice of this frickin' PA to leave a message telling me my son's adenoids need to come out!  So, now, I have to wait until later this morning to call them back and try to talk to them about it...quite frankly, I want a second opinion...I am not inclined to take your word for it when I have only met you once and this is my only child we are talking about!  And, actually, the PA wants to meet with us, not the Dr...oh, I'm sorry, the dr is too busy to meet with us unless she is OPERATING on my four year old?!  Okay...I know, I'm being a bit irrational but I hate dr's and I just think this situation could have been handled a lot better...ie, "Hi, returning your call, we have some conclusions we would like to discuss, please call us back at your earliest convenience!"

      man, I hate Monday mornings...I don't know why because there is no one here to bug me...I think it is just the thought that, had it still been the weekend, I would not be here...but since it is Monday morning, I am sitting at my desk procrastinating at 7am!  Well, our weekend was good...the Greek Festival on Friday and T&J on Saturday.  I forget how much I miss T until I spend time with her...she has got to be the one girl that I could guarantee I will always be friends with.  She knows me so well and she is not into the petty/catty bs other girlfriends are into...needless to say, I hated it when they had to leave.  And K is such a little gem!  She was cracking me up even though she barely said anything!  She is a strange mixture of complete girly and tomboy...it is funny to watch...Sunday we went to see grandma.  Well, I hate to say it but she drives me nutso sometimes.  I know it is terrible...I know...but she lays on these massive guilt trips.  I just want to scream, do you understand I work???  It is major frustration and add to that the fact she is losing her mind and she was telling these crazy stories about B and others about my dad.  I feel bad but I just didn't have patience for it yesterday...before everyone here slays me, I am consciously going to try to see her more often and I do love her very much...  On a more not upbeat note...I have had two very deep conversations with both of my younger sisters.  The first was on Thursday night...B and I went to my parents to drop off some baby paraphenalia for my older sis.  They were going to see her NY and I wanted to send some bigger stuff with them so I wouldn't have to ship it.  Well, L and I got talking...her opening line???  Have you ever tried ecstacy?  After I lifted my jaw off the table, I said, no...the one thing I have never tried would be drugs.  Well, this loser of a guy she is "dating" (mind you, she says HE told her they were dating) wants to give her some for her birthday.  Supposedly, she told him no but he is insisting.  She said she doesn't know what to do because she doesn't want him to get mad because he spent so much money on it... EXCUSE ME?!?!  So, I just busted out the, have you had sex before?  To which she said, yes...are you currently?  No...I couldn't get too much out of her...no condom, no birth control...but I couldn't get much else out, she said it really wasn't her choice that they didn't use a condom...again, what?!?!  I asked her if she was telling me she was raped...she said no...were you conscious? Yes...were you trashed?  I don't remember what she said...she said it was a one time deal and she has been beating herself up about it.  Lordy...there was so much I needed to say to this girl...considering my parents were lurking, I knew my time was limited...so I started...you need to wear a condom, not only will it protect you from pregnancy but it will also protect you from most other std's that you SURELY do not want, not excluding AIDs...drugs, I understand people do them, I understand people think they are okay...knowing MANY people who have done a variety of things, I don't buy it...God only gives you so many brain cells and why waste them...not to mention, you don't know who got what where and what they put into it...unless you are growing it yourself, it isn't 100% assured it is what you think it is...not that I am advocating growth, because that will get you locked up...as for beating yourself up, if you think you made a mistake, step back, analyze what happened and why you did it, and learn from it...life is too short to live with regrets and all we can do is live life the best way we can...  Well...obviously, she is beating herself up because of what my parents would think.  I told her, there has to come a point in your life where you look at what mom and dad taught us and accept and reject the principles to adapt your own...you cannot live your entire life for mom and dad because, no matter what, they will find something that could be better.  She completely agreed but said that it was a lot easier coming from me considering I never cared what they thought of me...I kind of laughed and said, well I don't now but I did...in high school I drove myself nuts trying to please them but I was coming behind the girl they deem "perfect" so, like I said, nothing was going to make them happy...when I graduated high school, I gave them the proverbial finger and went about my own business.  It wasn't until I was out on my own in Chicago that I completely made all of my decisions.  On top of that, I basically showed through my actions that if mom wanted to lay guilt trips, I would have nothing to do with her.  I think she finally got the picture that I was never going to be her idea of what I should be and gave up...to move on to the next sister, I'm sure.  I also told L that I would be lying if I said I still don't get hurt by it...I told her, it is hard to listen to everyone else's shining moments and then, here's B.  I don't even get introduced, B does.  It is like I don't exist except to be B's mom...it hurts because everyone else's parents thought I was the berries...I got good grades, I kept clean, for the most part...but my parents thought I was the spawn of Satan.  Then my dad came home with the dinner...I need to get together with her to finish it up...  Then, Friday, I went out to lunch with Lis.  She started talking about L and how she thought this supposed boyfriend of hers was a real something or other...I don't remember what she called him but it cracked me up.  I guess L went to see him ALL day and used some phony friend as an alibi...I mean, the friend does exist but she hasn't seen her for YEARS.  Well, Lis started talking about all of her issues...I guess I got this look on my face and she asked me what I was thinking.  I just told her I was so worried about her and L.  I told her I didn't understand where they were coming from because I never cared what my friends were doing, I just didn't feel the need to do something I didn't want to do to fit in.  I have never completely fit in anywhere so I got used to it very early and just decided what I wanted to do and what I didn't want to do...well, I basically busted out, are you still smoking pot?  No...I don't think I asked the sex question...unusual, I know but I didn't.  I told her, just as I told L, I am NOT judging you...it is your life and you have to make your own decisions and your own mistakes...I just wish that my mistakes could have been lessons for you guys so you don't have to go through the same heartache that I did...I am trying to take the same approach with you that I take with B...yes, I would prefer you guys didn't do this stuff, but I would much rather KNOW and be able to be there for you guys then never know and be blindsided by it someday.  She also talked about being on antidepressants...I just hope I got through to one of them...I pray I got through to both...I worry about them so much.  And I kind of feel like I am the only one that can talk openly to them and yet try to be there...I know they aren't telling J this stuff...she would probably pass out from it all...I know she means well but I also understand when they say they can't talk to her because she doesn't get it.  Her biggest "vice" was being taught how to play poker in college!  Sinner!  Anyway...I try not to worry, try just to be concerned...and I need to make a mental list, I need to be there and need to reach out to them more often...I'm very very bad at that but it is not an excuse...I need to let them know I love them and I'm here for them, no matter what...

      what a weekend...Friday, hubby and B went to TC so I was home alone.  I decided to get a little bit of cleaning/organizing done.  Well, I have not been satisfied with the way our living room is situated...so I tried moving the couches until I found a better way...none to be found.  But we now have a new gauge in the floor...yippee!!!   Please note sarcasm    Saturday, C and I headed to Chicago for the day...they had a memorial day parade right in front of our hotel so we had to find our way around it...lol!  Then we went to our room...the world's tiniest hotel room!  They did not have a room with two twin beds yet since we were checking in so early...yuck! I was not looking forward to sleeping in the same bed (I'm weird about that) but I figured it was one night, I could deal.  We shopped ALL day.  We walked all of North Michigan and went in all malls and many shops...it is kind of funny actually since neither of us particularly like to shop!  I hit up H&M...LOVE that store!  I got a ton of cute stuff for the cruise and with the gift certificate from my older sis, hardly spent any $$$!  We walked down State but didn't go down far enough for the cute little shops.  But we did run into a nail store so we stopped and I got a MUCH needed pedicure and she got her nails done.  I have never had such a good pedicure.  She took off the yucky skin and massaged my feet and calves...it felt AWESOME!!!  That night, we went to dinner and tried to go to this bar "Leg Room"...very cool inside but we were just to early so we beat the crowd.  Then we walked down to Excalibur...same thing, too early.  So we ended up at Hard Rock and had a drink and went to the hotel to bed...haha!  We were both laughing about what old women we are... next time, I would probably do TWO nights so if we have to spend all day shopping we don't have to party the same night...  Anyway...Monday, B and I tried to go to Shrek II but it was all sold out...we went on Tuesday, it was cute but I'm still a fan of Disney movies...lol!  Weird that I feel I have to state my loyalties...it is JUST a cartoon!  I started this running program.  According to the schedule, I will be running 3miles in 30days...well, I'll believe it when I do it.  I was going to do it outside but that requires me to buy a pedometer so I know how many times around the park is a mile...too much effort.  So, I am doing it on the treadmill...so far so good.  I mean, my bursitis and my knee are killing me, of course, but I am DETERMINED to do this.  I told hubby, it is my sincerest wish that on our cruise we can run together.  Doesn't that seem romantic?  Running on the beaches of Miami?  I just see it as something we can do together and is good for us.  Hubby is slimming down rapidly.  I'm envious...proud, but envious.  I keep trying to convince myself, I am doing this for my health and I probably won't lose any weight...but I know deep down, I see this as my last ditch effort to rid myself of these pounds.  Hopefully, by the time I admit to myself this weight isn't going away, the program will be a habit so I will keep with it...I have to admit, it is kind of cool to use my body...

      Hmmm...I have been pretty hormonal this past few days...mind you, I did actually start a cycle on the 26th but I don't think all of my emotional turmoil can be chalked up to that...  I will admit it...I think I am more upset and pissed by my inlaws than I am trying to pass off.  Why won't I just admit this?  Because if I do, hubby will ask me what I want him to do about it...which makes me feel, if there is nothing to do about it, what is the point in being upset?  Which I agree with but I don't...am I making any sense??? Yeah, I didn't think so.  Okay...so, what I'm upset about...WHY do they treat me like crap?  I mean, I know I'm not blood but I am still technically "family"...I am married to their son and mother of their grandson...I just don't get it.  Is it me?  Is it because they are just rude and ignorant?  I think if I knew the WHY of it all it would be easier for me to deal with...would it make it any less hurtful?  No...but I would be able to say, okay, they are doing this because they are XXXX.  But I don't have that...right now, all it feels like is that they mercilessly poke and prode to see how far they can push me.  And what do I do?  They are FAMILY...I can't cut them out of my life...they are too important to my hubby and to my son.  Say something?  I've already tried that route...that ended up with everyone pointing their fingers at me...everytime they do or say something, it takes me a little longer to get over it.  I hate this feeling...  Then the baby thing...I want one.  I am once again at the place where I am contemplating clomid.  Ugh...I make a decision I think I am at peace with and then I step back to re-make the decision.  Hubby says he doesn't think he is ready to try it...well, that makes me mad too.  He would not have to DO anything...except things he already does.  I also want to ask him to go get tested.  Part of me feels like I wouldn't obsess about this if I knew he was partly to blame too...part of me also feels like if he did have some issues, he could make some easy adjustments to increase our chances.  Ultimately, though...I KNOW that if it was meant to be, it will happen.  I won't HAVE to do anything else...if it was meant to be...so, I think I am ultimately struggling with the WHY isn't it meant to be...  I think if I was not so nosey about life in general...I would not have any of these questions and the voices in my head would not be leading me to a migraine...

      yes, I realize...this is the 3rd post of the day.&nbsp; I AM BORED!&nbsp; I wouldn't be bored if the "help" desk would get a techy over here to fix this computer.&nbsp; Ironically, I can get on to blogger without issue...if I attempted to get onto a site that actually was to do with my work, it would lock up.&nbsp; I have shut-down and re-booted this computer at least 6 times today...hence, three postings in the matter of hours.  My new topic.&nbsp; Have&nbsp;I mentioned I know someone on the verge of being famous?&nbsp; Not my older sis who was an attorney at the law firm that represents Monica Lewinsky and Koch (former People's Court judge) works at...and, yes, she has met Monica.&nbsp; Now, she works for the firm handling the WorldCom case.&nbsp; Nope, my beautiful friend Kate has signed a contract to publish one of her books!&nbsp; I am so excited for her!&nbsp; It won't actually be published for a year...it takes that long for revising, editing, typesetting, etc.&nbsp; However, once it does get published, it will be available in local bookstores (in the US and Canada) and on Amazon.com!!!&nbsp; So, folks, mark your calendars for a year and look up "Kate Rizor" on Amazon.&nbsp; Now that I say that, search Katherine as well...I don't know which she will publish under.&nbsp; Heck, look her up now because you probably will get her business site.&nbsp; Just know, you heard about her here first...one of her biggest fans!&nbsp; And, if you come to one of her book signings, you will most likely find me there.&nbsp; No, really.&nbsp; I told her she needs to put her photo on the back of her book...she just laughed.&nbsp; I also told her to promise I get to be in the movie version...she laughed so hard I think frozen yogurt came out her nose.&nbsp; Anyway, I have read a lot of books...and I read them to the end because I can't stand not knowing that the ending didn't justify the shitty writing to get there.&nbsp; This one will be good...I haven't read the final cut, yet, but the beginning is great!  Anyway...Kate (Katherine) Rizor...Amazon...one year...

      wow...did you watch Amish in the City?&nbsp; Unbelievable.&nbsp; Did they purposefully find the rudest, most self-absorbed, immature "city" kids they could find?!&nbsp; I was SO disgusted by all of them...I mean, we are in 2004, right?!&nbsp; Imagine with me, we replace the "Amish" with inner-city black kids who also have never experienced this because they live in the projects...can you imagine the outrage that would be screamed from the rooftops.&nbsp; What an unbelievable showcase of prejudice!  I just found it so sad.&nbsp; I mean, what an awesome opportunity that would have been to show these kids the BEST parts of our culture.&nbsp; It was so cute to watch them...I felt so bad for how terribly they were treated.&nbsp; They were just good, honest kids that were curious about a different way of life.&nbsp; It shows how open they truly are and how close-minded Americans can still be.&nbsp; However, I would dare say, the producers did this on purpose.&nbsp; I mean, was there a kind hearted person in the bunch?&nbsp; NO ONE stood up and say, hey, get a grip, these kids don't know what's going on...instead of mocking them, let's help them.&nbsp; And Mose...my heart was truly bleeding for him.&nbsp; He was trying so hard to get these kids to accept him.&nbsp; It pained me but I couldn't turn it off.&nbsp;&nbsp; It so reminded me of junior high all over again.&nbsp; I wanted to go smack those kids upside the head!&nbsp; His toys were very cool...and I felt so bad when he thought he was drowning (which I think, he really could have been).&nbsp; I have had the experience of taking someone to Lake Michigan for the first time...they had only ever been in small lakes and pools...it is VERY intimidating to someone who did not grow up in that kind of water to see these huge waves coming at you and over you.&nbsp; And, let's face it, people DO drown in oceans and lakes like that.&nbsp; UGH!&nbsp; Can you tell how outraged I was???&nbsp; Mose is the one that really got to me...especially when they were showing him reading his Bible and praying.&nbsp; I didn't realize the Amish believe if you are out of the Amish and die you go to hell...what a burden.&nbsp; And pretty amazing to me that he left if he really believes that.&nbsp;   Anyway, the end result...the Amish kids are really cool and people I would actually be friends with.&nbsp; The city kids...desperately need to grow up and experience the outside world.&nbsp; Pretty weird considering the premise, eh?

      My dear friend, Anne, sent this to me.&nbsp; It is so completely true.&nbsp; Hubby and I go round and round because he sees all the things we DON'T have and I focus on all the things we do have.&nbsp; Gratitude and thankfulness can change your outlook on life drastically...I know it helped me change mine.&nbsp; The health comment touched me tremendously.&nbsp; This is one huge area of my life where I need to spend more time being thankful...    A newly arrived soul in Heaven was met by St. Peter. &nbsp;St. Peter and the soul took the a tour around Heaven. They walked&nbsp;side-by-side inside a large workroom filled with angels.     &nbsp;  St. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter stopped in front of the first section and said, "This is the Receiving Section. Here, all petitions to God&nbsp;said in prayer are received."&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul looked at the section, and it was terribly busy with so&nbsp;many angels sorting out petitions written on voluminous paper&nbsp;sheets and scraps from people all over the world.     &nbsp;  They continued&nbsp;on until they reached the second section. St. Peter told the soul,&nbsp;"This is the Packaging and Delivery Section. Here, the graces and&nbsp;blessings the people asked for are processed and delivered&nbsp;to the living persons who asked for them."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The soul noted again how busy it was. There were many angels&nbsp;working hard at that station, since so many blessings had been&nbsp;requested and were being packaged for delivery to Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Finally at the farthest corner of the room, the soul stopped at a very&nbsp;small station. To the surprise of the soul, only one angel was seated&nbsp;there, idly doing nothing. "This is the Acknowledgment Section,"&nbsp; St. Peter told the soul.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How is it that? There's no work here?"&nbsp;&nbsp;"So sad," St. Peter sighed. "After people receive the blessings&nbsp;they asked for, very few send acknowledgments."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  "How does one acknowledge God's blessings?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Simple," St. Peter answered. "Just say, "'Thank you, Lord.'"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "What blessings should they aknowledge?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "If you have food in the refrigerator, clothes on your back, a roof &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overhead and a place to sleep ... you are richer than 75% of this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "If you have money in the bank, in your wallet, and spare change&nbsp; in a dish ... you are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "And if you get this on your own computer, you are part of&nbsp;the 1% in the world who has that opportunity."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Also . . ."If you woke up this morning with more health than illness ..... you are more blessed than the millions who will not even survive this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "If you have never experienced the fear in battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the agony of torture, or the pangs of&nbsp;starvation ..... you are ahead of 700 million people in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  "If you can attend a church meeting without fear of harassment,&nbsp;arrest, torture, or death ... you are envied by, and more&nbsp;blessed than, three billion people in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "If your parents are still alive and still married ... you are very rare.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "If you can hold your head up and smile, you are not the norm, you are unique to all those in doubt and despair."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  "OK, what now? How can I start?"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  "If you can read this message, you just received a double blessing in that someone was thinking of you as very special, and, you are more blessed than over two billion people in the world who cannot read at all."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;  Have a good day, count your blessings, and if you want, pass this&nbsp;along to remind everyone else how blessed we all are.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     &nbsp;  Attn: Acknowledge Dept.: Thank You for&nbsp;giving me the ability to share this message and for giving&nbsp;me so many wonderful people to share it with."&nbsp;

      hmmm...I forgot to mention.&nbsp; I got a new cd.&nbsp; Kevin Lyttle.&nbsp; He sings "Turn Me On"...very island-ish.&nbsp; I LOVE that song.&nbsp; I have listened to the whole cd once, it has potential...but it is all very island beat-ish.&nbsp; I know that isn't for everyone but I like it.  oh yeah, I did exchange my Gavin DeGraw (have I mentioned Gavin was a serious contendor for B's name?).&nbsp; I'm glad I waited.&nbsp; It has a live cd in it as the added bonus...I really love live cd's...his also has potential.&nbsp; I've listened to it a couple times...I think I'm just still hung up on George (they re-ran his Oprah yesterday...again, yummy!)...haha!

      ohmigosh!!!&nbsp; I just got one of the best calls of my life and I'm about to cry!&nbsp; One of my best friends, C, is PREGNANT!!!&nbsp; Please keep her in your thoughts and prayers that she will have no problems...see, C has been trying to get pregnant for as long as I have known her, three years.&nbsp; Seriously, this girl has done everything, chlomid, ovarian drilling.&nbsp; She was trying a new round of chlomid mixed with met (I had told her I read there was higher success with the two) and then, if that didn't work, she was going to try invitro.&nbsp; The real kicker was the dr's could not find out what was wrong...so she didn't have a face to what she was fighting against.  Anyway...she said she started cramping and her hubby said she should take a hpt.&nbsp; Well, she did (Sunday morning) and she said it was positive...she started balling.&nbsp; Of course, she didn't believe it because she had a shot of hcg (?) and figured it was that.&nbsp; So, she didn't tell her hubby and scheduled a blood test with her fertility dr.&nbsp; The blood test came back positive!&nbsp; The dr told her it wouldn't be the hormone shot because that was out of her system a few weeks ago.  So, she went and bought "What to expect when you're expecting" and gave it to her hubby...he, of course, was ecstatic.&nbsp; She is still stressed out.&nbsp; I think when you go through what she has to get pregnant, you know worst case scenarios for everything and expect them since, up to this point, you have experienced all worst cases.&nbsp; I tried to calm her and tell her it is okay she isn't feeling sick yet, she is figuring she is six weeks.&nbsp; I know I didn't find out I was pregnant until 8weeks and that was because I woke up with sore breasts...it wasn't until after that the morning sickness hit.&nbsp; I think it comforted her a bit...I was more concerned when she said she was cramping but didn't say anything.&nbsp; We talked about what the book said, it says the cramping is caused by the uterus enlargening and her nurse confirmed that.&nbsp; Whew...  She doesn't want anyone to know until after her first trimester...very understandable.&nbsp; So, only her drs, hubby, and I know...I feel so extremely honored...being the wonderful friend she is, she asked me how I was doing with the news, hoping she didn't depress me.&nbsp; Oh, of course not...I am so so very happy for her...I think she is going to be one of the best moms I know.&nbsp; I know what heartache she has gone through, just wanting a baby so much...I could not be any happier.&nbsp; I tried to tell her this, of course, I don't think she believed me.&nbsp; I seriously have had to deal with this so much this year, it isn't as painful as it used to be.&nbsp; Plus, like I said, I have been praying for her so much, I never gave myself a thought during the conversation...she said, well, if I end up having just one, maybe that will encourage S to let you try chlomid.&nbsp; Haha...I told her, no way, we are shooting for 6 here.&nbsp; (Her test for the hcg shot had shown 2 perfect eggs, 1 other that looked okay).&nbsp; She told me that her eggs could actually split into 3's!!!&nbsp; I said, well, than I'm praying for 9!!!  Anyway...I had to share somewhere, just don't tell anyone else!  And, remember, pray your little hearts out...I have never known someone more deserving...I promise.

      lordy...I so do not feel like working.&nbsp; Fortunately, I get to leave at 2pm today.&nbsp; Our sitter is on vacation still (she will be gone a total of 2 1/2 BUSINESS weeks!!!), which is a pain since we don't really have a back-up.&nbsp; La watched&nbsp; B all week last week for us.&nbsp; My mom watched him yesterday and will watch him tomorrow and Thursday, if she remembers, but wanted today off.&nbsp; So, I'm taking off...plus I will have Friday off for his surgery so I will be fortunate if I don't get axed for excessive time off!!!&nbsp; And, no, I'm not really joking...  Anyway, I have to go back to Target.&nbsp; I swear that place is a racket.&nbsp; I was there yesterday to fill my 2nd asthma prescription.&nbsp; I have been waiting for their $10 gift card coupon...I found it on Sunday...yippee!&nbsp; I also wanted to pick up toys for B for his surgery.&nbsp; I got a cool Spiderman "doll" that is super-poseable...plus, it was on clearance for half off!&nbsp; He is majorly into Spidey right now, though he hasn't seen the movies or cartoons since there is violence we don't condone for a four year old.&nbsp; Anyway...got a spirograph,&nbsp;a viewmaster and TONS of extra disks, and a Spiderman tshirt for him to wear to surgery.&nbsp; LONG ramble...so, they had Gavin Degraw advertised.&nbsp; I picked up the cd and was charged full price.&nbsp; So I walked my hiney to customer service...well, I guess there is a 2nd cd from Gavin, also named Chariot, that does not come out until TODAY.&nbsp; So, I have to take the cd I bought yesterday and return it for that one...I could have just kept the original but the new one has 2 cds so I would MUCH rather just wait to open it up...keep your fingers&nbsp;crossed that it is in stock.  Why am I in such a cd mode?&nbsp; Not sure...but I haven't been keeping up with my cd list either.&nbsp; I will have to visit that and see if I can fill in the blanks...

      ok...so, I am driving myself crazy...it takes quite a lot of talent to do that!&nbsp;   The issue...my hair.&nbsp; It is driving me NUTS!&nbsp; I have really long hair, past the middle back.&nbsp; My original goal was to grow it to my waistline but this is the problem, I have natural wave.&nbsp; So, basically, I wash, blowdry to straighten, and then hot roll it.&nbsp; Do this every morning and you understand why I am going nuts.&nbsp; Then add the fact that the humidity cancels out all the work and I'm back to funkedified wave...so, like today, by the time I walk into work, it looks funky.&nbsp; ugh.&nbsp; So, I am considering getting my haircut...off.  A) I think hubby will be happy because he likes it shorter but not too short B) I don't know what kind of hairstyle to get because I have mostly had long hair my whole life...except when I was actually skinny and could get away with short hair C) my face is round so I never know what kind of style looks good  So, I am back to looking up Tiffany Amber Thiessen hairstyles...her face is the most like mine shape-wise...I think I will walk in (I made an appointment for Saturday) and tell my stylist I need a change, have a few pictures, and see what she thinks.&nbsp; That is how I usually do it and there have only been a couple disasters...  great, my sister's shower is in two weeks...I know I'll hate my hair and see all kinds of people I never see and look crazy...  I need to get back to running...I got the second asthma med yesterday, started today...so by the time I'm back up in the running I should be okay...today: walking one mile...god give me some inspiration!  oh, and I need to figure out how to get my nose ring out so I can change it and potentially leave it out sometimes...

      so, we went to the inlaws this weekend...it was interesting.&nbsp; Supposedly, my bil and sil were NOT talking to my mil.&nbsp; Well, hubby and I volunteered to babysit so they could have some "alone" time before sil goes back to work.&nbsp; So, we get up there, call them and they don't want to go out...they would rather spend the time with us.&nbsp; Well, they did not get a "formal" invite to dinner so hubby acted as middle man to arrange it all.&nbsp; They come over, we all have dinner, everything seems hunky-dorey.  I notice that evening, sil seems inattentive when it comes to L.&nbsp; I didn't want to pass judgement so I thought maybe it was just the crap with my mil.&nbsp; who knows?   Saturday we get up and get ready to go out on the boat.&nbsp; Sil says she will catch up with us later.&nbsp; We go out.&nbsp; Why do we always have to bring both boats???&nbsp; It makes for a very awkward time.&nbsp; Do we ride with dad or brother?&nbsp; So, hubby and I ride with my bil and send B with mil and fil.&nbsp; Mind you, I am still not feeling quite right...hubby tells everyone I have been having issues with my stomach.&nbsp; Umm...great!&nbsp; So now, everyone looks at me like I'm about to crap my pants...how halarious...  We stay out for quite some time...sil calls, still not on her way.&nbsp; By the time she got there, everyone else is ready to go but we stay out for a while longer.&nbsp; I start feeling awful so sil, mil, L, and I pack up while the guys get the boats in.&nbsp; We head out to the pizza place to order pizza.&nbsp; L starts screaming at the top of her lungs...not a whimper, full-fledge screaming.&nbsp; Sil just ignores it.&nbsp; She goes in to order the pizza and L is SHRIEKING...I mean, the baby is 9weeks old but I think she is about to pass out from how hard she is crying.&nbsp; Sil gets back in the car and continues to ignore.&nbsp;   So, we get dropped off at inlaws and we will wait for hubby and fil to pick us back up to go over to bil and sil...I rest (fall asleep).&nbsp; We go over there.&nbsp; Eat pizza.&nbsp; Get going.&nbsp; The dog is annoying, barking at everyone which makes L cry...sil still ignoring her.&nbsp; On the way home, mil goes off about how she thinks L's problem is the breast milk because sil has not stopped to think about the way her eating habits affect L.&nbsp; True but I don't know if this is it.&nbsp; Regardless, it showed both hubby and I a little insight into where mil is coming from.  Anyway...I remember a friend I have, h, that also knows my sil, saying, I don't know if she will be able to handle a baby...it won't be all about her anymore.&nbsp; I had forgotten that comment until this weekend as I am watching her...I'm still trying not to pass judgement but she was not like any new mother I have ever seen...and I've seen a lot!&nbsp; Usually, when your newborn cries your top priority is to figure out what is wrong and try to get the baby to stop crying...she could not have cared less.&nbsp; And, as I was watching her this weekend, I thought, h was right...she can't handle her show being cancelled.&nbsp; Sad...  But, all in all, we had a great time which surprised us both.&nbsp; I had nightmares about babies both nights we were there...which was sad.&nbsp; It was a bittersweet feeling spending so much time with L.&nbsp; I loved holding her and watching her but it was tough because it brought my desire to have a baby right to the surface...  oh yeah...bil asked if they could come the WHOLE week with us to FL next year...umm, we offered two nights!&nbsp; Hubby said not a chance in hell...haha.

       S, in your Cinderella story, you'd get to Kiss the Prince       You don't need the pouffy dress, the fancy hair, or the 3-inch glass heels. A romantic soul like you just wants a guy who's a true companion, a good friend, a real prince. And if he's hot? All the better. But ultimately, you know that home is where the heart is. Which is probably why you surround yourself with good friends you can take care of and laugh with  friends who will do the same for you.But that doesn't keep you from fantasizing about the perfect relationship. It's not that you don't have your feet firmly planted on the ground. It's just that you're not afraid to shoot high. Or wish upon a shooting star. So keep reaching for your goals, Cinderella. If you do, your happily ever after can't be far away. And you can seal that with a kiss.

      damn!&nbsp; I hate when I do that!&nbsp; So, as I mentioned, Target was out of Ashlee Simpson's cd.&nbsp; So, I ran to Best Buy yesterday to get it.&nbsp; I was obsessing, so I figured I would treat myself.&nbsp; I don't remember the last "new" cd I bought.&nbsp; Usually, I buy them off of eBay...actually, I do remember, Alicia Keyes.&nbsp; So, it hasn't been terribly long, but still...so,&nbsp;I picked up the cd and was scoping out the others...I LOVE music and listen to it basically 24/7.&nbsp; So, I saw a Saliva cd...there is a song of theirs I LOVE so I looked at the back to see if I could figure out if this was the right one.&nbsp; Well, Best Buy has some other music blaring and I can't think of anything but what I'm hearing!&nbsp; So, I decide just to buy it...dumb, dumb, dumb.&nbsp; NO, it isn't the cd I want and I had to turn it off because it is too angry rock to play at work.&nbsp; Damn!&nbsp; Oh, well...one more cd I own that I don't listen to...so, I got on Amazon, researched what cd of Saliva's I want and ordered it...  oh, yeah, one of my manager's looks like he could be George's brother...no wonder I get all funny around him...haha

      I forgot...I couldn't get Ashlee Simpson's cd yesterday because Target was sold out.&nbsp; I'm a dork, I know...but I did pick up George Michael's Patience.&nbsp; Man!&nbsp; That man is so extremely hot!&nbsp; I love the song "Amazing" and have listened to it close to 100 times...which means, next week, I won't be able to stand it...but I don't know.&nbsp; Just picturing George gives me the chills.&nbsp; Yummy!

      lordy!&nbsp; This week is absolutely never-ending...yesterday, I was seriously terrified that if I blinked too long I would fall asleep at my desk.&nbsp; It isn't like I don't have tons of stuff to do...tons may be an exaggeration but I am still trying to sort through crap from being off...but that is the problem, trying to make heads or tails of someone else's work is just about impossible.&nbsp; I get annoyed because I'm looking at the same po for two days and can't figure out where to find the backup info.  Got my rings yesterday...yippee!!!&nbsp; I am in LOVE with my mystic topaz.&nbsp; It takes on a pretty green color when under fluorescent light and more of a purple color in natural...plus, its huge!&nbsp; Haha...I don't know why, but I love big rocks on my fingers!&nbsp; My blue topaz is beautiful as well but, as always, I don't wear much blue so I don't really know when I think I'm going to actually wear it!&nbsp; Though, I did get a cute tank top with blue flowers on it so I'm sure I'll wear it then.  Okay...so question...how long after a cyst bursts before you feel "normal"?&nbsp; Anyone know?&nbsp; I don't feel sick just nauseous occassionally...also lightheaded.&nbsp; I attribute it to the cyst but it may not be...barely any cramping left, so that is good...  hearing test a week from Monday...B's surgery a week from tomorrow...got my teeth cleaned this past Tuesday!&nbsp; Man, that felt awesome.&nbsp; I had not gone in an embarassingly long time...but the funny thing is she told me I had hardly any plaque build-up and my teeth looked great!&nbsp; Whew!&nbsp; I was so terrified that I had cavities.&nbsp; So, now, I am taking an interest in my teeth...I'm starting a whitening system.&nbsp; My teeth aren't bad but I want them to&nbsp;be white.&nbsp;   Talked to my sister yesterday...explained the blow-up with mommy-dearest.&nbsp; She re-iterated...it isn't that mom despises me, she just doesn't like it when people hand her the truth and disregard the version of truth she is trying to pass off, which is what I do.&nbsp; Actually saw her yesterday, we said hi but didn't talk.  Can you tell I'm bored out of my goard???&nbsp; Ugh.

      it's a boy!&nbsp; Woo-hoo!&nbsp; They are going to name him William and call him Liam.&nbsp; No middle name yet...  I forgot to mention a couple B'isms from last night:  1.&nbsp; Mom, know what is better than smelling my feet?&nbsp; No, B, what?&nbsp; Smelling my armpits!&nbsp; B, that is disgusting!&nbsp; No, it's not, it's cool!  2.&nbsp; Mom, can you come wipe my butt?&nbsp; (he is four and hasn't completely taken over this responsibility...gross, I know...but you do what you gotta do) Did you go poop?&nbsp; (I don't know why I ask this...habit) No...&nbsp; Then why do I have to wipe your butt?&nbsp; Because I tooted and it was funky so I want to make sure there is nothing on my butt.&nbsp; (and, yes, I did go up and wipe it)...  Okay, so speaking with our son like he is an adult does not always go our way...yes, I know he has a wide vocabulary but he also understands things that four year olds probably should not.&nbsp; And, on a particularly humorous day, delivers doozies like the above two.&nbsp; It is so hard not to wet myself as I am laughing!

      I think J&R are having a boy!&nbsp; Of course, we played phone tag all day yesterday, so I never heard it from her mouth but La said she "thinks" she heard it was a boy...La is young so this is not that exciting to her...but I'm really excited!&nbsp; Now, if I can just get her to tell me what the name is going to be!!!&nbsp;   We are going up to the inlaws this weekend.&nbsp; M&J had a rough weekend this past one so when I called to see if they were going to be around, I offered us up to watch L.&nbsp; M felt bad because she said they want to see us too, not just use us as babysitters...I told her it was up to them but not to feel bad and just let us know.&nbsp; Haha!&nbsp; I'm back as being the bigger person in all situations and I must say, it feels good!&nbsp; M and my mil are at each others throats...well, M is really pissed at her and no one can tell if my mil even&nbsp; knows.&nbsp; BUT it takes me out of the hotseat for a little while!&nbsp; So, we will head up there Friday and probably come back early Sunday.&nbsp; We will probably go out on the boat for a while and I'm not sure what else.

      It is SO hard to believe that a week ago we were on vacation...we were shopping in Nassau to be exact.&nbsp; So, here is a mini run-down of our vacation: &nbsp; Saturday: Drop B off at my parents, drive to Elmhurst for Portillo's (YUM!), stop at Kohl's so hubby can buy a watch (his broke Friday night), somehow found ourselves to the Park-n-Jet, fly from Chicago to Miami.&nbsp; Arrive around 8pm (I think) and wait for hotel shuttle to take us to the hotel.&nbsp; Get to the room, relax, go to hotel restaurant for dinner and saw the fireworks from the restaurant. &nbsp; Sunday: Wake up, go downstairs to find some info on what to do in Miami.&nbsp; Concierge hooks us up with a tour guide.&nbsp; Rush back upstairs to get breakfast and get ready.&nbsp; Meet Oscar for our 3 1/2 hour tour.&nbsp; Oscar, who is Cuban, takes us to Coral Gables, South Beach, and several other places...very nice guy...very cute accent...we got to see Julio Iglesias, Rosie O'Donnell, and Gloria Estefan's houses.&nbsp; Hubby bought cigars from a Cuban guy...very cool tour... &nbsp; Sunday night we are hooked up with a FREE limo ride down to South Beach to go to dinner at a fancy Italian restaurant.&nbsp; First time hubby or I remember riding in a limo...fun!&nbsp; After a nice dinner, we walk down to South Beach but it starts raining so we go back and take the limo back to the hotel. &nbsp; Monday:&nbsp; Cruise day!&nbsp; We get up, get breakfast, get ready and go meet the shuttle to take us to the cruise.&nbsp; Getting on the boat did not take as long as we anticipated.&nbsp; We scoped out the boat a bit and had lunch.&nbsp; We go to a mini-seminar about shopping in Nassau and get some free stuff (jewelry, mug, perfume)...go to the casino and get lessons on blackjack and some poker game but I don't remember which one.&nbsp; Have dinner...meet a VERY nice couple from Pennsylvania, not too impressed with the other couples (one couple can't stop complaining about their food).&nbsp; Later on we stop in the casino where I lose $10 in the matter of minutes and I walk away.&nbsp; Stopped to watch the blackjack table and see&nbsp;a guy lose $500 in less time than I lost the $10...all of a sudden, I don't feel so bad.&nbsp; Saw the show... &nbsp; Tuesday: Nassau!&nbsp; We get up and get out shopping.&nbsp; Promised hubby it would be 2hours, it was 3 1/2.&nbsp; Still not bad.&nbsp; Got a bunch of free stuff and some souvenir stuff.&nbsp; Afterwards, we go back to the boat for lunch and a quick rest.&nbsp; Then we head back out to catch a taxi to take us to Paradise Island.&nbsp; We go up to see the Atlantis and walk around for a couple hours...we aren't allowed to go outside to the cool places which suck but serves us right for being too cheap for the tour!&nbsp; We go to their casino where I won $13.25 in the first push of the button (nickle slots)...I feel redeemed from the night before.&nbsp; Take a water taxi back to Nassau and stop by Senor Frog's...two children ask us to pay them $1 for a song.&nbsp; Stop at the straw market...very hot...very pushy people.&nbsp; Go back to the boat.&nbsp; Attend an art auction, get free art.&nbsp; Formal night, we have a bottle of champagne and I feel drunk...haha!&nbsp; Go to the captain's welcome for more champagne...is gross but free!&nbsp; Listen to the band. &nbsp; Wednesday: CocoCay!&nbsp; Get up, have breakfast, take the boat over to the island.&nbsp; Walk around the island and go get snorkeling gear and lesson.&nbsp; Begin snorkeling.&nbsp; See the shipwreck and airplane crash.&nbsp; Lose my conch shell bracelet...find it...lose it again.&nbsp; Get bit by a fish.&nbsp; Go have lunch and go to Aqua park.&nbsp; Realize the park is really for young kids and teens...decide we are too old and fat to get on a giant inflated see-saw and giant inflated "rock" climb (couldn't get our fat butts up and out of the water!) Decide to stop wasting time and go back to snorkeling...go to the last lifeguard station and then head to the deep sea.&nbsp; On the way out, people are coming in saying there has been a shark siting but we see lots of people still out and figure it is a rumor.&nbsp; We see a lot of stingrays, beautiful colored fish, and, yes, a shark!&nbsp; Small one though...I had the camera so I had to try to swim closer to get a picture, don't know if it will turn out or not.&nbsp; After we come in, we are told it is very possible large sharks were in the deep sea section as it is MATING season and they come into more shallow water to mate...beautiful!&nbsp; Go back to boat...see a show.&nbsp; Play the "scavenger" hunt game. &nbsp; Thursday: Key West!&nbsp; We have to wait for everyone to be cleared by customs...get pissed at same idiots whose names are being called.&nbsp; Get cleared.&nbsp; Get breakfast, head out.&nbsp; Call B, he tells me that he is being made to work on his vacation and asks if I have ever heard of working on a vacation...very hostile.&nbsp; Ask if he is having a good time and he says no because he has to work on his vacation...duh, mom!&nbsp; We walk around aimlessly...find the aloe store to get aloe for our sunburn.&nbsp; Find LOTs of beautiful jewelry but nothing quite my price.&nbsp; Keep walking around.&nbsp; Stop for a piece of Key Lime pie.&nbsp; Eat lunch at Hogs Breath.&nbsp; Walk some more...and some more...find a blue topaz I break down and buy.&nbsp; Start heading back to the boat, pass a market to shop at.&nbsp; BOUGHT some shells and a stingray doll for B...stop in one more jewelry store before getting back on the boat...bought a gorgeous mystic topaz in white gold.&nbsp; I feel guilty but hubby assures me I just get it.&nbsp; (He has bought quite a few expensive things for himself by this point so I'm sure my getting the ring makes HIM feel less guilt).&nbsp; Go back to the boat and swim.&nbsp; Take a nap and go to dinner.&nbsp; Pack and fall asleep. &nbsp; Friday:&nbsp; Get up and ready immediately, we have to be off the boat quite early.&nbsp; Get to the hotel around 9 or 10am.&nbsp; I order breakfast and we both take a nap.&nbsp; Get up, watch tv, watch Jersey Girl, take a nap.&nbsp; Get up, go down to gift shop for pop, take another nap and watch tv.&nbsp; Get up, go to hotel restaurant for dinner, go back and lay down.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Saturday:&nbsp; Get up EARLY to take shuttle to airport.&nbsp; Plane loaded and then find out valve is broken...delayed 45 minutes.&nbsp; Get to Chicago, get luggage, meet shuttle to go get car...head back to Michigan...stop at parents to give souvenirs and get Brennan...GO HOME!!! &nbsp; Okay...so this is the short version and there are so many memories in my head.&nbsp; If I figure out the picture stuff I will post some once they are returned.&nbsp; It was definitely the best vacation I have ever been on...even more special because hubby and I were ALONE for a whole WEEEK!&nbsp; We were nervous about it but it was just like old times, bumming around with my best friend.&nbsp; Made this week more lonely, but that is okay...it gives me something to look forward to when I have more time with him someday!  As for salmon...yes, it was my first time!&nbsp; There isn't a good seafood/fish place in Kzoo...and when I lived in Chicago, I would always get shrimp at those places...I like the salmon when it was warm, when it was cold they had it too salty...

      oh lordy!&nbsp; My day went so badly yesterday...so the cyst burst and it was bad, bad pain...we went out grocery shopping, which I barely made it through and then I came home and slept...and slept...and slept some more.&nbsp; Well, we had invited the parents over for Key Lime Pie as an additional "thank you" for watching B for the week...so, they arrive.&nbsp; My mom asks how I was as I wasn't looking to keen...I briefly explain what happened and we move on with conversation. &nbsp; Fast forward an hour...maybe two.&nbsp; Dessert has been eaten.&nbsp; Hubby, B, and my dad go out to play baseball.&nbsp; My mom decides this is the time to start planning my older sis' baby shower.&nbsp;  &nbsp; Background info: she had already sent out invites WITHOUT consulting with either La or I...SHE created the guest list, again, without input...and invites HER friends whom my sister has met once or twice...READ: this is really a party for HER, a social event for her to pull off.&nbsp; Now, mind you, I have lived with her ways for many years and KNEW this is what is was going to become... &nbsp; Back to last night...so, she had previously asked what I thought of having this restaurant cater.&nbsp; Stuipidly, I said I didn't think it was a good idea because it would cost too much.&nbsp; So, as "we" are planning this, the first thing she writes is Restaurant X for sandwiches.&nbsp; ummm...okay.&nbsp; Then she asks, what would go with the sandwiches...to which I say, fruit and vegetables.&nbsp; What should we drink? Tea and lemonade.&nbsp; Should we have a cake? yes...and on with the questions...which I answered.&nbsp; All of a sudden, she puts the pen down and says to La and I, I don't appreciate your lack of enthusiasm.&nbsp; WHAT?!&nbsp; (yes, that is what I actually responded with)...I just don't think you are very excited about this and willing to help.&nbsp; To which I said, I guess I'm confused, you were asking questions, I was answering...besides, this is your party and I am assuming you are going to tell me what you want me to do.&nbsp; (Not exact words but meaning)...well, it went downhill from there.&nbsp; So, basically, there was my mom and I yelling at each other...me trying to remind her the ordeal I had just gone through....I have been trying all night and all morning to understand where she is coming from and I just can't...she stomped out of the house and told my dad to take her home... &nbsp; once again, I'm the black sheep of the family...it is usually more fun than last night.

      Email I sent from the cruise on Wednesday, July 14th: &nbsp;  Good morning!&nbsp; We are about to arrive in CocoCay this morning.&nbsp; We will be going snorkeling and to an "Aqua Park" which, basically, sounds like a water amusement park--we are thinking along the lines of Michigan Adventure???&nbsp; Of course, last night, I had a nightmare about being bitten by a shark and being stuck on coral so we will see how long I last!&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We have been having a wonderful time.&nbsp; We got to relax in Miami and took a tour around the city.&nbsp; Our guide was Cuban and very friendly and very knowledgeable.&nbsp; It was neat to walk around with him as he showed us all kinds of places that aren't necessarily tourist attractions.&nbsp; One of his friends gave us some Cuban coffee.&nbsp; I actually liked it!&nbsp; It was VERY strong and made your tongue tingle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hubby was not a big fan.&nbsp; Later that night, a limo picked us up at the hotel to go down to South Beach for dinner.&nbsp; We ate a lovely Italian restaurant and then walked down to South Beach.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The first few hours of the cruise we were a little nervous about being bored but it is NOT even possible!&nbsp; There are a million things going on the boat and we are somewhere different everyday.&nbsp; Yesterday, we were at Nassau and took a taxi over to Paradise Island.&nbsp; I dragged&nbsp;hubby to a special seminar on the boat about the shopping in Nassau...you can imagine how thrilled he was!&nbsp; But we got some "insider tips" and had a successful (though I'm sure&nbsp;hubby would say painful) shopping trip.&nbsp; You will have to ask him about the "Straw Market" sometime...Paradise Island was beautiful and we went up to the Atlantis Resort...amazing.&nbsp; Being the seasoned gambler, I sat down at the nickle slots and won the first push!&nbsp; I was so excited!&nbsp; It was the best $13.25 I have ever had!!!&nbsp; And then, the frugal side of me came out and we walked away...lol!!!  &nbsp;  Last night was our formal night.&nbsp; It was very nice.&nbsp; I tried salmon for the first time!&nbsp; I tried to get&nbsp;hubby to taste escargout with me, but we chickened out&nbsp; After dinner, the captain's reception took place.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Well, we are off...we miss you!Love~S (&amp; S)&nbsp;   Well...we are back.&nbsp; We got back into Miami on Friday.&nbsp; I wasn't expecting us to get off the ship so early but we were off and back at the hotel by 10am.&nbsp; We basically napped and watched tv ALL day...I could have used another day of that!&nbsp; Saturday we flew back into Chicago and then drove&nbsp;the rest of the way&nbsp;home.&nbsp; It was so wonderful to see B again.&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only one time, while we were watching Jersey Girl in the hotel Friday, that it hit me hard how much I missed him.&nbsp; Other than that, I did a&nbsp;good job of compartmentalizing.  We had an amazing time and I will blog more when I have the energy...I am SO thankful, period never showed up!&nbsp; I was so concerned it would happen the second we&nbsp;left.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this morning I woke up in hideous pain.&nbsp; What I thought was my period but am now beginning to believe was&nbsp;a cyst bursting.&nbsp; My dr's told me it would feel like a period but, potentially, with no blood.&nbsp; Well, it was the MOST hideous cramping I have&nbsp;had.&nbsp; I was so nauseous and it hurt to even go to the bathroom! Trust me when I tell you, I have had&nbsp;painful, wrenching cramps...I used to be knocked out for a couple days...but this, this was terrible!&nbsp; I couldn't cry because it hurt too much.&nbsp; I seriously thought I was going to pass out...hubby wanted to take me to the emergency room but I just wanted to be crawled up with the heating&nbsp;pad.&nbsp; Lo and behold, this afternoon, I am fine.&nbsp; I am exhausted from this morning and still nauseous but not in hideous&nbsp;pain so I'm convinced I'm healed...and oh so grateful it happened today and not a day earlier!  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;

      Have I ever mentioned, you always get fucked at the drive through...those were words of wisdom I learned when working with AOC in Chicago...whoever went for lunch got screwed...either out of money or out of food.  But, somehow, I was always the one to go get the food...  Once again, I find myself in this type of situation but there is not much I can do about it.  See, although I work for the largest pharmaceutical company in the US, I am not technically their "employee"...I work through a company...for FOUR years I have done this, originally I was given the title "contract worker" now I have been demoted to "temporary worker"...when I went to get my badge renewed the security guy says, you are the longest working temp I know!  Attempting a joke, I'm sure, as many people here are in the same boat...and yet, I digress.  So, 5 weeks ago, my records indicate I am eligible for my shitty one week paid vacation.  I put it on my timesheet, expect to get paid the following week.  Not so, senora.  Rather than my company call me and let me know what is going on, they wait until I see the correct amount was not dd and I call them...have I mentioned they are a bunch of lazy losers?  So, it was then that Ms. Rodriguez tells me that their "NEW" policy says I have to have 1800 hours (instead of 1500)and those hours had to be accumulated AFTER the last vacation pay.  Well, well...the slimey bastards have come up with yet another way to screw me out of money.  Now, I can ONLY earn one week a year AND you just ripped away 200+ hours from last year when this policy WAS NOT in place.    Fast forward to last week.  Once again, I have satisfied all NEW policies communicated to me, so I send in vacation request.  Call Ms R to verify this is true, she confirms.  Call again to bring attention to the vacation request.  Talk to her on TUESDAY and she confirms they are going to pay me.  Last night, hubby comes home and tells me when he called the bank only one week of pay had been deposited.  My temper immediately flairs and now I can't sleep.  I arrive at work and, lo and behold, Ms R has left a message on my voice mail for me to call her at 8am.  I call at 8:02am...Mr R answers.  She tells me she is calling about my vacation pay...to which I say, yes, I figured as I know it was not deposited yesterday.  Ms R: Please let me finish what I have to say before responding.  Well, these rocket scientists did not understand their own frickin' policy.  SUPPOSEDLY, my vacation cannot be paid out until September (after my anniversary date)...BUT since it was their error, they will be paying out next week.  Very lucky...she tacks on, but next year we won't be able to pay out until after your anniversary date.  To which I say, I pray to god I won't be working for any of you next year.  For some reason, she seems shocked I said that...  While I have the brain-child on the phone I say, so what's going on with my raise (thinking to self, you know, the one you all have screwed me out of for two years)...Ms R: I haven't heard, I will call today.  Great let me know.  Side note:  I requested this raise the same day I talked to her about being screwed out of my vacation time...something in effect was said, you haven't given me a raise for two years and now you are trying to steal my vacation too?!  Why haven't you received a raise?  Because YOU told me not to request one two years ago.  Oh, well that hold was taken off a year ago...  Then WHY did you not tell me or why didn't YOU initiate the raises I missed.  I decided to call someone here to see if they have even gotten the paperwork as my manager has been telling me he has yet to see anything.  She tells me she wouldn't necessarily see it but it would go through Manpower and to call them...yes, I forgot to mention, I have recently been SUBCONTRACTED...so I call her, she tells me she received the request a week ago (What was the hold-up with PeopleLink that it took a month to get to them???) and that she cannot request until I have been approved to work the month of August...oh yeah, I am also now on a month to month...so that would be the end of July at the earliest!!!  I was SOOOOO irate by this point...I basically told her I would be hitting my knees more often and praying a lot harder that I would get out of this insane triangle.  Yeah, she didn't like that too much either.  Then I called the area manager of my company.  She was not in so I asked for the name of the branch manager of the home office.  I called and talked to her.  She was well aware of the whole vacation screw-up and apologized for that...I proceeded to tell her the cluster about my raise.  She was surprised and had not heard anything about it and promised to contact Manpower and try to get the paperwork moved.  The ironic part?  I don't even KNOW what they are asking...so I could be getting my panties in a bunch about .25!    the test was negative...not much emotion there...

      well, I have the test.  I don't know if I will do it tonight or try to hold out until Friday...although, I am pretty busy tonight so maybe that will hold my attention.  "Working Mother" magazine has an article this month about 2nd time around infertility.  I didn't realize until I read the article how common this problem has become.  It really was a well written article, unlike others I have read about PCOS.  It talked about how heartbreaking it is and it said something to the effect, these women know exactly what they are missing out on, unlike women who don't have any children.  Well, yes, exactly.  Not that infertility is any less of a heartache because they don't know exactly what they are missing but women who don't have any will look at someone like me and say, you should be happy you have at least one.  True, and I am very grateful.  However, you don't have a small child begging for a brother or sister either.  Of all the cruel, insane comments I have had to deal with, B's hit me right in the heart.  I can't explain to a four year old why when I don't know why.  I tell him this is how God wanted our family.  To which he responds, then I will pray for him to give me a sister/brother.  Anyway, I just greatly appreciated the article and wrote the editor to tell her so.  On a funny note, we went to Perkins (yuck!) for breakfast with my parents and younger sister.  This family walked in and was about ten people.  B's eyes got big and said, their family goes on forever!  It was cute...  Countdown: 3 more days until departure.  Still have to clean the house.  Shop.  Pack.  Leave sister information.

      hmmm...still no period.  I could have SWORN I would start this weekend...I had such hideous pain in the netherregion.  I should get a hpt but then, I hate the idea of spending the money when I know I'm not.  I have decided to wait until Friday.  I have to know for the cruise since I am sure I will consume a few adult beverages.  We went suit shopping for hubby...his last suit was bought for his college graduation and was a bit snug.  hey, at least he could get the pants on and fastened...I couldn't even get my left leg in my college clothes!  Anyway, we went to JCPenney.  He went to the salesman and said, I need your cheapest suit.  Dude said, $200 is the cheapest.  Neither of us was thrilled...my main beef?  I see suits right next to you that say $169.99.  So, basically, I was onto the fact he was only about the sale.  So, finally, after looking around and being bothered by him, I said, let's go...I'll figure something else out.  As we are walking out, my eagle eye caught a clearance rack.  So, yeah, we found a suit and paid $65 after final markdowns...unbelievable!  Of course, hubby was just laughing.  He says, that guy should have KNOWN better than to mess with you and your nose for a sale...haha!  It wouldn't have been either of our first choices but it is for one night and it will look great...plus, he now has a suit that fits properly...  Other than that...trying to build up energy so I can clean the house before we leave.  Who likes to come home to a messy house?    btw...check out the helpmebubby blog...very cool

      hey, fellow blogging friends!  This guy wants to know why we blog:  urlLink http://ydoublog.blogspot.com/2004/08/why-do-people-blog.html  so go forth and answer his question:)  I am in a giddy type mood...I think it is the sugar from the Gatorade I have been sipping on all day.  I decided since I can't find an awesome gift for my sis, she is stuck with maternity clothes.  Lame-o, I know.  We talked today...she is stressing out because of her size.  I told her, please, do NOT obsess!  Every woman is so different...every pregnancy is so different.  She is so concerned because she knows I didn't start showing until 6months...umm, yeah, but remember me at the end???  Plus, she is significantly shorter than I am, that makes a big difference too!!!  Not much else.  I decided I will be knitting her a baby blanket for the shower in October.  I found a pattern that is pretty cute and looks easy...we'll see.  I haven't picked up the needles for quite some time!  I went to a yarn store yesterday and was asking an opinion of one of the ladies that works there...big mistake.  This store has always had a stuck-up attitude...I have knit for so long and I will grace you with my knowledge but there is no other way than mine.  So, basically, she told me idea was stupid and she didn't know (and I quote) "what is in young mother's heads these days..."  Wow...let me put back the $40+ worth of yarn I have and relieve you from having such an ignoramous in your blessed presence.  So, I will go to the other yarn store that I really do like much better...I just was in the neighborhood of the other.  I will laugh if the lady ends up right...haha!  That would teach me!   Basically, I just want to add a "fancy" yarn in with the plain yarn on the smaller sections...oh, it is too difficult to explain...if there are knitters out there, let me know, and I will attempt to explain.  Her contention was that the baby would chew on the fancy yarn...okay, one of the yarns I picked out was like the whisper yarn, the kind with the longer "hair" strands...but the other was eros or something like that...it just has color blocks in it, nothing would actually stick out.  Anyway, my mom, who does not knit, says she thinks I should do it.  She said everyone always loves the "creations" I do so why should this be any different?  I'll see what yarn I find today.

      okay...this weekend, hubby and I watched "Bowling for Columbine."  If you haven't seen it, watch it.  It doesn't matter if you are democrat, republican, or otherwise.  It was extremely interesting and shed light on many things...whether you believe them or not.  It raised very pointed questions and didn't necessarily provide answers.  Thought provoking.  Very glad I watched it, a little scary since these nuts showcased had some tie to Michigan, but very good.  Now, I don't know if I have mentioned, but I have never voted.  Wait, I did vote, the first time I would have been eligible.  Not memorable as I didn't know who I was voting for, I voted Republican since that was who my parents voted for.  Scary, I know.  Anyway, this year, I really feel I need to vote.  The problem?  I don't know who to vote for.  I pretty much steer clear of politics.  Why you ask?  Because, I feel, all politicians lie.  They say what we want to hear and then do whatever they want once voted in.  I think Clinton did a lot to disenchant me...regardless, I think the US has some pretty serious issues...and the first place to fix them would be with our leaders.  So, basically, since spring, I have tried to find more information.  Do I want to vote to re-elect Bush?  Do I want to vote to kick him out?  See, I don't see it as voting to put Kerry in.  As I mentioned, I think they all lie, so why would I WANT Kerry.  Right now, he is lying...I can't tell you if he is good until he has served 4 years.  So, right now, I need to decide if I think Bush did a good job...please, feel free to comment away.  I'm very open minded.   People never believe that when someone says that.  Don't get me wrong...on actual ISSUES, I have mucho opinions.  On actual people...not so much.  At the same time, I can't broaden my horizons without being challenged.  I realize that my opinion today may not be the same as it is tomorrow.  IE, I used to think I should vote based on my moral beliefs (abortion).  Then I realized, this is so not a current issue for our government.  By voting for someone who is against abortion, I may be voting for someone who is ripping education and food out of inner-city children's reach...and which is more important???  I don't see Roe vs. Wade being overturned anytime soon, so I need to be more concerned with the children that are here and who is watching over them...  See?  I told you...I have many opinions but enjoy hearing others.  Diversity is to be embraced... sharing ideas is the only way to come up with one that might actually work...

      So, Friday was B's surgery.  We had to check in at 6:30am!  We could tell B was a little nervous but he held up like a trooper.  The pre-op nurse was so cute...Ruth.  She had B help her with the machine to take his blood pressure and pulse readings.  She had an adorable accent and I don't think B could understand what she was saying most of the time.  They gave him a medication that reminded me of Staydol...I don't know what it was but it took his apprehensions away.  It was funny because he was trying to tell us stories and would forget what he was saying.  The anesthesiologist came in and explained what he would be doing.  He told us B would experience discomfort/pain from the tube put down his throat.  The dr came in and we again asked what type of pain B would have...oh, there is no pain associated!  I asked her how she was going to remove the adenoids (through the mouth) because B had wanted to know.  They came and took him.  Hubby and I were only in the waiting room 30-40 minutes before the dr came back out and said she was done.  B's adenoids were significantly larger than in the CAT scan from March so the dr is convinced this was the problem and the removal will solve his issues.  Again, we asked what pain we could expect...oh, none!  The nurse came to get us a few minutes later and showed us to the recovery room.  B was sitting in a chair whimpering.  I asked the nurse what was wrong (naively believing he would not be in pain).  She explained boys' testosterone and the anesthesia don't mix and they wake up upset.  Hubby picked B up so I could put him on my lap and rock.  The moment he realized we were there he started shrieking...and shrieking...and sobbing...and shrieking.  It was awful.  I was not prepared for that (did anyone mention this would happen after asking a million times???)!  Meanwhile, the nurses are telling me I have to watch the IV flow...the faster he gets the fluid in him, the faster we go home.  Finally, after what seemed like a lifetime, they came in to give him a sedative in his IV.  Well, the first one did nothing.  So a few minutes later, they were back with another one.  He stopped shrieking and just cried.  He said his throat hurt really bad.  So, we started giving him water.  He downed it like he was parched and ate a popsicle.  A nurse came in and warned us, the more water you give him, the more likely he is to vomit before you get home.  I guess the anesthesia throws off the equilibrium and having so much water in the stomach adds to it.  So what do we do?  She advised us if it keeps him calm, just give it to him.  I thanked her for the advance warning...I would MUCH rather know what I potentially face and prepare for it than be caught off guard (ie, not being forewarned how he would potentially be when he woke up!!!).  Thankfully, no vomiting...we got home, put him on the sofa bed and turned on cartoons.  Seriously, within an hour he was up and moving around.  By the end of the morning, he was bouncing off the walls and you would never know the child had surgery.  Great, excellent, blessing...yes.  BUT hubby and I had been told he was going to be groggy and tired so he would probably sleep all day.  So WE were expecting to be able to sleep all day...man!  I am so thankful he came through okay...of course, the night before, I had hideous nightmares and got virtually no sleep.  And, yes, I really am grateful that he is back to my rambunctious B.  B and I went to Kohl's on Sunday...they had a Superman tshirt on sale that hubby has been looking for to match his tattoo...who do we see?  Mr X's mom and stepdad...lordy.  I got my hair chopped off on Saturday morning and have yet to figure out how to style it so I am praying they did not see me!  Does anyone know of any awesome hair straightening products?  My haircut has reminded me why I don't do short...my hair is naturally funky wave and without the weight of long hair it goes crazy...ugh.  For example, I straightened and flipped this morning.  It is already wavy again!!!  I know my hair will take a while to re-train to flip but the wave is nasty...any advice is appreciated!
