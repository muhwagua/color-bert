      I fucking  hate  HTML.... so this page you're looking at looks quite nice, but that's because it's using a set template provided by the good folks at  blogger.com , but how the  fuck   do I make the other pages which I intend to put up here look similar?  Any suggestions? Never mind, I appear to have  figured  it  urlLink out   Anyhoo, I had to miss my composition lesson today - I woke up at 2pm with a bastard of a migraine.. my lesson is at 3pm, so I had an hour to make up several pages of .PDF files, MIDI recordings, burn a CD with it all on there, take a shower, ride to uni, print the afore-mentioned .PDF files on the uni computers (and hope that the printer doesn't go haywire again) and have breakfast. Seeing as it takes 20 minutes to get to uni without riding extremely dangerously, I could see taht it asn't going to happen. Especially not with a motherfucking migraine.

      So... I had my Compose & Play thingo today  It worked quite well I think - five instruments and six or seven mobile phones all playing together. Sounded quite strange... I hope it came out well on the recording =)   Only a week untill the ASO play the Finale to my Symphony! =D I wandered in there today to hand in the missing 2nd Trumpet part, and the lady at the reception desk had  absolutely no fucking idea  what the hell I was on about with this "student composition run-through" buisness... I don't even think she understood the idea of a composer...  =D

      So anyway... I'm Unfunk (aka Lindsay)... I'm a composer from Adelaide, Australia, and I like to write music.  Funny about that really..  Playing videogames is also good wholesome fun. Especially Sega games. Apparently. so are women.. but the ones I go for tend to be rather painful. Which sucks. But you get that.  And now, time to magically write a piece for tommorow's class, a 3,000-word History essay, and figure out just what the fuck happened to the first page of the 2nd Trumpet part for the ASO thang...

      Well, the Adelaide Symphony Orchestra has played my music, and there will be an MP3 uploaded before long - just as soon as I can get my hands on the CD  I was only given 30 minutes, in which Valentine was played through twice, and only  one  little bit of fiddling, which didn't solve much at all, so I'm afraid that the recording, when it appears, won't be of a terribly high performance quality.  Oh well, such is life - I'll do some work on it and submit the whole work to the Toru Takemitsu Competition in a week or so... hopefully it'll get somewhere.   In other news...  Why is  urlLink my good name  being tainted?

      OK... I'm now uploading the MP3 of my Compose & Play piece from Thursday  It better not be fucking raining tomorrow morning - I have to pedal to uni with a huge-arsed DAT machine case on my back, which leaves me  no  room for any books or anything... Bloody Richard (the tech. guy) was  35 minutes late  today - this meant that I had to ride home in peak hour - I was waiting at one intersection for ten minutes before a suitable gap appeared in the traffic... just to get to the middle of the road!  Razor burn sucks

      OK, so there's this girl... I'm not going to name her, even though there's fuck-all chance that she's ever going to read this page, but I'm pretty sure she likes me. But then, I've been  pretty sure  before, and been dead wrong... so how the fuck do you tell? Should I go up to her and ask her if she wants to go grab a coffee? If so,  then  what? We seemed to hit it off pretty well in Darwin, but since then we've had fuck-all time together alone, and I really don't perform well under observation. But she went a bit cold on me at the end of the week up there, so I don't know what the fuck is going on... I wish there was some sort of magic  thingo  that I could use to tell her I really like her... but alas, it's not to be =(

      hrm... I'm in the music computer lab, and only one person appears to be using anything even remotely related to music.  I'm about to pick up the DAT machine from the tech. guy - apparently, we have  five  DAT machines, but only  two  are working. Both of these were booked out all weekend, and one of them was apparently being used by teh tech guy himself. That's just not on, folks - this equipment should be primarily for  student  use only, not for his own shenanegains  >=(

      Woah - did you just get that nasty popup? That's fucked - I might like porn and all, but I draw the line at it popping up in my face when I don't want it to. Which is most of the time. While I'm on about it, who the  fuck  honestly believes that they can make their penis '3-4 inches bigger' just by taking pills? How do the people behind this product intend to make money? Most people with half a brain realise that a pill can't physically change you - other than maybe giving you an ulcer or possibly killing you...  Some Oasis guy is on The Panel at the moment... fuck, I hate that voice

      I woke up at about 6am today, and as per any normal day, I have a nice lump of plegm in the back of my throat. So I stumble out to the bathroom where I do the usual processes to remove said lump of phlegm, and when I spat it out, it was black!  Black, I tell ya!  Then, while I was in the shower about an hour or so ago, blood started pouring out of my nose, and I had to cough up another wonderful black gob... tasty  The obvious reason for all of this is that I must have had a blood nose in my sleep or something, which all clotted at the back of my throat, as I sleep on my back - my nose started 'bleeding' in the shower because the steam loosened up the dried blood in there..  Just felt like sharing this all with yas =P  Now why the  fuck  won't Grand Theft Auto 3 either save my game properly or load my saved games without crashing?  See the previous post for my thoughts on this issue =D

      My good friend  urlLink Neal  has just updated his page with a glowing report of  urlLink Scorpion Technologies , so I figured that I should too.  So far I've purchased a motherboard and a soundcard for myself, and a whole system upgrade for a friend from them, and they've been totally ace on every occasion. Two thumbs up.  Try  urlLink this thing  out - I rank somewhere near Ghandi and Nelson Mandela.. and opposite to our  urlLink Nation's Leader . Good work. =D  As far as composition goes, I seem to be getting back on track - I'm writing a piece entitle  Ticks and Leeches  for 2 Flutes, Voice, String Quartet and Pianoforte. It's very,  very  loosley based on the Tool song of the same name, and so may undergo a name change before it gets finished.  Is it enough though? I'm staring down the barrel of failing composition this year thanks to this total lack of motivation and/or inspiration, and I have the ominous feeling that I'm not going to be able to get things done in time.  And again with the ladies... I have this horrible, horrible feeling that as long as a certain young lady is in my life then no other woman will be good enough.  Blinded by love? Jaded, more likely. I'm 23 and I haven't had a single serious relationship in my life. Every time an opportunity presents itself, something happens to snatch it all away. Maybe I'm going for the wrong sorts of women? Fuck knows, I've gone for a whole variety of them in my life and never gotten anywhere.  Oh well, I'll live.. I assume.

         Having ordered this CD nearly  two years ago  and subsequently forgetting about it after the shop didn't contact me, I found it in my local Muses the other week and purchaced it.  From the back of the CD:   The greatest road to advancement is through pain. Physically and emotionally, Tool demonstrate this through music that is more than just typical head-banging power chords.  The String Tribute to Tool: Third Eye Open  delivers the band's solemn and sinister message through string instruments that can be warm and welcoming at one moment, cold and distant at the another. Materly performed by some of today's hottest string players, this album offers a totally new interpretation of the musical mastermind that is Tool.   The premise for this album is to take Tool songs and arrange them (more or less faithfully) for a string ensemble, thus presenting the familiar songs in a new light. The ten tracks on this CD are: 1) Sober   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   2) Intolerance   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   3) The Grudge   (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   4) The Patient  (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   5) Opiate   (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   6) Hush   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   7) Schism   (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   8) Ticks and Leeches   (Electric Violin, 2 Violins, Viola, Cello)   9) Aenema   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   10) Pushit   (Violin, Viola, Cello, Contrabass)   Overall, the songs are well arranged, but the thing that really,  really  bugs me is that two people arranged half the songs each. One of whom is a much,  much  better arranger than the other, so some of the songs (1, 2, 6, 9, 10) sound utterly fantastic, while the others are just "good." I don't know why they chose to do this; probably to reduce their workload, I assume.. but it just sticks out like a sore thumb to me. I don't know if it will to anybody without much musical training though, but them's the breaks. I was disappointed that favorite songs like Ticks and Leeches and The Patient were let down by a sub-par arrangement, but I was very glad that Pushit and Sober weren't :)  I give it an 8/10 - worth a listen, even if you're not into Tool (HEATHEN!) or Classical music (ditto) :D   urlLink Sober

      To anybody using the unfunk.cjb.net URL and Internet Explorer to get to this page: * sorry about that stupid fucking Gator popup - don't click "yes" - it's evil, evil, evil.  Evil.  * Untill I can afford to buy a .com domain name, use  urlLink this  URL to get to my site. I know, it's not as easy to remember, but it's not as if people ever come here anyway, right?  * Internet Explorer sucks. However, it's light-years better than Netscape 4.07 which Adelaide University insists on you using for some reason. * Go download  urlLink Opera  if you can - it's much bettar than IE or Netscape, but you sacrifice a few non-standard things, such as that retarded Gator popup and other ActiveX plugins, but you get transparent and alphablended .PNG's!  Right, so I've signed myself up for a three-month contract with  urlLink Lithoptix  for DSL... but I'm hearing bad things over at the  urlLink Whirlpool Forums , so I'm more than a bit worried.  =(

      I dunno if this  urlLink Caffinated Soap  actually gives you a caffiene hit or not, but if it doesn't, then the wonderful peppermint scent gives you a nice kick.  Just don't wash your face with it, as it really dries out your skin. I look like I haven't washed my face in days because of that.  Recommended.  Now where the fuck is my t-shirt hat?

      Not really something I should be advertising to the whole wide world, but I have come into posession of the leaked (read: stolen) Half Life 2 beta and sourcecode.  It's good.  It's very good. It's most definately going to be a game worth purchasing.   However.  It just doesn't feel all that  new  to me. Sure, it's a beta version, and definately isn't what will be released to the world on.. whatever the release date is now, but to me it feels like they've just taken the existing  urlLink Quake  engine (probably Quake III), reverse-engineered it the way Compaq did to the IBM BIOS way back when and added stuff like specular highlighting, better physics, better lighting, awesome water effects and fan-fucking-tasting models. Sure, I'm going out on a limb by saying that, and I'm not a programmer, so the sourcecode means absolutely nothing to me, so I can't find out if that's true or not, but this game behaves exactly as if it were a Quake-based game. Right down to the way the Torch works  exactly  the same way as it did in the orginal Half-Life, which was based on the Quake II engine, I believe.  I'm definately going to get it when it comes out, but I think a few people will be rather disappointed that it's not the technology leap that they are expecting.  If I can figure out how to take a screenshot, I'll post one ot two =)

      Oh yes. This much junk mail is ridiculous:     In other news,  urlLink Halo  for PC is out. It's awesome. Even if you've played the XBox version to death, you should get the PC version just for interweb multiplayer.  If you got a GeForce FX5200 like I do (or lower) though, you might want to run it with the -use11 switch to get it at a playable speed with most of the details.

       Roses only last like a couple weeks, and that's if you leave them in water. They really only exist to be pretty. So sending your lover a rose is like saying "my love for you is transitory and based solely on your appearance" - but a potato! Potatos last for fucking ever, man. In fact, not only will they not rot, they actually grow shit even if you just leave them in the sack! That part alone makes it a good symbol.  But there's more!  There are so many ways to enjoy a potato! you can even make a battery with it! That's like saying "I have many ways in which I show my love for you" Potatos may be ugly, but they're still awesome, so that's like saying "it doesn't matter at all what you look like, I'll still love you"

        urlLink Coma    Music ©2003 Lindsay Stevens Lyrics ©1999 Lindsay Stevens   Holy, lost and lifeless, Thinking all that hurts. Judging by this darkness, Seems I've been before. 	 Heard my name was crawling, Don't know what you mean. Call your name and you'll see, You'll see what I mean.  Falling through this blackness, Waking sometime soon. I can see you crying, I can feel the blame.  Heard my name was crawling, Don't know what you mean. Call your name and you'll see, You'll see what I mean.  Deathly lost and lifeless, Holding all that hurts. I see you crying, I'm not to blame!  Heard my name was crawling, I know what you mean. Call your name, yeah, you see, You know what I mean.

      Fucking hell, it's been hellishly hot =(  Anyway, I've knocked together a quick and dirty music  urlLink index page  with two new pieces. Drowning in Mercury is a complete product, at least.. untill I can figure out what else I can do to it  FYE is an incomplete recording of a song I wrote back in High School... now that I have the equipment, I can record and play around with it. I must say, it's very different to how I originally intended it to be - the big heavy metal solos have disappeared, and there's an element of Jazz/Blues that's appearing there. Considering that I don't like Jazz or Blues that much, it's rather weird.  It's about halfway finished so far, and the MP3 conversion lessened the quality somewhat, unfortunately

      Wow, what a holiday season this has been!  Where do I start telling about it?  My dear sister Beatrice came back from teaching English in Japan on the 23rd of December, and about an hour after she came into the house, our brother Roly, whom we'd only met like twice or so, rang us. Normally this bloke resides in Tasmania, but apparently he was in Adelaide for some Ford dealer conference or something. Anyway, evidently he was on his mobile, as the signal dropped out. About ten minutes later, the phone rang - we all knew it was him - and Beatrice answered the phone with a hearty " KONNICHIWASTRANGEJAPANESEPHRASEYWAA!! " and the voice on the other side (apparently) said:  "G'day, this is your big brother... ... .... .....Denis"  Farken  Within an hour, we (myself, Beatrice and Angus, my flatmate and Beatrice's ex) were all travelling up to Blakeview to a barbeque with Roly and Denis. When we get there, we're introduced to Jon....  another  brother... and to Sharon (go, I hope that's the right name!), his wife.... and their two kids.  Faaarken  So anyway, we had a pre-christmas barbeque lunch and left at about 6pm or thereabouts.  [insert two days here]  Boxing Day comes along, and Roly & Denis take myself and Beatrice out to lunch, which consisted of a large meal at the Eros Cafe on Rundle Street, followed by (lots of) drinks at the Austral hotel up the street, followed by a trip to Kirsty's place for a singalong and a catching up with Alex and Angus before heading off to the pub around the corner (Earl of Leicester) for more drinks, another large meal, followed by more drinks. All in all, the lunch lasted for twelve hours.  Faaaaaaarken.  Now, just to clarify things, this is how my family is made up:     Now then - from my limited understanding of the situation, Roly was given up for adoption for whatever reason - I think Fred (Sigfried) lost his job shortly after he was born. Jon and Denis were taken away from mum & Fred by Family Services after mum had a mental breakdown or something, and placed in foster care.  When mum & Fred got divorced, apparently she went and had a fling with some Dutch guy and Jessica (my sister, not my previous love intrest, ffs!) was the result. He fucked off to Canada for some chick, and mum then met Charles (aka "Tony") who then decided to call Jessica Beatrice. That is to call her by her middle name rather than her first, because he didn't like the name Jessica (sacrelige!). Shortly after that, I popped out.  Between us, we span some 16 or so years - Roly turns 40 this year, Beatrice turns 30, and I turn 24.  farken, ffs.  I got a family for christmas, what did  you  get? =P

      apparently I'm now 24.  suffice to say that I'm not terribly happy about this turn in events - if I had my way, I'd still be 17 with a head full of hair and high hopes. I still haven't done  half  the things I'd wanted to do by the time I was 21; have my own band, have a relationship (stable or otherwise), have a decent income, have gotten  somewhere  in my life...  OK, let's look at this objectively, shall we?  I'm (theoretically) in my final year of my degree - which I never thought I'd do. I have lots of wonderful friends; Neal, Kirra, Paris, Michael, Jessica, Angela, Trista, Kimberly, Angus, Haylee, Angus, Kirsty, Alex, Dave, Brooksie, Kat, Kat, Bronwen, Allan, Sean... I'm looking at youse guys. Thanks for being there, you've been great.  I'm a composer, which I guess is the next-best-thing to having my own band, but I dunno.. something just feels missing. That'd be the relationship factor.  I know, I know... relationships aren't the cure to all of life's problems, but I'm 24 and I've never had a proper girlfriend. That kind of shit doesn't make you feel better about yourself. People tell me I'm good looking and all, and girls have been interested in me, but they lose intrest in me as soon as I act interested in them. It's fucked. Fucked, I tell you.  If any of you girls that I've liked are reading this (fat chance, but hey, you never know), I'd be very appreciative if you'd just  urlLink let me know  why you went off me or whatever. Really.  I really wish my birthday wasn't so damned close to Valentine's day =(

      I keep forgetting what I'm going to be writing this post about.  First off,  urlLink Gmail . This screenshot alone shows why it's better than Hotmail:     On my  urlLink shiity dialup connection , Hotmail often times out when loading a page after I send an email, and so I have no idea whether it sent or not. Gmail on the other hand, is always exceedingly speedy, and so I'm in love. Microsoft and their MSN/Hotmail outfit had better do something pretty fucking special to keep people using their bloated crap.  Secondly, I downloaded and installed the latest  urlLink Firefox  - v0.9 rc1. I am of the opinion that these guys and gals spend more time designing the icons than anything else. The icons for v0.8 were nigh-on perfect, but they've gone and changed them for 0.9, and to be honest, it looks more primitive because of it. 0.8 was lush and colourful, but this is stark and Internet Explorer 3-like:     Yuck.

      Here in Australia, one of our Free-To-Air television channels,  urlLink SBS  is currently in the middle of showing the "Stanley Kubrick Collection." Fucking brilliant. It's about time we had some quality programming here, what with that Miriam bloke/sheila moving in with the Big Brother Season 4 household, and Channels 7 and 9 regularly showing complete crap, or moving their quality shows back and back, or even cancelling them in favour of the latest craze in shit TV.  Anyway, back on topic, tonight's film was  urlLink Lolita . I hadn't seen it before (along with most of Kubrick's work, I must admit), and I wasn't sure what to expect. Needless to say, I am amazed by this piece of work. No other director makes such a profound impact on me -  urlLink 2001 ,  urlLink Full Metal Jacket ,  urlLink Dr. Strangelove  and  urlLink A Clockwork Orange  all made me  feel different  after watching them somehow. The same goes for Lolita. The storytelling is executed with a grace and elegance that is missing in this day and age; at no point is the relationship between Humbert and Lolita ever clearly stated; it is told purely by implication. This may be as a result of the forced editing that Kubrick had to do, but it's still done amazingly well.  I look forward to seeing the rest of the Kubrick Collection. Well done to SBS, for having the courage to buck the trend and show us some real quality. It's just a damned shame that precious few people are going to be watching this, in comparison to the audiance of, say, Big Brother.

      So there I was, feeling all miserable and sorry for myself, when I decided to log into this Blogger thing and have an outpouring over the lack of love in my life. I sign in, and lo & behold, everything's changed. Interesting. I should probably come here more often.  The second thing I notice is a "would you like to try gmail?" link.  I think I would, thankyouverymuch for asking.  So now, I am the proud holder of a  urlLink Gmail  account. Fucking brilliant. The service seems to be fan-fucking-tastic, it's just a damn shame that nobody ever  urlLink emails me . Well I guess it's not, really, as it cuts down on the amount of spam I get.  Speaking of spam, some fucker has got my @ urlLink slowdive.net  account in thei address book or something, and I keep getting  urlLink netsky  (or similar)-infected emails. I don't know who they are, but when I find them, I'm going to impound their computer as punishment for their stupidity.  So I got a job. Yes, that's right, a Job. I bet you thought you'd never hear me utter those words, but there we go. I'm now a bike courier. That means I get paid to ride around the city all day in shorts & t-shirt, getting fit. I could do with more than just the one day a week of it though. $15/hr is OK pay, but even two days a week would make my life a lot easier. After just two days on the job, my bike died. I popped a spoke on the drive side of the rear wheel, and it cost $135 to fix up - a new wheel, plus a service. Three days later, I bought a new bike. Hopefully this one will last as long as the old one did.  My good friend  urlLink Neal Holmes  and I are planning to ride to Melbourne sometime later this year, or early next year. That should be fun... I certainly hope he's serious about it, as I'm really looking forward to it.  Speaking of Melbourne, I recently entered Valentine into the  urlLink 3MBS  Orchestra Victoria composition competition. I sure hope I win - the main prize is $6K, but even the 'encouragement award' of $2K would make things easier for me.   I see there's other  urlLink compsers  out there on this interweb logging thing. Brilliant. I'm glad I'm not alone.  I've only had time to check out one person's blog so far.  urlLink Dries  mate, I dig your musical intrests and your political views. Keep 'em coming, I say. While you're at it, could you give us better recordings of your compositions? =D  Personally, I haven't written anything in fucking ages.  urlLink Adelaide University  (the newly-formed  urlLink Elder School of Music  in particular) is an incredibly opressive place to be studying music in. The environment is that of a prison. The two student representatives of the Continuing Flinders Street School of Music Students group presented a report to the board of studies last week that brought to light many negative goings on that have happened over the last term. The Board of Studies immediately decided to push this item to be the first one on the agenda, and opened with - and I quote - "We don't like the tone of this report"  Fuck. I can't believe that. First of all,  this  report had a positive note for every negative one, while the one before it was completely negative. Secondly, what kind of reaction is that? You don't like the tone of the report? Fuck you, you're not supposed to like it. It's painting a picture of how your students are having to survive under your guidance. Fuck you. We're not 'whinging about the printers', the printers DON'T FUCKING WORK! That's a pretty fucking major thing to have fuck up, and it takes you fucking three weeks to fix them. The teaching term at this institution is only six weeks long! That means that the printers are out of order for half the term! For the love of all that is good, don't fucking fix the printers if they're older than I am, buy  new  ones! I can't fucking believe it. I am seriously tempted to just drop out of my degree right now, I don't care how close I am to getting that all-important piece of paper, I just can't deal with  urlLink incompetent fuckwits

      OK, so things are going wonderfully well this girl right now. Much better than with any other girl I've ever liked, in fact...  So why am I suddenly overcome by this paranoia that she doesn't want to continue and develop the relationship any further? We get on well together, and we enjoy each other's company to a degree I've never experienced before. There's a very definate physical attraction too.  These are all good points. Very good points. Points that have never really come up with any other girl.    So why do I have this impending sense of doom?  All I can think of is when I see her next, her sitting me down and telling me that she doesn't want to see me.  There's been absolutely no indication of her intending this to happen, or even of any negative vibes from her, but I can't help worrying myself sick over the possibility.  I guess this is what happens after so many years of being involuntarily single, you get used to rejections, and expect them to happen.     *Happy thoughts, Happy thoughts...*      "I must keep reminding myself of this..."      -MJ Keenan

      some absolute CUNT has stolen my bike.  Needless to say, I'm well pissed off - they just came in through the gate and rode off on it, I guess. The cunt.    Gives me the shits. If I catch whoever did it, I'm going to rip their head off and shit down their neck, Duke Nukem style, ffs!    I got a new phone though, it's a  urlLink Nokia 6230 , and it's sweeeeet. Pity I need to buy a data cable or a bluetooth dongle for my computer in order to use it to its full potential though =(    Oh, and that wonderful Simpsons quote, "put it in 'H'!" will never be the same to me again after this weekend ;-)

      I am not  urlLink Neal Holmes  My views are not his. Hence, they are  my  views.  If you want to harass somebody for their views, then you should be harassing the person responsible for them. My email address is freely available on this site, and a bit of simple deduction could have uncovered my @slowdive.net address too.  Sheesh.

      dammit, something's really wrong with me, I think... I can't even ask a girl out for a casual cup of coffee and a chat - in an entirely 'this is not a date' way, mind you - without fucking things up. ugh.  Sometimes I wish life had a Rewind button. What would happen if I changed that one moment just a little? What if I never told my 'friend' which girl I had a crush on? Would I be a happy man now, full of self-confidence and a wonderful girlfriend? Or would she have found out some other way and destroyed my hopes and dreams anyway?  What if I'd actually made a move on that that other girl while she still had something for me? (I did not know this at the time, of course :rolleyes: ) What if I'd told yet another girl how I felt about her a week or two earlier?   All I want is to have a relationship with a nice girl. I would give up  everything  for a decent shot at that without screwing it up somehow. But I'm still right here, feeling as miserable as ever, feeling like there's this insurmountable blockage in my path and there's nothing I can do about it. Dammit, I  want  to heal! I desperately want to forget forever that  one small moment  where it all went wrong. Why can't I fucking get over it? Why is it fucking ruining my life like this? Why can't I dwell on a single tiny moment of happiness for my whole life?  What fucked up evolutionary advantage is it that causes us to dwell on negatives and not positives?  Maybe I should just wait it out, maybe it'll happen for me one day. Maybe this is just some kind of test, and I'll be rewarded with a fantastic life later. I don't fucking care! I'm 24, and all my friends are either in great relationships, or they're happy with being single, and have at least  had  a great relationship at sometime. What the fuck is wrong? Why am I subjected to such torment?  Maybe you think I should just quit my whining and just get over it and on with it, and I must say that I'm inclined to agree with you, but every time I try to do just that, I get shot down again into this vicious circle of self-doubt and fear.  I  will  face my demons one day, and I  will  conquer them. I just wish they'd agree to it.   I miss the comfort in being sad -KD Cobain

      It seems that the more time I spend with people that make me incredibly happy, the more I get depressed when I'm not spending time with them. I'm tired of having to rely on other people for my own happiness. I'm tired of feeling the need for somebody to be by my side. It's not that I want to be alone, it's that I want to feel self-sufficient in my happiness.  Was I ever happy as a kid? I honestly can't remember. I remember hating my father from pretty much as early as I can remember, and I can remember having screaming fits about being lonely and not having any friends to play with when I was six or seven, but I honestly can't remember one moment of being truly happy. Maybe when I caught those yabbies in the pools of water that were left after a particularly heavy downpour when I was living in Casino, NSW. Or maybe when I got my very first videogame system, a Sega Master System II, and played Alex Kidd in Miracle World nonstop for six weeks.  I remember the first moment of pure emotional hurt though. The first girl I ever really truly liked (I was like, 12 1/2 or so) got wind of how I felt about her, and told me in no uncertain terms that under no circumstances would she ever go out with me. Not even if I were the last man on earth.  I was shattered.  In the grand scheme of things though, that was only a minor event, so why does it still haunt me to this day? Since then, the only girls that have wanted to go out with me have had major issues which have prevented getting together. I can count the number of those women on one hand, too.  I tell myself that I should feel lucky that women even want to be freinds with me, let alone 'something more' but then, being 'just friends' with somebody you want to be with with every fibre of your being is incredibly painful, and sometimes you wonder if it's really worth all the trouble.  So what do I do? Do I pin my heart to my sleeve and hope that somebody doesn't suddenly decide my shirt needs an ironing? Or should I just suppress it all and hope that I'll just bump into Somebody Special one day and it'll just Happen?  Is there a third option that I'm missing here? I've tried both of the other ones, and they seem to be just different paths to the same pain.  It's 3:25am, and this is the reason why I can never go to sleep before midnight unless I'm utterly exhausted.   The snake behind me hisses what my damage could have been. My blood before me begs me to open up my heart again. And I feel this coming over like a storm again. -MJ Keenan

      My course of studies is really getting to me. I may have already stated this somewhere on here before, if not, then on  urlLink Orkut , but before the Merger between Flinders Street School of Music and the Elder Conservatorium, I was pumping out more music than I knew what to do with.  Since having to attend the university, and having to put up with the bullshit administration, I've barely put out enough work to cover my own arse, let alone fulfil the course requirements. Hell, I haven't written a single piece of music this whole year so far!   If there were no rewards to reap, No loving embrace to see me through, this tedious path I've chosen here, I certainly would have walked away by now. And I still may. -MJ Keenan   My problem, is that there are no obvious rewards to reap, and there is no loving embrace to see me through. I certainly haven't walked away, but with every passing day, I come closer to it. My recital is nearly a year overdue, and even after culling  nine months  of work - my entire symphony - from it, it would appear that it's still going to be too difficult to pull off anytime soon. I'm not getting enough work as a courier to justify quitting uni altogether, and I'm just too damned close to finishing anyway. It's just a pity that the university atmosphere has sucked me dry of all desire to achieve something. Almost everything about the place is so fucking oppressive, it scares me. It makes me want to scream.   There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away. Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting. I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing. Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication. -MJ Keenan   One problem is that there's  no  communication. Students don't know wtf is going on, and the administration don't care what the students think. The only people that  do  know that things should be better are chastised for mentioning it.  Suckin up all you can, suckin up all you can suck. Working up under my patience like a little tick, fat little parasite, suck me dry. My blood is bruised and borrowed. You thieving bastards, you have turned my blood cold and bitter, beat my compassion black and blue.  Hope this is what you wanted, hope this is what you had in mind. Cuz this is what you're getting. I hope you're choking; I hope you choke on this. -MJ Keenan  Thanks for helping me make a point, and to express what I'm feeling, Maynard. You rock.

      I should start a photo gallery or something on this site, with pictures of people & places. Maybe one day*  Anyway, in the meantime, here's a photo of my two bestest buddies in the whole wide world**  This is Kirra and  urlLink Neal  - She (Kirra) is currently moving house, and so here they are having a relaxing geekfest after a hard day's works packing stuff up.   urlLink    (apologies for the shit picture quality, but my camera is.. well.. shit)  So anyway - I feel extremely lucky to know these two people. If everybody were like these two people, the world would be pretty damned boring. Because everybody would be the same. But if there were just more people like these two, then the world would be a much better place, IMO    *probably never **assuming world is pretty fucking small*** ***not really

      if you're using Internet Explorer to view this site, then don't be a fool - get  urlLink Firefox  instead.

      well that didn't go too badly =) We spent like an hour eating and talking about nothing, even though we probably should have been talking about  something , but it all seemed good.  I'm just going to focus on the positives of all this from now on. I can't let one little thing from so long ago have such a hold over me anymore.  Now as long as I can remember that, I should be fine =)
