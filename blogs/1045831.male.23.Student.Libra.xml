      Thats right folks, Your hero has decided to become a "Metrosexual."  It's only pink shirts and stylish pants from here on out.  No more beers for this man.  Guiness is replaced with a stylish cosmopolitan but until after I am done being on the trendy "South Beach Diet."  No more watching of Cartoons, Porn or CNN, only reality shows, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy and MTV.  I will still attend Willie Nelson's Fourth of July picnic but I will do it wearing an A&F cowboy hat if they make them if not I will find a womens cowboy hat and wear that.  The Journey will be long and hard but I'm sure I can make it.

      Alright folks I have been going further down the road of Metro-Sexualness.  Luckily I have a little sister because thanks to her I know I have facial products.  I have been watching Queer eye and one of the cats on there always is talking about moisturizing your face and what not so one night when I ran out of bar soap and contact solution I came upstairs at about 4am to look for some when I discovered a treasure trove of all kinds of shit in my sisters bathroom closet and cleaned her out.  I know have Facial Scrub to exfoliate, Facial Wash, Face Lotion, and shampoo and conditioner.  Yes this is about 10 times the amount of stuff I had before..  Not to mention the regular stuff I stocked up on too like Q-Tips.  So getting the skin taken care of and yes I've lost more weight, I'm now down to a slim 225.  Tomorrow I start working out.  I'm telling you, prepare yourself for the new improved Zeke.  I don't know if you folks will be able to handle it.

      Ok so I've been doing the South Beach Diet and so far it has been pretty easy.  I just eat a lot of lean meat and a lot of veggies.  I stay away from fat and carbs and that's it.  It's not hard at all except sometimes if your in the car finding something to eat isn't the easiest but I've discovered things in grocery stores and other places I can eat.  Also another hard part is no drinking but it's not hard so much that I can't drink but man hanging out with drunk people is so much more fun when you are drunk too.  How some people can do it all the time still amazes me.  But yeah I have lost 11 pounds since last Tuesday May 25.  Down from 240 to 229 and still going strong.  Next week I'm going to start working out in Lawrence when I go up there for class.  I also have been getting a lot of tips about becoming metrosexual so hopefully they will be coming.  I'm hoping to start being able to put pictures up here to document the transition from Drunk, frat, slob, party Zeke..  to Hip, Stylish, Sexy, Metrosexual Zeke..  But for now that's it..  So I'll try to keep you up dated more often..  Peace

      Last night I was up late helping whitney, Toms' Girlfriend, write her western civ paper.  I got mine done pretty early and should do well on it.  That should help me get my grade somewhere near that A that I nee.  Kind of Scared about my Physics grade though.  Doing well in all my clases but that one.  I'm going to have to go talk to her about that next week but tonight I am going to not worry about it.  I'm going to Abe and Jakes to drink beer and listen to some good tunes.

Today I have a big paper for western civ to write and then more reading to do.  I have to get it all done tonight so that fri I can go have free beer at Abe and Jakes and then go see Andrew WK on Sat.  Well thats about all I have for my first post.

      Well yesterday was another worthless day...  I got absolutely nothing done.. I tried to read for western civ but kept getting interrupted by people.  Then I just kinda hung out all night..  should have gone home..  ohh well at least my night was better than Sieckman's..  He stayed at his apt alone and got drunk drinking 40's..  Sad...  well I'm gonna go home today and read and try to do some work..  wish me luck..

      Last night I went to the Jazzhouse to see Chris Ingram's band Automn Dog play.  I wasn't going to get that drunk but of course I did...  then i went to Mark's house and played beer pong with himand his peeps..  got even drunker than walked home and called tons of girls in my phone but at least I don't remember that part.  Could tell by my called numbers.  Ohh well...  well if Catherine doesn't call me tonight I'm going to get smart and study..  might even go home and study.. that would be smarter probably..  ohh well..  i'm off to shower..

      Well even though I did pretty amazing in my Rock Chalk tryout (at least for me)..  you won't see zeke singing and dancing this year..  probably a good thing though considering what that would look like and given my college history.  But thats cool..  other than that i have completed my last days of class and now is time to study study study for finals so i'm off to do that and then go drinking for the last time for a while tonight.   Later..

      Alright my computer has been going crazy and it has been pissing me of a lot.  I had to reload some things to fix it but thats ok as long as I can hold it together for a while.  Damn I need XP.  But on a happier note I thought i was going to get like a D in physics so I went and talked to my prof and she told me that I had a 64 which scared the fuck out of me.  But then she said that with the final I could get up to an 84 because she didn't have it figured in to the grade yet so all I need is a 75 on the final to get a B.  I can handle that.  SO this semester I have the possibility to get 2 A's and 1 B but it will probably be 1 A and 2 B's..  both work for me though so it's cool.  OK I gotta go work and then to write a paper and study some.  Damn finals...

      Well I tried out for Rock Chalk today.  I didn't know if I was going to but I decided to and I think I did pretty amazing.  I might have made Claudia mad not sure though..  She is either kidding around or else she really is mad.  Ohh well she will get over it.  I am way to charming and cute to stay mad at.  Well since I didn't go work out earlier I'm going to go now and then maybe to the wheel for a beer or two...

      Today has been an extremely lazy day.  I wasted a lot of time.  Hopefully I will become more productive later on.  I think I'm going to go work out right now but who knows if I actually will.  It has been very hard to get myself motivated lately.  Tonight I have a lot to do but should end up being ok.

      This weekend was a crazy one.  Friday I went to Abe and Jakes where we had free kegs.  Got pretty drunk there.  Then a bunch of guys went to Quintons so I followed them over there.Got really really drunk.  Pulled out the phone.  Bad move when your drunk.  I talked to Niki and she decided to rive up.  I then went to the wheel were I remember very little but Fergi told me I talked to Megan Murphy for a while.  THen I was back to the house to meet Niki.  THe rest of the night is just blackness and I'm kinda glad.  I probably was did some embarrassing stuff.  well the next day i just kind of recovered and slept.  I was going to go see Andrew WK but the person I was going to go with backed out and then my car was blocked in so i just kinda watched a movie and chilled.  It was nice.  But today I have to go to the Push banquet but I am going to work out right now.

Then I went home and watched some tube and studied some more physics...  went to sleep and basically just studied and did boring things since then..  but I have done well on all my finals which is nice..  ok I just wrote some stuff cuz i felt I was slacking...  I will have more after tommorrow cuz it is my last final and then I am drinking!!!

      Alright now this is for today..  Yesterday was a fairly regular day but I felt very productve anyway.  I woke up about 2:30 (alright that is not very productive at all but it gets better).  I hung out with the fam for a little bit.  Went and worked out.  It wa a rough workout and I pushed myself real hard but that is the best way to work out. A funny thing happened though.  I was on the stairmaster (what a pussy) and was watching the chiefs game (ok he might be kinda masculine) and Trent Green almost threw an interception in the end zone.  When this happened I heard a loud thud.  I looked over and the guy to the left of me had lost balance and fel of the treadmill. Trent was not only hurting The Great Chiefs that day but also poor innocent middle aged men trying to work off the gut.  well then I went home and ate.  FInished reading Galileo.  Wrote my paper on Galileo.  Then went and rented Changing lanes and watched it with Claudia. Stayed up and talked late into the night (You can call me Mary) and then drove her home.  When I came home I was very horny and couldn't get to sleep.  It was a horrible thing to toss and turn cuz of all the God given testosterone. Ohh well..  I deal..  well I'm off to study for my Physics and West Civ tests...  Everyone out there wish me luck...

      Ok I tried to update this thing yesterday and it didn't work for some reason so here I go again... Sat night I came home, my parents were going to a Christmas party  so I took my sister out to eat.  It was me and Mags, my sister, and Toms and his GF, Whitney.  WE went and ate at Bo lings.  I tried Plum Wine and it was good.  Traded toms my plum wine for his sake cuz he didn't like it and jst enjoyed dinner.  Toms and Whitney then went home and me and Mags went and rented, "The Cradle Wil Rock."  Great flick but a little slow.  Mags went to sleep almost immediately but I couldn't get to sleep forever.  Watched a beautiful mind and a special on The "Real" Junction Boys which was pretty interesting.  Ended up asleep at like 5:30.  That was my exciting night. Yet again you might recognize that no studying took place at all.  Sad...

      Ok sorry I have been slacking so much I have been sick lately...  Friday night I went and got some dinner with Claudia at Paddy's and we started drinking.  Paul and Sieckman showed up a little later and we continued drinking...  We then headed to meet Finkle, Aaron, Kristen, Carolyn and some other folks up at Incredibowl...  Drank a litle bit more there..  socialized a little bit then Claudia and I headed back to my place drunk out of our minds and thats where the night ended.. Sat night I went and saww the Lord of the Rings: The Two Tower with McKay, His Girl, and Osty.  It was fairly dissapointing.  Sunday night I worked then went to Paddy's to see Welzenbach who was in town for a short while. That is always nice..  We hung out and talked for a while then went to Coach's where we saw Big Maroon and Joe Dirr they had just lost 50 bucks in pool and were pissed about it..  If you see Maroon ask him about it.. It's a good story.. We then saw Doug the bartender at the Peanut and he said Me and Sieckman could come back.. neat..  I still think it was more of me boycotting than me not being able to come back.. but whatever..  then the last few days I have felt like shit and done nothing but sleep, eat and watch TV..  I am so lazy...  OK well it is off to wait for Santa to bring me all his bobble heads and Simpsons figures...  Yeah me...

Then today I got up, went to class, bought some books and hung out.  Today we had a meeting to see who we were going to initiate, did that.  Decided I was going to work sat morning so I am off to home to get some sleep and do some reading before work.  Gotta prepare for Toms' birthday on sunday.  Alright well I'm off to shower and go home so Peace...

      OK i have not updated this site forever.  I have missed christmas, new years and a bunch of other random bullshit that has gone on in my life.  I have thought about catching up and writing a bunch but I decided to forget about thatand just start from today.  Last night I worked and went to Fatso's for Jay's Bday and going away party since he is going to war in Iraq along with some other guys in our house.  I had a few beers then went home.  Pretty uneventful but I think I am going to go to the wheel to hang out tonight so that should be alright, hang with some nice folks.  Alright well all this writing has tired me out.  I need to get back in training but I'll write more later.

      OK folks.. some bad things have happened to the Hero of our story recently..  Yes it's true.. Zeke (thats me!) has no more first gear in his car.  this would be ok if he lived in western KS but he lives in Lawrence, the land of many hills.  It was a serious setback to the fuure of his money making and fun having experience.  Thats ok though because a fairly amazing girl named Lauren (her stage name) has promised to ease his pain by practicing all her pleasure giving delights on his body.  What a lucky guy..  Well other than that we had initiation last night which was boring and KU and MU lost today so I went out and ate and drank with my Mom and sis and Kalina.  Didn't seem to drink enough so I'm off to the bar to continue this trend of inebriation..  More later and everyone enjoy their Superbowl extravaganzas...  Lata' Homes...

Well now that I said that classes have been going good and all basically not much new around here..  Just figured I should put that little fact down on the paper..  alright I'm off to get drunk and laugh at some funny pledge shit..  peace out my homies...

We then went ona tour of the Old Man bars in lawrence...  went to Stu's for a while..  then we went to the Shenago Lounge where to our surprise all the drinks were free...  April came and hung out with us then we went back to her house and drank some more..  then home to pass out in a lump of drunkeness..  It was a good night..

      Last night was a very odd night...  Went out for Singh's birthday. He got a keg at Quintons on 23rd.  I was sick so I took a nap and watched the last few minutes of the KU-TX game (great game by the way).  Then headd over to Quinons and had like 2 beers, stayed sober.  There were some drunk fools there though.  One of my Bro's little sister's came around trying to collect money for the keg or something and offfered to take her shirt of for 7$.  Then went on about how she wasn't a cheap whore and wouldn't get anyone a (free) beer from the bar but would flash her tits for 7$.  Then proceeded to go and puke in the bathroom.  Then Nate and his ex got in a big fight.  Then I get a call from sieckman about how JP just got arrested for running over the Airconditioning units outside their apt.  He went and got an OUI and I guess blew a .228.  What a drunk..  I went over and checked out the damage then came home and went to sleep...  What a crazy night..

      Yesterday I was sick yet again..  (This morning I woke up and Yes still sick)  So I didn't go anywhere for the super bowl. Stayed home ate pizza and watched at my house.  On a good not ethough I did win 5 dollars from Vanderet because he was dumb enough to bet on  the Bucs.  I wandered downstairs late last night and ended up getting into a game of RISK (I took someones spot and it was the first time I played so I'm not as big a loser as it sounds..) We ended up just hanging out and talking about funny sexual encounters and things we can do to improve the house...  Intresting night but I ended up setting my alarm wrong so I missed my first class..  Well I'm off to shower now and head to my next class but I'll probably be back to write something else later today.  I remembered some stuff that happened that I hadn't written about..  I think it was too tramatic and I blocked it out..  Well in the famous last words of Anna Pavlova "Get my swan costume."  I'm outta here..

      Last night I intended to go to the bar and have a great time but I started to feel lousy.  So I drank some more to try to feel better but it didn't seem to work.  I instead of having fun at the bar had a quiet night at home.  Watched Reign of Fire. Don't expect any acadamy awards for that flick. Then I ent downstairs to get some water and ran into a couple of my boys and we hung out and chatted a little.  Then I went back upstairs to escape the rediculous drunks.  Some of these kids were so hammered they kept calling me different names.  Ohh well I escaped back upstairs and to bed I went.  A very exciting night if I do say so myself..  ;-) Stay tuned for the next fun filled installment of the Life and Times of  Zeke-Man !!!

      Last night was a crazy drunken night..  I was supposed to go see Jason Boland and the Stragglers with Toms but the band decided that a little snow on the ground was too extreme for them so they canceled the show.  So instead we got drunk and went to Last Call, which is a new bar and will probably be cool once people start going there..  When  we were going in were were the ony guys in the place other than the bouncers, yet they still question my id (22 fucking yrs old)...  When they have decided I'm old enough they let us in a we just hang out and play a new golf game PGA open or something (Toms like it a lot more than me even though I still beat him by like 2 strokes)..  then we decided to go to the sandbar at like 12:00..  at this point I am pretty drunk..  When we get there they question my id again..  I give them another form then they decide they can't let me in...  They have a scanner and just don't use it..  dumb bastards..  so me and toms go to meet his girl at Brothers..   this saga continues but I gotta run to class real fast and then I will complete the tale...

      Alright back to the continuing saga of Zeke and his crazy little life...    Ok well maybe that was a bit of an exaggeration not much has really happened..  Got over my pink eye, still got the sniffles but I can deal with that...  Got to deal with West Civ. as usual...  Ohh I am going to apply to bartend at the Bottleneck which would end up being a very cool job.  Lots of great bands coming through there..  And also going to see Jason Boland and the Stragglers tonight which will be fun...   Other than that not much going on.. So i'm off to get in the shower and in the words of Henry Hyde, "The statute of limitations has long since passes on my youthful indescretions."  Probably doesn't apply to me but I liked the way it sounded..  Peace out folks and if ya believe in the man upstairs maybe give him a shout out for me and see if he'll help with the job..

Ahh but on a good note I did find the perfect graduation present for Toms'..  It's probably the most perfect thing I have ever seen but don't expect me to say what it is here..  no surprise equals no fun.. lets just hope I'm better by thurs for the Jason Boland concert...

      Sorry all you avid fans of my life there hasn't been much going on but I realized that I haven't updated you on what happened with JP's arrest.  When he got released he decided that he needed to dedicate himself to finding a lawyer and getting out of his situation.  This he decided would take a couple days a week for the rest of the semester so he dropped all his tues and thurs classes (yet another bad decision).  THen he just sat around on his ass and watched TV and slept untill Sat night when he decided to go out and get hammered again and Walk home from the Hawk (What an Idiot).  Ohh well I guess some people never learn but as for me I have been sick but I did manage to buy my sister Toby Keith tickets for her birthday (there went 100$) and I slept and tried to get well.  Right now I'm off to take a picture of the damamge JP did so I can send it to everyone so they can all witness the destruction first hand...  I will leave you now with some words of hope... "when the gunsmoke settles, we'll sing a victory tune and all meet back at the local saloon"  Well at least it's hopeful to me..  Let the love of Willie Nelson grow in all your hearts...

      Well last night was not that exciting just a pleasent night spent with some of my buddies from the dorm I hadn't seen for a while.  It was nice.  I also cut all of Paul's hair off.  He came back and didn't want his hair anymore and so I went over and borrowed Toms' clippers and bam he is almost bald.  It was fun.  BUt right now I gotta go jump in the shower and play some guitar before my lesson.  Then it is off to work..  Everyone have a happy Valentines Day and find someone to love and if you don't have one well you can always take turns loving me..  Go out and spread your seed loved ones.. I'm out..

So have no fear I will be back and better than ever soon..  Ohh yeah.. I have a fun goal that I am working on but i can't say what it is but all you people who have "Faith" just a little help from the man upstairs would be nice...  Thanks..  Peace out all my homies..

      Alright last night We had a party and I didn't go cuz I'm a loser.  Actually I fell asleep real early and then decided that hunting a costume down in the last few moments of the night would not be worth it.  Even though People did come in a keep waking me up, it's a frat house and i knew that stuff when I signed on.  And thats the fun stuff anyway keeps me from becoming a hermit.  The best though was Lasher (Loecher..  i know how to spell it) came in at like 2:30 and needed someone to ref his boxing match with Walker.  So i went down and watched these two drunk fools duke it out.  It was very, very humurous but Lasher did pretty well especially considering the drunk factor.  But other than that I read some more for my speech I have to write for tues. on my main man  urlLink Hunter S. Thompson .  It should end up being pretty interesting.  But i also have a Western Civ paper due Wed.  which will be rough so I don't know if I'm going to go out at all this weekend.  I probably will end up going out tonight though..

      Alright I'm back again..  Things I don't understand..  I went to go check on the job I applied for at the Bottleneck and they told me they already hired the position..  They were just looking for one cocktail waitress...  When i went in they made a point to say to apply for bartender and door man..  You look at me and know I am in no way a cocktail waitress..  The big red headed cocktail waitress..  just imagine me in a pair of tight pants walking around taking drink orders..  doesn't work that well..   well anyway..  Friday I went to work and then I went to McBrides had a few Beers with Bonomo and Sieckman then to Coach's with them...  Sat I hung out with my mom for a while.. we went to the Kona grill cuz my Dad and Sis were out of town..   It was pretty good..  I drank some scotch and ate some Sushi..  Then went to Lawrence and to Toms'..  I went to the bars wth Toms, Sieckman, Whitney and this girl Kim who came up to see Sieckman..  She was pretty hot and I guess after the bar her and Sieckman had some crazy sex which Is good for him...   Other than that not much happened just a traditional sat night..  Ohh I forgot to say that Paul got mad at me for some stupid shit and started acted like a four year old..  That kid acts more like a chick than most girls I know..  Who can explain these things..  Well I'm off to jump in the shower and go work out.. I'll comfort you guys with more tales of my life later..  Your Hero..  Zeke

      Throughout this whole ordeal I have always said what I did was wrong and that I was willing to fix it..  Seickman decided that he isn't even man enough to tell me to call me and let me know what was going on..  Ohh well this is shit I can deal with..   I just feel bad for Sieckman.. The man with no friends..  I want everyone to look at this and realize how Sieckman treats people in hard times..  not well..  Ohh well not like he had any real friends to begin with so for him not a big loss..  I have been told repeatedly to stop even talking to Sieckman because he is a shitty person which most people can tell just from his actions..  It is my fault for not listening to their advice and I just want to thank sieckman for teaching me a valuable lesson and making it so that he will never again be in any part of my life..  That alone would have been worth it at twice the price...  Sieckman reminds me of a quote from my man Einstein, "Only two things are infinite, the universe and human stupidity, and I'm not sure about the former."

      How many people ever wonder why they are friends with someone...  Someone who you helped and stuck your neck out for in times when no one else would and you didn't really want to but since they were your friend you did..  This is my problem right now..  I stuck my neck out for Sieckman for years..  When no one else wanted anything to do with him I was there for him..  When he screwed me by fucking up MY car I let it slide because I was afraid of the consequences for him with his parents and with his whole life...  Now when things are on the other foot he seems to show no remorse in doing everything he can to screw me over..  he could treat me as a friend and do everything he can to get this matter resolved painlessly and effeciently..  I am doing everything in my power to get the situation fixed as soon as possible so that it can be resolved and move on..  When he doesn't put himself in other peoples positions or even look at the things that they have done for him in the past it makes me wonder why I ver hung out with him in the first place and really just makes me want to get the situation over with so I never have to have anything to do with him again...  I feel sorry for him because I don't think he realizes that by his actions he is alienating the few people who have ver stood by him and stood up for him when his life was real shitty..  Ohh well I guess friends aren't as important to him as to me and that is why he will be without very many for a good long while...  All decisions have consequences and i am dealing with mine and it's hard but I don't know if he realizes the impact his decisions will have on him..  Some people have different priorities..   I am reminded of the quote "A real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out."

      OK last night I wrote a bunch of my paper but I realized that it sucked.  So I wrote my teacher got an extension and now I have almost finished a better version but it still need a lot of editing.  This paper is fairly odd and giving me a lot of trouble but I swear to Jebus that it will be awesome by tommorrow.  But I'm off to make a bunch of money to pay for my stupidity tonight so all you kids out there have fun while I'm slaving for the man..  and in the memorable words of Nik Loecher, "I'm out like Kyle Wilson in a dodgeball game."

      Alright got my speech done last night at like 3:30.  Then I had to get up and give it at 9:30 this morning without ever practicing.  I thought I did terribly but my teacher actually complimented my speech and didn't compliment anyone else which is a good sign.  BUt i still have a Western Civ paper to write but I think that I should be alright with this..  I'm still gonna try and get an extension but hopefully I won't need it...  My manager at work also called and said he had a bunch of shifts for me to pick up which means money which I need.  Seems like things are really falling together...

I did write the speech at 3:00 am and no I didn't have any time to practice or sleep but I did get the only A and so far I have gotten an A on everything in that class.. I am such a stud.. just had to tell someone about.. I hope everyone the same god grades as I have been getting..  and lets just hope those grades go for my other classes as well...

      Lots of reading today.. I got a big Anthropology test tommorrow and class might be cancelled it probably won't but it might.. Everything on campus after 5:00 tonight was canceled because of an ice storm..  Everyone is going out tonight to have fun, get drunk and try to get young women to bear their breasts..  I would like to be a part of this debauchery but alas I am taking the safe road and staying in and studying even though there is a chance I might not have to take my test..  It will be an easy test and I wouldn't drink more than 2 or 3 beers but still would be fun to be out and about..  I am torn on wanting this test canceled and not wanting to have stayed in studying all night for nothing..  ohh well either way I will do well and get good grades which is the most important thing I guess..  The responsible Zeke is coming about ever so slowly..  well I'm going to hit the books again but I'm going to leave you with a quote from one of my favorite people ever, Jake Blues himself, John Belushi, "Don't Leave."  He said this to the girl he was with right before he died.  She left and the next day they found him dead in bed.  That was March 4th, 1982..  21 years ago.. so I want everyone to give a shout out to my man John today..  I miss him..

      Well this weekend was filled with three things, Work, Work and more work but it is OK because I was going to go see my man Willie Nelson tonight.. Me and times met at my house and drove to columbia and got there at 7:30 when the doors were to open.. when we got there of course there was a sign on the door that read "Sorry, Willie is sick the show has been postponed."  Yeah so we ended up sitting in a bar watching the KU game and chatting to some MU kids..  they were all nice and it was a nice night except for the driving but ohh well that I can deal with.. just got to get studying for my test on Wed..  wish me luck..  Ohh yeah and if anyone sees Nikki (whats the deal with two K's) tell her I won the bet because it ended on the 28th..  good job for me marking it on my calendar..  Just a reminder to all of you, "Zeke knows..."

      OK this weekend was filled with work and play..  Friday night I took my little sister to the Toby Keith concert, I bought her the tickets for her birthday cuz she is a big Toby Keith fan.  The cancert sucked..  It was real cheesy and filled with rednecks..  a terrible time and 4 hours of driving on top of that but ohh well she's my sister so gotta give her some love..  Sat I worked all day and made some much needed cash and then went to party up in lawrence for rock chalk.. Claudia came up and it was fun..  Sun I worked all day again what a surprise..   then Monday I took my Midterm in West Civ 2 that I didn't study for because of all the other stuff in my life but still think I did real well on.. not a big deal cuz I took it pass fail but still makes a brother feel good to know I did well..  then that night McKay came up so i went to the wheel and kicked it with him.. That was cool and makes me look forward to April when I will be up kicking it with him in Yale and in NYC with Rife..    But i'm back to work and would like to end this entry from a quote by the King of Late night himself, Johnny Carson, "My success just evolved from working hard at the business at hand each day."  And thats what I'm back to doing.. Peace out brotha's, The Zekemeister...

      God its been like 2 weeks since I updated this thing.. Well it's because I have been extremely busy with school and work and then St. Patrick's day was an all day affair...  Me, Toms and Pike went to the Parade at 11:30 am..  Toms immediately got hammered.  we stayed there for a while then headed to westport for a few more hours..  Seeing people we knew and getting drinks bought for us all along the way..  Then out to JoCo for the remainder of the nigh..  PJ's, Paddy's and McBrides..  a long crazy drunken night with too many stories to list them all here..  As for the rest of the week it was filled with lots of work..  I have grown to hate work but that is OK cuz I have tons of cash saved and no longer have anything expensive to waste it on except my trip to New HAven...  Thank the lord for the American system of Law and Insurance Co.'s...  well Other than that I have a bunch of school work to get to so I will be busy for a while..  Sorry I couldn't be more detailed with the excitement that is my life but I am tired and have been super busy..  BUt I'm going to end with a quote from the smartest man I know..  me..  "Wake up every morning with a smile in your heart, a twinkle in your eye and a blonde in your bed and everything will be ok..."  School calls..  peace kids..

      OK so maybe I lied about the every other day thing but I'm working on it.  Friday I went to the royals game.  We of coarse won because we have the greatest baseball team in the country..  OK maybe not but they are undefeated..  Eat that Yankees...  Then Saturday I had to work which sucked hut then I came back and celebrated the win of the Jayhawks...   The craziness was awesome..  filled mass street.. and then to a keg party to say whats up to my old roomie...  didn't really get drunk but had a few beers and rejoiced..  It was a good night..  Now it's lots of work...  Paper and speech to write...  So i'm off...  but only 3 days till Yale...

      OK time for Yale stories..  Well It's thurs night and McKay has his secret society stuff so i got to The Bar with some of his buddies...  It's dollar night and we are drinking heavily.  We keep drinking and drinking and so by the time McKay shows up I am drunk and I get some Pizza and then we roll to the after party.  Well this after party is free beer and wine and shit so I'm drinking a beer and talking to people when I see this girl trying to open a bottle of wine with a knife.  I go over to help her open it.  We start shotting the shit and it turns out she's from Austin, so were talkin' Texas music and some stuff like that..  and then some dude comes and snags the bottle or whatever and I'm out of beer at this point so I say goodbye and go to get another beer.  As I'm walking away the guy who's place it is, I met earlier, Snags me and asks me if I knew who I was talking to.  I said Yeah, Barbara from Texas.  He was like Barbara Bush..  I said, "Thats a wierd name."  He said, "Thats the Presidents daughter."  So that was the story of me kicking it with the presidents daughter..  Tha is just one of the many stories from Yale..  The others soon to come..  "Zeke eat's soul food in harlem"  "Zeke Threatening Rich Kids with  a Bowie KNife"..  Yes, You are reading Zeke's Blog and We will b back after paying some bills...

      Well I meant to put some more Yale stories on here but I didn't..  Most of it was getting real wasted and being crazy..  I rmember parts of being in McKay's buddy Eric's frat house and Talking about how you need to keep the dope fiends at bay and the Bowie knife is the best means of this..  I attribute that to reading too much Hunter Thompson..  Drinking and Hunter thompson seem to go hand in hand but really just make me act even nuttier than usual.  But anyway on to more of my life about  2 weeks since I have written anything..  Last weekend we had Formal at the Hyatt.  Yeah thats right, Zeke dressed up.. what a scary thought..  I took claudia and it was fun..  Paul and Kristen went too and there are some photos of it at  urlLink here ..  Kristen and paul were there but of course they went to bed early because they can't hang with the king of all partying..  yours truly..  Me and claudia stayed up drinking late into the night.. hanging out with everyone having drunken conversations and a generally good time...  Then we went to bed and after claudia fell asleep I got hungry and room service was closed so I went to check out the minibar.  Of course no prices listed on there so I called down tot he desk..  Multiple times just because I was drunk and stupid which tends to happen..  They sent up someone with a list of all the prices..  of course 1.50 for a candy bar and 2.5 for some pringles is expensive but I was drunk so i ate one of each.. then had the wise ideas to seal the stuff back up and put it back..   Screwed the hotel out of some chips and chocolate.. I am such a smart kid..  well  I'm in the middle of a war with my coms teacher right now and I have to finish my speech So I'm off to do that  but I just figured i would give you guys an update since I haven't for so long..  Tommorrow is Bar Golf and I plan on winning so there should be some kind of good stories from that.. If i remember it...  I'll have two steak sandwhiches and a bloody mary, put it on the Underhill acount..

      I see beauty as something to be objectified, Michaelangelo's david, The sistine chapel  Things not to be consumed, true beauty in people is a rarity, not to be ingested by the faint of heart, Something to be admired,  A love to extreme for the average joe, standing waiting for a kiss from you, sporting shades so I can look cool, Waiting for the embrace from you,  I dream of the love I wil never receive, I only have myself to give, Not the world or it's castles, I'm only  one man in this world,  IT seems that life passes you by, People slip in and out, Dreams come and go, Yet you stay till my sadness ends,  My emotions all depend on you, Life, Sadness, Pain, These are thing there is no escape from, Your life inflects on me,  I deal and live, I'm here for you and me, No ryming or reason, Just meaning  Pain and sorrow, I hope you understand my life I'm here to live So lets enjoy what we got, We won't get much more.

Love is the life for me, Passion growing all for thee, I can't help but drink my way, Living life for a brand new day,  Reading, growing, I know whats new, Living for a brand new you, I have a dream for lifes new trail, Give me a boat to sail,  Sail away into my dreams, Living life for the new me, Living, Loving thats all I know, Soon I'll find a place to grow,  The passion that I'll know I'll find, Growing ripe upon the vine, This is my life I see Living for a brand new me.

       This is a disclaimer.  This is not the normal drunken ramblings your used to.  Zeke is about to talk about serious subjects such as love and other things as that.  If you are looking for fun silly topics turn back now.   How many guys have been attracted to women without any idea why.  The girl you are attracted to isn't better looking then the other girls and there isn't anything really physically different about them than anyone else yet there is something about them that catches your eye.  This intangable (sp?) quality is what I refer to as "The Spark."  "The Spark" is something you can only see when looking in a girls eyes.  It's a glow that you can catch burning from deep within their soul.  These women are totally unaware they have it.  They just think that men are drawn to them and don't even try to explain why.  These are the girls with inner beauty sometimes as well as outer beauty.  This confidence and personality that they have is unmistakable and most men can see they possess it.  Yet there is an anomaly about "The Spark."  The annomally is that "The Spark" sometimes appears differently to different people.  Some people call this types but I don't believe that.  I just think that there are different types of flames inside of people that burn at different intensities that others appreciate more.  Soem burn too bright and others too dim.  It's your own preference yet some have no spark at all.  These are sad folk that people can recognize almost instantaniously.  These sad cases settle for other non spark carrying folk or sometimes luck out and find someone who has that spark who can not find themselves anyone who recognizes it who they find acceptable.  The worst case though is those girls ( i say girls because that is the sex I can see "The Spark" in.  I'm sure this happens in both sexes) who's spark burns out.  I'm not going to say who I have seen do this because they might read this but buy me a few beers and I'm sure I will tell you.  Their is nothing sadder than a girl who is not only beautiful but glows from within because of a fire in her soul.  These girls who think lowly of themselves and let lesser men blow their spark away and turn them into shells of the person they were are the saddest beings on the planet.  Honestly nothing makes me feel worse about life than people such as these.  This is written to all these girls to remind them to keep the flame burning.  THe passion that fuels the flame is all you need.  Feed the fire and life will turn out ok.  If the fire dies out you will end up with an insurance salesman husband wondering how your life turned out the way it did.    This is not only an informative session about "The Spark" so that people know they have it but also advice to look for this passion burning in others.  This passion can light up a room and these are the people you want to be near for your lifetime.  A little advice from a failed romantic trying to find the things he's lost.  Sometimes I will find them but hopefully You will read this before you ever lose them.  Just something to keep in mind.  As always to end my writing I would like to quote a man, not just any man, but The Man for his time and place, Willie Nelson.                         How's your new love,                         I hope that he's doin' fine                         Heard you told him,                          That you'd love him till the end of time                         Well you know, that's the same thing                         that you told me                         Well it seems like just the other day                         Mmm, ain't it funny how time slips away  Just a song that I love and reminds me a lot of life.

      OK as usual I lack the ability to sleep.  Even though I do have to wake up in 3 and a half hours.  If I could find a job that would let me work any hours I want I would be the most productive human being ever I think because at this time of night I just want to accomplish something.  Professional writer would work but for you kids who read my earlier poetry that probably isn't an option.  Ohh well.. I guess I will have to get with the real world at some point.  Ohh well...  I guess since there is no crystal ball to tell me the future I will have to rely on the old magic eight ball...  Well I asked the magic eight ball if I will ever fit in as a successful member of society and it comes back with...  (drum roll)  "It is decidedly so"  Ok so I guess I'm safe for now so I will let all you other sleepers get on with your life.  I'm out to try to sleep or at least maybe write some emails and watch Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure.  So  on that note I will leave you with a last that from Bill S. Preston Esquire, "Be excellent to each other."   NIght kids..  Maybe I will be back later for more late night madness...

      WEll Last night was a fun night...  I only did a little homework and the kid who's room I'm moving into hasn't moved out yet.. what a bitch..  so i decided to go out and grab a drink.. Me and Harpole went to the Sandbar and hung out there for a little bit.  we had a few margaritas (Yes I was Wearing my skirt) then we moved on to the meat market which was a pretty cool place.  Had abeer and then decided to roll home.  On our way home we saw Goodvin and some guys driving so we called them and they were going to Fatso's so we decided what the hell and we went to Fatso's too.  Dollar anything so I was drinking Shiner Bottles all night..  Then Harpole left so I got a ride home with Goodvin which was similar to Mr Toad's wild ride.  Craziness ensued from there but I have to go to work right now so I will have to leave you kids hanging...  Sorry..  Your Exhalted Leader, King Zeke.

      OKk lately all the stuff I have been writing on here is poetry or my deep thoughts or whatever but now I'm going to go back to the normal everyday entries of whats going on in my life.  Well at least for this post.  I have been so Unreal busy everyday.  I am in class at 1:00-4:00 every day then I come home and get changed and go to work where I work till 11:00.  Then back doing homework for a few hours then I repeat the whole process.  Throw in some other craziness with some stuff in my life and you can get the picture that things have been fairly hectic.  But I did have time to go to Scott Roseman's bachelor party last saturday which was cool cuz I got to see a bunch of kids I haven't hung out with since high school.  That was the bright spot in my life along with sometimes I get to talk on the phone a little bit everyday.  Other than that if you don't talk to me this is why and sometime I will squeeze some time in there for ya.  Other than that it's off to move rooms and do homework.  Maybe I will get to go grab a quick drink.  Damn..  Je vous manque

      Just because I say that things aren't drunken ramblings doesn't mean I wasn't drunk when I wrote them.  Just that they aren't silly stupid things because I was most definately drunk when I wrote my last entry.  But sometimes you have to love the openness that alcohol brings you.  It can bring out feelings and thoughts you didn't know you had or couldn't put a finger on.  Just another great thing beer can do.

      Ok..  so today I had my first test of the summer..  what a terrible set of words to put together.. Test and summer should never be in the same sentence together except maybe to say, "I better test this drink to make sure I put enough booze in it."  BUt i survived and I think I did quite well.  Then I went off to work and then home to hang out some and read some Langston Hughes which is actually pretty good.  I then decided to throw in Easy Rider a movie i have wanted to see for a long time but never got the oppertunity.  It was a pretty good flick.  Kinda odd but good.  I did get the feeling throughout the whole thing that I should be smoking a joint though.  Lots of drug use in this movie but it was cool.  Makes me want to get a motorcycle and ride it across America (my Mom would kill me if I ever got on a motorcycle).  Then I sat down to read a little and drift off to sleep which I couldn't do totally so i decided to update this little journal of mine.  Myabe entertain the millions of my adoring fans with some boring tidbits of my life.  But for now I'm off to try to crash again.  Got a busy day ahead of me and hopefully I will be able to grab a drink tommorrow.  Your Biker in Spirit and 21st century cowboy, Zeke.  I'll leave ya with a quote from Easy Rider since I'm in the mood...   Wyatt : You ever want to be somebody else?  Stranger : I'd like to try Porky Pig.

      I am so pissed right now at one of the guys in our house.  I honestly think some kids just don't know when they are being douchebags but I have reached my limit and I am done with that bullshit.   But now on to some more interesting fun type stuff...  Last night me and a couple guys were out grabbing some food and we met this guy who was teaching at Bill Self's KU Basketball Camp and he was looking for a place to go drinking.  I started to give him directions to the bull and the I decided what the fuck just come home with us we got beer...  Got to drinking and then we went out with some guys from the house to The Bull and then The Wheel.  At the Wheel these old guys were buying us beer and telling us all these crazy stories, It was funny.  Then Anne showed up and since Claudia was there craziness ensued.  The wierdest shit was Anne saying she could Black Mail me with something but then not telling me what.  But she said she wouldn't cuz she was nice.  It was wierd shit going down at the old Wheel.  But you know what they say...  "When the going gets wierd, the wierd turn pro."

      OK basically I was going to the bathroom and I couldn't sleep and the thought, "I have a strange arrangement with my body," came into my head,  I really liked this phrase and thought.  the way it sounded and kinda what it meant.  The post I then wronte came from that but really had no meaning to me just strange words put into a thought.  It was and odd sensation but one I enjoyed.  Just kinda clarification because I can see that being odd to some people.  just a little insight to how my mind works.  Your loving host..  Zeke

      I have a wierd arrangement with my body, It seems the more I think and feel the less it wants to sleep.  This is an unusual agreement seeing as I have always viewed myself as one being not mind and body separate.  This is starting to change as of late though.  It's when my body is exhausted and my mind is clear that these things start to become known.  If my life could combine itself to work together things would be much more recognizable as a simple understanding of being.  Ohh well life is like this as Avril Levine would say.  You know how I love quoting the great mins of our time.  I'm off to read some Kerouac and try to get the team back together again.  Who knows what will work but if  anything it will be fulfilling..   Later Folks..

      I just went and emptied my bank account so that I could bail one of my buddies out of jail.. Because of this i can't take tommorrow of like iwould have liked to..  I can't talk to the women I would like to.. I will have to be alone as I have been for most of my life.. all the girls that I want to spend time next to meare busy doing other things so I will be at work or writing or listening to music or just plain doing other things..  There are women that I have wanted to spend time with for years and that wil lnever happen and I am used to it..  I know this sounds liek a pitiful sap but I am strong and not going to be weakened by anyone..  I will listen to my music and be  happy and proud and love myself in the way that I have my whole life.. I wish you were as lucky as me to be as proud of the life ou lead as me.. here is some tunes by the Dropkick Murphys that help me get on with life when all the beautiful people want nothing from me but to be "Good friends"...   I'm a pitiful site  And I ain't all that bright  I'm definitly not chisled from stone  I'm a cheat and a liar  No women's desire  I'll probably die cold and alone   My good buddies The Murphys...

      I wake up in the night with a picture of a girl, She has all the things I dream of I know this girl in life Yet she has wont acknowledge me Passion is a wild thing Something you cant capture in a net, Wrap your arms around, Or put in a headlock, Friends dont understand my loneliness I just dream of showers Pouring down my passion on true beauty Blonds scare me in this way This is not true poetry Just lines that I feel intense feelings for, I am way drunk  Yeat bowing in pain like a tree to the winds, I cant wait till august, My dream swill be acknowledged by the women around me Dreams I have That cant be made real without true heat I am full of fire And thats all I need I am fire Im going to hell If your not going there Ill send you a postcard Passion is a ticket straight to fire So at least Ill be warm instead of board  Blonde dreams. Thi sis awful poetry but I have feelings I can't explain through good poetry so I chose bad stuff to fulfill my expectations..  Whats funny is that this won't do anything for my chances with the beauty I dream of..

      Ok..  I promised more in depth adventures about Willie's 4th of july picnic...  Well I figured that if I wrote down al the things that happened to us we cuold make a whole movie out of it so I'm just going to give a few Highlights..  The number one highlight was seeing willie a bunch of times in 2 days..  He would come out with almost every band and he did a whole blues set himself in the middle of the second day. it was all amazing and if I ever get a tat  i am going to get wilie's autograph on my body over my heart..  It would signify a love that is hard to compete with no matter how much sex we have...  but the first day all we did was get drunk and listen to music.. it was amazing..   It reaffirmed my love for music..  the second day we didn't really drink very much but we stil just chilled and listened to tunes..  we met all kinds of wacky people and had everyone who met us act like they had known us forever..  all this experience did was reaffirm my love for texas..    I was goig to end with a quote about Texas (A state that I love) but I found this and it is so me it's scary..  so here it is..  "Anyone who is considered funny will tell you, sometimes without even your asking, that deep inside they are very serious, neurotic, introspective people." - Wendy Wasserstein

      Ok Thurs me and Kit left for Texas...  WE had no where to stay so as we were rolling through Oklahoma I started making calls...  Considering that it was the day before the fourth almost everyone I knew was out of town.  This made it rough.  Finally I got a hold of Stephanie, Younger's GF and she was heading to her bar but said we could stay with her but we had to meet her at the bar.  You know me that was a real sacrifice.  So we get to the bar and are treated to all free drinks and we were hanging out with Steph and her buddy having fun.  Then After the bar closed we hit Whataburger fora delicious breakfast burrito.  Then we went home looked at some pictures and chatted awhile.  Played with some cats and then crashed on an air mattress that she had for us.  It was a great way to end a long day in the car.  I will tell some more about the actual concert later....

I guess thats all I can say about that...  Peace out kids..  In closing here's a little nascar philosophy, because as you know all great philosophers were nascar fans..  "Some days you're the bug.

      OK this is the third time I've written this, goddamn internet but here it goes again.  I have not written in this thing for like 2 months.  Which is irrisponsible and pretty nuts but thos of you that know me know that I am irrisponsible and a little nuts.  I'm not going to try to recount what has happened in the last two months but I will start from where I am now.  I'm going to try to go back to updating this every few days like I used to. So here it goes...  This week a lot of big things happened to me.  First of all I bought a car, a '99 4 door blazer.  This is a big deal because I have never owned any car newer than 10 years old.  It's a good truck and I love it.  The only thing is that now I have a car payment but I guess I have to get responsible at some time.  Also this weekend I went up to Omaha with Toms, Paul and Ryan Miller.  It got a little crazy but all I'm going to say about it was that it ended up with an ambulance, fire truck and 2 police officers showing up and me spending 5 hours in the emergency room.  So my advice to all of you is to not piss off Claudia unless you have a lot of time on your hands.  No hard feelings though..  But I have to go do some homework so that I can go to the wheel for my weekly meeting of the Alcoholic Enthusiest Support Group.  BUt I want to leave you with this thought, If I had my life to live over again I would live over a bar. Peace out Kids..

      OK I'm not doing good in my promise of updating this thing regularly but with the Internet in the House being fucked up with viruses on people's computer's and me having a bunch of tests this is the best I can do.  Well Friday night I got ridiculously drunk and was just out of control.  NOt a real great state to be in.  I think I made a big ass out of myself a bunch of times but who cares, I'm young and it's going to happen.  I have tons of tests and speeches this week.  Have a huge take home test in Rhetoric which is kicking my ass and a music test in like 15 min and speech next week and tons of other stuff.  But I think I'm going down to Texas to se the greatest musician of all time, Willie Nelson, on the 11th.  Just 3 days after my 23rd birthday.  Happy Birthday to me.  That should be a great time. I'm sure theres more to say but I gotta run to my test or I'm going to be late which won't be good.  I'll try to get back to you folks later when i have some more meaningful wisdom to impart upon you.  Until then, Keep it real...

      Ok I have been very bad at this but the interent is working amazing now and I should be able to update regularly.  Last wednesday was my birthday.  I turned the big 23.  Not very exciting night though.  Went to dinner with my parents and grubbed my ass off.  Nice fat prime rib and a bunch of guinness.  Then i went to the bar with toms and a bunch of my boys.  Got ridiculously drunk and had a fun time.  And now for my birthday present to myself.  I'm off to see my main man Willie Nelson in Fort Worth, TX.  Should be a great time but I gotta run.  I'll give you guys the update on those things are going when i get back.  Peace out all my loyal disciples.

      THis weekend Paul and I took a trip down I-35 to the great state of Texas.  This weekend ended up being a lot different then what I imagined it would be.  It all started off on friday night.  after a long drive down Paul and I went straight to the bar.  Kristen had other plans which kept her from joining us (these will make you laugh later).  At the bar I begin drinking Pearl in the can which for those of you who don't know is the oldest beer brewed in Texas, and yes it is dirt cheap.  We play pool for a few games while a couple of older ghetto ladies made dirty remarks to us.  ONe of my favorite was when one of them was picking out a pool cue, help it up next to her, Because she had to have a stick that reached her tonsils.  Well I beat paul 3 games in a row and began feeling the booze I was drinking. We then met a guy named Daniel and hung out somemore drinking beer and just being good kansas boys in Texas.  Eventually we decide we want to go somewhere else so I ask the door man and he tells me to go to the "Boom Boom Room," thats right the "Boom Boom Room."  Well me meet people and get shots bought for us and have a good time.  Met an interseting girl named Larimie, but that is another story. Anyhow we go back to Kristens place which is a gated apt. complex so we have to wait for someone to come in so we can get in.  Kristen still isn't home so we go inside and hang out.   I then get a call from Kristen saying I need to go let them in the gate.  I go to let her and her "date" in the gate.  Yet I am drunk and in the mood to get in a fight at this point so when the gate opens I go and open the drivers side door well prepared to pull the guy out and fight him.  (I'm such a meat head)  But when I looked in a saw this weenie I couldn't do it.  I still tried to talk him into fighting me but I offered to let him hit me in the face a couple times first to even it out.  He didn't go for it so I got in the car and just tried to be annoying because I figured maybe it was a blind date and kristen didn't know what was going on.  I thought I would be doing her a favor.. I wasn't..  This was of her own free will..  What a drop since the other guys she has dated.. I mean even from Aaron.  (J/K I love ya Aaron).  Well that is basically the end of the first night except I did get real pissed off for a while but that didn't really affect anything.. it was after everyone went to sleep..  The next day is coming up..

      OK so we wake up Saturday and get ready.  Her friend Kathryn Murphy came over and this girl is funny, not as funny as me but funny.  ;-)  Well we all go out to eat at Uncle Julio's for some good Mexican food.  Me and Kathryn start drinking by getting their signature drink, "The Twist."  It definitely had some booze in it though, that is where Kristen dropped the Bomb, Her man from the night before was  31 .  Yeah I couldn't believe it either, Old Balls.  But whatever after that we went and they took us to one of the greatest things I have ever heard of.  A drive through Daquari stand.  You can drive up to this place, order a daquari, in one of 32 different flavors, add extra shots of liquor if you want.  A great concept and a great start to the day.  After that it was fairly uneventful afternoon, watched "The Cutting Edge" and slept. For dinner we went to some little Italian place that was ok but the great thing about this place is that it is BYOB.  We were drinking Franzia from a box sitting on the table and it was great.  A lively conversation about sex was had by all and then it was off to see Willie Nelson.  Now I love Willie.  He is my Hero and I will do anything for the man but this concert was awful.  Absolutely nothing to do with Willie but the Venue was terrible.  Little girls yelling like it was an En'sync show.  Just awful full of people who didn't care about the concert.  I was pissed and left after 30 min. Then went back to the bar to hang with Kristen and Kathryn.  But it seems that while we were at the concert Kristen saw the 31 year old out with some other girl.  Then she got put on a Rugby players shoulders and had the entire bar yelling at her to show them her tits.  She of course didn't but during that time she had some bitch throw ice at her and yell shit at her.  This pissed her off so when she got of the Rugby players shoulders she went and bought a drink and then proceeded to throw it on her.  This led to her getting molested by one of her large, African friends.  So by the time we met up with them they were not in a good mood to say the least. But we still went to the bar and had a pretty good time..  Kristen got fall down drunk. Which was fun.  Then we went home at cheeseballs and it was off to bed.  Then in the morning we woke up tried to watch the chiefs which we didn't get in Dallas so we left.  I'm sure there were more things that happened.  Details that I left out but that is the gist of it and I'm tired..  I will throw in the advice I gave Paul on Friday night as an appendix.  And maybe a few other thoughts on the weekend.  But for now I'm out.. Peace.

      Coming down and knowing Kristen had plans that she didn't specify and seemed to take some skill going around explaining we automatically new date.  So when we went out Friday night and met this girl Larimie who was pretty cute and definately ready to go home with Paul. (I mean she called him later that night at like 2:30 to see what he was doing).  I encouraged him to bring her home with us.  We would beat Kristen home and he could go in and hook up with Larimie in Kristens room.  So when Kristen came home from her "Date" I could say (with a straight face of course), "You shouldn't go in there Paul's with a girl."  I think that would have made my whole Weekend worth it.  Even the sleeping in the car that would have had to have happened the rest of the weekend. Also I don't know if I put this in the story but Kristen has started to question whether she is going to law school anymore.  NOw I really like Kristen, she is a fun girl but I'm seeing a trend.  Dating a 31 yr old, deciding not to go to law school yet sticking with the fake breasts decision.  Something seems to have gone very wrong down there in the Lonestar State.  Hopefully Kristen will return to us with the same fun and sanity that there normally is in this girl.  I mean doing shit like this sounds a lot more like me than someone fairly rational.  Ohh well  it could definately be a soap opera for everyone to watch.  Thats my 2 cents..  It's late.. I'm tired..  I love you all but I'm out..

      I wish I had more to write.  I feel as though after my novel about last weekend that I have been letting all you kids down by not writing hardly anything.  I have had a wierd hard week.  For example at one point I went 36 hours without sleeping.  Fairly stressful, but we got Fall break starting thursday so that will be nice.  I have to go t Jefferson City for my Grandma's 90th birthday party though so It might be a big waste of time.  Other than that it's late and I need to hit the sack so I can wake up for my 8:30 class tommorrow.  I wish I had something more exciting to tell you guys but I'm trying to keep my life as stress free and interest free as possible.  NOt as easy a task as I would like but I think I am the right man for the job.  Allright everyone take it easy and I'm going to end it with a line sung by the great Pete Townshend, "I hope I die before I get old."  NOt sure why end with that but hey why not.  I'ts my thing I can do what I want.

      Yes thats right, this weekend marks my Grandma's 90th birthday.  The whole Burlbaw Clan met up in Jefferson City this weekend.  It was full of long drawn out stories that go nowhere.  Food that was actually killed by one of my relatives.  Drunken revelry and hours spent hiding from the camera.  All in All it was an interesting weekend.  More and more I realize where I come from when I go to these things.  I think everyone needs to have some kind of large family gathering where there is booze to keep them grounded.  You get an oppertunity to see how crazy you will be in 30 years, and that is good for everyone to keep in mind.  Alright well I'm going to end with me taking a cue from aaron and telling you folks what I'm listening to and watching or basically whatever has captured my interest inthe last five minutes.

      Ok so I haven't updated this thing for a long time.  I have a good reason or at least an excuse.  THe last few weeks have been insane busy.  THere has yet to be a week in which I haven't pulled an all nighter and last week I pulled 3, 2 of them right in a row.  Yes, I didn't sleep wed or thurs night and then I had to go to work fri night so I basically had like 2 hours of sleep from wed till sat about 1:00am...  Thats ok though my body has learned to adjust and I did well in all my classes.  My school is going surprisingly well for how much I miss class and slack.  Hopefully I will pull somewhere around a 3.0-3.5, no gaurantees thoug because there is stil alot of work though.  I got my next semester's schedual pretty mcuh done and hoepfuly it will be very easy aned put me on the road to graduation.  (I know this is the point wher you insert the Tommy Boy quote about Dr.'s going to school for 7 years, but at least I'm not still at Jr. College)  Last week amidst my lack of sleep I hadd the joy of seeing Willie Neslon in Topeka which did surround me with all the grey hairs in town but it was still a hell of a show.  Found a new Wilie song that I love (Me and Paul, funny cuz I lived with Paul last year).  I also have been having and loving life as usual so there is no complaints there.  Just finally learning how to fuck around in school and still do well.   A lesson learned late is better than no lesson at all. Hoepfully there will be more updates about m life more often but if I keep not sleeping like has been the norm lately I can't promise anything.  Peace out homies.

      OK so it has been over a month since I updated this journal of mine and tons of things have happened which I can't hope to recall all of them.  I have gotten drunk and made an ass out of myself.  I have studied.  I have worked.  That is the recap of the month now on to more current things...  Ok we will start with Thursday night.. Thursday night was one for the record books..  I first went to go see  urlLink Ryan Cabrera  play his guitar at the granada because our fraternity put it on.  I have to say it was one of the gayest things I have ever seen in my life and if I could erase it from my memory I would.  I mean imagine a little metrosexual dude from Texas up playing all this cheesy John Mayer type shit..  Yeah it wasn't good.    Well I proceed to get hammered and yell at this dude to play Willie Nelson all night.  He tells me he doesn't know any Willie, So of course I question his manhood because hell he's from Texas and plays guitar and knows no Willie..  He's gotta be gay..  So I end up going and getting completely wasted and playing pool against some people that I don't really remember but I played awful..    So the concert ended at like 10:30 so we go to 815 where one of my buddies is having his birthday..  I proceed to get even more drunk playing Blackjack for fake money and getting a Key Chain and drinking some Rapper drinks (Hypnotic) but of course I was hammered so those 40 proof rapstar drinks aren't good enough for me so I get it mixed with stoli..  Imagine 40 proof liquor mixed with 80 proof liquor and I'm drinking this shit down..  We will just say there is a period of time I don't remember..  I think I called a girl from work and made an ass out of myself..  I'm pretty sure cuz she hasn't called me since..  And of course me being the pussy I am avoids that shit like the plague..  well just say time lapsed for a while here and next thing I know I wake up to Mike23's Girl Rachel drawing a palm tree on my face in permanent marker.  Now I didn't mind so much cuz she is probably the hottest girl I know but eventually it gets annoying so I think I roll of the couch and tackle her..  Then the rest of the night is me being a drunk idiot running around yelling at everybody because I remembered I ordered a pizza and someone brought it to me and I paid for it.. but it was gone..  I finally hunted down the damn freshman who took it and threatened to blackball him and kick his ass..  Then just said fuck it and went to lay down and watch family guy..  Ahh what a night..  Friday night some interesting shit happened too but right now I'm pulling an all nighter so I gotta go to bed..  Peace out all my homies in computer land..

      Last night I did something I never thought I would do, Actually clean my room well with no help from anyone.  I then celebrated by playing flip cup in the basement.  This was a nice start to my drunken evening.  I then went and played some poker and won the money I would then use to go drinking with.  Me and paul go to the Wheel just like a normal night.  I saw a bunch of girls I met at leadershape and hung out and talked to them for most the night.  During that time though I kept drinking double vodka tonics like they were going out of style.  Then jenn and Desiree showed up so I hung out with them and sexually harassed them a little bit.  Then it was closing time so I left and wandered home.  Don't really remember the walk home but I got home.  Then went in the basement and lost like 9 bucks in my drunkeness.  A big mistake.  Then I went up stairs and the anger started getting to me.  Not sure why and at least it was late and I was by myself but I really did get angry.  After seething for a little bit and drinking more.  Maybe I shot of some angry emails not sure it was hazy then I laid down and watched an episode of band of brothers.  Just another night on the town.  Starts off happy and fun and after a large amount of alcohol it ends with me pissed off watching a very touching miniseries..  very odd huh...

      The last week I went to a Leadership conference put on by the school called LeaderShape.  It was a good time where I met lots of people I wouldn't have met anywhere else.  I met one guy, Juan, who was from Bolivia.  One of the funniest guys ever.  I laughed my ass off everytime I was around this kid.  I also met a bunch of other people that were cool and some nice ladies as well.  Did lots of cool stuff and anyone who has the oppertunity to take part in this program I would say to do it.  I know this was probably a boring update but School is just starting so things will start to get wild later.  Peace out kids..

      Ok so far in school I have a 4.0 which is good for me but it hasonlybeen one week. The last week i have been drinking pretty heavily and that is good for me.  Tonight I got drunk and went to a fucking dance club.  It was awful so I left and went to the wheel with some of my buddies.  The wheel is the best bar in all of lawrence and I hung out with a lot of kids I knew there.  I saw girls, guys and whatever.  Then this girl called me and wanted me to come over to where she was partying and then take her home so i was ok with that. I went over there and there were like 10 douchebags there, this girl and me.  It was pretty gay but I figured Icould get some so i was ok.  Then this girl started saying things abouthow I washer bigger brother, Gay.  I tried to work my game and maybe could have done it but would have been a douchebag take advantage of girls guy.  Thats not me so I just left and realized that I should have hung out with the other girls that wanted to hang with me that night.  Ohh well..  I would rather kick it with my boys anytime than hang out with some girl trying to score.  Guaranteed fun against a hope of some kind of play.  I have just realized that I should say screw women and just do my own thing and they will come.  Everytie I'm just at a bar hanging out I meet at least one girl who wants to hook up whether or not I get too drunk to actually do anything aboutit.  But people just rolled in my room so I have to go and hang out with some women..  Peace kids..

      I have been in a wierd mood lately..  I should be in a great mood..  My semester is starting off really well..  I get a nice break from work..  Basicaly just have the time to sit back and live my life without much stress...  Yet I am somehow still unhappy..  My computer's soundboard is messed up so I get no sound out of it..  THis keeps me seperated from Willie, Pat, Hank and all my other boys that help me feel good at times when I start to kinda drop a little..  Ohh well life goes on.. I have found a new obsession..  The Sopranos..  I have watched like 15 episodes in a day.. thats almost 15 hours of Sopranos in a day with out missing any of my 4 classes (one that was 3 hours long)..  I must not have slept at all..  Women piss me off too..  I keep dwelling on all the lies told to me throughout my life by women..  God damn..  NO one can lie quite like a girl.. they have a style and I have a weakness that makes me trust them more than anyone else..  Fucking shit..  This is what gets me pissed but ohh well  I should have known what I was geting into when I started hanging out with any of these girls..  What I need more than anything is night spent with willie, hank, pat, jerry jeff and the rest of my buddies and a nice bottle..  doesn't look like I'm going to be able to get that anytime soon though..  I need to start working out.. burn off some of my anger and start feeling good..  If only it wasn't so god damn cold and icy out maybe I would actually do it..  Ohh well.. theres enough feeling sorry for myself right there..  Ohh yeah Nikki had her kid..  What a crazy life we're living..  Hope everything goes well for that kid.. Kinda scared seeing Nikki as a mom though..  Hope she does a better job with the kid then her mom did with her.. doubtful though..   I'm not a real beleiver in god but if anyone who reads this is that Kid needs all the prayers it can get..  Well I'm off to go finish my bottle of scotch and watch some more Sopranos..  NO class for me tommorrow..    Ed Asner said that "Raising kids is part joy and part guerilla warfare"  I feel that..  It could probably apply to most things in life..  especially women..  I need to go on the war path..  Alright.. I hope this isn't just a bunch of ramblings and maybe it will make someone here smile..  Peace out  kids..

      OK so the last week has been pretty crazy.  Wednesday night me and Toms went to see Hank 3.  Yes, he is the illegitimate child of the illegitimate child of Hank Williams.  He put on a hell of show and rocked the house with some crazy country tunes.  I of course was unreal drunk and was pouring beer down my throat about as fast as I could get my hands on it.  Me and Toms are unreal drunk so we go to meet his Girlfriend at Fatso's where she was supposed to give us a ride home.  She had already left and since it was dollar night and we already paid 2 bucks to get in we decided to sit down and grab a few beers.  After a few more beers and us realizing we could barely stand we figured we should find some way to get home.  I begin calling all kinds of kids in my house and get a ride but just then Whitney shows up with her friend so we are good.  Butsince they came all the way there we figured hell have a few more beers.  So by the time I'm home I am lit up like a torch.  When I get home my roommate is smashed and has this girl he's seeing over so I of course make some crazy comments but since we're all drunk everyone enjoys it and off to bed.    My roomie and I have a 9:30 class on thursday which he is supposed to drive too and since he is the responsible one out of us I put it on him to wake me up. Dumb move..  We miss our class and it turns out afternoon classes for school is cancelled as well so what does my whole house decide to do with this nice break from school?  Catch up on homework maybe..  no..  A Hawaiian party breaks up and our house fills with beer and women and tons of drunks..  so this is 2 nights in a row of being wasted.  I wake up Friday morning bright and early to my alarm but I guess the past two nights have killed some of my much needed brain cells because I couldn't for the life of me remember why I had set my alarm.  So I went back to bed.  My roommate wakes up comes out and sees me asleep on the couch and does the gentlemanly thing by waking me up and saying, Zeke what are you doing don't you have class?  Ohh yeah that's why I woke up so I went off to my full day of class and then back home in pain from my awful hangover.  So I try to take a nap it doesn't work and hey we have a party that night so I get dressed up in the same Hawaiian gear as the night before (It did happen to be a pajama party but who cares Hawaiian Santa is for every occasion)  I forgot to mention that I had been wearing a Santa hat most of this time.  So I go to the party..  get way drunker than I should and head home in a daze still to see what is all going on.  I finally decide to go to bed to get a good nights sleep when I hear a loud noise outside and some knocking on all the doors.  I look out my window and there is like 50 guys on our Lawn.  SO I jump out of bed and wake my roommate up and head out to see what the fight is about.  I pull a bunch of guys in my house off a bunch of other guys and try to get a chance to head back inside so I could recover.  Everyone leaves after 7, that's right 7, cop cars show up to our house.  I head upstairs and spend another hour talking to one of the guys in the other house that I worked with at Waterway about what it was about.  It ended up being a stupid drunk frat penis measuring contest but ohh well..   IN the end a bunch of guys got bruised and bloodied and some other people were pissed about it but none of our guys had a scratch on them so we went to bed happy.  The rest of the weekend was spent in front of the TV, sleeping, Playing poker or reading and now I'm off to bed to prepare myself for the excrutiatingly long day I have tomorrow...  I hope all you kids have had as exciting a weekend as I have and sorry I haven't updated this thing more but I will try to.. just haven't been coherent enough or feeling well enough to do it until now..  Peace..

      I have a lot of shit going on right now.  Very stressed out.  I have a big project where I have to interview a person in a sales field and I'm going to interview Toms' dad but I need to get on it and have been procrastinating.  It's rough to do all this stuff without a car.  I also had a very good night on tuesday and then ended very roughly.  Basically it ended with me sitting at the wheel and Fat Anne Walden talking mad shit on everyone I know.  Screw that bullshit.  I am going to get drinking right now and enjoy this great day as it were.  Then I will finish my weekend which should be great.  I'm going to see OAR and Guster tommorrow night which should be cool but Sunday I'm going to Columbia, MO to attend the Stephen Covey Institute Seminar.  Should be good and help me do well with the rest of the semester.  Well I'm off to enjoy this beautiful day.  I'll get back to all you fools later.  Things will start looking better.

      I have feelings for such girls that don't know about things like my life.  Poetry has nothing to do with the way I feel.  I would write poetry to wrap around myself to cmfert things in my life.  I hear things about my ex girlfirend that I can control the way I feel.  It's embarrising to feel the way I feel.  To know that things are going the way they are with my ex.  I'm happy for her cuz I love her and hope that she is happy.  Yet I meet girls who are beauitful and they distract me from those things.  I am a sad person and just go to class and get a 4.0 and do what I need.  NO love escapes me or engulfs me because ther is no real love around me.  I love mself but that is all there is.  Love as a misson or an escape.  Thas how I am.  Too bad for me and the way I feel.  Tonight is not goood feelings in my soul.  I love life the way it fills me, with life and love and soul, I feel the love around me, I drink it from my bowl, Like a cup of life, it's filled for ever more, I feel the pain around me, I am the man thats full, Life is pain , And life is pleasure, LIfe I can't describe, I hope I live, to see the day, that I will be the scribe

      Ok.. ok.. I'm lazy and my computer is fucked up so there is why I haven't written anything in so long.  Basically tons of stuff has happened like always.  MOstly I got drunk and did stupid shit but one good thing I did was I got a Mohawk last monday.  It is a very interesting thing to have and I like it but will probably get rid of it in a week or two because i have to work and make money.  No one wants a kid with a mohawk waiting tables.  I wasn't drunk when I did it just feeling the pressure of life coming at me and realized I would never be able to do this again probably so why the hell not do it now.  What a great reason huh.  Well I'mm of to go home and eat but I'll try to update this more as things continue on.  Peace, love and all that bullshit...

      Ahh.. life passes so quickly when your young..  Things have been going along pretty well recently..  I have been managing to handle life as it comes which is kind of surprising at times because they get kind of hairy.  I have summer classes all planned out.  I'm moving home for the summer and then maybe for next year.  Trying to get my life under control.  Start working out.  Stop smoking.  Just function like a normal well adjusted human being.  Ohh well.. FInals will be easy.  The semester is almost done.  Just looking for a nice little bit of rest.Hopefully it will come but you know what they say no rest for the weary.  Ohh yeah..  I'm about to buy a Car too so whats up..  Zeke has freedom of movement.  And then on to Formal this friday.  Open bar is such a great thing.  Ohh yeah and Aaron is coming down today so it will hopefully be a good week.   Hope everyone has a nice Cinco de Mayo, "La vida es muy confuso. "

      Ok, on formal me, paul, and Mike, my roomate, were all going to the party.  We all were talking about how we should get some beer for after the party.  But of course no one wanted to have to go get in the car and drive to the liquor store and miss some open bar.  So I said fuck it, open bar would be enough, but Mike kept pushing it.  Of course he didn't want to go and he was being as annoying as he could be.  Then he offered me a 12 pack of whatever beer to go get him a case of bud light.  So i say ok I'll go.  Paul decides to come with me and our dates come along too.  Mike gives us his credit card to use to buy it.  So paul drives down there and we grab the beer and go to the counter.  The guy cards all four of us.  This is when I decided not to use Mike's credit card especially after the clerk made a comment about my name.  I thought i would be stupid for a guy with an unusual name like Ezekiel to then try and use a credit card that had the name Mike on it.  So I just paid cash and figued mike would pay me back.  We go and put the beer in my room because Mike's at the party.  We then go to the party and I loan Mike another 5.00 at the party so he can tip the bartender.  The night continues like usual and no ends up drinking the beer because as I thought we were all too drunk to party afterwards. Fast forward to wednesday night.  I bring up the money Mike owes me and he says he doesn't owe me that much because he said he only asked me to buy him a twelve pack(he said case).  He also said he doesn't have to pay for it because he hasn't drank it yet.  All the beers were in the fridge except for the one he broke and one paul drank.  I continue to get so pissed that eventually I throw a beer all over Mike and leave.  That night I proceded to drink all the beers in the fridge down to his 11 (12 minus the one he broke).  He better pay me my money and he better nefver ask me to loan him anything ever again.  It's bullshit, and it's not like he doesn't have cash.  He just leased a brand new '05 escape and got a $8,000 check for his car.  Can't spare the 30 bucks he said he'd pay me..  bullshit..

      I'm in the library at 3 am doing some silly little project that is fit for a 4 year old.  putting all my papers in a pretty little book so my teacher can look at them.  Awesome.  Makes me want to hit the fuckin'  nit picky bitch in the mouth.  This woman, my TA, is a cute, smiling little ex sorority girl which while good to sleep with is no one you want in charge of your grade.  She doesn't explain things and then hates confrontation.  When asked questions about the assignment she will respond with answers like everyones will be different, there is no wrong way to do this assignment all you have to do is complete it.  So you think awesome, go home and do it and then bring it to her before class and ask, "Is this what you wanted."  and she replies "Yes, Perfect."  Then you get it back and you get a C.  What a dumb bitch.  This is happening to everyone in my class and I want to fucking yell at her and hit her in the goddamn mouth.  I want to hit a bunch of women in the mouth but that is just a common thing with me hating women.  But I restrain myself and am nice to them 90% of the time unless I'm drunk and then I tell them how I really feel about them being fat and worth nothing unless they are on their knees.  God I'm a nice person..  Well I'm off to do some more of this bullshit and scream a little bit about i  Fuck the World

      Wow, I'm getting better at updating this whole blog deal more often.  But enough of the patting myself on the back I'm here to talk about me.   Last weekend we had formal.  I always dread formal because, as those of you who know me know, I hate dressing up.  Not only do I hate dressing up but if I'm not guaranteed to hook up with my date I'm uncomfortable with that.  I mean come one, you take me, tons of booze and then a hot girl in my bed, things could end awkwardly.  But luckily I have always had good experiences with formals so my fears are generally unfounded. Last year I took Claudia who I was very comfortable around and we had fun and things went very well.  The year before that I took Elizabeth Baddely and things went well also.  This year though posed a different situation. I took my friend Kellie from USC.  We're friends and I'm very comfortable with her but there was going to be no hooking up which is scary because the girl is gorgeous and I'm not always the most gentlemanly human being after about 15-20 drinks.  Especially this year we had open bar with all top shelf liquor being included.  I think this was my saving grace.  This and the fact that I was aware of my weaknesses. I went and picked Kellie up from her house around seven and we drove down to the Westin in my moms convertible.  We talked about music and just random stuff.  It was a beautiful day and the drive was very enjoyable, surprisingly so for a drive in the car. We then got there and went up to the room.  Talked to Paul and Maroon about where to eat.  We decided on some Italian joint real near the hotel in Crown Center because it was easy and time saving. After dinner Paul and I and our dates went to go grab some beer at the liquor store and then on to the party.  The party was at Union Station and was awesome.  Free Booze makes almost anything great and this would have been cool anyway.  It was real chill and we hung out and drank and got pretty liquored.  Then it was time to go so me and Kellie started walking home when she decided she wanted to go play in the fountains.  I was ok with that so we went down one of the stairwells to the street.  We had ended up going to the wrong door and couldn't get back in because the door locked behind him. After that things get pretty vague and fuzzy from inebriation but we ended up not making it to the fountains and I remember climbing over some wall.  But we got home and then I had part of a beer and past out. A good time.  The next day I drove Kellie home and went home to take a nap and hang with my sister.   Well that was a long series of events but I still have a little more to say but I'll save that for another time.

      Ok this is exciting for me but I officially own a car now so hopefully money will be flowing in fairly consistantly at this point (because I can now get to work).  It's a beautiful blue-green '94 Honda Accord.  i wish I had a digital camera so I could show a picture of it to you folks but soon I should be adding pictures to this thing which might make things a little more interesting.  But right now I'm off to get some food, a book and then lie to myself about going to work out.  I think it's ok to lie to yourself sometimes as long as you don't start believing yourself.  Ohh yeah I have finals Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday (Whatever).  Ohh another exciting note, I have to get tickets to go to Willie Nelson's Fourth of July Picnic.  It's gonna be great and it's in Fort Worth so if anyone wants to go they should email me or else it will be and maybe my sister and someone from the house.  Well ok I'm off..  Hopefully more exciting things to talk about later.

      I have sudenly realized..  all the drinking I have been doing..  All the girls I have been trying to sleep with.. I think it is all because I feel like I can't find anyone to love me..  Thisis a huge revelation for me and something thaqt I vow to fix during the summer.  This summer I am not going to drink like I have I will diet and work out and become a person that someone will want to love.  It's kind of sad I feel this way but you can't argue with the truth.  This summer will change everything and I will be a different person.  No one will talk to me.  I will be like a butterfly in a cucoon.  The change will happen and then.  I gaurantee you.  I am going to be happy...

      Alright folks I know it's hard to believe but yes it's true, Zeke is on a diet.  I have started on the South Beach Diet and I am going strong.  I have actually lost like 11 pounds over the last week which is a lot, especially because I'm not exercising yet.  I started on Tuesday and I weighed 240 and now I am down to a slim (ok.. slimmer) 229.  I have not drank since Tuesday May 25 and my goal is to keep it that way until July.  Lets just see if I can do it.  This is the first step in my summer plan to become Metro-sexual.  I have set up a totally different blog to track my progress from slovenly drunk to hip, stylish metrosexual so you can follow my progress there, @  urlLink metrosexualmadness.blogspot.com.   Here I will just talk about what's been going on in my life like always.  Oh yeah I'm in the process of finding a new job and it looks like I might end up in the wireless business like Bonomo which would be nice but who knows.  Other than that I'm off.  Oh yeah Paul and I are going to Raul's tonight to play Texas Hold 'em so if you interested there's games at 7:00 and 10:00.  Later...

      Mostly this week has been taken up with not drinking, eating healthy, trying to get a job I enjoy and can make decent money at and just trying to survive.  I of course didn't get the T-Mobile job even though everyone went out of their way for me, having a DUI is just too much.  God damn DUI.  So instead of having a Job I like I don't have a job I like.  I've been looking for more jobs though.  Preferable in sales and not in a restaurant (god I'm sick of restaurants).  So that's the way things are.  School starts tomorrow and at that point I will probably disappear off the planet and this will probably be the only way to get ahold of me.  9 hours in a month.  What was I thinking.    oh but on a lighter side, saw 3 great movies this weekend.  "Love Actually," which was funny and sweet and just good on all sorts of levels.  Would probably have been better if I watched it with a cute girl instead of my parents but it was still good.  I also saw, "Miracle" which was good as any sports movie about underdogs that is done well is good.  And I saw "In America" which was amazing and basically beyond words how good it was.  If you want to know I cried through the whole thing and just was moved by everything in it.  If you can sit through movies without explosions, I know some of you can't (Paul), then you will enjoy this movie.  So I'm off to achieve a few more goals today and see if I can actually succeed at anything without someone dropping the hammer on me.
