       Went to Jenny Craig this morning to get my food and weight in.  I've lost another 1.8lbs!  I am now at  173.4 lbs .  I've lost a total of  11.3 lbs  in  6 weeks .  That's not bad and at a healthy rate.  I finally reached my 10lbs goal and got my pedicure today!  Now, on to my next 10lbs goal for a 1 hour massage.  Next week, time for measurements again!

        06/19/04  started at 184.6 lbs with measurements of:  Bust/Chest: 41.00  Waist: 36.00  Abdomen: 43.00  Hips: 47.00  TTL inc: 167.00     06/26/04  weighed in at: 182.2     07/03/04  weighed in at: 179.0     07/10/04  weighed in at: 178.8 with measurments of:  Bust/Chest: 41.00  Waist: 35.50  Abdomen: 39.25  Hips: 45.00  TTL inc: 165.75   TTL Inc Lost: 6.25      07/17/04  weighed in at: 176.4     07/24/04  weighed in at: 175.2      I've lost  9.5 lbs  and  6.25 inc  in 5 weeks! I can already start to tell that my clothes are feeling a little bit big. I'm holding out until I get to my ideal weight, between 130-150 (depending on what I think I would look good at) to buy new clothes. I might have to head to the thrift store in the mean time. :)     My  10 lbs  goal reward is to have a pedicure. I thought last week that I might reach it but I was .5 lbs off sor I'm sure that I'll reach 10 lbs this Saturday!     My next 10 lbs goal reward is to have a massage. I do try to reward myself with something small (no more than $20.00) a week. It helps keep me motivated to get up out of the bed in the morning and get to the gym.     I've been feeling more awake and feel like I have more energy. I'm in a better mood pretty much all the time. I also feel that my blood pressure has gone down. I have no way of knowing for sure becuase I don't check on a regular basis. That should be one of my goals. Get a blood pressure machine for home. Especially since some of my family does have high blood pressure.    I've gotten a few compliments where people have noticed that I've lost some weight.  That always feels good! :)     This is my normal exercise program.  I do vary from it on time to time depending on how I'm feeling or just for change.     Sunday : usually my r&r day.  Maybe some laundry.     Monday : Gym (45 minutes, cardio & weights), 6 flights of stairs (up &amp; down at least once a day) and karate (at least 2 times a week)     Tuesday : Gym (45 minutes, cardio & weights), 6 flights of stairs (up &amp; down at least once a day) and karate (at least 2 times a week)     Wednesday : Gym (45 minutes, cardio & weights), 6 flights of stairs (up &amp; down at least once a day) and karate (at least 2 times a week)     Thursday : Gym (45 minutes, cardio & weights), 6 flights of stairs (up &amp; down at least once a day) and karate (at least 2 times a week)     Friday : No gym (day off), 6 flights of stairs (up & down at least once a day)     Saturday : Errands (including walking at the mall, walk to the library, video store, etc.)    I'm feeling more fit by the day!    Now off to Karate!

          I'm home sick today trying to keep myself awake for a few hours so that I don't have another sleepless and restless night....    I decided to check a friend’s blog out on another site.  Probably a mistake as you can tell by my previous posts, but it is interesting to see what the quizzes have to say.  Of course they are not all true but some are fairly close.    Just something to keep myself busy for a while until I go plop back down on the bed and rest.

         You have a heartsick soul! Youre the type of girl who always has a crush and is writing their name on all your books. You are a hopeless romantic. Waiting for that prince charming, you take love seriously, but still play any chance you get. You can have a lot if boys who are friends, but waiting for that perfect boyfriend. Sometimes you are discouraged because there are no sparks but even if the smallest thing happens, youre on Cloud 9.  You believe in true love and wait for it. Just dont be afraid to take a chance.

         Your sex with Legolas would be more like making love. Sweet and tender, romantic and loving...  Probably occuring in the forest of Lothlorien or Mirkwood under a star studded sky, it would be long, slow and sweet, most likely with Legolas gently whispering beautiful Elvish poetry in your ear.

         You are Long-wang!    Mythological Background: Yes, the dragon represents everything you think of when you think of a dragon - fearsome and invincible. Also, it is greatly respected just because of that fact. The dragon has a very protective aspect to it. Even Jupiter reminds you of intense smashing power. The dragon is almost always surrounded by rain-bearing clouds and fog; and the appearance of its constellation always signals rainfall and lightning. It's also a symbol of authority worn by the nobility and the imperial class.

       The pronunciation   for Emer.  Took me a while, but I think this should sum it up.      EMER     f    Usage:  Irish, Irish Mythology     Pronounced:  EE-mur   Possibly from Gaelic  eimh  "swift". In Irish legend she was the wife of Cuchulainn. She was said to possess the six gifts of womanhood: beauty, voice, speech, needlework, wisdom and chastity.

          I've thought many times what my life would have been like if I was rich and didn't have a bill to worry about.  Countless dreams.   Unfortunately, I probably will never know what that is like.  Like most people I am doomed to work weather I like it or not.  But, I do have a choice as to what I do for my job.  Now, that I do have a say so in liking or not.    In the past few weeks, on countless occasions, I have almost packed my stuff up and left my current employer.   I knew that was not the right thing to do.  Well, since then I've been looking for a new job.  No luck yet.  I've gone on a couple of interview but nothing that just says "take me, I'm the one that will be worth wile".  So I continue to look.    I had a job interview today after work.  The job sounds like it would be good but it is more of a sales position and I'm not so sure that I can do sales.  I don't like forcing something on someone when they don't want it.  I guess that's because I'm that way.  Someone tries to sell me something that I'm not interested in I get aggravated at him or her.  I already have enough stress as it is now that I don't need more.    In the mean time.   Todd and I are planning a trip to Portland, OR in September.  We just want to get away and see different places.  We are both tired of Dallas and hope to one-day move out of the state to a place that we both know we will enjoy.  So we are doing some exploring.      Why Portland?  Well, several things that we like about it is that the temperature is better there, the pollution level is better, it’s close to the ocean and other states with lots of attractions, as well as it has a nice public transportation system.  Since Todd no longer has a car and I am working towards that, it is a good thing to have public transportation rapidly accessible for a decent price.    This is just one of the places we are touring.  I'm sure that when we get around to it and have the money we will explore other possibilities, but right now this one has intrigued our interests.  Another big issue that we both have is having our bills paid off when we do finally more.  That way we won't have to worry about finding a well paying job right off and can enjoy just getting to know the new place without a lot of stress.      Emer update:  I've been asked how to pronounce this new handle.  I haven't had any luck on finding that.  More research and an answer as soon as I get the correct one.     On another note, I am going to add a Jenny Craig Weight Loss Journal on this one.  It should be up and running in a day or two.   You should be able to go to "view my complete profile" and at the bottom it will have a list of the blog's that I write in.  Just click on it that way to read it.  I'm going to look at getting it on my main page of this one but I'll have to see if Todd can handle that for me.

       I've been looking for a name that I could use. I came up with this one. Here is what it means and a little story about it. Not all of it rings true about me, but well enough. It's an Irish (Celtic) name and me being Irish (Italian, Indian, and who know what else), it'll do just fine.    Emer  An exceptionally beautiful, and intelligent, woman who knew it! Before she would allow the hero Cuchulainn to sleep with her she demanded a number of heroic tasks be successfully completed, reasoning that her superior endowments warranted it.     And here is the story.  No finished but still a good read.        The Wooing of Emer    Cuchulainn,   one of Ireland's greatest warriors, grew up at the court of Conor MacNessa in Emain Macha near Armagh. Conor was a powerful and well-loved king. His hospitality was well-known. There were always celebrations and feasts going on.  One night the chiefs of the Red branch had gathered in Conor's great banquet hall for a feast. They were drinking from a huge vat of wine which kept them satisfied all evening. Conall Cearnach, Fergus Mac Roi, Laoghaire, Dubhtach, Scet, all the greatest Ulster warriors were there, including the youngest, Cuchulainn. They took turns displaying their fighting skills between two ropes stretched from wall to wall. As usual, Cuchulainn outshined them all. The women of Conor's household loved to watch him do his Chariot feats. He was swift, agile, and well built; he was wise and kind; he spoke sweetly to them and was the handsomest of all men. He was prudent, unless the battle frenzy came over him. He was a good chess player and a good judge. He had all these gifts as well as the gift of foresight.    The others became jealous of Cuchulainn because he was too young, too daring, too handsome, and, most of all, too popular with the women. They figured that, if he had a wife, their wives and daughters would pay less attention to him. Besides, since it was foretold that his life would be heroic and short, it would be better that he marry soon and have a son as soon as possible.       So it was decided.   Conor sent nine men into each province to look for the daughter of a king or chief who would make a worthy wife for Cuchulainn. One year later the messengers returned, and not one of them had found a girl who Cuchulainn would marry. Cuchulainn decided to take the matter into his own hands. He and his charioteer, Laeg Mac Riangabra took off to a place called the Gardens of Lugh to visit a girl Cuchulainn knew. They were going to visit Emer, the daughter of Forgall the Wily. She was the most beautiful and intelligent woman in all of Ireland.    When they arrived, Emer was sitting on the green in front of her father's rath, surrounded by the daughters of the local landowners. She was teaching the young women embroidery when she heard the drumming of hoofs, the rattle of weapons, and the clanging of metal. Sounds of a chariot in the distance approaching at full tilt.    Emer asked her sister, Fial, to see who was coming here at that reckless speed. Fial ran to the road and yelled to Emer, "I see two fine, lively horses; A black and a gray. Yoked to a high wooden chariot with wicker-work sides. Inside the chariot there is a dark, melancholy man, the handsomest in Ireland and next to him a red-haired charioteer."    Seconds later, Laeg pulled horses to a halt and Cuchulainn sprang out of the chariot. Emer lifted her face to see the visitor and saw that it was Cuchulainn. She greeted him and asked him why he was there.       Cuchulainn did not give her a straight reply.  He answered her with a riddle only she could understand because he did not want the other young women to know what he was up to. Emer realized that Cuchulainn had come to court her and since she both loved and admired him, she was pleased.    Cuchulainn told her how and where he was raised and then asked Emer, "How were you brought up?" Emer replied, "I was brought up to respect the old values. I am well behaved and modest, graceful and beautiful and equal in rank to a queen. I am the most praised and admired woman in Ireland."    `We seem well matched then," replied Cuchulainn, "Why don't we join together?" But Emer wasn't going to let him off that easily. `One last question," said Emer. "Have you got a wife already?" "No!," he quickly answered. "You're the only woman I love."      Cuchulainn looked down at Emer's chest and said softly, "I see a sweet place, a sweet resting place."      "No one rests there until he has killed a hundred men at each ford from the Ford of Scemen to Banchuin," replied Emer.      "I see a sweet resting place," Cuchulainn repeated.    "No one rests there until he has slain a group of three times nine men while leaving the man in the middle of each group alive," Emer told him.      "I will rest in that sweet place."      "No one will rest there who does not stay awake from February to May and from May to November."      "I'll do everything you've asked," Cuchulainn promised.      "If you do, then we'll join together and be like one," promised Emer.      Cuchulainn then said farewell, and he and Laeg returned to Emain Macha.       That evening,  the young girls told their families about the handsome stranger and how he and Emer had spoken in riddles. The next day the girls' fathers went to Forgall and told him what had happened the day before. Forgall knew it could be no one else but Cuchulainn. While most of the men of Erin would be happy for Cuchulainn to marry their daughter, Forgall hated Cuchulainn and forbid any such marriage to take place.    Forgall and two friends went to Emain Macha disguised as messengers from the king of the Gauls bringing tributes of wine and gold to Conor Mac Nessa. There was the usual entertainment and display of fighting skills. Conor praised his champions and spoke of their bravery. Forgall agreed they were all great champions, especially Cuchulainn, but he told Conor that they could be even better.    He told Conor they should train with Donall the Destroyer in Scotland, and when he has taught them everything he knows, they can go further west to the Isle of Skye, where Scathach the Shadowy One lives. She can train them in the special fighting skills she has learnt, and reveal to them secrets of war and weaponry that only she knows.    When they heard this, Conor, Conall, Laoghaire, and Cuchulainn decided to go to Scotland. Forgall was pleased. He hoped that Cuchulainn would get involved in one of Scathach's wars and be killed in battle.    Before leaving for Scotland, Cuchulainn secretly went to tell Emer where he was going. Emer warned him that those were not Gaulish messengers, but her father in disguise. Cuchulainn thanked Emer and told her he would be careful.        [To be Continued]

       My man and I have been on Jenny Craig for about a month and a half (a little longer for him).  So far I'be been very please with my results.  Lost 8.8 lbs and a total of 5 3/4 inches in a month and the food isn't all that bad.  Just wish they had a little more of a selection.   I seem to be feeling a little more entergetic except the last few days I haven't been feeling all that well.  My over all mood seems to be better, except when someone pisses me off.  :)    One thing I am a little ticked about is last week we were jipped a breakfast meal.  No problem, we got a free one.  Yesterday I find out that I was jipped a dinner and then today while I was packing my food for tomorrow I find out that I was jipped another breakfast meal.  My god!  How hard is it to make sure that all the food is there, especially when I'm calling the items out to you and you are putting them in a sack!      That's all I have to say about that.....

       Well, that is exactly what it is, hunting.  There is on easy way to do it but grab a paper and start faxing/e-mailing my resume out to anything and everything that I "think" or I "know" I am qualified for and *hope* that I'll get a call or some type of response back.     I am still currently employed but I can't stand the people at my office anymore and I'm just getting sick and tired of being treated like a 2 year old.     I walked to the Plano Municipal Court building today, which if you now where I live, it's far at all.  I filled out an application and then took a spelling test and a typing test.  I was really surprised to see that I only missed like 2-4 words and my typing was 65 wpm with 99% accuracy.  Go me! :)  I thought that I was more like 40-50 wpm and I had no idea what my accuracy level was.  The spelling was pretty easy.  And for me that's saying alot because god knows that I am not the best speller at all.  Oh well.  I'm hoping to get that job.  It would be perfect but I am also trying not to get my hopes up.    On another note, I am enjoying my day off.  Eventhough I am doing some hunting it is still relaxing not having to worry about someone yelling at me for quite possibly someone else's mistakes.

       I started going to karate again last night after almost a year off.  I really do enjoy it.  I should have been going ever since last fall but I just didn't have the money.  Now I have to pretty much still start all over.  I just consider it a refresher, and besides I get to keep my stripe I earned last fall.  :)  At least I'm not the smallest fish in the sea now.  I think that Karate will help me get more focused and improve me mentally and physically.  I'm looking forward to it.  With doing the Jenny Craig diet and already exercising 45+ minutes at least 4 times a week, a little more exercise won't hurt. :)  I'll be a foxy lady in no time flat!  Watch out!

       I work at an auto insurance company and I dispatch people to go look at wrecked vehicles.  One particular assignment required two different appraisal requests.  A long story short, I sent an appraisal assignment to someone and asked them to do both the tractor and the trailer.  I have no idea once I've sent the assignment whether or not if they did as I asked.  Well, the second request for the other half of the vehicle came through and my co-worker got it.  She asked the adjuster for a phone number by e-mail then was off to an all day class.  The e-mail the came to me since she was gone, and I naturally assigned it to the company that did the previous assignment for us since I had asked them to do both assignments.  (Assuming that they did.)  Well, my co-worker found out and started giving me hell and being rude to me.  "Why did you do that", "I wanted it to go to "so and so", etc.  I explained it to her from my point of view and why I had done it that way.  She didn't agree with me, gave me a go to hell look, and then walked away to go back to here class.   My point of all this is, if I do something there is usually a reason to why I did it.  If you don't like it or have a question about it then ask.  Don't be fucking rude to me (as if I am stupid and don't know what I'm doing). I am simply doing my job and making my own decisions.  Just because you don't like the conclusion that I came to when I was given the work doesn't give you the right to bad mouth me or be rude.  You should have done it yourself if you wanted it done in a way that I might not have done it.

       I didn't really want to get up this morning to head to the gym but I did.  Once I got there and started working out it felt good.  Then I started thinking about the 6.2 lbs and 5 3/4 inches that I've lost in a month and I got really motivated but dealing with some of the people at the gym just pisses me off. In particular the women in the locker room.  They are so disgusting.  Hair all over the place, tampax and pads on the floor in the shower stalls. Were these people grown in a fucking barn??  Obviously!  On top of that I head the front desk call for the cleaning lady four times.  4 times!  Come to find out, she was in the supply closet asleep.  Lazy bitch!  Once I get to work I'm feeling a little bit better but still pissed off at the world. Stupid drivers!  I've been taking the stairs rather than the elevator.  Mind you, this is 6 flights of stairs.  By the time I get to 4 1/2 I feel like I'm about to die but I push myself and make it to 6 huffing and puffing the whole way.  But then I think back again at my whole progress and I'm very happy that I'm started working out and eating right.  Now, if I could just be in a better mood and less stressed all the time maybe I could get my blood pressure down!

       Why can't I just stay home all the time and do absolutely NOTHING.  That would be Grrreeeeaaattt! (As said by Tony the Tiger)  I guess I do have bills to pay but who the hell cares about them?  I don't want to live on the street so I guess I do a little.  On a different note.  My lover :) and I have been doing Jenny Craig and exercising for the last 3 weeks for me and 4 for him.  We've both done very well.  He's lost 10 lbs and 5 1/2 inches and I've lost 6.2 lbs and 5 3/4 inches.  Go me! :)  I hate dieting but I know this is going to help with understanding what portion size I should have and over all just my general health and exercise.    *Dreaming* I'm in a sexy thong two piece bathing suit.  Damn! I look hot!  Well, time to go make my breakfast.  I'm sure their will be more of this rambling on later.

       I was looking through some other people's Blog's I came across one that I thought would be interesting to see what would turn out.  Needless to say I am supposed to marry Brad Pitt.  Funny thing is that when I was in HS, freshman year, my English teacher actually admitted that she had babysat Brad Pitt.  I've never really thought about marrying an actor and I'm not even sure that given the chance I would.  It just seems like most relationships that are powered by fame, fortune and business never last.  That's why I am happy where I'm at now.  I have a geeky, nerdy, lovable sweetheart of a guy who treat me right and I never have to worry about the press!     You are going to marry Brad Pitt. He is always friendly to anybody he ever meets and he is very talented as an actor. He is also very sincere and friendly. He will respect you until the day he dies. Congruity!!    urlLink   Which male celebrity are you going to marry? (14 choices now!!)     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

       This is my first time doing any type of posting.  I've written in a journal before but never lasted so we will see how well I keep this up.    Most of the stuff that I put on here will probably be stupid, misspelled, incorrect grammar or just totally wrong.  I don't expect anyone reading to really care and if you do and you have a problem with it, screw off.   I like to talk about people so, well, there will be some of that.  If you don't want to get talked about then don't do whatever the hell it is that you are doing to make me annoyed by you.    I hate stupid people.  Not in the sense of they don't know how to read or write. I never said that I was a genius of any sorts.  People that intentionally try to piss someone off, or anyone, no matter the age, acting like a fucking 4 year old.  Now that's something that I just can't stand.  Grow up people!   Act your fucking age and stop pissing on my sunshine.

       Okay, I have decided to switch to a new journal.  To get to the new one just follow these steps.  If you have any questions you can always e-mail me or post a comment on this journal until I have this one canceled which probably won't be for a few weeks to give everyone time to swtich their bookmarks.  Follow these steps to read the new journal:   1. http://www.livejournal.com  2. Do a search for:  emer_cuchulainn  under "username" then click on the "search" button.  3. This page is the one that you would want to bookmark.  This is considered my "main page".  This journal is open to the public so you shouldn't have to sign up to read it but if you want to post to it you might have to.  It is free to sign up and you don't have to use it at all if you don't want to.  You can use it simply to post comments if you like.  4. Now to read what I have written simply click on my name that is bolded:  emer_cuchulainn   5. This will open up my journal.  You can then leave "comments".  If you are required to set up a free acount to do this you can e-mail me and I'll give you the directions on how to add me to your "friends" list so that all you have to do is login under your username to be able to read my journal.  It's really simple.  6. Once you are done you can close your window or if you can read my Weight Loss Journal.  To do this you can access my Weight Loss Journal (gmweightloss) from the menu to the left if you are still in the same area you were when you were reading my entries.  Simply click on "User Info" and it will take you back to my main page.  From the main page you can access the journal two different ways.  First, in my "Bio" you can click on the link labeled " My Weight Loss Journal ".  This will take you directly to that page.  The set up is a little different right now.  When I have time I will updat it.    Or second, from my main page, scroll to the bottom and under "Also Friends of:" you can click on "gmweightloss".  This will take you to the main page of my Weigh Loss Journal.  From there you would click on "gmweighloss" at the top.  Then you can read the journal.  The first way might be easier but whatever you can manage.  Once I get gmweightloss all fixed it will be easier to navigate between the two from my "User Info" page on either journal.  This is a little more "spiffy" than the current one that I am using and I do like the options better on the new one.  On the new journal, anything that is in blue can be clicked on to read someone else's journal or a community that I have marked to read.  I'll have different pictures that I'll use from time to time and probably update the layout a bit on occasion.  Just more options for me.

       Well, let me just update what has happened to me.  First, I talked to my brother, Dustin.  We don't talk all that much and up till about a year ago we hadn't talked in about 5 years.  I went and saw him graduate from High School.  Well, he is planning on driving up from Conroe, TX this Friday to spend the night or two to hang out with me.  I'm so excite, I just don't know what to do with him.  I guess I'll figure it out once he gets here. :)  Second, I called and talked to my Aunt, Celeste today at lunch.  We talked for a few minutes.  It was nice.  I usually don't talk on the phone much but I enjoyed it.  My Uncle James was asleep.  His loss!! LOL  Just kidding.  I told Celeste what was happening with Dustin.  She thought it was great and will try to have Uncle James call sometime on Saturday to talk to Dustin too.  Okay, here is the kicker.  Right after I got off the phone with Aunt Celeste I cleaned up my lunch and started to head back to my desk.  Let me just insert a comment here.  About 2 or 3 weeks a go I noticed a new girl on my floor.  I asked a couple of people her name.  Sandra Williams.  She looked really familiar to me.  So, finally today, on my way back to my desk, I asked her who she was.  She told me.  And I asked if she knew a Holly Taylor or Holly McKnight.  She did!  I told her that I was her daughter and she immediately knew my name!  How freeking weird!  We talked for a few minutes and she told me that she is now married and has been for about 8-10 years.  Her name used to be Sandra "Sandy" Johnson.  She told me that I used to talk to her now husband, then boyfriend about running.  I don't even remember ever liking running but I must have.  Talk about a week of weird events.  Working for this company has changed things in my life.  First, Brandi and I started talking again after 3 years of not doing so.  We used to work together at another company, got to be really good friends and roomies, and then things fell apart.  Now they are all good.  Second, now I meet Sandra again.  Whew!  I just don't know what to think about all this now....

       In my LJ (Live Journal) I've joined a community for Medieval Times.  I thought it would be interesting to see what is said and possibly learn more about the medieval times.  I've always been interested in that time but never knew where to start to learn.  Well, one of the people who also is a member of the same community suggested starting a book reading once a month.  I think that is a good idea and it will help me learn more.  I wasn't sure where to start or what to even look for before now.  This person, I think it is a she, suggested that we start with  The Mabinogion .  So, I reserved two different copies from my public library.  I was reading another novel of Anne Rice but this one isn't so interesting to me.  I figured I would give the book reading a try and if I didn't like it then I could try the next book they suggest.  We are supposed to post comments starting on September 1 or when we finish the listed reading.  We will see how that goes.  I'm not sure what is to be posted.  Maybe just an overview of the selection but I guess I will see.  It's supposed to be more of a discussion board or something.  Wish me luck.  :)

       Okay.  I haven't written in a while here.  I've been trying out this now online journal  thing called Live Journal.  www.livejournal.com  Do a search (top right corner) for my  username : emer_cuchulainn, then when my page comes up just click on my name that is bolded where is says  user: emer_cuchulain  and you should be able to read what all I've written there too.  I haven't completely switched over yet because I don't know how and if I can set up a second journal strictly for my Weight Loss or not and I don't want to mix the two.  I have the LJ (Live Journal) set where everyone can read it so there should be no problem.  If there is let me know and I'll see what I can do.  For right now I am using both journals.  So you might to have both of them bookmarked.  When and if I finally switch the two over I'll let you know.

       Okay. To sum up the even. Todd clogged the toilet last night. How you ask? Good question. All I remember at about 7:00 am this morning is him saying the toilet is clogged and you are going to be mad at me. Why? Well, he poured excess candle wax down it.  Okay, well, I tell him to call it in to the office to get it fixed since he tried everything to fix it himself. I ended up calling it in around 10:00 am or so. "Oh sure! We can get that fix for you no problem today!"  Okay, 6:00 pm I arrive home. Run to the bathroom, as I always do once I get home, and low and behold the toilet IS NOT FIXED! Well, the office closes at 6:00 pm. Somehow I got tied up with something else and at about 8:00 pm Todd calls. I told him that the toilet was not fixed. So, resorted to call in an emergency maintenance request. I call, and call, and call some more. Come to find out, the office did not put the answering service/voice mail on so I could not make the request. Talk about being aggravated. It's 9:30 pm here and there is still no working toiled in my one bedroom/one bathroom loft and still no way to get emergency maintenance out.  I had to go drop rent off so I wrote a nice little thank you to them on the envelope. I mean, what if I had to take a shit? I guess I could bad it up and drop it at their front door but that might be going a little too far.   Current Mood:  aggravated

       Do the self-esteem well.   I wasn't in the mood to go work out this morning but I got my ass out of the bed and went.  Dreading it all the way.  It is funny how I don't want to go but once I get there I enjoy it.  It wakes me up and seems to start my day.  Very refreshing.  While I was upstairs working out my lower body, a guy that I have never talked to before but seen for the last several months there, gave me a compliment.  He said, "You are doing well with your workouts."  I didn't think much about it and said "thank you" and smiled.  I introduced myself and found out his name is Justin.  We have never talked before today and that was all that was said.  There is just something about someone you don't know giving you a compliment.   It brightened my day! :)

          Had a long weekend.  Not all pleasure.  Was out sick on Wednesday, missed 1/2 a day on Thursday and all day Friday.   Should be glad that I had such a long weekend but when you aren't feeling good, it doesn't feel all that long.  Started feeling better on Saturday so I went to a Frisco Rough Riders (minor league baseball) game.  It was nice.  We lost though.  Oh well.  I got out of the house a bit.  Watched two movies today and did laundry.  Yeah, I know, quite fun.  I enjoyed just lounging around.  Did end up running a few errands so I was out of the house for a little while.   I received a letter in the mail from my school.  It stated that they could no longer offer Leisure Piano, which is one class that I was planning on taking this fall.  Well, that totally messed my schedule up.  The other piano class that they are offering I can't take.  The class starts too early and I would have to leave early work two days a week.  That won't fly with my boss.  So I completely change my schedule.  Not that I was taking anything hard.  Mainly fun classes because I have no idea what I want to do for a living.  Still.  I was signed up to take: M&W Yoga W Piano Sat Walking &amp; Fitness  Now my schedule is: M&W Classical Guitar Sat Walking &amp; Fitness  When I was in 8th and 9th grade I played the saxophone.  I was about 2+ years behind everyone else learning because I started so late, which was not my fault, so eventually I got frustrated and gave it up.  I know that I could have continued but I didn't have the money for private lessons and my band director basically told me that I sucked (in so many words).  I've always been interested in learning the piano or even guitar.  Well, since I can't take piano I've decided to try guitar.  I went out and bought me a decent but cheap classical guitar to learn on.  My goal is to stick with it two semesters (1 year) and if I just don't like it after that then I'll sell the guitar and try something different.   And since I have no idea what I want to go to school for, well, this won't hurt to try.  I've almost finished the book I am currently reading, The Vampire Armand by Anne Rice.  My next novel, which I found out today that I should have read this one first, is going to be Pandora also by Anne Rice.  I haven't been in to reading much in my life until I met Todd and even for the first few months we were together I refused to pick up a book.  Since I've started I've noticed that I am sleeping better and actually enjoy reading.   I don't know many authors but I do like the way Ann Rice writes.
