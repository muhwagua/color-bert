       Meet me at the place for the thing.   One of the last century's most important philosophers, either  urlLink Theodor Adorno  or  urlLink Ian Svenonius , comments that the logic of late capitalism has led to the reification and subsequent fetishization of culture, and thence to a seemingly inevitable traffic in "cultural products".  This, Ted 'n' Ian go on to tell us, gave rise in the earlier part of the twentieth century to what has now become a barrage of fads, trends, and " urlLink the next big thing ".  The supposed "democratization" of culture, rather than opening the doors of art to the masses, has instead led to a situation in which entrepreneurs deal in music, literature, and the graphic and performing arts in a manner essentially indistinguishable from the trade in a commodity like petroleum or iron.  The record industry, in its ceaseless rush to supply the public demand for product, therefore mines the bars and nightclubs of the postindustrial West, and to a lesser extent  urlLink even farther afield , for an untapped vein it can present as the hot new thing or a reasonable facsimile thereof.  While the nature of the production of cultural goods means that the "artist" is necessarily complicit in at least a part of this process, and while this complicity often creates deep psychological conflicts for many producers of musical commodity, this is not the purview of this post.  Rather we concern ourselves here with discussing a mechanism for preventing the reification of musical culture.  Naturally, considering both the nature of the system in which we find ourselves and the human nature which has led to that system, we cannot hope to force the culture industry to suddenly surrender and reconfigure itself on a noncapitalist basis.  The way in which independent rock has typically dealt with this problem is to recede into a notional " urlLink underground " where presumably they are freer to act as  urlLink artists  rather than artisans.  This strategy is not watertight, as every once in a while a wave of artists from this so-called "underground" forsake it for the lure of wider acceptance, in the process giving the industry a new point of entry and a new spectrum of styles, stances, and  urlLink attitudes to market .  Nonetheless, in periods when the "underground" is allowed some measure of autonomous functioning, it serves as fertile ground for the interchange and development of ideas.  Adorno would argue that in promoting this kind of arrangement for what is essentially a popular art form, rock and roll to be explicit, we are falling victim to the kind of false connoisseurship that plagued popular jazz records in the forties and fifties, and overvaluing a process which is less creative than reproductive;  Adorno however was a fucking snob who thought jazz was inherently fascist.  In reality there is nothing more or less valid about a truly powerful work of rock and roll than a fucking kickass classical composition.  Naturally there are pitfalls:  just as classical music has its "fans" who participate willingly in the Cult of the Conductor, thereby fetishizing something essentially peripheral to the music, so does underground rock and roll have the obsessive collector, who MUST HAVE every  urlLink Sarah Records  7", not to listen to them mind you, but just to  have .  These are, like the collective behavior of the culture industry, merely acts of commodity fetishism not, as Adorno claims, more germane to any genre of music than any other, but instead growing out of a modern consumerist mentality into which all individuals in our society are liable to slip.  By "going underground", groups can attempt to escape the conversion of their popular art, which is something that is created and disseminated among people, into mass culture, which is created and perpetuated onto people by an artificial apparatus.  Part of the very attraction of independent music for its practicioners and fans is this element of disconnection from the culture at large, which is practically the sole purview of the culture industry.  The nature of the underground is to be fragmentary and disjointed.  Music is created and disseminated by groups and individuals who are committed to principles other than the saturation of the market with product, and therefore their reach is short and weak.  This means that within the supposedly unitary "underground" there are many different currents running simultaneously, often with absolutely no connection to one another.  This is why it is possible, at a good time, to keep finding new things worth hearing, as long as one makes the effort.  One salutary effect of this disjunction is the limitation it places on the ability of one style or attitude to monopolize the cultural space we have carved out for ourselves.  That is to say, more opportunities to say "your favorite band sucks and here's why" than can be found in the mainstream, where quality is quantified on the Billboard charts and there is no choice other than the one between "Rock" or "R&B".   I am fully fucking aware of the irony of making this claim in a bit about a subculture that's already made that very same choice;  think of it this way - the mainstream doesn't divide Rock down any farther.  Oh, sure, maybe it grades its rock by hardness or heaviness, but ultimately what the market does is select for the most reliably homogeneous body of music it can - what's unusual is risky, and risks don't sell.  This is why so-called "musical revolutions" in mass culture inevitably begin with a single leftfield success, blossom with the cooperation of the single leftfield success's friends, and result, sometimes as little as a year after the fact, in nothing more than a new chart hegemon.  If this were not the case, Nirvana, rather than killing off cock rock, would have coexisted alongside it;  we might even have been spared Candlebox.  However, as music (in the form of the "single" and the "album") and to a near-equal extent attitude are the commodity products of the music industry, it is in their interest to homogenize those products with respect to another as much as possible.  Quality is not as important as reliability.  Underground music, from hardcore punk rock to hip-hop, has no charts, and therefore no chart hegemons.  The indie press has its darlings from week to week or month to month, but the saturation of independent media is so weak, and the fragmentation of taste so profound, that even while we may get sick of fucking Joan of Arc already, you can bet that there's still someone out there, no less "punk" than you you little snob, who's just getting into them for the first time, and furthermore is probably able to dismiss your newfound appreciation for Los Crudos as too little too late (that fucking snob).  That's not to say that underground rock is free of the impulse to create a canon.  From time to time books like   urlLink Our Band Could Be Your Life   come along and attempt to enshrine a certain band or group of bands over the rest;  certain influences pop up again and again in interviews in zines.  However thanks to the weaker grip that underground musical culture has over its adherents, that canon is bound to be reorganized constantly as kids go back and revive the memories of bands and movements who have otherwise left no lasting trace.  It's a far cry from the mainstream media with its endless Beatles-Stones-Led Zep Beatles-Stones-Led Zep Beatles-Stones-Led Zep-oh-yeah-and-those-Sex-Pistol-dudes.  The absence of a canon and a powerful unitary organ of taste dissemination like MTV or Rolling Stone or Spin means that discovery of  urlLink new sounds  and scenes within the underground is largely up to the individual.  These musics must be actively sought out by the interested, and for that reason underground rock and roll acquires the character of a secret club whose members identify each other with specialized markings;  with a little effort you can always find out where the people who hated high school as much as you did are hanging out.  You don't have anything in common with the guy or girl at the bus stop, but you can probably start a fucking band with the guy or girl at the bus stop wearing a pin of your  urlLink ABSOLUTE FAVORITEST BAND EVER HOLY SHIT WHERE'D YOU GET THAT ?  It's an instant community you just can't share with someone who's only wearing the same shoes as you.  Unless of course those shoes are Sauconies or black Chuck Taylors, or the holy grail:   urlLink Vision Street Wear .  This in a nutshell is why I love punk rock.  And why I fucking hate the fucking  urlLink Strokes .

       The La Bamba's Road Trip Cult.   Several years ago, probably about seven, I was walking around the Library Mall on the UW-Madison campus late one Friday night with a few friends when we were approached by a group of three people looking for the  urlLink La Bamba's .  When we explained to them (two guys and a girl, all dressed in a fairly collegiate manner) where it was, they explained, without being prompted, that they were students at Purdue, and that one of "the things to do" there was to take roadtrips out to eat at all of the various far-flung La Bamba's locations.  I've repeated this story to many people over the years, and their responses have ranged from bemusement to dismissal.  Since coming to Indiana, I have realized that for the most part, someone living in West Lafayette would not have too much trouble getting to at least five other La Bamba's locations in road trips of less than two and a half hours:  Muncie, Indianapolis (they have three), and Bloomington.  There are in fact seven La Bamba's in Indiana, compared with nine in Illinois, many of which are within striking distance of Purdue;  four in Wisconsin, and one each in Ohio and Kentucky.   At any rate, the idea that a group of bored Purdue students would take a drive of such a manageable length in order to gain the dual benefits of the camaraderie of the road and greazy-ass Mexican food becomes more plausible.  From there it is simple to suppose that occasionally, a few of them would get it into their heads to go on a  really fuckin' heavy-duty  La Bamba's pilgrimage every once in a while.  Like Khotanese Hajjis, the sheer length of their trip demonstrates a truly awe-inspiring devotion.  Considering this, it should come as no surprise that at approximately 3 AM this morning, I would run across two men, wearing Purdue sweatshirts and walking rather briskly up Indiana Avenue, turning on to Kirkwood, and having the following exchange:  "They're gonna be open, right?"  "Yeah man, I just made sure.  I called ahead."  "And they said they'd be open?"  "Yeah."  When they finally reached the steps up to La Bamba's they started whooping and ran inside.  I would call this sad, but about five years ago or so, I drove to Centerville, Iowa, near the Missouri border.  What motivated my trip?  It was far less than an indigestion-inducing burrito, friends.  I went there solely because it is the city nearest to the physical location referenced by the title of the  urlLink Wire  song, " urlLink map ref. 41ºN 93ºW ".  Not that the song has anything to do with Centerville, Iowa, mind you.  The song is essentially about geography in the most abstract possible sense.  The title was probably chosen as a random set of coordinates.  Therefore it is probably fortunate for me that the coordinates did not refer to, for example, the center of the Great Salt Lake or Dutch Harbor, Alaska.  There was certainly nothing in Centerville itself that pointed to the involvement of any late-70s UK art punks.  Centerville is clearly a Randy Travis kind of town, and far from an unrulable expanse of geography.

       Or, invasion of the Pacific Northwest.   Tonight I went to a show.  Where was the show?  Let me quote the email: "The Projects (aka Zespy's) 17th & Jackson by the self storage units and Shakespearience Audio)."  Translation:  inside the self-storage units.  Cutting to the chase, the bands involved this evening were:   Pash , a one-girl band from Portland, OR (originally Minneapolis).  The Dirty Projectors , a one-boy band from Portland, OR.  Anna Oxygen , a one-girl band from Olympia, WA.  [[[VVRRSSNN]]] , pronounced "version", a one-boy band from Portland, OR.  The Blow , a one-girl band from either Fargo, ND, or Portland, OR.  +5 scene points to the first person to guess  urlLink which record label  most of these people are on.  Okay actually only two of them are, but they all may as well be.  Despite a marathon set lasting from 9 PM to nearly 2 AM, I think I can dub the show a reasonably good time.  Pash was up first.  Stylistically she had a lot in common with The Blow, in that she generally performed a capella or with simple backing tracks.  When she came on, she had the audience (I almost said "class" for reasons you will discover immediately) lie down on the floor as she attempted to evoke the mood of naptime in preschool for the purpose of one of her songs.  I can understand where she's coming from, I guess, but the floor was cold concrete and pretty uncomfortable.  She did succeed in making me remember a lot about kindergarten, though, principally how much I hated being forced to do the Hokey Pokey.  As a child, I regarded Mrs. McGrath's fascistic insistence that all of her young charges do the Hokey Pokey, and other related activities, to be immensely humiliating.  I hate the Hokey Pokey and I am entirely convinced that being forced to do it and subsequently being held up for ridicule when I did it wrong scarred me for life, in particular making me incredibly self-conscious about having to dance in public.  Pash (her real name might have been Katie, I couldn't keep track) was however a far nicer person than the fanatical Mrs. McGrath;  all the performers seemed by and large to be nice, friendly, decent people.  This as near as I can tell is well in keeping with the overall philosophy of contemporary K Records acts and releases.  All the acts save one performed mostly vocal music with minimal instrumental backing, and the point of their lyrics seemed in general to be to embarrass the hell out of themselves with honesty.  At any rate, midway through the first song I started to get really dizzy and uncomfortable from having my head flat on concrete, so I sat up, bracing myself to be called out for breaking the K Records sockhop rules, but thankfully I never was.  Pash and Anna Oxygen, who played some fairly energetic synth-poppy stuff akin to a G-Rated  urlLink Gravy Train!!!  (but not as shouty) were both heavily reliant on what I would call an extremely invasive approach to audience participation.  In Pash's case we have the requirement of particular postures for listening, in Anna Oxygen's case the audience was expected to engage in some fairly heavily choreographed dance moves.  I sat quietly on a sofa in the back.  I don't really know what to make so much of that kind of expectation of your audience.  Part of me, whenever I acquiesced to the demands for handclaps or snapping or humming or whatever, expected to be denounced from the stage for being a lemming and falling for the performer's ruse along with the rest of the audience.  Even putting that concern aside I feel like maybe it's an attempt to force a cameraderie with the audience that doesn't really exist and feels sort of fake.  It's a nice gesture and a nice idea, certainly, to want to connect with your audience, and appealing to everybody's (or at least most punk kids') sense of "let's-all-put-on-a-show" is certainly one of the least cynical senses to appeal to;  it would be nicer if it would just happen naturally, instead of making people uncomfortable.  I think one of the reasons I felt uncomfortable (besides memories of kindergarten) was that I knew nobody there.  I think that if I, like the rest of the audience, were in a situation where the people who would see me just abandon a part of my decorum and start acting silly were friends instead of strangers.  The Dirty Projectors (aka Dave) didn't go in for choreography as much, although there was still a little crowd participation.  He had two kinds of song:  some really neat, innovative hip-hoppy stuff which was apparently remixed out of a soundtrack or score he had written, and later on some acoustic material in which he demonstrated a strong similarity to Morrissey (in a good way).  Second to last was [[[VVRRSSNN]]], known to his dentist as Adam.  The original email I recieved says that he is ex-Yume Bitsu, which holds absolutely no significance for me whatsoever.  I met him outside before the show and struck up a conversation with him;  I was disappointed to learn that he was one of the bands and not from Bloomington.  There followed an amusing exchange in which his pronunciation of the word "syncretic" as "syncratic" led to his thinking I'm a moron who doesn't know what syncretism is.  I just wanted to know what "syncratic music" was.  It sounds like a neat idea, doesn't it?  Like some sort of antihierarchical model of improvising or composing.  I guess I may as well lay claim to it.  Misunderstandings aside he seems like a real nice guy.  His set sounded exactly like  urlLink the Durutti Column  (the band that gets continually made fun of in  24 Hour Party People  - I had the misfortune to buy two of their albums before I realized that the first one I bought wasn't just a fluke and they always sound like that).  It lasted about an hour.  I almost fell asleep.  Still, nice guy.  The last act was the Blow.  She's pretty fuckin' good and I recommend you take the opportunity to see her play should it present itself.  Apparently she was in Madison last night with the rest of the bill, which means that that probably won't be for a while.  Her act was the epitome of anti-rockstarism.  She mostly talk-sang, either over prerecorded backing or accompanying herself on the nylon-strung guitar all the bands were sharing.  Thematically she kept pretty much to the "honesty and embarrassment" covered previously but less skilfully by the other bands.  People.  Whatever.  I won't dork out by attempting to get too musicological on this one.  Overall it was a good show played by a group of truly swell human beings.   P.S.   Pash closed her set with a cover of Kelis's "My Milkshake", which for my money is one of the best eight or nine songs ever.

       Louisville, Kentucky is a pretty nice place.   This evening's entertainment agenda featured Kodan Armada, French Toast, Black Eyes, and Q And Not U at the Keswick Democratic Club of Louisville, Kentucky.  It was a good time.  The last two bands managed to elevate the average enjoyment level of the evening to "fucking kick ass".  Kodan Armada are a local act, nothing too special.  They play Orchid-style hardcore and they play it well.  No complaints, catch them if you're not too busy.  French Toast are okay too.  One of them (the bald one) is Fugazi's "fifth member", or so I gather.  His songs aren't that good.  If they played more of the guy with hair's songs they'd be great.  The bald guy's songs are all pretty bassy and shouty, which isn't bad in itself, but they weren't too original.  Also there's only two of them, so while bald guy is singing hair guy is playing drums, and hair guy can't play drums too well.  Bald guy on the other hand is a really good drummer, and hair guy's songs (he plays guitar) are sparkly, streamlined throwbacks to the week in 1998 when it wasn't embarrassing to be called emo.  Now we get to the "fucking rule" portion of the evening.  I don't even think I can explain how much Black Eyes and Q and not U rule.  Both bands had the Louisville kids in an uproar of ass-shaking, and I confess that even I was moved to partake.  At one point the end of a Black Eyes song was met with a disappointed moan from all the rockin' groove junkies.  This is all the more surprising when you consider that the core of the Black Eyes sound is heavy dub atmospherics pierced with a saxophone that vacillates between free skronking and Middle Eastern whinging.  Q and not U are at root a far poppier proposition to begin with, but even their apparently wilful attempts to squander their dance-party goodwill with melodica solos in free rhythm were met with butt twitching and handclaps.  Ah yes the handclaps.  The youth of Kentucky, it turns out, are secretly a horde of trained seals.  They will use any, and I do mean any, excuse to start a handclap section during a song.  All four bands this evening were the beneficiaries of a truly sophisticated handclapping collective - those kids are fast, disciplined, and inventive on the old five and fives.  This is not to disparage the youth of Kentucky.  They are some genuinely nice and outgoing people.  Between songs and sets, I found myself engaged in conversation with the locals almost constantly.  Let's make a little comparison, shall we?   Bloomington, IN:    time spent in locale: One year, two months, four days.   number of people who talk to me at a show: Zero.     Louisville,KY:    time spent in locale: Less than eight hours. (lifetime total)    number of people who talk to me at a show: Around twelve.    Those Louisville kids, though.  They were actually all having fun.  At a show.  It's like nothing I've ever seen.  I realize that I may be making a mistake by seeming to conflate the quality of the show with the niceness of the scene kids, but it's my belief that while the two factors might have fed on each other in a synergistically buzzwordy fashion, they were each in themselves both pretty good.

       The Dismemberment Plan are a bunch of fucking liars.   "College Rock" is not rock and roll.  College Rock is the heresy of the rock idea that says that resistance, while futile, is easy, mellow, and only for the privileged.  At the core of the College Rock ideology is the notion that you get to have four uninterrupted years of beersoaked Good Times away from Mom 'n' Dad before you have to start at the Company, after which you'll always have your Memories of them Good Times.  This notion is endemic to towns like Bloomington, Boston MA, and the entire state of Vermont, which have as their brief the total isolation of young bastards from reality before they are spit back out into a suburb very much like the one they came from.  Many of us hoped that after  urlLink 1991 , this kind of smug, self-satisfied garbage would go the way of  urlLink the Free Design  before it.  Unfortunately it was not to be.  Rather, it would metastatize into the Jam Bands, touring the country non-stop on a quest to depoliticize and commercialize the last remnants of a politically bankrupt and washed-up echo of the counterculture, letting kids pretend to be their parents.  In Bloomington, the only refuge against College Rock is  urlLink John Wilkes Booze , at least until Ian Svenonius shows up and takes his schtick back.  John Wilkes Booze rock, and they rock hard.  They instantiate the very desperation and intensity that every other act in this town lacks.  So why are their fans such a bunch of assholes?  All I want to do is meet someone in this town.  I'm not an unfriendly person.  Shy, maybe, but not unfriendly or mean.  I make an effort.  But the degree of cliquishness here is absolutely astounding.  Finding shows is an absolute impossibility.  Once found, any attempt to break into a conversation is met with shock and horror.  Frankly, I'm confounded.  I suspect that here, Indie Rock is a frat.  A super-secret fraternity with its own handshakes and initiation rituals, and I'm just some wannabe who's blundered into the party.  You know what it  urlLink reminds me of ?  Let me tell you, friends, people complain about places like Madison or Milwaukee or Chicago being cliquish.  Well, in those places, if you see someone at a show you don't recognize, you can assume they're just someone you'd never seen at a show before.  Here, if they don't recognize you, it's like you're some kind of narc.  Last year I accidentally crashed a birthday party - I signed up to a sporadically worthwhile mass e-mail list to try to find out about shows, and the one show I could make it to turned out to be 90% birthday and 10% rock.  The party turned out to be pretty big, with a totally indiscriminate door policy.  After the bands played I was hanging out in the kitchen trying to blend in, and  I found myself standing near a conversation about some band or another that I happened to know something or other about.  I casually attempted to put in my two cents and found myself confronted with a lot of snooty, fuck-off attitude and eyerolling.  Like I was a mere peasant trying to ingratiate myself with royalty.  Later I discovered that  urlLink one of my interlocutors  was the lead singer of  urlLink the Panoply Academy Trenchcoat Mafia ;  apparently I had committed the cardinal Bloomington sin of trying to hang out with a rockstar without the proper vetting.  "The Panoply Whoozis?"  you may ask.  Ek-fucking-zactly.  This is how I came to realize that in Bloomington, you're not even invited to the punk rock show.

       An all-purpose, all-weather assessment of the state of Bloomington, IN   Whenever I run into my friends on the street, their first question is, "So, how do you like living in Chicago?"  After I explain to them that no, I live in Bloomington, Indiana, a small town of 20,000 Confederate partisans and 60,000 fratboys, their next question is, "so how do you like it?"  Short answer:  I don't.  Long answer:  The problem with the long answer is that I'm getting kind of sick of repeating it.  It depresses me, and it makes me sound really negative to all of the genuinely nice and inquisitive people I meet on my trips out of town.  Therefore I have elected to begin this series, on what I hate about Bloomington.  You can check back periodically for updates, but if you know me you've heard them already.  I'll be touching on the food, the students, the nightlife, the location, and whatever else I realize really galls me about living this far south of the IHOP-Waffle House divide.   Issue One:  The food is bad and overpriced.   In a college town, and I don't mean a city with a college or two in it alongside the mass of adults with real jobs and actual responsibilities, but a town with a post office, a college,  va khalas ,  local restaurauteurs take advantage of the hordes of lite-beer/malternative guzzling Young Republicans with nothing to do but drive Daddy's SUV four blocks to burn Daddy's money at a steakhouse, charging no less than seven dollars for lunch at the sort of restaurant where in civilized places they would charge four.  I'm not an overqualified expert in this arena, because as a vegan I am able to eat in exactly three of them.  Cooking for myself is not an option.  Have you ever eaten my cooking?  I did once, and look at me now.  I am not, as one would hope, able to eat in any of the university's cafeterias.  The cafeterias are franchises of popular regional and national fast-food chains, including Burger King, Pizza Hut, and Chick-Fil-A, which I have not yet figured out how to pronounce.  There is also one called "Charleston Market".  Charleston Market appears to be the exact same thing as Boston Market, only with the name changed so as not to offend the cracker population of the state who, 138 years later, are still sore that they had to knock it off with all the slave labor.  If the University had somehow managed to retain any kind of control over their own food service, it would be conceivable that a group could lobby the school to have the menu changed.  What kind of remedy do the people have against Pizza Hut?  Not eating there?  I don't eat there anyway, and it hasn't seemed to hurt them any.  As I see it, the only way there could be any citizen input into the food served at Indiana University is if the fast-food industry were nationalized.  Not that I'm advocating that.  But it should be looked into.

       Don't bum out cigarettes to strange Chicagoans.    This was going to be a story about this weird girl my friends and I met Saturday night, but it got pretty moralistic.  It also got to be about five single-spaced pages long.  I have elected instead to present a few highlights:    My friend Kevin and I bum a cigarette to a normal-looking girl outside of Dunkin' Donuts.  Instead of going away, she follows us to a bar.   After telling us we both look gay, she announces her intention to get men to buy her free drinks all night by showing as much of her breasts as the law allows as often as possible.  Only after this do we find out her name is Amy.   She keeps trying to pocket lighters and pens from everyone all night, and bums an estimated total of 35 cigarettes from four people.  I couldn't really keep score on the drinks, but she did seem to be getting drunker without getting noticeably poorer for the duration of the night.   She keeps challenging me to games of Galaga, which I win handily.  It doesn't matter because she invariably loses interest and wanders off after her first ship dies.   As soon as my friend Anders arrives, she gloms on to him and manages to con him out of at least one drink before she goes up to the bar for a minute and we're able to explain to him that we have no idea who the hell she is, but she's nuts and that in retrospect, giving her our real names was probably not wise.   She draws a preschool-caliber marker picture, purportedly a unicorn, on Anders's back.   Before she leaves she gives Anders her email address.  I suggest to Anders's friend Erica that she pass it to some poor slob over by the bar.  She declines.    The overarching life lessons to be learned are these:   Don't go to Dunkin' Donuts.   When you challenge someone to Galaga, go first.   Don't expect to find great art anywhere on Anders except his right shoulder.   Erica needs to start being crueler to strangers.   Fortunately for me I live in Bloomington and I can't go back to Chicago for at least another three weeks (Yay papers.  Yay Jason Spaceman).  My doomed companions, however, are there, in Chicago, with Her, where she roams around, sure to meet with them again.  It's only a matter of time.  I only hope she's not on Friendster.

       Much.   I'm a non-smoker.  Until extremely recently I could say this without hedging.  Now, to be perfectly honest, I don't generally smoke.  Why don't I smoke?  Of course there are many reasons:  It's gross, it causes cancer, it's expensive, all that money goes straight to Pat Robertson, and Ian MacKaye would be disappointed in me.  None of these are my reasons.  I don't smoke because in 1995 a particularly attractive girl I knew told me that my cigarette smoking was the only impediment to our having, and this is an  exact  quote, "a torrid sexual liaison".  I'm fairly certain that this comment did not constitute a standing offer.  I completely lost touch with her two years ago and I think I can be confident that we have not been within five hours of one another once since 1999.  Despite these facts, in the handful of times I've lit up since quitting, the one thing that runs through my head is that she might somehow be in the same bar and catch me, and I'll blow my chance  yet again .  In fact, right now I feel sort of like I could use a cigarette.  I'm not going to have one, though.  Why?  Because if on some off chance she's here in Southern Indiana tonight, I want my breath to be as minty fucking fresh as possible.  Even moreso now that I've found out what "torrid" means.

       . . .an old rock band.    urlLink Blumfeld , in their prime, were probably one of the best bands on record.  Unfortunately for their international popularity, they sing exclusively in German.  For the one or two of you who are not familiar with the Blumfeld  oeuvre , it would be helpful perhaps to imagine  urlLink Christie Front Drive , but in German.  But the Blumfeld story is not a happy one.  It is depressing and irksome.  The simple fact is that it remains a mystery how the same band that released  Ich-Maschine  and the truly indispensible  urlLink  L'Etat Et Moi   could possibly be responsible for the total piece of crap that is  Testament Der Angst  with only one other album intervening.  To date Blumfeld's one true classic album is the aforementioned  L'Etat et moi  (Big Cat 1994).  It moves from peak to peak.  The shimmering album-opener "Draussen auf Kaution" ("Out on bail") would later be recalled, albeit speeded-up and slopped-out, in the entire recorded output of . . .And You Will Know Us By The Trail of Dead.  From there we get more abstract, postpunk, Fugazoid tunage like "Jet Set", "Eine eigene Geschichte" ("A True Story"), and "Verstärker" ("Amplifier").  The antecedents to their sound are clearly to be found in Fugazi, Husker Du, Swervedriver, or similar groups.  Passing over the simply average  Old Nobody  (in retrospect the beginning of the end), we arrive at 2001's  Testament der Angst  ("Testament of Fear").   Testament  exists in an entirely separate universe from Blumfeld's first two albums.  It is truly a shock to listen to after having been exposed to their prior output.  It is schmaltz.  It is overproduced, and parts of it drip with the kind of easy-listening, smug, "groovy" sax solos that got Steve Winwood assigned to political reeducation.  At one point during "Anders als Glücklich" ("Other than happy") lead singer Jochen Distelmeyer even employs the device of tossing off an aside to his backup singers.  One would hope this sort of exchange is done in homage to Scritti Politti rather than Dean Martin, but the effect is the same.  It is a bad album.  It deserves to be included on a canonical list of bad albums by once-great bands.  This is not rare, and it is usually not a tragedy.  Hey Mercedes'  Everynight Fire Works  is also, in its own way, total shit.  However, it is total shit because it is clear that the band have run out of ideas, and that their melodic instincts have given way to the rote reproduction of ideas which have proven themselves to be effective.  It is composition on autopilot.  This is also the reason  Harmacy  is a bad album.  More generally, it is the reason all ska is artistically bankrupt.  That could not be further from the case with Blumfeld.  Not only does every last overproduced piece of schmaltz on the album, buried under enervated musicianship, phoned-in (if ultracompetent) performances, and the kind of vocal mugging practiced by ersatz Sinatras the world over, feature consistently great songwriting reminiscent of the band at their prime, but it's clear that head songwriter Distelmeyer is still listening, and still drawing in influences and ideas.  He's also still thinking - typically you'd expect that when a band as political as Blumfeld is goes pop-rock, they'd trade in the leftism for a politically quietistic focus on girls and heartbreak, but no, these songs are all just as explicit in their political commitment as their old ones.  Nowhere is this more clear than on the title track.  The song is clearly an anomaly on the album.  First of all, the production heavily forefronts distorted bass, and an organ carries the rudimentary tune.  What the music suggests to me is that someone in the band has more than a passing familiarity with  urlLink Big Black , Happy Go Licky, and contemporary synth-/ dracula-core acts like maybe Song of Zarathustra, Shortwave Channel, or  urlLink Milemarker .  Of course, we're still listening through that aggravating Quincy Jones production, so it's like getting a glimpse of our nursing-home listening habits:  It's 2060, and they've figured out a way to play the Locust in a way that doesn't put us over-eighties off our meds.  To say nothing of the quality of the track (it sucks, but the song is great - someone should play a version with some freaking  balls ) it indicates that the band continues to listen to and receive ideas from loud North American underground music, which is the best kind of North American underground music in North America.  This is why the fact that  Testament  is a bad album is so unfortunate.  This is not a band that's just up and gone soft.  This is a band that for some reason or another has made a conscious decision to play the kind of crapola that I can only assume gets them airplay in Germany, but they just can't help themselves - Song of Zarathustra has gotten to them, and they want to incorporate some of those elements, no matter how debased they have to make it.  PS -  I learned while researching this little rant that Blumfeld just released a new album,  Jenseits von Jedem , last month.  Of course the only reviews of it I found are on   urlLink Amazon.de , and are therefore even more slavishly positive than the ones in Rolling Stone.  So I may be writing back in a few months with a postmortem on that one there.

       Listen to more Comet Gain, you fuckers.   Today's post has prerequisites:  The Pitchfork reviews of  urlLink  Tigertown Pictures   and  urlLink  Realistes  ;  not because I think they have anything important to say, mind you, but because I've been put on notice that if I don't churn out more serviceable product on a more regular basis I might not get paid.  Therefore this review will be interpolated with a review of a review, thereby becoming simultaneously a review and a meta-review, which is more of that postmodern stuff the kids seem to dig.  Most importantly, it will reach a length that doesn't seem like a waste of time to post.  Let me first say that I don't understand the constant Sonic Youth comparisons the  Pitchfork  staff seem intent on making.  The most puzzling example is when it is suggested that early Sonic Youth was "lo-fi pop".  Yeah, lo-fi pop like fucking "Sonic Death", junior.  Comparing everything to "early Sonic Youth" (which means  Goo , maybe?) is the twentysomething version of the constant Boomer-hipster insistence that everything sounds like the Velvet Underground:  The Pixies, Velocity Girl, Les Savy Fav, Fugazi, Spiritualized (okay, bad example), Bardo Pond.  Sure, gramps.  Why don't you just sit back in your easy chair while Grandma Ray spikes you up?  One cannot argue that Comet Gain's sound is in any way original or unique - they have a long string of distinct influences, none of which are Sonic Youth:   urlLink the C-86 movement , Huggy Bear, the Jam, the Smiths and the Who, just to name a couple.  One can however argue contrary to the good people at Pitchfork, who we must remember are entitled to their incorrect opinons, that they rock with a pilled-up intensity those lugubrious noise reptiles in Sonic Youth* haven't managed since "Bad Moon Rising", and not before then either.  "The Kids At The Club" (from  Realistes ) is the perfect expression of the rush you get when you're about to go out and really kick shit up, and "Record Collection" (from  Tigertown Pictures ) is probably the only breakup song I've ever heard that isn't total bullshit.  And that's just first tracks.   Pitchfork  charges pretentiousness.  Exactly.  Pretentiousness, particularly by way of couching your every move in the iconography of the  nouvelle vague  is one of the hallmarks of the twee pop genre to which Comet Gain, for all their feedback scree, well and truly belongs.  But no matter how pretentious Comet Gain get, and leaving out the few slow songs scattered across their albums ( "Sneaky"  being another, not discussed here), they never stop putting out numbers which would fill dance floors everywhere if you weren't so anesthetized to the possibilities of group movement by the Get Up Kids that it takes ! fucking !! beating you over the head with disco to remember that you have hips.  ____ *I like Sonic Youth.

       Actually, apparently not.    I previously posted this over on a different blog.  But apparently nobody wants a mixtape over there.  So they're still just sitting around gathering dust.  Come on, people!  Who doesn't want free mixtapes?  Listen to them!  Trade them!  Pass them off as your own to that cute girl from Biology class!  I guarantee results!  Furthermore, in the interest of something or other, I present this post in an alternate version.  A version which I will edit once again when I am not so fucking tired.   The first ten people to  urlLink email me  with GIMME FREE SHIT in the subject: header* will get themselves their very own free mixtape as composed by yours truly, duplicated and thrown in a mailbox by Saturday afternoon.  I guarantee you quality;  I do not guarantee you stuff you like or recognize.  I reserve the right to fix you up with mixtapes composed as early as 1994.  This may involve ska.  It may involve Bauhaus.  It  will  involve Mocket.  I also reserve the right to fix you up with mixtapes composed as recently as tomorrow afternoon, probably starting around four p.m. or so after I get back from the RIFIAS library if I'm not too damn tired.  Why are you damned people not listening to more Mocket**?  They've managed to do your beloved Ladytron, Broadcast, Le Tigre, etcetera one better***, by getting their facts on the ground in a timelier fashion.  And they're punk as all hell.  Even though more likely than not you'll be getting "First Screening" which while attitudinally punk as fuck, is musically pure stasis.  I love "First Screening".  I love it so fucking much that I seem to have some sort of sick compulsion to put it on every mixtape I make.  I consider it a personal victory against this particular backmonkey when I convince myself to make do with, say, "Bionic Parts" or "New Maps Of Hell".  I must also guard against "Halo".  "Halo" is to "First Screening" as methadone is to heroin.  For all its supposed virtue all it does is leave you wanting the hard stuff.  The genius of "First Screening" lies in three interlocking fields: (the deadpan, monotone, anonymously American vocals) deliver (a nonnarrative of absolute depersonalization) over (a trancelike synthesizer drone).  "Karma Police" partakes of something of the heroic;  from the quiet, almost plainspoken introduction it surges into a near-falsetto, tragic chorus:  "For a minute, I lost myself".  The implication naturally is that the self has been lost, but also subsequently regained.  It suggests a setting:  The narrator (feel free to picture Thom Yorke in the role;  this identification is almost mandated by the logic of the music video as a genre), bloodied but unbowed, his face shiny with the sweat and grime of his struggle, emoting against the Sturm und Drang of the refrain, possibly represented by a black backdrop, or the night sky.  The appearance of the actual video is irrelevant here.  "First Screening" also suggests a setting:  Our narrator wears an ill-fitting new suit (and a Hitler hairdo?).  The pulse of outmoded synthesizers suggests a placid interior location, maybe an office.  Certainly the walls of this interior are pastel blue, clinical white, or some such nonthreatening color.  The narrator's explicit reference to loss of memory implies loss of self.  Rather than rail against this loss of self (which is fundamentally impossible - there would be no self present to comment on its own subsumption) the narrator accepts it as fact, which is the only logical course open to her.  "First Screening" exposes "Karma Police" as fascist.  Given the nature of Radiohead's career, particularly its relationship to a massive audience, this is unsurprising.  Radiohead have failed dramatically in their attempts to subvert their status as "rock stars".  Thom Yorke is an easily-identifiable personage.  Most importantly, their attempts to defuse the machinery of rock stardom by issuing gnomic, "political", and "difficult" statements have (from a certain perspective) completely backfired.  By commenting as Radiohead do from the bully pulpit of the "arty English stadium rocker" they merely reinforce the idea that a "serious artist" is expected to have "difficult ideas" and furthermore the idea that leaders of culture necessarily have important things to say that must be taken seriously.  Radiohead's " Nolo episcopari ", no matter how vehemently clung to on record or in the press, is everything a  nolo episcopari  ever was:  less a denial than a formula of acceptance.  Radiohead as a public idea is constructed in large part around the image of Thom Yorke as an individual - the individual who is the source of all of the group's pronunciamenti.  As noted above, Radiohead do absolutely nothing to subvert the typical equation made in the modern pop song of vocalist with narrator, either in the songs themselves  or in their promotional videos.  This means that through such songs as "Karma Police" and through the overall public presentation that Radiohead have devised for themselves Thom Yorke is posited as an almost generic Romantic hero.  You can see where this is going by now, can't you?  He is the only man alive who will combat the demons of the modern age, and his ability to resist those demons is superhuman.  It's enough to make a person doubt that the lyrics to "Paranoid Android" are ironic.  *Just so you know, there is no way in hell I will ever sell or transfer your personal information or any portion thereof to anyone anywhere at any time for any fuckin' reason whatsoever****.  Also if your subject header does not read GIMME FREE SHIT I will ignore your message, no matter how bestest of pals we may or may not be.  I don't give stuff to people who are above a little casual cussin'.  **I cribbed this locution from  Last Plane To Jakarta .  ***I cribbed this one from  High Fidelity .  ****Actually, if you write in with anything remotely resembling moronic "HOW CAN U HAET RADIOHED THEYRR AWSUM" crap you are thereby expressly giving me permission to both (a) sign you up for every single porn and religious spam list there is and (b) write your home and cell phone number on every bathroom stall in North America.

       Pseudomorphosis is my favorite snob rush.   I confess that I like to trick people.  I am a deceitful, cruel bastard. One of the more sublime ways in which I like to decieve people is by subjecting them to relative obscurities which bear a marked resemblance to far more acclaimed acts.  In 1997, this was far easier as bait-and-switching Fugazi for Mission of Burma was always a productive gambit.  Today as bands like Mission of Burma experience a revival in their popularity and the new wave of punk/snob/indie bands mine such absolute unknowns as Human League for their sounds my fix is becoming harder and harder to obtain.  I can always rely on Swervedriver to deceive the odd errant Braid fan, but these are a dying breed.  The first My Bloody Valentine album ( urlLink No, not this one, you amateur .  urlLink Not even this one, but nice try and we should date  ( urlLink are you busy Thursday night ?).   urlLink This one . Yeah.) is absurdly a near-dead ringer for the Murder City Devils.  It also takes a while to grow on you, but that's beside the point.  They are lowdown, mean, straight-ahead rock songs, any one of which would have made a better b-side for "Dancing Shoes" than "Tokyo Gold".  More absurd even than this, the resemblance of the Murder City Devils to an absurd early-career, pre-Bilinda and Debbie, totally atypical MBV obscurity, is the apparent source of some of Fugazi's cribs.  Fugazi have to date pulled at least a riff and a solo, if not substantial portions of the Guy Piccioto guitar oeuvre from Apaslar's 1969 national hit single, "Gilgamesh".  If you've never heard it, you're not alone, because the nation in question is the Republic of Turkey.  The song however appears to be the Urquell or at least the inspiration for "Life and Limb" as well as "Closed Captioned".  The solo near the end has in fact prompted at least two people in my direct personal experience to say "Is this Fugazi?";  I've also gotten one "so this is that One Last Wish thing, huh?"  I personally have access to the song as it is included on  urlLink this compilation ; it would be totally unsurprising to discover this disc on offer at any old Washington DC record store.  I however prefer to believe a far more complicated and danger-fraught web of transmission, which you would understand if you would watch  The French Connection  already.

       Duty now for thElizabeth!   Regular readers of this blog (all four of you), as well as new readers who read the "Comments" section of the previous post, will know that I was recently requested to hold forth with my views on DEVO for an entire week's worth of posts.  Around here a "week's worth" of posts averages out to maybe a paragraph, so I'm just going to go all-out and hit you with an  entire  DEVO-related post!    Understand, dear readers, that this is quite an impressive sacrifice which I am making for this blog.  In the course of researching this post I have listened to, and therefore handled, the four most indispensable DEVO albums,  Are We Not Men? ,  Duty Now For The Future ,  New Traditionalists , and of course  Freedom Of Choice .  That's right, four.  That's a lot of DEVO.  Here's the sacrifice part:  DEVO, not only independently but also by dint of their association with 1981 cartoon titty-bomb  urlLink  Heavy Metal  , are inextricably infected with the taint of total geekdom.  The practical ramification of this is that, each time you handle, let alone listen to, a DEVO album, you must make your save vs. breath weapon or girls will avoid you for 1d20 days per album.  In the unlikely event that you are a girl with access to both DEVO albums and a 20-sided die, you must immediately buy 1d4 more cats.  Now, an astute reader, not having been turned off by the rampant dorkery manifested in the previous paragraph, has probably begun speculating about the main point of this article.  "Aha," he or she is thinking, "this is the part where Mr. Frankfurt School  manqué  starts to bitch about the fascist implications of 'Triumph Of The Will' and 'Gates Of Steel'". Wrong, smartass!  I find the casually sexist implications of "Pink Pussy Cat", "Jerkin' Back And Forth", and "Come Back Jonee" (you heard me) far more troubling than the obviously intentional attitude-mongering of those other songs, and at any rate it's not all neo- urlLink Baffler ian cultural polemic here at This Is Not A Fugazi T-Shirt.  If I were looking for a point of entry on that topic, I would start by noting that DEVO's skewering of the gray-flannel-suited 1950's vintage executive type, already dated by their late-'70s/early-'80s heyday, served to conceal corporate America's unending attempts to coopt, reify, and neutralize countercultural and populist streams of American thought by disguising itself and its product to conform stylistically to perceived "outsider" and "cutting edge" culture, and indeed by propagating "cutting edge" culture itself;  planned obsolescence drives cultural markets as much as material ones.  Remember the Monkees*?  Remember the Knack**?  Remember the Strokes***?  I would go on to point out however that despite its signing to Warner Brothers Records, DEVO probably avoided total cooptation simply by being too dorky and uncool for their image to be worth marketing.  But I'm not going to do that today.     Oh wait.  Moving right along.  Some people would have you believe that DEVO's greatness, or at least their DEVO-y goodness, lies entirely in their sonic embodiment of the gawky misanthropic nerd, in the way that "Whip It" [the first record I ever owned (thanks Mom)] or "Shrivel-up" bend and twist uneasily like some kid whose growth spurt only hit half of him.  That's certainly part of it.  But in overemphasizing the overtly dorkish aspects of DEVO's sound (the synthesizers, the monotone nasal chanting, the nervously twitching drums) we ignore what it is that compels people to continue to listen to DEVO again and again long after their moment in the sun has passed.  It's obvious, isn't it?  DEVO rock.  You can turn up DEVO albums and shout along with them on long car rides, and  other people will join in .     They outlasted the most eminent groups of their moment and even some of the most critically-respected.  When they finally foundered ( EZ Listening Disc ), they had left a legacy at least as great as that of Pere Ubu (especially their nineties output, JEBUS KEE-RIST) or the Cars.  DEVO's cultural impact is immense.  Let's consider a few of their major achievements.   The favorite band of  urlLink Indiana's favorite son .   Wrote the song which inspired one of MTV's  urlLink early forays into keeping music videos off the TV .   Awakened Americans to the danger posed by spending too long in Ohio, a state so shitty that even Indianans hate it.   _____ *Speaking as someone who enjoys listening to "Steppin' Stone", even the original. **Speaking as someone who enjoys listening to "My Sharona". ***Speaking as someone who FUCKING DESPISES "12:51", and all the other ones too.  There are very few songs named after numbers that are any good at all.  Gang of Four wrote two of them.

       Sometimes the shiny things are worth less.   If one wanted to accuse the editorial staff of TINAFT of occasionally deviating from its original brief (conveniently located to the lower right) it would not be too difficult.  I am both proud and sad to announce that today's post delves into the realm of the disappointing.  The object of my disappointment is the latest album from the UK group  urlLink Empress ,  The Sounds They Made .  To date, Empress, consisting of current and former members of  urlLink Hood , Boyracer, and Halkyn has made a number of excellent recordings for the Pehr and Geographic labels which are typically compared to albums by Low and Ida.  These comparisons are fair enough in extremely general terms but breaks down on further investigation, as such comparisons invariably do, in this case because Empress are suffused with a sparseness that Low and Ida lack, and because Low and Ida are boring, with one listenable album ( Secret Name ) between them.  The centerpieces of a typical Empress composition are pretty, simple, minor-key melodies; an almost extravagantly ascetic deployment of space; and the impression of extreme quiet even despite periodic shrieks of distorted feedback.  These qualities are in fact all present on  The Sounds They Made , as are ten truly great songs, but great songs do not a great album make.  No, because there is one further quality that Empress's prior output possessed which set it above the rest, which I have sneakily refrained from mentioning until now.  Empress, in common with early Godspeed You Black Emperor!, is one of the rare bands whose sonic effectiveness is improved by adversity.  GYBE! surrounded its first few recordings with static, distortion, and odd voice-overs, giving the effect of a weakly received radio transmission.  Similarly the space between the notes on the  Homeward Sounds  EP is not quiet;  it is blanketed with a thin sheet of noise that likewise creates and aura of age and distance.   The Sounds They Made  lacks this quality, and it is this very lack which makes the album such a disappointment.  The album is naturally not a bad one.  The songs on it are all excellent, it is more the circumstance of their recording rather than their execution which is at fault.  To be sure, this album sees Empress develop elements in their sound which are probably better left uninvestigated.  On the track "All Is New Glow", clicktronic buzzes come unexpectedly and unwelcomely to the fore;  all over the album the tone of the keyboard is somehow rendered cloyingly sweet.  Most noticeably, the icy static hiss which lurked at the corners of previous albums has been tamed to no worthwhile effect.  Perhaps this is the result of newfound fondness for things digital;  perhaps it is because Empress's appetite for noise is being satisfied through other channels (Halkyn?).    Change and growth are of course necessary in music.  On their latest album Empress have moved forward their songwriting and playing, making the album musically quite essential, but simply by making what would certainly seem to be minor technical improvements they have done great damage to the core of their sound.

       Songs on repeat:  My not-so-secret shame .  Due to various autobiographical details which are entirely unneccessary to discuss at this point, I spend a whole lotta time in the car.  I think my lifetime average time per sitting spent behind the wheel of an automobile is at least five hours.  Therefore, as you might well imagine, I listen to quite a lot of music.  Over the years I have worn out one tape deck and two portable CD players;  currently I do not leave the driveway without a tape deck, a Discman, and an iPod.  One advantage to taking long road trips all by your lonesome is that you're in total control of the stereo.  Whatever you want to hear, you can, assuming you remembered to bring it along and it's not sitting on your kitchen counter where you will find it waiting, patiently, after your return from a trip which was plagued with the constant unfulfilled urge to listen to "Seasons in the Abyss" while you had to make do with "Raining Blood".  The disadvantage of total stereo control (TSC) is that your every musical wish can be more-or-less immediately fulfilled.  The end result of this is that one is free to become a musical Caligula in one's own car.  There is nothing stopping you, should you desire it, from putting Managra's "Tough Like Truax" on repeat all the way from Champaign to Indianapolis ( Why do we play these games? ).  Or from taking the long way around 465 so you can cycle through "My Milkshake", "Crazy In Love" and Lyn Collins' "Think (About It)" at least thrice before hitting IN-67, which trip has been reserved for Unwound's  New Plastic Ideas .

       The scrap of the century   The quintessential rock debate, people of a certain age and even younger will insist, is the war between The Beatles and The Stones.  These two counterposed entities describe and define the available rock space and the range of possible attitudes and techniques to be adopted by all subsequent fans and practitioners of the rock form.  "The Beatles just wanted to hold your hand;  the Stones wanted to pillage your town," is one of the more popular and evocative formulations of the dichotomy.  The split is easy to see manifested in trends in rock stylism prevalent over the past ten or so years.  Today's preference for the White Stripes, the Raveonettes, Kings of Leon and so forth, with their emphasis on dirty-livin' images and more clearly blues-based melodies and song structures represents a swing of the pendulum in the Stones direction, away from Beatles-land, where it had been residing with the Flaming Lips, Neutral Milk Hotel, and the various other devotees of the Brian Wilson "me too" Sgt. Pepper Beatles cult.  This dichotomy, it will be readily understood, is total crap.  Back in the halcyon days of high school, my attendant cronies and I, dissecting the issue, came out with what we were sure was the unassailably correct answer to this entire debate:   the Who .  Well, not The Who exactly, it was more like the  idea  of the Who as prototypes of the atomsmashing punker:  strip away all that troubling  Tommy  baggage, the post-Moon output, the solo careers.   That  Who.  The "Substitute"/ Live At Leeds  Who.  Older and wiser, we now realize that the crap Who cannot be extricated from the good Who; the crapness of rock operas like  Tommy  is inescapably bound up with the aceness of rock operas like "A Quick One While He's Away".  More importantly, the Who, rather than transcending the Stones-Beatles split, merely seem to straddle it uncomfortably, spanning a gap whose construction we already accept.  This of course returns us to square one.  Knowing that this two-part rock music split is unsatisfactory, we must cast about for the third or possibly fourth elemental rock star.  Essentially, what makes the Beatles and the Stones able to function the way they do is that they exist early enough in the canonical history of Rock Music that they have no influences who are themselves part of the Rock Canon, barring (in the Beatles' case) Buddy Holly.  Elvis?  Neither of those bands sound like Elvis.  This means that while later artists can be described in terms of their relation to those two groups, there is basically no point of reference to describe them without going outside the more tightly defined sphere of rock and roll.  The same is true of their lesser contemporaries like the Hollies or the Blues Breakers.  Even a more influential contemporary like Bob Dylan cannot be understood as working as entirely within a pop-rock context as the Beatles or even the Stones (despite their blues-band origins).  While the Rolling Stones would eventually be accepted as a pop or rock group with only tenuous links to the blues idiom, Bob Dylan even today is understood by many people as a folk musician with a pop following.  The other day I was walking down the street, attempting to uncover the genius of Jeff Lynne and the Electric Light Orchestra.  You may recognize the Electric Light Orchestra from their recent hit "Go buy a Volkswagen" and "Go see the new Jim Carrey movie".  ELO have been widely and unfairly ridiculed in ages past on all sides until their recent, fully-deserved, probably Grandaddy-led revival.  ELO sit ill with most right-thinking rock fans because of their full-on Up With People mid-70s AM radio hippy-prog cathedrals of sound.  These right-thinking rock fans have clearly never heard The Free Design, who are the true avatars of full-on Up With People mid-70s AM radio hippy-prog cathedral of sound  with a jazz tinge  suckage.  The official party line is that Jeff Lynne built his entire career off of trying to emulate the production on late-model Beatles ( Let It Be ) and solo John Lennon albums and just slightly missing the mark, this being supposedly proven by his tenure in The Travelling Wilburys.  However, listening to some classic ELO ("It's A Livin' Thing", "Evil Woman", "Strange Magic", "Go buy a Volkswagen") in direct conjunction with a few other, seemingly unconnected groups (Bauhaus, Joy Division, Men's Recovery Project) threw their shared characteristics into sharp relief.  In the case of Bauhaus and Joy Division the connections are numerous and well-researched, but one aspect of their sounds in particular, characterized by a particular dryness in production and an aura of icy detachment even in the heaviest raveups ("Stigmata Martyr" and "Ice Age", respectively), is also a key component of the ELO  oeuvre .  It is only ELO's seeming stylistic distance from these groups that kept it from being properly diagnosed.  In other recordings, particularly gothic and postpunk material, this syndrome is fairly prosaic and easily-identified, being essentially a hallmark of the styles; so prosaic is it in fact that it has a name:  I am speaking of course of Bowie damage.  Clearly this is the answer to the ages-old riddle;  the third unit in the Beatles-Stones system.  Listening to such diverse groups as Gang of Four, Fugazi, Boards of Canada, the aforementioned Joy Division and Bauhaus and even total shit like Pink Floyd, which bear zero stylistic affinities to either the Stones or the Beatles, one can clearly see the stylistic traces of David Bowie fanaticism.  The Bowie myth even positions him appropriately to occupy the role:  like the Beatles and the Stones, David Bowie has no stylistic predecessors who work within a properly "rock" idiom, despite his early attempts in a less-distinctive vein and his fairly late entry into the rock icon sweepstakes (would someone tell me if that's the name of a TV show or something?).  Now that we have opened the field of paradigmatic rock acts to more than two contenders we will doubtless be flooded with many more;  there aren't any other groups that are as widely relevant, however, and so other claims will have to be dismissed:  the Velvet Underground?  Sure, I like them, and you like them, but has your kid brother even fucking  heard  of them?  the Greatful Dead?  Distinctive, yes.  Influential, yes.  Wankarama for thirty thousand hippies waving their arms around in a mud pit, yes.  Black Sabbath are probably the closest to a legitimate contender for the fourth spot, but the fame of Ozzy Osbourne, prophet of doom, as opposed to Ozzy Osbourne, klutzy dad, is still pretty much limited to people who smell like Otto's jacket.  Wow, all that and no clicky text.  Oh well, have some  urlLink zombies .

       In retrospect, Hall & Oates were pretty fucking street.   Think about Hall & Oates for a moment.  How much do we really know about them?  If, like me, you were born in the latter half of the 1970s, you were raised at least in part on the very MOR, very inoffensive stylings of Messrs. Daryl Hall and John Oates.  "Private Eyes,"  "Maneater," "Say It Isn't So," and the dreaded "M.E.T.H.O.D. of Modern Love".  These songs, and the very image of Hall & Oates, have come to denote a particular breed of crud.  Blue-eyed soul, as practiced by luminaries from the Righteous Brothers through to Michael Bolton (solo) has always been about proving to the world at large that thirtysomething American white males, even those who sang backup for the Delfonics,  can't stop making the fucking Springsteen face  for thirty seconds while singing, and Hall & Oates have always been at the top of that game.  1977, the year of my birth, was also the year of release of H&O's classic "Rich Girl".  The ramifications of this are far-reaching.  Growing up, the song was never "new" to me, but due to the vagaries of most normal radio formats at the time it remained in semiregular rotation on most contemporary rock and pop stations;  it was perpetually familiar and as such I ignored it.  A few weeks ago I was screwing around with the radio between Indianapolis and Chicago and I came across it once again.  My initial reaction was bemusement, followed by a degree of shock.  I mean, have you ever listened to the  lyrics ?  My parents were always pretty permissive on the whole "bad words" issue, but to have listened to "Rich Girl" for so long and not picked up the profanities?  Hell, to have not picked up on the whole point of the song?  "Rich Girl" is basically a lecture or a bawl-out delivered to a young woman of the narrator's acquaintance who is using money acquired from either her father or an unrelated older man (ahem) in an evidently unwise and profligate manner, likely on illegal narcotics.  Although naturally it is not delivered with the clarity or force one would expect in the later work of an artist like, for example, Ice-T,  the juxtaposition of the subject matter with such a lite-rock backing track is jarring enough.  Listening now, it is truly surprising that such a track made it under the censor's radar in Reagan's America.

       It's a good album, surprise.   Generally speaking, one can periodize the history of Stereolab into four distinct eras:  the first, comprising the albums  Peng  and  Transient Random-Noise Bursts With Announcements  could be glibly described as their punk period.  These two albums feature the most simplistic chordal structures, the instrumentation is more traditionally "rock", and the grooves are straightforward and driving.  Next is a period of increasing sophistication, with more emphasis on the organ and more interest in Latin American forms ( The Groop Played "Space-Age Bachelor Pad Music" ,  Mars Audiac Quintet ); this progress culminates in  Emperor Tomato Ketchup  and  Dots And Loops , which showcase the canonical Stereolab sound:  French 60s pop classicism is the most apparent element of the sound, and the Neu! cribs are mated with electronic flourishes of a more recent vintage.  Following this is what I call "the crap years".  The next three albums,  Cobra And Phases Group Play Voltage In The Milky Night ,  The First Of The Microbe Hunters , and  Sound-Dust ,  are bad and I don't enjoy listening to them.  So I don't, and therefore    I can't describe them for you.  Fortunately, however,  Margerine Eclipse  is not bad.  It is quite good, in fact.  In part, it represents a return to the sound of the  Dots And Loops  era, although the extent to which this is true is unclear to me, because as I said I don't listen to the albums which came out between this one and that.  That's not to say it's a stylistic retreat, although Stereolab appear to have resurrected elements of their earlier sounds in making this one.  "Margerine Rock" for example combines the sort of dorky organ line one finds on  Emperor Tomato Ketchup  with a very  urlLink  Peng! -y  sense of flow.  Plus some gonzo guitar histrionics.  So it's all good.  What seems to distinguish this album from the previous few is the attitude.  The songs here are punchier, the playing more aggressive, the mood a little more sour.  That's not to say that this is an all-new, all-ass-kickin' Stereolab, but it goes quite a long way in convincing me that the familiar on this album is not simply in due to retrenchment or a wilful shining up of the old as the new.

       In retrospect, not the most productive way to spend spring break   Well, Spring Break '04 has come and gone, and once again it was the best Sophomore year ever.  Taking into account the fact that spending a full week alone in Bloomington with nothing to do but do actual schoolwork would have driven me mad, mad, mad I tell you, I took to the road with nothing but the clothes on my back, some personal hygeine supplies, and 1,900 pounds of Dodge Neon shrieking down the highway.  My quest for nothing in particular led me through five states, a pair of musical venues, and a whole fuckload of restaurants.    Monday, 15. March -- Dillinger Four@The Fireside Bowl, Chicago IL   I hate to sound like an asshole, but after so many years it's still ho, hum, another D4 show.  Back in the less-than-halcyon days of my youth in the frigid wastes of central Wisconsin (see below) I saw these guys many a time, often in various stages of public undress.  Then as now, the pop-inflected, gruff gallows-humored punk rock throwdown was in full effect.  They're good and all, but this wasn't really my bag then, and it's still not now.  If I were more comfortable rocking out with beer and kielbasa tightly in hand, things might be different.  There were three openers, and two I guess stood out.  Sweet JAP are a quartet of poppily spastic Minnesotans who while provoking quite the positive crowd reaction were lost on me.  Their album, which I heard in part later on the same day, was even poppier than their live appearance, and more rock-classicist besides.  The band that really got my attention at this show was the Tyrades, from Chicago.  Where the rest of the day's bands were loud, fast, angry, and melodic, the Tyrades are just fucking splenetic.  While so many bands in their position temper the punk rock with heavy metal in order to  convey the usual range of pissy emotions, the Tyrades just vomit forth electrocuting punk rock on par with Skull Kontrol.    Tuesday, 16. March   I went to  urlLink Soul Vegetarian  and  urlLink Metal Haven .  Within two hours of each other.  How's that for cognitive dissonance?    Tuesday, 16. March - Friday, 18. March   I always like driving in Wisconsin, even more so when it's still cold and there are periodic flurries like there were Tuesday night.  It's just so not Indiana.  My overall experience of Wisconsin this time was not positive, because I remained asleep on my parents' couch, sick with a mild mystery ailment, possibly  urlLink Nugent's Disease , for most of the week.  During my periodic bouts of consciousness I caught up with cable television and hung out with the folks.      Friday, 18.March -- Joan of Arc@The Triple Rock, Minneapolis MN   If there can truly be said to be any sort of overarching irony of the week it was that I drove to Chicago to see some bands from Minneapolis, and then drove to Minneapolis to see some bands from Chicago.  Those bands were Joan of Arc, Make Believe, and the Love of Everything, all of which share a substantial portion of their memberships with one another.  Evidently Friday was one of their birthdays, so there was some family in attendance and a cheesy group photo was posed for from stage during a later Joan of Arc number.  The Love of Everything was a reasonable proposition.  There was a great deal of sequencer frippery underpinning many of the songs, which filled them out nicely.  The tendency for one particular sequencer loop to manifest itself again and again led one concertgoer to threaten violence against the performers should he hear it again, but variety was the order of the day and no bones were broken.  Make Believe are a new Tim Kinsella-fronted band whose membership is essentially coterminous with that of Joan of Arc.  Make Believe are furthermore much better than Joan of Arc has been in a while, exhibiting more of the chunky rockiness of  How Memory Works -era JoA than the later stuff.  The songs were faster, and the playing and singing were more together than the Joan of Arc performance which was to follow, but you can probably chalk that up to some of the band having been on stage for two hours already by the start of their set.  Joan of Arc were also better than Joan of Arc have been in a long time, although they could have been better.  If you, like me, were one of the seven people still patient enough to actually buy  In Rape Fantasy And Terror Sex We Trust  then you'll know what you could have expected.  The first part of the set was good, but by the middle of the seemingly-infinite (probably more like fifteen-minute) version of "Shadow Government" (no shit, Tim Kinsella can actually remember  urlLink that entire list  without help) nobody in the now-peaked looking audience would ever mistake Tim's arrogance for shyness ever again.  Joan of Arc, in the later part of their set, showed signs that they are ready to disintegrate into a truly unpleasant folk-percussion based hippie jam ensemble, only without the marijuana;  a pair of new songs played as an encore helped to dispel that suspicion.

       The people here still suck, though.   This Leap Day, Friday the 29th of February, I made certain to catch the Mountain Goats in concert at Bloomington's own Waldron Arts Center for the measly sum of seven dollars American.  Naturally, this show would begin as every other show ever has - no less than an hour and twenty minutes late.  To begin with, the Waldron auditorium is an unusual space, and not really a good one for putting on shows.  The inside of the Arts Center is really nice.  It is so nice that every single one of my fellow indie-rock snobs was reduced to utter silence both inside the auditorium and in the narrow, constrictive lobby.  Fuck, there's a parquet floor.  I think we've all been to shows like this, and can picture them in our heads.  I'll help you out:  Low.  Rachel's.  Ida.  The Red House Painters.  Bright Eyes.  Edith Frost.  Some good, some bad, some fucking lousy, all of them a surefire bet for a no-talking night out.  Now you've got the idea.  Due to the start-time sleight-of-hand (Flyer says show at seven, show up early for tickets.  Man at desk says show at eight, plenty of tickets.) I arrive and walk in at about eight-fifteen, right in the middle of the second band's sound check, like about thirty other people.  The band playing was called Manishevitz, and they are from Chicago.  They were playing Bloomington, because they are on Jagjaguwar records, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Secretly Canadian Corp. (motto:  "Putting Bloomington the fuck to sleep since, oh, 1999 or so.").  Before Jagjaguwar came to Bloomington, they put out records by Oneida.  Now, this.  Manishevitz sound exactly like Chamberlain.  (The existence of Chamberlain, AKA Split Lip, is a conundrum.  Back issues of Skyscraper and Punk Planet are littered with ads for Split Lip/Chamberlain albums.  Some people will insist that this stuff is emo, but  sonically they suggest a jam session of the ten smuggest artists on the Northern Exposure soundtrack deciding to "rock out a little".  If you ask anyone with direct experience of Chamberlain, they will immediately agree that they suck.)  Now, with the time stretching before me, and the opening band now not scheduled until nine, I decided to wander out into the warm February air and go get some coffee, in the process losing my seat.  I returned, with the coffee, fairly early on in the actual opener's set.  Elephant Micah is a one-piece from just north of Louisville.  Like a true Indianan, Elephant Micah manages to be so bland, soft, and unassuming as to be offensive.  A kid I talked to outside said that he had gone to grade school with Elephant Micah, and a preponderance of his songs are about a girl he broke up with in junior high.  This is not surprising.  Next up:  Manishevitz.  My earlier exposure to these ungodly Chamberlain-alikes was enough.  I hung around outside and got pretty good at the Connect Four game on my cellphone.   I went across the street to a cafe that was also a video store and got some more coffee.  More time brought more semi-contact with more semi-acquaintances, one of whom told me that I didn't seem like the sort of person who would be at a Mountain Goats show.  I don't know what that means, exactly.  I have a few Mountain Goats albums, and I enjoy listening to them.  That's pretty much the standard, isn't it?  After Manishevitz finally fucked off I went up and grabbed myself a seat for the Mountain Goats show.  It wasn't too hard because the collected hipster morass had decided to sit on the floor.  The Mountain Goats appeared (with supplementary bassist) wearing a possibly ironic "SOBER" sweatshirt and sat down with a minimum of banter, during which it transpired that, as he was born in Bloomington before moving with his family to California at age nine months, he had decided for this admittedly nonsensical reason to play songs he hadn't been playing this tour.  What this amounted to was a mix of old stuff and stuff off of  We Shall All Be Healed , all of it pretty well-played but sort of marred by the acoustics.   Otherwise, the Mountain Goats' songs benefitted greatly from the live setting.  This judgment may be conditioned by the fact that the Mountain Goats albums that I possess,  Protein Source of the Future. . .Now! ,  Ghana , and  Bitter Melon Farm , are compilations of seven-inches, rarities, and compilation contributions and therefore more lo-fi than the typical offering.    Naturally this wouldn't be a proper TINAFTS post unless it contained the guaranteed minimum of Bloomington-bashing, and tonight provided no shortage.  In particular I am thinking of an exchange between one of the concert-goers and an innocent passerby.  The Manishevitz set had pushed a number of people outside by its sheer mass of Chamberlain-derived suckitude and I was among them.  I was engaged in idle chatter with a group of people, one of which I had recognized from the Black Eyes show I attended in Louisville some time ago ( urlLink q.v. ).  At some point a chirpy young woman in a sport utility vehicle pulls up and asks what kind of music the Mountain Goats were.  "Oh, it's sort of contemporary Christian," comes the answer.  That is uncool.  It's one thing to let the sheer low fidelity and uncoolness of the Mountain Goats drive away the uninitiated.  It is quite another to trick people who may on some off chance enjoy the music into probably going and renting  Jerry Maguire  for the seventeenth time.  I mean, who's to say?  I suspect that this practice of giving phony information to innocent bystanders one deems insufficiently hip is epidemic amongst Louisvillians and has been for the past five years;  it is also the reason that I hate  urlLink the Metroschifter , not as a band but as people.

       In which I fade away into nothingness.   Yesterday was a uneventful day, on the whole, but it is beginning to convince me that I am turning invisible, at least to waitstaff.  Yesterday, for dinner, at around 7:30 pm, I went to Bloomington's own hippie money pit, the  urlLink Jungle Room , located conveniently inside local Trustafarian swill hole Uncle Fester's.  I was intending to get the salad bar, because it's all I could really afford, as I was going to a concert later on, about which more later.  I walked in the front and seated myself, according to Jungle Room protocol.  I sat reading my newly-obtained copy of  Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum  for a few minutes before wondering when I could get my order taken.  The restaurant was most decidedly not busy;  at the time I was the only person in my section, and the majority of the clientele were only there for drinks.  Yes.  At twenty to eight on a Wednesday night, the majority of the clientele were only there for drinks.  In the succeeding few minutes, I would come into view of fully two waitresses, neither of whom could apparently be bothered.  Like I said, all I wanted was the salad bar, so I started to get up and head to the front to just ask to go to the fucking salad bar, please.  At that exact moment some goon from the kitchen walked over to the salad bar and started shutting it down.  Keep in mind that this place is supposed to be open until like three in the morning.  Another thing to bear in mind is that this is the second time that I have been ignored by the worthless trust fund cracker bitch idiots that loaf around that place for more than twenty minutes.  I kept going because it's the only place in Bloomington you can eat vegan for under seven dollars.  As for now, fuck it.  But my odyssey of invisibility does not end there.   urlLink Need New Body  and  urlLink Azita  were reputed by Bloomington's famously vague concert flyers to be playing that night at the  urlLink Second Story .  A flyer-finding expedition, which led me at roughly 9 pm to the doors of the Second Story itself revealed that the doors were to open at 10.  What that flyer also revealed, which I would have done well to heed, was that in addition to the two groups I wanted to see, I would also be treated to the local whiteboy backpack hip-hop sounds of Acebestis.  Returning to the venue at 10, I could see that a long wait was in order.  The degree of onstage fuckaround indicated that the opening band had a lot of shit to fuck around with before they took their half-hour pre-show ganja break.  During this time, I became thirsty.  I went up to the bar, where the bartender, complete with corkscrew permanent and skintight black t-shirt, was evidently involved in a complex discussion of tropical vacations with three idle, superfluous waitresses.  I waited up there for a while, got discouraged, and sat back down.  Later, as the band hadn't yet started and I was now  really  thirsty, I went back up.  Then I sat back down.  Finally, shortly before Acebestis began to pollute the air with their total shitstain of an act, I saw my opening:  there were no tits at the bar with which I would have to compete for the bartender's attention.  I got my water and tipped the asshole a dollar.  You're welcome, asshole.  I had my bookbag with me, and as I sat sipping my water, I tried to read a litte, but the bar was too dark.  I would have to spend the rest of the time before the show with my own thoughts, which, on perusal of this website, you can see are not all that positive.  Mercifully, it was now not long before the show.  Unmercifully, the show was Acebestis.  I proceed first from politeness:  The first few backing tracks that Acebestis used (Bestis, evidently is the DJ, while Ace is the MC) were not bad.  They were fairly decent slices of Dust Brothers/Beastie Boys 70's funk-soul sound collage.  Unfortunately, after that they had to go and get original, and really really bad.  Then there's Ace.  Ace is quite possibly the worst MC ever.  His lyrics are insipid and his flow is nonexistent.  I would like to go out on a very short, very thick limb, one which is very close to the ground, if not actually resting upon it, and suggest that Ace's primary influences as an MC are, in ascending order of importance:  M-1, MC Paul Barman, Del the Funkee Homosapien, Digable Planets, and Kool Keith. Except that most of those people are actually good.  Ace's stilted whiteboy diction fused not at all with his failed attempts at rapping with big words about positivity and social justice, and his obnoxious attempts at introducing poetry-slam-style melismatics and syncopation into his delivery made me want to throw an ashtray at his fucking head, a head which, I might add, sported a back-length growth of hair which he had secured into a samurai-style topknot protruding not from the top of his head, but from about 2 o'clock, if you were to look at him face-on.  Coupled with his starter 'stache and dork glasses, his overall physical impression is that of a backpack Weird Al Yankovic.  Shortly after the beginning of their set Azita, apparently asleep in the back of the bar, woke up and left the room.  I can't blame her.  I myself went down to the street and frantically dialed through my cellphone's address book, killing time before they would just fucking  stop  already in the guise of playing catch-up with friends.  Don't worry, I apprised my friends of their role in the transaction.  Finally they finished and Azita came on.  Her solo stuff, which I had not heard before, is markedly different from her earlier output with  urlLink Scissor Girls .  Whereas that group was largely about DNA-inspired skronk rock whose closest contemporary analogue is probably Erase Errata, Azita solo, if I may continue to play the "sounds like" game, is mining a vein typically visited by Pleasure Forever, Tom Waits, Nick Cave, Marianne Faithfull, and other such  maudits nouveaux .  The Marianne Faithfull resemblance is particularly marked in the vocals.  At times the theatricality of the performance veered into schmaltz, but not for long, and the songs all had an affecting cabaret quality, which probably excuses much of the aforementioned schmaltz as just a precondition of the genre.  I'd like finish up by telling you how the Need New Body performance was, but I can't.  They didn't start until 1:30 in the fucking morning, which is all well and good if you're some Southern Indiana alcoholic layabout who gets drunk on Wednesday afternoon and cuts class whenever the fuck he feels like, but unfortunately I'm not, and I had class in the morning.  I stayed for as long as I could, but they wasted about twenty minutes draping the stage in lamé and so I only got to hear the first two minutes of the first song.  Which, by the way, was a bunch of jerkoff.  Remember  urlLink Bent Leg Fatima ?  I do - they were fucking  good .  Why can't we have them back?  And the first NNB album wasn't too bad either.  Maybe a little overindulgent in parts, but solid;  back then those guys could tell the difference between experimentation and fucking around.  Then again, maybe this is just pissiness because, at 1:30 in the morning, not having eaten since noon, I wasn't in the mood to have to listen to some dude shrieking "I'm building a hogan!" (or something) again and again and again and again and again.

       They typically inspire one to ask, "why did you bother?"   If you asked me to recount for you what the weather and temperature has been here in Bloomington for the past few weeks, I doubt I could do so accurately.  All I can remember is the heat and the sunlight.  Today was another day just like the ones before it:  bright, washed-out, and anodyne.  Already heat is starting to radiate from the macadam.  Now, at night, it's better, but my apartment is still suffused with heat.  If it were winter, and it were just the inside that were like this, it would be "cozy".  But it's everywhere, and it's inescapable.  This is the hottest place I have ever been to for longer than a day that is not also a desert;  while I expect that the farther south one goes from here the foliage becomes even more overpowering, I myself remain disconcerted by what I found here already in late March.   The milk-white flowers that grow on the trees that blanket the area drop their petals at the slightest breeze, so even in this still air the sidewalks are littered with them.  All around these flowers is the revolting smell of an overgrown algae bloom, but the flowers are not the source.  The city planners of Bloomington are kindred spirits of the geniuses who brought us New Orleans, Venice, the Uzbek economy and the Three Gorges Dam;  downtown Bloomington rests in large part  over  the Jordan River, which is visible only far outside of town, and on the IU campus as a shallow, inconveniently-routed creek.  It was claimed to me that the river actually flows in a manmade subterrenean channel through the city.  Probably, the river is carrying agricultural effluvium-enhanced algae downtown, where it clots in the sewers and breeds.  The Jordan River itself is of course named for the Jordan River to be found in the Near East;  like so many other sites within the pre-Civil War pale of Anglo-Welsh Protestant American settlement, Biblical toponyms are borrowed haphazardly, sometimes without regard to the original connotation of the name.  Possibly the people who chose these names were attempting to reinforce their connection to a religious tradition, which they saw as more immediate and relevant to their lives than contemporary events;  possibly they thought that recreating the Israelites' "Promised Land" in metaphorical fashion would highlight nicely their own claim to new land.  Oddly, Central Illinois, with its Cairo and Mahomet, would stand in for medieval Egypt, but the mainstream of the trend is for towns and geographical features like the Jordan River, or like Goshen, Bethlehem, Hebron, or Nineveh, Indiana.  With Southern Indiana's prophesied plague of cicadas currently the subject of much idle speculation, it is easy to suspect that Indiana's Bible-believing elders might have pictured themselves as in a way actually living in a Biblical era.  The other Jordan river empties southward into the Dead Sea near Qumran and is shared by Israel, Palestine, Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan.  In Bible days, the Jordan was used by two Caananite groups, the Philistines and the Phoenecians, both of whom were noted for the worship of a half-man, half-fish divinity called  urlLink Dagon , or Baal-Dagon, who was supposed to live variously in this river, or in the Mediterrenean Sea.  While the River Jordan figures prominently in Judaeo-Christian mythology as well, the chthonic character and overwhelming smell of this new Jordan River reminds one that  urlLink speculation  as to the origin of the Dagon legend is occasionally  au courant .   ADDENDUM:  In honor of this flat, static weather, This is not a Fugazi T-shirt is sponsoring another giveaway.  The first five people to write to  urlLink TINAFTS  describing in no less than a full paragraph the wall directly behind their workspace will receive a free CD stuffed with sixty minutes of songs which I judge to be evocative of an 85-degree windless day in April.

       Coliseum, Angelville, Breather Resist and The Cursed @ The Garage of DOOOM!   I'm pissed.  I'm pissed because right before this show, I realized I didn't have earplugs, and this show was going to be loud with a capital "metal".  I thought fate was smiling on me because as I was standing around shoving little bits of rolled-up paper in my ears, the assorted sound amateurs of the student radio station threw up their hands in exasperation at the recalcitrant PA.  I made the immediate decision to run to CVS.  Normally I don't place such a massive premium on avoiding four hours of tinnitus after a show but one look at the massed amplifiers of the various bands instilled the fear of death in me, and not without reason.  The sheer volume marshalled by each one of the night's bands could have killed an entire regiment of Civil War soldiers.  No guitar I witnessed was amplified by less than two amplifiers.  "This will be quick,"  I thought.  "In and out, no problems."  I had forgotten that a simple drive across Bloomington, despite the fact that the distance spanned is the length of four ashtrays laid end-to-end, takes around twenty minutes.  I returned, earplugs in hand, to find that  urlLink Coliseum  had come and gone.  And that in between they had kicked more ass than a centipede at an ass-kicking contest.  People are still talking about Coliseum, and considering the other bands that played, they had to have been impressive indeed.  Oh well.  Plus side, I managed to sell about eight pairs of surplus earplugs, which defrayed my cost a great deal.  The Coliseum, like Breather Resist, who played third, are from Louisville KY and consist partly of members of  urlLink Black Cross .  Next to play were  urlLink Angelville , who are sort of hometown heroes in Bloomington.  This was their first show back after a catastrophic van accident in which their lead singer's arm was severely injured.  It was also my first time ever seeing Angelville, and without intending any disrespect, I have to say that I don't understand the hype.  These guys put on a good, sincere, high-energy show (after which they still had the energy to support the two remaining bands by freaking out like crazy), but the two tonic notes of their performance are "not quite my thing" and "sounds exactly like a bunch of other stuff that's not quite my thing".  I think it's worth noting here that until I came to Indiana I had never met a Hatebreed fan.  Third were  urlLink Breather Resist , who were most decidedly my thing.  The name "Breather Resist" itself is taken from a hard-to-find Hoover track, but in concert, while the suggestion of Hoover is present, Breather Resist the band are a paralyzingly loud, dissonant rock force of their own design.  Sort of like Hoover, I guess, but faster and more distorted.  One thing I was glad that they were not was metal.  If anything, Breather Resist represent a throwback to an era of hardcore/emo in which metalcore had yet to devour everything in its goddamn path:  they are perhaps the last torchbearers of what Nathan from  urlLink Call Me Lightning  has called "fall-down" bands;  and fall down they do, right after delivering impassioned breathless lectures about social justice.  Last were Toronto, Ontario's The Cursed.  The curse of the Cursed is that of all other Canadians, with the exception perhaps of Godspeed! You Black Emperor and Kevin McDonald - they are too nice to do "evil" convincingly.  They whip up a good head of steam and spew forth a furious semimetal roar, but something about it (possibly road fatigue) kept it from sounding as frantic, as pissed, or as intimidating as a band this loud called "The Cursed" should.

       Tooting my own horn.   This post has a large self-congratulatory component mixed in with the usual griping.  At first I debated with myself whether or not to stoop that low, but then I realized:  This is a  blog .  That's what they're  for .  Today's post is, as usual, a review:   Troll Hallikk, March Through The Streets, & Terremoto @ Some dude's basement   Last things first, Terremoto, while purporting to be a metal band, in fact churn out massive doses of low-energy Don Caballero-baiting math rock.  They are boring to watch and I left after three songs.  Sue me, I was tired.  Terremoto were preceded by March Through The Streets, who, if the name does not give you enough of a hint, are a Spirit-of-'77 punk band.  They're pretty decent, and their guitar solos put most of the songs over where the lyrics fail, and fail they do because they're all about the goddamn "kids".  Nice guys, though.  Opening the set were Troll Hallikk, who rocked.  And I'm not just saying that because they're my band.  See, about a week before, I was hanging out with this guy Rick and some other people, and somebody announced that there was going to be a party at his house the following week.  I immediately offered my services and drafted Rick on drums.  This is not the first time I have jumped the bill with a nonexistent band.  (Several years ago the Heshers were visited on an unsuspecting New Year's Eve party in identical fashion.)  The Troll Hallikk brief is this:  Spirit-crushing, stoned-out doom metal sung in Norwegian and played by two straight edge dudes.  By the time of the show, we had worked up four songs (enough, in Doom Metal World, for a full 45-minute set, but we economized), the titles of which are "Vi må flykte fra ulvene" ("We must flee from the wolves"), "Todd fra 7-11 er ondets kong" ("Todd from the 7-11 is the king of evil"), "Satans bil er jævla søt" ("Satan's car is fucking sweet"), and "Jeg elsker min lille katten" ("I love my kitty-cat").  The name Troll Hallikk itself is a stupid pun, but the only part you'll need to know is that it means "Troll Pimp".  How good were we?  We were good enough, evidently, that within five minutes of the end of our set we had recruited, without my knowledge, two new vocalists.  Never mind that I wasn't consulted.  Never mind that neither of them can speak fucking Norwegian, and therefore cannot sing the fucking songs.  Never mind that a bassist, or maybe a second guitarist, would have been a more appropriate addition.  Also, apparently we got asked to play another show.

       In which a brief anthropological expedition results in a few pat judgments.   The headline states it quite simply:  My nightlife is a shambles.  The reason for this is that I have fallen in, as is my tendency, with others who share my no-fun stance on beverages.  This would not be so much of a problem, except that one of them is banned for life from the one bar any of us would consider frequenting, ironically for attempting to sneak in an underaged patron who is herself straight-edge.  The result of this is that my weekend nights, rather than involving any kind of social activity, tend to revolve around  Law & Order  reruns.  Not to dis  Law & Order , of course.  Jerry Orbach is, in my opinion, one of the finest actors working today and were I a  urlLink Chicago resident , I would have voted for him at least two more times than I did already.  It's just that there's only so much interest to be squeezed out of the tube.  Plus, I think that  SVU  is starting to warp my mind.  So tonight I decided to make the rounds of the various locals.  Because bar time here is 3 AM, it was no difficulty to observe all of the main watering holes in full swing between 11 PM and 1 AM.  By now you've probably realized you're in for another "Bloomington sucks and here's how" post, and here's how this one is going to work:  I've realized that Bloomington's main problem is that it is square as fuck.  It is so square that were my mother to visit, she would doubtless qualify as one of the Top Ten Most "Metal" Individuals Ever In Bloomington.  In an effort to quantify how square it is, I am going to give a rundown of Bloomington's most popular bars and the most analogous Madison bar, since the core readership of this blog (Hi, Core Readership!) is most familiar with those bars.  Ahem.    urlLink  Nick's English Hut   - Brothers.    urlLink  Kilroy's   - Stillwaters.    urlLink  Kilroy's Sports   - Madhatters.    urlLink  Club Axis   - that one shitty meatmarket club under the Church Key.    urlLink  the Irish Lion   - Monday's, but with food.    urlLink  Scotty's   - the Angelic without the reggae.    urlLink  The Bluebird   - the Angelic without the food.    urlLink  the Vertigo   - the Annex.    urlLink  Rhino's   - the New Loft.    the Upstairs Pub  - Bullfeather's, but inside the Church Key.    urlLink  Bullwinkle's   - midway between the Rainbow Room and the Cardinal.    urlLink  the Second Story   - probably the only truly unique place in Bloomington, but not in a particularly positive way.  Seems to compare closely with what I've heard about Merlin's.   And now we come to the centerpiece of my claim,  urlLink  the Video Saloon  , aka "The Vid".  Based on earlier descriptions I have until recently persisted in thinking of the Video Saloon as Bloomington's answer to the Paradise.  Today, though, it struck me that this was extremely inaccurate.  The Paradise has way more heshers and a better jukebox.  The Vid has way more bar games and a larger contingent of slumming Greeks.  Oh fuck living here has compelled me to use the expression "Greek" to describe fratboys.  Therefore, the more accurate analogy would be with the Plaza.  You will note above therefore a total absence of any analogue or even near-analogue to the Madison bars that make life bearable.  There is no 'Dise, no Genna's, and no Mickey's.  No Nick's or Paul's or Stage Door. There is not even a god damned Silver Dollar or a Lava Lounge.  The only nighttime activities in this town involve shotglasses and quarters.

       Aber meistens nur in Indiana.   Today as I was walking home for lunch some fratboy nearly ran me down at an intersection.  He was clearly in the wrong;  he had a stop sign which he failed to heed, unlike the person making the left turn who was at the stop sign as I entered the intersection.  He came on me fast enough for me to stare into his glassy eyes, which were set into a doughy face framed by stringy blond hair. Jumping out of his way, I gave him the finger and told him to "watch where the fuck [he's] going!"  Simple shit.  I like to think that when people who run stop signs and only narrowly avoid committing murder wind up only getting the finger they would be relieved an accept some well-deserved chastisement.  Of course, that's because I'm pretty fucking nave.  No, as I continued home the guy came up behind me, having circled through a few blocks trying to find me, slowed down, and yelled "FAGGOT!"  I am fucking sick of being called a faggot.  In the seven years I lived in Madison, I was never called a faggot.  Here in  urlLink Bumblefuck, Indiana  on the other hand it happens about once every three weeks.  And while there's not a "pattern" per se, there are a few features which distinguish etiquette here in the great state of Indiana.  Only call a person a faggot if a) you outnumber them by at least five to one, and are on foot after nightfall;  or b) you are in a car and are able to speed away scot-free.  Who is a faggot?  A person is a faggot who is not clearly a member of a fraternity, or who you simply decide that you do not like.  It is my opinion that here in Bloomington, a city which I hate more with every passing minute, this sort of behavior is promoted by two factors:  First, in Indiana the average license plate has around nine characters, and is only displayed in the back.  These license plates are nearly illegible under the best of circumstances.  Second, Indiana gays are insufficiently armed.

       Apparently not just hype.   You may recall that I have already  urlLink reported  on certain aspects of contemporary Indiana which it holds in common with Iron Age Palestine.  You will also be aware of the recent publicity given in the national press to "Brood X", a massive infestation of cicadas which recurs only once every seventeen years, and which supposedly will fill the skies with a thick black curtain of buzzing insectoid monstrosities, and that while not strictly speaking locusts, Brood X's appearance 34 years ago was the inspiration for the Bob Dylan song "Day of the Locust".  Yesterday morning I was walking to the student union where I usually read when it occurred to me that I had yet to see any cicadas.  At first I was somewhat disappointed.  I began to toy with the idea of just lying to people from out of town, concocting a Biblical plague out of whole cloth.  Naturally I would see my first cicada within five minutes of having that thought.  Right now it seems as though the cicadas are limiting themselves to shadier, more arboreal areas, but there has been a marked increase in their numbers already since yesterday morning.  Although living cicadas are numerous, the two most prevalent cicada-related sights are these:  empty, transparent brownish molted exoskeletons sticking to trees;  and most commonly, the thick black patina of crushed cicada which lines most sidewalks that pass through forested areas on campus.  Ignoring for the moment that there are "forested areas" on "campus" in this backwater, this is astounding.  As a nonnative, I have no choice at this point but to begin to lend full credence to newspaper accounts, and I will be buying a dust mask forthwith.

       We don't morally censure, we just want the money.   As you will glean from the previous posting today I went to the local chain bookstore and to the movies, where I saw Lars von Trier's  Dogville .  In general, it seems to me that von Trier does better when he's trying to make a point or experiment with cinematic form (cf.  Zentropa ) rather than fussing over his  jvla dogme ;  this movie, which assumes the mood of a Depression-era WPA agitprop play with a highly stylized set and mannered acting, is his most engaging in years.  The bookstore near the theater is, like most bookstores these days, probably about half-filled with extreme right-wing polemics decrying the Reds who control every movie studio, newsroom, and publishing house in America.  One of the less histrionic,  urlLink Spin Sisters  by Myrna Blyth, holds that violence against women is a myth propagated to make women vote Democratic.  Of course there are the typical Sean Hannity/Ann Coulter screeds, as well as the bittersweet memoirs of John Stossel, whose evil Liberal bosses forced him to go after hucksters who just wanted to make an honest living rather than the evil Democrats who were hellbent on selling this nation a bill of goods.  Oh, and did you know that Jimmy Carter coddles dictators?  In all fairness of course these are really the only examples;  like I said, the other half of the books in stock are all written by card-carrying pinkos.  Like the Lonely Planet guidebooks.  Those people are  totally  Stalin apologists.  Of course the easiest place to uncover the Socialist boogeyman has always been the motion-picture industry;  my Senator and yours Tailgunner Joe McCarthy knew it as well as we do, even if his estimation of the proportion of Communists and Social Democrats to right-thinking Americans was distorted by living in the People's Republic of Wisconsin, so well-known as a Red breeding ground that it merits mention in Lorne Michaels comedies;  hell, my Grandma is farther left than some people I know in the Bay Area.  It is therefore with apologies at the heavy-handedness (I may as well bring up that "Hitler is the only man in Germany who is not allowed to speak" Nazi propaganda cartoon from the '30s just to get it out of the way now) of the following that I turn your attention to one of the works of Fritz Lang, best-known as the director of  urlLink  M   and the near-director of  urlLink  Das Kabinett des Dr. Caligari  .  Instigators of highbrow consumerism  extraordinaire  The Criterion Collection (have to explain  urlLink this , though) have just released a big-ass must-have edition of Lang's  urlLink  Das Testament des Dr. Mabuse   (these German Expressionists really seem to have it in for doctors, don't they?).  The central conceit of  Das Testament  is that Nazi slogans are used as the insane, diabolical Dr. Mabuse's own.  The movie explicitly connects the Nazis (who at this point remember had not reached a position to annihilate six million people) with an evil madman.  Suppose that a filmmaker today were to take a similar, similarly clear moral and political stance, indicting a political figure's statements by running them to their fitting conclusion.  Suppose that filmmaker were a leftist.  That filmmaker would be crucified in the media and on the stateroom floor, and that movie would never get made.  Not for seven figures and points, anyway.  That movie gets made for four figures and it gets shown in public twice.  Lars von Trier's  urlLink  Dogville   has been widely criticized as  urlLink anti-American (subscription required; relevant quotation  urlLink here ; not too widely though, as the fantastically rightist  urlLink Chicago Tribune  seemed to like it) due largely to the fact that it is a movie made by a Dane in which Americans behave badly.  The fact that the movie, rather than being an accessible Hollywood blockbuster, was made in Sweden on a black soundstage with no "sets" per se for US$10M is probably solely responsible for the relative weakness of the public outcry.  The charges of anti-Americanism appear to stem as much from the closing montage of impoverished Americans from the Thirties to the present, accompanied by David Bowie's "Young Americans" as from the narrative itself which in conjunction with the aforementioned extreme stylisms appears to purport to be something singularly "American".  In von Trier's defense, it seems as though in his non-Dogme movies like this one,  Dancer in the Dark , and  Zentropa , the stylisms, plot, and moral (and with von Trier there's always a moral) are independent elements that are simply combined almost haphazardly as a sort of experiment in order to ground a general statement in a specific place, which paradoxically lends it an air of universal validity (because of apparent specific validity).   Dancer in the Dark , for example, has been related to von Trier's criticisms of the rights of immigrants  to Denmark , despite its being set like  Dogville  in the United States.  Despite the superficial Kafkaesque material, nobody can claim that  Zentropa  is a uniquely German (or Czech) story in the way that is happening with Dogville.  Another well-publicized current in von Trier's work is his real or supposed misogyny.  Widely-circulated reports of his psychological torture of Bjrk on the set of  Dancer in the Dark  dovetail nicely in the public's psychological profile of a screenwriter known for heaping torment after sadistic torment on the heads of his selfabnegating female protagonists.  I have my doubts;  the Norwegian in me would suggest that perhaps von Trier's maltreatment of Bjrk is borne less from misogyny than from the inborn Danish imperialist pig impulse to oppress other Scandinavians, and additionally although admittedly I have done little investigation into the subject there does not seem to be an invariant pattern of maltreatment of starring actresses in von Trier pictures.  Trier may well be a misogynist, but here the femininity of the protagonist, Grace, is less because of von Trier's desire to show a woman being degraded than because it denotes and renders more plausible her vulnerability to the quasi-state violence of the townspeople of Dogville.  The truly satisfying  denouement (YES I AM A PRETENTIOUS FUCK.  FUCK YOU, JACK.  YOU WANT AW SHUCKS/GEE WHIZ GO READ  urlLink AIN'T IT COOL NEWS ) of the movie betrays it, whatever the director's own inclination might be, as not an anti-American screed (an inherently leftist pursuit, evidently, these days) but an assault upon liberal values as they might be constructed by someone only slightly less hostile to the viewpoint that Bill O'Reilly.    Dogville  due to its length is the sort of movie on which one can reflect while it is still in progress.  As such, there was a point about halfway through when I projected for myself all the various ways in which this movie could end and not ring completely false.  A "happy ever after" sort of ending could be completely ruled out, as could one in which the heroine dies.  That was von Trier's last picture, and at any rate it would require the other characters to behave with a level of heroism or melodramatic villainy which none of them possessed, and which the narrative could not license them.  I admit that I am bragging when I guessed, quite early on, the correct general idea of the movie's ending, which I confirmed and fleshed out when the townspeople called the gangsters who had chased Grace to Dogville:  The Mob boss is Grace's father or lover and when he arrives in Dogville all of the townspeople will die bad deaths.  The ending of the movie justifies all of the horrors the script visits upon Grace, to the point that I guarantee you that you will be quite gratified to see an infant machine-gunned, and not entirely against yourself.  The violent catharsis at the end of the movie serves two purposes:  first of all, it expiates for the viewers the litany of sadism they have been forced to endure through Grace for the preceding three hours, and second, it serves as the illustration (for this refer to the movie) of the moral, which is set out in the dialogue between Grace and her kingpin father.  Von Trier has ironically elected to convey the message of the movie through a gangster, one of American cinema's most immoral mainstays;  ironically, except of course that the conflicted, moral underworld figure is almost more common in American movies than his more realistic, sociopathic variant. In his analysis Grace has allowed herself to become the victim of all of these vicious acts precisely because she refuses to judge their perpetrators, forgiving them as products of their environment.  The moral relativism causing her to forgive repeated rape and constant dehumanization is identical to the sort of moral and cultural relativism espoused by Western leftist intellectuals and decried by their conservative counterparts who accuse them of being apologists for this and that.  With her execution-style killing of her erstwhile lover Thomas, her most subtle and egregious oppressor, she makes a full conversion to her father's viewpoint in such a way that indicates where the filmmaker's own sensibilities lie;  in  Dogville  the ultimate solution is violence in the service of moral censure.  Comfortingly, however, this movie's central charge will never be picked up and carried by those most sympathetic to it.  Try convincing your average conservative pundit that any European isn't a Socialist.  As far as anyone in a position to benefit from the propaganda use of this film is concerned, it's just another arthouse flick trying to run down the good ol' US of A agin.

       A report from the front lines   Recently I went to see a godawful VH1-ready "indie rock" band called Malbec ("after the grapes my grandfather grows in his vineyards in Argentina".  Fuck you Little Lord Fauntleroy.  We already have one The Strokes. Maybe you've heard of them?  They're called Kula Shaker) at a basement show.  It was vulgar and annoying, not least because of the oh-so-very LA-ness of the whole thing.  Malbec are from Hollywood, and you can tell.  They sound like a teen soap opera producer's take on Chicago post rock circa 2002.  Plus, the crowd sucked.  Not least because some filthy  hippie who smelled like he had just shit his pants kept shoving an open bottle of vodka direclty under my nose.  It made me wish I were the sort of person who shoves people.  That is not the point of today's post, however.  Today, in the interest of making conversation, I have decided to embark on an expedition into the heart of  urlLink Friendster .  For this expedition,  urlLink your hero  carries no provisions and no equipment but his usually trusty laptop, which for some reason however is currently refusing to delete an inadvertently saved picture of a friend of his  urlLink eating soup in France .  The setup is thus:  I have elected to search through my entire  urlLink gallery  which has not been limited with respect to the gender, age, status, location, or degree of distance of the profiles, and report on what I find there.    Page Three :  I am beginning to become disturbed by how similar people look.  Also suspect that there is a flaw inherent in computer keyboards marketed to Southeast Asia which causes THe shIfT KEy tO rANdomLY eNgaGE anD DISENgaGe.     Page Twenty-Three :  Coincidentally also line five.  This is the twenty-fifth man I have seen with the  urlLink same haircut .    Page Twenty-Nine :  ThElizabeth's  urlLink evil twin .    Page Thirty-One :  At this point the rate of appearance of ironic fake mullet pictures is about one every three pages.  They're all pretty much the same.  You probably have a friend who is using one right now.  Go look at that one, they're all basically the same.  Mullets.    Page Thirty-Eight :  First phony  urlLink celebrity profile .    Page Thirty-Nine :  urlLink The First Ave.   Added.    Page Forty-One :   urlLink Kidding?  I can't fucking tell.    Page Forty-One , Part II:  The Friendster gallery Bloomington, IN has a marked dearth of women over the age of twenty-two who do not listen to country and collect those little pastel ceramic figurines of toddlers praying.  They seem to have all gone to Holland.    Page Forty-Three :  Unfortunately,  urlLink this guy  is kidding.    Page Forty-Four :   urlLink This  is every single girl on Friendster.  Yes, she's you too.  I'm sorry.    Page Forty-Six :  First appearance of surreptitiously uploaded quasi-real  urlLink porn .  Also first appearance of a yawning or coughing girl whose head is coated in an inch of Vaseline.  Bravo, Joanne.    Page Fifty :  The First Ave seems to have accepted my friend request, throwing off the calibration of the pages, as some people are reappearing.  PS:  urlLink Fuck you, hippie .    Page Fifty-Nine :   urlLink Starscream !    Page  Sixty-Five :  Hipster uses  urlLink veneer of fake pathetic loserdom  to conceal actual pathetic loserdom.    Page Sixty-Seven :  A person who seems vaguely  urlLink familiar  at first turns out to be a total stranger but a (possibly former) coworker of a former coworker of mine who is not on Friendster.    Page Seventy-Two :   urlLink Number fifty  of the other generic male hipster look.    Page Ninety-Nine :  Evidently the limit of the Friendster universe is 99 pages.  The last profile I am shown is  urlLink this winner .  I have endured this long trek through the wastelands of Friendster without once running across anybody I actually know.  Today's experience was like visiting other people's highschool reunions:  lots of strangers, lots of superficial information gleaned, lots of snap judgments made.    Ah, snap judgments.  Here in the real world, I have developed a game.  Considering that time is running out on my ill-starred sojourn here in southern Indiana, graveyard of good taste, and with it any chance to form any lasting acquaintanceships, I threw out my scruples against "judging a book by its cover" so to speak.  Now, as I walk or drive around I try to formulate unflattering opinions of people as soon as possible, without repeats.  My record is 20 in one minute.  You might say that this makes me a bad person, but you're wrong.  Selling liquor to degenerate morons for a year made me a bad person.  This is just an expression of my lack of character.  It's not like it really matters anyway.   EPILOGUE :  Returning to the Gallery, I find it's different every time.  Now I can recognize some of the people I ran across last time, and what's worse I can conceptualize their chain of acquantanceship with respect to myself.  I still haven't found anybody I know, though.

       Ghost to Falco & Russian Tsarcasm @ Boxcar Books   The bill for today's show at Boxcar Books, Bloomington's leftist bookstore, actually also included DJ Sony Playstation, but I cut out early to go watch  Timeline .  Man, that Billy Conolly.  First up was Russian Tsarcasm, who, with a partial drumkit and a single guitar, manage to destroy the notion that it's impossible to recognize "good" avant-garde noise rock.  Because you can tell this isn't.  Fifteen minutes of steady pounding by an individual who was previously only known to me as a really good shoplifter, followed by one minute of guitar scree by a guy wearing acoustic dampening foam like a cape.  How this received more than polite applause is beyond me, truly.  They were followed by Ghost to Falco, from Portland, OR.  This is certainly a daring choice for a band name, because even with their 7" sitting in front of me I have to keep referring back to it to get it right.  Since shortly before the show started at 8 pm I have referred to them as "Ghost vs Pilot", "Pilot to Bombardier", and other assorted permutations thereof.  There is probably a reason for this.  A one-piece, Ghost to Falco bear a strong sonic resemblance to various 555 Recordings groups like Hood and Halkyn;  the principal difference being that Ghost to Falco are far less wilfully messy than Hood, and less folkish than Halkyn.  The crowd sucked, as always.

       And teach it to sing.  Sabbath.   It's a new commercial;  at any rate, it's a commercial I haven't seen before.  The only TV I watch is prerecorded episodes of Law & Order, courtesy of friends with cable, so all this means is that it came out after say 1999.  That said, I doubt it gets aired on TV.  I saw it at the local multiplex, and various clues indicate that it is probably intended exclusively for that context.  The advertisement appears to be shot in Cinemascope.  It does not suffer from the odd distension or cropping that mark TV crossover ads, such as the Celine Dion Chrysler spot or the innumerable interchangeable Mountain Dew ads.  The action virtually spills out from around the spot's centerpiece, a telegenic young black singer.  As soon as this woman starts to sing, it becomes clear both from the structure of the melody and the simple fact of her unaccompanied singing that this is a Coca-Cola spot, part of the series whose first iteration was the venerable "I'd Like To Teach The World To Sing".  The surface message of that spot as well as this and all the others in between is essentially that guileless young people are going to improve the world with their enthusiasm and idealism, whilst drinking Coke.  The form has arguably found its apotheosis in this latest attempt.  The frame is composed such that the singer is always in the center of the frame and larger than life, while the people, ostensibly citizens of New York City, with whom she interacts fall into and fade out of view as she passes by them.  The singer appears magnified, and her every facial expression is likewise magnified.  Her range of expression however is profoundly limited:  varying between vulnerable innocence and quasi-cosmic wisdom, she could not have forced more boundless love for audience through the camera and into the theater had she used some sort of tool.    Wandering through downtown, she passes out old-school tall glass Coke bottles and meaningful gazes.  One or the other, or the combination, apparently induces life-changing epiphanies in the recipients.  The most priceless expression is on the face of the first one, a young businessman with a trendy haircut.  The amount of treacle is staggering.  It is so staggering that I almost started to wonder whether or not the director of the spot was deliberately going overboard in an attempt to satirize the "Coke and Idealism" ad genre.  Before that, however, I realized that there was no need to wonder:  this was certainly the case.  It is now a given that advertisements, particularly those aimed at young college-educated or collegiate adults will include a degree of self-referentiality or -deprecation to reassure the marketing-savvy that they have indeed seen an advertisement, how hokey, right?  but you're clever, you're cool, you're in on the joke.  Ultimately the content of an advertisement is window dressing.  Advertisements promote sales mainly by notifying consumers of the simple existence of a product;  the presence of actors or context for the product to identify it with or assign it to the use of a particular demographic or socioeconomic class is basically a shortcut around the step in which you go down to the carlot and discover you can't afford a Lexus.  Back to our ad.  The way in which the director has seen fit to restore some credibility to this ad, to let all us hip young 'uns in on the joke, to let us know that yep, wow, it's an ad! is to take the sentimentality inherent in this type of Coke advertising to an obscene degree.  The tight focus on the singer's face, her earnest demeanor, even her neo-soul clothes and vocal stylisms are all meant to stand in for sincerity, as they currently do in the media in general.  Everybody in the ad, once their lives are touched by the Coke Lady, is clearly resolving to live life in a better, simpler way.  But with Coke.  The cognitive dissonance induced when one realizes that a visual rhetoric of idealism is being used to shill for materialism is nearly disorienting.  The idea that someone could watch this ad and  not  be struck by the degree of cynical manipulation it entails is ridiculous.  Essentially what this ad represents is the total dominance in the professional ad world of the "ironic in-joke" trope.  It has now joined the legion of tricks advertisers use to try to sell things to people who think they're above such things.  In this, it has discredited itself.  Wow, again with the no clicking.  Well then, time for more  urlLink funny .

       I'm still exhausted, and I think I have the flu.   This weekend was perhaps the most bizarre of my life.  For significant portions of it I was nearly convinced that I was on Candid Camera, or one of its more meanspirited new-school MTV successors.  I got to see a bunch of good shows, and I missed an equal number.  I hung out with Norwegians.  I pulled a Sarah and disappeared for several hours.  And to top it all off, I walked fifteen miles from 2:30 AM to 6:00 AM, wandering southwest Indiana along I-74 looking for a gas station in the mistaken (yes, mistaken) belief that I had run out of gas while napping at a rest stop.  There were opossums and dogs.  Fortunately the only injuries I sustained were the blisters I gave myself by running the two miles between Lizton and Pittsboro in Chuck Taylors.  If you want anything clearer than this, you need to call me.  I do not have the energy to recount the events in the detail they truly require just now.  Oh, and then on Monday after I got back to Bloomington an 87-year-old man clipped me with his car trying to fit it into a space narrower than said car at around fifteen over the speed limit.  Then he tried to lie to a cop about it.

       Uh, what?   I got a hit on this page from someone doing a Yahoo! search on "the picture about girl does not wear shirt".  Say what you will about amputated fingers, that doesn't even make fucking  sense .  I also got multiple hits from people Googling "Aaron Vold", possibly Aaron Vold himself.

       In which hipsterism devours its children.   Yesterday I was rolling down the street in the passenger seat of my friend Ryan's heavily chopped Geo Metro.  Ahead of us on the sidewalk was a girl wearing the sort of hipster attire fairly common in the world today, but fairly rare in Bloomington.  As such, I naturally took an interest.  She had fashionably short hair with a wide nonelastic Mary Quant/Audrey Hepburn-style print headband, an unseasonable old-school ski vest, and a knee-length skirt of a current cut.  However, as we passed her, the "girl" was revealed to be sixty, maybe sixty-five years old.  Later, as Ryan and I were waiting for the title to the scooter he had bought a few weeks ago we saw her passing by again, confirming our original diagnosis that she was indeed dressed like a record-store employee or fine art major.  I thought maybe she was just in town for the sold out Modest Mouse/Walkmen show that night (tickets were going for up to $560 the pair on eBay), but of course Ryan was too chickenshit to go over and ask her.  This, people, is the danger that the fashion-forward recovering highschool social exile must be ever vigilant against, particularly as it relates to "retro" fashion.  Remember that when you revive a fashion trend, particularly in an ironic manner, there are still people who wear that fashion, unironically, as though it had never ceased to be current;  the mullet is the most salient case in point here.  Folks, when you grow an ironic mullet, you run the risk of either offending, or even worse impressing, people with straight-faced mullets.  This is why I personally have elected to revive the characteristic flop hairstyle of the Weimar dandy (think  Swing Kids , the movie not the band).  There aren't a lot of people alive anymore who had it, and the ones who did probably have interesting stories.  I am not joking, send me a digital camera and you can have pictures.

       Rebecca de Mornay was probably busy.   The other day at the movies I saw a preview for a movie called  Collateral , in which Jamie Foxx is posited as the next Denzel Washington, right down to the pencil mustache and eyelid tic standing in for everyman modesty.  At issue however is his costar.  First time you see Tom Cruise, he sits down in Jamie Foxx's cab and introduces himself;  it sounds for all the world like he's saying "I'm Goodson."  As in the main character in  Risky Business .  So as the preview progresses with lots of gunplay, threats, and moral ambiguity I'm thinking how damn clever it was to make today's silver-haired assassin the same character as yesterday's amateur brothelkeeper.  Very heavy-handedly moralistic, but still clever.  Clearly Tom Cruise is playing the same character in both films:  same mannerisms and oily chumminess.  Then I see the same preview at a different movie and realize he said "I'm Vincent", and that what was actually happening is Tom Cruise has played the same character in every movie he's been in since 1980.

       If you had recognized that, you would know it's the emo-est reference in the world, even without the gratuitous period.   You would also have been misled into believing that this post is about the  urlLink hal al-Shedad  in any more than an oblique fashion.  It is in fact partly autobiographical, and partly about Unwound.  Lately I have been listening to  urlLink Unwound  a lot, in particular their last album,  Leaves Turn Inside You .  It's a really atmospheric album - it's suffused with a stillness or coldness that other Unwound albums lack.  Someone please review my other posts and let me know if I overuse the word "suffused".  I realized, or decided, or it occurred to me, that it would make for ideal beach listening, with the caveat that the beach is on Lake Superior and it's after October 7th.  Because I enjoy feeling miserable, I think it would be a ripping good time to listen to the album, lying in the scrub, staring alternately up at the grey sky and across at the grey waves and pining.  As soon as I had this thought, I realized that I don't really have anyone to pine over at present, and so I'm kind of screwed.  The most "on point" of you are noticing that this is what the hal al-Shedad reference in the title relates to.  The rest of you are going to have to resign yourselves to ignorance, because I believe, as I hope you do, that quoting emotional hardcore lyrics in a blog when you're not explicitly discussing them is the height of  gaucherie .  Yes I'm making up words in French now.  For most of what I guess I have to consider my "adult" life, I've been making myself miserable over this or that girl, but since getting over it the last time about ten months ago I haven't really latched on to a new source;  I believe that my enjoyment of music has suffered for it.  There's something about being 25 and miserable that really spices up quality rock music.  Not everything benefits from the self-pity factor.  It really works for the last Unwound album.  Early Modest Mouse.  Sebadoh.  My Bloody Valentine.  Other stuff, not really.  Self-pity doesn't add much to "Rock With You", for example.  Regular old self-pity doesn't seem to help the listening experience, unfortunately.  I have that in spades.  Your thesis going nowhere doesn't make "You Never Should" any more poignant.  Your thesis going nowhere is really more of a Converge-friendly kind of self-pity.  No, romantically-based self-pity is the No. 4 heroin of self-pities, because it's uncontaminated by fear and heavily laced with base longing.  Therefore I would like to end this post with an appeal:  If you are a woman between the ages of 22 and 29, who wouldn't mind toying with my affections for a few months, send me a message.  Geographic distance is not a problem, and it really doesn't matter if you already have a boyfriend.  My record collecton and I thank you in advance.  Holy shit I am a whiny fuck.  I am such a whiny fuck, in fact, that I only added that last bit so people would comment in, reassuring me that I am not really that whiny of a fuck.  So let's hear it, people.

       Ladies and gentlemen, the best personals site ever.    I am talking about  urlLink Iranian Personals.com .  This is the only site I have ever seen that as part of the whole "personal profile" process, asks you your opinion of Mohammed Mossadegh. And then, and this is the really weird part, twenty-year-olds give you their opinion of Mohammed Mossadegh.

       So I may as well go whole hog and complain about politics.   The problem I'm having lately is with the near-total inability of the United States government to sort out its paranoid pipe dreams from reality, particularly as it relates to the Middle East.  It is clear to me that whoever it is that's in charge of making up plausible new security threats to scare small children with has never picked up a history book.  The first thing to happen of course was the "collaboration" between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda.  Makes sense, I guess.  He's an Arab, they're Arabs, they're all Sunni Muslims.  The link between them is obvious.  I should never have let my vision become clouded by irrelevancies such as the fact that al-Qaeda's ostensible goal is the destruction of secular regimes and the imposition of Shari`a, whereas Saddam Hussein represents an aggressively secularist police state.  No problem there.  And you know who else is clearly cooperating with al-Qaeda?  Iran.  Muslims are Muslims, right?  In 1997 and 1998 in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda allies the Taliban execute from nine to eleven Iranian diplomats, probably for the sin of subscribing to Shi`ism.  The Taliban are known to have promoted sabotage activities inside Iran at this point.  Long before this, Shah Ismail (1501-24) made Shi`ism the state religion of Iran, thereby differentiating it religiously from the surrounding Sunni areas.  He expanded his boundaries to far west of those of present-day Iran to include some territory which had originally been part of the Sasanian Empire before the Arab Conquest; the population of this region, called "Iraq", is currently majority Arab Shi`ite.  Most contemporary Iranians view the Arab Conquest rather ambivalently;  on one hand it brought them as a nation to their current religious persuasion, on the other the Arabs are viewed as nomadic invaders who demolished an already millenia-old civilization.   This attitude is not new.  The first Arab of note to appear in the  Shhnme  of Ferdsi, the Iranian national epic, is the mythical king Azi Dahhag, who had two snakes sprouting out of his shoulders each requiring the fresh brain of one Iranian boy daily for nourishment, and who reigned for one thousand years before being defeated.  The Arab Conquest of the Sasanian Empire was effected by the Arabs' invasion and occupation of the Sasanian capital city,  Ctesiphon.  The city of Ctesiphon had been founded after the Alexandrian conquest in the vicinity of Babylon and served as the capital not only of the Sasanian Dynasty, but also the earlier Parthian Dynasty.  The nearest contemporary city of note to Ctesiphon is Baghdad, whose name is itself indicative of a Persian origin.  So of course it is perfectly natural that the Iranian government would be perfectly happy to provide cooperation and/or safe passage to the cohorts of a group which had in recent memory killed around ten of its diplomats.  Especially if that group is radical in its agitation for a kind of religion which identifies Iran's brand of religion as capitally heretical.  Sure.  And nothing would please the Iranians more than if, by granting these Sunni terrorists free passage, probably even to the city where their ideological forbears murdered the son-in-law and two grandsons of the Prophet, whom Shi`ites regard as the rightful fourth, fifth, and sixth Caliphs of Islam;  I'll bet the Iranians would be tickled pink that a bunch of Wahhabis would get to run around, attempting to assert control over or sabotage or terrorize a region where the majority of the population are members of the same heresy (in the Wahhabi view) as the Iranians themselves.  Yeah, that makes a whole lot of sense.  Because they're all Muslims, you know?  So they must be in it together.  PS The Czar was totally a fuckin' Bolshevik.

       Some people are saying that this is a dick move.   I am currently executing phase three of my brilliant plan to overpower about ten people with nostalgia.  Phase One involved sitting around, coming up with the ultimate 90s hardcore triple bill.  After some deliberation, the admittedly somewhat anachronistic triad of the hal al-Shedad, Still Life, and Struggle got the nod.  In retrospect I probably should have gone with Portraits of Past instead of the hal al-Shedad, but it's too late now damn it.  The only background you really need on any of those bands is that Portraits of Past are now the Vue, and the lead singer of Struggle is now in the Locust.  And that none of the groups on the bill are capable of any artistic stance but obnoxiously earnest moral certainty.  Phase Two is when I made a suitably amateurish ballpoint-on-notebook-paper flyer for the fictitious show, indicating that it is to take place on August 5th at a house which, I am told, was Bloomington's house-show central in 1996, and took the flyer to the supermarket, making about seven copies.  Phase Three properly started at around eleven pm when I handed off the first of the flyers to a bunch of teenage hipster types lugging their skateboards through the supermarket.  Their response, astonishingly, was "is this  the  Still Life?"  I would have expected the h.a.s. to have been the band with the most lasting impact; moreover as you now know for certain Struggle has one of the guys from the Locust.  But no.  Still Life.  Kids.  Phase Three will continue momentarily as I put up the remaining flyers downtown as soon as I finish posting this.  Phase Four (provisional) will take place, should I choose to bother, on the day of the show, when I might just go over to where the show is supposed to happen and watch the four people who cared enough to show up get really disappointed.  And yeah, this is probably a really shitty thing to do to people, but a) it's not going to affect enough people to matter; b) it's late and I'm bored; and c) fuck all y'all if you can't take a little joke.

      To blog or not to blog or to keep a secret blog.  I'm making the call out here:  Secret blogs are the suck.    If you want a  private  typed record of your thoughts, for whatever reason, buy  Word Perfect  or  Word 2000  (Hell, I'll burn you a copy of either if you ask nicely) but don't have a blog.  Blogs are for instigating conversation  with people  and continuing communication  with people  or to simply  exhibit yourself  to the public at large .  So unless you got a few other people  inside  you then a blog better be for doing all of the above with other people  outside  yourself.    Now maybe I'm missing the whole point of blogging, but isn't having a secret blog like having a walkman but no headphones?  That's dumb.  I'll concede that the blog hunt is an interesting idea but not to me.

      Or rather, what I'm doing.  I am going to make a new blog.  In it, I will confess to all of the idiotic and downright rotten things I think and do.  The catch is, I'm not going to tell any of you where it is.  If you find it, I will fully cop to it and possibly bribe you not to tell anyone else.  Granted this is a bad idea but it's late and I'm tired, and maybe a bit messed up with a cold, and there's nobody around to stop me.
