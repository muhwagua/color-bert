      J. has gone. The cancer finally beat his indomitable spirit. He lives on.

      Saw a local take on a French kiddie talent show. What was disturbing was that after each kid sang, the other kids rated him or her. (Fortunately, they were generous and granted mostly nines and tens.) Although I believe kids should be taught critical thinking, this kind of mindless judging (the kids clearly don't know what they're looking for, they're three or four years old) seems to instill a numbers mentality that will prepare them all too well for a world of opinion polls, flash surveys and, yes, body measurements and caloric reduction regimens.  Odder still, I went to the gym afterwards and saw the closed-captioned version of the "WB Superstar Search". Here was a well-endowed 18-year-old female writhing to Like A Virgin and I cringed while I pressed. Two of the judges were suitably impressed; the third said she had large breasts (upon which she beamed "They're real!") and didn't really notice her singing voice. She made the cut to the next round. I moved on to ab crunches.

      Made a much-needed $100 this morning. Was mighty glad I did. Thirty minutes later, got a $42 parking ticket. Ran out of the house to try to somehow forestall the inevitable handing down of the brutal fine, but alas it was too late. I opened my front door, and there on my front step were a young man and woman who had just finished shooting up. Their syringe was on the step. They were startled and started apologizing. I said "I don't care, get out of my way, my car is in danger". They might have been bad tripping after that.  J. looked very ill tonight. His cancer will take him in a few weeks, if that long. The sheer sadness of it all.  Speaking of sheer... How about that picture of John Kerry's daughter in that diaphanous black get-up at Cannes? He's running for leader of the free world, and of course a woman in his life has to show up somewhere and make a scene with her tits. Endless cycle.

      I wish people wouldn't waste my time so much. It's one of a handful of resources I have. It belongs to me.  Rumsfeld in Iraq. I guess he's in full control of the situation  now . He should have gotten away from his desk job a long time ago. Someone please get him in the line of fire. Bush should go to Iraq again, and not for a glorified photo op.

      Went to the garage to have my tires changed, and walked out without a car. Seems the rack and pinion got detached from the firewall at some point, and was now only bolted at one end. A dangerous situation. Who knows how long I might have been driving with that, and what would have happened had I had four-season tires.  My cactus spontaneously combusted a few days ago. The roots just caught fire, and then the pot tipped over onto the floor and some embers burned the wood floor. Who knows what would have happened had I not been there to put it out.  The guitarist from Guns & Roses has formed another band called... Velvet Revolver. Is this a bad joke? Revolver sounds like a Beatles tribute band. Velvet is taken from the Underground. Iron Butterfly and Led Zeppelin did it first. Really, why not call it Soft Hammer or Fluffy Armoured Truck? Silly, silly.

      Mr. Berg decapitated in Bagdad. Senseless. No one ever thinks he will die in such a manner. I don't necessarily dread my death, I just want it to be satisfying.  Walked down "Main Street" today. Because it was a warm, sunny day, the sidewalks were teeming with people. Good for overhearing conversations. Today, they were dull. I've realized that money really does mold one's worldview and mindset. Here's an amputee looking in a Butt Out ashtray for any worthwhile cigarettes. He needs some clothes and a shower. His discourse to passers-by is predictably hostile. Walking by him, Sue and Sam, decked out in all kinds of corporate logos, talking trivial nonsense about some product. Both the have-not and the haves are dull, I find on this dull day.  Bush looks more and more like the loser in November. He's had it coming for a while now. Meanwhile, Fantasia will win American Idol. How's Bill Rancic doing?

      Packed house tonight for Fahrenheit 9/11. Crowd applause at the end of the screening. It seems 9 out of 10 American critics have given it good reviews overall, although many are calling it flawed. Apparently, a good number of Republicans like it and it's been a sell-out in some army towns.   I was disappointed. I've seen Bowling and I know Moore's style, but still, I was looking for a more rigorous analysis of events. The first few minutes were quite interesting: the 2000 election, the vote count, and so on. Moore dredges up what may only be circumstantial evidence, without really conclusively winning his case. More time could have been devoted to that. As for everything surrounding 9/11, more time should have been devoted to prisoners' rights in Guantanamo (not even mentioned) and the whole presentation of the WMD argument leading to the attack, and the consequent back-pedaling. The media bias during the Iraq invasion was interesting to see today, but again, it was only touched upon. Really, quite incomplete, and as usual, he goes for the easy laughs. Sure, Dubya is inarticulate... it's been well-documented. But if you want to call him an airhead, tell me about it as regards his policies. The man can play golf all he wants, as far as I'm concerned. Tell us about the man's environmental policies, Michael, his stance against stem cell research, his offer to amend the Constitution to "protect" hetero marriage, his failure to stimulate the economy, the incredible deficit he's plunged the U.S. into, the way he's stoked anti-American sentiment worldwide, and so on. One priceless gem: Britney Spears pledging unconditional support to her President. It now plays like the mirror opposite of the Dixie Chicks scandal shortly before the invasion. Behind every airhead is another airhead, eh?   For a good, dissenting review of the film, one can refer to Slate, June 21 edition,and an article titled "Unfairenheit 9/11: The Lies of Michael Moore", by Christopher Hitchens.

      Had a wake for J. this week-end. Really, it's the way to go. Everyone had fun, and it was touching as well. It's all over now. I'm still finding it all hard to believe.

      Ray Charles dead at 73. Fifty years hence, people may read "Justin Timberlake dead at 73". And it will resonate as deeply for that generation. This is not necessarily meant as a slight. Justin is talented and will surprise us in the years to come, I've no doubt of that.  I think the next pope should be chosen in an unscripted drama television series. Working title: Cardinal Rules. They start out with 16 (or is it 12?) cardinals - pope wannabe's - sequestered in the Vatican, and whittle it down to two for a live finale, where John Paul's successor is chosen. The cut-away sequences where each cardinal divulges his inner thoughts to the camera could be filmed inside a confessional. The Pope himself can eliminate the cardinals each week. One of the many tasks used to test the cardinals' worthiness could be "understanding what John Paul is saying"; another could be "humoring John Paul". Also, numerous extras try to tempt the cardinals or get them to lose their cool. Pop quizzes on arcane prayers and theological fine points can round out the gauntlet these popes-in-waiting must run.

      I recently came across a book that unexpectedly has affected me in a profound way. It's by Stephen Covey, the gent who authored "The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People". I'm usually a bit skeptical of books that purport to turn you into a more efficient bot, but this latest book of his ("First Things First") answered questions I'd been asking myself a lot lately. How come I never reach my goals? Why am I drained? Why do I feel like I work and work and have little to show for it? Mr. Covey and his coven of time technicians have put their finger on it. They explain it by means of what is essentially a mnemonic device. It's a two-dimensional graphic with two axes perpendicular to one another, one axis representing the urgency of an action, the other representing its degree of importance. In so intersecting, four quadrants are created. Each quadrant corresponds to actions of differing quality: (I) urgent and important tasks, (II) non-urgent and important tasks, (III) urgent and non-important tasks, and (IV) non-urgent and non-important tasks (such as excessive TV viewing, obsessive pastimes, etc.). One's goals are achieved with Quadrant I and II activity. The trick is that many people get fooled into thinking that urgent tasks are ipso facto important tasks. In other words, they spend too much time in Quadrant III (and maybe Quadrant IV)when they should spend more time in Quadrant II. Simple, even obvious, but the mnemonic makes it powerfully effective. I now assess my actions as belonging to a particular quadrant, and it helps me weed out the time wasters.

      I've always thought that rap music will be the soundtrack to Armageddon. Especially this latter-day rap, with its pastiche of clichés, vacuity and depressing musical arrangements and lyrical themes. Call it pap.  What is it with young men walking around in baggy pants grabbing their crotches every two minutes even as they speak to you, even in mixed company? Back in the 70s, that may have been an audacious gesture. After Michael Jackson had appropriated it for a few years, it was already becoming well-worn. Of course, by the time Madonna ate that trend, you know it was old hat. Old crotch, if you prefer. There is a homoerotic component to all of this, to be sure. But I don't think even a handsome man doing that would be all that appealing after the nth time. When teens do it, especially white, middle-class, got-my-Mercedes-logo-necklace teens, it's particularly revolting.  Why are (black) rap artists not preoccupied by the environment as much as (white) pop artists like, say, Sting or Springsteen? I mean, P. Diddy is no longer struggling to get out of the projects. With so many homeboys stepping up to the mic, why aren't there more of them voicing intelligent political agenda? (Other than, say, kill the cops or some such thing.)  Finally, why are rap videos so bloody dull? I mean, all the bling-bling and brown sugar in the world can't change the fact that you're looking at some overweight, plain, late-twentysomething, dressing-under-his-age SOB that can't sing and who's got not much to say. And this is a goddam INDUSTRY. 0.5% of the GNP. Talk for talk's sake.

      The Bush Administration, spearheaded by Tom "The Fear Factor" Ridge, is considering measures for postponing the presidential election in case of terrorist attacks on the eve or on the day of the election. Bush's only chance of winning a second mandate may in fact be through a series of never-ending postponements. Call it "Justice Delayed".  Doesn't anyone on his team acknowledge that if young people abstain from sex until they get married, this lack of experience may result in their being poor lays? That even if young people marry at, say, age 25, their learning curve is such that their mental acuity is actually already starting a slow decline. In other words, as in all things, we learn most effortlessly in our formative years, our teens. Another thing: pre-marital abstinence will lead young people to recklessly dive into marriage just to get laid. Add to all that sudden State-sanctified sex a flurry of unplanned pregnancies, and you quickly realize that what should be postponed even more than sex is the marriage act.  For another good rebuttal of some of Michael Moore's more tenuous points raised in Fahrenheit 9/11, check out Newsweek's June 30 Terror Watch column, online at msnbc News.  Crest has come out with a mystifying new product, apparently aimed at youth: disposable finger-brushes. Just tear open the packet, slip this thing onto your index finger, brush your teeth with it, and discard it (but be kind to the environment). The TV campaign is actually fascinatingly watchable and well-executed. From a logical and product cycle standpoint, such a product even makes sense. "Why didn't I think of that?" is an appropriate commercial reaction. But from a sociological point of view, what have we come to? When will we have disposable anal thermometers that we slip onto our middle finger, insert, read and throw away?

      I always was fascinated, as a youngster, by the marketing of perfume: the image, the bottle and, above all, the name. Who came up with these silly and often pretentious names, I thought. Ethere, Jaipur, Lutece, Organza, and so on. I thought it would be a fun job to be the one who sat around coming up with all these monickers. They were stupid names, but there seemed to be some creativity involved there. Even something like Poison or White Diamonds has an aura to it.  Well, the great dumbing-down of America continues and, sadly, it's hit the perfume business. I saw an in-store promotion for Estée Lauder's new scent, Provocative Woman. It doesn't get less esoteric than that, does it? The poster features a woman pulling up her long skirt to just below her knees, frolicking in an urban street filled with water. This is not a low-end product either, but definitely mid-range. There's so much product out there, a consumer doesn't have time to figure out the perfume's market niche, its spell if you will, let alone actually smell the fragrance. Just tell me the personal image category that the perfume and its bottle fall into, in 10 seconds or less, and I'll decide if I want it or if I keep looking.   Some other perfumes to watch out for in the coming months: Raunchy Redneck, Bi Guy, Horny Housewife, Virginal Tease. Somehow, a perfume named Boy Toy would now make sense. Quick, get me Madonna's team.   At least we've still got those wonderfully silly names for paint samples, right?
