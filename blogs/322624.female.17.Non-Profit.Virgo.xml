I wanna know...........Cuz when you put peanuts in a baggie and crunch them up, then eat them, it's ALMOST the same thing................. I wonder...................

      My parents left me alone for 2 hours and insanity took over. First I washed my hair...with Herbal Essense. I started yelling "Where are my Elf guys?! Come to me pretty guys! Come and wash my hair!" ...no one came... \/ \/ Then I went outside and was walking on top the snow. I was like "O! Look at me! I'm an elf! Walking on the snow! I'm a beast! ...geez I sound like Destinie. Okay, going back to being kim!" Then I fell into a hole and snow went up my pant legs >

      gah, sorry guys I got backed up >  Dest's dream: Well at least I'm noticed missing. you see me and Bakura were uh.."cleaning" the supply closet for Mrs. Swann...yeah *cough* -^ ^-  Yami: Yami or Yugioh is a thousand years old pharoh from Eygpt. Back then, they used magic to have battles with monsters as fun. the loser lost his life (thats always fun). but then the monsters started to get out of hand because of a magical demention called the shadow relem. here, the monsters actually came to life. to seal way the shadow relem, yugioh trapped himself and others into 7 "melenium objects". Now, several people have possion of these objects. when yugi needs help with the duel monster cards, yugioh takes control of his body.He's called yami because its the jap. name for dark. Yami also calls yugi hikari (light) or aibou (companion). so basically, Yami isa spirit thats takes control of Yugi in times of danger.  Janine: Hun, you are in the reality bound comic but you are not part of the crew. The Group is the basic cast and crew. Answer this: Do you sit at the third table in the CCSA caf. at lunch time, at 11:10 everyday? No? Then you arn't in the crew.  Piccy of Janine: Very nicly drawn Dest! You keep getting better at drawing anime us :) wee.just in case anyone is wondering where i am, i had a doc. appointment. he still isn't too sure about me going to school >

      O_O;;; Okay, Yugioh is a schizo so when his little magical thing errupts, this big tall guy with the same hairdo appears and his name is "Yami" or something like that. His voice gets deeper too, it's weird. Omg, I was playing the Two Towers video game and the actors do the character's voices. (he he he) Oh yeah, and Janine is always like, "where's me? I wanna be in the RBcrew picture" and I'm like, "You're not in the crew. The crew is the group" and she doesn't get it!! GRRRR! What is her problem! Someone explain it to her! I will draw her tribute and post it here but she needs to realize she is not in the GROUP!!  Hey David, did you finish the quiz yet? :)

      I am so bored. I want school. >D I had this weird dream...   So I was walking down a dark alleyway at about four in the morning. I was walking along side of Joey and Yugi was to his right. I was dressed in a robe, laced with gold with a bunch of gold chains and cloth underneath. Joey, was clad all in black with the same. Yugi, was well, Yami. Three people blocked our way up ahead and I couldn't make them out until the moon shined down on them and I noticed it was Yami Bakura, Marik, and some guy in a turban. Marik, who looked very mad, said something that I could not understand and a big moster appeared. It was Obelisk the Tormentor or something like that. Yugi's pyramid began to glow and the monster was all sucked up. Then, Marik, Looking even more pissed off, sent out a big, golden gryphon thing. I wipped out some Jackie Chan, Tossing aside the robe and sid some flips and stuff. Then I swung this big, gold staff that I had and the gryphon got sucked up. I smiled. Then Marik was really really really mad and he sent out an invisible moster that began to chase me. I was scared. I ran to a corner then Joey kicked a paint can full of blue paint. I then saw the feet that looked like elephant feet and then I swung my staff and electricity ran out. Then, a big bolt of lightning shot down from the sky and killed the monster. I looked around the corner and the police were coming! So I ran and was like, "The police! The police!" The two other people ran away but Bakura was like, "Quick! Follow me!" So we climbed up on a roof and flattened ourselves out and laid there. Then one of the officer's looked up and was like, "I see you, come down" (Meanwhile, two kids were running around screaming, 'Yo Trabajo! I'll get you!') "We're not the bad guys." I told him. "I know." We all began to walk away when Bakura was like, "Come here, look" And pointed to our staffs. (Joey's red, Mine gold; we had left them up there) And he said, "I could take them if you'd like." I gave him a sideways glance and uttered, "Noooo." We worked our way to school. When I finally got to school, the teachers were lined up at the doors talking about the "electric storm" so I stopped by my spanish teacher and asked her about if she saw the electric storm. She said, "No, I was taking care of my ferret." So Joey decided to run off (meanwhile, I'm still holding his staff in a plastic shoprite bag.) I went to look for him, when someone told me we had a half day. I seriously needed to look now, so I went into the cafeteria and called for him, he didn't come. Sighing, I walked away to board the bus. The bus was driving away when I ran and jumped into the bus (still holding the staffs) and I began to fall asleep because I was tired. I had spanish homework in my lap and the kid was like, "Hey! Don't stare, look, you're doing your spanish work wrong! That is nosotronamos!" I glared and thought, no way that is nosotrosamos! Outside, someone was flagging me down going, "I FOUND JOEY!" I jumped out of the bus and ran into the school where I saw David and Assia. "Hey!" David cried. "Have you seen Joey?" I asked them. "No." They said. "How about kim?" "No." They said. Sighing, I noticed that the bus was leaving. I asked TK if I could use his cellphone so he handed me a yellow remote. "You have to press this, this, this this this and this, to get it to go. Then you press the number and then press this, this this and this!" I put in the number but it was wrong. I tried to press the buttons in sequence to get it to work, but I did it wrong. Then I remembered that Joey and I were going to WALK home so I didn't need to worry. (Though my school is 40 mins away from my house) Then, while I was walking down the hallway, I saw Yami Yugi. "Have you seen Joey?" I asked. "I looked in the cafeteria, he wasn't there." Yugi said he didn't and I was sad and then...   I woke up. >.

      O_O; Thanks. Did you guys notice I'm adding the gallery here? Blahh!  Kim, I redid your picture (by the way, I loved it, it was so cute) I colored and I couldn't fit everyone on there, I draw too big. GNOMIE'S A PIMPIN' CAT!! Woo! The first thing janine said to me was, "Where's me?!?!" I had to explain she's not in the "group". *sigh* 'tis what you get once you add a minor character, don't you agree??  I can't think of any random quotes... ah! Wahh! Now, I am off to work on the website. Mangos... and cheese! (omg- wait! Kim, I am doing the "Origin of T-K-OH, with squirrels!" I need a better script idea...) Here's my quote then...  Tk: Once I finish the puzzle, You will all obey my fists of Iron... and cheese!!!  Tk: (again- firedrill day) Leggo my fuego!

And Pippin dies! j/k He almost does. Everyone thought he was but he didn't. SO everyone lived happily ever after. >

       The Vocal Thing: You know how Mrs. Eldreth gave us points on the board for singing loud and stuff or were you not there those two days?  Yugi: yeah, me and Dest went on a rampage, but you have to admit the psychopaths are really cute ^ ^  Quiz: I was bored and taking random tests and I took the RB test again, and I was David...  Rave: Raves are Nice... ~ ^  Thursday Lunch: We were all really bored and were pretending to be the power rangers. Then Mouse complained that she's always a cat thing in stuff and was going to make a Mouse Zoid. So there's your explaination. Guess What?! I forgot to enter this today, it's my Dad's B-Day so bow down to him...at least say happy birthday ^ ^ HAPPY BIRTHDAY DAD!

MWA HA HA HA HA HA!!! "you have a lava lamp, i have a bucket." "most people would be happy meeting themselves once, i get to meet myself twice!" "Welcome to the TK army, and remember, it's not the size of your heart, it's the size of my paycheck. NOW GIVE ME A DOLLAR!" hehehe, you'll have to ask kim for explanation...

               Ok, this blog, well, I won't go in detail. Is starting to annoy me, well, theres a few things any way. So, after reading everything in the past few days I guess, I'm like ok..... I'm not takeing that stupid Yugi test, Yugi is highly starting to annoy me. I mean its reach its level of "I don't give a shit" I don't want to hear it...... but the yugi stuff isn't what annoys me, alought it did peve me a lil on the page to scroll down and see 5 huge pics. I dunno. Any way. I like your song kim yay fer you.  yeah des. we had a theme song apointed by you but, does that song really fit, I dunno I remember thinking it didn't..... So yay, for all the quizs, bah to Des, Wha? to Kim cuz I still dunn understand the vocal thing, or the edit thing, pha to the Yugi shit TAKEING OVE MY SCREEN, Like the FACE TAKEING OVER AMERICA!    Oh an      The quiz lies....  and I think its all from perspetive but I think gnome should at least be in it...... She deserves as much as Assia.....

      I ment on Blogger.... any way...  This is a very very very Funny story about me and Tais adventure to get money from Gnome so she can get to the prom. First the back story. We set it up last night, that after school I would drive up to the UofD to get the money, we planned on being there around 4.... that didn turn out so well. I wanted Tai to be with me... In case soemthing went wrong.... and Boi, Heh Heh, Did they!  Now I don't Feel like telling this story again as I am tired of wrong, So I'll post me and Gnoems IM's from when I told her....Feel free to correct spelling, and shit.   So I Called this a Reality Bound Ep. Called "Gnome Money Pick Up"     QuyteDragonSlaya:  me and Tai went down there..... we got there real late though, around 10     QuyteDragonSlaya:  then I forgot the directions cuz I was rushed to leave     RavNic1:  down where, down newark?   QuyteDragonSlaya:  and... we went to the trabant center... and looked around there.. and we were really stressed and pressed for time and all this shit was goin in my head   RavNic1:  awww     QuyteDragonSlaya:  Well,  I forgot the turn left at trabant, and turned right     RavNic1:  you were supposed to turn right     QuyteDragonSlaya:  cuz I had to have the car back at 5, and kinda kinnaped Tai who had to be home at 5:30... and it was like omg     RavNic1:  there was a parking lot on your right as you took the turn     QuyteDragonSlaya:  yeah, I found that out when I got home, read the directs. and was like... SHIT     RavNic1:  awww     RavNic1:  it's ok, we will figure this out   QuyteDragonSlaya:  yeah, but hmmm we'll come up with something.... first a story    QuyteDragonSlaya:  haha cuz when we were up there, we did some funny ass shit to find you     QuyteDragonSlaya:  we broke, sooooo many laws on campus hahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  Omg... haha     RavNic1:  ok, do tell   QuyteDragonSlaya:  Tai was supoused to be lookin to the right, she said nothin was there,      QuyteDragonSlaya:  Well, ok first i was all speedin to get up there bein as we were all late and didn have time, and like we got every red light on kirkwood I swear, and I was passin people like nuts, agressive driveing.... which we found I am really good at, I was actually driveing better today when I didn have Chris by me bitching that I am about to do something wrong, when not worrying about it, we were fine me And Tai  QuyteDragonSlaya:  any way     RavNic1:  yayness!!! anyway     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so we go up main Street.... I couldn't remember weather u said the first traffic light turn, or the last one... All I guess I really remembered was the trabant center     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so I looked for it     RavNic1:  okies   QuyteDragonSlaya:  so down main street I keep switchin lanes not sure which one to be in and passin people, goin through yellow lights lol, not bothing to stop for pedestrians like is hould     QuyteDragonSlaya:  should*     QuyteDragonSlaya:  I*     QuyteDragonSlaya:  lol     RavNic1:  good boy, don't stop for those umb college kids     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and then we trun down trabant, i told tai to keep a loom out for you.... Then i told her to keep a look out for parking.     QuyteDragonSlaya:  So we can't fidn parking, we are stressed for time so I didn feel like aprkin somewhere and walkin back... we keep passin student parking, and finally I'm like hmm.... lets just try something.. So we turn in to one about 4 blocks down and on the left     QuyteDragonSlaya:  first we went up to those lil things where u need to slide a card and it lets you pass in to the parking....     QuyteDragonSlaya:  well, we though jus by chance it maybe jus you could pay for a thing, no... so we backed out.... and were about to go back on the street when we notice     QuyteDragonSlaya:  that lil parking loops around, and comes out to our right, with no gaurder things blockin it, and jus "wrong way, and one way street" signs on it...and there was parkin at teh end of it...     RavNic1:  oh no you didn't   QuyteDragonSlaya:  So  turn to Tai and I'm like "wana be daring"  "Sure"  "hang on"  and speed down the one way parking thing hahahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  in the wrong direction hahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and people all out and watchin us, givin us looks hahaha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and we park, and on the slant you are not supoused to be able to park, amazeingly, i did it perfectly     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so we jump out, and are tryin to act all casual.... haha     QuyteDragonSlaya:  and of course we relize, that to park there... you need a lil pass in your window as well... which we did not.... So i am like... Ok lets make this fast befor anyone has time to get a cop or soemthiin out here....     QuyteDragonSlaya:  So we like speed walked up to trabant, and jay walked a lot to get there, not careing if we pissed people off     RavNic1:  good boy   QuyteDragonSlaya:  sorry, sis was talkin to me     QuyteDragonSlaya:  so we walk around in trabant, our front of trabant, prolly acorss the street from where u are....

      Well, I was thinking Wednesday night when My mom drops Daniel off at Karate we could all meet at Regal at 5:00 and see a movie of some sort. ^.^ And you all missed it!! My mother invited Connor to the park with us. He rode his bike over and we played frisbee and stuff. Janine went crazy she wanted to meet him so bad. (Yahuk Yahuk ^_^***) Janine wants me to tell you all about Daniel and how he spit all over himself. Blah!!   Caption Contest  (Why didn't I win the last time?? Anyway, here it is:) So... I asked for some pants and all I got was this lowsy telephone... Next time I'll use Singular Wireless!

      *wishes she'd stop being sick* :p If anyone wants to blame someone for me not being there today, blame TK. I had this dream last night...well actually i had two but anyway, the first one, I thought it was today, and we were going through the normal school day, i was late so i didn't get to see TK and his scythe it'll 4th period. at lunch, we all went up to my locker, per normal except TK was really going at it with his cloak and scythe. And then he opened his locker grabbed pete, who was for some reason in there and why did i make him sound like a person?. and stabbed him with the scythe. Friut guts went everywhere and it smelled horrible! I mean, it was so nasty! Dest, Assia and I ran to the bathroom next to the dance room and D and Tai ran the other way. I woke up in my bathroom throwing up. *shivers* it was sooooo nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (pete i mean but that was too)  Ugh! the second dream i had when i got back to sleep about 7 o'clock. For some reason, we (my family) took a train to a mall where there were all these fansy resuranunts. We going to have dinner with my aunt and grandparents there. We met David and TK in front of the resuraunt, they were just there chillin' . But the i remebered i didn't have time to change from my p.j.s (i'm standing there in a mall in my pjs!)  so my dad and i went into stores trying to find a fansy outfit for me. We went into this one store and he picked up these cool sparkley pair of pants and then he said they would fit cause I was fat. HE CALLED ME FAT! and then I woke up. > *Sounds like Cho making fun of her mother* Moral of story...don't drink a bottle of v. coke when yo feel sick at 1 am in the morning then go to bed. Also, if your friend tells you they love you...DON'T PUNCH! say...thank you.

      ATTENTION DUELISTS! no i'm not going to say the quote, i just needed some sort of heading. anyway, as some of you know i went to my sister's play at her school a while ago and there are some weird things that you must know! first off, THEIR SODA MACHINES ARE OFF EVEN AFTER SCHOOL HOURS! that was some good cherry coke.. i did have to bribe hitty-smacky with a soda so she'd stop dancing and stripping on the table in front of the rest off the cast after the play. but her soda got stuck so it al worked out, HA! and yet another reason why our school is better than thiers, they don't have an autoturrium, they just set up chairs in the cafeterria. AND THEIR CAFETERRIA IS SMALLER THAN THE SENIOR LUNCH ROOM! yeah... so anyway, their smoke machine set off the fire alarm, every night so far, lol, and my sister has a reputation as a whore at her school (we won't discuss that) so thats it. oh yeah, she did try to convince me that this guy she knew is another stalker to add to my list (if you don't know the story about the first, welll... ask someone else, i am done tellin it) wjere was i, oh yes, just because he was askin my sister if i was gonna be there for the show that night than hangin around me till i left does not mean he's my stalker! don't they have to be hiding in the bushes with a camera or somethin? anyway, my sugar high is wearing off so i'm gonna go! see you all on monday, with my sythe MWA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!  ps okay, i have to say it: attention duelists, i'm not wearing any pants! and dest, have you ever been to the dentist? hehehe, i'm gonna have to put up with mr thirsty a lot on monday now, but it was worth it

      Kim, you have done something horrible to me. I am having dreams with EWAN MCGREGOR!!!!!! AGGAGAGAGAGAAAAAA!!  Anyway, so I was riding on a bus with you and him sittin' there dressed up like Obi Wan. And I'm like, "gee, mister, you look familiar. What's your name?" And he's like, "Ewan Mcgregor." And I was like, "Wow. You're famous!" So then we get off the bus and he's running around training jedi and kim's having mucho fun at this point and I'm so bored. Then one of the jedi throw on a magic necklace that allows them to do like harry potter crap and I'm like... what happened to the force? "that's outdated" anyway... it was weird.  I'm advanced! go to: oekaki.n3.net and go to the advanced board! I have a pic of link up there!! :)

YOU RUINED THE DREAMMMMMMM!   Oh, by the way... I went to ringbearer.org the other day and they had lotr answering machine messages and I was like, "FUNNY! Weee!" So I wrote my own:   Legolas: Sorry I'm not availible right now. Please leave a message and I'll get back to you after I lather, rinse, and repeat... wait- I missed a spot--------  Aragorn: This is Aragorn, son of Arathorn. I'm not here at the moment for I am busy saving some poor pathetic race from destruction, being smelly and manly, or hanging with one of my many girlfriends. *slap* ow! *beeeeeeeep*  Arwen: Hello, this is Arwen, daughter of Peter Jennings... I mean Elrond. If You wish to talk to me, leave a message after the beep. But- If it's Aragorn, don't bother. I'm not talking to you.  Tom Bombadill: This is Tom! Are your ponies smarter than you? Are you lost in the Barrow Downs? Are you looking for a good time? Then stop on by, me and Goldberry have Karaoke every thurday and tuesday oh! But if this is Peter Jackson, I keep a machetti in my closet so don't even think of coming by!! You and your tom-less *beeeeping* script!

      Well, I guess to tell everyone at once, so I dunn have to say it a million times. I will inform you guys that me and Chris Broke up last night after the ball game. It was just kinda time, I wasn't really ready, but we knew it was comein.  Besides the sex was really bad, so i don't care haha J/K.                 Nah, I'm sad and all, but w've agreed to be friends and stil go to newyork, and to See Cho together. After that, who knows what will happen. Some how though, this things makes no sense to me, any way. Any how, as I know some nosey people like to read break up convers from the intertent, and since we are a tv show, and a comic you can get a copy of the script from last night, by e-mailing me. ....I think my e-mails on this site some where........    Any way, here is to being back in the hunt for a new man ::Cheers to eveyone..... drinks down fast and gets really drunk::

      I came up with the following drabble after D, TK, and I snuck in to see the beginning of X2. Then I read the MAD version. hehehe :p   David: I'm Jean Grey, and even though I don't have a cool super hero name, I have mind powers that let me make any cute guy I want to strip. *points to random hot guy* *guy's pants fall down*  David: ...close enough.  ~~  Kim: I'm Storm. Along with my wickedly white hair, I have the power over the weather and can make hurricanes with the blink of an eye! *lifts up arms like Storm usually does* *it drizzles*  Kim: *blink* ...any minute now....yeah...  >  >  ~~  Destinie: Yo! I'm Nightcrawler with a brooklyn accent! Not only am I blue but i can transport instantly to anywhere I want! *transports*  *poofs on Miami beach* uhh... *transports*  *poofs in the middle of a penguin herd* umm... *transports*  *poofs in the middle of a field* Okay, I'm lost.  ~~  TK: I am Magnito! The villian of this movie! But from now on, you will all call me Gumsualo! And with my power over gum, I shall rule the world! Muhahahaha!  *camera pans out to show him in a cage*  TK: ...as soon as I get out of this hamster cage...  ~~  RB-Men (And women!) 2!  Dest: There was a first?  Kim: Look! Its raining harder!  TK: Obey me!  David: Strip damn you, Strip!  *TK's clothes strip off except for his boxers*  Kim and Dest: EEEE!!! *run off screen*  David: Oops...  TK: _O O_ A little help?  ~~~End~~~    hehehe, in the movie, Jean's powers go hay-wire so hence why D stripped TK and since I only saw up to that part, D your powersare going to be messed up until I see the rest.

      Sorry I couldn't make it, guys. ;__; I was bored all Saturday and Connor came over. Wee! We were bored! (Heather scared him. It was pretty funny.) Is Kingdom Hearts made by Squaresoft?

      *yawn* I'm so tired... - - Anyway, this came to me after reading the story of Newark and at 12:00 at night. >   Author: Snarky (Kim)  Rating: G (A few curses)  Disclaimer: This is the only story I have ever written that I can say IT'S ALL MINE! Please don't steal! ^ ^   Summery: The Title says it all. Now, the show...err Story!    Reality Bound Productions Presents...    Looking For A Gnome!    On the streets of Newark, the unsupecting shoppers, students, wanderers, and couple are forced out of their Sunday stuour by a life size Gnome running across the street.   A few minutes later, a couple is confronted by...a midgit?   Tai: Hi! Sorry to bother you but have either of you seen a Gnome? *holds up a shirt* She needs this.   A few minutes later, a block away a girl and a guy appear with guns. They look around the street before looking in trash cans and under rocks.   Behind them a cloaked figure carries a sign reading 'Gnome Hunting Season'. Seeing the people's eyes on him and the sign, the cloaked figure takes out a scythe out of his cloak and turns the sign around. It now reads 'I am Death.' Turning the sign around to Gnome Season again, he continues to follow the two.   Just then a Gnome runs across the street just behind the trio.   On another part of Main Street, the midgit how has a friend. The two girls walk down the street calling for...a gnome?   Tai: Gnome! Come Out!   Dest: Here Gnome! Heel Girl!   The others around them don't know how to react.   Meanwhile, down the street a bit, the girl and guy are currently against a police car while two police officers pat the teenagers down.   Kim: They're fake! We swear! It's all a fun comic...thingy!   David: yeah! ...uh...the guns were supposed to be fake?   Kim: ...yeah...   The two look at each other but for Kim starts slaming her head against the car roof and David looking at the sky whistling.   Elsewhere, The Life size Gnome is being chased by the cloaked figure, aka Death. They duck into an alley way and a bttle or struggle can be heard. The cloaked figure comes out of the alley with something in his hand. As he speeds off to find the others he doesn't see the life size Gnome peeking out from the alley.   Somewhere...Out there...okay back to Newark.   The gang has gotten back together when TK crosses the street.   TK: I found her! I found the Gnome!   He holds up the object, which turns out to be a garden gnome.   Kim: Thats a garden gnome.   David: We're looking for a pimp life size one.   TK: oops.   Tai: Nuts! (Kim: Cheese!) She's gotten away again!   Dest: What do we do now?   David: We have to find that Gnome! It's our duties as Cabbies and original Reality Bound members! We have to find her and we will! With Satan,a nd God laughing their asses off at us, by god, we will find her!   Everyone: *blink* *blink*   TK: Or we could get Ice Cream.   David: that too. To the Ice Cream Shop!   They cross the street and enter the parlor only to stop just inside the door way gasping.  Tai: It's the Gnome!    T o  B e  C ontinued!   David: And She has Ice Cream! How come she gets Ice Cream?!   Kim: Shut up! The Story's over! Go to fade out!   *~Fades To Black~*   TK: *with a flashlight* look look! Shadow puppets!   *@*% BANG !*#@*   *the light goes out*

      LOL D, in the book Hedwig (Harry Owl) was attacked. I know who attacked her! Run D! Run! Anyway, I thought I'd share this with everyone since D's in such a good mood over HP. In the Book, Ron (Uglyest of the ugly children) and Hermione (robyn played her in our comic) have this conversation and I could swear it was D and Robyn.  "Ron! We're supposed to show the first years where to go!" "Oh yeah," Said Ron, who had obviously forgotten. "Hey--hey you lot! Midgets!" "Ron!"  -^ ^- Doesn't that sound like them? Finished the book in a recorded time of 6 hours 23 minutes and 45 seconds. BOO YA! ... *realizing she has to wait another 3 years for the next book* ... D@MN F*CKIN& $HIT! F*CKIN& @$$ ^#*!^ %$!#! *%^#!!!!!!!!!!!!!  *Goes back to slash fanfiction muttering about authors who update sooner then Zogby getting thin on Jenny Criag*

      A suspicion about what??? Tell Tell! BTW, Thought i'd share this with everyone. I had me laughing so hard i was tearing up.  By Hogwarts Dropout (aka a fanfiction author)  Well ladies and gentleman, I've donned the drag, consulted my horoscope, and sat down to predict the happenings in book 5 (order of Pheniox). Let me say now that I'm a serious diviner, and that this information is 100% accurate. And in case it's not, my name's not Hogwarts Dropout and if you're an angry mob of bloodthirsty fans, I ran the other way.  So smack your five bucks on the table, give me a minuet to shuffle the cards, and without further ado .  In chapter one, Harry's going to have to do some work. It will mostly likely be hot outside. I'm fairly confident that at some point in chapter one, Rowling will comment on the heat. Not Harry in heat - Harry in THE heat. That's a common mistake that inexperienced fortunetellers make. Particle words can really screw you over sometimes.  In chapter two, the fates are telling me Harry will wear some article of clothing. It could be a glittery thong, or it could be a smelly sock. The ball's a bit foggy on that. Oh yeah - Voldemort will take over the world and Dumbledore will have a bag of popcorn. She won't talk about the popcorn, but he's going to be eating it. You can put money on that one.  In chapter nine, Harry will discover the Order of the Pheonix. It is not an award, nor is it a super secret organization that inducts teenagers into their ranks because that's SO realistic and that's what ALL super secret agencies against the dark do. No, it is just Dumbledore's unique filing system. You heard me. It's how Dumbledore keeps things in ORDER. He leaves all his important papers out and the ones that his PHEONIX shits on are the ones he throws away. Mystery solved.  In chapter four, Harry will comment on one of his teachers. There will be a new teacher, but no one cares about her or the millions of fanfics that will be written in which she transforms into a Mary Sue and has randy sex with Snape. We're only interested in the new Hogwarts janitor. His name is Bob, and he's eventually going to leave because of alleged claims of sexual assault. Bob, if I've told you once, I've told you a million times. Flitwick is gonna grope ya, and you have to be prepared for that.  In chapter negative two, Harry will suffer through the death of one of his dear friends. Is it Ron? No. Hermione? No. Well then who is it? Give the spirits a second - they say it's the battery in Harry's vibrating dildo. Holy shit, this IS scary.  In chapter twelve, the Quidditch quandary will be resolved. The new keeper is the ghost of James Potter. He's not very good, but nobody really cares because we just don't want to let Harry's parents stay dead. They must appear in every friggin book, so that soon Harry's going to get sick of his parents and they'll have a fight and he'll tell them that he wishes they were dead in a fit of hormonal teenage angst. Then he's going to realize that they really are dead and we'll have to go through the whole sob story all over again. And the new captain of the team is Terry Boot. No one can explain this, because he's neither Gryffindor, nor a quidditch player. I just call it as I see it.  In chapter thirty six, the famous narrator of the Harry Potter books, who is so great he got a grammy, will loose his voice four words before he reaches the last phrase - which is - after much debate -  "This is the end, dumbass. Close the friggin book."  In chapter fifteen, the romance issue will be addressed. Harry is going to find out that he suddenly has a raging stiffy in the presence of his owl, but bestiality is not okay and will not be addressed. Instead, he will cover his secret urges by a seemingly normal and sickeningly superficial relationship with 'I-want-to-be-popular-and-date-Harry-so-much-that-I'm- going-to-slit-my-wrists' Ginny Weasley. We'll have to put up with her bullshit for an entire thirty-eight chapters until we can get back to fanfiction and read normal, healthy slash fanfiction. I predict that it will get harder and harder for fanfiction slash writers to transform Harry's hetero urgings in the book into homo fantasies in fanfiction. God I hope they can still do it believably.  In chapter twenty-two, Harry will see a book/read one/mention one/be in one. It's one of those - take your pic.  And that concludes my prediction. I hope this clears up any confusion out there. I know a lot of people are spouting bullshit about an actual plot, but we fanfiction writers know that's just another word for 'annoying thing that gets in my way when I'm trying to write it the way it should have been done'.

      3 -4 pm honey. BTW, Dest. I was thinking about the animal pictures that we drew and instead of (random thought: I forgot about gnome! Damn!) doing out own story, I thought we could copy Fruits Basket. For those who do know what fruits Basket is, Its a new anime about a family and a girl who comes to live with them. The family has a curse on them though, if a person is hugged by the opposite sex, then they turn into an animal.  -^ ^- Isn't that great? lol. Just think, D, Tai and I are alway hugging each other so it's like every five minutes "Oh fuck!" "We forgot...again!" "Squeak!!!" LOL

      Hey all. Got back from taking my SAT w/ Bobicus. There were only 4 Cabbies there (at least from what we saw). Bobicus, Me, Nicloe (Carrow) and Ariana (The one who wore the purple tutu thingy at Prom). So yeah, It was at St. marks High School. For those who don't know, it's a privite Catholic High School. But, OMG! It made me want to go "Yay for God!" They had carpet everywhere! Of course there wasn't a clock in any of the rooms. But talk about a huge school. They even had a chapel thingy. Oo; It's behind a huge graveyard and has a huge field. Plus the student parking lot is big. It was just soooo nice! Except...they have smaller lockers then us. Which makes me start thinking, do they have as many books as us? HMMM...  Anyway, I fixed Randum's hair as D said, now...GO ADOPT A RANDUM MINI....THINGY!  urlLink  Clicky Here!

      Hey hey, with nothing to do I have typed out my spanish story. Could everyone look at the english verison and tell me what they think? REmember this is sopposed to be a kid book. But I think it's funny, expectally with the pictures I have in my mind. -^ ^- Hello. My name is Destiny. I live on a farm with my friends. Every morning we wake up to the chickens or rather Kim chasing the chickens. Today is Monday, which means it's Connor's turn to make breakfast. After we eat we go to do our daily chores. Kim, David, TK, and Connor head out to the fields. Rhandi, Robyn, and I to do clean the house and gather eggs and milk. Everyone meets back up for lunch made by Rhandi. After lunch the others head back to the fields while Rhandi takes the milk and eggs into town. It's my turn to do the laundry. Kim and the others return for dinner around 5 o'clock carrying vegtables and some fruit. Kim and I start to make dinner. At 6 o'clock, Rhandi and Robyn come back from the town with meat. Today they bring back chicken. Yesturday we had beef. Dinner is done around 7 and everyone is happy. After dinner TK and David do the dishes then we all play for an hour. Now it's time for bed! Tomorrow will be like today but everyday is different. I love living with my friends. Goodnight.  So is it bad? it is! all well. I think it's sopposed to be ^ ^;

      O also, on the site, one thing I don't like... It took me a while to figure out where to go to READ the actual comic! Lol. Its the main point of the site and yet the link to read it is jus kinda flimsily throw in there somewhere... I was like oo.... read it there..... In with the Bios.. shouldn't it have a movieng thing of it own, Or shouldn't the movieng thing go to the comic and at the comic is a link to the bios, not the other way around? I dunno, it just seems to make more sense to me. Cuz like I said (knowing I'm dumb) I couldn't find where to read the actual comic when its the main point of the site!

      I'm here I'm here... Oh and I have some reality Bound Quotes from last night!!!!  Tai: "I did not influence him, I just suggested it..."  Me and Tai: "SNACK PACK!!!"  the last one we need to explain. There was this guy in wawa (besides Anth) who was hott. Then he went in a back room. I was sad. We saw boiled eggs in a pack that said SNack Pack. I said, "Ewwww, those arn't my snack pack.... my snack pack went in to the back room. :("  and then the guy came back and I kept calling him snack pack and checking him out, all night we kept calling hot guys snack packs. I thinka  snack pack, is either a guys package, or his 6 pack, not sure what, but its something ah well. SNACK PACKS FOREVER!!!!!!!!

No one cared, or noticed as we inched our ways closer and closer to the empty seats down belowe hehehe. We could actually see their faces and sweat now, :), and the music was loud, and we had room to dance our ass's off. We made friends with security so they let us stay there. And later, We got to go on stage!!!! Cuz they were letting people from the low ground level go on stage, and our security friends hehehe, let us go down there and get on with people!!!! :) We got to see Bon Jovi real up close, and he blew Tai a kiss she flipped omg haha was great :). Then we went back to our plat form and danced all night to the music and screamed till we no longer could, my throught still hurts!!! My legs hurt when we got home, we made that place a club.

I saw Dragonheart again last night and cried again. Not because Draco died, not this time, but because David Thewlis is playing Lupin... *sniff* What a cruel cruel world we live in. Hey! The guy they chose for Peter might actually be a good fit. ^^;;;;

      Question for everyone (btw, since some people don't come to blogger I'll e-mail this to everyone). I am creating a neohome on Neopets for us. How? Well, we now have a neopets account. (reality_bound) The reason i did this is mostly for advertisment purposes. Also, if you don't have a neopets account and wish to see what its all about you can go on the groups. (reality_bound) If you people do have a neopets account and reality_bound has yet to ask you to be it's neofriend please either mail me your account's name and i'll ask or you can ask reality_bound yourself. Now, back to my original question. I am making a neohome for us all. What floor you you want your room? You have ground floor, 1st floor, and then 2nd floor. Also, if you have any preferances on who you want to be next to or you want to be on the east side or something please tell me now. Otherwise i'll get very pissy at you. ^^ Any ground floor people, I need to know now what you want your room to be made out of; cardboard, straw, twigs, bamboo, wood, chocolate, jelly, stone, brick, white chocolate, marble, silver, cloud, gold, or transparishield. I only need to know  ground floorers  room types at the moment. Everyone got that? Or are they confused? Also, Dest found place we can make our stuff online. It's better the 99dogs D, they have mugs, mouse pads, posters, and (i'm mentioning this just to make you happy.) thongs. Happy D? you can put doritos or penguiens on a thong for you ^^;;;

Also, afterwards some of us are heading to TK's house to chill. Plus I'm probably going to bring over my tape with has Teen Titans o it, 'cause I know none of you saw it ^^; It's funny! And it is so us. BTW, D and I figured out who everyone will be. Robyn is Robin (*snort* she's gonna kill me), Dest is Starfire, Assia is Raven, Gnomie is Cyborg, and Tai is Beastboy err girl errr mouse. Beastmouse. > "My double is the prime minister." "George, your exact double is the prime minister?" "Yeah, thank god he doesn't look like me." LOL! ^^ yeah yeah, none of you got that, whatever. ^^

      #1: Smurfy doesn't like "online" XD   #2: I checked out the rules for the Manga contest, Snarky. They said that any comic that makes fun of actual people/plagerizes/ takes other peoples ideas will be disqualified. This means Reality Bound. *sniff* But I am going to try!! I'm going to try with Toro Dimensional Warrior!! (And I won't make it probably, but I'll be working hard!) Keep me in... er... thoughts er prayers er whatever... >0;;

Of course da nd I don't have our glasses so we can't see it ^^; I dunno, i thought it was funny. YES! Sirius is dead! poor Harry.

      Thank you gnomie ^^ I'm still freaked out about it tho. (it's later today.   "How about we see PotC (Pirates of the Carrybean aka Orlando Bloom's movie to try and get people to see he's not just an elf) friday? okay with people?"  Friday . How about we see PotC Friday. I know you can't talk gnome, but it might be good to get you out of the house. ^^

      How about we see PotC (Pirates of the Carrybean aka Orlando Bloom's movie to try and get people to see he's not just an elf) friday? okay with people?   Ok. Gnome can answer this!! Considering that it was posted on Tuesday, and it is now Thursday, it is irrelevant if I can go or not because I cannot go back in time. Am I right?!?!  But seriously. I've been on a deathbed basically since LAST Thursday, haven't even touched the computer really. Until Wednesday. And since I'm not allowed out of the house anyway, I figured I'd answer your question later. As in right now. But you didn't know that, so I apoligize ::holding out a big bundle of flowers::  I think your other question was "will someone go to the MRI with me?" Which was Wednesday. AS previously stated, I was in my sick bed and could not get up to go w ith you. My heart did however go out to you while I read this, and I sternly told myself to write a reply. Which is right here. I hope it went well, my mommy has a big problem with MRI things too. If you really get freaked, you should get your parents to take you to the one in Philadelphia. They put on music for you, it's completely open, they let someone sit beside you........ Totally user-friendly. There's even a little fan blowing air on your face so you know you're ok.  Seriously babe, if you need anything call. I'll help as much as a chipmunk-faced Gnome can. Love ya!!!

I sense dick..::looks out window, theres a man:: hahaha, in all seriouseness.......   Omg the other day Tk and I were walking and I could not hear him talking next to me, but somehow, I heard someone say penis in a building like a mile away..... was like " My penis senses are tingleing" ......... and when we got closer, sure enough, they were talking bout penis..... Moral of story... if Tk really wanted me to listen to him, he should start his sentances with the word penis!

      Arg, I think I'm so bored that I'm talking. >  The Teen Titans are:   Robyn (Richard "Dick" Grayson): Leader of the Group. Grew up with Batman (Bruce Wayne) after his parents were murdered. He's human, no super powers or anything. However, he's really acrbatic (his family were trapeze artists for a circus) and has all kinds of gagets. (Future: Nightwing) Personality: He's really Cool ^^    Raven (Raven is the only name she's had): Raven is the daughter of a union between Trigon the Terrible, a powerful extra-dimensional being, and Arella, a woman who was sued by a satanic cult to try to bring Satan to earth. She has magic-like powers.  (Future: Raven in White and Gold) Personality: She's very..uh..depressing and gets annoyed easly.   StarFire (Princess Koriand'r or Kory for short): Princess of the planet Tamaran. Her ability is to absorb the energy and then expel it in ferocious destructive blasts called Starbolts. Future: returns to Tamaran to be ruler.) Personality: Childish and fun, but can have a temper.   Cyborg (Victor Stone): After a fatal accident, Vic lost most of his body and was put back together with machinary by his scintist father (S.T.A.R. labs). (Future : becomes Omegadrome and then with DNA they create a new organic body for him.) Personality: The oldest, I think. He and Robyn have lil tiffs here and there.    Beast Boy (Garfield "Gar" Logan): He's Green. What else is there to say? He can change into any animal he wants too (they're green too). He's also the youngest of the group btw. (Furture: Changling) Personality: Very optimistic and and child like. He and Vic are together a lot playing video games and stuff.  Their Villans: (Only using three) The H.I.V.E. (The Hierarchy of International Vengeance and Extermination)   Jinx, Mammoth, and Gizmo. I don't know anything about them 'cause they weren't in the original series.  Check out pictures of them at http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/titans/index.html  And there ya go. Yes yes, i know I'm obsessive. ^^ But Dick's sooooooo cute! Any Anyway, I need you peeps ideas on who everyone should be. Obviously not everyone will be in it and it'll be a shortie (aka not like HP or LotR {which we still haven't finsh >  *singing* Lets Go! T E E N TITA N S Lets Go! T E E N TITA NS 1 2 3 4 Go! Teen Titans! When there's trouble you know who to call. Teen Titans! From their tower they can see it all. Teen Titans! When there's evil on the attack, you can rest knowing they have your back. To save the world, these heros are on partrol! Teen Titans! Go! With their super powers they unite. Teen Titans! Never ment to be they fight for light! Teen Titans! They have the bad guys on the run! They never stop with the jokes and fun! Even when the world is losing all control! Teen Titans! GO! 1 2 3 4 Go!

The funny part is that one begins vibratating as it moves to the other one. "This must be the boy dog..." I said. It was funny. Anyway....  Snarky- I'm reading HP5 and doesn't Umbridge remind you of Mrs. Zogby?!?!?!! OMG!!!!!!!!!! I had a dream with sirius and dragons last night... zZz...  I'm workin' on the comic! Really! I AM!!!

      My blog's being gay right now... *sigh* Snarky, I had a scary dream:   My mother and I were taking a walk. Our neighborhood was all underwater for some reason, but we found a path on dry land that led right into a forest. We decided to explore so we went in and found a little village. In the village were all sorts of monsters like grim reapers, skeletons, werewolves, imps, ghosts, gouls, anything you could think of. They were ravaging and pillaging the houses and killing the people. They ran off into the woods laughing and stuff. And then, after a few minutes, they came running out, CRYING in FEAR. Now I was scared out of my wits to see what would come out of the woods and would scare all of these terrifying creatures. And I was not prepared for what would come next.... It was YAMI BAKURA (yes, from Yu-gi-oh. I'm not kidding, I have a fear of that guy) He was laughing hysterically and he looked so.... demonic. The people of the village didn't know whether or not to call him their savior, or to be afraid of him. I wanted to leave, but it had gotten so dark that we couldn't....

      Some wonderfully funny jokes to cheer anyone *coughdavidcough* up.  When Mr. Monroe and his lovely assistant were traveling on business, they checked into a hotel that was overbooked and were told they'd have to share a room for one night. After the inital awkwardness, they tucked into seperate beds. "Mr. Monroe," the assistant called out in the dark, "I'm chilly. Would you mind getting me a blanket?" "I have a better idea," Mr. Monroe replied. "Why don't we pretend we're married, just for tonight." "I'd like that," said the assistant. "Good," said Mr. Monroe. "Then get your own blanket."  *  There's a knock at the front door. A man opens it and looks down to find a snail sitting on the stoop. He picks up the little creature and throws him as far as he can. Three years later, there's a knock. The man opens it, looks down, and there sits the same snail. The snail looks up and says, "What on earth was that about?"  *  Former Vice President Dan Quayle says that if you take out the profanity, the TV show "The Osbornes" is about good family value. You take out the profanity and "The Osbornes" is about 30 seconds long.  *  "I was walking on fifth avenue in Manhattan when I noticed a panhandler sitting on a box in front of the First Presbyterian Church. He was calling after passersby, "change, change, change." A young man in a business suit strode by and repied, "I'm trying. I'm trying."  *  "On my way to work one morning, I saw that someone was actually commuting in a Humvee. "Why would anyone drive such an ugly military vehicle for personal use?" I wondered as a drew closer to the truck. The Humvee's license plate answered my question. It read "4 NO RSN."

      Just a lil thing that has been cracking me up for a few days. As everyone knows (or should), alcohol is not allowed in state parks.  Monday Night, Mom and Dad walked out of the motorhome with a champane bottle. Mom: We don't have any alcohol. *the wine bottle's cork pops and echos in the forest*  *smacks her forehead while giggling* You have to love them sometimes. Now how many things do you know make that popping sound? lol

      So mew, thanx Des. No hurry. I think the new layout theme should be us as pirates, just cuz we did the pet shop one while we were planning a pet comic or us as animals comic or something, now, if you look on neo. and everywhere, we are all about us as pirates, so that should also be our blog theme. Any one agree? It will go well with when you finish the pirates comic and be released at the same time. be kinda cool. ::shurgs:: its 4 am..... I have been working on my new web site, to be opened soon, and its kick ass, better then anyone I've done thus far. I keep getting better and better at this shit haha.   O, btw, I called her earlier and said this but here again, HAPPY BIRTHDAT TAI!!!!! (Her b-days the 31) ::tear:: Our mouse is now 17..... were growing up so fast. Next year, we all get reality bound symbol tattoes for our 18th b-days...... except Des cuz I already know her mom won't let her get even the tiniest of any tatto, so guess I'll be first lol.  I want to any way, reality bound forever :-P     So, blah. 4 am...... tired, yet not. No room to sleep in. My rooms still not done, Didn't get any black paint to finish up, hopefuly tommarow. I can't put shit in there and sleep in there till its done. My sis and her bf are sleeping on the couch, and I am just no where to sleep, so I'm staying onthe comp till my dad goes to work and I can steal his bed. haha.

      font colors of your text? go to funky-chickens.com font is:   without spaces. F-C.com has a good color table with the hex #s under font.  BTW, I can across this quote and decided to share it with you guys ^^   "I'll carry the wench off," he muttered, experimentally dropping his voice half an octave, "and lock her in my dungeon." His voice returned to its normal pitch with a regretful sigh. "Except I haven't got a dungeon. It would have to be the closet. Grandfather's right, we are a reduced generation."  - Miles ponders the difficulties of villany. (Lois McMaster Bujold, The Warrior's Apprentice)  *grins*

      HAHAHAHAHA!!! I love my Ewan!  "I've got a black woolen hat and it's got PERVERT written across the front of it. It's the name of the clothing label. And I was with my wife and my baby at the supermarket and I didn't think. I just put my hat on Clara's head, because it was cold. And the looks. I couldn't figure out why I was getting death looks. And then I realized my 10-month old baby's wearing a hat with the word pervert written on it and these people were like, 'There's Satan! There's Satan out with his kid!' And then I made a point of her wearing it every time we went there." - Ewan, on an experience during filming A Life Less Ordinary in Denver, Colorado; Buzz Magazine March 1997

      okay, so the Batman and Robin theme has gone down the drain. Or has it? If I can find a green leitard and Bobicus can go to Halloween Adventure (next to blockbuster on Kirkwood, were Staples was years ago) and get a robin costume...We're still on then! Yay! *runs off to the balie dance store*  BTW, everyone remember to bring in money to buy lollipops (cherry, blue rasberry, green apple, and grape) and chocolate bars (w/ carmel, w/almonds, or w/crispies)! .75 for Lollipops and $1 for choco bars. Yay! candy!

      I feel like shit, I've felt like shit all week, and I'm kinda tired of hearing shit for it, but in other news, I'm prolly not gonna be in school today, I stuck a few half days and a whole one out this week, but I just can''t tommarow, especially when I gotta work 3-10... that i can not call out on, I need to rest and make sure I feel better to do them, use all my energy them come home to pass out.   yay on cream-o-land, ::waves tiny flag::   Boo to the movie boat trip and being to sick to get off tks floor tonight, Tk, if I didn have to take gnome home, I was bout to just sleep right there on the floor..... Yay to the hot guys in boat trip....  Haha, tonight me Tk and Gnome went food shopping, and got a glimpse of what It'll be like  year from now when we live together... were scared.. haha...  Oo, also in news, one thing that keeps me going is I almost have enough to buy my jeep... just another week or two, could be this week, but I wana wait till I have a lil over 1000 so insurnce is less.... then I get to start saveing up for the aprtment...   and college.. and hope theres some for christmas lol.   Btw, Kim, I owe you b-day presents, cuz we kinda got ur b-day bash cancled till next year cuz... evidently, through recent discussion and decisions... this is not our last year together... So you get a huge over done b-day next year and a small really late one this year haha (as in going out to dinner or soemthing on a day yet unknowen, or not whatever you want).   I tired really hard for your b-day, I really did, ask Tk, I tried to go out every weekend to plan and buy and stuff, and time is short, and good help is hard to find.    And sorry I have not been able to much plan things or coroperate as much and well as I should, but I do have my own life to plan for, my own future, and some things are takeing a back seat to it, and my jobs are takeing a lot of time and energy out of me and I've been a lil sick the past few weeks.   Also last thing thats on my mind that I will post here, I officially anounce this to me the last halloween party at my house. Well, at this house, cuz I will not be liveing here nor doing anything much here next oct. So lets try to make this year a good one. I'm trying kinda hard to get stuff for it and even thats been hard to do.    thats my last post for a while. So there ya go.

      OKay, I talked to Kelly today in spanish club, and Cream-O-Land is a go. ^^ Also, we have our place between the gym doors. And I have our $10 for Dry Ice in my agenda. So we're a go! ^^ I would really really REALLY opresate it if you guys get Katy and Tegan's e-mails (or if you have them give them to me. Dest- the pirate one didn't work) so we can add them in blogger. (You know I'll forget to ask them ^^;) Blogger could really help up organize things like today, everyone knows the name. And know when people get stuff; glitter, ect. And are done stuff. We have lass then three weeks to get this together but I know we'll do it. Go team!  --- There is no 'I' in team...but there is a 'me' if you look close enough ^^;

      Me and Tk watched a movie tonight about Giant Evil penises from space!!!!!!! It'll give me worse night mares then glowly inny outy things..... They were penises with ... eyes, and rows of teeth, and they likes to bites guys dicks off and if ya wana know aht i am talking about watch the Movie Dream Catcher. They are Evil penises I Swear!!!!!  Also me and Robyn Read a very wrong Book Today. Hey Bobicus... My genitals are starting to smell funky, is this normal??? Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha Inside joke from the book..... It was of sex questions no one really should ever Ask. FO course it did have a big page long explaination of herpes I was gonna photo copy for Tk lol  Also, I'll do the caption contest when I think of soemthing but right now I'm really tired.  Also, good on fixing the site, and adding all our memories is a good idea but everyone remember, don't post up your senior memories that you put in the year book, well not word for word, just to make things clear, cuz I think those will be best read when the books comes out. But do post anything u didn get to add and all moments that you want in memories.... did that make sense. Ah well.....  Ummmm.  ummmm.....  Time Line, ah yeah.... we'll get to it.... maybe one day after coffee.... but since someone never wants to hang out with us anymore no wonder we don't get anything done...... especially now that I work all the time.   ::Eats the left over mozzarella stix from tonight::  Anything, else any thing else??? I think Not, ttyl, need to go to bed, 14 hour work day tommarow!!!!

And I think that's it. i know I'm being a pain in the ass, but I need this stuff so the site looks cool! site being: http://www.geocities.com/demonangelwolf/realitybound or just click  urlLink Here   Thanks you guys. now I'm off to Charoltte...tomorrow morning ^^;

Hell, just hang out. You're just happy being around your boyfriend.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    oO;;;  Anyway, Hey D.

        -Not- You're...not girlfriend material. Not because you'd be a bad girlfriend, but because you're not in the mindset to be one. You're childish and silly. Also, you might not necessarily be attracted to guys. ~shrugs~ whatever.    urlLink   What Kind of Girlfriend Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla

      -^ ^- I'm sorry, I'm such a pant stealer.  For those who don't know (are absent or Gnome) Connor has asked to leave the table. He wants to be with people his own age. We are letting him go. Why? Cause he hasn't seemd to be part of the group since Dest broke up with him. *shrugges* Thoughts, Questions, Comments? No good.

I find this funny!      Even When I was young, I had a think for dick and ass......    No, I wasn't gay growing up.... No.... lol.

      BTW, everyone I had to order your x-mas presents this year, but since i've had no time to till lately, they will be shipped really late, like may not get here till january, so you'll prolly get my preants late this year, depending on when they ship, you know chirstmas chipping is slow as fuck, grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr. It'll be worth it though.

      k. first about that adoptable thingy of me... could we possibly make it a shadowy figure.  just cause. nice and background-ish   and also for The Stuff Your Face Till You Have ChipMunk Cheeks-Athon ... i like that name... i start work at 5 that day, but i get off at 9. so, maybe i can find someway to get there later. but i would indeed like to come. maybe i could bring a desert of some sort since if i come it'll be late. pumpkin pie or cheesecake(homemade if i have the time) maybe?  and brian thinks we are odd for having a thankgiving celebration the day after thankgivings? does he not like large amounts of especially yummy food? and jello sounds just nifty.

      agh! *slams head on keyboard* These pirate adoptables are coming slow. So is Robyn. Yes, I'm making you adoptable Bobicus ^^ however, it just can't seem to come out right. Dest needs to draw you in RB form, then perhaps I'll get it right. Speaking of Dest *hinthint* Your lucky I probably won't see you tomorrow, otherwise I'd be bugging you about coloring and clothing and everything that I need for pirate adoptables! O! Speaking of tomorrow, since you guys probably won't have a very good show, it being our first time putting things together (*eye twitchs* Tornado watch my @$$!) Perhaps you all should come to the Saturday night (7pm) performance and see us all at our best! And Support your Snarky! This is my last Showstoppers! *sniff sniff*

      WEE! *dances in a circle* I got honors! *stops and actually thinks about it* woh...i did good... ^^ Yes! Where were you slackers! We should have stolen TK's report card from Hanel, Bobicus. ;P Underwater cows? is this a quote I should put up? And why do I get the image of a drawing that Dest would do with a Cow swimming with swimming goggles and that snokle thing? Oo;  Anyway... THANKSGIVING! D needs to put up all the details but I'm in! ^^ I can make Deviled Eggs, and a cake- I need to go find a turkey cake pan-, someone what to make and bring in jell-o? We always had jell-o on our Thanksgiving table (till family peeps got too old and we started to go out to a fancy pansy restruants...fancy pansy rich stuff...I feel so poor when I'm around my aunt >

Absolutley nothing Robyn ::wink::....  It was great trip, We went to the Aquarium... O Btw Robyn Tanya was in the pool feeding the turtle, we did see her. :)   It was great, and Me and Andrew were all holding hands and being cute everywehre, and every 5 mins robyn said "Aww, you guys are so cute" haha, it was fun, I enjoyed haveing both of them there. After the aquarium we ate at hard rock coffe, and went to a huge huge huge 3 story tall barns and noble. Then to a cool mall where we shoped, and walked around and stole a few things....  and some lady came up and told us we were so cute holding hnads haha... and We rode in a glass elevator where robyn was avoiding seeing em and Andy make oout...  It was all fun hehehe :)  and me and Andy are officially Bf and Bf now btw... but I ghtg breaks over, ttyl, byeee

      I'ma leader not a follower. D's a leader too. And I drag Dest around so technically she isn't a follower either. Assia just randumly comes and goes so she's not a follower. Bobicus too, here there everywhere poof. Tai has too many Boyfriends to be a follower. Tegan will whack you if you even try and say she's a follower. So I guess you army consists of Katy and Connor. Poor You.

So, Gnome will be giving air kisses and "from there" hugs to everyone. And if we play Twister or Battle of the Sexes or whatever, I dunno if I'll play. But Gnome loves all of you!!  So Drew, call me later, okies? 633-3988. Joy. See ya!

      I was talking to janine, and I just remembered this this morning...  "Welcome to Who's line is it anyway- A game where the points don't matter! That's right- the points are like Michael Jackson's nose... they're not really there!"  I said that! OMG!! I said something clever!! OO*

      It's not Christmas because no one is in the spirit. No one is feeling giving or happy. All they care about is shop shop shop and decorating their house etc. Can't we all just pause for a minute and tell anyone, "merry Christmas." Or  Jesus loves you  or something! I MEAN COME ON PEOPLE!!!!!!!!!!!   *sniff*   Jesus loves you. :D  (This was Censored, David had to save the masses and his eyes, else beat Des.)    *dodges glares and types of hard things*

      Snarky's Restraunt Report: Tonight's place - Jose's Border Cafe (The place on the way to Christanna Mall with the huge "EAT" sign) Atmosphere: Lots of noise and loud colors. Very lively place. Wait time at peak: 40-45 minutes Food: Very, very hot! If you like spicy stuff, you'll love this place. (Personally, I don't like hot stuff, and tacos shouldn't be hot!) Drinks: Very, Very nice Margaritas. (*grins*) Prices: Low for both food and drinks, probably the reason there are tons of people there all the time. Kids?: Yes, there are tons of kiddies and there are two kids menus (lil and big) Rating (1-10): Food: 5, Over all: 6-7

      Shark-bait: Well, if you need help with circus stuff, look at us. Especially TK, he's such a  fat clown. And I can say that 'cause he never come on here. Meta: Take a deep breath. Only a few more months and you and TK are moving down to the beach, right? Bobicus: I get the money thing. If you fail you get a penalty type thing, it's cool. We'll help you pass. And, why are you obsessed with Shatner?  ALSO META : Bobicus and I both need the assignment so please just post it here. And we'll pray that he'll accept them on Monday/Tuesday.

( gnome - you might actually get a dollar if i pass.... maybe. )   yes i will put the cash stuff in writing .... signatures, all the particulars, ya da ya da ya da...  and somebody please find a copy of that god foresaken, useless, piece of crap(*) paper for killhefer for me....   enough ranting.. i have to finish getting ready for work.  almost at car .... so close

      Ok... I am about to snap.... I've reach my point of agression again.... I'm done.... I can not lie here any more.... I can't keep being bullshitted out of my life.... I can not just be so disapointed in these people and so resenting of these people and look at them every day any more... I'm seriouse.... i'm to a its them or its me point....  let me back track.... they put furniture again in the liveing room.... and that was my last personal spot besides my room in the house.... they sit out here, watch tv, talk all loud to me, fight with each other and me next to me.... won't let me get to the comp. when I need to any more... I mean I need this shit for school and work now and I can't get on it when I need and when I can I can't work cuz I can not sit and work with a tv in my ear and someone bitching at another....  I'm thinking.... David... Your only 17 for a few more months... a few more months you can me tried as a minor.....  I don't know I'm just sooooo built up anger from this week rebubbleing....  but seriousely as I reach the end... I also reach my breaking point... either I'll turn 18 and leave, kill someone, or kill myself... which one will come first.... I'm fine anywhere else with any one else..... I need... out.... and I've run out of options..... I could get a loan and get a place, but I'm to young.... or I could ..fuckin....  put more money in to my room.... get a comp. and microwave and my own line so i really don't have to get out... but that'll take a few more months.... I don't know if I have that long.... I want jess dead... i want it now..  Any one have space in their house for 5-6 months.... anyone?? Tk... I know you do!!!!

TK: Destinie, Pharoahs didn't wear pleather pants, either.  TK: I'm going to have 28 sons...all of them boys.  Assia: No one calls Fat Tony a pigeon... Crooo!  TK: I'm okay with Herpes, just give me the lollipop.  Tegan: I like Random elves, they're fun.  Tegan: It's a side of Destinie I've never seen before- TK: The Fortune Cookie Side!  Tk: Streakers should not play with nails.  Tk: Why is it called Homecoming if I have to leave my home to get there?  Destinie: ... And then the chickens said: "It was workin' for the cows!" Everyone else: ......................................................................................................  (That would be us in Art Class o_O)  And we can't forget... The Hanel Ho-down:  Swing your partner left to right Draw tin foil in the light Kick 'im in the shins, like you're mad Then put on a shirt that's plad Jump around like your free Talk about your A.D.D

      If anyone is up for a good laugh or finding out why people say if you look back at what you thought years ago you'd be embarrassed, could you take a look at the quote page (  urlLink Here!  ) and tell me if I made any mistakes. Like I misspelled something or have ; instead of : Those kind of things. I'm updating later, so yeah. Thanks!

      And again... no school. Are we ever going to take the last two mid-terms? This does mean a four day (five for Snarky!) weekend. If they let us take the tests tomorrow and make-up is friday. Anyways, glad you liked the quote ^^ I'm going to go play on neo now.

      ooo, and before i forget. I just have to put this quote on here, I think some of you might find it funny. (it's from a fanfic! ^^) ~ "How many fingers am I holding up," Daniel asked, trying to gauge Jack's current level of intoxication.   "Seven," Jack said, squinting mightily.   "I'm only holding up one hand."   "Yeah? So what's your point?"   "My point is that you should just proceed directly to passing out," Daniel said sharply. "Do not pass go, do not collect the archaeologist's ass."   "Awww," Jack complained.  ~ *giggles insanely*

Tuesday: off Wednesday: 2-9:30 Thursday: off Friday: 12-4, show 6:30-11:30 Saturday: 12-4, show 6:30-11:30 Sunday: off  Hehehe. That's great. I'm gonna go eat now, and call my boyfriend.

      mewmew!! Gnome has returned! And due to the snow, she got off work all early and stuff today. Coolies. Gonna go call the boyfriend in a bit. I just wanted to tal kto all of you,oh and give directions for my show.   Well, I can't find them. I'll search. I can't find the address to the theatre. I will later. Anyway.  $5 for ya'll that are under 18 $10 for everyone else. The shows are: One about these stupid doctors on their first day. One about a ghost that talks to a guy who's trying to commit suicide because he's pregnant. One is about these actors that suck and a critic that is an asshole. Then intermisson. Then there's one about a cat turned into a woman and the scientist that made her. One's about two kids that are waiting for Santa. Then mine. Four women meet in a liposuction clinic and share their stories with each other.  Anyway, you're allowed to bring your own drinks and food and such. it's a quaint little theatre.  Talk to you kids later.

      For those who don't know, Meta, Gnome, Shark-Bait, and Snarky packed up and went to the beach to live with TK for a night and watch the ball drop. D came up with this plan 3 hours before we left > Bobicus, We heard it on a comedian showy thingy.  Memories!  We are so in the car!  and of course    99 bottles of dick on the wall, 99 bottles of dick! Take one down fuck it around, 98 bottles of dick on the wall!    Censored for the youngins on the blog ^^ Highlight it if you are mature.  BTW, my parents told me about this when I got home. Down in Key West, one of the islands off Flordia and is a very gay community, has a very special dropping of the ball. They lower a drag-queen in a giant red shoe. I guess it's dropping of the balls. ^^

      http://www.petitiononline.com/mrphelps/petition.html  (Casper, Wyoming) Anti-gay preacher Fred Phelps has announced intentions to erect a monument to Matthew Shepard the gay college student brutally murdered five years ago near Laramie.   But, the monument will be no memorial. Phelps says the monument would be 5 to 6 feet tall and made of marble or granite. It would bear a bronze plaque bearing the image of Shepard and have an inscription reading "MATTHEW SHEPARD, Entered Hell October 12, 1998, in Defiance of God's Warning: 'Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind; it is abomination.' Leviticus 18:22."   The monument would be erected in downtown Casper, Shepard's home town. Phelps has sent details of the monument to the city of Casper city council and there may be nothing the city can do to prevent it. Phelps said he intends to put up the monument in City Park, already the location of a controversial statue of the Ten Commandments.   The Ten Commandments statue was donated to the city by the Fraternal Order of the Eagles in 1965. After a court battle over a similar monument in the city of Ogden, the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that any city that displays a Ten Commandments monument on public property must also allow monuments espousing the views of other religions or political groups on that same property.   Phelps told Casper council in his letter that if it attempts to prevent him from erecting the homophobic monument he's prepared to go to court.   "That is exactly what I said would happen," said Councilwoman Barb Watters. She said she warned the city when it accepted the Ten Commandments statue that the city risked other monuments advocating anti-Semitism and hatred of other minorities.   "I think the hate language will find a very cold reception in this community," councilor Paul Bertoglio said. "I think this community's backbone is going to come up and say 'We are not going to accept it.'"   The city council is looking at several options, one is fighting Phelps in court, another is moving the Ten Commandments out of the park, and yet another proposal would be to sell the land the park is on. Phelps says he doesn't care what the city decides. If he is unable to put the statue in City Park he said he will find another location in the city.   During Shepard's funeral members of Phelps' Westoboro Baptist Church demonstrated in front of the chapel.   Article  365Gay.com, 2003

      Poor Snarky.  I called you this AFTERNOON but you were asleep and I had the english info for you: Samuel Taylor Coleridge. =_= I'm sleepy today. I couldn't sleep either. (SUGAR HIGH!!) I went to bed at... 12:30-1am?? I got up at 8 and laid in bed. Blah. Went to church and he talked about Hell. Nice, huh? I think that quiz needed more results so we all won't repeat. Some of the answers didn't fit me well, I think.  "Oops, I dropped 5,000 Yen..."  "I will curse you so that everytime you go to the bathroom there will be no paper and you will have to wipe with the color inserts from your favorite magazines!!!!"

      ugh...I can't sleep. I keep thinking about Gnome's wizard topic and David's "I will swim till I fall" song by the guy with the alto 1 voice who's name I currently can't remember. Anyway, I'm laying here and I'm like, "okay, I need to take my mind off this topic. I know, I'll go watch Stargate." 'Cause during the day everyone else is either watching  my  Stargate dvds or one the computer which is currently the only comp. with a dvd drive (the other one's drive won't open for some reason o -;) Anyway, I'm half asleep and forming this plan, "I can sleep during the day and do my outlines tomarrow night..." when I suddenly hear the steps creak. Like someone is going down them and is trying to be quiet but they can't do it and hitting the gate at the bottom sure as hell isn't quiet or sneaky. Anyway, who ever it was went into the parent room (parent room- orginally was the guest room until Danny got his toys everywhere in the living room and you really couldn't live in it so we fixed the guest room up with the rule of no toys allowed and the room with said computer above.) >      urlLink Which Pirates of the Caribbean character are you?

      ugh, I need to take Dest's quiz, and go to Shark-Bait's links, and I will, just not now. Snarky ish busy (that is not a typo). I need to know what people want to do about a .com domain. Well, do we want a .com, .net, or.org domain? The resone I bring this up is 'cause we're running out of room on geocities. I don't think we could get one more comic on. We could get another geocities name and store the comics on there or we could get a domain, but we have to pay. Personally I think getting another geocities would be best for now, considering we haven't really done anything.  Oh! I was reading Megatokyo (vol. 2) and Saw they do a monday, wednesday, and friday update. They're short 4 to 6 panel comics, and I remember we wanted to try that but...never did. Mostly to lack of plot. Do we wish to try this again or should we stay with the long comics? (speaking of which, I need to scan LOTR... *looks at scanner* ... *looks at the over a hundred pages in a floder waiting to be scanned* ...later...) If we do do weekly(once, twice, three times whatever) , we could do real life stuff like we ment to at the beginning.  *~*~*~* Example: Snarky: A year ago, you couln't mention the word "Pokemon" without Meta going on an endless rant that usually ended up with two or more people comitting suicide to make the noise stop. Snarky: However, after one beach trip on new years eve, i think something changed that. *Snarky, Meta, and Shark-Bait are on a bed, each with gameboy advances, Meta and Snarky are linked by a game cable* Snarky: *blink blink* he..beat me... - -; Meta: *grins* My *enter pokemon here* beat your *enter pokemon here*'s ass! Snarky: *looks at Shark-Bait* Shark-Bait: O O *in pain* Snarky: You better get off him or you won't be getting your prize tonight. *~*~*~* A sad true story. ^^; Anyway, questions, concerns and comments?

Kim: What is that? Destinie: A brick. Kim: I see that. WHY DO YOU HAVE A BRICK?! Destinie: Some guy traded it to me. He said it had magic powers. Kim: !!!! .... What did you trade?!?! (Sees the guy walk by with a gold ring thing around his neck) Kim: NO NO NONONONONNOOOO! COME BACK!!! ARG!

How can one get away with cutting if in a group? With Mrs. Freeman, she might decide she doesn't like this and have us all in detention or suspended or something. I'm not too sure about doing this.

      Ok, so i must share this...  Shark-Bait Gave me his old gameBoy Advance cuz I was tired of my old thing sucking when I was bord and played it.... and when I asked what game I should get for it.... he said to get the one Kim plays... so I did, so we went out and got a pokemon something game, its blue... whale thing on front.... any way whats funny is I was playing it... and I named my first lil thing Fucker... so it kept yelling "Go Fucker!!" and I laughed.  My next one was a brown racoon thing called Ma'Nigga "Go, Ma'Nigga!" and I was once again amused...  but what was really funny was I named my third one Dick.... and then later it said and I quote... in this order...  "Your Dick is evolveing, Your Dick has learned harden, Trainer Gives you Great balls"  but what was really funny

I look like the guy from.... that cartoon... umm.. umm... damn forget it....  Oh, whats up with the sweet post it?    All in all I love the picture and and.... I don't care what weekend we have the party, but one weekend we party, and another we gotta eventually see Gnome get her one act on....    Ya know... in this picture the symbol looks like a disgruntled G..... and I think we should keep kims hari up like that in every picture for now on... hahahahahahahaha

      Okay, First: the 8th is looking good. Second, my arms aren't exploding. I'm falling so they're waving really fast. Of course that means I would fall onto TK & his scythe, the latter going into Dest's head, the sudden decapitation will startle Randum who with bite D outta fright, who will hit the ladder, and tai, trying not t fall, will grab the rest of the banner which will land on us all. Then Bobicus will walk in, look around, grab a economics book, and leave.

        Yay! Reality Bound is now 4 yrs old!  Congrates to everyone who has survived this long! As per usual, we  would  celebrate with a party at lunch, however, I will not be there on monday and Monday is T's birthday. So, instead of a gave-to-eat-quick-before-lunch-is-over deal, how about we make it into a party at one's house? Besides, this way Gnome and Shark-Bait can partake in the feastivities. Yes? First we need a house, second we need everyone's permission to go. So basically, it's an all or nothing. I'll print up offical invites to you all can give to your parents/yourselves. Also need a date. Is everyone good this coming weekend (7-8) or should we have it next next weekend (14-15)? I  need  feedback people. Don't ignore this post like you do my others, k?       BTW, thanks for the paper D. However I still don't understand the project. This proves what?

      'Tis a Gnome again. If anyone has NOTHING better to do this Saturday then go to Middletown to see a Gnome and an Elam in a show (we get married twice!!) Then come see the one act festival at the Everett Theatre in Middletown. It's a competition, if we win we go to  regional competition (like I did last year.........)  Here's directions: Get on I95 South.  Take the Rt 7S/S1 (Christiana Mall Road) Exit.  Go to the left (do NOT get on Christiana Mall Road!). Stay on Route 1.  Follow Route 1 for about 16 miles. There is a tollbooth.  Take Exit 136 (RT 299 to Odessa/Middletown). Bear right toward Middletown.  Rt 299 becomes MAIN STREET. About 2 miles after the exit, you'll see the EVERETT THEATRE on your right. The address is 45 West Main Street.  There's also some other way to do it without hitting the toll........... going on South 13 and making a right towards 299 West or something..... if you really wanna find out, come early and get lost. Not expecting to see any of you, but it'd be cool if ya'll came. Pretty sure it's free?? Dunno. See you kids later!!!

I'll call TK and Andy's cell phones around 2 (latest I can call) and then again around five. SO......... yeah. David, Kim, TK, Andy, Robin.......... anyone who can drive........ I'll give you gas money for taking me home.......... I just don't wanna go to Rodney Square at like 7:30 at night. It's dark and I'm tiny............ And I'm rambling. Love ya'll PLEASE someone come hang out with me!!!!!!!

      Ok.... who wants to hear the newest STUPID thing in my house....its the first time I've been home for dinner in like weeks, so when I got home, my moms like, oh, theres dinner for you in the kitchen. And so i ate the 3 slices of turky that were in there....  Allen coems home, and throws a shit fit, cuz I ate the last of the dinner, and nothings left for him.... and I'm like Wtf.... 3 slices of turky... and your bitching, when I have to go out every night and scroung around for food and shit. And The one day I eat at home, allens makeing a huge deal I ate 3 slices of turky.  And theres other things they can make....  I turned to my mom I said This is your answer to why I never come home. . Cuz just last night she was complaining I'm never home any more, and I spend time with other peoples familys and eat out every night or eat at Andys. I also said, i'm sorry i forgot, i'm the younger one meaning I must suport myself, and your 22 so you should live off mommy.   {edit}  Robyn, on the caption contest. YOU CAN'T VOTE FOR YOUR SELF IF YOU DIDN'T MAKE A CAPTION! Now, people, make a caption, Kim repost the picture. Maybe they missed it. And like I said we should make trophy cabinets or something to show when and how many times people win, so theres more incentive. Just steal a trophy inage from neo. and put our own words on it hahaha. or something.

"o, well i just sold it."  umm... gir.  but anyhoo. oh and peoples, i don't know quite what i'm doing with this stupid swann notetaking so if anyone wants to help.. then please do.  that is all.

      i thought harry was a bit to moody in the 5th book.. and stupid... and you can't stop reading them cause sirius is gone.. he wasn't there when ya started the books. .. and i like that insult.. but it depends on what time period your in.. cause most of em' used to be on opium.  and no.. i have no intention on elaborating on baltimore.. the topic is done with. and would you stop commenting on that stupid ferry already. people died, be polite.  also, i don't know what anime we have.. there was some dragon knights and some other stuff, but i don't know what.  and DOUBLE POSTING!!!! ... um...

      Yay! Anime! Which ones?  And on the side note: I haven't been to ff.net in a long while. I went there mostly for HP fics but then HP5 came out and... that book made me leave the series. No, no because of Sirius, Bob. It just...didn't go. All famous writers are usually on crack when they write they're stuff. She obviously wasn't. (How's that for an insult? ^^;)

      Another side note here: I went to fanfiction.net after about 2 years because I'm here in the library after skool being bored. Anyway, I stumbled into the anime section and was like: OMG! Because remember how digimon had the most entries in fanfics, it was like 8000+? They're being beat by yu-gi-oh. Anyway, I found that amusing. XD Okay, I'm done now.

      Bobicus, can you e-mail me your #? I can put it directly into my phone directory. Thankies! -^ ^-  BTW, the Baltimore Tripy Idea... Lets do it tomorrow. Kim was just outside a-swinging and ... I'm soaked. - -;  Can the caption contest- I'll post a link when I get two quotes and make a quiz. Oh! Since Shark-Bait is new, I shall explain the Caption Contest Rules!  *ahem* Everyone in Reality Bound is allowed to join in on this game. What you do is look at the piccy that is up and post a quote that is funny that goes with the piccy. I take the posted quotes and put them on a page on my site and put a poll up. Everyone then has 3 days (yes I changed it) to vote on their favorite caption. I then look at the poll results and put up whose the winner. David has suggested we have trophies. I think that's a good idea so I'm in the process for making that page. Also, I made a trophy.. put others can probably do better then I did.

        urlLink        You are  Mitsurugi  -   Both mysterious and attractive, you captivate people with the fact that you seem to be good at everything! Spending quiet moments with a friend and talking about what life means to you is your ideal situation. You don't like to stand out very much and you seem to be more old-fashioned than modern, but when you do take the spotlight -- you command the floor!     urlLink Which Soul Calibur character are you?    this quiz was made by  urlLink david park

        urlLink        You are  Nightmare  -   Nightmare is by far the most badass character in the game. Similarly, you are badass. You are aggressive and you are a straight-dealer, people who dilly-dally and waste your time piss you off. Sometimes your temper runs a little short and the people around you suffer as a result, however, it's all just a matter of how you deal with stress. You don't want to be messed with and people know it...that kinda respect does not come as easily to other weaklings. Oh...and if you're ever around a casting call for a villain in a Hollywood movie, AUDITION!    urlLink Which Soul Calibur character are you?    this quiz was made by  urlLink david park    boo-ya!

You're the kind of person that loves to be in control, but be careful not to flaunt this power that seems to come so naturally to you. You get indifferent at times and tend to deviate from the normal path and carve your own way through life. Being stubborn, sensual, and independent is what makes you this staff-wielding favorite.   urlLink Which Soul Calibur character are you?

      *giggles* We'll kidnap Shark-Bait at noon.  Oh! *laughs* I am  never  going to wear my cross bracelet again. You all saw that I was wearing it, ne? Well, I went to the swings, and I was still wearing it. I guess the big man up there decided to punish me for wearing a cross, but I was in mid-swing and the swing broke. Good thing was I was on my way back down, better then being all the way at the top! But anyway, I fell onto the mulch stuff on my shoulder, my neck and head, I'm in great pain. But I just sat there laughing cause it went with the music! I was imagining I was being chased by a 'raptor down on of the hallways at school, I tried to duck into a room but the 'raptor got to the door first and I was thrown across the floor. Next thing I know I'm on the ground. *giggles* It was such great timing! ^^  I'm going to go be in pain but first...     urlLink          You are Astaroth  -   Your combination of being both silly and scary is what makes you appealing. It just cracks people up when they see you goof around at one time, and stare people down at another time. Your unpredictability may confuse some, annoy some, and amuse others, but whatever happens, you're too caught up with your own thing to conform to other people's standards. Besides that, the id seems to be the dominant force in your mind (the part of the mind which demands immediate gratification)     urlLink Which Soul Calibur character are you?    this quiz was made by  urlLink david park    I uh...like the axe-y thing.. ^^;

      For anyone who played and loved the first one, (Me Gnome, Kim, prolly Des.) By late this year there will be out, Kingdon Hearts ll! I saw it in a mag. in the library today and saw the website today, say new worlds and some old one so hope they kept Halloween Town :). The new Sora (dressed in all black rather then micky dressed one) looks cool. This should be cool, but still won't beat the Nightmare Befor x-mas ll Game, comeing out in fall :)  Also, I should have our prom pictures up on my website by like wensday if ya wana see them.

      I'll take care of the books Gnome, you'll be paid back in full.  I'd type more but I'm not in the best frame of mind at the moment and wish to avoid an angered rant which would most likely contain an array of profanities the like of which I refuse to allow t osoil the blog. Stupid, bloody, plaua-strooken blog...

      David, the one I told you about, Merlin's Disciples or something  CANNOT  be renewed, it got recalled b/c someone else needs it. The rest I can try to renew, but if there's any late fees incurred, you guys need to pay them.  ~*~Gnome goes tro Library website and clicks "renew all" ~*~  ~*~ list of "non-renewed items" included all books~*~  ~*~Gnome growls in frustration~*~  Ok, books can't be renewed. So...... bring them back when you can, I'll let you guys know how much money gets charged on them, and we can figure things out.  BTW, if ya don't believe me...... www.lib.udel.edu . Click DELCAT. Click "Sign In". Put in Gnome's SSN and password (email me for it if ya want it). Click "Books I Have Checked Out". Click "Books etc" next to the number 36. Try the "Renew All" link. A Window will pop up and say "non-renewed items". All the books overdue will be listed. Which is  ALL  the books. Sorry gang.

      I'm glad our prom pics came out good. Unfortunally, my camera turned out to be pretty useless... *cries* half of them are blurry and the other half are icky! *cries some more*  And your all probably not wondering why I'm still up but just so you all know, I was playing Okage: Shadow King. It's fun ^^ Except when you die and you forgot to save so you have to go backa few pages >  Anyway! I'm going to try and get some good photos up on my website after I delete the red eyes and stuff and we'll go from there.  Snarky Out.

Drove all the way home after after prom and dropping Kim off. Was damn tired when I got home, woke up and went to work after dropping shark-bait off. Everyone was like, WTF are you doing here, you should be passed out somewhere? I was like... i need the money. Then,  I saw our prom Pics. some are really cute :)   HAPPY B_DAY DES!!!!! Whoo-OOOO ya know what this means..... we need to get you a reality bound tatoo.... hehehe j/k you don't have to.

      Hey ya'll. So, it REALLY woulda been cool if I had got that money back. Know why? Cuz Gnome ain't got a job no more! Yay, I got canned from Payless!!  Anyway. Working on my Art History paper right now. TOTALLY not gonna get this thing done, I have no idea what to write, ALL YOUR LIBRARY BOOKS ARE DUE TODAY!!!  Yeah. Anyway, I just sent an email to David and TK, dunno other emails.... Yeah. Just get the books back. I am only allowed to go to the movies if I have three pages written by the time you guys wanna leave. So, Someone call me about this movie thing, and basic times. ~*~sigh~*~ it sucks to be jobless and covered in homework. See ya'll.

You all were probably the walking dead this morning, I know I was! My hair was *poof!* lol! Anyway, if anyone wants to do someting this weekend, say movie?, lets all meet somewhere, ne? Dest, we could try and go to the regal near you if your Mom doesn't want to drive you anywheres...  Anyway, I'm tired so I'm going back to bed ^^  Snarky Out.

      It'd be great if we could find someone to buy my ticket. Even an annoying person we don't like...... cuz that money would be great. Someone call TK and tell him his sister needs to buy my ticket. D, when did you check with Miss P about my money, and why didn't ya call me about it? mewmew..... it woulda helped to know that I couldn't get the money on Monday, cuz then I coulda like given you a note or done something, or talked to my mom about getting the $$ I need for my textbook. ~*~sigh~*~ oh well. I guess I'll call TK tonight..... bithcy moment: it seems when I say anything on here, it goes un-noticed.... no one emailed me or called me or anything about my ticket situation... and if ya'll didn't call me, that means ya'll didn't do it until today or something........ which makes me wonder why ya didn't do it on Monday. BUt anyway, just a random bitchy moment, and go ahead and get angry at me for being self-centered, but oh well. Bitchy moment over.  D, I can't renew your book, it's been recalled by the library for another user. So, I'm gonna need you to get it back as fast as you can, and we'll talk something over about late charges or something. I dunno. ~*~sigh~*~ Gotta go catch a bus, so I'll talk to ya'll later. Have fun at prom, and after-prom, and whoever's house. Love ya'll!

      My Dad, D, and I came up with a plan! *dun dun dun* >>;  Anyway, on Friday. We all meet at school at, say...6:30. Everyone brings their own cars and parks them in the parking lot. From there we take the motorhome to the Prom. Then we take the motorhome to After Prom. Thus, all our cars are there, everyone can leave when they want, etc. etc. What we're doing from then on, I don't know. Someone come up with something!

I got a 4.4 but I don't think that has anything to do with it. ^^ My mom went on a field trip so he probably couldn't take me to and from the bus stop.

      Bennet wasn't doing anything, so i'm in the library right now. i'm prolly gonna go play zuma in a few minutes... who knows, bored outta my mind.  There is this horrible gigantic-mutant-cricket-like sound echoing through the halls and the library... ugh... it's just awful. it's really Really loud. it made my ears vibrate. Supposedly, it's a new alarm they are setting up for the outside door by the library - apparently they haven't worked out all of the bugs yet... it's been going for the past 6 minutes.  yay. it stopped. finally. hope i don't have to hear That to often.  I'm kinda tired. i wasn't tired earlier but now that i'm bored it's kicking in. i was up till 4am last night working on that stupid swann project.  "heckboy"  i think after school i'm gonna go to Payless and get some cheap sandals. i need some new ones. they're having some kinda sale, right?  oh, and if we are taking the motorhome, let me just say have fun getting to my house.. i believe you've all seen the roads in my neighborghood. not very motorhome accesible i don't think.  gonna go play zuma now.

      Maybe double sided sticky tape on the m-home. ::shrugs:: Any way... I'm tired, but not tired, yet tired still, and can't sleep so I'm sitting here.... been sitting here since well... I don't know when.... seems right. For some reason at this hour in this morning everythings odd to me.  ::shrugs again::  I feel very... misplaced.... not lost just misplaced.  Its hard to explain.  I'm just very bothered by many things right now, and would love to kill something, like jess.... ah how nice would it be to kill her, or see her killed, or at least seriously hurt, like the girl with her arm hanging out her car window while she slept in the passenger seat... yea... that'd be nice.   I'm tired.... I'm tired of many things... I'm tired of trying hard.... I'm tired of failing....  If I slept... I fear I wouldn't allow myself to wake up.....  my secret motto... keep going.... its failing me...   If I left... I'd never look back..... but since I yet can't get too far... I come back here to hate myself... for being stuck... is there no where else for me...  yea...Misplaced.... lets just get some double sided sticky tape.....

      Well, he would pick us up too, hopefully... Little problem with a few people and very tight and narrow streets that aren't made for a motorhome... but I think we'll be okay. Dad says anything we put on the motorhome will probably fly off by the time we get there...and no super glue, it must come off... (spoiled sport) :p We'll try our best with your ticket Gnome.

      ~*~sighs~*~ My mom was actually kinda pissed at me for wanting to go to prom. She gave me a lecture on spending my money on going to a dance at a school I've been out of for two years, and I'm supposed to be saving my money, and all that. So, here's hoping Ms. P will be cool and refund  my cash (make up something, say I have a funeral or some crap, cuz I actually need that money, just found out that I need to buy another textbook RAT BASTARD TEACHERS!!!!!!). Oh, Payless is having Buy One Get One Half Off today up until the 3rd, so get your shoes with a buddy at Payless! Shameless plug.  I love you guys...... and I hate financial aid, and college, and textbooks, and rat bastard teachers, and essay papers, and registering for classes.  Bleh. we should have our own prom every year. Rent a fire hall, dress up, make someone cater it, and just dance for the hell of it. And only invite people WE like. And charge everyone ticket prices, therefore it pays for itself!! MWAHAHAHAHA!!! Just a Gnome idea. I need to go register for classes now, and make a page in a scrapbook....... anyone wanna get a Gnome tomorrow after 5 and go to A.C. Moore? It'll be fun, we can start our own scrapbooking!! ~*~sigh~*~ See ya'll later.

      *ignores being ignored* anyway, motorhome sounds just fine to me ... really amusing actually... but we must have a picture of a limo on the side. .. and yes, apparently, i'm going to prom. got off work for it yesterday.  gotta go to payless and get my shoes.. yay! cheapness. .. but if your dad drives us.. how would we get home ..   and also .. concerning afterprom... i honestly don't care. you can have fun and plan that all you want kim.. however, if it involves the rest of the weekend.. i must point out that  as of right now  i gotta be at work by 10 on Saturday.   ummm, see you all monday...... 'cept gnome. ---- and this vacation is sooooooooooo not long enough. i could really do with another week and a half of no school... i mean ... COME ON .. i still know what day it is!!! where's my loss of time concepts people .. WHERE's MY LOSS OF TIME?!?  and i just heard .. this is just hear-say mind you ... that it's supposed to rain on friday. oooh. shock.   need . . . .  more  . . . . . vacation..... must  . . . . go . . .  to . . . . bahamas .... or . . .  spa . . .

      *ignores Bobicus* Yesh, well. D, TK, and I were talking and TK thinks it's too late to get a limo for prom. Thus, I propose that my Dad take us in the motorhome! To which D came back with, we can decorate it and put a limo pic on the side! TK just looked at us strangely. Either way, what do you guys think of that? It'll have all the comforts of a limo, only with a bed, bathroom, and refrigerator. *grins* And what are we going to do about after prom? I don't wanna go, it sucked last year. Personally I think it's a Junior thing. However, Dest, Random, and KT already have "plans". So, what we going to do. I need to know your input ASAP.  BTW, Gnome, even if it's the first time in how long since you've gotten with your boyfriend, I think (I think, My Opinion, Not telling you what to do, just MY opinion) you should go to prom, hang with friends, see the youngers all grown up, free food, dance, free food, make fun of old teachers, did I mention free food? BTW, I don't think tickets are refundable...

      LOL!!! I just saw Button-the-Colonial-hippie on TV!!!! for all of you who do not understand this .... which is several of you, I believe ....   - Repeat after me - - - - " it's ... (I don't here an echo yet) .. it's (ah, yes. There it is) ... It's O - K."  ---- good. Very good.  So ANYWAY ... I was watching jimmy kimmel live and they were interviewing people at a post office in Chicago at 11:30pm .. because it is tax day. But anyway - they were going around interviewing people ... The mail people, a couple of slackers, and THEN - they came to this Old dude dressed up like Paul revere!!! And he was Such a hippie! He was standing there and jimmy asked him the obvious question --- "umm, why?" --- and the dude started ranting about how people shouldn't have the pay taxes .. and ya da ya .. Old dude just kept going on. and then jimmy asked him --- "so, have you paid YOUR taxes yet?" --- and old dude was just like -- Sir, that is a personal question -- and started avoiding the camera.... *tries to keep a straight face* ... Personal question --- sure.  I believe that poor old button is one of the stupid few who either tells everyone about their tax evasion through nationwide TV shows ... OR is just a massive hypocrite .. either way --- definitely Button.   anyway .. like i said .. WOW -- Sun.

      Okies, Gnome has encountered a problem. Finally, James has mentioned me and a date in the same setence to his folks. And they're (hopefully) going to accept it, his dad actually expressed interest. But, it's the same night as prom. You see the conundrum. We've been "planning" to ask his dad about this for like 2 months..... Sometime before I knew when prom was, or reasonably close. We didn't realize it was the same night until JUST now. So......  I love you guys. But I don't want to lose the oppurtunity to dress up and go out with my boyfriend, to a dance with dinner, and have his parents approve. So. I still love you all, hanging out all the week before is great since I'm off that week, I'll gladly shop and take part in the prom activities. Maybe I can even come to after-prom if i can get a lift and ya'll can meet me there? ~*~sigh~*~ I love ya'll so much..... but it's something I love....... and.... mew......... Gnomie confused......  Can someone ask Ms. P if a prom ticket can be refunded due to an unchangeable commitment, or a funeral, or make something up? Gotta go, see ya'll later!

      I've r ead the Dragonlance books..... which one did you read/are you reading?  Yay Gnome going to prom!!! Makes people happy. I gave David money for my ticket this morning (Thursday morning). Who all is at the table? And Sometime next week it's "Pick Gnome up from School and take her shopping" day. Preferably sometime I can take my bf cuz he'll be seeing this dress too (potentially). Anywho. Beach house would be great, Limo would ROCK, after prom would  be cool for like an hour, to take pictures of us all doing dumb things, and scoring free candy. Lemme know soon so I can take off work the day after prom or something....... and I still have classes that day...... hmm...... so maybe beach is out for Gnomie. Oh well, we'll talk about it. Anywho, I love ya'll!!!!  So..... bored......  ~*~ cricket ~*~ Don't wanna take quizzes....... wanna go &^*&#^$(*#^$#% with my bf...... but he's busy...... Should be in class........ But i don't feel like listening to an automaton today.  Oh, Andy, how did your project go?   Everyone else, how's the Senior Papers coming???? Anyone done yet? Kendra maybe???  Anyway...... far too bored, gonna go play neopets. See ya'll!!!

      Gnome does want to go.... I know that.... and I don't think any of us actully plan to go to after prom, or at least not for any kinda of period of time, maybe just to grab some free cotton candy and leave hahaha.   ~edit~ although if she don't get money to us for it ometime soon... I guess she won't.....

      Aww Snarky that sux..... feel better  and, omg I just heard some news on tv, some people, of course christian (no offense des.), in texas, well some guy who work in a pharmacy refused to fill a moning after presciption to a rape victim and he lost his job, so he complains worse then Kt, (a very christen thing to do, its in the bible) now they want to write a legistation where you can not lose your job for following your morals (or some shit of that facticmily) cuz that guy was christen and didn't believe in the morning after pill as a good practice. I have some words for him, just for the one in a million chance he reads this.  DO YOUR FUCKING JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!  Does this mean If we work at McD.s and refuse to feed a fatass in texas, I can't be fired, well hell give me a raise and slap my ass ya lil fat child cuz that happy meal is mine!!!!  Stupid Texans......  Any who... so Yay 2 days till spring break!!!!! What   will   we do thsi year? Senior year, really can't be the year we just do nothing, can it??  heres a list of what we can do: beach, day trip Beach, convince tk to convince his parents for like 2-3 days ummm....... any other ideas.. Other SB Goals: Mirror Tks Car, make Robyn Pretty  For prom, Prom Shop....   Also WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR PROM...... Tk said his parents may get Limo... taht would rock.... but after are we going to after prom.... tk said his parents offered the beach house. Is that still in effect, he doesn't act like it?

      ~*~two muscle-bound collared men come forward with a red carpet, rolling it as they go~*~  ~*~they run back behind the curtain, then return carrying Gnome, who is grinning and holding both their leashes~*~  ~*~sigh~*~ It's good to be the pimp..... Anyway.  This is for those of you who still have library books from UD's library. I believe that includes David, Kim, TK, Andy, and Destinie..... They need to be returned by the 28th (THIS FRIDAY) or Gnome will (most likely) be in big trouble. So, I dunno if this will be one mass excursion, or everyone trickling their books back one by one. But I don't care, everyone just needs to get them back. Love you guys, see ya at graduation!!

      Put yourself in this. You get up at your usual time, 6:30. You then realize "there's another dance thingy this morning." Meaning, you really won't be missed or be missing anything. Your plan: stay home and go in at lunch, so you can see Swann and all you really have to do is put up with spanish. Your Mum agrees, not very willing but you tell her your tired *in a whiny voice* and she gives in. As long as you go to school! So, congrates! You can go back to bed. You set your alarm for 10:30 and go back to bed. The outcome: You wake up at 1:30 in the afternoon and curse so loud you wake up your ferret. Bloody heck yo! Found Mum asleep too > *goes off to throw whats left of her alarm clock around*

      Awwww, thanx Kim... I feel loved... but I missed you today :) I wanted my Snarky...   So heres my b-day day round up...  Went to Andys to eat dinner and get Gnome afterwards, but we fell asleep got gnome late and I rushed home like speeeding to get home so my mom could see me befor she left and we could do the whole cake thing... but when I got home 7:30 (I got off work at 6 mind you) she was asleep.. she, like usual, made no special dinner, did nothing special... and has no plans for the night... So I didn care I was 1/2 an hour late.... then she wakes up as me and Gnome get ready for the Evening and call people who don't all answer their phones. lol  and My mom bitchs about how I didn come home and blah blah blah... and 'm like so the fuck what you were alseep, you made ham for dinner (I hate ham, ham also shows she never had a plan for a b-day dinner since it takes all day to cook) and there was no cake... so who the fuck cares If I wans't home, at least Andys family said happy b-day to me.... So me and gnome left to get Tai around 9...   There was an acident on 95......   from 9-10 Gnome and I sat, in one spot, parked, literally parked, car turned off and all, on 95. We decided to play flux and wait it out..... 2 games of flux later, when the line starts moving we packed it away, and drove, well we see my mom pass me in her car on her way to work (she works at 9) and I am like ooo I wana wave.... but we pass her and say "Oh well"   Were going 20 mph now, 5 feet behind the guy in front of us since we were just squinced and the untighening had just begun really, and he slams on his  breaks.. for no reason.. So of course..I slam on mine... but I was too late, Gnome screams "David!!"  and we hear a ::bang::   We pull over, kid gets outa car... hes an afroed stonner, whos like "Aww, man this is my moms car, shiiiiiiiittttt". One word, moron.  I get out, no damage to the cars at all, so I'm like ok whatever lets just go, he wants to call his parents So  say fine and sit on the median in the middle of 95.... My mom passes gives me and gnome the "OMG WTF WHO THE WHHAAAAA GRrrrr i'm gonna eat you" Look.... and drives away.....  we laugh about it, kid comes back outa car 10 mins later, parents didn answer, So i say well lets just exchange #'s and get along with it... we say ok.... I gave him a fake  # and Name and took his... then I pulled off, he was out on his cell so he never in a mile of a year coulda looked at my Plate #, thats a fact, dumb asss Stoners.  We go to Tais, get the mouse, and for the highlight of the evening... WE WENT TO A GAY BAR!!!! It was great, the gayest place we ever saw, played a few games of Pool.... Gnome won 4 or 5 plushies from the cran game machine there haha, AND the lady was willing to sereve us Alchohal, she did'n care.. haha. But Gnome didn let us drink. We had a blast. Then took Tai home, Gnome and I got some McD's and  went to a chuch parking lot by her house.(11 pm) I pissed on said church, a lot, wrote my name, its mine now. I own a chuch. Between me and Mr.Bob thats 2....   Happy b-day to me, and Thank you all for all the b-day wishes and Presents I love you dearly...   P.S. I got home, found an empty ice cream cake box.... they left me the small piece with the H on it... I bet it said go to hell......  A step up from last year, I'll never have a clue to what thet said....  P.P.S.(for Des) I am now an Adult, I can do Adult things, and Go to Adult places, drink adult drinks, and fuck Adult men.   P.P.P.S. Poof Sayas Hi

      Yesh, Bobicus, that's what I said... O_O  Yes, so. Something unimportant... WHY DO THEY MAKE POPCORN JELLY BEANS! First of all, popcorn jellybeans suck. They are the most horrible, artificially flavored thing ever. If I wanted popcorn, I would go and pop a bag and not get myself sick eating a stupid jellybean. I mean, I understand bubble gum jellybeans because they taste good and you can DIGEST them, unlike gum. And I mean, what's the point of gum? I love gum, but you just chew it!! It's really weird.   Gum is a weird concept. Yes it is.

      you people should be online right now! i am hyper and i want to talk. a lot. i have had a very nice day. :) money is nice. more money is better.  and lol. yes sed. i did text message you. :).i expect annoying pointless texts back everyonce in a while. :).  yay. i am happy.  ... and i had a really good cheese danish, and i washed my car, and i ended up getting a little sun, and money is good. this week i have ended up with 60 extra bucks that i didn't think i had. this makes me happy.  and i am drinking tea. it is very good tea. i would say that i am drinking it to help my sniffles feel better... but i am not. it is very good tea. it is caffeine free tea.  o, and sed... that  "THING"  was sooooo unbearably cute that i feel if i ever saw it again i would have to puke. a lot.  GET ONLINE PEOPLE!!!!!!!  i need to be hyper...  and TALK!!!! i'm so hyper i would even consider calling somebody right now, i feel like yacking so bad. but it's late.... not that late.. 11:50.. but late enough.  i need to do jumping jacks or something. maybe play zuma. or go for a jog. or play air hockey... can't do that - my parents would kill me if i woke them up playing some loud game... a great game... but a loud one.  i need a punching bag or something. that would help me release some energy... and it would be slighty quieter than air hockey. slightly.  i repeat... all you people need to get online now.. maybe i'll go for a drive..... omg... soooooooo energetic... i think i'm getting over my allergies.... that would explain the energy boost. but who knows. if only i had this type of energy when i NEEDED it......  if you've read this far... then WOW.... i applaud you. and then i smack you... because you were not online when i was... and 12 oclock on a saturday night...  ewe.. yeuck. i am home at 12 on a saturday night with nothing to do and i am WIDE awake...  but i am still happy anyway, and still extremely hyper.  *POOF* *POOF* *POOOOOOOOOOOOOF!!!!!*

      And how long have these conversations of porn been going on?  I mean..... *cough* even adult destinie is taking part in this conversation... AS A MATTER OF FACT... I think  sed  may have started the whole thing. I am  confused  by this.  and I have a cold. Or a runny nose, or sinuses. Whatever the heck it is.  I have decided that I am going to be one of the most disagreeable old people EVA! Because quite frankly, if I am this bloody disgruntled over a running nose.. Then just imagine the extent of prolong old peopleness - along with all those stupid old people problems.   I think when I get old I am going to live alone in an old messed up house. That way I won't have anyone to yell and if I get bored or really cranky I can just call up a repair to fix something broken and yell at then for wearing plumber pants or what not. And when everything is fixed I'll just go find some other way to yell at people. Maybe I'll be a crossing guard. Or just get a crossing guard vest and stop people during 5 o clock traffic on a busy road. And then make a phone call while I have them stopped there...  I could get one of those big construction worker signs, then I could go on the highway. And if the police found out they wouldn't doing anything because I'd be old people, and police are nice to older people. And if they do take me down to the station I could make a big scene. That would be fun. Better than knitting anyway.

      Yeah, it really sucks. I liked the old Blogger, where you could scroll through everyone's posts if you were replying to something, or ranting at someone else you could be like "and you said RIGHT HERE". I miss it.  ~*~makes big sad face~*~  Anyway. Feeling a bit better, good to hear ya'll are back together David and Andy. IT WAS A DAMN HOUR!!! Anyway. Doing some homework, checking on neopets, writing a paper, listening to Bondage-themed radio (hehe, truly.), and wondering what I'll do for work this summer. Anyone got an idea? Ug, gotta go dentist tomorrow. Sucks.  Talk to ya'll later.

      This new blogged makes me very sad, I even e-mailed the people a rant, telling them they make me sad.... It said this... lol  Title: This Sucks So bad!!!  Mail: The new blogger, well it sucks, blogger was perfect, then google took it over, changed it, and that sucked so bad too, but at least I could still see all of all my posts on one page, even though I had to go through many more pages, now you change it again, and it sucks far worse, it just is crap. Blogger used to be easy, fast and efficent, you ruined it. No Thank you....   Oh btw, did anyone notice last month we reached our 1000th post?

I'm allergic to my ferret, my dogs, my not mine cat, my carnivorous iguana, my bird who somehow still alive, my... I dunno what else but I'm allergic to it! I'm allergic to my english paper. Yeah, that works.  Anyway, servants? ...can they be nekkid stripper servants who have to strip while holding the tray of alcohol? ...wait, they're already nekkid... They'll have to figure how to be nekkid with clothes on! XD  Picture:  urlLink click here   Caption: Connurf: *mumbling* zzz...umn...carnival..zzz..3 tickets to ride...zzz...  *grins like a maniac*  So yeah, I would go work on a gallery but... the pics are on that other computer which my bro is currently on.

      Ya know I relized, when we graduate, well all besides Random, we will leave behind one major charecter (well, object) whose been with us since the start... the table ::sniff sniff:: We need to throw one last great table bash on the last day of school (for seniors).  Or do it on the week after our last day, just come in for one last lunch goodbyee with ghetto cake and fake wine. Also, we must agree to at least once next year all come in one day and sit at (and if need be take back) our table!  And maybe we could think of some way to leave our permanent mark on the table.... any ideas.... put a big old RB paper under it or something carve on it... I dunno..... but our mark must be left!!!

      GNOME IS SICK!!!! YAY!!!!!  Anyway. Gnomie has been feeling like (*^%*&$^(# since Wednesday. So, after a weekend of enforced bedrest (don't think the good kind with cuffs and silk, think mom screaming every time she hears my floorboards creak) and lots of dosing with Sudafed and Ibuprofen, I went to the Wellness Cnter today (yes, they call it that on campus, too). Gnome has swollen gland, might be strep. Joyous! Aren't we glad (in a way) that Gnome did not come to party?? I am! Would've hated to have given all of you strep after passing the herpes. (hehehe..... that just strikes me as funny....)  Anywho. Happy birthday Des!!! Hope your party rocked. BTW, Puerto Ricans buy those Jesus candles too, and they ARE scary! They light them all over my dad's house! It's freakish almost. Yet serene. ~*~sigh~*~ Gnome go bed and dose herself later with Penicillin(sp?). Talk to ya'lls later, we ILL be hanging after I'm done this sick thing. When do classes end for ya'll?

So it's a copy with us in place. (Kim, Destinie, Tai, and David)  2) We look like crap because it's a rip-off and sterotype of Rumiko Takahashi's art!!  3) I'm home tomarrow.

      On an interesting note. I'm reading the "Red Clay Record" newsletter, and in it, it has a bunch of Grad. stuff including Class Pres, Valedictorian, etc. Point of this being, three out of four from A.I. were Cab Students that transfered out. I just thought that was odd. BTW, offical # of Graduates from Cab being 82. Also, four teachers retired from Cab. Bennett, Hiller, LaPoint (Tralka), and Garrett (7th grade Science).

      So, what's everyone doing on Wednesday or Thursday night? Wednesday I know I'm off, my bf's off...... But he wants to be a tard and be home at like 7...... which is stupid. But on Thursday I work until 8, and he can stay out later...... mister "not coordinating his schedule". So anyway, what I'm trying to say: Anyone wanna pick up a Gnome at work at 8 on Thursday, and go to the mall and wander around for like 2 hrs? My bf can catch the bus home from the mall, or get driven home if someone feels like doing that (pretty sure he'll pay gas money, I'll tell him it's expected).   Sigh..... on another note, TK lives!!! Just talked to him online, he is alive!  And on a different note, I'm hungry. So that's that...... time to go eat....

      it's really really hard. the whole entire bottom of it is black. my fault though. when the timer rang i went to go get a plate from the kitchen and ended up staring at the fridge for like 2 minutes. it's 3 am and i'm waiting for the durn(yes.. durn) dryer to finish so i can put the crap in the wash in it. IT'S NOT EVEN MY LAUNDRY! so now i'm just sitting here flipping b/w iron chef and music videos.i hav to be at work at 1 tomorrow and (Oh yay) gotta do more dishes before i go. so i guess i'm looking at like 6-7 hours sleep.(i know, a couple of you wanna smack me -- but i get to go be on my feet for 7 hours at work. and of course just nod my head when some lady comes in and says.....

      Who ever did not attend tonights lil concert thingy going... 2 words..... you suck...  Tonight, in my and Robyns opinions rocked ass..  Most of the bands sucked, we mocked them, and watched star trek, but it was really amuseing after a while. We got free cds, saw Chamile fro our school sing and not suck as bad as one might expect. Then we saw a badn called Simply waiting. They rocked. they grew on us, they played twice, and they dedicated a song to us. Kim, Gnome, Robyn and I. We were very happy hehe. We then bought all their cds and a penguin T-shit they had. THEY LOVED US FOR IT.... we love them. Its works.... We renamed them all too. Pretty, Spiffy Shatner, Barefoot surfer Skitzo, Afro-forgetable, and BeerGut. lol hehe it was fun. Me and robyn are thinking we may ask to book them for a personal concert at a party sometime. Any one game? hehehe...  Me and Robyn wana be their groupies and talk to them on their forums. It'll eb fun, they can be the official Reality Bound Band. We Renamed them Jump Monkey.   After the concert for those who don't know Kim, Robyn and I went to Kims Trailer and had some root-BEER, and snax and talked and reminiced and bitched and ROBYN STOP DRAWING ON THE DESK, we damn near died from laughing.   Robyns mortal combat Move.... left right left up down down down down z x bbbbbbbbb aaaaaaa up: She neals and says "Bless on.." as great special effects make a ball of light apear as she widens her arms..... nothing happens......  Kim and Robyn that rocked that was fun... what was in those drinks and snacks, but I needed tonight whoooooo thiss weekend has rocked.. and in the words of Kim to every guy on the road and to the guys of Simply wating  "SHOW US UR WOODY!!!!!"

      Okay sed, wow, interesting nightmare. I know he's a dork ... but.   NOW, are we doing anything or not? somebody call me tomorrow and let me know. cuz otherwise I may just get dragged to a rather awful party where all they do is play Irish music and bore me out of my skull. ANYONE?!  since we've been talking about dreams I will now let you people be told a slightly shortened version of the freakish little dream thing I had a week or so ago.    Okay, it started with a sort of Armageddon type thing. And for some reason the only thing that was being wiped out was cats and dogs. So at first I was all frantic about my animals and went running home. They were fine, my cat looked like a poorly made Salem(form Sabrina), but they were all fine. I then drive away from my house to go see if all you peoples pets were okay. They were. But when leaving my house, at the corner there was a giant Gas Station price sign.. yeah, whatever. Next thing I know I was at school - with a tray of lobsters(I have no idea). But then I saw David, and David - you decided you wanted the lobsters. So D took the big plastic tray of lobsters -- and ran into the boys bathroom(which was located where the elevator is) and then he came out, and I asked for a ride home, he said yes, but he ran away with the lobsters -- So I was like "screw it"(quote from dream) and I got in my car and drove off. But then I went down a one way the wrong way and realized -- oops -- so I tried to go back, but just kept going down the hill instead. I ended up near my house somehow, and parked on the side of road. I was then like, "oh -- well I should go back and let him know I don't need a ride".  so instead of driving back to school the right way - I decided to climb up the hill through a bunch of bushes. When I was climbing up the hill I came across these rocks, and they were covered in mass quantities and little chiclet's gum of all sorts of colors. It was like a river. And I grabbed a handful of the gum(the orange flavor) and was like "wow, gum, I gotta bring you guys back here." -- and then I woke up.   Now, Honestly. What the eff is THAT? I don't dream very often, but when I do they are MESSED UP. The one before that actually made me dizzy/nauseous -- it was weird.

      *walks in, looks around, scratches head, smiles*   So um, yeah. I had a nightmare two nights ago...   No, not this nightmare.  I mean an actual nightmare. And I don't get those a lot. Well, it was about I started me first day at work (ARG) and then I get to me cash register and I'm standing there and all of the sudden Connor walks up. I proceed to inquire why he is there. He tells me he is no permanently opperating the register next to me. T_T  Well, I guess it's not much of a Nightmare. But... yeah. :S

Yes, I've had a bunch of caffine. Yes, I've...no wait. I haven't. All well. 2 out of 3 ain't bad. Ain't isn't a word! Is to! Dictionary.com says: 1. Contraction of am not.  2. Used also as a contraction for are not, is not, has not, and have not.   Usage Note : Ain't has a long history of controversy. It first appeared in 1778, evolving from an earlier an't, which arose almost a century earlier as a contraction of are not and am not.  >>  ...   *insert overly dramatic POOF! here*

      No they're saying I as in 'Me'...or something. O, wait, All in favor say ___, opposed Nay. I confused.  Guess what? Snarky had an odd dream! We were at the school prom, only we were all in street clothes and the "prom" was in the auditorium/lobby. Oh, and Swann was pregnant. She had one of those white tanks on with you know the quote that says 'baby on board' only it was one of her quotes mixed in. Like 'Don't beam her up Scotty' or something, you know what I mean. Anyway, Bethany apparently got a huge attraction for the 'prom'. A T-Rex. Which they kept in chains in the band pit. They had this picture opportunity for couples where the girl could put on fake chains and sit by the Rex. Ya know like Knight in shining armor saves Princess type of thing. Anyway, we're all standing at the aud. doors while someone, Kelly I think, introduced Bethany to introduce the Rex. Anyway, long story short...umm *looks up at the paragraph she's typed*...-er, Bethany rambles on thanking everyone on the Earth when the Rex breaks out. Of course mass panic and chaos, in which Bethany and a few others get eatened. Funny too, every when in slow mo, like the movies. Anyway, to conclude my rambling essay I have going here: people tried to find a way to kill it. That means taking car doors, etc, and throwing it at the Rex to Jordan and them all. Martin and I went into the electric room, which was were the pool was, and detached some kind of hot-wire in which we were going to throw at the Rex only to get hit by some kind of cold wind-hurricane-thing and end up at the start of the dream again. I hate when I dream about time loops. But of course I didn't know we had already done everything until I woke up. Had a great sense of deja vu the third time through. *in Cho's Mother's voice* Mortal of story: My subconscious is a b*tch.

Cause I can't remember which we were talking about.  And I am so tired that I'm going to add a lil stargate humor:  Sam Carter: Are we all set to record Lt.? Lt. Simmons: Yes ma'am. Daniel Jackson: *whispering to Sam* You know, I'm sensing a little more then obligation there. A crush? Lt. Simmons: um...we're recording now. Sam and Daniel: *look up* Sam: Thank you Lt.

      first of all, you can't  proooove  anything.   secondly, since we aren't very well organized as of yet(or ever) i say that Whatever we happen to be doing that on Saturday, around  -- eh, let's say 1 or 2-ish, we all meet somewhere to do something. if this is the plan,  then i advise someone to contact whoever doesn't read this thing that we want to come.   thirdly, MY CAPTION HAS BEEN ADDED  Seventhly, Snarky, no i will not trade immune systems with you, mine allows me to be a moron at 2 in the morning when i have to work the next day. Also, go to bed.. 6:30 is waaaaaay to early.  *POOF*

BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH (what? I felt it was time for something a little less expected ... Were you expecting to hear the sound of a goat with a very good lung capacity?)  burble?  oh, I got bored so I decided to buy a B-52's CD... Now we don't have to hound the airwaves to hear The Loveshack.. or Rock Lobster.. However the option is still there if we feel like it.  enjoy your gosh awful incredibly boring training. And it makes much more sense that you're not working near me. But I repeat .... I WILL COME BUG YOU.. when I find it. and if I'm near by. maybe. soooo much work just to hunt a sed.   *puts on jungle explorer gear and a starts looking through a pair of giant binoculars* *starts talking in a cross b/w "british-man-voice" and "the croc hunter"*  .... "And as we stealthily trample through these large and rather noisy poisonous bushes, it is apparent that we have still yet to come across a sighting of the illusive (big dramatic pause) TK"....

And Bob, I dunno if you got that comment, but I'll be working in Newark. X3 Call me for stuff, I might not be online much since I have 4 hours training sitting at a computer for the next three days.

      Hope you did well on your ori...thingy. I'm to lazy to see how it's spelled.   In other news, Leanna's grad party: who honestly wants to go? Oh and I've been out of it all weekend cause of a fever so yeah. fun. just letting anyone know why I haven't done anything.  On to important stuff.  Bobicus  had the idea of going bowling. Or rather go bowling with a twist: we wear our Prom gowns. And as she said, who's really going to wear them again?  Gnome  also came up with an idea. Since none of us were able to make it to David's Grad party for reasons beyond our control, she suggested we have a Reality Bound Graduation Party-Picnic.  In our prom gowns! ignore me, i'm annoyed cause pop-ups keep poping up for no good reason  Both ideas, I agree with so, as Bob said, She has off Wed, Fri, and Sat. Anyone one else have off and if so what do you want to do? Also, for the Grad-Party-Picnic-Thing: Im thinking maybe next Wed? It's going to rain this Tues, Wed, Fri, and Sat, but next week looks nice. Questions, Comments, Flames, etc?  BTW, has anyone heard from Mr. Cranky (TK) lately?

      Okie, the thing about Herpes was a little creepy, but my house is only stocked with coke right now! X3   Snarky, the comic is cute, and the anime SORTA has a plot, except they have Rena and Shugo in some sort of incest situation or something. Really odd. I'd like to read Fruit Baskets, but I never picked up the anime 1) because I basically never buy it unless I know I'm going to watch it more than once 2) the art looked a little lame. X3  I have an interview at Shoprite at 1:30 today. That's in 2 hours! >.  And You should all go read  urlLink my DA journal entry  because some D&D people totally stole my poor Elucidor.

      Heres a few fun facts and an intresting story... well 1 fun fact and an intresting story I heard....   First, My Dad told me, its on the news, that oddly a hell of a lot of Pakasatanian and other middle eastern people are leaveing the country schedualed for late june.... and its becomeing too many of them to be a coincidence... so thats odd.... ya know ... makes one go...hmmmmm. They each have their own reasons of course like, family problems and the such.  Well... heres the story scoop...  My Dad also told me he talked to a guy he wroked with tonight.. A close friend..   And The Guy said his sister who lives in maryland, was at a grocery store a few days ago, and she was behind a pakastanian woman, who was actaully shopping to get ready to leave the country....   and.. the lady was like 3 or 4$ short on money for her order... and to move along the line his sister gave her the money she needed, ya know, being nice.... and the lady walked away took her things and left.... never said thank you... nothing. His sister chalcked it up to that being the rude world of today.  well....   when she, his sis, got to the parking lot.. she got a tap on her shoulder... and she truned to find the woman from the line... and she says to her... "Don't drink any pepsi products this summer"... and walked away... and they found it odd....at first she thought, oh, well, why would the Arabs boycott pepsi??...and then was like...hmmmm and now it seems it might have been a thank you warning...     Now, especially Tk.... who has not drank a papsi product at some point this week...  If that was the plan, and that could be a damn good one, and not a mission impossible, how many americans will die with in a week?   Hmm... should we change the name of herpes to anthrax?

      Gnome's in a happy mood. No good reason, just in a happy mood. Missing her gang, since I haven't seen anoyne except TK and David since Tuesday, and some of you even before that! And what's all this Love Shack nonsense?  Oh, but the real reason I posted. Clickage!!  http://www.lifetimetv.com/health/breast_mastectomy_pledge.html   This is about a bill/petition that needs signatures. It makes a mandatory 48-hour stay for women undergoing a mastectomy. Generally, women have to leave the hospital with tubes still sticking out of them, still groggy, and still in pain, b/c insurances don't cover mastectomies.  Both of my grannies died from cancer, my mommy had a cancer scare about 6 months ago, and your friendly Gnome is  HIGHLY  likely to get some type of cancer during her lifetime, considering the lovely health of my grandparents and parents. So, go sign the petition. All ya need is your name and zip code, nothing else is mandatory.   In other news, it's a year for me and James in 5 days!!! Go me!!! Anyone feel like giving me a ride to the mall on Monday so I can hang out with my boy for our anniversary? I can take the bus anyway...... But yeah. I'll shut up now. Go sign the petition!!!!

      and we have disowned the dj of the female gender because she took too long. you'd think people would try harder to be a god.. oy.  i might wanna go to sixflags, depends on the cash flow. how soon do you need to know? and will there be jesus singers again?... not that that would have any influence on my going - i'm just poor.   *cries* i can't get sound on this computer.  we should plan another outing for sometime in the future..... something cheap { $$$$ = :( }. like a picnic or something...  HAPPY MONDAY!!! -- hope everyones sunburn is improving... my leg still has that stinging tingly feeling *stares at leg -- shakes head*

Both Robyn and Assia have been before (I will have to ask Asi if she wants to go again). Yeah, we usually have to be at the church by 8am. If no one wants to go, that's okay.

      well. why did the first couple of pages of blog look all funny and table-ish.. i was getting to like the new blog look. and also... that's kinda creepy that people are watching us(hi jill and whoever else). this goes against my "can not trust any one on line besides the people i already know" policy. i don't know which urge is stronger.. the urge to be paranoid and stop writing..or the urge to be lazy.... lazy won. o well.    happy thursday. no idea why.  i wanna see a movie this weekend. or do something. i am bored.

      Alight Tk, i'll give ya the benifit of the doubt. It was a bad weekend to go to the beach any way, but this means you MUST come on tuesday to Six Flags. just make sure you keep us posted on ANY more opertunitys for a weekend at the beach... cuz I'd need to know ahead of time and we'll see how the summer goes.   Any way, so for the siz flags trip Here we go  People going: Me, Bob, Snarky, Tk, Gnome, .... has anyone invited Tegan or Tai or Des??? is not TOMMAROW I NEED ANSWERS (as in monday)  Cost per-person, this is pending but a flat fee of 30$$ Due to Fee of getting in and gas money for whom ever drives (looking like me) Still better then the 50 or so of regular admission.   Driveing: I said I would, any better ideas, bring them up to THE GROUP tommarow. If all kinks and ideas are not worked out by midnight on monday this trip is cancled as far as I'm concerened, I say so lol.   Last I say we leave early in the morn, but not tooo early, say being on the road by 10, meaning leaving the last house around 9:30! Yes, you may have to get up at 8, boo hoo welcome to my summer (working every day full time)  So if that is all and I believe it is. I leave you ....  Oh! btw solution to uneven problem... Gnome may not eb able to go any way, and also I have a coupon that makes it 28$

      You're all still welcome to come down if you can find a ride. But I posted as soon as I found out we were still going and the entire reason I posted was because I knew I would forget by graduation, I had a lot on my mind and I've always had a bad short-term memory. I'd still love to have anyone come down who wants to but wasn't given much time to organize it well.  BTW... Kim, I really do hope that your post wasn't a responce to my e-mail...

      Okay, first i would like to say that We have finally graduated and are now, as kim said, "not highschoolers" ... yay!    Congradulations to Everyone!!!   Now, about six flags.  first of all... we really need to plan things out a little more .. it is this tuesday.  Money - tickets are 46 bucks a pop, plus 6% sales tax. YES, there is sales tax. :( that means that if we use the coke cans to split the price it comes to $24.38 each. we can use the half price thing on up to twelve people cause i've got six cans...  Also, it would be nice if we kept the people at an even number or else things are gonna get really screwy money wise.. plus, it's better for rides that way.  WE NEED TO KNOW WHO IS GOING!!! MAKE A LIST!!! SOMETHING!!!  also, we have no time set, no idea of who is going in what car or anything to that nature... or we do - and i just don't know about it... possible -- but not the case(better not be anyway) -  SEE YOU ALL ON TUESDAY I'm also emailing this to everyone for those who don't get to go to blog very often.

      I side with Snarky here Tk, that was fucked up.  If you really wanted to make us seem welcome you would have said something at graduation. Or just kicked us in the ass. Sometimes I wonder about you any more.... but ah well, I'd rather have not gone and been told indirectly I'm not wanted then have gone and not knowen.   *add some sarcastic thing here*  Have fun with your plans this weekend everyone!!!!! Even Tk at the beach... don't sit too much....

You knew no one would read Blogger right before Grad. If you didn't want anyone to go with you, just say so instead of making excuses.  I'm off to bed, then to da race. See you all on Tuesday!

      Okay, I know it's been a while since my last post but I'm only here to leave a quick message. I don't know how many of you are going to read the blog before graduation but here it is: I have found out that my dad and I are actually still going to the beach this weekend, we'll be going either tonight or tommorow morning (most likely tonight) and will be returning on momday some time around noon. if you want to come just send me an e-mail or call me or something along those lines, I'll be at my house until a little after five-thirty or you can talk to me at graduation. Well, that's all. Oh, except for one thing: congratulations all!

      Me, Kim and Possibly Robyn are planing a trip for us to six flags for tuesday, you may already know or you may be obliviouse ::shrugs:: But there ya go. Regular admission costs like 45$, were useing coke cans get one person in freee things to split the price for everyone, to like 22.50, but for whoever drives (so far prolly me) its a long ride, so we need to put in gas money cuz we all poor. So expect the trip to cost teh flat free to around 30$ So go, ask your parents, do what ya gotta do, we'll be on your door step tuesday morn like it or not.....  Its good to know all our books are in, yay, ::crings and waits for the fine to fall::

      So there! Just because I spend the night at my boyfriend's house does not make me a skank or something!! His parents were home, he slept downstairs (I got to sleep in his bed ;-) ), and nothing happened..... much to Gnomie's disappointment. But it's all good! I am now the proud owner of a '04 Delaware fishing liscense.... yay...? And I learned how to fish without getting the line and bobber stuck in a tree. And I caught a fish!  Anyway, David's taking me out job-hunting tonight. Yay! Anyone know anything close to Kirkwood Highway that's hiring? Preferably cashier/register, retail something, or food service. I can't do anything else. Oh, and daycare. Gnome loves the kiddies! Thanks for returning your books, gonna check and see if any are still out...   ~*~checking~*~  Ok, something called "Vaudeville Pioneer" is still checked out, but has been renewed for July 1st. Andy, I believe that one is all you. Thanks you guys!! Dunno if I'm fined for anything yet, but I'll check later.

      hm. i thought you had some sort of AIM or something. o well. whatever.   lol.. that dream is very interesting sed.. i think we should definately find out what the pyshic lady looks like... that would be so weird if it really looked like her.   And yeah,&nbsp;kim definately got the note... it's mentioned a couple of times a few posts back.   and i have found a new band that i like bunches... but am too lazy ---- and broke --- to buy their CD.  Modest Mouse.   yeah, i know -- here's comes a bunch of "Mouse" references, but that's their name.&nbsp;  it's a shame. cuz there's a couple Cd's i wanna buy.. but the money saved for more important things, so i can't complain. --- if i still haven't gotten them by Xmas or my bday.. keep that in mind.. i'll make a list..   and whoever changed the time thingy *cough*twas it sed?*cough*&nbsp;that's&nbsp;a great one. lol.

      Bah, no one's on Superstar anymore. The site just died. Doesn't matter. T_T Poor site.   My heels hurt.   BOBICUS! I had a weird dream last night that the psychic I left the note at had visited me and started crying about how it was mean to make fun of her and leave a note at her door. Here's what she looked like: Middle sized, Long dark-blonde hair, black shirt. It was REALLY weird. X3   I like Leaving notes. Did Snarky get mine? >_>   *Puts on a black boa and dances around*

      ooooooooooooh, that's what was on the reciept. i forgot to look - and is there something wrong with Orange Tic Tac's? :P &nbsp; and no, you probably don't want to ask about Sparkles, but if you must.. i was just bored. &nbsp; and&nbsp;now for&nbsp; a quote i happened to come across the other day. &nbsp;  The fastest way to a man's heart is by tearing a hole through his ribcage.  &nbsp; actually, that isn't the one i intended to put sooooo, HERE'S MORE!!! &nbsp;  &nbsp;It's always darkest before dawn.

      When did you guys go play mini-golf?? I wanna go play mini-golf...... I'm so confused...... I always get confused..... And who took the picture? ~*~sigh~*~ Well anyway..... life is sucky right now, missing my bf, missing my gang, having to work crappy hours....... We're growing apart!! We're all losing each other!! Especially since I don't have a car! Car would be good, considering everyone younger than me has one. Blah.  &nbsp; Anyway, I'm bored. Called Andy's cell phone at like 1:30, and he didn't answer, called his house and they weren't there..... So onwards&nbsp;to calling David's house. Or, I'll just go vegg in my room and waste away. That's a good plan too.&nbsp; ~*~sigh~*~ &nbsp; Sorry I didn't get here to post a caption. I've been busy trying to find a job, finally got one at Sears. Yay. &nbsp; Anyway...... Gonna sign off now. No point in being online, since there's no one here. Buh byes.

      So, I'm home today. Last night was intresting. Me Andy Gnome Bob and T. Played VCR Clue. Was very very annoyingly hard!!!!! OMG!!!! Who ever made clue become that involved should be shot. We must all play one day :) hehe  So I'm doing nada, working on my camera and shit. Chillin. Missing my Andy, but I'll prolly see him tommarow  Can Can Sale... oh, that sucks Des. but how hard can it be. Just a million old woman who think can goods are a good idea incase of disaster. At least its not the can cna sale right after like 911 or something, cuz then you know it was crazy.  Ha! Bob has to work tommarow... I have off... ::likes being off:: yesterday was hard... lol I baisicly ran the studio cuz everyone was on Vaca, all that was there was me and Steph. I was like WTH and she was like "Oh, their on vaca. Someone planned this badly." and I had 60 seniors to shoot. ::dies:: so that was hard. lol  Kim you wanted to know my schedual this week.  Well tommarow I move all the shit to Mt Pleasant and shoot there for the week so I think I'm there through friday. So it prolly gonna be something like this. Tues-8-5 Wens-8-5 Thus-8-5 fri-8-6:30 sat-9-5 (in studio day, lunch at Twelve... Andy..)  So call me when ever or E-mail me a day befor that you wana go out on a day and I'll get back to ya, prolly around 5 or 5:30 of that day lol. Any way I have things to go do, places to roam in, and people to eat.  ttyl  HAVE FUN IN POCONOS KIM, and if Tk ever read this GET YOUR ASS BACK AND STAY HERE   OOOOOOOOO wait stop the press... I forgot...  Ok, So I came so close to tracking down Tai the other day. My mom said she saw her working at sears the other day and it was only an hour befor I got home. So I was like omg, and called sears and was like line hopping between departments searching her out, ready to yell at her. and Finally someone told me shes in Tools and Transfered me up there, and I was getting ready to hear her lil Voice and say "WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN" off the bat. But a guy answered, I asked for Tai, he said she left 5 mins ago..... Mission:Failed!

      umm. i don't feel like getting out of my pj's today. i think i'm doing well as far as that. Hope you enjoyed the pocono's kim. Can-Can sale.... i'm guessing that's work related --- well, maybe your arms will get nice and strong from lifting all those cans.  i have to work tomorrow.. i don't really feel like going to work... i'll be glad when i start something else. uck - soooo boring. i got my car fix. turns out i managed to break the... uh... catallitic converter... yeah. that's sounds right. that's really expensive to replace, i think, but we know the mechanic guy, so he just welded it back together.. and i gave him Arby's. All better. Quiet is a wonderful thing. I think that that's all that i have that's remotely important, so i'm gonna go now.  * a pitiful little poof* * now a really big poof with sparkles* * and i'm gone*

      d, that's gross.  anyhoo, ola people. I'm just killing time. I have to work in.... 10 hours and 44 minutes.  umm... Okay I give up, here's some lame little caption for the contest.   "Yay! This rock looks like Africa!! ... Ms. Swann would be proud."   also, you can count these as captions if you want ... I'm just pointing stuff out now.   Has anyone noticed that Kim happens to look like Buddha with a golf club in this photo.    Who gave us weaponry anyway?   I'm now starting to make up words to the tune of "The 12 days of Christmas" so I'll stop now - before you all end of with twelve verses of "oh wow, kill me now." YOU HAVE BEEN SPARED!!!

      if your that bord, Kim and Robyn or anyone else. If ya wana do something, or talk to me, or shift together a get together, is call me. We all know i'm usually up for something, even if I'm doing something already and I usually am, its ok to see. The phone seems the most effective and least used means up comunication here. Any way so u all have My house, andys house and Andys cell numbers so.... there ya go  I'll see if I can make that Chat room thing tommarow kim, but I dunno if I'll be doing anything or not, at 7 on my day off I'd rather not be sitting on the comp. wasteing time. I'm way to busy and its my biggest energy day.  Moveing on, tommarow, if anyone, wants to go see fire works or do anything with me tommaorw. I'm free all day on the 4th cuz Andys going to his Aunts and I haven't time to plan anything with anyone else thus far. So give me a call, I know u have my house #, 475-4080. If that dunn work, mail me and I;ll call u when I get it, but then don't just walk away. We've proven, you just can't plan things through e-mails and writeing.  Verbal Communication, its what most prefer. Especially those with lil time to read messages everyday...

      I don't know what else to say about that picture other then...THE EYES! At least they don't look all innocent. *shivers* da eyes... Did you color the love shack one? I told Bob about it and I want her to see ^^ Now go! Finish Vadnir! ...so you have time to work on RB ^^  Random Historical Info! In England there were two categories a crime could be; felony or misdemeanors. If the crime was a misdemeanors, the person was sent on a one way trip to either Georgia (da state) or (after the Rev. War) Australia. If the crime was a felony, the punishment was hanging. Now for the good part: If a cop caught you trying to commit suicide, you would be taken to the court which finds suicide a felony and you would be hanged. - -; Just let him kill himself and save the trouble! I don't know why but that amuses me.  Oh, BTW. TK went to the beach again. He'll be back Friday.
