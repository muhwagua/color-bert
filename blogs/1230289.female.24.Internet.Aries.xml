       Fever...Not good... :(   Today is suppose to be RPG Saturdays for me.  Every Saturday, I go out and meet some friends of mine in Makati and play RPG...not the computer games but the "Dungeons and Dragons" kind.  For those who doesn't know what I'm talking about, RPG or Role Playing Game is not the computer game that kids today know.  It's a kind of role playing game where you and your friends sit down with a rule book, some d10 (ten sided dice), a character sheet, pencils and erasers and a game master (or story tellers) calling the shots of a particular adventure you will be having for that day.  It's really a game where you play a character, might like your real self or you play a different personality and act it by means of description.  Sometimes you get to act it out too.  The best thing about RPGs is that you get to go places no one can go.  You get to experience meeting the strangest people while in reality you're just sitting down with friends.  You get to do things you won't naturally be doing in real life.  You get to experience love, hate, pain, anger, happy, sad and excited in a span of four hours (that's how long our game usually takes).  It's a game where people with no imagination whatsoever would never understand...I tried explaining this to some old friends of mine and I swear I could see questionmarks above their heads.  I think they were thinking that I'm an alien or something. :D  Anyway, that's what I love about RPG.  I tried playing those computer RPGs but it's really different.  Computer RPGs tend to give you only two choices, sometimes three, sometimes none at all.  But with the real RPG, you get to choose most of the time.  You get to describe it and you get to act it and it's your head that's going to suffer if you made the wrong choice.  I was reminded about a game last week that was really funny.  We were playing Mage:Sorceror's Cruisade, and Jay, our GM (game master) was suppose to give us a serious game...unfortunately it turned out to be one of those funny moments.  I guess it was because it was in the renaissance era and we're just trying to feel our way in the game.  Anyway, one of the players was a sailor who can talk to sea creatures.  But that's not the funny part.  But to give you the gist, our group entered a sailing competition.  We made some changes in the boat like adding fins that resembles the legs of a tortoise (imagine how the tortoise move underwater and imagine cargo boat doing the same movement) and a canon that was attached to the back of the ship in case we need an extra boost but we will use it only during emergencies.  Needless to say, we tried the tortoise fins but we have yet to test the canon.  Anyway, moving on. The player who was the sailor who can talk to sea creatures in the game had a misunderstanding with our GM.  We were made to get ready within the week and everyone who joined the contest (imaginary competitors of course) will sail on the same day.  Our friend didn't understand it I guess because he planned on sabotaging the other boat (the military boat).    Needless to say, he got himself in trouble by killing innocent people because of the sabotage and ended up getting killed himself in the process.  Good thing our GM was kind enough that he gave that player a second chance and that player ended up dreaming that he died because he was planning on sabotaging the other boats.  Anyway, my point here is you can't do that on a computer RPG.  It's all fixed for you.  You know what will happened to you already if you did this thing or that.  In RPG, you have more than one choice and if you GM is that good like my friend Jay or my older brother for that matter, you are always at your feet because you don't know what you're up against.  Clearly, the human mind is still superior to the computers.  You're always have to double guess what would happened next.  It's ashame I have a fever today.  I would really love to have played today.  I really look forward to RPG Saturdays.  Being sick isn't a good thing.  You always get to stay at home, mope, read a book, mope, watch TV, mope, eat, mope, sleep, mope...  Getting sick really sucks.  I have been a sickly child since way back and it really bugs me that among me and my siblings, I get to be the sick one.  I have healthy brothers and sister and it's really hard to catch up with them.  You see all of them into sports while you have to watch in the background cheering them on.  Hence the reason I love RPG.  I get to be a healthy person in RPGs.  I get to jump, run, kick ass without breaking a sweat with my clothes still on the right places and a dashing debonaire smile after a finish the stunt. :D  I hope I get better soon.  I want to go back to my world of "healthiness".  Not this headache-cold-and-fever-with-a-minor-heart-attack-on-the-side kind of world that I am right now...And I would really like to find out what will happened to our tortoise moving boat.  Maybe we could even get to use the canon when we're nearing the finish line.

       Sayings and then some...    "I already have a sword, not one made of metal.  The sword is inside me.  It is not a very good weapon right now.  It needs to be hammered into shape." - Raistlin at age 6. "Soulforge"    This is one of my favorite phrases in the Drangonlance Book "Soulforge: the Raistlin Chronicles".  As I remember correctly, this is the time when Caramon was convincing Raistlin to practice sword fighting with him for his own protection but Raistlin said no.  Raistlin was right though.  All of us has a sword that needs to be hammered into shape before it could be a very good sword.  It needs to be carefully crafted.  If we hurry in shaping our swords, it could never be a good weapon.  It would break easily when battle arises and we would be left with nothing to defend ourselves.  To shape our swords needs time and patience.  We should rush it because it will not be of any use if we did.  It needs to be molded carefully so that it would be the kind of shape that we want our swords to be.  It needs to be handled with care so that we won't hurt anybody with it.  We mustn't be careless with it because it's a powerful weapon.  We have different kinds of swords that needs shaping and wielding.  It is up to us to see to it that we mold it and handle to either help other people or use for our own gain.

       Changes...   As you can see, there have been alot lately for the passed few hour in this blog.  I changed the the way it looked like and even changed the site. From www.tonnie_seawolf.blogspot.com, it became www.kirsikka.blogspot.com.  I'm just trying to get the feel of this blog and trying to change things according to my preferences.  As my friends already know, blue is my favorite color.  So I have to find a suitable template that has a shade of blue. :D  It's simpler now and I actually like it...except that the text box is narrow...it sorta represents me, so thin but has so much on her mind. :D  Anyway, I like the look very much...but you may guess that in time, it may change again. But at the moment, I'm liking it very much.

       Drinks Anyone?       What Drink Are You?    This is one of those afternoon that I just don't want to work anymore.  I just want to go home and read a book or sleep (sleep...a luxury for me at the moment).  Anyway, I went to my friend's blog and took this test.  Contrary to my previous rant about internet quizes and test are a load of crap, this quite funny.  The test suits my just fine, hot chocolate is my favorite drink after all.  I guess, my friends see me as this as well (i hope).  You know, I never actually guess that hot chocolate conotes this kind of characteristic... Maybe it's because hot chocolate are warm and has a very pleasant aroma...much like coffee. :D  When you drink chocolate, you have that sense of satisfaction.  I guess that's the reason why the test said that it feels like home. :D  Try the test yourselves and see what kind of drink you are as well. :D

       Something to think about...  Good morning! This is a very hectic day for me... We are getting ready for another seminar workshop about solid waste management.  I have so many things on my mind right now.  But one thing that actually stuck to my head is the fact that here in our country, we have to make training workshop to teach people the proper segregation of garbage.  It's suppose to be fairly easy.  I just don't understand why some people have to be hard headed on not following these simple process of segregating garbage. Most of them say that it's tedious.  More work for them if they start segregating garbage when there are garbage men collecting these waste.  Other reasons were the cost.   They say that if they start segregating their waste, it would cost them more. I say that's a load of crap.  It doesn't cost so much at all.  And tedious as it may be, think of the good it will do.  Garbage segregation minimizes the waste that goes to dumpsites, lessening another smokey mountain and Payatas incident.  Garbage segregation means business for people with no work.  Some garbage can be recycled and made into something else.  Newpapers can be made into baskets, doy packs (zesto packages) can be made into bags and slippers (and foreigners love these things that they actually pay big money to have it exported), magazines can be made into necklaces, pentelpens changed into ballpens...see the possibilities are endless! I believe that we Filipinos are a very creative group.  We just don't use our heads in the proper way.  Instead of using our heads to better our already dying country, we use our heads to help in killing it. A little reminiscing for a moment... Back in college, I was a member of an environmental friendly organization called HABITAT (it's different from HABITAT for humanities).  Anyway, that organization got me to be aware of what has been happening to our country's environment.  People just throw garbage anywhere! On the streets, beaches, forests, and places where you shouldn't be throwing them.  Unfortunately for me, the organization died in my hands. All my officers abandon me save for one person whom I am so greatful for. It was really a pity that HABITAT died.  There weren't anymore people who would like to be members of it.  Most people are not aware of what has been happening in our environment.  They would rather look the other way when you try to point it out to them.  It's really sad to think that we help in destroying mother nature and we just pretend nothing is happening. I'm so afraid what will happened in the future if we don't fix this problem now.  What would happened to the next generation?  Wouldn't we want our children to grow up healthy?  Wouldn't we want to let them experience free drinking water from the faucet instead of the bottled water that cost P10 - P20 for 50ml that we are so used to now?  Wouldn't we want our children go biking in the neighborhood and not worry about the air that they breathe? We really need to think about what we are doing to the environment.  If not for ourselves then for the future.  I myself do not want these things to happened.  I do not want my future children to live on a grey planet. There is still a chance for us to change.  There is still a chance to save our environment.  We just have to stop complaining and start caring...If not for ourselves, then let's do this for our children. As the song goes, "You can own the earth and still all you own is earth until you can paint with all the colors of the wind." We do not own the earth, we just borrowed it from our children.

       EVA?       Which Evangelion Child Are You?    Have you ever watched Evangelion?  It's that weird Anime that literally ends up killing everyone on the planet except for two people (or so that's how I interpreted it).  Anyway, this character Rei.  She's such a silent child.  But even with the numerous times she was attacked and almost shot to death and practically died already, she's always there on the next episode.  Freaky ain't it?  At some future series you will eventually find out the secret of her always miraculous recoveries....but you have to send me an email for that since I don't want to spoil it to those people who haven't watch it but wants to.  Anyway, Rei is the kind of person who gets the job done no matter what happens.  But she's the kind of person who does it while following the rules of the game but still ends up winning.  How many of us tend to bend the rules jus to get what we want?  How many times do we have to lie to get the job done or just give some leeway to finish the job?  I guess we all need to find the Rei inside all of us.  If we actually want to be a better person or a better citizen of this dying country, we have to find a way to be like Rei.  We need to stop blaming each other and see actually start helping one another to help bring this country back to life.  Like Rei, we have to start everyday like we're a newborn.  We should start seeing things in a different perspective.  Evangelion maybe a weird series but it tends to give lessons about life in general in such a manner that you won't see until you reflect on it.  Maybe we could even find a way to use this Anime series to better our already corrupted and dying country. :D

       Reminicing the awful past...   Today is a time for reminicing for me.  My boyfriend is in Alominos today for a hearing.  He had a vehicular accident a few months ago.  He was with his two cousins that time.  He was driving a pick-up truck from Bicol to Manila when they were side-swiped by a bus going on the same direction.  He was hospitalized because of a fractured bone on his leg and some stitchings were need near his head and ear.  He survived but his two cousins didn't.  I'm pretty close to those two cousins of his, especially the other one, Dennis.  He makes me laugh and genuinely cares about my well being.  He's a good singer and guitar player. And he always has a smile on his face even when you know that he has a problem or just sad about something.  I really miss him very much.  It was really a shock to me when they told me that he's dead.  Flashes of images and memories went through my mind screaming at me.  I wouldn't see him anymore.  I would never hear his voice when he laughs or sing with his guitar strumming along the way.  I wouldn't be cheering for him anymore when basketball season starts again.  I wouldn't hear his jokes.  I wouldn't see his smile.  He would only be a memory to me from now on.  A fond memory that will not be erased from my mind, ever.  A memory that will be etched in my heart for all eternity.  It was harder for my boyfriend...when he was in the hospital we've talked about it and he seems to be blaming himself on the accident.  Everyone from his family and friends tries to tell him that it wasn't his fault but I don't think he believes them and me.  Frankly speaking, it must be really hard for him.  He was the only survivor after all.  I couldn't imagine what he could be thinking all these months of blaming himself and playing the what if questions.  The most painful part for me is that he wouldn't let me in his little world.  He keeps it to himself and tries not to pester people about it.  That's where I know that he's wrong.  You can't move on if you cling to the past and blaming yourself for the accident will make it harder if not impossible.  There are some days that I feel so helpless.  I guess this is one of those awful days.  For me, it's really painful to just stand in the sidelines while the love of your life is struggling with his inner demons.  But what can I do?  I can't force him to tell me...it would make him resent me more if I do that.  I have to wait until he opens up to me. And for me, that's the hardest thing to do.  Just stand in the background waiting for the right moment to enter on cue.  For now, I'm just here waiting to be called.

       First time for everything...   This is the first time I will be doing this.  Writing something for the public to read I mean.  This is just one way of showing to the world that I can write and I don't care what those test tell me.  Just to give you a gist on that, I went to a friend's blog and took a test that was posted there.  It's "what kind of writer are you?".  So, out of curiosity, I took the test.  Whoa and behold, result showed that "I am not a writer".  It really did made me upset that time.  All my life, friends appreciate the things I write.  They say I'm actually a fair writer.  Test like those really sting when all your life, you know that it's that one talent you can be proud of.  I don't just write for the hell of it...though sometimes I do.  But most of the time, I write because it helps me with my life.  I just don't write because I'm bored and I have nothing to do.  Writing for me is a way I can express my feelings to the people around me.  Friends will know that I'm not actually a very talkative person most of the time.  The only time I actually get to really talk is when I'm upset, really happy or crying my heart out when I have problem.  Sometimes, I don't even do that.  I just keep it to myself (and people say that that's a bad thing to do).  So, I write. I write to vent off all the emotions that's crammed inside this little body of mine. I write to show people the real meaning of life.  I write to show them that this "little girl" can be expressive like the next person. But how I actually show them is through my writings.  Writing also helps me clear my mind.  With all the data stored there, there isn't room anymore for new ones.  Hence, writing it down for future use.  Writing keeps me sane.  With all the pressure of work that I have right now, plus the bitchie high school friends that I have that still come to me and tell me that I'm a worthless human being, and those internet quizes and test that also tells you that you're one talent is nowhere to be found in your psyche, writing actually helps me to keep a smile on my face at the end of the day, like a had done yesterday and the day before that.  So, the lesson for today: "Don't listen to internet quizes and test that tells you you're not cut out for this.  You might end up writing a blog like me." :D

       PANIC ATTACK!!!   So far, I have been staring at different kinds of budget of SWARMPlan (Stands for Solid Waste Reduction Master Plan).  Frankly speaking...I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH IT!!!!  My boss told me that I need to analyze it and get it ready for re-alignment (whatever that means).  Math has always been my weakness in school and it's haunting me now that I'm working.  Physics? Trigonometry?  I understood those things.  They were easy enough to understand. Statistics? Well, I did pretty well as well.  But when it came to accounting, book keeping, algebra and all those other math subjects, I am at my wits-end.  Since this morning, I have been looking over these things and I it's already 4:30 pm in my watch and still I have no conclusion as to what I need to do to get the give a realignment report.  I'm honestly having a panic attack.  I don't know what to do with the work that I'm suppose to be doing now.  It's really killing me to just stare at these papers and question marks forming at the back of my head like I'm trying to read a different language (Probably Chinese or Japanese).  My head is spinning and it doesn't help that I still have a fever.  What am I to do?  I already asked for help but I still don't know what to do?  When it came to this kind of math problem, I really suck big time.  I have been going over paper after paper, still I don't know how to compute this.  At the moment, I'm just going to lay back and let my mind wander.  There must be something here at the back of my head, under the deep crevaces of my brain, that would help me solve this problem.  It might just pop into my head when I least expect it.  But in the meantime, I wait in panic...

       Someone I miss...     Death, the second of The Endless, you are responsible for ending all lives and taking them to your realm, from which no one ever returns. You are bright, positive, happy, optimistic and enjoy everything about life, but that does not mean your silly or stupid. You can lay the smack down when you have to! Everyone loves you, and they don't know why.    urlLink   Which Endless are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    This test reminded me so much of my character Tonnie Seawolf (the masochist teenager who doesn't know how to use a gun).  Tonnie is the epitomy of Death.  Being a Dreamspeaker, a mage that has the 6th sense ("I can see dead people"), she can talk, touch and bribe souls that are trapped in the spirit world.  She can talk to spirits who just recently died and tell them where to go to reach paradise.  She can also ask help from spirits who have special talents and skills and merge with them.  Her favorite spirit buddy is Bruce Lee.  She calls upon him and ask him to join her while she fights bad people.  So if you see her, she would be acting like Bruce Lee while she fights.  Her favorite weapon is a knife that was given to her by her grandfather on her 16th birthday, which was also the same day she found out that she was a mage.  She is very skillful with the knife.  She can throw it with great accuracy, use if to defend herself even if her opponent is using a long sword and use it to attack you by lashing at you.  And frankly, she never misses.  But for a masochist, she doesn't know how to use a gun.  She had tried to use a shotgun in several occasions only to end up using it as bat or staff.  She always seemed to miss even at point blank range.  She's a masochist by nature.  Everyone wonders why she enjoys pain.  She loves to get hurt and enjoys every little kind of hurt that may come upon her.  There was one incident that the group had a mission to get a particular package in enemy lines.  Tonnie was already surrounded but she was still fending off her opponents.  She was already crippled and was using the shot gun as a crutch but she still kept going until one of her friends found her and teleported her back to their base. She was really pissed off that time because even though she tried to block the magic her friend was doing, she still ended up back in the chantry when she could still be helpful in fendinf off the technocrats even in her state.  She has a soft spot for Ann, the ghost-girl that Dr. Alex Stevens have as a companion of sorts.  She looks like she was around seven years old.  She was very special to Tonnie.  Tonnie even called upon a dog named "Lassie" just so that Ann won't be lonely being the only spirit in the group.  And losing that little girl was the most painful thing Tonnie has experience, even more painful than the death of both her parents and grandparents.  The little ghost-girl sacrificed herself so that the group could enter the gauntlet unscathe.  Ann kept haunting her dreams even when she got married and had a son already.  But Ann returned to be an Avatar of another mage of the new generation.  I love my Tonnie Seawolf character.  She was actually the kind of person I wish I was.  She's very active.  Even with the secret identity, she still kept studying and going to school and actually gets good grades at that.  She has many friends despite the fact that she is a masochist.  I really wish Jay can finish off where Tonnie left off (*hint hint jay*).  I'm still wondering if I would get to beat Damon or die trying?  Well, Jay is the only one who knows...so Jay if you're reading this, HOW LONG WILL I BE WAITING??? :D

       Tests and more tests...   This is me resting because of all the work that I have to do.  I tried out these tests and they sure are funny. :D    Funny Asian Man    urlLink   What's Your Personality Type?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Hmmm.... I didn't actually see myself as a funny person but the test said so... :D    You're a Non-box.    urlLink   What box do you get put in?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Does this mean I'm a well rounded person? (despite my toothpick shape) :D   urlLink I Am   Which tarot card are you?   Undirected Creative Force. Open, receptive, devoid of pre-conceived notions. Beginnings. A young man holding the white rose of innocence in his left hand and grasping a vagabond's staff and satchel in the other, wanders with his gaze to the heaves, about to step into and abyss. His is the transformative journey of the spirit from innocence through experience into wisdom. his guardian and friend is the white dog symbolizing his own puppylike trust and fiath, for which the world labels him The Fool.    Now this I still don't understand why I was chosen to be a fool...  I really don't see my personality like this card.

       Headache, Fever and Friends   Up until today, I still have a fever but not as high as yesterday.  It's already beggining to be an annoyance rather than anything else.  For one, I can't even take a leave from work because I don't have sick leave.  Another thing is, I have so many things to do today that I just can't leave it alone.  On a good note though, I don't think my cold will become a full blown virus that would make me look like "Rudolf the Red-nosed Reindeer".  I think by Friday, I'll be breathing fine.  But the fever is already getting to me.  Yesterday, I couldn't even work properly because I felt so cold and my head was spinning and I was in the verge of being delusional.  I couldn't think straight.  I honestly didn't remember writing a blog.  And by the end of the day, I have a splitting headache that felt like my head was going to explode.  It was so painful I have to ask a friend of mine (the one I treat like a younger brother) to pick me up here at my workplace.  Good thing he was kind enough to do it.  Friends are really good to have around.  Honestly, if it wasn't for that friend of mine I wouldn't know how I would be getting home yesterday.  Anyway, thanks to my friend I got home safely but not without seeing another long lost friend.  We were walking in SM Southmall (we need to pass by the mall to get to my home) when we saw him/her (he's gay).  It was really nice to see old friends again.  We got to reminisce out high school times together and what already happened to out other friends and classmates.  We got to know what's been happening with everyone we know then and it was really good despite the headache and fever that I have.  Anyway, despite the fever and headache, I actually had fun.  It's really good to see old friends and get to know what's been happening with them.  Lesson to be learned, "keep in touch with old friends.  It's worth it."

       Dreams....     You are a Day Dreamer..   Daydreamers tend to be away from the normal, and have a deeper aspect when looking at things. Most of the time, thier outcasts of the social society, but don't worry. It just means your so deep it scares thier simple little brains.    urlLink   What kind of Dreamer are you?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    Funny how this test is so write about me though I never thought that I would be this kind of dreamer....  And speaking of dreams...I had a weird dream last night.  It actually involves my RPG characters and me.  There was Wolf and his trusty familiar - a hawk named Arrow (my first Exalted character who can't read and write though his familiar can), Midnight Gem (my other Exalted character who is the most beautiful thief in the land), Tonnie Seawolf (my favorite Mage:the Ascencion character who was a masochist teenager who doesn't know how to use a gun and uses Bruce Lee's spirit to help her fight her battles) and Rei Nightblade (my StarWars character who's a force adept).  And of course, me.  We were in La Salle that time.  I guess I was waiting for my college friends in the usual tambayan we had near the College canteen (now known as C squared) when suddenly someone screamed, "Stop theif!!!"  Suddenly, a drop dead gorgeous brunette landed on my tambayan's table and faced me (I was reading a book that time).  She smiled her gorgeous smile and jumped of the table and started running away at lightning speed.  When she was out of sight this long haired guy came running by dressed in blue chain mail with a hawk perched in his shoulder.  He suddenly turned to his hawk and were having a bit of a funny conversation.  He said,"what do you mean it was my fault we lost her?  Why don't you fly ahead and go after her instead of being perched on my shoulder weighing me down?"  He gave an audible sigh and went to my table yet again.  He sat down on one of the chairs and sighed yet again completely ignoring me.  His hawk flew away, I guess it was going to catch up on the girl.  When I was about to ask him who he is, the long haired guy suddenly  burst into a blue flame and a symbol of the sun shown in his forehead (kinda like when Gouku charges up in Dragonball).  He suddenly said, "alright I'm on my way."  He jumped so high he reached the rooftop of the cafeteria which was around 3 story high and disappeared from my sight.  When I thought that was over, two girls came running down SJ walk again.  Though it seem like the usual thing students do, one of them was holding a red lightsaber while running from someone while the other one was chanting, "Bruce where the hell are you!?"  They stopped yet again in front of my tambayan and the girl with the lightsaber said, "I think we lost them." The other girl was ignoring her and was talking to open space saying, "what took you so long?  You better get into me quick because I sense that they're getting closer and I need to kick ass." The lightsaber girl turned to her and said, "are you done.  I can sense them and they're coming closer." No sooner than she said that when laser fire came raining down on the SJ Walk.  Students came running from all directions... Then suddenly, I woke up.  It was really a strange dream.  I don't even know why I dreamt that.  I guess it was because I still have a fever and I'm dilusional last night.  Anyway, I still went to work today despite of my fever.  Now I have a cold to nurse as well.  This is so not fair!  This is what you get when you do so many work and not get enough rest.  Anyway, I hope I get better soon or else I won't be able to leave on Satuday.  And I also hope that I won't get that kind of dream again.  Even though it was weird and funny, I had actually wished that I was doing something else than just looking at what was happening around me...I could have kicked some serious butt. :D

       Just Another Blah Kind of Day...   Yesterday when I was checking my friends blogs, I saw one of them was going to have his final interview today.  I wish that friend of mine good luck and hope that he gets the job he really wants.  Today, we don't have work.  It's a national holiday commemorating People Power Revolution.  I am happy about this.  At least I won't have to face my aunt today.  At least for just one day, I will have a peace of mind on a weekday.  Honestly speaking, if I didn't like the cause they were fighting for I would have gotten the job.  I was offered another job which is closer to home but I took this job instead because I believe in their cause.  Sometimes, I am thinking whether I did the right thing.  I love the school setting.  You don't have work on Saturdays.  That gives me free time to actually go out with my friends and have fun.  I love RPG Saturdays as well.  One of the reasons why I look forward to the weekends is because of this.  It's amazing where you can go while you just sit around with your friends. :D  I'm looking forward to another fun filled Satuday of Role Playing.  And I'm honestly trying to finish the game that I usually hold for them.  I'll write about it someday when I have a lot to talk about.  But in the meantime, I have to finish the scenario for them.  I still have fever and cold.  I really hate this.  It was fine when it was just the fever but of all the viruses I can get, I got the common cold.  It's really annoying when you have a cold.  I'd rather have the chicken pox or the measles than the common cold.  Though I can't leave the house if I have chicken pox or measles but at least I can breathe better.  At least I don't have to blow my nose every 10 minutes and sneeze every 15.  It's so annoying!  Anyway, I hope I get better by Friday.  Can't enjoy playing RPG if I sneeze or blow my nose while playing right?  'Til then, I'll be drinking plenty of fluids and eat lots of fruits rich in vitamin C.  I really hate getting a cold. :(

       Rant and Rave...Little Wolf Style   This has been the weirdest day that has happened to me.  I have been scolded at, I had mistakes here and there, and a power surge that made me crazy for a little while. But through it all, it was okay since I get to be with someone I haven't seen in a long time.  First off, my rants.  I have an impossible aunt whom I am unfortunately working with.  I went to the office today at 7:50am...on regular days I would have been early but since we have a seminar today, I was late.  But I have a good reason to be late.  It was traffic.  Metro Manila is so full of these traffic jams that I'm use to it by now but today wasn't really a good day for it though.  My other good reason is that I have a fever.  I was really sluggish because I don't want to push myself too much...being sickly and all, I really have to take care of myself.  Anyway, when I arrived there, she already went on and on babbling about how wrong it was for me to be late at a time like this.  I should have been early...blah...blah...blah (I was only half-listening since I am sick after all).  Don't get wrong. I have always been Ms. Punctual.  I have never been late on any appointment whatsoever.  This has been the first time that has happened to me.  The reason why I'm pissed off is because she should know this!  She's my aunt after all and she did live with us long enought to know our personalities!  But no, she kept on blabbling about how it's so wrong!  But finally she realized that I wasn't feeling well.  But instead of symphatizing, she went on telling me how wrong I was not to call just to say that I can't come to work.  Now, this got me confuse...First she scolded me for not arriving on time, then she started scolding me for coming to work at all!!!  I do not understand that woman at all!!!  Worst part of it is, she just can't seem to separate me as her niece and me as an employee of the department that she's in.  She keeps molding it together that it shouldn't be.  For one, she's not my boss.  My boss is her boss as well.  We both work directly under her.  If ever there was someone who should be scolding me, it should be my boss and not her.  And my boss only advised me (take note: "advised" not "scold") me about two things...my clothes for the day [she told me I should have worn nicer clothes - which was entirely my fault since I only wore shirt and jeans that time when I was really planning to wear a decent blouse and jeans  (I was a runner and documentor that time, I have to wear comfortable clothes to move around) ] and the misunderstanding about the junk dealers (i was suppose to put their names and contact number on the list but what I did was call them to ask for their handouts for photo-copying purposes).  But all in all, she told me I did a good job.  I actually apologized for my screw-ups that day bur she said that it was alright.  She even thanked me for the job I did (running around the school, answering questions of some participants as best I could, going to and from different buildings and banks).  Anyway, I really wish that my aunt is like that.  The only reason I actually tolerate her is because of my father.  My dad loves his sisters very much that it's only out of respect for him that I'm doing this.  I would have answered her in front of everybody if it wasn't for my dad.  She's lucky I love my father very much to just sit down and keep quiet with the whole ordeal.  To top of my ranting, I was already writing in this blog about today's happenings when suddenly there was a power surge.  The computer died momentarily and it erased all that I have wrote in this blog.  Hence, I have to write again.  But I had to scandisk first and defragment the computer to check if there are any errors and stuffs.  After 30 minutes of checking, it was finally done but the computer was torturing me yet again.  It won't go online!!!  We have to restart the computer three times (excluding the power surge) to get it running again.  I was honestly praying like hell (kinda ironic, ain't it? "Praying like hell"?...:D) so that nothing bad would happened to the computer.  Thank God (the one above and not below) that He answered my prayer.  I finally got online and started writing again...  (and my first entry was already long. :'( )   Anyway, today wasn't actually all bad.  I got to spend some time with an old friend of mine whom I have treated like a baby brother when we were in High School.  Ever since I got in touch with him again, I sort of been asking him to wait for me when he goes home (he works in Makati so we usually meet in Glorietta).  I really missed having him around when we weren't in touch during those college years.  He was the only friend I have who I actually don't mind calling me "Ate".  And it was really nice to hear him say it to me again.  Anyway, at least I ended my day well.  I can actually go to sleep knowing that another day is through.  Another challenge passed.  Let's see what tomorrow's adventure will take me.

       At long last...   Finally after one year and three months I've finally finished reading "The Fellowship of the Ring"!  This has been the longest time I have ever read any book.  And I thought Shakespeare was hard to read, Tolkien was even harder!  But the good thing about it is that it was a good read.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  Reading the Fellowhip was really hard even though it's a very interesting book to read.  The reason I took so long to read it is because I have to stop every chapter and rest my brains.  The way Tolkien describe everything in the story was really nerve racking.  My mind just keeps going on and on and on about the places, peoples and things that are being describe in the book.  It's really hard to keep reading when you're already mentally drained after a chapter.  And though the movie helped in visualizing some things, thee are still more of them that needs to be visualized.    So, I have to stop and refresh my brains.  I read other books in between LOTR.  From Starwars to Harry Potter, and other books.  One book in between chapters just to get my imaginative juices to work yet again.  As I've said, it took time, but it was worth it.  I loved every moment of it.  From the party in the Shire, going to Bree and meeting Galadriel in Lorien it was amazing.  It keeps me going to places and meeting people along the way.  It feels like I was one of the nine companions.  Next book, the Two Towers...I wonder how long I'm going to read that as well.  But I am determined to finish this book before the Return of the King will be shown in the movie houses.  I reall hope I can do it this time. Wish me luck. :D

       Tonnie Seawolf can Kick Serious Ass!!!   Here I am again, doing the usual thing I do at work (AKA bored and not doing anything important) when I friend Jay also had the same dilemna.  To get rid of our problem, we had decided to play RPG via Yahoo! Instant Messenger.  This is the first time I am going to do this since we usually meet when we play RPG.  And since I left Jay to deal with the dice rolls (mostly because I don’t have my own set of dice and I’m in the office after all), my job is to “act out” what my character Tonnie should be doing in the situation.  So, let me just get into my writing shoes and relate to you what happened through Tonnie’s eyes.   There I was, dragged out of the physical plane and into the umbra.  I had been here before, that time when Ann sacrificed herself just to save us.  I remembered that day like it was only yesterday.  And it kept on haunting me even when Matthew was already born and my husband long dead and living in my knife.  I was still painful as I recall that day.  And I guess Damon thought that in brining me to his realm he could easily kill me because of those painful memories.  He was wrong.  The Place looks like hell.  The throbbing walls and floors of muscle are now a soft spongy mass, with strange umbral maggots feasting on the remains of Kemmler's realm. The giant corpse of the dead pregnant woman lies in a state of half decay on the wall, her abdomen slashed open.  To my left there is nothing but void, nearly half of the realm sent into oblivion by Cutter's Nuke.  I gave a silent bow to my friend Cutter for the good job that he has done with the place.  A small smile crept up my face as I saw the devastation around me.  I looked up and saw Damon.  He was hovering above me, several cables sputtering sparks as he takes out Hellrazor and holds it to one side.  His avatar was pumping so hard like it was about to explode.  Electronic cables of some sort were connected to Damon making them look like one entity.  "My father sends his regards, Seawolf." He snarls, "By the time I'm done with you, his revenge against Alex and Angela will be complete."  He was in pain, I could see it.  Even if he hides it from me with his smart wisecracks, it doesn’t take much for someone with my expertise to see if someone is suffering or not.  I am the embodiment of pain.  Torment and torture doesn’t pass me without my knowing.  All these years that I have been a masochist, I know the different aspects of pain.  I could see it when others don’t.  I feel it and take pleasure of the sweet agony that it gives me.  Pain has been a part of my blood that moment my parents died in the hands of the Technocracy.  I am pain.  And I smile at the thought of knowing that Damon was in pain.  Pain because of my making.  I brought out my knife, the ancient knife given to me so long ago by my grandfather.  In it is the spirit of the knife combined with my husband’s soul plus all other souls who were willing enough to help us in our crusade.  Against my will, I had agreed in adding Andrew in my knife.  A last wish he asked of me so that even in death we could be together…my pacifist husband, he must be screaming inside that knife every time I use it to defend myself.  I looked up at Damon with a with a half-smile on my face, crouching low getting ready to strike, I said, "That's Mrs. Seawolf-Crescent to you, little boy..."  I cried out and jumped up at Damon bringing in all the force I could get from myself and Brus – the spirit who was willingly helping me out by adding his strength, personality and ideals.  Honestly, I was hoping to be helped my Bruce Lee.  He has helped me more times in the past than any other spirit that has helped me before but he wasn’t there the time I called out to him instead Brus answered my call.  We got out on the wrong foot but he’s helping me out with everything he’s got now.  I guess after trying to call out to Bruce Lee again and still didn’t answer, he got mad and I guess was trying to prove himself to me that he could be better than the Hong Kong legend.  Damon wailed as I hack downwards with my spirit knife, digging deep into his arm opposite his elbow, swinging my legs over to carve a straight line around his arm, sparks flying as I cut it clean off his arm, his sword landing with a sick squelch as it lands on the floor.   "AAAarrrghh!" Damon shrieked as he pulled back, extending his other arm to fire off a bolt of pure Entropy...  I landed next to his arm still with a smile on my face.  I picked up his arm and raised it for him to see.  “If I must,” I said.  “I will take you a piece at a time.”  This got Damon mad.  You can see it as he readied himself to attack.  With a word of power, Damon unleashed to Entropy bolt, sending it crackling with energy towards me.  Narrowing my eyes, I darted quickly to one side barely evading the energy ball as it vaporizes the floor where I were standing, dark, foul smelling ichor bubbling up from the wound even as I regain my balance.  That was too close…WAY TOO CLOSE…  But I pretended not to care.  I was exhausted after my last attack but I ignored it.  I can feel pain in my body and feels soooo gooood!!!  Brus was confused and could not understand why I enjoyed feeling the pain.  But he continued to help me.  He was helping me get passed the exhaustion.  I looked up at Damon and tried to anger him more by saying, "I guess you're losing your touch Damon.  You couldn’t hit me even if you tried."  I jumped up again and tried to slash his other arm out as well.  As I jumped again knife ready, Damon whirled around, muttering something under his breath.  I felt myself knocked away.  I fell to the ground, the wind knocked out of me, every part of my body was aching and it feels sooo wonderful!!! My head cleared out from the clouds and I know what to do.  It took time before I got up again.  Damon probably thinks that I was knocked out called because he flew up out of reach.  I can see that his eyes are closed and very slowly tendrils began to snake out of his severed arm.  He was beginning to regenerate.  I looked around if I could find anything that could be useful to throw at him.  I know that if I don’t stop him now, he will get his old strength back and I have no way of stopping him.  Even with Brus inside me, I know it was impossible if he regained that arm once more.  Unfortunately, there was nothing in that place that could help me out.  There were a lot of maggots, dead flesh and the giant woman's corpse, but nothing that could help me out in this situation.  I looked down at my knife and sighed.  I hadn’t done this trick at all but I have no choice.  The chances of success is very limited but I have to give it a try.  It was the only way to defeat him.    I gripped my knife until my knuckles began to whiten with the effort.  Looking at it memorizing the curves and the intricate design of the handle, I know it will be the last time I will see it that way.  I took a few deep breaths and tried to concentrate.  I held my amulet that was around my neck and focused on the power within it.  I started talking to my knife, explaining to it what was about to happen.  “You have to help me out with this sweetie,” I said softly like I would a child.  “It’s the only way.”  With that, I readied to throw it at the resting Damon.  Still holding my amulet for support, I took one last look at my beloved knife before I threw it at Damon’s direction.  Damon's eyes open in shock as I hurled my spirit knife towards him. In mid-air the knife sang with the voices of your ancestors, my beloved husband and all the souls of Damon's victims as a stream of soul energy trailed after the weapon, rising up like a miniature star towards him...  Damon cried out as the knife struck his heart, burrowing inside his chest as the spirit energy lashes out to him, tearing through every single fiber of his being, the song of the spirits rose in triumph as Damon's burnt hulk of a body falls unceremoniously to the ground... The knife's handle clatters to one side of him, thin tendrils of smoke rising from it. The blade is gone, shattered into uncounted shards when it struck Damon to deal the killing blow...  A tear escaped my eye as I saw what happened.  It was like a piece of me has been cut out of my body and I wasn’t whole anymore.  It was like losing my husband all over again.  And with Matthew still missing, that was the only comfort that I had.  Now it was gone… “That was for Ann, you bastard.” I said in triumph despite the pain.  As I inspect Damon’s remain, I saw something glowing in the umbra.  I went closer to pick it up, and I saw a trail of spirit energy following it where your blade used to be.  “It’s not the end after all,” I said to myself smiling.  Still smiling, I slash it in midair, parting the Umbra once again.  Using my knowledge of the spirit world to guide you back to the world as you left it but stopped suddenly as I saw a glimpse of something shinny near Damon’s body.  I looked back and saw a crystal-like object.  I remembered it came from Creation.  And I sensed Ms. Angela’s and Dr. Alex’s presence there.  “What the hell are they doing in Creation?” I wondered aloud.  There was only way to find out.  I have to go there as well.   I have to talk to Jay so we could continue Tonnie's Adventure.  Hope you guys liked it.  Feel free to email me your comments as well. :D

Christianity links the unicorn with Christ. It is said that unicorns would only allow virgin girls to see them, let alone touch them. They were easily lured into fatal ambushes by a virgin with some potchers waiting for the unicorn in nearby bushes. A unicorn's horn was a highly prised possesion, which was reputed to have great healing capabilities. With the touch of its horn, a unicorn could bring back a person who had been dead for several hours. But when disattached from the unicorn's body, the magic was suggnificantly reduced and could only protect against poison. The unicorn had the body of a horse, a unique spirling horn, and a lion's tail. They were pure white in color. Congradulations, you are a rarity amoung mythical beasts.

       On An F1 High!!!    “As all four lights go out signaling the start of the Australian GP…3…2…1….and there they Go!”   Another season of hot racing action as the start of the F1 season begins again! Tonight is the start of pre-qualifying of the 2003 Formula One Grand Prix Race.    I’m on an F1 high! Who would not like to see fast cars going around 78 times on a track going 200-300kph driven by cute guys on fire proof overalls? :D  It’s honestly an exciting/boring sport.  And I love every moment of it!  I haven’t actually been watching F1 that long.  I’ve only started last 2001 because we didn’t have cable back then.  It was just by accident that I got to watch this sport.  My older sister and older brother were watching it and I took a peek.  I didn’t realize that I will get hooked on the tube watching 24 cars go round and round a track in a particular country and just wait for accidents, penalties, pit-stop strategies and overtaking maneuvers as you glued your eyes on the tv set.  It was really amazing how exciting it could be seeing people try to overtake the person in front of them and then that same person will try to get his place back from his over-taker.  But it actually becomes boring if you see the same person in the front row winning every single race.  There’s no challenge anymore.  When I started watching F1, I was routing for the Williams driver Ralph Schumacher.  He’s the younger brother of F1 champion Michael Schumacher.  He’s got potential, and a very talented driver at that.  And he’s determined to beat his brother while they race.  It’s really amazing how close they are when they’re not racing and actually pretend that they’re not related when they’re on the track.  There were occasions that Ralph beat Michael and actually won podium finish.  I’ve seen that a few times on previous races but recently, Ralph couldn’t do it anymore.  Not because he’s not good it’s just because the car isn’t as reliable.  But I’m still waiting for that time that he could be F1 champion and not Big Schumi (commentators differentiate the two brother by Big Schumi as Michael and Little Schumi for Ralph).  But just last year, I got to see another potential for the title.  Kimi Raikkonen.  He debut during the 2001 season with nothing but a Formula Renault champion added to his name and a talent which no one can deny.  He started out as the no.2 driver for Sauber Petronas and won the hearts of different F1 fans!  He’s got looks and he’s got exceptional talent.  He’s the only driver I know (but I’m not sure of this) who was granted the super license without any experience in the F3 circuit, which I guess you need if you want to drive in F1.  People already saw his potential as an F1 driver when he was in Sauber and last year, he surprised everyone when he won third place in the Australian GP.  He also got the crowds attention when he did a good job during the rainy season when you need to race in wet conditions were the tracks are slippery and you have a hard time controlling the car.  If it wasn’t for the blunder of the pit crew and the management, he would have gotten a better place in the race that time. Just imagine, he was honestly just a nobody at the start of the race during 2001 winning only 6th place or 4th place during those times but when he took the place of Mika Hakkinen in the Mclaren team, being the second driver to David Coultard, he became an instant celebrity.  Now joining the ranks of drivers he used to admire and now going up against them, he has a future in the F1 world.  I believe that he can even beat Michael Schumacher if their car will be reliable.  I’m counting the hours before the pre-qualifying starts!  I just can’t wait ‘til Sunday when I will see my champion ride his silver horse and sweep the gold out of Schumacher’s hand.  I’m waiting in anticipation.

       Lost and confused   I have this misfortune of getting lost in Malate yesterday.  Good thing, it was only a temporary relapse of not understanding the instructions given to us by our friend.  Anyway, ther are times when I go home, I wait for my baby brother who works in Makati.  Yesterday was that kind of day but with a sudden twist, I also asked another friend of ours if she wants to come with us going home since this March my baby brother will start to go home at 7pm.  That would be about the same time she goes home as well.  I thought that what the heck since they go out about the same time and I get to Glorietta at 7pm, it would be great to add another person in our company.  So, I asked her and she agreed to come with us.  Unfortunately for us, she got caught up with work and couldn't get out early.  She suggested to pick her up in her office which me and Dean (my baby brother) agreed to.  So we asked her for directions on how to get there and that's when the problem started.  She told us to get down in Quirino and just walk until we find a 7-11 and Milans then make a right.  The place was which was fairly located in Singgalong.  Dean knows where Singgalong is so I thought we won't have a problem with the directions.  Boy was I wrong.  When we got down in Quirino, we started walking until we found Singgalong but we couldn't find 7-11 or Milans.  When we got there, that where we got confused.  She didn't tell us if we will go right or left so we don't know where to go from there.  We texted her if we were on the right track and all she said was "yes" but didn't tell us if we were suppose to go left or right.  We walked for about 10mins. until we finally realize that it was the wrong way.  So we have to turn around and go back to the other way.  Eventually we found our landmarks but we took the wrong turn yet again.  So we have to back track the second time and finally we found Lea's office.  It turns out that the street that Lea (my friend) told us wasn't Quirino at all.  Dean said that it was San Andres.  We should have gone down at San Andres and walked until we find a 7-11 and Milans then make a right.  If we've gone down in San Andres, we would have walked a long way.  It was pretty close to Lea's office than in Quirino.  No offense to my friend Lea, she's a very good friend and I love her very much but she should give better directions next time...or check the street signs at her place so she would mistaken San Andres to Quirino next time. :D  Don't worry Lea, we still love you. :D  But I enjoyed the journey home.   It was really great and I had another adventure to add on my list of adventures in life. :D  Anyway, it was really fun going home. Lea was really very talkative and asking about our past classmates and villains in our lives, aka SAWASHOs.  But the SAWASHOs will be discussed on a future blog when I actually have the stomach to talk about them.  And on other news, I finally got to figure out what to do with that accounting problem that I have that has tormented me for 4 working days and 2 weekends...couldn't actually concentrate on the Modern day Exulted game last Saturday because of it.  At last, I had it typed and really for printing today. :D  But I still have to cross my fingers and pray that it was the right solution.

       Reflections yet again    "You Catholics do not celebrate your religion...you mourn it." - Selma Hayek, Dogma   Up until now, I still haven't solve my accounting problem.  I have found a way to actually fix it but unfortunately the Task Force is giving me a hard time.  I really don't know where they get the budget for  their particular sectors.  I have searched every single budget that was made for this project but I couldn't find where the hell did they get the money to adjust their budget.  It seemed to have appeared out of nowhere.  Anyway, today is Ash Wednesday.  It's the start of the start of Lent (I hope I got the spelling write or my religion teachers will kill me) and it's also a start of fasting and abstinence.  All my life, even when I was a kid we have been practicing fasting and abstinence at home.  Even if I was only 7 years old at that time, we were not allowed to eat meet starting Ash Wednesday and every Friday until Good Friday.  It was like a tradition in the family to do so.  Fasting for us starts when you turn 18, hence unfortunately even if I really need to eat a lot, I have to refrain my self from eating rice during the day time.  So at the moment I have bread for my breakfast and lunch...here's hoping I get through today. :D  Anyway, the funny thing is, even though the Church has already gave the "law" of fasting and abstinence only on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday, we still practice the no meat every Friday but we can eat rice 3 times a day...at least I can eat rice during lunch...hehe.  I guess we were already used to that practice and start to get ourselves ready for Holy Week.  I guess it's just my families way of joining in the sacrifices that Kuya Jess has done just to save our souls.  I remember my father when he was still here.  He doesn't eat during these times.  I only see him drink water the whole day until dinner but I never saw him eat.  Now that is such a sacrifice.  But I guess he has been doing that since way before since I know his mother, my grandmother is a very religious woman.  So I guess that she taught them the Catholic way of celebrating Holy Week.  I guess having a very religious family can do this to you.  The good thing about it is that you get very high grades in all your religion subjects and you actually get to debate about religious issues that have been wondering about all these years.  The down side is that friends tend to see you as weird and going over board.  In a way, I actually agree with what Selma Hayek said in Dogma.  We Catholics tend to give more emphasis on Christ's death than all the good things he has done to the world.  The Church just consider all his good works an "ordinary sunday" and when it's lent, we have forty days of reflection...fasting and abstinence...processions, salubongs, stations of the cross and so on and so forth.  Why won't the Church view this as an "ordinary sunday" and the rest of the happy gospels a special sunday.  Anyway, I guess I wouldn't really know what the Church is thinking.  But for me, I'll see to it that I can celebrate it as much as practicing Lent.

       Another Blah Day...   Today, it's back to work for me.  I am going to be doing the same thing that I was suppose to be doing last Friday.  Here's hoping that today, I get to do my job.  It's really such a depressing day for me today.  I'm still blue from what happened to me last Saturday and Sunday.    Last Saturday I bought a book out of impulse and just right after I paid for it and left the bookstore, I regretted it.  Honestly, this is the very first time I regretted buying a book.  I never regret buying a book however expensive they may be.  But this time, I really regretted it very much.  It might be because I could have used that money to reload my cellphone (I ran out of credits last night) or have my phone change backlight, so my phone won't be the twin brother of Jay's phone. :D  Anyway, yesterday there was a sale in SM Southmall, the mall nearest my home.  Anyway, yet again we went inside a bookstore supposedly to by Pannini stickers for our Harry Potter Sticker album.  We couldn't find any. :(  Now I don't know where to find one. :(  Another depressing note that day while we search for those stickers is that I saw a Formula 1 magazine with my favorite driver on the cover.  It also said that it has a 3page article about that driver.  The magazine was P600.  Hence, too expensive for me so I can't buy it. :(  I honestly wanted to buy that magazine so much.  For one, it has an article on my favorite driver and two, it's the last copy.  Life can be so cruel.  I didn't find any Pannini and I can't buy the F1 magazine.  I guess I'll live.  I've lived without reading it before, I can still survive...I hope.

       Nokia, connecting people...   Anyway, yesterday was an average day for me.  I got to relax, saw my friends, freaked my aunt and get to see more old friends....  This year is the year I get to see old friends again.  And it started with just an SMS message from my "baby brother".  From then on, people started to get in touch again.  It's like my phone has finally heard it's calling and started to do it's job.  Makes me remember of the slogan of my phone, "Nokia, connecting people."  It's really amazing meeting old friends again.  You get to see the changes they had done to themselves since you've last seen them.  It's really great to see how well they turned out or if you like that person less, how you've turned out better than them.  To me, it's a sight to behold.  I guess, this will be a good year to me...where my relationships with other people is concerned though.  Now, if I could only find a way to get rich...

       What Are You Doing Bee?   Bees.  Small but scary little insects they are.  I was doing my job, minding my own business when suddenly this bee appeared.  I just ignored it for the first few minutes thinking that it will be gone very soon but it kept going around my table and chair I think checking my things it they can get nectar from it.  It kept doing that for a full 30 minutes and then left only to return and do it again for another 30 minutes.  Finally, it really left.  This are those times that I wish our office was air-conditioned.  That way stray insects won't find it's way to my desk looking for nectar.  This has been the first time a bee came and disrupted my work.  I wouldn't actually have a problem if it were a butterfly.  Butterflies tend to like my monitor very much and decorate it for an hour or so before leaving in search of flowers.  But bees are a different story all together.  They sting.  And it really hurts not to mention that the sting will be throbbing for weeks.  Now I have something new to fear...bees.  I am presently afraid of cats because of my experience with the cat at home. Now, I'm afraid of bees because of what happened.  I honestly can't stop shaking after the incident.  I am presently shaking while I'm writing this blog.  I have weird fears.  Why can't I be afraid of the dark? Or heights? Or water?  Instead I have fear of cats and bees.  I'm not allergic, I'm just so freakin' scared of them.  I have to stop shaking...I can't work if I don't stop.  Hopefully I can finish my job before the day ends.  I guess now I have two things I fear most...cats and bees.

       Bravery    "Bravery isn't about not being afraid.  It's about being scared and still not giving in  - Rachel of Animorphs, The Reaction  Bravery.  We all have a different meaning for it.  But in my opinion, Rachel is right.  It's not about being not afraid, it's about controlling your fear and finish the job that you need to do.  Soldiers are brave.  They may fear death but they still go to war because it's their job to serve their country.  That's the reason why they're in the force after all.  But I'm sure they're afraid everytime they go in the line of fire.  Fear of getting injured or even dying my even be running in their minds while they are out there but they still go.  They still charge to enemy lines because they need to.  They have to muster the courage to go and do their job even if they are afraid of what the consequence of charging will be.   "Being brave, doesn't mean that you should go looking for trouble."  Something Mufasa had said to a young Simba when he went to the elephant graveyard.  You don't have to show off for people to see that you're a brave person.  It just happens.  You don't have to go looking for trouble for you get noticed that you're brave.  Bravery is something that you have inside of you whether you're skinny, sickly or even crazy.  The best time to be brave is when nobody is expecting you to do it.  For you to show who you really are to your friends and collegues...to me that's bravery.

       Let’s Talk about Twins F    Raistlin’s Good-bye   in Dragonlance: Test of the Twins   He screamed, and he would scream, and he would keep on screaming, unendingly…  Something touched him…a hand…He clutched at it as it shook him gently.  A voice called, “Raist! Wake up!  It was only a dream.  Don’t be afraid.  I won’t let them hurt you!  Here, watch…I’ll make you laugh.”  The dragon’s coil tightened, crushing out his breath.  Glistening black fangs ate his living organs, devouring his heart.  Tearing into his body, they sought his soul.  A strong arm encircled him, holding him close.  A hand raised, gleaming with silver light, forming childish pictures in the night, and the voice, dimly heard, whispered, “Look, Raist, bunnies…”  He smiled, no longer afraid.  Caramon was here. The pain eased.  The dream was driven back.  From far away, he heard a wail of bitter disappointment and anger.  It didn’t matter.  Nothing mattered anymore.  Now he just felt tired, so very, very tired… Leaning his head upon his brother’s arm, Raistlin closed his eyes and drifted into a dark, dreamless, endless sleep.   Twins.  Such fascinating people they are.  They are very unique despite the appearance.  In Dragonlance, you can clearly see it with Caramon and Raistlin Majere.  One was a healthy warrior who was good the other was a sickly mage who serves darkness.    The excerpt was taken from the last part of the Test of the Twins where Raistlin fought the Dark Goddess Takhisis.  Raistlin was about to die that time but the dark queen stopped, all because of the bond Raistlin shared with his brother.  That bond, whether it was love or something else hindered the dark queen in punishing and hurting the young mage who sought after her throne as a god.  Knowing that Caramon will never leave his side wherever life takes him, Raistlin was saved.  The queen can no longer torment him.   He was untouched from her powers.  Without that bond, Raistlin would surely be experiencing eternal damnation.  Even if they are already worlds apart, Caramon will always be there for Raistlin because that’s how twins are.  I have always wondered what it would be like to have a twin.  I have the misfortune of having no twin so I really don’t know how it feels like having one.  I know it can be annoying at times because being twins, having a clone of some sort your parents usually color code you just to know one from the other.  You share everything together, friends, clothes, education, etc.  People tend to mistake one from the other.  And if one made a mistake, both of you are to blame, not only one.  But there are upside to it as well.  For one, you have this kind of connection that no one else has.  Even if it isn’t supernatural like having a telepathic link of some sort, there is still a certain connection where all you have to do is look at each other and you already know what the other is thinking (without taking in your mind) because you are so close…you have been together since the first nine months of your lives cramped in you mom’s womb after all.  Still, I wonder?  I have been fortunate to have to have friends who are twins.  And they have different personalities.  I still can’t tell one from the other at a glance but once I started talking to them. I know who they are already.  Take the example of the Robi and Regi.  They’re my RPG friends I meet weekly in Greenbelt.  These two are identical twins and at a glance, you can’t tell one from the other, except for the fact that one is slightly larger than the other but you won’t notice it until you get a closer look at them.  And once you get to talk to them and play with them, you’ll get to know who’s who at a grander scale.  Regi tends to be more silent than Robi who is more vocal when playing.  Robi tries to counter your every move while Regi just accept what’s happening and tend to leave it at that.  Robi tends to be spontaneous sometimes while Regi follows the norms of playing RPG.  The twins also have a color-coding scheme.  While Robi wears green, Regi tends to wear blue all the time.  And they told us that that is the only color they wear, nothing else.  But both brothers are really nice and jolly all the time.  I wish I had a twin.  I guess it would be great and at the same time scary.  There are some cases after all that they have different personalities that one tends to be good and the other evil.  It kind of made me think as well.  What if you’re so identical, no one can tell you two apart?  What if your twin was evil and wants everything you have?  What if she makes a lot of mischief and blames you for all of them?  That is one scary thought.  Having a twin is really great at the same time scary.  But I guess people who have twins wouldn’t trade their twin for the world.  It does have merits and also have flaws but since you’re so close to each other since before birth, you don’t care.  You are a unique pair to be reckoned with.

       Cold Sir...   I woke up this morning and was surprise to see myself shivering.  I had always thought that summer was on its way and the night will go warm and even warmer in the morning.  I got the shock of my life when I eventually took a pair of socks to go out and make my lunch for work.  But honestly speaking, I like the cold.  It might get harder for me to wake up very early in the morning but it beats too hot showers in the morning and too sticky afternoons before I go home (our office doesn't have air conditioning).  I get to wear thick jackets and stuffs and I won't even look ridiculous. :D  Anyway, it might be summer but it's cold.  I have to bear waking up early in the morning when all I want is to stay in bed and sleep more.  Well, I better enjoy it before the real summer comes...then it's back to very hot morning showers and too sticky afternoons.

       A Very Nice Song   I really like this song.  I have this thought that is somewhat like a half-joke that I would marry the guy who would sing this to me in public... I've been coaxing my boyfriend to sing it to me...   If You're not the One by Daniel Bedingfield   If you’re not the one then why does my soul feel glad today?  If you’re not the one then why does my hand fit yours this way?  If you are not mine then why does your heart return my call?  If you are not mine would I have the strength to stand at all?   I never know what the future brings  But I know you are here with me now  We’ll make it through  And I hope you are the one I share my life with   I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand  If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?  Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?   If I don’t need you then why am I crying on my bed?  If I don’t need you then why does your name resound in my head?  If you’re not for me then why does this distance maim my life?  If you’re not for me then why do I dream of you as my wife?   I don’t know why you’re so far away  But I know that this much is true  We’ll make it through And I hope you are the one I share my life with  And I wish that you could be the one I die with  And I prayin’ you’re the one I build my home with  I hope I love you all my life   I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand  If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?  Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?   ‘Cause I miss you, body and soul so strong that it takes my breath away  And I breathe you into my heart and pray for the strength to stand today  ‘Cause I love you, whether it’s wrong or right  And though I can’t be with you tonight  And know my heart is by your side   I don’t want to run away but I can’t take it, I don’t understand  If I’m not made for you then why does my heart tell me that I am?  Is there any way that I can stay in your arms?  This is such a sweet song... It has been number one at a local radio station for 3 weeks straight already. :D

       Something very Disturbing   I saw something really disturbing on my way to work this morning.  I was on a bus and when the bus stopped at Guadalupe, there was this middle aged man arguing with another bus driver that was in front of us.  It may seem very harmless but what's really disturbing is that the man was carrying a gun and pointing it at the driver.  The good news is that there were no blood shed that morning and the bus driver might have breathe a sigh of relief when the middle aged man went back to his car and sped off.  This is what guns do to people.  They think that they have the power to do anything to other people because they have the fire power.  They tend to threaten people weaker than them because they think that they are powerful with that gun on their hands.  Honestly speaking, I don't know what really happened to make that guy bring out his gun and point it at the driver but it's really wrong.  I know that bus drivers tend to hog the road and some really don't know driving ethics but that man has no right whatsoever to point a gun on another person and threaten him.  To think that our President is for private citizens carrying a gun.  I for one is against it and this morning's event proves that I'm right.  People will not see a gun for protecting themselves, they will use it for their own benefits like threatening people weaker than them so that they will get what they want.  And if private citizens will be allowed to carry guns outside their homes, it will not help this nation become a better place to live in.  Foreigners will not invest in this country because people are free to roam around and threaten anybody who's against them.  Everyone will live in fear, and I for one does not want to live in fear.  I want to go out and enjoy living without the fear of losing my life because of a brawl of two strangers carrying guns in the streets.  Guns for protection?  That's a load of crap!!! It won't protect the people you love but instead it will be the cause of their deaths.  Love life and Not death!  Say no to Guns!!!

       Some Words From People and other thoughts...    "The world is growing up...It's starting to get civilized and it's starting to becoming boring..."  - Zen Gezner, The Adventures of Sinbad   (WARNING: THE FIRST 3 PARAGRAPHS MAY OR MAY NOT MEAN ANYTHING WITH THE SAYING ABOVE...YOU MIGHT GET CONFUSED AND SUDDENLY DO AN ANIME AND SWEATDROP)   Today was a very up and down day for me.  I got to watch F1 and was fairly happy with the results (Kimi Raikkonen got 3rd place and MSchu was 4th) though I could have wanted either Kimi or Ralph to have won 1st place and not David Coultard.  But it was okay, at least Kimi had a podium finish and Ralph got the last point (he got 8th place).  Anyway, this morning I was a little frustrated with our cable company.  They just decided to update their signal right before F1 started.  I missed the first 30mins. of the race and by the time the signal cleared, a lot has already happened.  Barrichello was out of the game and so has Firman...Kimi had made a mistake and ended up having a drive through penalty...Michael dropped down to fourth place behind JPM and Ralph...Coultard made a pitstop after lap 1...and so on.  I have to watch the reruns again this evening in Chinese!!! And I can't even understand Chinese!!!  Anyway, to make things worse, this afternoon I went to the bookstore and found out the all the books that I wanted are out.  Why is it that everytime I don't have money, they tend to release those books and when I have the money, they're no where to be found.  Life's not fair...  Anyway, the world is growing up...and it's starting to get boring.  All you see now are people always in a hurry and not stopping to smell the flowers.  They don't tend to see the beauty that surrounds them nowadays.  All they could see are the problems that is around them now.  The upcoming war, aids, pollution, garbage, etc.  But what about the good things in life?  What ever happened to the magic of living?  What ever happened to people's imagination that had made the world so bright and happy to live in?  Before, a smile of a child can light up the world...that's magic.  Birds singing on a nearby tree...that's magic.  A rainbow decorating the sky...that's magic.  Children playing outside...that's magic.  Where is that magic now?  Where has it gone?  Where are the usual miracles that people stop to look at and enjoy?  Indeed, the world has grown up.  But does it have to be boring?

       A Day of Remembering   Today, I'm going to vere off the topic of war in the Middle East and commemorate this day for a good friend of mine.  Today is Kuya Dennis's birthday.  If he was alive, he would have been 24years old.  If he was alive today, I would have sent him a card with something that I know that he would love and mail it via LBC.  I would imagine him sending me and SMS or calling me to thank me for what I gave him.  He would laugh and tell jokes and stories of what had happened to him in the passed few weeks when we never did contact each other.  He would say thank you a zillion times before we finally put the phone down.  And at the end of the day, both of us will be smiling.  I wouldn't be able to do that now.  All I have is his memories.  Something I will cherish for the rest of my life.  And now I lift my glass up in salute to a wonderful person who had made my life worth living.  Your memories will never be gone while I'm around.   To you Kuya Dennis!!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!

       So It Begins…   War has finally come.  I just can’t believe that they couldn’t wait to show how powerful a nation they are.  Innocent people will be suffering because of the personal agenda Bush has with Saddam.  Clearly you can see that I still stand my ground that we should have talked about this first before any of this ever became a full scale war.  So much for the United Nations.  I guess the world isn’t united anymore since there’s a war brewing.  I really hate this.  People will die but these leaders say that it’s a risk that these soldiers will take.  I say that’s a load of crap.  It would have been much better if people don’t die at all.  More bloodshed that our children will see.  More violence that they will follow.  The future of the world will see that the only way to fix a situation is through violence.  Stupid US president.  Only thinks about his personal vendetta against Saddam.  He keeps insisting that they had failed negotiations with Iraq already.  What negotiations?!?! He didn’t let the UN investigation finish, now he’s saying that political negotiations has failed?!?  How stupid could you get?  I hate this war.  There is no basis for this war.  I really hate this.  I worry for the families of the soldiers.  They are fighting for something not worth fighting for.  I worry for my parents as well.  They are presently in Saudi Arabia and they told us that we shouldn’t worry because it’s far.  But if we in the Philippines worried because we might get bombed as well, why won’t we worry about them who is closer?  There is nothing to be done anymore.  I only hope now that it would be over and not lose people on both sides.    Here’s another song that is very right for the present situation.    From A Distance    From a distance The world looks blue and green And the small cap mountains white  From a distance The ocean meets the stream And the eagle takes to flight  From a distance there is harmony And it echoes through the land It’s the voice of hope, it’s the voice of peace It’s the voice of every man  From a distance We all have enough And no one is in need  And there are no guns,  No bomb, and no disease No hungry mouths to fee  From a distance we are instruments Marching in a common band Playing songs of hope, playing songs of peace They’re the song of every man  And God is watching us God is watching us God is watching us From a distance  From a distance You look like my friend Even though we are at war  From a distance I just cannot comprehend What all this fighting is for?  From a distance there is harmony And it echoes through the land It’s the hope of hopes It’s the love of loves This is the song of every man  It’s the voice of hope It’s the voice of peace It’s the voice of every man  And God is watching us God is watching us God is watching us From a distance  Oh God is watching us God is watching… God is watching us From a distance…

       Name That Tune   This is a very timely song... I hope the world leaders will listen to it before they make any more decisions about the upcoming war.  Little Child Dry your crying eyes How can i explain The pain you feel inside?  'Cause you were born Into this evil world Where man is killing man And no one knows just why  What have we become? Just look what we have done All that we've destroyed You must build again  When the children cry Let them know we try When the children sing Then a new world begins  Little child You must show the way For a better day For all the young  'Cause you were born For the world to see That we all should live With love and peace  No more president And all the wars will end One united world Under God  When the children cry Let them know we try 'Cause when the children sing Then a new world begins  What have we become? Just look what we have done All that we've destroyed You must build again  No more president And all the wars will end One united world Under God  When the children cry Let them know we try 'Cause when the children sing A new world beging  And when the children fight Let them know it ain't right So when the children sing Let a new world begins  So, have you already guess the name of the song?  It's a song by Def Leopards... Let's think about it and again reflect upon what has been said in the song.  Let us hope that the world leaders might rethink on what's going to happened if war ever break out.

       War, War, Stupid   I guess everybody know by now that war against Iraq will commence within a few days.  A stupid American and Spanish president, and an equally idiotic British Prime Minister thinks that the only way to solve this so called problem is through violence and war.  I don’t think that it’s a crisis.  I don’t think Iraq is a threat.  If they were a threat, they would have attacked way before especially that time of the 9/11.  America at that time has a target in its forehead ready to be taken down.  But Saddam didn’t attack, did he?  We didn’t have any problem with that country until the stupid American president thought that he was a threat to the country.  Saddam was busy running a  country rich in oil.  But he had no plans of taking down the US.  I guess it was just a vendetta against Saddam because of the war his father had with him years before.  Still I think that they should focus more on the Al-quaida.  They are the real threat to the world.  They were the ones who bomb the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.  They were the ones who killed innocent people with all those suicide bombings!  They should be the one these stupid leaders should put all their time and effort.  They should be the top priority of these 1st world countries and not Iraq who followed everything the UN ordered them to do.  They’re already disarming for crying out loud!!! Why don’t they just wait until they finish disarming.  The UN wanted that.  Why can’t these countries follow?  Isn’t that a reason why there is a United Nations?  To keep the peace?  Leaders of US, Spain and Britain.  If you won’t listen to the United Nations then listen to your people.  They have been camped out doing prayer rallies and the likes just so that war will not break out.  Americans, Spaniards and English.  People you lead and serve doesn’t want you to push through this.  Isn’t the US a democratic country?  The people has already spoken.  Why are you not listening to the cries of your people?    Have you ever wonder why there’s only the three of you who wants war and even if you keep trying to convince other nations, you will get the same result?  No one wants war, why would you want to wage war when it’s a lose-lose situation.  Do you really want to waste your resources just for something petty as this?  Do you want to be remembered as the leaders who wage a stupid war just to say that you can?  Your going to send your men to get killed just so that you can tell the world that you’re all powerful?  And you call yourselves leaders?  That’s a load of crap!!!  Our president isn’t any better.  Addressing Saddam to step down because Bush said so was the stupidest thing she has said.  Why don’t you just jump up and down calling their attention and say, “Here I am!!! Come and destroy our country!!!!”  The Philippines isn’t a rich country.  We have our own crisis to take care of.  We have our own terrorist group that needs to be sought out and destroyed as well.  Her saying that in public, was really a stupid thing to say.  It’s like she wanted to be part of a war.  A war that we can’t fight.  We don’t have the resources.  We don’t have the fire power.  If Iraq targets us because of our Midget president there will be nothing left of our country.  The 7,000++ island that we have at the moment would be reduced to only one because our president couldn’t stop opening her mouth.  She’s intelligent, I’ll give her that.  She’s an economist and honestly tried to get our economy back to a sort of normal pace.  She tried to get all the foreign investors back and slowly getting the peso back to a standstill.  But she should have thought and re-thought what she had said back then before she blurted it out for the whole nation to hear.  How could she bring her people in the line of fire?  By saying something, we become targets of this so-called war.  I don’t know about you but I don’t want war to break out.  I know that we can talk about this without having any bloodshed.  I know that we can work out something if we just sit down and talk things through.  I do not see the reason for war.  It’s really petty and besides, Saddam is already disarming those warheads.  Why do we need to attack?  Why do you want Saddam out of office when his people wanted him to stay where he is?  It’s not the US’s decision but the Iraqis who should be deciding whether they want a new president or not.

       Conversations with God      It might be funny but it really made sense.  If we think about it. Even though we have so many mistakes, even if we eventually do so many bad things in life, still God never cease to Love us.  We make mistakes.  We even ended up blaming God for the mistakes that we make but still he never cease to be there when we trully need it.  We have such a loving Dad.  I had always said that I can be angry at hime for one reason or another but I can never hate him.  Much like the kind of relationship a daughter has to a father.  Everyone of us makes mistakes.  But out dad never seem to judge us wrongly.  Instead, he tends to say that they love us still despite those mistakes.  Let us stop and think for a while.  Aren't we glad that our God is the kind of God that loves us despite the numerous times we let him down?

       Test, Test and More Tests   Here are some other test that I took a few weeks back but didn't get a chance to post it here.  Out of pure boredom and I have nothing to do anymore, I decided to go back to my blog and post a few more tests that I took. Enjoy! :D   urlLink       Take the  urlLink What High School Stereotype Are You?  quiz, by  urlLink Angel .  No argument here.  When I was in high school I was an Outsider.  I don't care actually. I never really liked my high school and the people there hence the reason why I don't try to get along with them.  The only reason I tolerated it was because I needed the education and the people in the choir are fairly good people whom I can tolerate.  I have friends there as well but I can only count them with only one hand.      urlLink       Take the  urlLink What Type of Friend are You?  quiz, and visit  urlLink mutedfaith.com .  urlLink [Me.]     Well, people didn't want to ge to know me when I was in high school but it's their loss not mine.  I'm a really good friend once you get to know me...Honest!!!      urlLink       Which Peanuts Character Are You Quiz       Cool, I'm the voice of reason...never saw that coming. :D     You are a freeform writer. Individualistic with a sense for the different and challenging, Walt Whitman and his poetry lacking meter and rhyme is just what the doctor ordered. You're quick to write something that the rest of the world doesn't accept as poetry, quick to separate yourself from the average joe. An author with a true sense of self, you have confidence in your abilities and aren't afraid to show it. :) GO YOU!    urlLink   What's YOUR Writing Style?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla    This I have to retake because the first time it said that I wasn't a writer at all...I just took the test again to make sure that they didn't make a mistake.  But I'm happy that they did.  I'm a free form writer, you can see that in my blogs. :D

       Birthdays, Friends and Whatever Happened to Mr. Bee?   First off, I would just like to say Belated Happy Birthday to my boyfriend's sister, Ate Yna who celebrated her birthday last Saturday, March 15.  And to my uncle Tito Dodong, who celebrated it yesterday March 16.  I was fortunate to have celebrated their birthdays with them both of which a day before their actual birthday.  Ate Yna and I ate dinner at a local mall but we were suppose to watch a movie that time.  Unfortunately, we weren't able to because she had to work overtime at ther job.  Tito Dodong celebrated his 80th birthday last Saturday at a hotel penthouse.  It's really great.  He doesn't look 80 at all.  He looks like he's only 50.  I really admire that man because he's really a good person.  Despite all the hardships and challenges that were given to him, he never cease to smile.  You never see him not smile even when his daughter and wife died.  He always see the better side of everything.  He never seem to judge and always see the good in people.  He's a good man and I respect him.  Anyway, for the passed few days I have been trying to get my highschool friends together.  Rocky, one of my friends asked for it so I was trying to get them all together.  Here's hoping that I can actually get at least 5 of us together on Friday.  Just yesterday, another friend of mine sent me a very disturbing SMS.  And honestly speaking, even though it seems that she wanted me to side with her, I would actually side with her mother.  This is the gist of the SMS.  She just got home from somewhere and she really wasn't feeling well that time.  Her sister wanted her to accompany her to a children's party at a neighbors house.  She didn't want to because she was tired and wasn't feeling well.  Her mother then intervened and asked her to go, even cried to her just so that she would comply.  Still, she didn't.  This got her mom mad at her.  My friend said that it wasn't fair.  That her mom was siding with her sister for no apparent reason.  She really was upset that night so I just didn't replied to her message.  I just let her rant about it.  But honestly speaking, (and I hope my friend doesn't hate me for saying it) I know where her mother was getting at.  I understand why her mother was insisting her to come despite her not feeling well and all.  And if my friend is reading right now...this is just my point of view.  Feel free to call, SMS or even email me to correct me.  But this is just how I see it from the SMS she sent me.  Anyway, just keep in mind that as Filipinos, it is important to be very close knit.  Family is really a priority to most Filipinos and it really is very painful for a parent when he/she sees that one of their children is slowly moving away...if not physically but emotionally as well.  Here's my two cents worth.  One, our parents have different ways to show us how important we are to them.  I guess that was just one way her mother was showing that she loves her.  Our parents show their love to us in the weirdest way possible.  I guess anger and pleading is one way that her mother was showing how important she is to her.  Two, as I've said before, Filipinos are very close knit.  Once, a family member slowly pulls away from the family, parents tend to panic.  They are afraid that they don't know their children anymore.  It's that fear that drove her mother to insist that she come with her sister to the party.  The fact that my friend leaves early in the morning and goes home late at night.  And when she goes home, she already goes to bed without even getting dinner.  My friend is also very active in different activities.  This even takes up her weekends.  So rather than spending time with her family, she spends it outside doing her activities.  I guess, it's just one way her mom was saying "Give more time to your family."  Family is very important.  It should be one's priority.  Always remember the saying that "Blood is thicker than water".  Friends come and go but your family will always be ther through thick and thin.  With all the hardships that you're experiencing, your family is the best source of strenght.  It's true that there are some friends you can consider family.  I have friends who I can really count on when it really counts but that's only a hand full and you honestly don't know if they do that because they really want to or just for friendship sake.  Family will always be there.  Don't wait for the time that you would regret not being close with your family.  Don't wait until it's too late.  Anyway, if you're wondering whatever happened to Mr. Bee, I never saw him again...I hope...  It turns out that he was trying to make a beehive on my chair.  Honestly speaking, it would have been okay if he made it at the back of the chair and not in the center where I usually sit. When he left to get some "supplies" for his hive, I quickly destroyed what he already made and quickly put acohol on my chair.  When he returned, he was I think wondering where his hive went and when he tried to make it again, he couldn't go down because the chair was wet with alcohol.  But Mr. Bee was smart and he waited for the alcohol to dry and he eventually started to make his hive yet again.  This really got me annoyed so armed with my alcohol, I squirted the bee with it.  It went wild, and flew towards me and then he left never to return again...I hope.  Still I fear that it will come back with reinforcement.  I hope that that would be the last time I would see Mr. Bee.  I don't mind having butterflies decorate my monitor once in a while...even dragonflies look cute but please...NO MORE BUMBLE BEES!!!

       This is Bad   Yesterday when I was on my way home, I was really shocked to see so many people wherever I go, especially in the malls and the MRT.  It was like the population of Metro Manila tripled that day.  I have to let 4 MRTs pass me before I actually got in one.  And there was a 15 minute interval...when it usually takes only 5minutes for the next MRT to arrive.  So, needless to say, when I got out I have to go to the ticketing booth to have my ticket fixed so that they won't give me penalty for the delay they did on the MRT.  Anyway, inside the MRT was much worse.  We were packed like sardines and it's really irritating how some people would still want to come in even if they saw that the place is so packed already, even an ant can't fit in anymore.  But they still keep going in and even get angry if they can't get in.  Aside from that, there are also so many perverts who's taking advantage of the situation.  There was this guy that really irritating.  I was trying to get rid on one of them by trying to squeeze myself between female passengers but this guy kept on following me.  He got what he deserved when I "accidentally" jabbed him hard on the rib when the train stopped abruptly. :D  The downside of everything is, I was on heels yesterday.  Standing for more than 3 hours almost killed my legs that night.  Plus the added fact that I have walked so much that day as well.  I'm very lucky I can still stand today.  I hope later I won't be experiencin the same thing.  I might be wearing sneakers today but still it's really irritating.  When you're already tired from work, all you wanted was to lay back and relax until and when you get home.  These are the days that I regret getting this job.

       The Good, The Bad and the Midget   Yesterday was one of those days that I wanted to scream.  Not only did I work for 12 hours, I have to get here at the same time like yesterday to be the gofer of my boss to her meeting with the President of our country.  Not only am I still sleepy but I still have to so some things for her as well.  Just goes to show that real help is very hard to find and when they find you, they work you to death. :D  Anyway, it isn't all that bad.  I get to see our president face to face and she wasn't all that bad.  At least she's concerned for the environment with all the garbage that is being dumped everyday, it really feels great to know that your leader has a care.  And all my hard work yesterday paid off too. My boss, despite the fact that she works me to death, she really appreciate all the things i do for her.  At least I get appreciated and that is why I like it here despite the work and the distance from my home. :D  My mind is still too tired.  I need at least 6 hours of sleep for my mind to work well.  Till next blog then...

       Good to Finally Meet You   What was suppose to be a tiring day for me ended into something good.  Yesterday, I've finally met a girl in the forum of the Official Kimi Raikkonen site.  Her name is Icegirl (not her real name of course :D).  She was really nice and a very interesting person.  She's still finishing college but has so many things occupying her time and energy that she actually works harder than me. :D (I hope my boss doesn't read this =D)  We talked (well, she did  most of the talking), we agreed at some things and disagree on other topics.  There are also times when topics will be interested for her and not for me and vice versa.  I've finally very happy to have finally met someone outside my family who likes formula 1 like me. Most of my RPG friends don't follow f1 and it's really relief to know that there are people in my country who likes the sport as well not because the players are good looking (though that's one aspect) but because it's really an exciting sport to watch.  To Ice girl, I really hope that that would not be the last time we sat down for coffee. I'm sorry if I might have been boring but I definitely enjoyed my time with you.  And thanks to you, I'm not that eager to by the F1 magazine that has been on my birthday wish list when I saw it last month. =D

       Panic Attack..."Which Way is East?"   This has been one of the most tiring day for me.  I have been running around the office, making phone calls, trying to convince the task force to give me their friggin' report.  I couldn't get in touch with two people in the task force and I really don't know where to get in touch with them.  It's almost five o'clock pm and I really don't know how many will be attending for Wednesday.  Sometimes, working for old people really gets on my nerves.  I don't know how to handle them sometimes.  If I get this wrong, I might end up losing my job.  I feel so dizzy, I don't know where north is anymore... My head is spinning and I really am annoyed by everything.  My work has been moved back and I'm fearing another backlog on my work for the following week or so.  To make matters worse, my computer has not been cooperating with me since this morning.  It hanged three times already and I fear a fourth coming.  I just hope I get through today...

       Highs, Lows and a Congratulations   I’m sorry for not writing something yesterday.  I have been busy with housework, and curing my cold which has become full blown with cough on the side.  It’s not as worse as when I had pneumonia but it’s still awful.  I hate getting the common cold.  It’s irritating and it’s one of those viruses that just doesn’t want to leave quickly.  Anyway, to my low points first.  Aside from my cold, I had the misfortune of having friends who doesn’t care at all.  Try as I might to understand their situation, they just don’t see all the sacrifice that I do for them.  They keep giving you excuses and for the life of me I had enough.  Take for example my friend Rocky.  Last Friday we were suppose to meet to have coffee in Starbucks at Ayala Town Center.  I’ve spent two weeks getting people to come.  I’ve asked, begged even pleading on my knees for them to just drop by for all time sake.  I even told some of my friends that if they are financially not able to get there, I’ll shoulder their expenses.  But still, only four of us came out of the twelve that was suppose to come.  My biggest disappointment was Rocky because he was the reason I spent all those times preparing for the meeting.  A few days before the preparation our friend Lea told me that Rocky was looking forward for our next gimmick together.  I responded by looking for the best date and after confirming from Rocky himself if he will be available on that day, I’ve started making phone calls.  Honestly speaking, if Rocky just told me that he would be available that day, I would have just spend the rest of those two weeks thinking of good stories to write to fanfiction.net instead of convincing my friends to come with us to Starbucks.  I honestly would have understand, I’m not that kind of person who’s narrow minded.  Some of my friends that I’ve called really told me that they would try to make it but still not sure whether they can of not.  I just pleaded so that they would say yes to me even if I would have to pay for their orders just to get them to be there on that day.  Rocky on the other hand told me he will be there, no questions asked.  He may be late but he will be there, so he said.  On the day itself, he didn’t even try to call or send me an SMS to tell me that he couldn’t come (or won’t come as I have a feeling that he did).  Lea had to call him just to find out that he couldn’t come at all.  We were already in Starbucks that time, waiting who would still be coming when Lea called Rocky and gave me the bad news.  That really pissed me off that night.  First of all, I wasn’t feeling well that night.  I lack sleep, I had so many work that morning that I had to cram for the whole day just so that I would be on time to pick up my baby brother Louis from his office to go to Starbucks that night and my cold was becoming worse by the hour I’ve spent working.  I already finished a roll of tissue paper from blowing on my nose.  But I still came because I organized the whole thing and I was hoping to see most of my friends that night.  Secondly, I did it for Rocky.  He asked for a night with his friends and I tried so damn hard to give it to him.  I called him up to say when it was okay, I even confirmed it from him if it was an okay date.  All the hard work I did was all for nothing when it concerned him.  Third, this wasn’t the first time my friends did this to me.  When we were in high school I had organized my events countless times to be disappointed in the end.  One time, I was the only one who was there and none of my friends even tried to call me to tell me that they can’t come.  Fourth, I felt embarrassed to my baby brother who had so many things to do that week and I just begged him to come and being a good baby brother and he really can’t say no to me, he still went that night.  I was really embarrassed to face him when only me, him, Lea and our friend Dean were the only four people who came that night.  We were really hoping there would be more of us.  And lastly, I’ve wasted good money just to call everyone there.  I’ve wasted pre-paid credits so that I could get in touch with my so-called friends to just get them to come last Friday.  At least I know who my real friends are.  That would be the last time, I’m going to organize a get together for my friends.  I not only felt I was being used but I also felt like trash that night.  All my efforts had gone to waste when I saw the usual people getting together.  I felt at my utmost low that night.  I was so humiliated and toyed with that I honestly just want to crawl into a hole that night and stay there for the rest of my existence.  It was really a good thing that my real friends were there that night and made the night fun and interesting despite the lack of numbers.  We even get to see and old high school classmate of ours and got some news about our old batch in high school.  The night wore on looking brighter by the hour making me forget that awful feeling.  We even ended up going to Dean’s house and see the progress that he has done with it.  I applaud my friend Dean for the achievement he’s done so far.  To Dean, thank you for being my friend.  I raise my glass high to toast you of your achievements and being there despite your financial situation.  Same goes to Lea and Louis Dean.  I guess my night would really be really low if it wasn’t for the two of you there.  You gave me a reason to enjoy the night.  And I thank you for that.  A toast to you my friends!  You’re the best!  Needless to say the next day, I didn’t get to play RPG.  Not only I wasn’t allowed because of my cold but I had other things to do as well.  And to make matters worse, Card Captor Sakura didn’t air because the local network were it’s being aired was covering the stupid war!  Yes, I still did not change my stand.  The war is still stupid.  There should have been a better way to change this without bombing and bloodshed but still the stupid US president wouldn’t listen to reason, his people and the Pope.  And honestly speaking rallies wouldn’t help at this stage as well.  Last Friday my aunt was with those rallying people who wants peace.  As much as I myself want peace, I don’t think a rally would let the rulers listen to what you have to say.  You’ll just end up getting literally soaked with water being hosed at you or you get rained at like what happened to my aunt and boss.   The good thing about last Saturday is that at least I got to rest longer.  I got to catch up on my sleep and I feel better already.  I can breathe better and I think my cold is reduced to the sniffles and I’m not coughing that much anymore. &#61514; At least there’s something good.  Let’s just say that it’s getting better everyday. &#61514;  Last Friday I also got praised by my boss for the job I’ve done encoding some materials she will use for a seminar.  It’s really good to hear a praise coming from someone who’s not a family member.  At least you know that it’s not because you’re blood related but because you’ve really done well.  And I have spend the whole day of Thursday just to make that only to repeat it Friday morning because my computer conked up on me.  It was really a refreshing sound to hear a praise instead of scolding from your unbearable aunt. &#61514;  Lastly, a big congratulations to MR. KIMI RAIKKONEN for winning the first place of the Malaysian Grand Prix.  The ICEMAN did it!!! And I’m sure there will be a lot of commotion going in the Official Kimi Raikkonen forum because of it. :D He drove  a good race.  Kept his cool and followed his team.  He wasn’t cocky.  He’s really great and I have new admiration for him.  Again, to the ICEMAN congratulations!!! We at the Forum hope and pray that you get to be World Champion this year. :D  I have another week ahead of me.  And I hope that it will be as wacky as last week. :D

       Another Poem     DARKNESS    I longed to see the light I wanted to feel alive again I longed for that embrace That would take this pain away  Life's all gray for me Nothing but the ash of yesterday I'm drifting Lost and alone in the darkness  I longed to see again The smile of that face The face who took my smile away The face who took my life away  I longed to feel again The warmth of the morning sun The cold water of the rain But I feel nothing because of him  In the darkness I still search Hoping I find my way out And back into his good graces  I longed for him He who took my smile away He who took my life away He who is my smile and my life  I am alone Lost in the darkness Never to find light again Never to see the sun again   -October 17, 2002

       Lonely Days Are Here Again   Yesterday, I just found out that my bestfriend, A.K.A. my baby brother Dean, is moving to Bulacan this May.  Honestly speaking, I am a little sad about the news.  I mean, it took me 5 years to find him again.  After High School, I never saw him at all.  Five years of wondering how he is and what he has been doing those days that we didn't see each other.  And now that I've found him again, it's really good to know that we're still close as before.  If he moves, it would be like those five years all over again.  Among all my few friends in high school, Dean is the one closest to my heart.  Probably because I was his confidant that time.  He tells me everything about his life, his family.  Not only that he was sort of like my protector as well.  He always waits for me when we go home, except when I have choir practice.  He tries to accompany me wherever I go.  He's my "walk for a cause" buddy.  Usually when it was really hard to get a ride when we go home we usually walk that long way from School to SM Southmall.  He admires my older brother.  He's as talented as my brother when it comes to drawing.  I guess you can say that my older brother was his role model in drawing.  He never hides anything from me.  He usually tells me what has been happening to him and ask for my advice in somethings.  If he moves to Bulacan, I would be alone once again when I go home.  Call me a selfish b**ch but those days when we go home together was really great.  If he moves, there would be no more teasing him about his girlfriends and his friends in the office.  It's really sad for me to not experience that again.  My extended family will again be far away from me.  Is it some kind of punishment?  Friends who become really close to me just move away.  Kuya Carl, my childhood friend and whom I consider as one of my bestest bestfriend in the whole world moved back to the US.  He already has a family and just got divorced but he has custody of his kids.  Eversince he left, I felt empty.  Like I said before, we go way back to that time I was still in diapers.  He was with me all my life and when he left my life almost crumbled.  I was so used to him being there for me all the time when he left it was like a block hit me on the head.  He emails me regularly but it's really different from him being here with me.  Same goes with Kuya Jason, my other childhood friend and whom I also consider as my other bestest bestfriend in the whole world.  He died of AIDS.  I can't blame him for leaving.  It's not like he had a choice in the matter.  It was always the three of us together: Carl, Jason and Me.  The three musketeers...we were really close.  We used a nursery rhyme to be our little theme together:  Rubadubdub Two boys and a girl in a tub Who do you think they will be A lawyer, A writer and a medical doctor Want to become as great as they can be.  I wish they didn't leave.  I wish they are still here with me.  I really miss them so much.  As for Dean, it really saddens me to know that when they move, I would rarely see him again...maybe never. :( It's really sad.  I honestly don't know what I'd do when that happens. But at the moment, while he's still lives in Muntinlupa, I'll take every moment I can spend with him to be his best last weeks in the South.  Am I cursed to see friends leave?  Will I always see them move on while I stay where I am?

       Cool Song...   This song is really great to here.  It's actually a love song that is played in rock music.  But it not only talks about love, it also talks about life, challenges and how to face them.  This is from the movie Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture.  The song is very opt for the movie.  I actually have a crush on the main character but honestly speaking, I do not want to be his love interest for fear of dying early. :D    Oh Angel    Oh Angel Come greet the dawn it's a brand new day Oh Angel Live in the passion that fires the soul  Each lonely night I get through without you Becomes my victory Each tempting night I fight against the light That is my destiny  Yet I know that having might don't mean you're right I can't be more cruel and unkind When nothing makes sense I look up at the clouds in the sky They don't answer but I still ask why  Stand tall you won't fall Even a walk in the rain now and then Run into the sun Sharpen your thoughts and your fight can go on  Run your own race Why go for second place Go on and grab a star You can survive, you gotta stay alive Heaven is not that far  When you're on the edge you pledge to live just for today Ain't no steps to the years would pass Look ahead and you'll see that tomorrow has already come Time heals our wounds and our search go on  Stand tall you won't fall Courage is not wolf in hurl stones And you run into the sun Seek out those sums which has not yet been solved  People do fall in love Though they may slam at the table  And oh forevermore I'll learn the flame of your dreams in my soul  Oh Angel Come greet the dawn it's a brand new day Oh Angel Live in the passion that fires the soul...

       A birthday party to remember   Yesterday was a rather memorable day for me.  Not just because it was my birthday but there are somethings that had happened that day related to my special occasion.  One:  I saw my aunt freak out in the  office.  It was a sight to behold.  She was babbling and having tantrums yesterday because some of my bosses didn't get to the office in time.  Dr. Galang our head had to calm her down and kept convincing her that our lunch out will push through.  Two: My parents called my up and I got a chance to talk to them fully before my phone died.  They greeted me on my birthday and I was really very happy.  Three:  I got to use the internet in the office the whole day.  My boss isn't here and still isn't here to use the computer.  It's really great!  Four:  We had a 3hour lunch break.  We ate at around 12nn and practically got back to the office at around 3:30pm.  It's really great.  I ended up nearly not doing much work.  Just faxed some documents and finished typing some documents as well.  But today, I have so much work but it's alright...I still have internet. :D  Five:  We have DSL!!! It was just installed at home late afternoon!  Now the internet at home is pretty fast and I can download things half the time I usually download them. :D  My brothers realy love it very much that now I know that I will have a hard time getting into the internet since they would be using it more often than me and my sister.  Six:  Well, this was this morning but I'm still happy because the Official Kimi Raikkonen Forum members greeted me on my birthday!  It was really a shock since I thought no one will remember from the people there. :D  Anyway, as I've said on my previous blog, it really gets me warm inside to know that I have friends who care so much. :D  Seven:  My bestest best friend in the whole wide world sent me an email greeting me a Happy Birthday and he also sent me and e-card as well.  It was really touching and to get a card from someone whom I haven't seen in the longest time and I still consider the best of the best friends I have was really heart warming.  Kuya Carl and I come way back to the time I was still in diapers.  And to here from him all the way from Boston, I'm really happy.  The biggest news he said to me that he was finally graduating Law at Harvard.  Graduating Law at Harvard is really an achievement and I congratulate him for that. :D  I really had a great time yesterday, even if the MRT was full and I had so many things to carry when I was going home.  I have a different point of view now about the Birthdays.  Anyway, HAPPY APRIL FOOLS!!!! Don't let anybody fool you today! :D

       Something to think about...   Today is my birthday!!!  As early as 2am my mobile phone has been beeping because my parents has greeted me that early a happy birthday.  At around 6am, my friends started to sent me SMS messages as well.  And honestly speaking, it really makes me feel warm inside to know that I have friends who never cease to forget special occasions such as this.  For the passed few weeks I have been down and out lately. Most of the times I have been asking God to take my life already and end this life that I have right now.  Even today, I had asked him to be kind enough to take my life.  But with friends who really cares for you, it really makes you stop to think why you wanted to end your life.  They make life worth living and its really these people who helps you out when you needed them.  I am fortunate to have friends like them. :D  My family is also great!  I wouldn't trade them for the world.  Eversince my parents left the country to work my siblings and I have been closer than before.  It's a blessing in disguise that both my parents are OFWs.  I was thinking that if they never left the country I guess we wouldn't be this close.  And I'm really happy that they are the family that I've got.  Some friends of mine envy me because of the close relationship I have with my siblings.  They usually tend to ask why I'd rather spend my time with my siblings than with them because they rather spend their times outside their homes, going home late at night never sharing a family dinner together.  My answer was plain and simple.  They're family.  We make each other laugh, we tease each other and insult each other without any hard feelings.  We see to it that we have time to sit down and talk to each other about different topics and issues and just plain have fun being around each other.  I guess that's why when I describe my family to my friends they envy me.  They even wonder why I have a picture of my younger brother with me wherever I go. :D  I guess I'm lucky to have siblings like them.  My life isn't dull because of them.  I guess I'm a lucky person to have friends and family who really loves and cares for me. :D  I thank God for that. :D

       Nose Bleed, Dice Set and Why There Should Be Limitations When Playing RPG...   As you can probably see, I haven't written in my blog for 2 days already.  For the passed 2 days I have been busy with work, running around the campus doing errands for my boss and other things that keeps my mind occupied.  For the passed to days, my mind is really taking its toll for holding out all the things that I wanted to write in this blog.  For the passed two days I was planning to write at home but then our internet connection suddenly rallied against us because of one reason or another that we couldn't identify...probably because we're planning to get DSL and will be installed hoping by tomorrow afternoon.  Old internet connection is probably sad because we won't be using her anymore.  Anyway, on to business. Last Friday was the most hectic day of all.  It might even be worse than that MRT experience for me.  I'm saying this because at the end of the day, my nose bled.  My nose never bleeds in any circumstance whether it maybe stress related or because of the heat.  My nose never bled.  Last Friday was the first time it happened and to the shock of my co-employees, I wasn't panicking at all.  Anyway, I was really busy that day.  I was the sound engineer and documentor for the seminar workshop on Solid Waste Management for Schools with Female Presidents.  So while I was manning the sound system, I was also recording everything and trying keep the volume of the speakers, the mic at a level where it won't hurt anybody's ear or loud enough for everyone to hear.  That's not all that was happening.  I was also the gofer (yet again) for the people who needed things to be photo-copied.  I was also one of the point persons you ask about the project.  To top it all off, being the assistant of every single sector of the project (i.e. Barangay, School, Subdivisions, Public Markets, Businesses and Commercial Centers) I have to entertain the head of the Subdivision sector because they were requesting funds for their project for the Subdivisions.  Needless to say I need to be everywhere at one time with no one to help me.  Good thing, I was smart enough to wear sneakers that time.  I wasn't painful for my feet though they were really tired at the end of the day.  When everyone was gone and we were all resting and patting our backs for a job well done, we were in the pantry when it happened.  I didn't even know my nose was bleeding until I touched it. What happened was, we were sitting down at the table eating the left over food from the seminar when I noticed my pants have small red blotches...they weren't that visible but if you took a closer look you will see the blotches.  Out of habit, I usually rub my nose softly to keep it from itching when I say something red in my hand.  This got me more curious for I didn't hold anything red the whole day and the last thing I held was my nose hence, I touched it again and found out that I was bleeding.  My officemates were sort-of panicking telling me different things at the same time.  I just followed what Roadblock of G.I. Joe taught me when I was watching it when I was a kid.  Hold my nose and lean my head forward and not backwards like most people do... It took about 10-15 minutes before the bleeding stop.  It actually scared my aunt and my other boss.  Ms. Tessa, my other boss told me that it might be because I'm a little stressed out because the activities are just overwhelming for me that my body couldn't handle it.  Maybe she's right.  But what really got me what that I bled.  As I've said, I never bleed even when I'm stressed out.  When I get stressed, I hyper-ventilate and pass out but never bleed.  I guess my body doesn't want to hit the ground with no one to catch me. :D  Anyway, so much for that on with the next day.  I was a bit disappoint last Saturday the gremlins weren't there for my advance birthday lunch.  But I guess it's alright since they have a good excuse and all.  But by the end of the day, I really had fun and had a great time nontheless.  The didn't make fun of me, people think that I'm still eighteen even if I will be 23 tomorrow (my real birthday is on March 31) and I get to spend the day listening to stories of people about their RPG experiences.  To top that day off, my friends got me my own dice set with my favorite color too. :D  I was really shocked when my friend Jay brought out that little container that I am now so familiar with and said, "This is from me and Armand...I hope you like it.  We got the opaque one so that you can see the numbers better."  Honestly speaking, I used up all my willpower so that I won't cry in public.  It really almost brought tears to my eyes when I saw it, opened it and tested it...(though at the beginning my dice was saying, "who are you? what are you doing shaking me like that? what makes you think I'm going to give you a good roll?")  It still needs to know who's master, so I wouldn't be shocked if the first tiem I actually use it in a game I would botch one two many times but in the end, I'll break it and they will give me good rolls.  Thanks Jay, Kate and Armand!!! I really love the dice set and I will cherish it for the rest of my life.  I'll even have it bury with me when I grow old and die. :D  Oh, yeah.  When I got home, my siblings also like the dice set.  My older brother being a GM for ADnD for the longest time told me that he now has a dice set to play with if he would go back to GMing DnD. :D My younger brother said that he can play monopoly with just one dice and he can win aleady because one dice roll can take him around the bored. :D  Well, I guess my dice will love my family...They love them already. :D   "Bambi is cartoons...This is real life" - Robi Dy, on Dark Ages: Mage   And lastly, this story was told to me yesterday and I just got to put it in my blog and say something about it... My friends were playing Dark Ages Mage.  Jay was GMing. One of the characters (Robi Dy) was suppose to get a stag to be offered to someone.  He did kill the stag and out of play my friend commented, "You killed, Bambi."  He answered by saying, "Bambi is cartoons...This is real life..."  Honestly speaking, if they were still playing, that wouldn't have sounded funny but it was said out of play. Out of play means that you put aside your character sheets for a while and step back to reality.  You are back in Greenbelt 3 foodcourt (for we usually play there) and you're back to being normal human beings again.  Saying that in out of play means there is something wrong with your sense of reality.  This means, that you've been playing too long.  You need to snap back into reality and be you again.  I wasn't there so I just wrote this down as my point of view.  When you start saying that "Bambi is cartoons...and this is real life..." while you play, you really need to just relax for a while and  get a grip of reality.  You need to look at your surroundings againg and take a break.  When I sometimes associate myself with the characters I play in RPG I know who me is and who Tonnie Seawolf is.  Though most of the time I keep some of myself in the characters I play, there is still something unique about each character I make.  And sometimes, those unique characteristics help me with my day to day activities.  But all this aside, I still see reality and it's difference between RPG.  Anyway, my bro needs the computer so I'm logging off now.

       Another Quiz        You are blue. You are somewhat innocent, in the fact that your genius only extends to the physical world. You have a false sense of contentness. You are usually the quiet one, the genius. Everyone can count on you to help when they have problems, but you only fall short of being able to solve your own.    What inner color are you?           Yet again, Jay and I are the same. :D    urlLink      urlLink Which X/1999 characters are you?   Quiz made by   Chesa     hehe...I'm sweet as pie...(I didn't know pies are sweet?)

       Life's not Fair and the new MRT Station   Yesterday was one of those days that I wanted to scream and throw my computer to the next county.  It hanged in the morning while I was doing some important documents that was needed the next day.  The worst part was when I was about to go home already but the document that was needed the wouldn't save on the disk.  Tried as I might, I couldn't get the document to save even with the multiple diskettes that I armed myself in.  One of the slides was bigger than the total number of bytes that the diskette have so I really couldn't save the document.  As a result, I have to email myself the document (cutting the document into three sections first before emailing it) and fixed it at home so that it would fit.  I sent it twice to every single available email address that I have.  It really sucked because I have to send it twice because one email address wouldn't accept the email because the attachment was so big.  Good thing before the night was over, I had saved everything at home and put it in one CD (thank God we have a CD Burner!)  Then there's this poster incident.  The day before my boss told me to make a poster that was needed to be posted supposedly yesterday afternoon.  I slaved over the computer to make it even pestering my older brother to change the ink of the computer so that i can be finished early.  And yesterday, the person who suppose to get the poster didn't come and take it.  It really annoyed my because I tried so hard to finish it on time just to find out that all your work is wasted since that person didn't show up to retrieve my poster.  Life sucks.  Anyway,  another upsetting thing is that in Formula 1, they might strip Kimi Raikkonen's win and hand it to Gian Carlo Fisichella.  I actually have mixed emotions on this.  Kimi Raikkonen is my favorite driver in F1.  Honestly speaking, I want him to be World Champion in Formula 1.  But as I see it, Fisichella deserve the win as well.  He drove well and when Kimi slipped, he did an amazing overtaking maneuver.  Sad to say that some people doesn't see it that way.  My comrades in the Official Kimi Raikkonen Forum doesn't see it that way as well.  But it's their opinion so I guess it's okay.  But whatever the decision the FIA made, I'll be happy.  With everything that has been happening, there was something good about yesterday.  The new MRT station is finally open.  And though it was a little expensive than the other MRT station (I've spent P12 passing only two stations for the new MRT while the old one I've spent P12.50 which passes eight stations) and the security was so tight (they looked over my bag opening every available zipper and frisk me) it was an amazing experience.  I was like a kid again.  I was in awe when I was riding it.  The station was spacious and air conditioned.  And since it's new, there are only few people using it.  I had a whole chair all to myself.  The train itself was cool.  I feel like I'm in another country because it looked like the subway.  And I can look at both side of the train and I could see the ends, unlike the LRT and the MRT where they have separate "capsules" for the train.  What's really great about it is that the aircon isn't that cold.  Unlike the LRT where there is no aircon at all and the first MRT where the aircon is so cold.  This is just right, not too hot and not too cold.  I guess yesterday wasn't a bad day.  But it would have been the best day if it wasn't for that document incident.

       Peace?   The result of Emodes Original Inkblot Test (http://www.emode.com/tests/inkblot/) gave me the same result as my friend Jay.   Mitch, your unconscious mind is driven most by Peace    You are driven by a higher purpose than most people. You have a deeply-rooted desire to facilitate peacefulness in the world. Whether through subtle interactions with love ones, or through getting involved in social causes, it is important to you to influence the world.  You are driven by a desire to encourage others to think about the positive side of things instead of focusing on the negative. The reason your unconscious is consumed by this might stem from an innate fear of war and turmoil. Thus, to avoid that uncomfortable place for you, your unconscious seeks out the peace in your environment.   Usually, the thing that underlies this unconscious drive is a deep respect for humankind. You care about the future of the world, even beyond your own involvement in it. As a result, your personal integrity acts as a surrogate for your deeper drive toward peace and guides you in daily life towards decisions that are respectful toward yourself and others.   Though your unconscious mind is driven most strongly by Peace, there is much more to who you are at your core.  ---------------------------------------  Kinda makes sense because I really hate violence and war....

       BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!    "If you want to fight the Americans, you will be bombed!" - Harvey Lipshitz, Boston Public "When I think of Patriotism, I think of bombs" - Harvey Lipshitz, Boston Public   I'm back to my topic about war.  As you've seen on the news, US has already taken Baghdad.  News is that they might have already killed Saddam and his sons.  As much as I had Saddam, I still say that it's wrong.  Last Monday when watching Boston Public the issue of terrorism was mentioned.  And Lipshitz took the words right out of my mouth when he said, "I have three words for you.  Boom! Boom! Boom!"  America is a big bully (or the present American president is a big bully).  If they don't want you in the that country, they'll kick you sorry a** and bomb your country until they're satisfied that you don't exist anymore.  Like Lipshitz said, "If you want to fight America, you'll get bomb!"  Big bully.  That what they are at the moment.  People might think that it was the right thing to do but if you look at it in a different way, it's scary.  To think that the US would just wage war against a country because they don't like you is really scary.  If you insult the country or the president of the US, you'll be sorry because you'll get bomb.  What happened to democracy?  What happened to listening to the cries of the people before you make a decision for the people?  As much as I don't like Saddam, I pity the man.  He was only trying to rule his country the way they had been ruling ever since time imemorial.  George W. Bush was only trying to be a big bully since his father failed in capturing the Iraqi president during his reign.  I'll be laughing out loud if they couldn't find him.  I really hope that they couldn't find Saddam and his sons.  If not to make them see how wrong they are for bombing Iraq with all those innocent people stuck in the middle of everything.  Shame on you Bush!  Shame on you!

       GO KIMI!!!   Last Sunday, Kimi Raikkonen won his second podium finish in the Brazilian Grand Prix.  The race was a sight to behold.  The safety car went out 5 times and the race stopped even before the total lap finished.  There were so many highlights but the one that is stuck into my mind are three events that really changed the race.  Though there were so much of those race-changing events, these three was really shocking for me to watch.  Two of which is the retirement of the two Ferrari drivers, Michael Schumacher and Rubens Barrichello.  Michael was aiming for his first win this season (wanting to win his 6th World Championship Title) and Reubens was determined to break his curse of not winning in his home track.  Rubens, after a stunning overtaking maneuver, was already leading to the race.  But after two laps around the grid his car suddenly died yet again ending his race in his home track.  Rubens is not my favorite driver but what I do know is that he deserved to win in his home track even if it would only be that one time.  It has been ten years and he has yet to step on that podium and accept a trophy.  His fans were cheering for him in the stands and it’s really disappointing to see that after that great overtaking maneuver against David Coultard, he wouldn’t be able to finish the race anymore.  His car died and that’s the end of it.    As for Michael, well I guess it’s one bad luck after another.  He has yet to stand on the podium as well and win a trophy.  Last race, he didn’t even finish.  He slipped, skidded and crashed. You rarely see a mistake coming from Michael Schumacher on a wet race.  He’s great on wet weather conditions and seeing him slip and slide was really shocking for me.  I don’t believe that he not at his peak anymore.  It’s not his time to retire either.  But the way he’s been racing well I guess the pressure is so much for him.  I don’t like Michael either but I want to see him at least once in the podium and let Kimi win World Champion this year. J  Another shocking event was the accident of Fernando Alonzo.  Alonzo won third place but suffered what I hope is just a minor injury on the ankle and whip lash due to the crash that he experience after passing through the debris of Mark Webber’s car.  I guess he didn’t see that coming.  Though the yellow flags were already waving because of the massive debris that was caused by the Jaguar, he sped on, hit some debris and went spiraling to the tire wall ending his race.  I hope that he’s all right.  The trophy presentation and press conference was really lacking because he wasn’t there.  And then I was playing the “what-if” game again.  There were so many thing that had happened in that race and all those what-ifs could have change the result of the race.  Like, what if Rubens’ car have no problem, would he have won the race?  What if Michael, Juan Pablo Montoya and Jacque Villenueve didn’t retire, would we have seen them in the podium?  What if Ralph Schumacher and David Coultard didn’t make a pit stop to change tires, would they have won a podium finish?  If Mark Webber didn’t crash, sending Alonzo crashing as well, would we have seen Fisichella on the top of the podium and not Kimi?  I guess Kimi was really lucky that day.  I like Kimi.  He’s the driver I’m cheering for in this race but it really makes me think that if it wasn’t for the things that had happened, would he really won the race?  He’s a good driver and all.  Has shown everyone that he can stop Michael from over-taking.  He has also shown that he can be a competitor on wet weather conditions.  But the circumstances in the race had led him to win first place that day.  So would he have still won if it weren’t for those circumstances?  I am still wondering until now.   But all these aside.  I’m actually happy that he won again.  That means that he’s still leading the driver’s championship and if this goes on, he would be world champion for this season for sure.  Let’s just keep crossing our fingers and hope that he keeps winning podium finishes. J

       A little upset   Today was kind of a disappointing day for me.  I went to our usual Saturday meeting of my RPG friends only to find out that I would be playing boggle the whole time I was there...Oh yeah, I made my dwarf character for Dungeons and Dragons so I guess it was what we term it in Filipino " consuelo ".  Okay, even if I did have fun playing boggle, I was actually hoping I could break in my dice.  Four d6s wasn't my idea of breaking in my dice set.  I guess I'm upset that my friends would actually leave me to be with other people that day as well.  I came there to play RPG with my friends, I ended up baby sitting the gremlins as we play boggle.  I guess I'm still just depressed because my baby brother would be moving to Bulacan in a month's time and I'm still feeling that all my friends are leaving me.  It was really just upsetting that I went there thinking that I would actually enjoy the afternoon with my friends but ended up doing something else that wasn't actually what I was planning to be doing the whole time I was there.  Not that I don't like them making new friends and all but that afternoon, I felt like I was abandoned or something.  Nicco was sulking at a table drawing alone.  Kate was playing something else with some people I don't know.  Jay went for a walk right after he said that I'm finish in making my DnD character (his mind wasn't even there when he was helping me out).  That left me trying to help Robi get over his lost phone, convincing Kevin to actually open his vocabulary and play boggle and keep Reggie interested in playing boggle.  I just try to be open minded and just think that they need to do those things that day.  It helped that when I was going home Jay apologized already.  But at the moment, I'm still upset.  I didn't say anything that time because there were people I don't know and I really don't want to make a scene.  It wasn't right to leave me all alone that way.  It honestly hurt to be shut out the way they had shut me out this afternoon.  I had accepted Jay's apology (don't get me wrong) but it still stung and I need to vent this out before it becomes something that shouldn't be.  As I've said, I think my being upset is due to the fact that I'm feeling that my friends are abandoning me if not physically then most probably emotionally and psychologically.  I don't want to go through what I had experience years ago with my two best friends.  (I might tell you something about that in future blogs but not in this blog)  Tomorrow I will be okay and probably forgotten already what had happened but I need to vent this out before it consumes me.

       Points of Reflection   It's the holy week season and I'm stuck at home with the usual reflection of my life.  I was able to watch this animated movie "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmaron" and it actually made me think about some things.  It's such a nice movie and it's very moving even though its from a point of view of a wild stallion.  The story is about the adventures of a stallion whom a native American named Spirit for this Mustang cannot be broken even if you get every single human being to mount him.  He's a free spirit...I guess that's the reason why this guy named him so.  This Stallion was born and raised in the wild.  When he grew up, he became the leader of their herd and he was a very good leader too.  Everyone respects him and no one challenge his leadership.  He even defeated a panther who was trying to get two colts for his dinner.  He went scampering away when he realize that he couldn't defeat their leader.  But a sudden curiosity led him away from his herd and get captured by men (which he described as the two legged creatures).  These men were soldiers from a cavalry and they try to capture wild horses and break them to use them as their mounts.  Spirit wouldn't have that.  They had cut his hair, added horse shoes to  his feet but with all the harness that they put on him to hold him still, he could not be branded...even if there were 20 men holding him down.  The best part was when they tried to break him.  The head of the fort where he was captured tried everything to break him.  Even letting him starve and thirst for three days.  Spirit led him to believe that he was already broken when he got tired of banging himself all over the coral when the head tried to break him.  The head ended up flying with the saddle on his butt.  Anyway, I can go on and on narrating the whole story but I suggest that you watch it because it's a very touching movie.  You will learn so much about life with that movie.  I like the part where he was freeing every single horse that he encountered that's been broken and used for mounts and haulers of heavy loads.  Even these broken horses have great respect for Spirit.  They look up to him for support and strength much like the way his herd looks up to him.  When he wasn't broken by the head of the calvary, all the horses cheered for him then.  Anyway, watching that movie was truly inspiring.  A born leader and defender of his kind.  He wanted to preserve the beauty of his homeland where he would want to raise his family.  I also admire the horse's sense of loyalty.  His herd waited for him to come back even if it took so long for him to return.  And when he tried to save the Native American, it was really magical.  I had always loved horses.  I guess this movie made me love them more.  All you have to do is look into it's eyes and you can see an old soul in these magnificent beast.

       Cool Song   This song was composed by my older brother but they never get to air it on the radio.  This is such a cool song.    Lonely Journey    Going places thinking of where to go An oddity to me that never fails to show Never thinking that of what lies ahead I’m always in the way of the path that I thread  The deeper I spin the hunter will sin for your ivory skin As I walk to this long road let the lights never dim Down the concrete path I hope you show the way As I hope to return to the warmth of your embrace  Never fearing of what lies ahead Antagonism is always in mind The path that show the way Will never leave me alone Never giving in to the call of surrender Walks this tired and lonely traveler  The stony path I pass a challenge I must face As I venture forth for shelter’s sake As I carry on with a disregard for anything For this will be my long and winding journey  The deeper I spin the hunter will sin for your ivory skin As I walk to this long road let the lights never dim Down the concrete path I hope you show the way As I hope to return to the warmth of your embrace  Thoughts of danger forseen in my eyes Like sharp iron daggers cold as ice The path that shows the way Thoughts of shelter passes The cold of night his only blanket For this tired and lonely traveler  I’m always wandering (4x) Wandering I’m always wandering

       Upsetting Advertisement    ”With all the excitement of the war, we need to be connected to the news.” – Destiny Cable Advertisement   I was watching on E! Philippines and they presented that Super Ferry has cable TV already.  That is a good thing.  Everyone at home was really happy about it because now we can actually watch the things that we wanted to watch even if we’re on a boat going to Negros.  But what really annoyed and upset me was how they advertise that they have satellite broadcasting on the boat.  War isn’t exciting!  War isn’t the kind of thing that we should be watching to have good entertainment!  War isn’t entertaining!  It’s disgusting to think that there are people who see war as a form of entertainment.  There are innocent people who die because of these war.  There are parents who leave their children and are just caught in the middle of it all.  There are children who go off to war to “defend” their country.  And some people actually see this as a form of entertainment.   How could it be entertaining to someone when people die because of a war that shouldn’t have happened?  How can anyone even think that it’s exciting to watch soldiers kill of other soldiers?  Buildings get bombed and destroyed.  Children loses their parents because of panic.  Parents screaming the names of their children who they thought was just right behind them while they run for safety.  And people who are far away from it all are just watching from their TV screens and think that this is entertaining.  Honestly this I ask.  What’s entertaining about seeing people kill other people?  What’s so exciting about soldiers bombing bases where there are also people there just doing their job?  It’s so sickening to think that there are people who see this war as a form of entertainment.  A way for the ratings of their show to move up.  This is really a blow for me that there are people who would actually stoop this low just to sell a product.  It’s really annoying to see some people actually enjoying the carnage.  What has been happening to our world?  I say that we have to think about this.  We are not better than those people killing other people if we actually get entertained by this war.  It’s not right.

       Another Food for thought   Yesterday we had a meeting on the Subdivisions' Sector of the Solid Waste Management project and what I have learned really made me furious, disgusted, and shiver at thought all at the same time.  The reason why our country isn't progressing is because of the people who is running the show.  It's really upsetting to think that people are motivated by money and not the good deeds that they would do to the nation.  What do we have to do to get this country back to being one of the richest country in the world?  We were one of those rich countries.  We still have a chance.  We have rich natural resources.  We should be able to get everything together but we need to get a leader who doesn't care about money but to really serve the country.  I hope that the elections in 2004 would give good results.

       Another Poem   I wrote this when I was a Freshman in college.  I never was good in math.  And I wrote a poem about one of my worse subjects, ALGEBRA.    ALGEBRA    It was last night Or was it this morning When I was confused With, what else? ALGEBRA  I called a friend for help And to get my notebook back But he also couldn't understand The lesson at hand  We started to discuss the problem Finding formulas and solutions So that when we solved each problems After the clock stroke pass twelve  I called him at ten thirty We've finished twelve ten At least even if it's late I finally understand the lesson in ALGE   =July 16, 1997

       Another Day For Tributes   Today my other bestest best friend in the whole wide world, Kuya Jason, should be celebrating his birthday today.  If he was alive today, the would have been 24 years old. Probably on his way to medical school because he always wanted to be a doctor.  These are one of those days that I wish he was here.  If he was alive today, me, him and Kuya Carl would be out eating at a fancy restaurant or watch a movie.  Anyway, here is a poem that I made before when I found out that he died.    Nothing To Fear    Just look south at night Amidst the dark sky you'll see Suddenly his star will shine Outshining the rest in the night sky "Nothing to fear," it said said to me But still I sopped to think Reasons to why He took you already I never felt the same way since Another look at the sky above Now I know I have nothing to fear   =January 24, 1998   There is another thought that came into my mind when I am reminded of the dearly departed of my life...  "Luminous beings we are, not this crude matter." - Yoda, Empire Strikes Back   Yoda usually makes sense to me despite the fact that he speaks weirdly that I do not recommend kids to watch StarWars for fear that they might learn how to speak like him.  Anyway, I think it makes sense.  It makes me feel a lot better about the passing of the people that I love.  I know that they would be here for me.  All I need to do is acknowledge the fact that they are there with me.

       Tribute to Elizabeth Schumacher   I've just recently heard before the race started that Michael and Ralf Schumacher's mother just passed away early this morning before the grand prix in Imola.  It's actually sad to think that the two brothers needed to rush back to the race after their mother died but they have to.  Both Schumacher brothers raced well today.  Despite them lamenting over their mother's death.  Michael was quite sober when he accepted his trophy today.  There wasn't that gleam in his eyes when he usually wins a podium finish.  Anyway, their mother would have been proud at the results.  This is a tribute to Elizabeth Shumacher who died knowing that she raised to wonderful sons.  She would be smiling on them from a above now.  Watching every race.  I salute Michael and Ralf for choosing family first above all else.

       Cross your Fingers   While I was enjoying myself playing RPG with my friends, I got this call from E-telecare telling me that they have scheduled me for the third interview for Recruitment Specialist.  I honestly have never been this excited to get a job that would require me to actually stay in the office almost 24 hours.  I have written in my previous blog entry that I have started to get bored with my present job. I guess with the thought of getting a job near my home and actually do the work that was trully meant for my course made me realize that the present job that I have can actually be done by high school students.  Honestly, I wouldn't have minded the job.  But it really became boring.  I didn't graduate college just to be someone's gofer.  I wanted to use what I have learned in school and I see it in this job that I wanted to get in E-Telecare.  Anyone who will read this, please pray for me so that I will be able to get that job.  And I hope this time I wouldn't be bored with it.

       Another note on War   Well, I know that the war in Iraq is over but eventhough, I still want to put my two cents to it.   Ironic is when we go to war in order that we may have peace.   I found this quote when I was scanning my old notebook filled with it.  They are some quotes that came from different books and a particular radio station that gives “Thought for the day” before they end the program.  That station doesn’t have a thought for the day anymore but I have enough to put on my blog for the next 10 years or so.  Anyway, back to my quote.  This is from “Kurot sa pisngi”.  And it actually makes sense.  It’s like what Master Yoda said before in the Empire Strikes back, “Wars don’t make one great.”  War is war.  I don’t think that we can have peace if we do it by waging war against someone.  It’s just not right.  You may accomplish something like making the other step down and surrender but in the end, they will be loathing you and would be waiting to extract revenge on you.  When they fix their lives and strong enough, they will come back in retaliation.  Vengeance is the only thing that would keep them going.  They would not stop until they have extracted their revenge.  Hence, war will break out yet again.  War will not stop a war.  You cannot have peace even if you wanted to if you start by arming yourself and go to battle.  Let’s take the war in Mindanao.  Why do you think that up to now they still couldn’t stop the Abu Sayaf?  They tell us that they are dwindling in numbers.  They say that in a week’s time there would be no more Abu Sayaf to worry about.  They say that their leader is already dead and that they have scattered.  I say that’s a load of crap.  The leader might be dead but the hearts of the people who were struggling in this war has vengeance in their minds.  They had already lived life in terror and death.  They have seen their loved ones die because of the war that I for one don’t know how it even started.  War is not the answer to have peace.  Didn’t they get that when World War I and II were being done?  Didn’t they just stop and think when the Gulf War occurred or even the Cold War?  And about this war against Iraq?  Now that Saddam is gone, where are the US troops helping the Iraqis start with a new beginning?  Where are the people who wage war against a poor country whom they accused of having weapons of mass destruction?  Where are the weapons of mass destruction that they are saying? I for one haven’t seen it in any of the news.  I haven’t seen any mopping up on the mess they made.  I thought they were going to liberate the Iraqis from the tyrant named Saddam Hussein?  Where are they now? Where is the help they had promised these people?  If this is the peace that they offer, Iraq was better off with Saddam.  I see people in panic.  I see people raiding shops, stores and even hospitals.  The only thing the US liberated was the oil that was very rice in Iraqi soil.  Now that the “tyrant” is gone, they would have no problems accessing the oil there.  You call this peace? I see people still suffering.  There are so many people who need help after the war, where are the people who swore to help them?  This is peace?  What peace did the US give to the Iraqi citizens?  I see more turmoil, more problems even before Saddam’s reign!  Where is the peace you Americans promised when this war started?  Or are we all right that all you wanted was the oil?

       Boredom   For the passed few days I have been down and out.  Bored out of my wits and honestly speaking, even if there is so much work to be done, I kept on postponing them for the next day and the day after that and the day after that.  Until now I want to just sit down, relax and just enjoy being a bum again.  Oh how I miss that day.  Honestly, I really want to work.  There is nothing good than doing a good job.  But for the passed few days…or even weeks, I start to feel the old boredom again.  My sign was when I drag myself out of bed and wishing that it’s the weekend already.   That is not a good thing.  My one weakness.  BOREDOM.  I can do a lot of work and may be able to finish it in a day but when it’s starts becoming a routine, that’s when the boredom kicks in.  I can do a job, simple and easy.  But if I have been doing it over and over and over for the nth time and with nothing changing except for the content of what you’re doing, that’s when I start not having fun.  For me, if the job starts to become boring, I lose my momentum.  Try as I might to make it fun and worthwhile, it seems that it won’t work.  The job that I have right now is fairly easy enough.  I honestly could do the job done in a day, even half a day if because I know I’m that good.  It’s just secretarial work and honestly speaking, it’s really simple to do.  But it’s boring.  Not to mention the people I work with isn’t actually the talkative ones.  Not to mention that I work with my aunt, it’s really annoying.  I wanted to teach (stupid me to find that out when it’s only a month before my graduation).  I guess it would be a job best suited for me because everyday would be something different.  Everyday I get to interact with people and try to make them think of what they are saying.  Everyday, there would be new activities, new lessons to learn and new adventures I can let students face.  It would be something worthwhile to do.  I see myself as a different kind of teacher where I would teach like Robin Williams in “Dead Poet Society” or the teachers I get to watch in “Boston Public” and Michelle Pfeifer in “Dangerous Minds” or even Danny de Vito in “The Renaissance Man”.  Those are the kind of teachers I like to become.  Those are the teachers that I know would actually get the student’s attention and actually start learning.  When that would happen I honestly don’t know.  I wish there was someway I could stop being bored with the life that I have right now.  I honestly don’t want to feel like this anymore.  It’s really pulling me down and I really don’t know what to do.  These are the times I wish I were dead rather than doing this.  I feel like my potential isn’t actually showing and that I’m rotting in a desk that’s filled with ants.  There are so many questions that have been running through my mind.  I honestly can’t think straight.  I’ve been down and out.  There has to be someway I could get my momentum back and not actually get trashed when doing it.  I wish I get a job that I would really like.  A job that I wouldn’t mind growing old in.  I hope and pray that someday, I will be able to get that job.  But in the meantime, I have to live through hell.

       Another Disappointment   After that interview with E-Telecare, I moved on.  Honest...I did.  I was actually planning on getting myself enroled in a language course.  It's either German or Japanese I'm still debating which one.  Finn is another language but I honestly couldn't find a school that teaches Finn. So I guess that's out of the question.  The sad thing though, I couldn't afford it.  Classes will start this coming week and I couldn't even pay for the initial payment of P4,000.00.  Hence, resorting to asking my parents about it.  But they wouldn't give it to me.  I made a mistake in not trying to convince them too much.  My mom told me to just hold on to the idea for a moment and just focus on getting the 18 education units I badly needed to teach.  I made a mistake on not telling them that by the time that school starts for me to get the badly needed 18 education units, I would be through with the begginers course.  It has been one depression after another.  I had always thought that when I am at my lowest, there is nowhere to go but up.  BIG MISTAKE! Somewhere down there, there is still a space where you can go down even farther...and I just took another step down on it.  This morning I was in a verge of tears.  I really wanted to cry already.  But I opted not to and instead indulge myself with 2 huge cotton candy and a small piece of  Cadburry chocolate...not to mention the Mango Ice that Kate and I shared.  That's what I do when I'm depressed, eat to my heart's content.  Though I still keep wondering why even if I have eaten so much (I ate the cotton candy right after my heavy lunch of Sukiyakidon and California Maki), I still haven't gain weight.  Funny thing is, I really doubt that sitting at the foodcourt for 5hours would burn any fat.  I'm still so light, my friend Kristine said that I weigh as much as the bag she carries to school. That would have been a complement to some people but it was really insulting to me.  No offense to Kristine since I know she meant well but I'm not anorexic and I'm not bulimic (sorry for the wrong spelling) but I still haven't gain weight since gradeschool.  I eat a lot.  I eat more than my girl friends.  I can eat as much as the next guy in my circle of friends but still if there is a strong wind, I'll probably fly (though flying is not a bad thing at the moment).  But this is the depression talking and I'm veering out of my topic.  The point that I'm making is that it really hurts.  I don't know why but I thought that getting that language class would help me out of this depression.  It turns out that it would make me more depressed that I was before.  I wanted so much to learn a new language.  I've already fixed my schedule in my mind on how I would actually have the time to take it.  But yet again, disappointment.   I couldn't even blame my parents.  We're in a tight situation at the moment when it comes to money I was already half expecting them to say no but the reason just shocked me.  It wasn't the reason that I was expecting from my mom.  I guess because of that I couldn't get my argument through.  I have to get myself out of this depression.  I really need to see a bright light beyond this dark tunnel (And I don't mean a train).  But I'm still determined to take that class whether or not I get my parents' help.  The problem now is HOW.

       A New Test   The first result was my sister's.  The next one is me. =)    You are Storm!  You are very strong and very protective of those you love.  You are in tune with nature and are very concerned with justice and humanity. Unfortunately, certain apprehensions and fears are very hard for you to overcome, and can often inhibit you when most need to be strong.    urlLink   Which X-Men character are you most like?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     I can't believe that she's Storm.  I thought she would be more like Wolverine.     You are Professor X!  You are a very effective teacher, and you are very committed to those who learn from you.  You put your all into everything you do, to some extent because you fear failure more than anything else.  You are always seeking self-improvement, even in areas where there is nothing you can do to improve.    urlLink   Which X-Men character are you most like?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Eh? When did I became Professor X?  Yet again, Jay and I have the same result...

       Dang! Writer's Block   For the passed few days that I have been working here in the office, during my lunch break and any other break that I create for myself, I started re-writng the very first book that I made which was NINJAS.  Unfortunately, nowadays, even with the basis, I couldn't seem to continue it.  I still haven't finished Chapeter 3.  I haven't posted anything on fictionpress.net either.  I have writer's block again.  It really sucks to know that there is something on your mind that you wanted to bad to let out but can't.  It's really annoying.  I sometimes think that it's because of the depression that I have right now but there are some instances that I can't think as well even if I'm all happy and devoid of any problems.  I really hate this.  I honestly would love to finish the Ninjas story so that I can move on to rewriting the next Ninjas book.  I think I going to calm my mind now. =) 'Til next blog. =D

       Better Luck Next Time   As much as I told myself that I wasn't going to expect the call yesterday, I saw myself looking at my celphone every now and then for that unfamiliar number that would be flashed on the small screen of my celphone and someone from the other line would tell me to resign in this present job and join them in Makati.  But of course, the call never came.  I was really disappointed.  I feel so down and out but I keep saying to myself that "At least I still have a job."  I still get to keep the job that would require me to travel 6hours back and forth.  I still get to keep the job where the building has no aircon.  I still get to keep the job where I am being attack by ants, bees, spiders and whatever insects that crawls, flies and make weird sounds.  I still get to keep the job where I get to see my very annoying aunt who still treats me like a 7 year old.  I still get to keep the job where I get to get my salary when someone actually signs my check or else I won't get one at all.  I still get to keep the job that is boring me to death.  On a lighter side of life, I still try to see the good points this job has to offer.  One, it's a job.  It's better than being a bum.  Two, I have internet access, even if sometimes the connection is all screwed up.  Three, there are still some good insects that come and make it a good day for me.  Butterflies come in the office everyday and decorate my monitor. =)  Four, I get to eat anytime I want. Five, I get to eat at my desk. Six, when our boss treats us for lunch, we have a three hour lunch period.  Seven, no one bothers me when I'm at work.  They just forget that I exist except when they need something from me.  Eight, I can use the CD Rom for a CD player, though I have to bring my own earphones for it.  Nine, I get to use the pettycash money that I'm keeping provided no one knows and I pay it back when I get my salary. And Ten, I only get to work Mondays to Fridays.  I still get to play RPG on Saturdays and be with my family on Sundays.  I guess, I have to think about the bright side of it.  I might be so tired by the end of the day, but I still have to be thankful that I get paid for the hard work that I do.

       Something To Think About    Pain was not to be rejected, but embraced.  As I see it, the only true constant in reality was pain.   Birth was pain, death was pain, all change require pain.  To reject pain was to deny the very nature of the universe.  Personal weakness distanced people from pain, which was not the worked past, but woven through one so a being could become transcendent and be transfigured into the very likeness of the gods themselves.    I based the personality of Tonnie Seawolf with this saying.  Being a masochist, pain is the thing that keeps her alive.  It’s her teacher as she lives her life in the world.  I remembered Tonnie discussing this with her avatar, Baron Semedi.  And that was a very interesting discussion indeed.  When you see a teenage girl talking to a skeleton whose wearing a top hat and a cape, no you’re not crazy. You’ve just awaken your powers as a mage and you have the power to see someone’s avatar.  Tonnie Seawolf is my favorite RPG character that I had created.  Her story mostly revolved on pain.  She has suffered from physical pain but mostly emotional and psychological pain.  If they honestly have placed her on pychiatric help the psychiatrist will have a field day.  For all she has been through, I’m sure these psychiatrists will have a hard time figuring her out.  Tonnie is in the verge of a breakdown almost going near the psychotic.  But she’s still a person who knows how to love (she did get married and have a son) and have fun (she used to go to bar when she was a teenager) and be loyal to her friends (she’s following two of them right now to Creation).  She was the only one who survived a car crash killing her parents, leaving her to live with her grandparents.  That trauma caused her to see pain in a different light.  When her parents died, she started to think that pain is a way to learn something the easiest way.  If you have not experience pain, then you haven’t learned anything at all.  Pain helps her to think clearly.  The time when she was awaken as a mage, she saw her grandparents hanging on the wall, crucified.  Alone in the world, she survived by pain.  Learning everything she needed to learn while all the while getting hurt in the process.  She has suffered so much that pain is already second nature to her.  She lives in pain.  Enjoys the hurt.  Welcomes the devastation and chaos of suffering.  But with everything that has happened.  She saw a new point of view.  Hurting people for the sake of just hurting them isn’t what a dreamspeaker should be doing.  Spirits are around us all the time and they also need protection.  Tonnie lives to protect these spirits.  She vows to keep them safe from all the evil they will encounter as lost souls and spirits.  Because just because you’re spirit it doesn’t mean that you won’t get hurt anymore.  On the contrary, spirits are more fragile than the human body because if the spirit is hurt, you won’t be able to heal it anymore.  Being a spirit, you won’t have a chance to save yourself if you get destroyed by the order of reason.  Tonnie protects the living while getting hurt in the process of helping them.  Pain is a way to learn.  Take it from Tonnie.  She has experience so much pain that she has become pain itself.  So if I were you, think about it.  getting hurt isn’t all that bad.  Tonnie has suffered more than you.  Think that if this is real life, you won’t be able to survive what Tonnie has been through.  Do not resist pain, you should embrace it or you will not be able to acknowledge how wonderful life is.

       Disappointed With Myself   I blew it!  I blew the interview!  I saw in the interviewer's eyes that I won't be getting the job.  I'm very disappointed with myself. I feel like I'm so stupid I couldn't even talk properly.  I felt like I was Kimi Raikkonen when he rammed into Antonio Pizzonia last Sunday during the race.  He didn't even get to start.  I didn't start properly and I ended up banging on the wall.  At the beginning of the interview I started to stutter and blabber.  I didn't even know what I was saying.  I thought I got it.  Dang! It's the third interview and I blew it.  I won't be expecting their call tomorrow.  I wouldn't get my hopes up with the blunder I did last night.  It was truly disappointing.  I hate myself for acting so stupid yesterday.  And I was actually looking forward to working in the Makati area.  At least it would only take around 2hours going to and from work...not the 6hours I'm experiencing now.  Oh well.  At least I still have a job.  The most boring job in the world but at least I get paid for it.  If God has a plan for me, so be it.  I won't argue anymore.

       A Very Disappointing Race   Last night, I have the misfortune of watching my favorite driver Kimi Raikkonen not finish a race for the first time this season.  He not only did not finish but he barely started as well.  I guess my brother was right about last Saturday being a sign of a bad race for him.  At Saturday qualifying, his car twitched and he ended up driving through the gravel damaging the bottom of his car which made him go back to the pits and not set a time.  He was starting the race on the last place on the grid.  The next day, he did even worse by ramming in front of a stationary Jaguar of Antonio Pizzonia, endind both their race before they even get started. =(  Very dissapointing indeed.  I was hoping to see fireworks last night knowing that the new Ferrari car was being used to race.  It would have been great to see the battle of the old Mclaren car race against the new Ferrari.  But alas, it didn't happened.  Guess I'll have to wait for the next race to see. =(  I was sad when I saw Kimi in the pits.  His body language said it all.  Even if his face was devoid of emotions (though I didn't actually see that since he was still wearing a helmet) you could still see by the way that he stood there that he was indeed disapointed.  He could have won a podium finish.  He could still have a big lead against Michael Schumacher not the 4 point lead that he has right now.  Disappointing.  Very disappointing indeed.  I really hope the next race would be better.  I hope in the next race, I get to see Kimi leading and winning podium. Hohum...there would still be a next time.

       Matrix Reloaded   Last night, I got a chance to watch the premiere of Matrix Reloaded.  What can I say, it was really an amazing movie effects, stunts and fighting scene wise.  As I've said, the fighting scene was the best part of everything!  It was really well coreographed.  I especially like the fight between Neo and a hundred or so Mr. Smith.  It was really amazing. The fight of Morpheus and another agent was also spectacular, only because the fight was done on a moving truck.  It was really great seeing the agent and Morpheus try to push each other out of the truck.  The car chase was also great.  There were a lot of cars flying and being blasted out of the way.  The car where Trinity was driving ended up like a holed cheese.  It was amazing how it kept on running until the last.  The dialogue was a little weird and funny though.  Being a Behavioral Science graduate, I saw the movie in the eye of a psychologist since they talk about deviants and anomalies which you usually try to discuss in a psychology class.  I would actually recommend this movie to a psychology class for the students to watch and understand about deviants, minorities, and prejudices.  It's really informative.  But the ending was a tad disappointing.  But you have to watch the movie to find out why.  It won't be right if I wrote it here.  Though that's the only thing I'm disappointed about.  The whole movie was honestly worth the wait.  And even if I had just 2 hours of sleep I would do it again if the movie was as good as this. =)

       Sayings from the Wise    Life is dangerous.  Just stepping out the door is dangerous.  You cannot hide from danger.  Death floats on the air, creeps through the window, comes with the handshake of a stranger.  If we stop living because we fear death, then we have already died.  -Raistlin at age 21, Soulforge    Interesting.  It makes sense as well.  I guess that's the reason why there are so many people who drink and smoke too much.  It's not about fearing death but living a life before Big G takes you back.  If you think about it.  There are so many people who fears death so much that they are so afraid of stepping out of the safety of their homes.  I guess this is one of the reasons why I like Raistlin very much of all the characters of Dragonlance that I am familiar with.  I can relate to all the pain and suffering that he has gone through because of his frail body and constant sickness.  But he never stopped achieving and reaching for his goals.  He never stopped dreaming to be the best that he can be even though he ended up turning evil because of his ambition.  Like him, I've suffered much mistreatment because of my weak health.  I have been the topic of discussion concerning unhealthy people.  When I was a kid, I would always be absent for about a week every month.  But that did not stop me from getting where I am right now.  Even with my weak health I tend to do more than what I can normally do to achieve my goals.  Raistlin was right.  If you just stay indoors because you fear death, you have already died.  If you stop living, then why do you want to keep breathing?  Life is good! Even if there are so many problems that you are facing.  Even if you have some difficulty in life, just be thankful that you're living it.  Just remember that you need to see both the bad and the good in life.  Gettin sick means that you feel fatigue, hurting your finger means that you feel pain.  These are wonderful feelings and you should welcome them like you welcome falling in love and enjoying the company of your friends.  Live.  Make your life worth something.

       Late To Bed, Early To Rise   Eversince I got this job, the maximun hours of sleep I get is 5 hours and I would be lucky if that happens.  Most of the time, it would be three hours.  Sleep, the luxury that I could not afford since I've started working all the way up north.  Life treats me fine though since this job isn't as hard...as I've said before, even a high school student could do this job for me.  Today, we were ordered by our boss to come to the office a little early since there would be important guest that would go here and see what's going on.  Last night was the start of the second season of Alias in Studio 23 which was 2 hours long.  Hence, I slept at 1 o'clock.  I have to wake up at 4am to get to the office early to fix my table.  Yes, I admit that it's sometimes if not most of the time that it's my fault that I sleep late.  But it's the only time I actually get to spend time with my siblings during the weekdays.  It's a family thing and it's very important to me.  Anyway, I chose this life so I have to bear with it.  There might be some good coming out of this.  And I hope it would come out soon.

       When You Want Something Done, Don’t Use My Computer   Again, work related.  I honestly don’t know what’s wrong.  I honestly would think that if my computer was a person, he would be happy that I’ve put a Norton Anti-Virus when in fact before, there was none installed.  I honestly think that if my computer was a person he would be thankful that I clean it up everyday.  I make sure that no dust or dirt would stay and dirty my keyboard.  If my computer was a person, he should be thankful that I don’t use him for complicated things such as dismantling it to see what’s wrong.  But honestly, I was hoping that my computer would like me.  If it was a person, I would have killed him by now because it annoys me to the brink of insanity.  Numerous times have I been using the PC to do my job.  Numerous times have I tried to finish up my reports so that for once I would be scolded for slacking off.  Numerous times have I tried to be nice to it.  Even talking to it when I open it up so that it would have a good day and at least give me a good day as well.  But it would never happen.  Whoever the original owner of this PC has some kind of fail safe device that would hurt the reputation of the next person who will be using this machine.  Whoever the original owner of this computer is, the PC loved him so much that any other users would really have a hard time doing their work.  Eversince I’ve got this PC, things has gone down hill from there.  This PC doesn’t like me at all.  It hangs all the time, it erases some important files that I have not yet brought to the recycling bin, it f@#ks up everytime I really need it’s help.  I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve this.  I get crap from my boss all the time and letting the computer add to the aggravation that I am feeling is just too much.  There was a time when I needed to finish something important and I really need it before the day is through.  Good ol’ computer has some tricks up his sleeves again.  It hanged twice and that day it would let me save the document when I finally got trough making it.  To make matters worse, when I tried restarting it, it won’t.  The computer’s possessed I tell you!  Possessed!!!  I don’t know what I had done to deserve such a treatment from a machine that I have honestly trying to take good care at but I don’t think it really likes me that much.  I really hate it everytime it hangs when I’m about to save my work.  Honestly, if it had done that once, I could understand but doing it to me a billion times is already too much to handle.  I honestly don’t know what I had done to deserve such a treatment by a machine. It’s really annoying.  When you want something done, I wouldn’t suggest my computer to you because it will hang and probably crash before you could save your work.

       And My Depression is Building...So Is My Anxiety   People in this office seem to think me as marble.  No feeling whatsoever.  The things I do just to keep this job.  I am in a verge of a nervous breakdown.  I don’t think I can handle this any longer.  I don’t even think I will last until the end of the month.  I want to scream.  But I don’t think that’s possible.  One thing because the place isn’t air-conditioned people will hear me outside of the building.  Hohum…I’m really depressed.  But now I’m a little anxious.  I honestly don’t like those feelings.  Anxiety and depression.  Signs of stress.  You might be wondering why do I have anxiety attacks and depression attacks today.  It’s mostly due to the fact that I saw that my boss got to the documents that need to be signed that I made.  I’m honestly thinking whether she would again scold me because of my English.  I can’t take another insult.  I don’t want to blow at her for all this anxiety panics that I am having.  But it’s building and it’s really scary.  I’m so afraid of what she might tell me if I go in her office and discuss about the documents.  The pressure is building and I can’t handle it.  I don’t know what she would be telling me.  I am afraid to know as well.  I am so scared.  I might even get fired today.  My aunt can’t help me here.  I am scared.  I’m really scared.  I’m not ready to lose this job.

       I Can’t Do This Sam   Frodo’s immortal words in Lord of the Rings: Two Tower.  It’s what I’m feeling at the moment.  It’s what my body and mind have been screaming ever since I’ve been working at this ant infested office.  I can’t do this. This is too much for me to do.  I have been feeling like this ever since I’ve started working.  But yesterday was the only time that it really sunk in and my body has started to feel the pressure.  It’s already enough that I get crap from my aunt, but to get it from my boss as well, it’s too much to handle anymore.  One mistake was all it took.  One mistake for someone to brand you something negative and it will stick to his/her mind for the rest of your days.  And it all started with that accounting thing that my boss wanted me to do.  I couldn’t do it on time because I honestly don’t know what to do with it.  I suck at accounting.   I can ask people about it but I still wouldn’t understand a thing.  My one flaw in academics, anything to do with money and math, I suck big time.  That one flaw, that one mistake  that took me forever to fix.  It was engraved in the mind of my boss and now, nothing pleases her.  All the things I do however I thought that it was well planned and initiated, however I thought that I was well written, she would find something that would make her frustrated and scold me.  Yesterday was the biggest blow that I had accepted silently.  But inside I was screaming.  I honestly wanted to cry my heart out because of all the insults that was aimed at me yesterday was the biggest insult I had heard about me.  She told me that my English sucked big time.  Biggest blow.  As I’ve said to my friend Jay when I texted him what happened.  I could accept it when she told me I wasn’t using my common sense.  I have to admit, I have the lowest common sense among my siblings.  I admit to the fact that all the knowledge I have are based on reading and watching but in real life, I have so many things to learn still.  I admit that yes, I do not use my common sense much.  I don’t even think I have that much.  I admit to that fact.  So yes, I could be stupid at times.  But to tell me that I can’t write in proper English was the biggest insult anyone could give me.  I have prided myself for more or less mastering speaking and writing English.  Heck! I could even speak with a British accent without any problems!  So hearing my boss said that to me was a blow in the face.  It was something I wasn’t expecting her to say to me.  It really hurt.  I came back to my desk yesterday almost on the verge of tears but I hold it up because I do not want to give her the satisfaction that she had hurt me.  I wouldn’t want to give her that thought that I was so hurt that I wanted to tear her throat out. I didn’t want her to see me already at my lowest.  I want her to see that I wasn’t affected by what she said to me.  I want her to see that I am strong and can handle any insult she would give me.  I held back the tears, not giving anyone the satisfaction of seeing me at my lowest.  But inside I was screaming.  Inside I wanted to crawl to the darkest part of the cave and stay there.  I want to just wilt away and die.  I don’t want to do this anymore.  I want out.  “I can’t do this, Sam.”  Frodo has said that to Sam when he was on the verge of turning evil because of the ring.  But Sam was there for Frodo.  Urging him on so that he wouldn’t give up.  Staying with him until he has completed the mission.  I don’t have a “Sam” in my life.  I don’t have anyone to urge me to finish my mission.  The closest person to a “Sam” that I have is in Boston finishing up law in Harvard.  He’s not here to urge me on, tell me that everything will be alright.  Tell me that nothing will go wrong because he’s my Sam.  All he could do is to just be there in spirit.  But I need him physically more than just giving me moral support via email.  I don’t have a Sam in my life.  I’m all alone in this unknown land going deeper and deeper into the forest without a compass.  Lost and all alone, I trudge to my doom.  Waiting to breathe my last breath.  All because my Sam isn’t here.  My boss told me yesterday that if I don’t shape up, she might end up looking for someone else.  I hope that before that happens, I will get another job.  I don’t want to be a bum again.  The thought of staying at home is a good idea but I have bills to pay.  Honestly, I’m just waiting to be called by my boss telling me that I only have a month to work here anymore.  I guess it’s for the better.  I mean, the only reason I got this job was because I’m so desperate to take any job that was offered to me.  But I’m still hoping that God would be kind enough to bless me with another job before I lose this one.  “I can’t do this Sam.”  I’m tired of everything.  I drag myself out of bed every morning for what?  Get scolded because my sentence construction isn’t how she wanted.  I have chest pains every other day.  A new record for me.  The last time was once every two weeks now it’s every other day.  This job would be the death of me, that I’m sure.  “I can’t do this Sam.”  The task that I must fulfill is very perilous.  And I have no one I can turn to for support.  I need a Sam.  It’s alright if he isn’t a gardener and doesn’t have a Scottish accent.  I just need someone who would be there and talk.  Someone who would hold me, give me a tight hug while I cry on his shoulders.  Someone I wouldn’t see having a romantic relationship with but close enough for people to think that we are.  Someone who I can be at ease with. So by the end of the day, we would laugh about this.  Where are you Sam?  I need you.

       It Keeps Getting Worse    Honestly speaking, if I don’t get a new job sometime before June, I swear I’m going to burst!  I don’t know how long I will take this.  It’s not anymore because it’s really far from home, it’s the realization that I’m not happy anymore.  People who keeps working just because of the money even though they really don’t like the job I honestly have great respect.  I honestly couldn’t handle that.  I need a job I would like and I would end up retiring to even though the pay’s not good.  At least I know I enjoyed every moment of it.  Sometimes I wonder what would have happened to me if I took the admin assistant job in Abbot.  Would I also regret it the way I’m regretting it right now?  The reason why I chose this job over Abbot is because the job in Abbot was only for a month.  It still wasn’t sure whether I would be extended or not.  Now I’m actually thinking whether I should have gotten that job instead of this job that I have right now.  It’s not that the job is hard but I hate making phone calls, there’s no pleasing my boss.  My job is clerical work most of the time but still she insist that it’s an assistant’s job.  When I try to make the initiative, she tells me to let know first.  If I don’t make the initiative, she tells me that I need to have initiative to work even when she’s not looking.  I am so confused right now that I don’t know what to do.  I used to say that I want to complete my contract here.  I want to finish it so that it would be good on my resume.  At least, that would be another good point in my resume.  I only lasted a month in Citibank, my first real job after I graduate.  My two year contract with ING Life was more or less non-existent because it’s a commission based job so I guess it doesn’t count.  I got retrenched in Asian Call Centres, which was a big regret because I was really getting the hang of things and I was promised a position in the operations already. Besides, our bosses there are really nice people.  We can actually go to them for help and everything.  I honestly wonder why I ended up here.  No one pays attention to me.  Nobody takes me seriously.  I hate making phone calls because I end up being humiliated all the time.  I was promised that I will go out to take photographs but it’s been six months already and I still yet to go out for that assignment…  Wow, train of thoughts does help me in realizing things.  I know the reason why now.  I was promised that I would go out once a month to take photographs.  That got me interested in the job.  But as I’ve said, it has already been six months and I’m stuck here, sharing the internet with my boss and getting scold at one after another because of very contradicting things.  Honestly I wouldn’t mind the distance if it’s honestly worthwhile to do.  I see myself dragging out of bed, forcing myself to go to the office to get the job done.  But I see myself slacking off as much as possible (I’m slacking off as I type this).  Why can’t I get a job that was like Kids At Work.  That job was really great.  I regretted ending my contract there.  The people were wonderful, and I enjoyed every moment of it.  I wake up each morning excited, like I’m excited every Saturday for a good RPG game.  I go there even if I’m not on duty.  I kept on asking for a schedule even if it’s already fixed.  I want to feel that again.  I want to experience that excitement.  I want to wake up eager to go to the office and anticipate another exciting day.  Hohum…looks like I’ll be stuck here, if I don’t get fired before that.  What can I say, life’s a bitch!

       And I Thought Things Won't Get Any Worse Than This   With all the bad luck happening in my life these days, I had always thought that I would get to the bottom already.  Yet again, my theory is flawed.  I could get lower tham where I am today.  My wallet was stolen this morning.  With it goes everything that I can possibly hold dear and important in my everyday life.  With it goes my latest salary, my atm and credit card, my timezone card that still has credits, 2 MRT value cards (1 for the edsa MRT and 1 for the Aurora Boulevard MRT), my phone card that I haven't gotten to use yet, my Draco Malfoy coin that I treasure very much and pictures of my boyfriend and close friends not to mention the Kimi Raikkonen calendar that I got from my Japanese Penpal. =(  So now, I really don't believe in the saying that, "When you're at your lowest, there's no place to go but up."  As I've said on my past blog, there would still be this small space that would get you even lower than what you thought was your lowest.  When will I ever see the light out of this dark tunnel?  I must have been walking the wrong way because I think I've been going deeper and deeper in the darkness.  Still I wonder, when will I be able to see again?

       Alone Again   This is a type of day that I really like so much...alone in the office with no one to tell me that my English suck. =)  Everyone in the office today had gone out leaving me handling everything from answering phone calls to getting the messages from people coming in to inquire about the services of the office.  It's really a nice feeling that I'm alone.  It's honestly a contrast of my personality in which I really like a lot of people around me so that I get to talk with them about their day or their problems.  I guess in this office, I'd rather be alone. =)  It's really relaxing too. =)  Anyway, I have been writing again about Tonnie's story. I might be posting it sometime this week if I have the time.  =)  That has been a project of mine since I was in college.  I was hoping I get to publish it into a real book if I could honestly get White Wolf to publish it for me since it is based on their RPG game.  Hohum...some dreams aren't meant to come true.  But if I stop dreaming then I know that it will never come true.  If I keep on hoping then maybe there would be a glimmer of hope that I might be blessed.  Lolling in the serenity in the office.  I guess that I really need the peace and quiet to get my creative juices to work again. How I wish that it would be enough to publish even just one book. =)

       Just a thought   Well, after all my ranting and ravings against my present job, I have to stop and do something about it now.  At the moment, I am presently job hunting for any type of job that would be suited for me.  I don't really care at the moment if it's just a job as a receptionist or a bank teller, just as long as I get to work closer to home.  There's a typhoon in the Philippines at the moment and going to work is really hard to do if you're coming from the other side of Metro Manila.  I almost got stranded today just getting back home.  Hohum...I really need to get out of that place.  I don't see myself growing.  I am staying still, not improving whatsoever. Something must be done, and it has to be done fast.

       Another Song   Here’s another old song that I just heard again yesterday.  It’s a depressing song if you try to understand the lyrics but I guess it’s a timely song for me.   Tears of The Dragon   For too long now There were secrets in my mind For too long now There were things I should have said  In the darkness I was stumbling for the door To find the reason To find the time, the place the hour  Waiting for the winter sun And the cold light of day The misty ghost of childhood fears The pressure is building And I can’t stay away   Chorus:  I throw myself into the sea  Release the wave Let it wash over me To face the fear I once believed The tears of the dragon, for you and for me  From where I was I have wings I couldn’t fly From where I was I had tears I couldn’t cry  My emotions Frozen in an icy lake I couldn’t feel them  Until the ice began to break  I have no power over this You know I’m afraid The walls I build are crumbling The water is moving And I’m slipping away (Repeat Chorus) Slowly I awake Slowly I rise The walls I built are crumbling The water is moving And I’m slipping away (Repeat Chorus 2x)

       The Return Of Mr. Bee   I had actually thought I got rid of him.  I had actually thought that I won’t be seeing him flying around near my chair claiming it for its own to make a hive.  Unfortunately, it’s back with a vengeance.  It’s flying again one more time looking for a hive.  I honestly have to squirt him again with my trusty alcohol yesterday and today.  If this goes on, I wouldn’t be able to work well because I have to look to my left and right just to check if he’s coming to ruin my morning.  Mr. Bee is making my decision to leave this office much easier.  But I still have to look somewhere else before I could actually push through with it.  Honestly, this office environment where I am right now isn’t conducive to me.  Now, not only will I be battling Mr. Bumblebee, I also have to put up with Mrs. Mosquito and Commander Ant with his battalion.    I have bite marks all over my body.  I can’t concentrate on working because of all these insects that’s coming in and out of my life.  I feel that by the end of the month, I will be nothing but a hollow shell because these mosquitoes already suck all the blood out of me.  It’s really not right.  I can’t get any peace of mind.  Honestly, I really need to be able to concentrate on working if I wanted to be stuck here and finish my contract.  With all the distractions that is the office I really don’t see myself doing a good job even if the job is clerical work.  If my life wouldn’t get any better  by the end of the month, I would have to take drastic action.  I can’t stand it here anymore and it’s not even about my boss.  I might get malaria, or dengue or even typhoid fever because of these insects that’s trying to make my desk as their homes.  I could actually start an ecosystem here already if I’m not careful.  I have made a decision.  Later this evening I would be going to this meeting of people being asked to edit some document.  Honestly, I am hoping that the job would take longer than a month to do, that way I could resign in this job but still be able to afford looking for a job and going out with my friends even though I don’t have a real job anymore.  I hope that job would keep going until I actually get hired by a company that’s near my house so that I would actually sleep longer.  Anyway, the return of Mr. Bee got me thinking of what’s been happening to my life and I feel that I’m wasting it all away just because I keep on staying here.  I need a change and fast.  Anyway, thank you Mr. Bee.  I guess you helped me out this time. =)

       I Almost Got Arrested   I had the most scary yet amazing time today.  I was almost arrested by the traffic investigators just because I was trying to save the trees.  Honestly, I was scared.  But I have to make a stand at one point otherwise they would just continue to just kill all of them.  It was a choice that I have to make.  And despite the fact that I almost got arrested, I stood my ground.  I know it was the most stupid course of action that I had done all my life.  But that stupid action caused these hired workers to stop what they are doing for at least a few hours.  Unfortunately my brilliant plan didn't work out so well.  As I type this they have continued on working in destroying the island that "house" the trees.  Those tree killers are at it again and the people who were planning to arrest me are already laughing their heads off.  My aunt was with me and for fear that I might get arrested (because I'm already being threatened by the traffic investigators) she volunteered to be arrested in my place.  Honestly, as much as she annoys me to death, I don't want her arrested because of what I did.  I honestly wanted to get arrested but she wouldn't let me.  I guess it was alright considering that if I actually get a police record, it would give me a hard time getting a better job than this.  At least this would save my parents from being humiliated because their youngest daughter was obstructing traffic by sitting at one of the demolition equipment.  Sometimes I wished I could have stayed there.  I should not have gone down.  I should just have gotten myself arrested and made my stand.  But my fear for my aunt hindered me to do so.  And now, I feel awful. =(  The tree killers won.  And I hate myself for it.

       I Don’t Want To Say Goodbye   With all the problems I have right now, I didn’t pay much attention to it anymore when I found out that my best friend was in worst shape than me.  I put it all aside just so that I would be able to be with her.  I can’t accept it.  It’s just not fair that an angel like her would be suffering so much.  And I just can’t let go.  I know that she’s gotten worse when I saw her last Christmas.  I know years before that she has leukemia.  I also know that after a few years after we all found out that her body wouldn’t respond to the medications anymore.  She was trying her best to keep on living.  Sheer willpower was the only thing that’s keeping her alive and some other medicines prolonging the inevitable.  And that Christmas, the revelation that she told me made me sort out my priorities right then and there.  I knew that she needed me again like she needed me before when we were kids.  It was the Christmas season, Jenny arrived at the house of the family of my soon to be ex-wife.  I was staying there with her family and I guess even if the saying goes that “blood is thicker than water” in my case, the family of Tina (my wife) wanted me to stay with them.  They told me that I was more a family to them than Tina ever was.  Anyway, when Jenny arrived, I saw the drastic change in her.  She was pale as the moon and I could see small circles forming in her eyes.  She was still as cheerful as ever but I could see the effort that she was doing just to keep that smile and that energy.  But that time I was still oblivious to everything because I have other things running in my mind that I thought it was just the lighting in the room.  I was going to tell her about my plans in divorcing my wife and I needed her support.  But as I’ve said, my priorities changed after.  Her boyfriend, who was the cousin of my wife, went to her and gave her a warm welcome.  The whole family was there at the moment playing a board game.  They all stopped and welcomed Jenny when her boyfriend was ready to share her with the rest of us.  She brought gifts for my two kids, her goddaughter and the rest of the family.  But I can see that she was trying hard to make it look like she wasn’t having trouble at all.  Finally I was able to get close to her and gave her my greetings for the holiday season.  We gave each other a warm hug and proceeded with the greetings and welcomes.  When we finally let go of each other, that was when I noticed that it wasn’t the lighting that gave her the pale skin.  She was really pale and sickly.  “You’re so pale, Jen,” I said.  “I prefer to be called porcelain skinned,” she replied with a smile, her voice teasing.  Much like those days when we were still kids.  “Either way, there’s something wrong,” I answered.  “What wrong, Jen?”  “I’m here because you need me, Carl,” Jenny said, trying to ease her way out of telling me what’s wrong.  “Let’s not talk about me.  You have pressing problems and I’m here to be your best friend.”  She gave me a smile.  Her smile could always lift up someone’s mood.  It has always lifted Jason’s mood and mine every time she does that.  And I know that smile always kept me from knowing things that I should have known.  Damn that smile!  So we went to the terrace where I know we could talk without interruptions. Forgetting everything else and my concern for her health, I told her my problems, my plan for a divorce and what I’m planning to do with my kids if it will pull through.  I told her  about Tina’s infidelity and dolled on about the problems that I am facing since I’m trying to finish law.  I told Jenny about the support Tina’s family has for me and that they would do everything so that I would get custody of my children.  As I kept on talking and explaining to her what’s been happening with my life, she listened.  Her eyes were glued to my face and listened to me go on and on about the problems of my life.  She didn’t say anything while I was talking, she just nodded her head trying to tell me that she was listening and was trying to assess the situation.  She was always a fair listener.  She didn’t judge.  She asked the right questions and trying to her best to not choose sides.  And knowing Jenny, even if you’re her best friend, if she knows that you were wrong, she would tell you.  She’s not the kind of person who would choose your side because you’re her best friend.  She would choose your side if she knows you’re right.  That was one of those moments when she chose my side.  But she never got to her point why she chose me because she started to cough.  I had to get her down from the terrace and back inside the warm living room.  When we got there, her boyfriend’s family were worried at her condition.  Aside from her leukemia, she also has a heart ailment.  Her heart was the one that usually gave her a hard time.  There are times when I forget that she has leukemia because her heart more of a burden to her than her cancer.  She never did bother with her cancer because her heart was her concern most when we were growing up.  And I guess that it’s giving her a hard time again.  We did everything we could just to keep her warm and get her to stop coughing.  I was honestly worried as hell for her.  Her body was even paler than when she got here, if that was even possible.  She was lying down, struggling for air because of her cough.  But I know that I would finally get the answer that I had been meaning to ask her before we went up the terrace.  Finally her cough subsided and she was able to breathe better.  She looked so harassed and tired I don’t exactly know how she handles it all.  She gave me a weak smile and started to sit-down.  “How are you, angel?” Matthew, her boyfriend, said while helping her up.  She leaned her body to him when she was already in a sitting position and was now trying her best to breathe properly.  “I’m okay now that you’re here,” she answered Matthew with a smile.  “I’m worried for you Jenny,” I finally said.  “What’s going on?”  She looked at me and gave me a weak smile.  She closed her eyes trying to take comfort from her boyfriend’s presence.  Matthew drew the covers to her covering her up to her shoulders when he saw that she was shivering.  She gave a sigh and opened her eyes to look at me.  “I don’t want to burden you with more concerns,” she slowly said.  “That would make me an awful best friend if I don’t know what’s wrong,” I replied.  “Is your heart giving you problems again?”  She gave me a smirk and closed her eyes again.  I thought the reason why she was smirking was because I was right.  But yet again, I forgot that she has leukemia.  What she said when she spoke again felt like being hit by a block of ice.  “I’m getting worse, Carl,” she said almost in a whisper.  “And it’s not the heart this time.  You know how much we were keeping it at bay.  But we can’t keep it at bay anymore.  I’m dying.”  “What?!?” Was all Matthew could say when he heard it.  He too was shocked at her announcement.  He slowly stood beside me, making sure that Jenny leaned on the wall for support before doing so.    I just stood there stunned.  I didn’t know what to say.  I just looked at her and saw the realization that she was right.  But I can’t accept that.  I won’t accept that.  “No,” I finally got the courage to speak.  “You can’t.  You were doing so well.  You were getting better.”  She gave me a dumbfounded look.  She looked at herself and then back at me.  A crease formed on her forehead telling me that she was upset.  “Why do you keep a blind eye at this?” She asked.  “Do you honestly think that I am better when you can clearly see that I’m not?  Carl, look at me.  You said so yourself I’m as pale as the moon.  I don’t see why you’re in denial when I’ve already accepted it.”  Matthew just stood there, looking at Jenny with sad eyes.  I could see that it hurt him very much to see her like that.  He lost a sister to brain cancer years ago, now knowing that Jenny would probably be facing the same fate, I don’t think he can take so much.  But he kept silent with the whole ordeal.  He just let me and Jenny talk things over.  But I know that he feels the way I do that he also didn’t want her to die.  But like Jenny said, there was nothing we can do to stop it.  “It’s long passed due, you know that,” Jenny continued to say.  “You know for a fact that I have been living on borrowed time, prolonging my life by sheer willpower.  But I’m tired.  I don’t want to fight anymore.  I have been fighting for years now.  Even the doctors thought that it was amazing that I’m still alive.  But it’s getting harder to fight back.  I don’t think I can take more of this.  I just want to rest already.”  But I’m as stubborn as ever.  I still don’t want to accept what she just told me.  I don’t want her to go.  I’m not ready.  I can’t lose her the way we lost Jason before.  It’s just not possible.  “NO!” I screamed.  “We lost Jason and now I’m losing you!  I can’t do this Jenny.  I need you here.  I can’t face that fact yet.  It’s too much for me.  I have so many things on my mind right now and this revelation is hurting me so much.  I can’t just sit down and say that I will be okay because I’m not and I won’t be if you leave me.  I can’t do this alone.  You can’t die! I won’t let you.”  This remark made Jenny smile in spite of herself.  I guess that short laugh made me and Matthew at ease even for a short time.  Hearing that laugh, I guess it just tells us that she’s still Jenny, despite the fact that she was giving up the fight already.  “I’ll still be here,” she replied.  “Remember what we agreed before?  Just look up at night.  My star will shine on you always so you know that I haven’t left you.”  “It’s not the same.”  “This is the reason why I don’t want to tell you,”  Jenny remarked while she massage her temples with her fingers.  “You have so many problems right now that I don’t want to burden you with more.”  “What about me? Are you going to hide that fact from me as well?  Are you even planning on telling me or were you just waiting for me to find out at your funeral?”  It took us a few moments to realize that the person who spoke was Matthew.  He kept silent all through the whole ordeal that  I completely forgot that he was there with us.  I saw his face already tear streaked.  I guess the thought of losing Jenny was so painful for him to bear more than what I a currently feeling.  After all, he did love Jenny with all his heart.  He considered her his soul mate and I guess with the knowledge that she would be gone in his life, he’s devastated.  Jenny lowered her head so that she would look into his eyes.  I can see by the way she acted that she was uncertain of what to say.   “I don’t know how to tell you,” Jenny finally said.  “I don’t want you to go through the same pain that you went through with Lyn.  I don’t want to leave as well but I can’t fight anymore.  I’m just so tired now.”  Matthew immediately went to her and captured her in his arms.  He held her there and started to cry even more.  I saw the two couples held each other and I just left them there.  I went up to the terrace and just stared at the stars.  The announcement that Jenny gave me was still mind numbing as ever and I don’t know what to do about it.  It’s clear that Jenny has accepted her fate.  After all, she has been living on borrowed time ever since we’ve found out.  But that fact still wouldn’t ease my pain.  I have lost so much in my life already.  I lost my younger sister when she was giving birth at the age of 15.  Chelsie Joy her daughter is a wonderful kid with the qualities of both her mom and dad but still I miss Jamie so much.  And then there’s Jason, my other best friend.  He died of aids.  When he died I have to be the support group for Jenny when she found out that he died.  I was as devastated as her but I have to be strong, after all she already had leukemia that time and I didn’t want her to think that dying was a way out of the pain.  And now, it was her time to go as well.  With all the problems that I have right now, I don’t know what to do anymore.  But one thing is certain, I would be there for her whatever happens.  Even if I’m not ready to give her up. Even if I would still try to fight for her health with every possible way I could.  I would be there to support her again.  I wouldn’t leave her to do this alone.  Even if she will leave me all alone.  I went back downstairs to the family that I know call my own and be just be with Jenny until He takes her away from me forever.    I hope you guys like the story…yes it’s just a story.  I’m sorry if I didn’t write this down on top but I wanted to see your reaction to it.  Anyway, I really hope you like it.  This is just one of those days when I was in a creative writing mood and just let my mind wonder off to make a story. Anyway, have a great day!  And don’t forget to have fun!

       Cotton Candy  Pink fluffy cloud Fallen from the sky It's time once again For cotton candy high   When I was a kid I used to love cotton candy especially right after going to church or after grocery shopping.  When my parents left the country, the cotton candy stopped being a staple diet for me as well.  I was introduced again to this heavenly treat when a friend of mine bought one to our usual RPG games.  When I saw the big fluff of puffy blue candy, I didn’t return it back to the real owner.  But with my deprived state of cotton candy bliss, I still shared the huge fluff with him (emphasis on the word "shared").  I ended up eating most to my embarrassment. =D  I missed eating this treat.  I love the way it melts in my mouth and daintily bite off the stick until there is nothing left.  I felt like a little girl again every time I hold that piece of that fluffy stuff in my hand.  I found  my childhood when I eat that cotton candy.  I hope you find your childhood as well.  It's really a good feeling to actually be a child every once in a while.  Even the simplest of things can make one smile.  Find that simple thing that makes you the happiest person in the world when you were young.  It really helps you with your life as you grow older.  I found mine in cotton candy.

       Another Time For Reflection   In my last song entry “Tears of the Dragon”, it has embodied what I have been feeling for the passed three months.  If you listen - or in this case read – the blog entry of the song, you will see that the singer has so much on him that he has to release lest it would consume him.    For too long now There were secrets in my mind For too long now There were things I should have said   Every feeling that I have has been pent up inside of me.  There are secrets, there are feelings that I should have let out long ago and just not kept it to myself.    In the darkness I was stumbling for the door To find the reason To find the time, the place the hour    Because of all these pent up emotions, I have become unfocused.  I couldn’t see clearly.  everything is so dark that I wander aimlessly all alone in the night.    Waiting for the winter sun And the cold light of day The misty ghost of childhood fears The pressure is building And I can’t stay away   There are so much pressure building inside of me that it’s really hard not to be afraid of them.  You wait in anticipation of what might happen to you but at the same time you’re scared of what it would mean.     From where I was I have wings I couldn’t fly From where I was I had tears I couldn’t cry    Because of all these pent up pressure, I know that I can do so many things but at the moment I have them on hold because it doesn’t mean anything to me anymore.    My emotions Frozen in an icy lake I couldn’t feel them  Until the ice began to break    I have become unfeeling.  I pretend to smile and laugh on the outside but on the inside I feel numb.  Some close friends of mine has been telling me that my eyes lost all emotions.  Before any of this, my eyes were the ones that were full of life.  All my emotions could be seen in my eyes.  But now, all you can see is darkness.  Blank. Empty.    I have no power over this You know I’m afraid The walls I build are crumbling The water is moving And I’m slipping away   I felt like I lost control of my whole body.  I fell like a robot doing things automatic. Wake up. Eat. Take a bath. Eat. Laugh. Eat. Sleep. Talk to people. Eat.  I need release.  I need to get everything out of me so that I can feel again.    I throw myself into the sea  Release the wave Let it wash over me To face the fear I once believed The tears of the dragon, for you and for me    This pent up depression, stress and anger should be released.  And I have done just that last Saturday when I had told my close friend one of the biggest secrets that I had kept from everyone including my family.  I have been keeping it from everyone for the passed two weeks.  The release of all the emotions and pain that I was suffering has got my mind cleared up and made me see things in a different light.  I wouldn’t lie to you that I had been thinking of killing myself because I thought I cannot handle all the problems that I have to deal with about my life.  But the release has helped me overcome the suicidal thoughts.  I know that I can overcome the tears of the dragon if I let myself go so that all the problems could be washed away.    Slowly I awake Slowly I rise The walls I built are crumbling The water is moving And I’m slipping away    It’s good to have friends who were there to listen.  They didn’t judge.  They were just there to listen and gave a shoulder to cry on while I let out all the pent up emotions that has been bothering me.  It was definitely a relief.  It was the release I needed to move on.  Though at the moment, I need directions on where to go.

       Day Two in the land of Midgard   So my first day, though it was short was more or less a success.  I ended up with 100 Zeny as a bonus for a job well done in my training, I’ve got chicken, 2 milk and 3 bananas for answering the questions correctly.  At the psychological test I ended up as a swordsman.  Needless to say that I didn't actually agree with them because my mind was set to play a thief.  So instead of biting the lure that they would give me something extra if I did choose to become a swordsman, I followed my own path and headed for the thieves' guild.  But before I can actually become one, I need to increase my level to at least a 9.  So what I did was I went to go look for trouble and fight off defenseless egg just to increase my stats.  I experience dying in that game for the first time.  I was busy with a drop that I didn't see that the green line below my character was dwindling slowly until it was too late.  The screen went black and I was back inside the city of Morroc.  The second time I head out and attack innocent pecopeco's egg, I was ready.  I learned that that little green line over the non-moving blue line below it was important.  I shouldn't let it turn read or else I will eventually go back to where I last met a Kafra.  Anyway, I had a few adventures here and there.  I got to argue with another player who was about to steal the red potion that I fought so hard to get from a pecopeco's egg.  Someone thought that I was an acolyte. Though I still wonder why they thought I was one.  I almost died again fighting off a drop but since I was ready the second time, I immediate press F1 to eat a banana and regain the lost health point.  I ended my game that night with a base level of 4 and a job level of 3.  All thanks to the unarmed and unassuming pecopeco's and ant's egg. =D  My younger brother also had fun making fun of me that night as well.  He was more or less helping me get the feel of the game and taught me how to level up without actually getting hurt in the first place (hence fighting off pecopeco's egg =D).  Then during my training, I was suppose to go from one end of a courtyard to another.  My brother told me to get out as fast as I can because the creatures there were fairly strong.  But on my way to the door he suddenly said, "Wait! Try to kill some creatures first so that you have leveled up already before you go in there."  I entered the door half-way to his speech.  Needless to say that I didn't get to level up in that place.  I ended the training at the current level that I was in which was level 1.  Anyway, I can't actually wait what will happened to me tonight or tomorrow night if I actually get to play sometime this week before I get to meet my friends on Saturday for our regular RPG game.  This would be another weird story to tell. =D

       Finally, I get to play Ragnarok   People call it RO for short.  When I heard it before, I thought people were taking up ROTC, even girls.  Then it just dawned to me that they’re talking about a different thing entirely.  They’re talking about a game called Ragnarok.  It’s an online RPG game.  People who has experience playing real RPG (not the computer type Final Fantasy or Diablo kind but the Dungeons and Dragons kind) would find the game very interesting.  Though the game does look and feel like a Diablo type of RPG, there are some aspects that makes it more like the Dungeons and Dragons kind of game.  I for one have never played Diablo.  I have solely played RPG where I get to see the Game Master (GM) sitting beside or in front of me telling me the scenario of the game with other players around me arguing with the GM or trying to get the feel of the place where we are in.  I’m used to roll dice to know if I hit or not.  I’m not used to wacking someone several times, numbers shooting out of the screen and eventually killing them.  I use my imagination for that.  And it’s really a weird feeling.  But still after some coaxing from my friends I’ve decided to try out the game.  And I need to get used to it still.  At the start of the game since I don’t know anything about it, I started with just going in training to find out if I could actually pull off being a thief in the place.  But time constraint and a grumbling tummy led me to get disconnected with the game right when I’m being asked questions regarding the things I need to do to play the game.  And after 5 questions and only getting 1 right answer, I know that I have so much to learn still.  And that’s just knowing what mouse button to click to do this particular action. =D  But even with that short experience, I know that I will be like my other friends who will get hooked on the game.  It’s really different from what I’m used to but I’m eager to learn a thing or two about it. =)  Let’s just hope that I can get a job as a GM in the game.  Jay said that it pays low but it’s better than being stuck in this office the whole day thinking of ways to slack off. =)

       Finally A TagBoard   After all the trial and errors that I had encountered, I’ve finally gotten myself a Tagboard.  Now people can actually get to post comments and might get instant replies from me. =D  But I still keep the old comment board.  It’s also essential so that people won’t get confused in what topics they are commenting on.  My Japanese friend Mikko actually visits I think once a week and post comments on my work.  Those are the things I really appreciate from people.  I don’t care if it’s a negative comment just as long as it’s a comment that can help me improve myself or the way I write.  In my past topics about the war, I have a jian to actually debate with because he has a different opinion about the war than me.  That’s really informative and really inspiring because I get to know how other people feel about the war.  Different opinion really help me in particular understand what’s been happening in our world today and how they can actually improve out life.  I guess comments board and this new tagboard is a good addition to my blog.  Now only will I get other people’s opinion easily, I can actually comment on them with other people so we can actually have a good discussion going. =)

       Test from emode   Mitch, you answered 22 out of 30 questions correctly!   Congratulations! Your score is in the 87th percentile. This means that if one hundred people took the test with you, your score would rank higher than 86 of them on average.  When we analyzed your test, we also discovered that when it comes to visual-spatial ability, you measure in the 70th percentile. This score indicates you have unusually strong abilities when it comes to spotting patterns in the world around you. You're easily able to envision things spatially in different positions, and this allows you to determine what spatial patterns are present. Compared with you, most others lack the creative ability and/or skill to imagine the movement of objects or patterns in time and space. ***  Mitch, your destiny is to be a Provider   Whether you know it or not, this is the role that is most in tune with who you are at your core. As a Provider, you have a genuine nurturing concern for the welfare of others and you're eager to serve them. You can recognize exactly what people need and your friendly, helpful, social nature makes them feel comforted. With your kind and generous heart, you are personable, talkative, and outward with your emotions, and your openness and sensitivity makes you concerned about the way others view you. Along these lines, be careful not to blame yourself when things go wrong. You cannot prevent bad things from happening, even though your tendency to be orderly with a strong sense of right and wrong may lead you to believe you can. Accept that you do what you can to take care of things and that this will get you far in the world.  ***  Mitch, your emotions are triggered by your underlying belief in Integrity   In other words, your uncompromisingly honest nature directly affects how, and how often, you experience certain feelings.  For example, your test results indicate that you're most fulfilled when you hold fast to your moral ideals. That factor is directly related to your fundamental belief in integrity and the range of emotions it triggers.  Based on your belief in integrity, where do you rank in the emotional landscape? Which of your emotions dominate your life? And how can you learn to control your emotions? ***  Mitch, your best quality shines through in how Intelligent you are!   The fact that you're a smart person who is more able to understand complex concepts than many other people are really draws people to you! But that's not the only thing. Your answers on the test indicate you're psychologically and emotionally stable and better able than most people to tolerate even the roughest situations. You are a person with a strong will who is typically determined to follow through on difficult demands and meet important goals, too.  In all, there are 15 qualities that help define you when you're at your best. Those are the traits potential employers, friends, and partners look for in you. What makes you unique is your particular distribution of those 15 qualities.  We've found that your particular combination of qualities is rare — only 5 in 10,000 people share the same general mix of traits. Those are great odds if you're trying to show a potential employer, colleague, friend, or date why you're exactly the right person for them.

       It's My Last Day In Miriam   Since I was already accepted as a GM in Level-Up, I have finally resigned to this insect infested, bee attacking office that is named the Environmental Studies Institute of Miriam College.  As much as I thought that i would be jumping for joy and laughing out loud that I would no longer be attacked by ants, mosquitos and bees, I find myself saddened somewhat.  Who would have thought that I would actually liked it here even for just a little bit.  Honestly, my problem here was only my boss and my aunt.  I honestly don't have a problem with the rest of the people in the office.  They are all very nice and I have to admit very helpful in situations when I really needed them the most.  But leave I must for my sanity and health...plus the probability that I will be able to fulfill my dreams of fame and fortune.  I actually see myself missing the people here.  The silent lunch time I get to spend with Cecil.  The jokes I share with Tina.  The free meal when someone has a birthday or something important to celebrate.  Not doing anything for a whole day and actually get away with it.  Well, I hope I don't regret leaving here.  I know it's time to move on and moving on I am doing.

       I Got In Level Up!!!   I was honestly shocked last night because I got a call from Level-Up telling me that I would start working on Monday.  I was really shocked by the call because I had already given up hope that I would actually get in.  I even have a blog entry ready to post here today that I didn't get in.  Well, as you know, I wouldn't be posting that particular blog entry because I did get in, much to my surprise.  Now I am just hoping that I only get a Monday to Friday Schedule.  I really don't want to work on a weekday.  It's my "Family Day" and at the same time my "RPG day".  I really hope that I get the weekends off.  Or else I wouldn't be able to see my friends on Saturday and I won't get to spend time with my family on Sunday.  Hohum...I can't get everything I want right?  But anyway, at least I'm leaving that ant infested office right?  I wouldn't see Mr. Bee again.  Though I would miss the occasional butterfly decorating my monitor.  But I'm so happy that I would never go back to that place. =D  And it's all thanks to Level-Up.  Thanks Jay! If you hadn't told me there was an opening, I wouldn't even get in!

       Mika Bulmer   Another school year starts in Salem University here.  I was honestly thinking that this year would be the same as the year before when I was a freshman.  Boring.  Routinary.  Everything will be predictable.  I was wrong.  Last year, I joined the taekwondo team of the school just for kicks (pardon the pun).  I’m the kind of person who just tried out and got in.  Don’t get me wrong I have been studying this martial art ever since I was a kid but I’m not necessarily a joiner of clubs and varsity and stuff.  I’m just there for the discipline.  But joined I did and not to brag or anything I’m one of the best in our team.  This year, we’re taking in new members.  I’m one of those people who are assigned to get people to join the team.  Though I definitely wonder why.  You see, I’m not a very social person.  I like to help out in the team as best I can but I know that I’m the last person who you should get to convince people that this is the best place to be.  I usually keep to myself. My trusty pocketbook always with me wherever I go.  So when Carl told me that I was going to be guarding the booth of the taekwondo team, I honestly didn’t know what to do.  I did help out in setting up the booth but when it was time to get people to sign up, well let’s just say that because of me, there aren’t that much students who were interested in the Korean Martial arts nowadays.  So that morning, during the sign-up, I was at the booth reading a book.  I wasn’t really minding people if they would sign-up or not.  In my personal opinion, you shouldn’t really convince people to join the group.  They should be willing to be approach you and sign-up themselves.  In taekwondo, you really need discipline.  People say that it’s the most useless form of martial arts.  I say that they should try to get one of us in battle before you tell me otherwise.  But unfortunately, Carl had a different opinion.  “You know that we won’t be getting any members if you keep on reading that book,” he said as he approached the booth.  “What are you expecting me to do here anyway?” I asked as I put my book down and faced him.  He was already half-dressed in his taekwondo uniform.  He wore a plain white shirt for his top and the lower garment with the black belt tied around his waist.  He looked at me with a questioning look before he answered, “well, for starters, you can at least smile.”  I gave him a smile that meant to be sarcastic.  He raised one eyebrow at me and just sighed in dismay. ‘why do I even bother’ he said to himself.  “It’s a good thing you’re here though,” I suddenly said as I stood up and gather my things.  “I have to go find the others so we can actually do some exhibition kicks and other stuff that might get people to sign.”  “That’s using your head,” he replied and sat on the chair that I had once occupied.  “I think the girls are in their locker room dressing up while the guys are out checking the cheerleading booth.”  “So like them to do that,” I muttered under my breath hoping that Carl didn’t hear.   Unfortunately, he did but he just chuckled at my statement.  “Just come back with everyone,” he remarked and stared to coax people to sign and the group.  I hurried to the girls’ locker room when all of a sudden I felt something strange.  I stopped at my tracks and looked around to find out where that strange feeling is coming from.  I just noticed a girl wearing all black hurrying as she was passing through the crowd.  She was pretty much ordinary looking, as ordinary as any Goth girl could be.  But the strange thing about her is that she kept on walking without bumping into anybody as she passed by.  She just kept on walking, people unconsciously stopping or getting out of the way or she would go sideway for a split second and proceeded to walk on the path that she made for herself.  She passed me without even looking.  There was something definitely something strange about her.  But at the moment, my mind is pretty occupied to think of anything else except the exhibition that we were planning to show the student body to coax them to join the team. ---------------  The exhibition went well.  We didn’t humiliate ourselves not like what had happened to them last year when I was signing up.  Funny thing was, they were horrible last year in their exhibition, but still I signed up in the team.  I guess I made the right choice.  I was coming out of the locker room after a shower and proceeded for my first class. Asian literature, my favorite subject.  I guess it’s because it’s a side of me that I need to find out about.  I am what people would call a half-breed.  My mom’s Japanese and my dad’s English.  But I practically grew up knowing my European heritage than my oriental one.  I’m very fascinated by it.  It wasn’t like I didn’t want to know, there aren’t many places in London that I can learn about my mom’s culture.  I only know about the basic stuff about my mom’s culture.  So this subject might help me out.  When we moved to Boston, I was really looking forward to learn so much about the Japanese culture.  I know that it won’t be as great as going to Japan itself but it has a vast library of the subject and I’m happy about it.  As I sat down on my usual place near the back row, I was looking around the room to see who are the new comers.  There was one guy in particular that got my attention.  Like me, he was keeping to himself.  But there is something else about him that’s so different than the rest of the students.  When our professor arrived to start the class, everyone got to their seats and started to pay attention.  I tried to concentrate on the lesson at hand but my eyes keep drifting back to my mysterious classmate who was studiously taking down notes.  It’s amazing how he can write and listen at the same time without even trying to look at the notes that he was writing.  His gray eyes intently focused on the professor, not even looking at anyone else in the room.  This really got me curious.  Not even our last year’s top student was that intent of listening to the teacher.  So I’ve decided to learn more about my mysterious classmate.  I focused on the energy that surrounds me.  I took a pen and a piece of scratch paper and started to doodle.   What are you thinking about?  I wrote.   The lesson. I wrote back.  I looked at what I wrote and was troubled by what I wrote.  ‘That’s not normal,’ I thought to myself.  So I tried again, focusing more energy as I concentrate.   No, really.  What are you thinking about?  I wrote again.   I told you I’m paying attention to the lesson.  I wrote back.  This time I know that I’m going nowhere if I continued on like that.  I know that I wouldn’t get the answer that I needed if I keep using my magic.  So I need a different approach.  Something that I haven’t done at all.  After class, when the professor dismissed us already.  I cautiously approached him.  He was just collecting his things and putting it in his backpack when I finally got to him.  I gave him one of my rare smiles and said hi.  To my surprise, he also gave a smile and said hello.  Funny thing is, I’ve fought men twice my size in the arena and my nerve never failed me.  And now, my knees are shaking just trying to talk to a guy who I know I can beat in a heartbeat.  I guess he was waiting for me to say something because of the way he was looking at me so I muster all my courage that was surprisingly leaving me one at a time.  I took a deep breath and said, “um, do you mind if I borrow your notes in today’s lesson?  I couldn’t understand the last part of his lesson.”  “Sure.” He answered, opening his bag to take his notes and gave it to me. I smiled again as I took his notebook and opened some pages.  To my surprise it was really neat and very organized.  I was completely shocked by it and at the same time embarrassed with my own notes.  “Wow!” I exclaimed. “You have a nice hand-writing.”  “Thanks,” he replied. “By the way, my name is Adam.”  “Mika,” I answered holding my hand out to him.  “This would really help me a lot.  Thanks.”  “What’s your interest in Asian Literature?” He asked as we were heading out of the classroom.  I can feel that all eyes were on Adam and me as we walked down the school hall.  I guess they were kind of shock that I was actually talking to someone who wasn’t my teammate in taekwondo.  I just ignored them and answered Adam’s question.  “It’s mostly because of my mother,” I answered.  “I want to know more about my mom’s heritage.  I’m half-Japanese.  I’ve read our history and know a lot of what had happened but I’m very fascinated about their literature.  It’s very different from the English literature that I was so used to.”  “That’s great,” he said with interest.  “Any plans of going to Japan?”  “Maybe one day.” I answered.  “I guess when I graduate.”  We kept on talking until we’ve reach the door going towards the university’s front lawn where all the different clubs and organization were to set-up to get members.  “By the way,” I asked.  “Are you interested in joining any clubs this school year?”  “I want to but I don’t know which group to join,” Adam replied looking around the busy lawn.  “Do you want to join the Taekwondo team?” I said.  “I’m one of the members there who helps out in the recruiting.  It’s alright if you don’t know the sport that well.  We’ll be able to teach you so that you can join the competitions and other stuff.”  “That’s great!” He exclaimed with a smile.  “Where do I sign up?”  I led him to the booth where people were starting to gather and signing up.  I guess when I left for class, Carl started to recruit like crazy.  There were a lot of students falling in line. Among them were students who were just curious, asking questions but don’t sign at all.  There is one particular group of students who were there.  It was Jose Lopez and his gang.  I guess they’re starting to go around and try to bully the incoming freshmen again.  I had the misfortune of being one of those freshmen last year.  But fortunately, they didn’t get to harass me much when I found out what they were really thinking  that I should be doing for their gang.  They ended not going to class the next day.  Poor Raul.  He seemed like a nice guy.  He’s just got into bad company.  “Don’t forget that we have try-outs later, Mika,” Carl told me when I arrived.  “We need to know who is varsity material and who is here just to learn.”  “No problem,” I answered.  “I’ll be there.”  I saw that Adam is already finished signing up.  When he was close to me, I told him what Carl told me a while ago.  He nodded and said that he would actually try if he is one of those varsity material that Carl was looking for.  “Where do you live anyway?” He asked as we were heading out of school.  “I live in the dorm,” I answered pointing towards the building where I presently was staying.  “Really? Me too!” Adam said as we crossed the street towards our building. “What room are you?”  “Ten.”  “That means were on the same floor.  I’m at fifteen, the last room in the dorm.  Shall I meet you later when we get back for the try-outs?”  I wanted to say no but something told me that I need to stick to this guy.  He might be acting normal on the outside but there was something about him that’s different from the rest.  Like, he’s a mage like me.  But I don’t have that much power to focus whether or not he has magic or not.  I just have to make do with my hunches.  “Sure.”  “Great,” he said as we stopped at my room. “I’ll pick you up later, say 6:30?”  “That’s fine,” I answered as I opened my door.  “See you later.”  I heard him walking towards his room when I closed my door and leaned on it.  He’s one mysterious person.  Mysterious, but fascinating nonetheless.  I quickly hit the showers to get ready for the tryouts. -------------  The gym was packed with the different organizations that were scheduled for try-outs that evening.  The place was separated into equal proportions depending on how much room you need to have for the demonstration and exhibition.  Carl was there with the rest of the group listing down the different members and whom they will test in the try-outs.  He was calling the new members by name and partnering them with the members of the team that was about the same build and height as them and started to spar.  Adam and I arrived while they were just making the preparations.  I was separated from him when I was up to spar the female potentials.  It was all going well until this girl was tagging along a guy who would most likely fit in the wrestling team than the taekwondo team. “Please,” the girl said.  “For me?  I want us to take this together.”  “I don’t need this, Lisa,” the guy answered.  “This is a girl’s sport.  I don’t know why you even listed me here in the first place.”  “Because I want us to take this together,” Lisa repeated.  “Would you at least give it a try?”  The guy shrugged but finally conceded to - who I think – his girlfriend.  He started to walk towards the mat waiting for his challenger.  “I’ll take this one, Carl,” I told him as I made a few warm up exercises before proceeding to the mat.  I started to assess the situation.  I guess he really was a wrestler judging from the bulging muscles that he has and the way he was waiting for me to approach the mat.  His stance was also indicating that he has more of the upper body strength than anything else.  I know that he’s a hard opponent to beat.  But I have to at least try.  I didn’t like the way he said that taekwondo was a girl’s sport.  I have to teach him a lesson one-way or the other.  I focused on my power as I was doing my warm up exercise.  I started to harness my strength, speed and flexibility.  I know that to beat this guy I have to move faster and more agile that he is so that I would actually get the upper hand of things.  As I was doing my warm ups I started to focus on storing my chi.  When I know that I was ready, I approach him.  “A girl?” He said in disbelief.  “A little girl is going to challenge me?  Is that the best you can do?”  “Enough talk,” I remarked.  “Let’s see what you got.”  I readied my stance as he readied his.  I started to concentrate on releasing my energy.  Hoping against hope that nobody would notice what I was doing.  I studied him for a while.  I was right, he was a wrestler.  One thing that I don’t like in the martial arts that I chose is that when in real close combat, I won’t be able to fight well.  For a wrestler, all he has to do is try to grab me and pin me down then that would be game over for me.  I have to think of a way that I can use my kicks and knock him out without him getting very close to me pin me down.  This is one battle that I know would be very difficult for me.  We started to spar, he was getting the upper hand of things.  I couldn’t even get near him to launch my attack.  He was charging and trying to get a hold of me.  He got to hit me in the stomach but did little damage for me to give up so easy.  I gave him multiple kicks that were fast beyond any normal human capacity with each kick trying to hit different part of his body.  One made contact but it wasn’t strong enough to cause heavy damage to him.  We kept this dance until I tried to kick him in the face but he had a chance to catch my legs just mere inches away from his nose.  “I got the point,” he said as he let go of my leg.  “Fine, I’ll try this sport for a few months.  Let’s see what it would do to me afterwards.”  There were people clapping at the performance that had just been done.  But I wasn’t satisfied with the result.  I wanted that student to be beaten badly and not just convince him by a draw.  Well, at least my point was reached one way or another.  Maybe next time, I’ll do better.  As I walked back to the bleachers I saw Adam looking at me intently.  And as if being free from a trance, he suddenly smiled and gave me two thumbs up sign.

       My Diskette Has An Identity Crisis   I'm a little annoyed by this actually.  I don't know how it happened.  One minute I was in the office fixing a notepad document that my boss needed.  The next minute the diskette I used in saving advance blogs sort of morphed into the diskette that I use for work!  Honestly it's weird!  I didn't know what happened.  What's really bothering me is that I have three stories there that I haven't posted yet and I don't remember how the story goes anymore.  If I write it again, I don't think it would be the same.  I actually loved those stories too. =(  Another thing is the blogs that I was suppose to post here but didn't anymore because the topic isn't actually applicable in my life anymore.  Though I know that it's useless it's actually a good read.  I was actually going to show some friends of mine those blogs but since this happend...well...I can't anymore.  And finally, the Garfield comics that I have been saving.  There were about 50 of them that I haven't post yet and now, I don't know how to go through each one and get them.  Anyway, I know that I would eventually make new stories or try to remember the old ones and I can get new comics for my blog but it's still weirded me out what had actually happened.  I honestly just want to know how it actually happened so that I can have a peace of mind.

       Why I didn’t like to go on picnics        Well, when I was young we never did get to experience something like this but I wouldn’t want to tease Mother Nature.  I don’t want to ruin a perfectly good day in the sun to just be teased by nature so you won’t have fun for the day.

       Another Song   Here’s another old Close-up song that’s very nice.  It’s one of my favorite songs that was used in the Close-up commercials.    Closer You and I    Hey there’s a look in your eyes Must be love at first sight You were just part of a dream Nothing more so it seemed  But my love couldn’t wait much longer Just can’t forget the picture of your smile ‘Cause every time I close my eyes You come alive  The closer I get to touching you The closer I get to loving you Give it time just a little more time We’ll be together  Give a little smile that special smile A twinkle in you eye and a little while Give it time just a little more time So we can get closer, you and I  Then could I love you more So much stronger than before Why does this seem like a dream  So much more so it seemed  I guess I found my inspiration With just one smile you take my breath away So hold me close and say you’ll stay With me now  The closer I get to touching you The closer I get to loving you Give it time just a little more time We’ll be together  Give a little smile that special smile A twinkle in you eye and a little while Give it time just a little more time So we can get closer, you and I

       Another Test     You represent... naivete. So innocent and trusting... you can be very shy at times, but it's only because you're not sure how to act.  You give off that "I need to be protected vibe."  Remember that not all people are good.  Being too trusting will get you easily hurt.    urlLink   What feeling do you represent?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Hmm...the pic looks like Sakura.  Okay...I do feel naive sometimes. Hehehe...

       First Day   My first day at Level-Up was honestly speaking, not what I was expecting.  I actually will be playing the game the whole day.  It was honestly a big change.  From the neverending nagging of my aunt to do better, now it's just have fun, learn the game and try to be nice to everybody.  People in the office are nice, but of course its a change since I was used to working with around 5 people in the office.  Now they are having trouble on where they need to put their desk. =)  One sad thing about it though is that I have the Mondays off.  I have to work on Saturdays and Sundays.  Something that I would have a trouble adjusting.  I still get to play RPG in Greenbelt but I don't think that I would be able to join them in the evenings (which is sad since my brother already allowed me to).  I won't be able to go to church on the usual time that I go.  I have to find a new time to go to church now.  And this August, I'm going to have to find a way to convince my new boss to allow me to go to the province and celebrate my goddaughter's birthday.  I had made a promise since last year.  I am determined to go there whatever it takes...now how to convince them is a problem.  It's a change...a change that I hope would make me stay until the end of my contract.

       Yesterday Was Pretty Amazing   Yesterday was a pretty amazing day for me.  Not only did I get to see pandabear Glenn and his girlfriend June, I got to play two different RPG games, had some laughs and ended up in New Manila celebrating Justin Armand Kho's birthday!  Plus the fact that KIMI RAIKKONEN took pole position for later's race made my night the best night of my life.  It was really a great day yesterday.  I also got to do my whale impression (though embarrasing at it may be was pretty amazing) and people get to treat me with respect because of the new job that I have.  i am still currently lost for words because of what's been happening with my life.  But I know that I am the only one who can determine whether I would make my life better or worse for the year.  I'm determined to make it better, make my parents proud of the decision that I've made and just enjoy myself as much as I could.  I'm also happy that my friend Jay was at his element that night despite the fact that that afternoon we was pretty low and down.  But he got himself together (or [no offense jay] did a pretty good impression that he got himself together) and was the man to talk to last night.  He made everyone laugh and he was on the spotlight. =) I haven't seen him captivate audience the way he did yesterday.  It was as if he was the host of the night.  But poor thing, his voice was already hoarse but he still kept the people around him entertained and was at edge in their seats just listening to him talk.  I haven't laughed so much like I had laughed last night.   Anyway, Belated Happy Birthday Justin!!!  Jay, YOU THE MAN!!!

       In Dealing with Pecopecos...   She met Kawangakid in Alberta.  After giving him some arrows for Ktk8, and helping out some lost wanderers in this land of Midgard, they went their separate ways.  Kawangakid went out to the forest of Payon while Kirsikka, stayed and checked out the local pub.  It was quiet in Alberta, there aren't much people there. Most of the travellers there came to the city by boat the same as she was.  She passed through some people she met on the boat.  One of them was very drunk he already fell asleep on the table.  Kirsikka caught a faint blue tint on the man's pocket.  She lookedround to check if anyone was looking at her.  When she found out that none of them was paying attention to her, she slid of her seat and gracefully glided towards the drunken man.  Without anyone looking, she quickly took the shiny blue object from the drunken man, paid for her drink and headed outside the pub.  She then went to an isolated place in the city, which wasn't really hard to find since most of the place in Alberta was deserted.  When everything was already clear, she started to chech out her loot.  It wasn't much though, just a few jelopies, 3 animal skins, grasshopper's legs, a poring doll and a strange grayish rock.  After poring over her new finds, she kept everything in her bag to be sold later to a dealer.  But she was still holding the strange gray rock.  It was the first time she'd seen that kind of thing.  As Kirsikka examined the strange rock, it instantly broke into two.  "Dang!" Kirsikka said out loud to no one in particular.  "I broke it!"  As she was trying to put the two pieces back together, the world suddenly spun and I find myself on the other side of the city.  The people looked at me with curious stares.  They are probably wondering where she had came from.  She looked around the area where she "landed" and found herself near the docks.  There was a sailor calling people who were planning to go to the Sunken Ship or the Izlude Marina.  Looking around and finally deciding on what to do, Kirsikka went to the sailor, gave him the last  five hundred zennies that she has and headed towards the boat that would take her to the Izlude Marina.  The voyage was short.  It only took about 5 days to get to Izlude and when Kirsikka got there, she sold the items that she had previously got from the monsters that she had faced and that drunken man.  Kirsikka went around and found out that the gray stone that she got was actually a Fly wing.  It helps non-magic users to teleport from one area to another.  She figured that that might help me out when she gets to encounter monsters that she know that she can't fight against.  So Kirsikka purchased some of those and a couple of necessities that she knows that she would need and headed out after giving the nice lady Kafra some of my life essence to keep me alive, she left the city of Izlude and headed towards the city of Prontera.  It was an easy trek going there.  On her way there, she was battling monsters left and right, training herself to be one of the best thief in Midgard.  Kirsikka new to the trade, she hasn't even been stealing much.  Just trying to kill them and get the loot when their already dead.  Kirsikka knows that it's very disrespectul to the dead but she also knows that her skills werent good enough to actually try and steal from the monsters without actually getting caught.  She remembered when she tried stealing one time from a bigfoot...that wasn't one of her memorable experience but it's enough for her to learn that when you're new to the trade, you have to start small.  As Kirsikka was battling those monsters on her way to Prontera, she getting more loots than I could possibly handle.  When she reached the city, she enterd the some of the shops and sold her loot yet again.  When she was finished, she again purchased more items that would help her in her trek towards the City of Morocc.  After the preparations, she was ready to set out again.  Giving her life essence to the lady Kafra, she then headed out towards the Prontera forest where she started battling monters again.  Training did help her become more agile that the monsters barely hit her anymore.  She started batting out stronger monster that she knows that she can fight.  And while she gains experience from all the fighting, she has been improving on the attack strategy that she makes.  She knows that she was getting better.  And she loves the feeling of power as she quickly slice of Porings with her knife.  As it happens that Kirsikka was travelling in Socrat dessert when she encountered her first Pecopeco.  It was really a magnificent creature.  But she needs the monster to gain more training.  Inching closer, she tackled the giant beast and started slashing it with her Cutter.  She dodges and slashed with swift movements that the Pecopeco was didn't know where to start pecking her.  But it was really hard work.  The feathers of the beast was strong and thick that the cutter was having trouble slicing through it.  But after numerous attempts, Kirsikka fanally killed him.  She was proud.  This was the first time she had battled a Pecopeco and won.  Though, she had suffered much in the process, Kirsikka smiled inspite of herself as she headed to the closed palm tree and rested to get her strenght back.  Drinking some milk and eating some meat while she rested in the shade she regained her energy quickly ready to strike at her next victim.  But as it happens, she has come across a pair of Pecopecos on her way to Morocc.  Feeling that her luck was still at her side, Kirsikka started towards one of them and started attacking yet again.  But Kirsikka did not anticipate that the other Pecopeco was her mate.  The other creature started attacking her as well. not knowing what to do, she kept her concentration on one of them trying her best to finish the job and start attacking the next one but she was blacking out.  She couldn't open her eyes anymore.  She fell and went into a deep slumber.  She woke up looking at the face of the lady Kafra she met a few days ago in Prontera.  "So, you're finally awake," the lady Kafra said smiling at Kirsikka.  "You be careful next time.  I'll be hanging on to this until you are really safe from your journey."  She continued as she held her essence in her hand.  Kirsikka thanked the good Kafra and headed off once more towards the city of Morocc... -------  Not much of a story but I hope you liked it anyway.  Feel free to give your comments out, okay?

       He Apologized   This morning was really a great shock to me.  Marc apologized for what he had done to me.  But as much as I have forgiven him from the time I was so worried I could lose my job, there are still some things that I could not accept.  But he is right though.  We do work at the same office so we really need to get along even if it's only for professional reasons.  But there are still issues and things that is still bothering me though.  And I can't seem to gather my thoughts whether I did the right thing or not.  Anyway, am I too nice to actually accept his apology?  I mean, he did apologize for telling on me but he told me that I made a wrong choice of friends I can trust.  But I am a little sorry for him when he told me that some of his friends don't talk to him anymore because of this incident.  I can see that he has a lot of things in his mind that I know he's also suffering from this mess.  Honestly, I'm confused.  Have I done the right thing for accepting his apology?  Why didn't I say anything about his own broadcast about him being a GM and I just let him get away for telling my boss that I told someone when the fact is he told more people than me?  Did I do the right thing by just being silent with all of this?  Hohum... Now, I'm more confused than before.  But at least he did told me that he has high respect for me.  Though he still is a little arrogant.  He still thinks that he has a higher rank than me but I think it's his nature.  Anyway, I hope this confusion will clear up someday.  Til then, I'm still lost and confused but still doing my job as much as I can.

       I Am Now A Thief   Anyway, after grueling days of fighting off pecopeco and ant eggs, drops, porings, roda frogs and condors, I finally got my level high enough to be a thief.  So, I went to Morocc Ruins, went inside one of the Pyramids and went to the thief's guild.  The way to become a thief was really easy.  I thought that I would die in the process but I had fun and I got more than enough mushrooms to become a thief. =)  It's really a great feeling too.  Now as a thief, I've finally got hold of my friends and I've joined their party.  And it really took me time to get to them.  There was one night I died twice even before reaching my friends before they logged off for the night.  Then there was this incident where I accidentally attacked a very strong monster on my way to my friends so I died again.  But when I found them, I was really happy.  I even had a conversation with a friend of mine while we were resting at the fountain in Prontera. =D  And getting into a party was really a fun experience as well.  You gang up on one really strong monster and get high enough experience to level up! It's really great.  Though it was only for a short period of time, it was really great to be apart of a team than just going off alone.  Anyway, it was really good to know that even in the world of Midgard, I can count on my friends to save my butt. =D  As for my other character, I'm currently with a party of just randomly selected group of people.  I was invited and just so that I won't seem to be someone who knows the game more and get a point of view of the other people playing the game, I accepted.  The guy who invited me was really nice (or has a crush on my character, I'm not really sure which) he gave me 500 zenny, a hat, sandals, purple sunglasses and a better weapon.  He also gave me some other things like herbs and stuff.  Anyway, after that first encounter, I haven't seen him since.  I'm honestly relieved with that knowledge because I'm not used to talking to people and they make advances towards me even if it's only in cyberspace.  Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of friends on the internet but those people I have a connection with because we share the same interest.  This guy, I really don't know what his interest are.  Just the fact that he plays Ragnarok.  Anyway, that's what's been happening in the world of Midgard in the eyes of both Kirsikka and Kirsche.  I wonder what will happened to me next time?

       What Am I Doing?   Why do I get the feeling like I can't please myself these days?  After I left Miriam and went to work here at Ragnarok, I find myself not enjoying as much as I would want to and is again, looking for an alternative to leave.  Even if I'm not in a hurry to do so, I still don't get myself why I'm not content with what I have right now?  What is wrong with me these days that I don't seem to be satisfied with the things I have and the things I'm doing?  Is this because of what's been happening to my personal life?  After that incident (and I still can't get myself to tell the world) I find myself empty.  I smile, laugh and just act normal on the outside but on the inside I'm devoid of all emotions.  I honestly couldn't care less if one day I get rammed by a car or get in a middle of a cross fire.  But still I wonder why?  I am not satisfied with what I have now.   The Ragnarok job, is kids work.  Even a 7year old could do a better job than what I can offer them here.  But after that interview and exam that I took yesterday at Victoria Court (where I was there the whole day) I find myself accepting this job more than the one being offered there.  I mean, Victoria Court offers great benefits that I would love to have but nowadays they just seem trivial to me.  Like I don't care because I don't see myself ever using it in the longrun.  I honestly want to know what's wrong with me.  I'm not like this on normal circumstances.  I've changed but I'm afraid that it was for the worse and not for the better.  How I wish I know what's going on on this head of mine because even if it's my head, I honestly don't know why I'm thinking these things.  To top things off, one of the GMs I work with doesn't seem to like me that much.  Or either that I don't like him... I guess it's his arrogance that getting to me.  It really surprised me to hear one of the admins calling him "Sir Marc".  I'm even thinkin if it's just sheer jelousy because I am of the same status as that guy but she never calls me "ma'am" or is it really becasue I find it so arrogant of him to let people call him "sir"?  I know my life shouldn't be confusing and I'm just making things confusing for me but I just don't know.  I still feel empty inside and I don't know why but I have to get out of this emptiness because I really don't want blood to be spilled in the office.  I can take arrogance up to a certain level but I am still human after all.  If that guy doesn't humble himself, he'll find that I am not one to be challenge.  I don't go down without a fight.  So goes my conclusion...I don't have one yet.  But I'll get one.  I just have to figure out what's wrong with me first.

       THE EMBRACE   It was around 1230 AD.  A time when darkness has ruled over our lands.  A time when people live in fear about the strange and the unexplained.  A time when faith is your only salvation.  My story starts here, in Lemi, a small town near the city of Lappeenranta, in South Karelia, the south-eastern part of Finland.  My journey to that unknown place…darkness.  It wasn’t always this dark.  I remember my childhood.  Growing up in the basking sunlight.  Enjoying my childhood playing in the fields with my friends.  I used to enjoy the mornings.  I enjoyed viewing the beautiful blue skies and white clouds that formed into different shape and sizes: small bunnies, mountains, flowers and birds.    And the people.  There were a few people who didn’t know my family.  We own a small farm in the outskirts of Lemi.  My parents were known to be the best farmers in our town.  They sold the best crops and the healthiest herd and poultry.  My parents were well respected by their fellow farmers and I had so many friends because of this.  As you may figure, life couldn’t go any better than this.  So it could only go bad or worse.  My family’s life, tradition and culture, gone in a week’s time. The Soujanen family ends with me.  And all because of HIM.  I had a bad feeling about him the moment he stepped inside our homestead.    Rumors of Cain’s children living among us were spread wide throughout Lappeenranta.  But father said that they were only rumors.  No vampire would be interested in a farm such as ours or any other farms located in Lemi.  “Why would they?” I remembered him say before that fateful day.  “This is a farming village.  There is no gain in using poor farmers like us.  They would just get bored with us and leave immediately.”  He was right about getting bored.  But leaving was another matter.  It was that time of the year when many weary travelers pass through our small village on their way to Helsinki for the annual festival that was being held there.  And it was customary to let these travelers into our homes and treat them like they were a part of the family. And it was in that night that a stranger appeared at our doorstep.  It was raining hard that night.  My family was in the small living area when there was a knock on our door.  “Who could be traveling at this hour of the night?” My mother wondered.  My father opened the door to see a man in a hood and he was hurt bad.  “Please,” he begged.  “I need a place to stay, just for the night.”  But he collapsed before any of us could respond.  He was as pale as the moon and even though drenched to the bones, you can see the handsome features despite the old age.  The look on his face told me that someone was chasing him but I have no idea what or who.  My parents being the kind people that they were gathered him up and led him to the small room that was specially made for this time of year.  Since there were many travelers passing along Lemi, my father built a room suited for travelers.  That night I wondered why this man was so pale.  Father said it was because of the loss of blood.  He also said that the man might have been a rich merchant and that he had been robbed and should have been left for dead on the streets.    That was the only time my father made a mistake about people.  And because of that mistake, I will never see him again. And so Marius became a part of the household until he was strong enough to leave…unfortunately, he didn’t.  My mother was the one who nursed him back to health.  She was the one who dressed his wounds and gave him food everyday.  “Such a strange man, that Marius” I heard my mother said to one of our neighboring farmer’s wife.  “He doesn’t want the windows to be opened during the day.  He keeps to himself most of the time and only comes out of the room during dinner.”  I should have seen the signs.  I have read about them before in the town library.  Cain’s children were cursed never to walk in the light among the Children of Abel.  The Higher Being has cursed these creatures never to experience sunlight.  But still I did not warn my parents.  I still believe what my father told me that vampires would not want to have to do with this farming village.  I don’t feel comfortable when Marius is around.  Every night he joins the family in the living room and had small conversation with my father while my mother mends the clothes and I reading near the fireplace.  But that fateful night, he approached me instead of my father. “Good evening, Engkeli,” Marius said soft voice.   His presence has such power and intensity that it took all my willpower and reserve not to bow low.  “Good evening, good sir,” I answered and smiled back.  I was about to go back to my reading but he decided to sit down and join me.  I can see that he has difficulty while he’s near the fireplace but still he stayed.  My parents did not see anything wrong with the situation.  At their point of view it was just a friendly conversation with the guest of the house.  But I had this strange feeling that it was more than just a mere “friendly conversation”.  Marius was curious of how literate I was.  He kept asking questions on what I had read through the years or what languages I know.  He seems curious that at my age of sixteen, I know so many things.  In his eyes, he wasn’t only curious.  He knows I have a potential, but he is thinking on how to use it. As the night wore on, I told my parents that I would retire for the night.  It was still early from the usual time that I go to sleep but something inside of me said that I should leave the living room.  So I did.  It was the biggest mistake that I had made.  I was already in my room when it started.  Marius had planned the whole thing so that it would be easy to be put to action.  Marius attacked my parents when I left the room.  I didn’t even hear them scream.  But when I went down to get a glass of water, I found them.  Dead.  They were where they were sitting when I left the room but their head is tilted at a different angle and you can plainly see two puncture holes that can only be explained by vampire bites.  “Mother? Father?” I said, not believing that they are already dead.  “They cannot hear you anymore, Engkeli,” someone from behind me said.  I turned around to see Marius, not hiding his true nature anymore.  The evil being that has killed the people who took him in when he was injured. “How could you do this?” I asked in anger.  “They took you in.  They saved you from the people who attacked you.  They never did anything wrong.  Why did you have to kill them?”  Marius walked slowly towards me.  My anger was so intense that his presence did not disturb me like that time when he approached me near the fireplace.  When he was already at arm’s length, he said, “they were a hindrance.  They should not be the keepers of such a talented child such as you.”  “So you just killed them?” I remarked.  “Is that all they were to you?  Pawns in your game?”  “You can say that,” he answered.  “You can also say that I have saved you from the life that they have given you.”  “I love my life,” I said.  “You have no right to tell me what kind of life I should be leading.  You’re not my father.  You just killed him.”  “I have nothing to do with you, sir,” I continued to say.  “Kill me now.  So that I may join my parents in the afterlife.”  He laughed at my statement. He picked me up by the face with only one hand.  Oddly, his face was peaceful.  As if what he did, did not bother him in any way.  “I will not kill you, Engkeli,” he replied.  “You are gifted.  We must use that gift.  You will thank me when you realize what I say is right.” And then it was over.  I woke up the next night craving for blood.  I have become his childe.  I had become a vampire.    I was on my bed.  Marius was sitting in a chair right beside the bed.  Vampire blood boiled within me.  Anger and hatred for what I have become was seeping through my being.  I have no love lost for this monster.  But someday, I fill find a way to kill him.  It’s not impossible.  But it will be difficult.  I have read literatures that tells me of childes killing their sires.  I have to find a way.  I cannot live like this knowing the monster who slaughtered my parents have given me another life to live.  I will find a way.  But for now, he would regret the day he made me a vampire. ---------  This is the back story of my vampire character Engkeli.  I meant to write stories of her adventures before, I've finally got to do it now.  Now if I can only remember the stories that were written in that diskette...

       Never Trust a Product for Women That is Being Advertized by Men    They say that it's a guy's best friend...well, it's a nightmare for girls!     Yesterday was one of the most embarrasing day of my life.  Thank God I got a chance to fix it before it got any worse than it is and thank God that I saw it before anyone in the office noticed as well.   Anyway, this will be the last time I will listen to advertizing campaigns for women's products being presented by men.  Honestly, what do guys know about women's products anyway?  Especially when it concerns women's hygiene.  But it was also a mistake in my part to actually try the product because I thought it would be an inexpensive replacement of what I am using at the moment.  Boy was I wrong!!!  Anyway, I'm sorry guys if you don't understand what I'm trying to say or just going to ignore this post of mine.  But I really have to let this out.  If not for my sanity then as a warning to girls who will by this product (I hope you know what I'm talking about).  Anyway, I'll be going back to my usual blogs tomorrow.  Sorry about this blog though.

       Wishing for my Diskette back   In a previous blog, I mentioned a diskette where I have put all my blogs that I have yet to post here.  Those where blogs that are mostly stories, poems, songs and some sayings where I put my thoughts into.  But unfortunately, that diskette isn't here anymore.  Whatever is wrong with the diskette, I couldn't get things from there anymore.  It's really not fair.  Anyway, today is one of those days I wish I have my diskette back.  I'm a total blank right now so I really don't have anything to say.  Oh well. Maybe I'll get my creative juices to ooze again and I'll be able to rewrite the stories that I had finished writing before.

       Wonderful Yesterday...   Yesterday was one of those days that nothing was wrong.  Everything was in place and in order.  Nothing was wrong yesterday and I had a best time even though I lack sleep. =)  I met my old taekwondo professor yesterday and I got a chance to actually go back to training.  All I have to do is find the friggin' place where he teaches during Saturdays. =)  Not only that, I also got my last salary in Miriam without anyone knowing I was there.  I also got my blood pressure, my blood sugar and my blood type when I was walking at the walkway in Greenbelt.  Now I know that I'm my blood pressure is low, I'm type 'A', and my blood sugar is just right.  At least the reason for me not getting fat isn't because of the sugar intake that I make. =)  And I finally got to finish without any mistakes on the song that I have been trying to learn how to drum in the arcade.  Finally I've got 3 consecutive 'S' with no mistakes at all. =)  That is quite an achievement for me since it has been a long time since I haven't been playing the drums in the arcade. =)  And since I still have a hard time in coordinating my eyes and right foot, it was really an achievement for me, even if it was only "Ai Ni Shinoku".  My next drum "project" would be "Sakura No Toki" (I think that's what it's called).  All in all, I really had a great time yesterday. =)  I didn't get to think about bad things that much and my mind was well rested. =)  That is such an achievement for me as well since my mind has been buzzing with thoughts, ideas, images, stories and what nots. =)  Anyway, it's back to the real world for me. =) But the memory of wonderful yesterday would stick in my mind. =)

       THIS HAS GOT TO STOP   This issue has been here for more that a week already and it's getting out of hand.  People who aren't suppose to be involve are already being blamed for something that they don't even know about.  There are also people who don't know what's going on and keep butting in the issue as if they know what they're talking about.  Others are making it worse by keeping the issue alive.  And there are those who wants to get to the bottom of this so that we can close it up and live our lives again.  And as for me, I have said my side, I had a talk with Marc, he apologized about the incident and I'm already fine with that, though we will not get a beer together after a good day's work, I will be keeping a professional relationship with that guy.  I would really like to apologize if this has gotten out of hand.  I have this fear that I'm the one to blame for this issue to have gotten as huge as this.  It wasn't my intention though.  I wanted to let out my frustration against an arrogant and obnoxious office mate.  And I'm really sorry for actually opening my mouth and saying something in the first place.  Can I plead for temporary insanity?  I really don't want this issue to go on any longer.  I want it to stop and let everybody get on with their lives.  Anyway, I would really like to apologize for the blunder that I had done.  As I've said, it wasn't my intention to wage an all out war against members.  I just really hope that we can close this issue and be friends again.

       Just Some Clarification   I just want to clarify something about the blog entry I did yesterday.  So my dear friends who send me SMS, thanks for your concern but I'm alright now. =)  Yesterday was really bad.  But it was just a ranting of someone who was really mad at three power failures while she was on the computer doing her work.  Honestly, yesterday was really hell for me.  I didn't get to do my job well.  But that was yesterday.  With all the bad things happening to me all I need is a pen and paper (well in this case my blog) so that I can rant all I want and feel better afterwards.  It's just my way of releasing tension, stress, depression and anger.  I promise I'm fine now...There might still be some issues here and there but it's nothing I can't handle.  I can face these challenges now because I have a clearer mind.  Anyway, thank you people for your concerns.  It was well appreciated. =)

       Damn Stupid Power Failure   Since this morning I wasn't having a good day.  All my hard work editing the scripts needed for the Non-Playing Characters for this online gaming hasn't been paid off.  I  have saved for the nth time only to see that after the power surge, there was nothing there for me to go back to.  I have to start from scratch yet again.  This is not a very nice start of the week for me here at work.  I wouldn't have minded if it was only one time.  Twice is acceptable but three times!!!!!  That is too much already!  I'm sick and tired of looking at the same script that I have twiced edited only to see the same script again, not change after the lights went back up.  What is going on?!?  This is so not fair.  I do a good damn job trying to finish my work on time and this happens!!! It's really not fair!!! I don't deserve this!!!  Why does it always happend to me?  It's just isn't right anymore!!!  I have been taking crap ever since the start of the year...I guess even before that.  I don't know how long I will last if I keep on getting this type of crap over and over and over again.  I don't know what God wants with me.  He usually tells me these things.  Now I don't hear anything anymore.  It's not like I've turned to the dark side or anything.  Maybe I'm just so angry about my life that God just wants me to blow off some steam.  Well, whatever his plan is for me he'd better tell it...or maybe I'm just not listening...  Is it alright to be angry at God for all the bad things that has been happening to me over and over and over again?  I mean, I don't hate Him, I'm just a stubborn angry daughter who doesn't understand what he's been trying to tell me.  Have I been ignoring him or something that he just stopped trying to get through to me anymore?  Am I that evil in his eyes that he wants to teach me a lesson?  If there was some way...any way I can talk to Him...He used to send me signs...Am I just blind now to all the things that he wanted me to see?  I still don't get it?  I still can't see the point of me taking all this crap...  But I will not be beaten. If this is a challenge from the Big "G" himself then I'm up for that challenge.  I will not take this crap anymore.  If He's testing me, I'm ready.

       Another Reflection    "Size matters not...Look at me! Judge me by my size do you?" - Master Yoda, The Empire Strikes Back   In the world of Midgard, this saying has been ringing in my head one after the other.  I have encountered monsters that are smaller but are stronger and faster than me.  There are those whom you think are harmless and weak but end up being one of the strongest creatures there.  I have died trying to beat these monsters.  And I kept on trying to be stronger than them.  This is also applicable in real life.  We shouldn't judge someone just because they're smaller or seemed weaker because they do not seem the type of people who can take care of themselves.  I have seen big men cry because they were beaten up by a small man.  And I have seen silent types, take up a weapon and beat someone to a pulp.  I have seen small kids stand up against a class bully.  Size is not an element whether a person is strong or not.  I have been mistaken for a weak person myself.  Being a small and light person (people love carrying me around because of my lightness)  people tend to not take me seriously when I tell them that I would like to challenge them in a fight.  Though, there aren't many of them that I have fought against.  People that I did get to face tend to be bigger and so they think, stronger.  But in all those occasions, I'm proud to say that I beaten them in every possible way.  Honestly, I'm a little proud that I can beat up guys but I'm prouder if I can beat them up by words and witty remarks than brute force.  Kind of like Master Yoda. =)  Master Yoda is the strongerst Jedi I know.  Okay, he's not real but you learn a lot from him.  He did kick serious ass in Attack of The Clones and to think that he's just a small creature.  But he'd rather discuss everything first than beating the living daylights out of other people.  Anyway, my point is that never underestimate small people.  They might be just little and cute but they can be deadly as well.  So be sure to check otherwise, you might get into serious trouble and end up crying in the end. =)

       Tonight is one of those nights   It's that time of night where you really want to get some sleep already but things that aren't in your control happens and you find yourself awake and working.  Yup.  It's one of those nights.  But this will be the first time I will be working like this.  As much as I love my job right now, I don't think that I would be doing this again anytime soon.  It's just those 'it-can't-be-helped' kind of things.  But even if the night is like this.  I'm glad I have a friend with me who can keep me awake.  I hope that I would be able to have fun despite the tiredness and sleepiness that I am feeling right now.  But I'm thinking, at the end of the day (or night as the case may be) I would be doing something that my friends would envy (those playing Ragnarok that is).  Anyway, I have to get going. =)  Have fun in your end! =)

       Knowing Who Your Real Friends Are...   First, I would like to apologize for not writing last Saturday to Monday.  Our computer at home died and I had no means of going online except wait for the day that I would go back to this office and do the things that I need to do on the net.  Anyway, to the topic at hand...  Last Saturday, I had finally released all the pent up sorrow, stress and anxiety.  All it took was another Saturday of not playing RPG.  =)  You see, playing table-top gaming is the only way I release my emotions...well that and drums.  But I was actually touched by what my friends did.  I was planning to leave early since I know that I wouldn't be doing anything but watch them play so I just told them that I'll just go home.  While explaining to  Jay   the reason why I would just go home that day, I suddenly burst into tears.  What really touched my heart was that they didn't judge my actions.  They didn't think that it was really childish of me to suddenly burst into tears (which I know that it was) all because I wouldn't be able to play.  Instead, they sought out the real reason why I suddenly cried.  They were there for me to give me comfort even though they know that what they are telling me won't reach me as soon as they wanted to be.  They were very understanding and respected my feelings.  They did everything they can to make me feel better.  And because of them, I still had a good time despite my first outburst.  I was really greatful that I have friends like Jay and Kate.  I am lucky to have friends like them.  In contrast to what happend to me last Saturday, Sunday was something different entirely...  The coup d'etat in Makati made me work at home that Sunday.  But before I actually worked at home, I went to the office because I thought that last night was already over.  After seeing a tank parked in Edsa and in Ayala Avenue, newscrew from different channels were pointing their cameras at the rooftop of Glorietta, police and military were starting to make a perimeter reaching my office building, and seeing 4 people on top of the rooftop of Glorietta, well I decided to go home and do my job there instead of teasing death to take me.  I was sleepy and tired when I reached home but I still did my job.  At around 12nn, I logged off the computer, typed my report, ate lunch and went to bed.  I need more sleep than the 2hours I had that day since the night before, I stayed with my barkada at  urlLink Kate's   place because we already heard from Alex that there is a coup attempt.  So, my friends in fear of me going home on my own, told me to come with them.  I had fun that night even though the reason why I was there was because of the coup attempt.  Though I really need sleep badly.  Anyway, I was sleeping when one of my high school friends texted me.  When he didn't get an answer quickly, he decided to call me and told me that he and Lea was on their way to SM Southmall and they want to hang out.  I told them that I needed sleep.  I told them I was tired and that I only had 2 hours of sleep the night before.  He just said, "Basta, bumangon ka na dyan at nasa Casimiro na kami."  I ignored his remark and went back to sleep only to wake up again 15 minutes later because Lea called and said that they were already in Southmall.  She told me that the whole group was there and was expecting me to get there as soon as possible as well.  I again explained that I really needed sleep.  But she insisted of me coming because everyone was there and gave names of some people who were supposedly there already.  I said to give me five minutes to decide and wake myself up in which she just laughed.  I tried calling some friends who were supposedly there already only to find out that they didn't even get a call from Lea and Rocky.  I was really pissed off after I heard that.  I sent and SMS message to them saying that I can't go because I'm really tired and I wasn't allowed to go out of the house.  Now I find myself comparing friends.  On the one side, people who I just met during last 2 years in college and on the other side my highschool friends who were with me in my choir days in fourth year high school.  The funny thing is, the people who knows me more are the people who I am with for a shorter time.  Jay only need to look at me to know that there is something wrong.  While Lea would still be clueless to what I feel eventhough the voice indicates that I'm already annoyed or pissed off already.  I guess I know who my real friends are.  The length of time that you know them isn't the indicator whether or not they are the best people to be with or not.  With my high school friends, there would always be a hidden agenda if they help me out with something.  They wouldn't call, text, email or even say hi in the Yahoo Messenger.  Countless times I have tried to get us together and they would always have an excuse not to go.  But they expect me to be there at their beckon call if they were the ones who's asking for a get together.  When I needed someone to talk to, they wouldn't be there for me.  I guess they were the reason why I am still having a hard time opening up to Jay, Kate and the others.  No one was there to listen to me back in highschool since my best friend left the country during those times.  And if they did listen to me, they would find someway to make it about them.  Lea is notorious for that.  When I try to tell her something, she would cut me off and tell something about her problems and trouble.  I would end up cheering her up in the end.  But the worst insult that I got from them was when they told me that RPG was just a waste of time.  It was something very childish and I should just hang out with them than me going to Greenbelt and play.  I guess that made up my mind of who I really want to call my friends.  I don't know.  I guess that made me fed up with them.  I mean, if they're my real friends, even if they don't appreciate playing RPG the least they can do was just respect my decision.  Well, I guess that I know who my real friends are.  I only regret finding it out just recently when the fact is that since first year in college, I know that I have friends in Jay, Becca, Kate and the rest of the people in the tambayan.  All the indicators were there but I was just ignoring it.  Something bad has to happen to me first before I realize what was there all along.  I apologize to my friends (JAY, KATE, NICCO, BECCA, GLENN, ARMAND, VICTOR, VINCE, SASHA, ZSAR, GINO, CARL, JANSSEN, CHRISTINE DALLAND, ADRIAN, ELLIE, ALEX, CHRISTINE and LENARD).  You guys have been very good to me and I just turned a blind eye just until recently.  I hope you can forgive me for being blind.  I promise to be a better friend to you this time around.

       This Is Something You Don’t Get To See Everyday      Funny, isn’t it?  People have a wicked way of seeing things.  Honestly, it’s funny how people view problems and troubles the wrong way and when someone sees it the same way as them, they would wonder as well.  I guess, we can’t please ourselves even if we tried.  It might be possible but there would still be this feeling that it won’t be enough or not right in the picture.

       Some more tests...   Here I go again...  I was surfing the net and I went to my friend  Jay's    blog site.  And here I am posting my result of the test he had posted there.    Your from clan Ventrue - Old-fashioned and tradition-bound, the Ventrue are sophisticated and genteel. They believe in good taste above all else and work hard to make their lives comfortable. They are most frequently the leaders in the Camarilla, and are cautious, honorable, social and elegant Kindred.    urlLink   What Vampire the Masquerade clan are you from?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     That's really odd...I was hoping to still be Brujah but I guess being a Ventrue is fine as well.     You are a member of the Celestial Chorus, or a "Chorister".  While others may dismiss you as a fundamentalist freak, or preachy conservative, you have conviction in your soul that cannot be broken, a certainty in your faith.  You know that your way is right, for when you feel the song inside, it is beautiful and unifying, drawing all of creation together.  Of course, being a mage of this Tradition means you must exterminate those who would disrupt humanity's rise to divinity.  And like any fanatic, yours is a righteous wrath.    urlLink   Which Tradition Mage Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     This can't be right...

       Disappointing in the End   Yesterday was pretty interesting for me emotion wise.  I have been happy, sad, sleepy, moody and disappointed all on the same day but not at the same time.  But it was an really interesting day nonetheless.  I was happy... Finally in Ragnarok, my friends and I finally got our guild up.  Now, all we have to do is gather enough experience to level up so that we can help the newbies that play in the game.   The guild was designed for this.  The reason why we build the guild was to help out newbies level-up in the game.  So that they wouldn't be cheated by other people who would want to cheat them as they progress along the way.  It was pretty amazing too since it was like a hive mind.  The next thing I know we would be saying "We are the Borg..." because I get to communicate with them everywhere I go.  But it's really great to know who's there and who isn't.  I was moody... The afternoon went on and I was a little moody when I was with my aunt.  I love her, don't get me wrong but the fact that she acts that she thinks she knows everything really annoys me.  I was moody that time I was with her.  I was saying one-liners and pretend that I don't hear her sometimes.  It was a good thing that when that play that she invited me started, she was quiet and didn't pay attention to me....until the play ended and she was saying over and over and over again that the play was good.  Don't get me wrong, the play was fantastic.  I even got the signatures off all the actors of the play and I didn't regret watching it but I guess I would have loved it more if I was with my siblings or my friends.  Anyway, my aunt and I got separated when I went to get the actors' autographs.  I did look for them but was feeling relieved when I didn't.  I just texted her to say that I went home already.  I was sleepy... Yes, even now I lack sleep and my body is screaming for it.  But I guess I have to live with the fact that I need to get use to it if I don't want to change my work schedule.  I'm sad.... Because I watched the play last night, I didn't get to watch Formula 1.  Even if I did enjoy the play, I kept wondering what has been happening with the race.  Then I was disappointed... When I asked my sister what happened in the race, I was disappointed.  Both the drivers that I was cheering for didn't even pass the first corner.  It was Ralf Schumacher's fault...to my total disbelief.  And because of that Kimi Raikkonen did not finish the race again, giving Michael Schumacher a nine point lead, making him take the third in the driver's champoinship and letting Montoya get second.  And Kimi was looking forward for a good race.  I was really disappointed that dispite the fact that I didn't get to watch the race, I didn't watch the replay of it when it was shown on TV this morning.  But I really hope and pray that Kimi would eventually get back on his feet and start winning podium again.  And I hope and pray that he wins WC.  It won't be that great if he wins it next year.  I do not want Montoya to win before him as well.  I would rather see Michael Schumacher win it yet again than the Columbian driver.  Oh well, we can't have everything can we?  Maybe I get to be happy tomorrow.  But today, I'm happy and exhuausted as well as sad...  I'm sad today because... I can't play Ragnarok at home...not yet anyway.  There's something wrong with the patch I think and I really don't know why it won't connect to the patch.  I hope they fix it so that I can use the computer here at home to play the game.

       My Younger Brother, My Hero   As I pity my younger brother for waking him up at 5am just to accompany me because of the neighbor's dog, I find myself having new respect for him as well.  As I have said in the previous blog, he can be annoying and most of the time forgets that I'm older than him.  But when you really need him, he pulls through.  But what made me respect him more as a person and a brother is his way of protecting us.  And it's really refreshing to know that you can count on him whenever you need him.  Another thing I really admire about my brother is his talent for learning martial arts or learning how to use a certain weapon without anyone teaching him or him reading anything about that weapon.  He learns by watching people in their training and copy what they do.  And what's great about it is that he can follow them without difficulty.  I remember him when he was just 10years old.  I used to see  him in our garden, carving a piece of wood and shaping it into a sword.  I used to spar with him before and instead of me teaching him the ropes being older, I was the one who's learning from him.  I also rember him rummaging through the garbage that he have and scavanging for two pieces of wood that's was used as a handle for the broom that we have and an old dog chain.  In the garden he's trying to fix it and make it into a "chako".  And like before, he only learned to use it on his own.  I see him swing those things around afraid that he might hit someone or break the sliding door of the house but he never did.  And just a few days ago after so long of not seeing him use that weapon, he made a demonstration in his room.  And I was honestly wide eyed and shock how he can twirl that weapon around, doing exhibitions that I haven't seen him done before, throwing it high behind his back only to catch it again in front without any difficulty.  I honestly forgot he can do those things until he showed it to me again.  I have a very amazing younger brother.  A deadly weapon to reckon with so I now refrain from pissing him off though knowing that he won't hurt me, I'll stay on the safe side.  But at least now I know who I need to go to if I need someone beaten up badly.  I have two brothers who can do it for me.  I'm so happy I'm blessed with siblings like them. =D

       Another Song   This song is another timely song for me...well not actually for me but to two people who means a lot to me.  You know who you are.  I hope you like it. =)   If My Tears Could Bring You Back   How will I start To marvel without you here You're star will guild me Lonely answers disappear  Is it too late? Are you too far gone to stay? Distance forever Should never have to go away  What will do? You know I'm only half without you How will I make it through?  Chorus: If only tears could bring you back to me If only love could find a way What I would do What I would give if you Return to me, someday somehow, somewhere If my tear could bring you back to me  I'd cried you an ocean If you sail on home again Waves of emotion Will carry you and all they can  Just let love guild you And your heart will chart the course Soon you'll be drifting To the arms of your true North  Look in my eyes You'll see a million tears have gone by But still they're not dry  (repeat chorus)  I hold you close And shout the words I've only whispered before For one more chance For one last dance There's nothing I would not endure  (repeat chorus)

       That's What Younger Brothers Are For   Sometimes when I 'm on my way to work, I encounter my neighbors dogs outside their house without a leash and are free to roam around the street without any people guarding them.  It would have been fine if the dogs have their rabies shots already and they just walk around the place not trying to scare people all the time.  But the problem is that they aren't those dogs who wouldn't bother you if you don't bother them.  They're these dogs who would back at you and really try to scare you by coming very close to biting range and bark with all their heart and torment you on your way to work.  I hate these dogs and since I've started working here, they have been my constant ruiners of the day...though they do manage to really wake me up in the morning.  But I've had enough of these dogs.  We have already told our neighbor about it and they said that they will take care of it.  But the thing is they would take care of it and after a week, the dogs are out yet again.  We already told our neighbor twice about the situation and yet this morning, the dogs are still outside their house barking as usual.  Hence the reason I called for back-up.  My poor younger brother.  I have to wake him up at 5am so that he would accompany me to the main avenue of our street so that I can get a tricycle to go to work.  And arming himself with a staff, he went out with me to face those dogs.  He might be younger than me but he's really very protective of me and my older sister.  Even with groggy eyes and half-sleeping body, he was shielding me from the barking dogs and scaring them with his staff by banging it into the aspalt.  The dogs didn't even come ten feet from us.  This made me think how important my younger brother is to me.  He might be annoying sometimes and most of the time forgets that I'm older than him but when I really need him the most, he pulls through for me.  I really am happy that he is my brother.  I wouldn't ask for anyone else. =)  I guess, now that he's protecting me from the evil dogs that lurks during the daytime, I have to be extra nice to him.  He really is something when he's being protective and all. =)  I'm really happy that he's my younger brother. =)

       Wonderful World Of Day Offs   At first, when I took this job I have always wanted a day-off on a weekend.  One of the reasons is that I want to have ample time with my siblings and grandmother who are the only people I consider family since both my parents are in abroad.  But I find myself liking Monday's day-off the best time as any for one.  Today, I got my well deserved sleep.  I got 14hours of sleep and when I woke up I felt really refreshed.  All the lack of sleep that I have for the whole week, I got it back in just one day.  That is really something for me.  I have the energy that I need for the whole week again and that's no easy feat.  If my day-off was on a weekend, I wouldn't get to sleep like this because I go out on Saturdays and I go to church early Sunday morning and I can't go back to sleep after that.  I have to the computer all to myself.  If I had a day-off on a weekend, I have to battle out with the rest of my siblings for the use of the PC.  And unfortunately, I would lose.  On a Monday, everybody is out and I have the computer all to myself.  And that is something I can't do on a weekend.  Though I can't watch the programs that I watch during the weekends like Card Captor Sakura, Mutant X, Sinbad and StarGate, the wonderful world of technology has the answer to that as well.  I get to watch it all on my day off without anyone to bother me since I am the only one at home with my grandmother and with 3 TVs I won't have to worry about shooing her of the living room TV.  Ah... day-offs are really nice!  I'm so happy that I didn't get to convince my boss for Sunday's off.

       Greetings! and a Little Bit of Reminiscing   Anyway, I would also like to greet  urlLink Alex    Belated Happy Birthday!  We had dinner last night in honor of him and played Citadel until 11:45pm.  Needless to say that I am a little sleepy today at work but that's alright. I'll just try to sleep all day tomorrow. =)  It was a very wonderful evening and I enjoyed every moment of it though it would have been better if I actually played RPG.  I miss playing RPG.  But I can't blame my game master for not holding a game for us.  Everyone's been busy and I guess thinking of an appropriate game to hold for us isn't on the top priority.  I can't even hold my Aberrant game to them as well.  I have been swamped with paperwork, and with the current emotional state that I am in I can't think of a great game to hold for them.  Though, I have a game ready for them, it's just putting the new people in and trying to make them at least enjoy what I'm holding.  Hmm...maybe I'll try holding a game on Saturday. =)

       Sentimental?  Yeah...maybe...   On my way to work, I checked the CD collection of my sister so that I can bring a different kind of music in the office.  Well, I think I'm bringing out the sentimental side in me and took the second album of Westlife.  And as I am listening to it at the moment (to my friend Christine's distaste =D) I found this song that is to me very appropriate to the state that I am in at the moment.   LONELINESS KNOWS ME BY NAME by Westlife   Loneliness is always looking for a friend It found me once and it has been around since then Loneliness is never waiting by the door It sweeps right through and it will never be ignored Why, why was I chosen? Why am I left without?  CHORUS: The love of my life The love that I need The love that they say is in life for free The love of my dreams The love that I want Loneliness knows me by name  Loneliness knows everything I keep inside My endless thoughts in the silence of the night Loneliness is the one who made me see Ain't nobody else who can make a change but me Why, why was I chosen? Why am I left without? (Repeat Chorus)  Less is more and that would be vacant space The cried out tears and a never ending maze I have found what only loneliness provides A strength within knowing I will find (Repeat Chorus 2x)

       Another Song   This song is something I've heard from a Teen TV Series "California Dreams".  It's was a show about a group of friends that has a band and wanted to be recognized by the media.  I stopped watching when my favorite character Matthew Garret played by Brent Gore left the series.  Anyway, this was my favorite song that was sung by the group.   Everybody's Got Someone   Maybe I'm crazy  But it seems like everyone's in love but me Now that you're not here  Maybe I wonder what I've said or done so wrong To make you leave I'm drowning in my tears  All my friends walking hand in hand Oh it makes it tough I can't understand why it's not us I can't believe we're not in love Not in love  Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone But me  I see the clock upon the wall And wondered where you are tonight Wondered who your'e with  I think about the time we had I want you now with all my might If I could make a wish  Now it seems I'm the only one With no one to care It hurts so bad it's just not fair Don't leave me hanging in the air In the air  Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone But me  And I've got to find a way To bring you back to me again someday And you'll never go away  Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone But me  Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone But me  Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone Everybody's got someone...

       Oops...I did it again   Here I go again.  I just couldn't seem to stop my big mouth from saying something that would actually has the potential to destroy a friendship.  What I thought was a way for me to fix things up, I ended up making it worse...yet again.  Why can't I seem to stop my big mouth from voicing out her opinions?  I know no matter how noble my intentions were, I just can't seem to stop being guilty of what's been happening to my friends.  Honestly, it wasn't my intention of breaking this group up.  Contrary to it, I wanted to actually fix things so that there wouldn't be tension in the group if we're together.  Instead I ended up with two different groups and the other group doesn't even talk to me anymore.  Though my intention was really a  noble one, without the hopes of becoming the hero of this little story, I only wanted these two factions to actually understand each other.  Contrary to what people think, I'm in the middle of this.  How can I chose?  When on the one side, my friends since college who has helped me out with everything and they never once judged me for my actions.  And on the other side, someone I actually gotten close to in just a small amount of time.  And to think that this person is a girl is a remarkable thing for me.  I was never close to my own gender, the only "girlfriend" I have is my older sister.  So, it really is a refreshing change to find people who are of the same gender and you actually get along with them.  Now, I might end up losing both because of this blunder that I had made.  So much for my supposedly heroic act. =(  If you would actually call it a heroic act.  There was this small wedge that wasn't visible before but because of me, I ended up making a huge ledge that separates one from another that's worlds apart.  For those who were affected. I'm really sorry.  My intention was purely for helping out both parties and not break them apart.  I thought I was actually helping out.  I didn't know that I would be the reason why it  got worse.

       Life Without You   In the black of night you see a car parked on top of the hill overlooking the small town of Everville.  It was raining really hard.  Two people were sitting along side each other in the front of the car.  Everything was silent.  The girl on the passenger seat was tear-streaked.  Her long straight hair covered her beautiful face and her tears were trickling down her cheeks uncontrollably and she didn’t care to wipe them off.  Her sobs where the only thing that was heard in the silent car.  The boy on the driver’s side was trying so hard not to look at the person beside him.  His hand was on the steering wheel.  His knuckles have become white from holding the wheel too hard.     “Please stop,” he finally said.  He slowly looked at the girl beside him.  The girl’s shoulders were shaking uncontrollably; still she did not stop crying.  “Emily…” he took his seatbelt off and faced his love.    As he inched closer to try and calm her down, Emily moved away, as far away from him as possible with the current situation they were in.  She took her seatbelt off and opened her side of the door.  She went out in the pouring rain not thinking of where she would be going and not caring that she was already soaking wet upon getting out of the car.  “Emily!” he cried out and went after her.  The rain was pouring hard outside the car.  The hill was completely dark; the only sources of light were the dimly lit houses and establishments in the town below.  Emily was walking aimlessly away from the car, not noticing her boyfriend was following her.  Finally he caught her and held her in the rain.  “Leave me alone, Richard!” she said.  Her tears were already blending with the rain as the huge drops hit her angelic face.  The pain in her eyes were still clearly seen even though it was dark on the hill.  “Isn’t that what you’ve wanted?  For me to leave you alone?”  “No,” Richard answered as he kept his grip on Emily. “That’s not it.”  “Then what is it then?” Emily struggled to release herself from his hold but failed.  “After everything that has happened to us?  Why the sudden change?”  “I told you – ” He started but was cut off.  “That you just woke up one morning and realized that you didn’t love me,” Emily finished off what he was about to say.  “What have I done wrong?  Why can’t you answer that simple question?”  “Can we just go back in the car?” Richard remarked, trying to calm her down but still failed to do so.  “You’ll get sick if we stay out here.”   “Why would you care?” Emily shouted finally freed from Richard’s grip.  “You don’t love me, remember.”  “You know, you’re acting like a child.” Richard said but suddenly bit his lower lip knowing the made a mistake in commenting.  “A child?” Emily remarked.  “I am acting like a child? Is that it?  You don’t love me because I’m acting childish all the time?”  “No, okay,” he answered, not knowing what else to say.  “It’s not the reason.”  “Then what is it then?” she asked.    “I don’t know, Emily,” Richard replied not looking at her eyes.  “I just felt like it was time.”  “What have I done wrong?” she shouted to him.  “I have done everything you wanted me to become.  I even took the job you wanted me to take and not the one I wanted so much to do since I was a child.  I gave up everything for you.  Was there something that I didn’t do that didn’t please you?  What have I done for you to stop loving me?  You keep on telling me there isn’t someone else but I can’t see a reason why you will stop loving me.  Not unless…”  Emily paused and looked at the man she loved for five straight years.  The only person who had the courage and the patience enough to change her tomboyish attitude and actually got through to the hardened exterior of Emily was standing right in front of her now also drench in the rain that kept on pouring hard on the two lovers.  Richard did everything he can to change her.  Even putting up with everything that she did but it wasn’t love that she saw in those eyes, it was something else.  She looked at him with love still in her eyes.  But realization finally hit her.  “You never did love me,” she finished off her sentence.  “Emily…” Richard started but again, Emily cut him off.  “You never did see me as a girlfriend but as your dead sister,” she remarked.  “You loved her so much that when she was gone, you looked for the closest thing to her.  And you found me.”  Richard stared at his beloved.  Not wanting to say anything that might hurt her even more.  Everything she just said tormented him for months but the answer to that question wasn’t simple.  He asked himself time and time again what Emily means to him.  Was it really true that he only was with her to ease the pain for the loss of his sister?  Did he really look for a replacement of his sister Rita because he missed her so much?  Still the answer evaded him.  He met Emily a year after Rita’s death.  There she was, a girl wearing clothes three sizes bigger than her, a baseball cap, jeans and rubber shoes bullying other boys that were bigger and stronger than her but still she manage to take them on without fear.   But despite the rough outer appearance he found that she was really a nice and simple girl.  Emily intrigued him so much that he wouldn’t stop thinking of her.  He knew he liked her and he started to pursue her.  It had been six years after that first meeting.  Emily indeed changed from that rough and gruff girl he met to this lady standing right in front of him.  But the beautiful girl he knew he fell in love with was standing in the rain with him asking telling him that he never did love her.  And he knew that he’s hurting her even more by not rebutting her accusations.  But he knew that what Emily said wasn’t true.  He did love her, not the sisterly love that Emily is accusing him of but the love that only a man can give to a woman.  But his confusion about his own life made him think that he didn’t love her anymore.  Now seeing the woman of his dreams drenched in the rain and her own tears, he knew that he loved her still.  His own insecurities just blinded him with the truth.  He knew what to do and what to say.  Richard silence made Emily thought that she was right.  She dropped down on the ground and cried her heart out.  She couldn’t believe what was happening to their relationship.  Everything was perfect.  She didn’t know what happened or even why it happened that suddenly the love of her life, the only person she fell in love with that has changed her life would suddenly tell her that he didn’t love her.  She felt someone enclosed her in a tight embrace.  “Stop crying, Emily,” Richard said softly while holding her.  “Please, stop crying.  You know how much it pains me to see you cry.”  “Do you really miss Rita that much?”  “I miss her, yes,” he answered slowly, carefully choosing the words that would make things right again.  “But the reason I fell in love you was not because of her.  You two are two very different persons and I love you for you not because of her.  “There are just some things that confuses and scares me now.  I feel that I can’t protect like before.  And I want to keep on protecting you but with the situation that we’re in right now, I don’t think I can.”  “Don’t leave me, Richard,” Emily remarked, returning his embrace with all the strength she could give.  She started rambling without a care in the world.  “I’ll do anything you tell me to, just don’t leave me.  I’m sorry if I’ve done something that you don’t like.  I promise I’ll be better.”  “You’ve done nothing wrong,” he answered.  He softly kissed Emily’s forehead to calm her down.  “But how can you keep on loving me knowing that I can’t give you what you want anymore?”  “I don’t care about those things,” she replied.  “All I care about is you.”  He kissed her then.  A kiss that renewed everything they have.  He kissed her with all the love he could offer her.  And as the rain kept on pouring down on the two couple up in the hill, a light has found a way to their hearts.   My first pathetic attempt to write a love story.  I know it's really pathetic, kinda makes me wonder why I posted it in the first place.  Anyway, feel free to post your comment good or bad (bad is better so I know what to do to fix it.)  Either at the comment or at the tagboard.  Thanks very much!!!

       Stop, Look, and Listen   Proud as I am that I have gotten the courage to use what little knowledge my younger brother has taught me in using a chako and beaten the dogs that haunt my mornings, this is not the blog for that.  Instead, this blog is for nature and how wonderful it is to be alive.  Despite the rain on my way to work, I find myself very amused with the sight that befell me.  It was really amazing. In the rain, I saw creatures that I won't rarely see except in the province.  But it was really great to see them crawling in the sidewalks of the busy street of Makati.  I saw two snails, a worm and a centipede (not to mention the driving monkey that I got to glance up on my way to work).  As I've said, I've never get to see those things often.  And usually people just pass them by or worse step on them as they trudge along minding their own business not caring that they took a life.  I hate to think that we usually take these things for granted.  Who would have thought that the smaller snail can move faster than the bigger snail?  I know you don't care about these things because who would care to know that before you even try to step on a centipede it would already curl up into a spiral so that it won't get hurt when you step on it?  Life isn't always about the money we earn, the bills to pay, the gimiks that we spent with our friends and family.  With the fast pace world that we are in right now, we forget to stop and smell the flowers that is on the path beautifying your surroundings.    With all the problems that I had been facing (most of which was because of my own mistakes) I forgot the real meaning of living.  We tend to forget that a seven year old is living better in life just having the minimalist things and he's happy with that little toy that he's holding.  I know life won't ever be that simple.  But if we stop and look at life or how other creatures live their lives, we might see the beauty of things and of how God created the world (provided you believe in a higher being).  Then, looking at the wonders around us, even with all the complications life brings us, we know that it's alright because there is something wonderful around us that makes it all worth while.

       And Who Said That Nothing's Free Anymore?   After the long hour of trying to fix my bank account and the other errands my grandmother wanted me to do for the day, I was rewarded by the fact the there are still things that are free...if you have the reward card. =)  National Bookstore will forever be my favorite bookstore where I will be buying all the school and office supplies that I need.  And with their introduction of the "Laking National Bookstore Card", I was liking it even more.  As I amuse myself in the long line of National because the person in front of me bought a lot of books that took the time of every single cashier and bagger, I got to chat with the other cashier lady and ask her about the priviledges of the reward card that they offer.  And unlike other reward cards where the amount or points would give you this specific item, the Laking National's E-Purse would let you chose the item of your choice and let you buy it then and there.  And if the amount in the E-Purse if larger than the price of the item that you want, you can purchase it for free and you can still use the rest on your next visit.  It's really cool actually.  Call it childish but with the current financial problems that I have at the moment, this afternoon's purchase was really took a load off for me.  It was really well appreciate it.  So, who said that nothing is free anymore?  I may not have bought a house or a car but with the little freebie in life, I will more likely survive this world. =D

       New Sayings    "But I'm ready to fight, I've conquered my fear.  Now, if it kills me, you will lose." - Terry Bogard, Fatal Fury II   This was what Terry Bogard said after recovering from losing to Wolfgang Krauser.  At that time, he was really down and out.  He wasn't even listening to his own brother.  But the courage of one kid really helped him out of his depression and eventually went back to his old self again.  I just have this strange feeling that it actually applies to me.  But at the moment, I really don't think that I'm at that point where I can shout out those words.  I guess I'm still in the drunk in despare stage where Terry was before.  Terry Bogard.  Such a strong man, in physical, emotional, and intellectual aspects.  But I guess, he has suffered enough to know the pain.  Anyway, I would want to become Terry.  I want to be ready to fight and conquer my fear.  I want to shout to all who opposes me that they will lose.  That they are wrong to underestimate me.  I'm sleepy today.  So, I'm going to go to sleep soon when I get home from work.  I guess my conquering my fear would start when I wake up later. =)

       Scorpions Are A Misunderstood Clan   I've just finished reading Legend of the Five Rings novel, Clan War First Scroll: The Scorpion.  And honestly speaking as I've been reading the book, I have felt like they have been very misunderstood.  In RPG, I usually play a Scorpion.  I once played a scorpion shugenja with Bentem's Blessing.  I never gotten to play that character much but she has become an NPC with some friends of mine.  She's really cunning and very manipulative...not to mention seductive as well. *snicker*  But I've also played a Clan Ronin.  Once a scorpion samurai whose daimyo had died in the heat of battle.  Since she was one of the most trusted guard of that daimyo, she should have committed sepulcre but she didn't.  Instead, she went out in search of her daimyo's killer.  Anyway, that was another character that I have never get to play much.  And I'm actually hoping to get to play her once more.  But going back to the book that I have read.  I really felt that the scorpion were the most powerful clan in all of Rokugan.  This isn't just because I play a scorpion when I play RPGs but as compared to other clans, they have a massive network of spies and they know everything there is to know about Rokugan.  And plus the fact that they are very loyal to Rokugan unlike all the other clans.  They are skilled diplomats and also skilled fighters.  You can't lose whether they are in the battle field or having a debate in court.  They are the only clans who would want to associate with Ninjas.  And since I am a lover of those masters of the stealth, I really admire a clan who sees them as allies rather than enemies.  Heck they have one main enemy, Fu Leng. I don't see why they still need to fight each other like what the other clans are doing.  And while other clans destroy each other with their petty squabbles, the Scorpions watch and wait, ready to strike.  Like the real scorpion who seems harmless and vulnerable because they're small, so does the Scorpion clan seems a triffle to the other clans for being cunning and deceitful.  But the scorpion holds his true power upright.  It's tail is very poisonous and deadly.  The Scorpion Clan is the same in principle.  They do not show their real strength hide their real sting with the information they gather against the person.    *sigh*  After reading the book, I'm actually glad I played a scorpion when I play RPG.  It might not what my real personality is but it sure is good to actually try to play the manipulative, secretive, yet powerful clan.  And yet, I wonder why they are considered evil by other clans.  Just because they are good at getting all the dirt about you doesn't mean that they are really evil.  Detectives do the investigating and also get dirt about different people and they don't actually become the bad guys...so why does a scorpion considered evil just because they know what you do, where you do it and how you do it?  It's just not fair.  And everything that this clan does if for the good of the empire.  So, why is it that they are considered the evil people when all they wanted was to have a peaceful empire free from Fu Leng?  Well, I guess this will be a question that would be answered when I actually finish off all the books.

       Poetry in Motion   It's just one of those times that I feel so depressed and lonely for one reason or another.  But there are times when I just couldn't share it with anyone so I have to be cryptic about it.  The only person I can clearly talk to and share everything about my life isn't here.  So, a poem would have to suffice to the readers of this blog.  Not my best work but I only did it in a span of 5 minutes.    Loneliness    Darkness... Lost in a space in time Alone, blind and cold Searching but nothing to find  Alone... Deserted No feeling at all Just the numbness of the cold  Alone... Searching around in a troubled world No one to turn No where to go  Numbness... The cold is coming Enveloping my body Tearing in my soul  Reaching... Trying to hold on To something solid But only found open space  I am alone I have nothing I have no one I am empty  Nowhere to go No one to go to Lost in oblivion Forever condemned to eternal damnation

       And It Keeps Getting Worse Everyday   I have been to the bottom of this hell hole and I have seen the core.  I have been suffering a lot and I for one has had enough of it.  So when I thought that finally I am now able to climb back up to the surface, fate has something different instored for me.  I find myself slipping back down the bottom and the foot and hand holds that I had previously found on my way up has disappeared.  Now, let me see... the job that I am in right now has been on the rocks lately, I have been bypass in a promotion, I don't see my friends anymore, and I still have financial worries despite the help my friend Jay gave me.  To top it all off, I don't get to play RPG that regularly anymore.  And I have this strange feeling that my GM doesn't want to GM me anymore.  Though, I don't blame him, GMing is hard work.  And I guess, he wants to play as well which he doesn't get to do since he's holding the game.  Some sacrifices must be made to please others.  And though I feel some recentment because I don't get to play with the usual people that I use to play with, still I consider them my friends despite it all.  I just wanted to know why I don't get invited to their games anymore though.  No offense to Christine, I really like playing with her but I miss playing with the people who gave me the reason to play.  I miss playing with the original group who helped me out when I was just learning the world of RPG.  But with those people gone, I feel abandoned and set aside like a piece of meat.  And with everything happening to me right now, that is not a good feeling.  Well, they have their reasons.  Though, I wish that they would tell me those reasons.  Speaking of which, I have yet to muster my courage and talk to my boss why I was bypass in a promotion that I know in my heart that should have been for me.  I am qualified for the job than the people who took the spot that was suppose to be mine.  Heck, when I was doing my job, they were doing something else very different from the supposed job description.  They're not even working most of the time.  But since this is all over and done with, I will just accept the fact that I was bypassed.  Though, I would really like to know why.   I am sick and tired of all this.  Though one solution is coming to  mind, fate yet again has some funny way of telling me that it's a bad idea.  Killing myself is not a solution to the problems that I am facing.  And with that knowledge, I have to think of another way out of this.  Dang! it's hard but I have to at least try.

       A Bit Melodramatic...   For the passed few weeks or months...I'm not really sure now, I have yet to genuinely smile.  I don't know...I guess I have been bogged down with so many problems that I myself put upon myself that I can't actually blame other people for what has been hapening to me and  my life.  I miss smiling.  Well, I do get to smile but it not as real as I use to do back when I was in college for example.  Friends tell me that I have a natual smiling face that it would really be odd if they don't see me smile that day.  But now, I really don't see myself in that way.  I smile, yes it's true.  Some people would still see the off-white teeth that I have in occasion.  They might even hear a giggle or two coming from me.  But to people who doesn't know me that well, it would be a natural thing.  But for friends who knows me all too well, they know that there is something bothering me.  The thing is, I don't really know what's bothering me.  I guess the problems that I have, however I want to be unaffected by it really is affecting me very much.  But this really needs to stop.  I really don't like this facade of smiles but on the inside is the total opposite.  A smile.  Just one smile is all I need for myself.  I wish one day, I can achieve that.

       Friends   Last Saturday I have been both unfortunate and fortunate to have experience another of my Heart attacks.  It was both a blessing and a curse.  Upon coming back to my doctor this afternoon, they told me that it had gotten worse.  How much worse, I have yet to know when my mother gets here.  On the brighter side of things, I was lucky enough to have survived all of this.  And with everything that has been happening to my life, I saw a gleam of hope.  I have friends.  They say that it's really hard to get good friends these days.  I have experience how it feels like to be on the receiving end of people who I treated as friends and all they ever did to me was only used me for their own purposes.  I had once before lost hope and closed my mind to the possibility that I will be forever alone in this world.  People who I thought I could trust only toyed with my emotions leaving me alone and unfeeling.  Last Saturday changed everything.  I have friends.  Friends who were there for me if not physically then in spirit.  I never thought that having this heart ailment would bring me closer to my real friends.  I feel blessed knowing that they are there to rush to my side when bad things happened to me.  When I was rushed to the hospital, their friendly faces were the ones that kept me strong.  They helped out through the pain and they did everything they could so that I won't worry about things.  They were there for me waiting.  Dropping everything they were doing just to come and help me out.  Honestly, I really don't know how I can thank them.  Words cannot express how much I appreciate having them in my life.  I don't know where I would be without them with me.  My life is a little bleak.  But I can see a dim light ahead of me.  I hear voices cheering me on so that I can pass through this dark forest.  I won't get lost anymore, I have friends who are cheering me on.  THANKS GUYS!!!

       Cotton Candy Cure...   For days I have been hunting high and low for those candy clouds that I love so much.  I was really saddened by the fact that I coudn't find it anywhere in Makati.  For weeks, I have asked my office mates and friends to buy me one if they get a change to find a stall along the way to work or to our meeting place but for days and weeks, they come out empty handed.  I couldn't get the cotton candy that I wanted.  Then, a miracle.  And it was really just about time too, that I've stumbled upon a cotton candy stall on the way home.  Though now I couldn't eat cotton candy while playing RPG.  At least when I go home and feeling down and wanted so bad to stangle someone, I get a chance to calm myself down or try to be too hyper not to think of the awful day that happened today.  Okay, it wasn't that awful.  Because, we didn't actually do anything today since the emails that I got to answer were only 20 all in all.  But an incident at work really made my blood boil.  What's really annoying is that it wasn't the guy that all of us hate.  It was the lovable know-it-all in the group.  And as I look at it closer, I know that it's only hormones that has got me into this boiling point.  But at the moment, the thing he said really hurt me so much.  And I've decided that I will not talk to him until he apoligize to me.  I know, it's childish...but still I got hurt.  All the planning, all the time that I have spent convincing my boss for a night out...it won't be fun if we're missing one person.  I don't see why he couldn't see that.  Anyway, I guess the huge cotton candy that I ate to calm my nerves is already digesting because my blood has started to boil again just remembering the incident.  The look on my office mate's face just makes me want to punch him (even though he has glasses on)  just so that I can wipe that smirk off his face.  Damn him if he watches a movie tomorrow!!!!  Anyway, cotton candy.  The only reason I haven't trashed our computer yet is because of this gift from the heaven.  That soft pink puff of cloud has really calms the nerves and numbs the tongue for too much sugar, really is heaven sent.  I guess, I wouldn't be writing here now if I didn't get to see that small stall inside SouthMall.  I would be in a foul mood, pretending that everyone is against me, trying to think of a way to kill the guy who smirked at my face because he'd rather watch a movie that to spend a night out with us.

       Stress, stress and more stress   Honestly, after that wonderful weekend in Bicol, I thought that I would be strong enough to face anything.  Though, my other real reason of going to that province was put on hold (my "boyfriend" and I are back to "best friends" status) and  I can't do anything about it.  As for that concern, I'll just have to wait for fate to decide.  I'm still crossing my fingers and praying to every saints and angels to help me out with my love life...but the good thing about it is that he hasn't closed his door on us and I still might be able to get my wish.  Anyway, with that in my mind, I thought everything would be A-okay when I get back to work...whoa and behold...more stress.  I'm in HIS shift.  People who knows me would read this blog and understand.  The spawn of Satan has ruled over my mornings and I dread every single day that I go to work.  I guess the reason why I just keep silent even though I know that I have most of the workload is that I don't want him to think that I can't work.  I guess,  I want to be better than him, especially since he got the position that I know I deserved.  I just want to show people especially to my boss that he made the wrong move of chosing him instead of me.  But what can I do.  "I don't have the decision making skills that they were looking for."  Anyway, I know that the stress that I have is all my doing...and I know that I have to get pass this or else I would end up in the hospital again...which would lead me to either get fired because my health can't take it...which would give me more stress because I will have a hard time to go looking for a job again...and the cycle goes on.  Fear...I really hate that emotion.  And it's a path to the dark side as well.  But at the moment, I really don't know how to get pass this.  And this is giving me more stress...

       Getting Myself Together   Wow! It has been a long time since I've posted something here!  Where do I begin?  Let's start with what has happend to me for the passed week.  Last week was hell week for us all in the office and I really thought that I wouldn't be able to get pass all of the trials that they had given to us...I also thought that I was going to lose my job...Good thing that I still have it right now, with added responsibilities and added stress.  But the best part of that is I get to do what I want to do with my life...you can say that I have found my calling. =)  Well, for the passed week, we have been going through some major changes in the office.  I for one can understand what has been going on.  A company that is slowly growing needs to have these changes or else you won't see any progress...right?  But the thing that ticked me off was because we need to do these changes quickly and with a deadline or else we will find ourselves out of a job.  Anyway, last week was a week of sleeping over in the office or my friend Christine (she's also my office mate by the way) so that we would be able to finish what was needed to be done.  It was really hard...though most of the time you will be finding us laughing and kidding around in the office instead of doing the work that needed to be done.  Oh well, I'm happy that was over...but the challenging part is yet to come I'm afraid.  I was assigned to be the unofficial HR personel of out department...(thank God it's not the whole company)...and honestly speaking, I'm a bit frightened but it's a challenge... This is going to be a test of the things that I have learned in school...and though I know what to do in theory, I still have yet to understand what I need to do in practice...looking at people's resumes are hard enough without having a personal bias against the applicant...now what would happend if I get to talk to them face to face?  I'm really scared.  Picking the phone up and looking for them to schedule them for an interview is hard enough as it is... The only people I really get to talk to on the phone are my friends...and I make sure that they answer the phone before I call them up.  It is a misconception that I enjoy talking on the phone...on the contrary, the only person I want to spend hours talking to is my boyfriend, and that I only just wanted to listen to him breathing (yeah, yeah, it's corny I know but what can I say?  I'm inlove with the guy).  But the rest, I dread picking up the phone and talking to someone.  I don't even like talking to my parents on the phone...as much as I miss them, there is something about the phone that is scary (too much conspiracy theory movies if you ask me...hehehe).  Anyway, going back to my original train of thought...I am scared of this challenge that's put upon me but I have to do it...I love a good challenge, so why do I feel scared?  Well, being scared is natural...if I wasn't scared then there is something terribly wrong with me (as if there is nothing wrong with me already.... O_o).  But as I always say, being afraid is one thing but doing something about it makes all the difference.  So, with that said.  I'm going to smile and face the new day!  I'm going to let everybody think that I'm not scared of this responsibility.  I'm going to face them and give the best that I can with this new responsibility...I can do this... I will not be afraid, I will face this challenge and smile because I will be good at it, I will be the best they will get and with that I might get the job as HR Manager....(kapal talaga ng mukha mo Michelle...)  So, shall we dance?

       It's Quoting Time    "I will not Fear. Fear is the mind killer. I shall face my fear. I shall let it pass through me." -  Leto II, Children of Dune    I love that movie.  Children of Dune is the second installment of the movie "Dune".  Well, honestly started out as a novel with the same title "Dune" and was adapted in the movie.  "Children" focuses mostly on the twin children of Paul Atradis also known by the people of Arakas as Moa 'd ib.  As the children grew up learning to control the gift that they have inherited by birth from their families new challenges faced them.  But in the end, they have controlled their destinies and set everything right in the planet of Arakas.  Anyway, the quote that was mentioned is really ideal to what has been happening with my life right now.  With all the goings on in the company and so many things that changes all the time, it's really scary sometimes.  Espcially with my present state.  I am responsible for the choice of people coming in the company.  If I make a wrong decision, I'm in big trouble.  But fear can do that to you.  It eats you up and make you do things that you won't be able to think straight.  And as the saying goes, "Fear is the mind killer."  We need to face our fears and let it pass.  We will not overcome our fears if we don't face them and let it pass through us.  We will not be able to fix our lives if we have something to fear about.  In the story, Leto II didn't face his destiny until he faced his fear of the coming sand storm.  And with that, he overcame everything and was one with the planet that he needs to save.  We all have fears.  Some of us even become as worse as phobias.  But if we need to go forward to anything that we're planning on doing, we need to face what we most fear because once we've faced it and let it pass, we can overcome any challenges that comes to our path.

       Contemplating...   Training new people...Both satisfying and tiring...  It was a hell week for me.  I have passed through the gauntlet and survived.  What started out as a very stressful Monday turned out right in the end...or so I hoped...  The fact that my boss keeps forgeting important stuff, I have to run around the place trying to fix what could have been done earlier.  Stress was really at the peak and it was really surprising that I wasn't sent to the hospital a second time.    But the responsibility made me stronger.  And for all the wrong things my boss did, this is something good.  I've learned to be responsible for my work better than what I have been doing eversince I've started working for this company.  Don't get me wrong, I have been responsible.  But I have been responsible only for myself.  I never did care what's been going on around me.  All I was thinking was do my job and then go home...and that's that.  Then people started getting sick.  I think it's mostly because of the environment that we have right now...or maybe it's the weather since it is starting to get cold because Christmas is coming...but still there are some other factors going around like stress and over work.  In the kind of work that we're in, it's really hard not to worry.  Now I worry about my officemates whom some I treat as friends already.  And when I see that they're getting sick one by one I really worry about them so much.  That's when my human nature kicks in and be like the older sister to everyone around me even when I know I'm suffocating sometimes.  But that doesn't stop me from worrying...in fact, I worry more.  Everyday, things are changing.  And now that there are new people coming in, then there are new people I need to worry about.  Stress will definitely build up and I might end up in the hospital again...though I really hope that it won't happen to me.  Anyway, another week has passed and a new chapter of my life will begin.  I hope that this chapter will be a little bit stress free...wait...Christmas is coming...Oh boy...

       Just When I Thought...    Just when I thought that I have everything back together, another bad thing happened in my life. Just when I thought that I can have a normal life back, fate just laughs and kicks me in the ass. Just when I thought I am finally free from this prison I made, I seem to keep coming back to it again and again. Just when I thought that I can love again, he doesn't even know I'm here. Just when I thought that my life is changing, Just when I thought I have everything in control, Just when I thought I've finally found someone, Well, it was just a thought.   Hohum...yet again, the old saying, "Things Happen for a Reason."   That saying, has been bugging me for the passed few days...or weeks...or months...I can't remember now.  Life just seem to surprise me all the time.  Everything happens for a reason, or so they say.  But up to now, I can't seem to get the reason behind all of what's been happening in my life.  It's really not something I can understand, though they say that it's a simple fact of life.  Nothing happens without any good reason at all...or so they say.  So why do I seem to not understand why my life isn't getting any better, especially my lovelife.   I can't seem to get why when it comes down to my love life, I will forever be cursed not to have one.  It will always start nice.  You think that you're in a perfect relationship but time will pass and then they will just leave you without any reason at all except for the fact that they just woke up one morning and realize the love is gone... Why do I always end up in a bad relationship in the end?  What have I done wrong for me to deserve being left by the one I love? And now, I'm trying to get back to my old life but the past just keeps getting back at me over and over and over again.  I honestly don't know what to do anymore.  And this new guy I really like doesn't seem to know I exsist. Life sucks at the moment...I guess it's because of the Christmas season and for the passed 4 years I was used to the fact that I have someone special to celebrate it with.  But now, I don't have anyone at all.  I know it will get better but I'm just wondering when it will be.  Don't I deserve someone who loves me for being me and wouldn't leave me.  Someone who would keep his promise that he would love me always.  Someone who would be there to comfort me and care for me. Just when I thought that I have found that someone, reality bites and this time, it bit really hard.  I now see myself growing old alone while everyone else would be happy with their special someone in life.

       ANOTHER FOOD FOR THOUGHT   Well, it's not really another one of my usual write a quote and explain what I mean for it.  It's just one of my usual ramblings about life in general...  As I have been observing, kids today don't seem to realize the value of family.  A lot of people I know would rather stay with their friends or work in the office for God knows until what time until they decide to go home.  And they would just go to their rooms and sleep to go do their usual cycle the next day.  I really don't get them?  I for one would rather hang out with my siblings rather than go out with my friends.  There are times that I make up excuses just so that I won't go out with them on that day just so that I can hang out with my brothers and sister.  Though this make me stop and wonder...would I be one of those kids if my parents hadn't left the country?  Would I be the same as some of my friends who would rather go out and get drunk and then just go home and go to sleep without even communicating with their families?  I'm actually afraid to admit that I might be one of them.  I guess, it's a blessing in disguise that my parents have left us at a very early age (I was 11 with chicken pox when my dad left and a year after that my mom followed).  When I parents left, my siblings and I have become closer than most of the families I know, including my relatives.  We have this special bond between the four of us that other people envy sometimes and I'm really proud to say that I'm happy that we're this close.  Unlike some people who couldn't open up to their close family, I don't have a problem opening up with my family.  It's really good to know that I can count on them when I need them the most.  I'm happy with my life.  Even if I'm not that financially rich, I know that I'm rich in other ways...like my family.  The only thing I envy about other people is that they get to see their parents all the time...I only get to see them once every two years.  Sometimes, I don't get why people would say something bad about their parents.  I don't see the point of people cursing the people who gave them life and raised them.  I guess it's because I don't get to see my parents often and I tend to miss them a lot.  I don't show it though.  The Christmas season is nearing, and Christmas is a time to spend with your family.  I hope that people realize how lucky they are that they would get to spend this season with both parents and their siblings.  It's something that I don't get to do often anymore.

       One of the Guys    "You'd never guessed who cooked this for us....Mitch!" - LEVEL UP Inc. AGM   This phrase would be both an insult and compliment for me.   A Compliment   Why?   Because at least for once in my stay in that company I was appreciated for what I have done.  At least for once, I have heard something nice about me from the people I work with.  Because at least that one time, they don't see me as "one of the guys".  Because for once, I actually felt good about myself because I was appreciated.   An Insult   Why?  Because they never would have thought that something nice would ever come out from me.  Because they think I'm "one of the guys".  And for a short time, they look at me and whoa and behold...Mitch is actually a girl.  Because they've forgotten about it after they have had their fills...Never to be remembered again.  It was just a passing thing...  Because for all the things that I've done, I don't get appreciated.  ****  Sulking again, I see...  I guess there are some good points and there are some bad points when you're treated as one of the guys... Heck I've been treated like one of the guys since I was three years old.  Heck, I even thought I was a lesbian as I was growing up because of it...Thank God I don't have that identity crisis anymore.  Yes, I was one of the unlucky few who was lost and confused.  But don't get me wrong, I respect homosexuals and their beliefs...I even have good friends who are gays.  Anyway, going back to me...  It can be good to actually be one of the guys...As our AGM told me, it's not a turn off if you're one of the guys because they can easily talk to you, you get noticed more.  Sad part is, they do notice you...But they still see you as a bud...Nothing more.  Being one of the guys, they assume that you walk, talk, act, dress like a guy.  So when you veer off on the usual jeans and shirts to actually wear a skirt or a dress...They tease you so much, you'll end up red with embarrassment.  They wouldn't say, "You look good." but rather "What's with the dress?"  Insult and compliment...Very confusing.  And if you're "one of the guys" like me.  You'd get a head ache thinking too much.  Don't get me wrong, I like hanging out with guys.  Honestly, I'd rather hang out with them more than girls.  Guys are easy to get along with, easy to feed and don't care if they have disgusting habits.  Wouldn't hurt either to listen to their jokes about women, sex and cars.  Not to mention that they protect you whenever something goes wrong.  I guess it's mostly because I grew up having guys for best friends and having more male cousins than females (I have 15 guy first cousins and only 4 girl first cousins) that's why I like to hang out with guys more.  But still I wonder, being "one of the guys" may be fun and all that but there are times that they do forget that I am a girl beneath all of this bravado I show them.  Sometimes, it really does hurt when some girls get notice with the small changes they do and with me, it's just "huh?"  I get a compliment, one or two and really, I do appreciate it.  Those small compliments really lights up my day and nothing can actually go wrong when that happens.  But I guess, I'm still a girl after all.  I still need to feel that I am appreciated not just some sideway glance, a salute and a nod of compliment.  Though, I would still hang out with guys more than girls after I post this...All I wish is that people notice me more.  Not just a sideway glance, a salute and a nod of compliment...After all, beneath this "one of the guys" look I'm still a girl at heart...And isn't that more important?

       There Are Good Days...And There are  GOOD  Days   The year 2004 is the year of the Monkey...they say that if you were born on that sign then this will be a good year for you as well.  In my case, I really hope they're right.  Honestly, the year is starting off pretty well.  My new boss has shown that he can be trusted and that he actually trust my judgement concerning the people that I work with.  That includes the people who would actually be moved up.  It is really up to me whether they would be going up, stay where they are or let go.  It's really a big responsibility.  I really hope that I live up to his expectations.  So far, he's been giving me good feedback on my performance.  His only complain...I'm too nice.  Honestly, most people tell me that I am too nice.  It's even a bad thing too, or so they say.  So, as a challenge, my boss wants me to "professionally mature".  I guess balance the way I treat people, my relationship with them and how I assess them.  Take for example the people we were promoting.  I'm really happy to say that I have a hand on getting the the right people promoted...or so I think they're the right people.  Aside from myself who will be the one-woman Training Team, two shift coordinators will be moved to the "upper management" (as "up" as we can possibly climb in this new company at the moment).  One of the shift coordinator volunteered his services for the position that he is in right now.  The other one wasn't planning on moving, but I was the one who recommended him to climb up because I know that he is very capable of the task that was given to him.  When I went to talk to this office mate of mine, he was shocked to find out that he was being promoted to a "manager's position".    "He said something about, 'the need for an operations manager is really a necessity for the company at the moment and you were highly recommended.'" That officemate told me when I asked why our boss wanted to talk to him privately.  Actually, that made my spirit soar because at least now I know that people listen to what I have to say.  It actually feels good to find out that what I say gives an impact of what our company would become in the future.  So with these two climbing up, there is a need to actually move two new people up to the Shift Coordinator's position.  So, I made evaluations on the whole team and recommended two people in the process.  Which my boss again considered.  And I really  hope that I think I made the right decision again.  But of course, I took into consideration how other people see them, and with that I am glad that again my voice was heard and by the end of the month, all of these things will take effect.  Now of course, part of my job now is not only recommend people to move up, but also evaluate people's performances and release them from our services.  And honestly, as much as I hate to see people leave the company, there are times that it really has to be done.  And in this case, as much as I would be really happy to let this person go, it really pains me to do it.  Take for  example this other office mate of ours.  Everyone doesn't like him.  Everyone would try to avoid him.  Everyone just pretends to like him but stabs him at the back.  In my case, the first time I met him, there was this feeling I felt in my gut that I need to stay away from him at least 5 feet.  The last time that I had that feeling about someone I met for the first time saved me from a really horrible accident.  And as I have been observing now, I guess I'm right again about this person.  He really scares me.  Honestly, if I was the one who interviewed him, I think that I would have said no in hiring him.  But we have been observing him, he's been more trouble than help in the office.  So, as much as I hate putting people down and actually would have wanted to give him a third chance (people were already telling me not to include him in the training way before) he really needs to leave if he wouldn't improve himself.  That's actually a challenge for me.  Write something to that person so that he would understand the circumstances and that he wouldn't be hunting me down and kill me when he finds out I will have a hand on letting him go.  Oh well, as I've said, there are good days...and there are days that are just...days...  The better days...I get to spend some "alone" time with that guy I really like here in office.  Though the conversation was mostly talk about work and stuff, I'm really happy about it in any case.  I got to spend time with him alone and that's the best thing!  Now if I could only get him to like me...

       One Great Regret   With my parents here right now, my time out with my friends has been cut big time.  Don't get me wrong, I love my parents and it's really right because I don't get to spend time with them.  They will be going back to Saudi in February and I honestly want to spend as much time with them as possible.  But because of it, at the  moment I can't spend time with my friends who I usually see during Saturdays.  It sucks, I know but I have to make sacrifices.  But last Saturday, I really regreted not meeting my friends that time.  There was an RPG convention in Rockwell and I didn't get to go there at all.  I even promised that I would be GMing an Aberrant game for those people curious.  With so little time I have for myself these days, I honestly found time to make character sheets for those new people who would be interested in joining a game.  I even have a story ready for the group I would be holding.  But alas, I wasn't able to go.  Last Friday, the company had a thank you dinner thing and after which all the managers have this late meeting.  I went home exhausted that my boss told me not to come in the next day.    But the next day, I get to spend time with my mom.  We went to Quiapo that time and then I went to watch a movie with my sister.  But even if Lord of the Rings is a good movie and all and I really enjoyed the time I had with my mom and sister, my mind kept going back to Rockwell..."What are those guys doing right at that moment?"..."I hope they get new people interested in RPG"..."What game would Jay be holding?"  Regret...I really regret not going there.  I really wished I was there.  I would have enjoyed it too.  I'm sure my parents wouldn't have minded if I get to spend some time with my friends that time...but oh well. Better luck next time for me...

       Stress, Stress and more stress   Hohum...  For the passed few weeks I have been a walking zombie.  The phrase "so many things to do, so little time" really applies to me at the moment.  I really feel the weariness and stress come over me.  I am mentally and physically tired from all the work that I do in the office.  Not to mention the added work I do when I go home.  Since my parents are here, I have to juggle being a daughter, a sister, a friend, a care taker and an employee.  Not to mention the added stress of being an ex-girlfriend of someone who broke up with me (yes, I was dumped) and still can't get over the idea that I went out to lunch with my officemates who are guys.  I am training people at the moment, but I have to make sure all the other people still do their jobs.  And if they have a problem, I have to know and find a way to help them out as much as possible.  Plus the fact that I have to evaluate one person in his performance and make sure that he doesn't make a mistake anymore.  And I have to observe one of the people I helped promoted because there have been some complaints about him.  And I have to talk to the HR manager so that I know what I can do for "my people" concerning their raise and stuff.  And of course, trying to get this guy to like me is the hardest one of all.  I know it's not that important but it's one challenge I'm up for.  The only thing good about all the work that I'm doing is that I get to talk to that particular guy that I like more often. =D And I get to find out a lot about him from the conversations that we have.   He's even genuinely concerned about my health.    But the problem is, I don't think that he likes me that way.  I guess I have to be stuck as his buddy all my life. =(  That is actually a stress reliever for me. To be able to talk to him often I mean.  I guess, I have to settle being his friend.  Work has been taking his toll on me.  But I don't think that I would be given an assistant due to our lack of people at the moment.  It's really so stressful and since I'm the only one who can do the job that I'm doing right now, I can't seem to find a way to get some real rest.  The guy I like has been telling me to get some rest because he has seen me look so tired and harassed.  Honestly, he's right.  I do need a rest.  My boss has also been telling me the same thing.  But at the moment, I really don't see how I can.  I have so many things to fix and people to train.  I really don't know when I can get a time out from all of this.   "So many things to do, so little time."   Those immortal words will keep crossing my mind until I can get this aching body (and heart) some time out...when that would be...who knows?

       Another Day for Ranting   Just when I thought things are looking up for me, there was another blow on the head.  Why do I keep on getting hit each time I'm trying to get up?  I guess that's the way of life.  I have these fears inside of me that keeps creeping up inside.  Something is simmering in the office at the moment and it would only take a few things to make it boil.  And when it reaches the boiling point...well honestly, I really don't want to think about it.  I shed my first tear last night when I was talking to my officemate.  Okay...so I have been crying a lot about many things, but this is the first time an officemate made me cry.    Though when I told him this morning, he apologized profusely but this was a first time that someone not related to me, not my ex-fiance and not my bestest best friend in the whole world made me shed tears.  It's not a great feeling, especially if that officemate was the office mate I really like.  But cried I did.  I was at home tying in the MSN, and trying to explain to them the situation but my officemate blew his top (and it's not just what i was trying to explain to him but there was something else) and he let it all out on me.  But as I've said, when I went to the office this morning he apologized.  And since I like him, I have to forgive him right?  Anyway, that was my first rant.  Second rant, on to the discussion when I got to the office.  So he explained the reason why he's a little ticked off that time...and whoa and behold I'm a little ticked off as well.  One of the people I helped promote has been a little power hungry lately.  And he's starting to ticked off a lot of people especially the people we needed the most.  Our team in the office is already in trouble as it is because we're living in a bubble. Now he does this...honestly, I'm currently writing a letter to my superiors telling them about this...but I can't seem to finish it up. Why?  I have honestly no idea!  Third rant, I guess this is one of those reasons why I can't seem to finish up a that letter to my superiors because I don't think my superiors are doing anything about this.  I'm currently writing a letter to our big boss about my two superiors and their performance.  I really don't think that they have the capability to head us.  But who am I in the scheme of things right?  Anyway, I'm still going to write a letter, hoping and praying that someone would listen.  And lastly, my conversation with this guy I like in the office.   I thought things are really looking up for me.  I know he doesn't like me, like me but at least that time I thought I had a chance at him.  Now I learned that he's getting back together with his girlfriend.  When he was telling me that, I honestly have a hard time breathing...But all I can do was congratulate him and wish him all the best.  But inside I was screaming "Die bitch! Die!!!"  With that, I realize that I would be alone.  Yeah, I know.  I wrote this line a lot of times now.  But that fear is still there.  And with that new information that I got, do you really think that I would think differently?  That's my worse fear...living like my aunt.  All alone with no one but herself.  I've asked him and I've asked a friend of mine, what  could be wrong with me that the good guys aren't even remotely interested in me and the jerks do?  What is it about me that tends to lead them away?  I don't know the answer to that question.  And I'm really hoping I find the answer to all this.  Honestly, at the moment, I'm really tired, stressed and wasted.  I am feeling numb and cold.  With what's going on in the office and my personal torment...I feel like I'm being torn apart without anyone there to help me.  The office is divided.  And I fear that the key people who is keeping me there would leave...and if they do...where would I go?  I don't want us to separate...at least not yet.  It's too soon for it.  I've known these people for only a few months and they have made an impact in my life and I for one don't want them to leave me.  And at this emotional state that I am in right now...I will trully break down and crumble to a million pieces if they do leave me.  I have friends...and I love them all dearly.  But I don't want my new friends to leave me either.  There is so much to be learned from one another that it would really hurt me so much if we go our separate ways...never to see each other again.  And with all of this happening in my life...this is what I most fear the most.  I don't want to leave the third family I have established in the office.  Not yet anyway.  I still want to see Paul get married.  See Ricky play out that Vampire game we so wanted to push through.  See Dino get promoted to Game Manager.  See Noel smoke free.  See Raf pot free.  See JC finally happy with his true heritage.  See Christine walking down the isle with Jay.  So many fears...I wonder if I'll be able to see these push through?

       Happy Valentine's Day???   Well, well, well...another year another "celebration" of a very "heart-warming" holiday...Valentine's Day.  Also known to most of us as " Single Awareness Day "  Yes, it's that time of year again...and this year after four years in a relationship, I will again celebrate it alone.  I guess all my friends right now who I usually meet on Saturdays will be out in their romantic rendezvous somewhere in Metro Manila.  There would be couple eating dinner, watching movies, going dancing, in the beach, in Tagaytay, in.... well you get my point. =)  Okay...admittedly I am lonely.  These are those times of the year that being with someone really means something for me.  Yes, I am a hopeless romantic.  I'm that kind of girl who really loves it when your significant other shows how much he loves her.  I really like it when I get kissed or cuddled or being told sweet nothings by my man...(and yes as I write this, my face is turning into a grimace...'I can't be that kind of girl,' is the phrase that's running through my mind).  Yeah, admittedly one of the reasons why I have reserves going to meet my friends every Saturday is because of that. I see them with someone and I don't have anyone.  And what scares me is that Mr. Right may not be coming at all.  This guy I like in the office has got back together with his old girlfriend and by the looks of things, I guess they won't be breaking up anymore.  My chance with this guy is really 0%.  I now have to settle being his friend.  The good thing about it, he tells me stuff about his life and I really appreciate that.  That means, I am a good friend to him..right?  But that's all I'll ever be.  A friend.  Nothing more, nothing less.  And while my ex fiance and I are in speaking terms and actually are going into that stage of being friends, I don't think we'll ever get back together.  Four years of my life wasted in a lie.  I have friends...Yes I have a lot of those...And I love them dearly.  I cherish them with all my heart.  But it's still different when you have someone...and I mean   someone   who would be there for you, call you in that term of endearment that you use with each other, text you all the time just to tell you how much he loves you, call you up to ask if you've eaten lunch already...those kind of things that even if your friends do it to you it won't be the same if your guy or girl would be saying or doing it to you.  A simple rose.  In all those four years, I never gotten a rose from him.  But I still loved him nevertheless.  In all those four years, I was the one who buys him flowers...funny huh?  And now, I wish that I have somenoe to give flowers to.  Yup, Singles Awareness Day...I'm single, I'm aware and it really sucks big time.

       Hurting   There's this big weight that I carry right now and honestly it's one burden that I really don't know if I should even be taking.  It's not easy to do and I honestly have no hold of the people around me to do this in the first place.  The only thing I can really do is hope and trust that things will become clear.  As I can see it, there are more people here who I see are agreeing with me.  I don't see the point of dawdling at all but the thing is, they are right by waiting.  They have a strong point that we need to gather as much evidence as we can so that we can actually accomplish what we need to accomplish here.  Honestly, I'm torn.  One because, not all of them are bad people.  There are still some there who actually do their jobs and actually make things better for everyone.  It's just this thing that's hanging over all our heads that biting us.  I'm torn because, if we don't pull this off right, all of the people I hold dear in that office will suffer, and me with them.  I'm really afraid that if we do this and we don't make this right, I might end up jobless and I really don't think that there would be other companies who would be willing to hire me after this.   I feel so helpless.  And confused.  Torn between the people who pays me and the people who are the real reason I'm still there.  The pain in my heart (both literally and methaphoricly) is really aching and it's aching like hell.  It's like one huge hand is crushing it as I type this.  But as I've said in my previous blog, I will not falter..even unto my death I will fight for these people.  Hurting...i am really hurting right now.  I just want to get this over with.  Maybe, just maybe if everything is alright, I might breathe easily.

       Quotable Quotes    "Don't you  DARE  underestimate me, you arrogant bastard!" - Terry Bogard, Fatal Fury: The Motion Picture   There are times in my life that I am weak.  I can't move and I really feel like I'm worthless.  Eversince I've found out that I might get an operation, it really scares me to think that I'm in a delicate condition at the moment.  There are really those days when I would just lie down in bed and forget that I have to do some things.  I really am scared sometimes that to no ones knowledge I cry at night fearing of what the result might tell me.  But then I remembered this phrase from Fatal Fury.  And recalled the story of a human battling a god and won.  And as I think about it, the more it became clear to me that I shouldn't be afraid.  Facing this isn't as scary as it was anymore.  A lot of people may think that because I'm small and sickly it means that they can just push me wherever they want to.  I almost let them do it to until I remember this phrase.  A lot of times people underestimate me.  And they really regret it afterwards when they see that I can't be pushed that easily.  I guess it's something I had to do when I was growing up.  I have to be tough and not let anybody push me around.  From a cry baby to a tough chick isn't actually an easy transition.  And with my present state of looking like I'll fly away when you blow at me, well...you'll get the point.  Anyway, this phrase has really helped me alot now that I'm counting the days when I will be getting my result.  I'm still hoping that that damaged leaflet is just something natural and I don't need to be operated but if I do, I will get pass this and smile afterwards.  But the phrase helps me get my nerves together and not worry and beat all the odds that were passed through me.  I will not be intimidated.  I will not falter.  I will cross this shaky, broken bridge and I will jump and shout triumphantly when I reach the other side.  No one under estimates the little wolf...

       Another Love Song    If You Were Mine  by Boyzone   I see what she's doing to you And it hurts me so I wish I could steal you away But you just won't go Something's holding you close to her Something I can't see But come that day that you've had enough I pray you come running to me  'Cause if you were mine You'd know how good love could be And if you were mine I'd love you eternally If you were mine  Everytime I see your face It lights up my day But I watch you passin' me by And my sky turns grey Maybe someday you're gonna see I'm the one for you 'Til that then I'll just have to wait For my dreams to come true  'Cause if you were mine You'd know how good love could be And if you were mine I'd love you eternally If you were mine  My friends keep telling me let it go But what I feel they would never know I can't stop my heart beating so strong for you But you're with her and now with me Baby it's just sad as it can be  'Cause if you were mine You'd know how good love could be And if you were mine I'd love you eternally If you were mine...   This song wasn't aired at all in any of the radios when the album when out but it's a nice song and a very timely one too as what I have been feeling at the moment.  Yup, Valentine's Day might have ended but life goes on and so does my search for true love (did I just write that???).  As you can see in the song, I am a little upset that the guy I like got back together with his ex...but as i've said in my previous blog, I shall have to settle being his friend.  But that doesn't mean that I can't dream, right?  I still have this "fantasy" that he might look my way one time and see that I am the girl for him.  Yeah, if he was mine, I'll let him see how much I care about him.  If he was mine, I will love him eternally.  If he was mine...

       Is It Really Worth All The Sacrifice?   I have been thinking a lot lately.  A lot has been happening in the office lately, things that I really don't want anymore.  And with everything that's going on, problem arises and more often than not, no one hears our cries for help.  Everything that the team had stood for suddenly collapse right in front of us and we're all at our wits end.  Most of us are already thinking of leaving.  But for me, I honestly don't know where I can go if ever I'll leave.  At least my officemates have some place to go to, I really don't know where to go from here.  Honestly, is this really worth it?  I've been working my butt out for these people only to be taken for granted.  The worse part is, the team is getting flack from all the wrong things management has been doing to us.  I really can't stand what they're doing to us but I can't do anything about it anymore.  Honestly, I've gotten more stress than any of the work that I have been doing for the passed years since I've graduated.  My heart ailment has gotten worse and it's getting much worse everyday.  Back when there were only just a couple of people in our department, we were happy.  We were having fun.  We did our work and we were proud of it.  We were even eager to work, waking up early just so that we can go to work right on time, or even before time.  I used to see people always smiling.  And even with all the problems with the servers and stuff, it's still fine.  Now, they view us as being kids.  The fun of working is gone.  Is this really worth it?  Is all this worth anything?

       The Good, The Bad and the Hug   For the passed few days, my body has been in pain for so long now.  Well, it's really mostly my fault.   I had pushed my body to the limit.  Yup, like my officemate told me, I'm not that young anymore plus the fact that I have a heart ailment.  Since last Saturday, my body has been craving for rest.  And even though I took a leave today, I still can't find time to really rest.  I have so many things to think about and I can't seem to get my body to just lie down and relax.    This is going to be the last time I'm going on a Bike Marathon to Tagaytay with my best friend.  I love the guy, don't get me wrong, but the next time he's going to invite me to go biking, I'll make sure I'll stay in my city first. :P  My body is really aching so much...it was a mistake that I went to work yesterday and stayed up until 4am this morning.  I'm actually really hurting so much right now, I'm having a hard time typing.  The good thing about that little trip of ours last Saturday was that inspite of the aching joints, I did have fun.  I got to spend time with my best friend whom I haven't seen in years.  We got to talk about the past and the times that we had when there were the three of us and not just two.  It was really great experience, despite the fact that my whole body is bursting with ache.  Last night was also good and bad.  Bad because I went home aroung 3am this morning and I lost my voice by some unknown reason.  I'm more or less grounded by my grandmother, so again, no staying up too long outside my home and it's again, Office-Home for me for the next couple of days.  But on a good note, even though I have an aching body.  I did get to spend some time with my younger brother's favorite band and I got them to sign for him.  Though they're not the two people my brother really likes, at least I got them to sign right.  And I hope my brother appreciate it.  Another good that led to this is that I got to spend at least short time with the guy I like.  And at last, I got a hug from him.  I know it's childish and shallow but the guy sees me as "one of the guys".  Getting a hug from him is really something.  And yes, I'm blushing right now just remembering it.  Yes, I really like this guy.  And yes, it hurts to see him with someone else.  But knowing that he treats me as a real friend is really worth something to me.  Well, I guess at the moment, that's that.  I am going to sleep now because my joints are really aching like hell so I better get some rest.

       Realization Hits Me   I was viewing one of my friend's blog when realization hit me.  I've been writing on this blog for a year now.  I've started writing because it give me something to do when I was working on a project base job.  It was really stressful and I really needed an outlet because of it.   Hence, I've taken my friend  urlLink Jay 's advice and got myself a blog.  It was good medicine.  I've let out my feelings in this blog.  My pain, my joy, my problems..everything that I want to let out I let it out here in my blog.  I have written a lot of different things here.  I gave out my ideas and stories too.  I actually became a better person because of this.  Thanks to my blog, it really helped through a lot.  And now that I am having stress again because of what's going on in the office, I really appreciate having this with me so that I can vent out everything that I wanted to.  Thank you blog! Thank you very much!

       In Other News   I'm turning 24 at the end of the month and I can still be grounded.  Yup.  I'm grounded for 2 months.  I have to be home at 7pm at the most otherwise I will not be allowed to go out at night anymore. Even if it's really an important event.  I did deserve it.  After all, I am sick to begin with and they are just concerned about my health.  I really don't mind.  I have been having a lot of stress lately and going home early might help me out to relax and regenerate.  So I guess, it's a blessing in disguise that I am grounded.  At least, I will be able to rest a bit from all the shit that has been happening.  Speaking of shit, that's the reason why I have been coming home late.  There have been a lot of disgruntled employees that we really need to talk it out outside the office and just release everything that we need to release.  So that at least we can keep our sanity when we're inside that hell hole.  Last night...or should I say this early morning was one of those examples.  As I've said, I'm already grounded and I went to dinner with them.  And we let out all the things that we have been keeping inside and we just have to release it all out.  By 11pm, we were laughing again.  And not just any laugh but the genuine laugh of someone having the night of their lives.  And it really felt good.  After dinner, we have decided to take a road trip.  I was suppose to go straight home that time but I have this crazy idea to go detour to another officemate's house and just hang out for a while.  We also did update him on what's been happening.  And we were thinking of an action plan on what to do.  We have a vague idea now as well. All we have to do now is really fix ourselves up and just try to do the best that we can.  We really had fun that night.  Plus the fact that I get to see someone who we haven't seen in a long time and he gave us hope of a new beginning.  I just hope that that new beginning would be soon. =)  All in all, I got to relax and have fun again with people who I now consider real friends.  If this company has been giving me all the crap in the world, one good came out of it.  I have found friends like them.  And I wouldn't exchange them for the world.  Yup I am grounded.  But what I did yesterday was worth it!  For the first time in my life, I got to really relax and have fun.  Something that I have not done in months.  In addition, the reason why I didn't get to meet my barkada was because of that something that I've found out in the office that I really need to fix.  And here's hoping.  If it did push through...our problems will be more or less solved.  So I guess I have to ask everyone to cross their fingers... =)

       My Sincerest Apologies   Today is the celebration of my friend  urlLink Kate 's Birthday.  But because of all the things that has been going on lately, I didn't even get to see her today.  I was suppose to meet them at lunch.  They had plans on dinner tonight for which I was also invited but because of some other plans, I couldn't make it.  So our friend Jay suggested that I just go there for lunch to which I agreed to.  But as I've said, certain forces didn't make me want to go there today so I missed out on everything.  Kate, my sincerest apologies.  I really wanted to make it but I just didn't get to do it.  I've make up for it I promise.

       This Means War   Now it starts.  All the disgruntled people in the company that I am in right now are started to leave, and now I'm contemplating whether to leave as well or not.  When I started in that company, I liked it very much because they really want to put the fun in the system.  Seven months back when we were all cramped up in that small room with the orange door, it was hot, it was cramped but we were having fun!  We laugh all day and make it a point to be happy all the time.  It was small, the computers where always breaking down, we were underpaid but we were happy.  Now, there are more of us, we have resources, they raised our pay somewhat but we're not happy anymore.  All because of the fat bastard and dark meat.  I miss the old days.  When being a gamer was a prerequisite to become a Game Master.  Now all they wanted are people with customer service experience.  I work in an online gaming company.  The first of it's kind here in our country.  I would be assuming that they would really be looking people who really plays games.  I do not see the point of not getting gamers in an ONLINE GAMING COMPANY.  It's really ridiculous.  I miss the old days when  I can still say that I love this company.  Now, I'm damning it to hell.

       So This is Where We're Heading   I just found out this morning that the guy I like in the office will be leaving sooner than I was expecting.  Honestly, I'm hurting.  Damn! I'm hurting so hard right now, I really want to break down and cry all night.  Another person lost in my world, all because of this Godforsaken company.  I had done all I can for them and the least they can do is thank me for a job well done.  But instead of that, I get scolded at for speaking my mind because we weren't being heard in the office.  I was wrong, says my boss.  And I wanted to kick his twinkie right then and there.  Like my officemate told me this morning, all the stress that I am having right now isn't worth it.  I'm young and have a lot of things to offer for the world.  I really don't need this company for me to go ahead.  So while I'm young, I have to start thinking of myself for a change and get what I deserve.  Not this stress that I am having right now which shouldn't really be happening to me.  And as I see it, he is right.  But the problem is, as compared to them their course gives them plenty of options to chose from in a career path.  I on the other hand will have a hard time looking for work.  And as much as I really hate it there now, I really just can't stand leaving the people there all alone.  I know, I am not a savior of sorts but still, I feel responsible.  I was the one who hired them in the first place.  And now, I don't know what to do anymore.  I shed a few tears in the office this morning.  But I have not shed all of my frustration out.I really don't think I can at the moment.  I feel like all the emotions has drained away in my being and a hollow shell is all that is left of me.  I am hurting.  I am angry.  I want revenge.  Enough is enough.  Screw them for all the things that they have given to the team that makes our work harder than what should be.  Now the problem is how to do it...

       Strength In Numbers   There has been alot  of things happening and it just keeps on adding everyday.  I sense something big is going to happen if this thing keeps going on.  But frankly speaking, I don't care anymore.  I guess, the people in the office have taught me a great lesson.  Don't give your trust out easily.  I'm a very trusting person.  But now, with everything that has been happening, my faith in believing in people has started to dwindle.  Sure I still have people I trust. People I will know I can trust my life to. People who wouldn't let me down and I would never let down.  But there are people who would really play both ways.  And I'm really afraid that if I trust these people, I would fall.  But again, the people I trust with my life are still here with me, at least until we all finish our contracts in that godforsaken company.  And with them there, I know I can still do what ever it is I need to do there.  But when they leave, whatever it is that is out there for me, whether or not I get another job right after that, I'll leave with them.  I don't care if I'll be jobless again for a year, but when they leave, I won't hesitate to hand in my resignation as well.  There's safety in numbers.  And while I know that they are still there, I feel safe.

       Another Dose of those good ol' Tests         You're  The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe !   by C.S. Lewis     You were just looking for some decent clothes when everything changed quite dramatically. For the better or for the worse, it is still hard to tell. Now it seems like winter will never end and you feel cursed. Soon there will be an epic struggle between two forces in your life and you are very concerned about a betrayal that could turn the balance. If this makes it sound like you're re-enacting Christian theological events, that may or may not be coincidence. When in doubt, put your trust in zoo animals.      Take the  urlLink Book Quiz  at the  urlLink Blue Pyramid .     Cool!         You're Vietnam!      After years of muddling through on your own, you've finally repaired  yourself to a point of respectability. &nbsp;You would have been much better off had  people you didn't like not kept insisting on spending so much time with you. &nbsp;But  those times are fading quickly and these days you're pretty sure you won't get burned.  &nbsp;Star power!   Take the  urlLink Country Quiz  at the   urlLink Blue Pyramid       And to think I've already started my own nation. :O

       Something Different for a Change   Welcome to the  urlLink Rogue Nation of Kirsikka     The Rogue Nation of Kirsikka  "We have all the rights to be happy!"  UN Category: Democratic Socialists  Civil Rights: Below Average  Economy: Reasonable  Political Freedoms: Excellent   Location: the West Pacific  The Rogue Nation of Kirsikka is a tiny, devout nation, remarkable for its burgeoning wolf population. Its compassionate, intelligent population of 5 million are fiercely patriotic and enjoy great social equality; they tend to view other, more capitalist countries as somewhat immoral and corrupt.  The enormous government concentrates mainly on Religion & Spirituality, although Healthcare and Social Welfare are on the agenda. The average income tax rate is 31%, but much higher for the wealthy. A substantial private sector is led by the Furniture Restoration industry, followed by Beef-Based Agriculture and Trout Farming.  Crime is relatively low. Kirsikka's national animal is the wolf, which frolics freely in the nation's many lush forests, and its currency is the kirsk.   I have started a nation. =) Now, all I have to do is learn how to run it.  If I do a good job, maybe I will be able to understand the situation of my own country right now.  After all, I'm not an economist and I really don't read the papers...I'm more or less clueless on what's happening in the world.  But with this little game that I have started to play, maybe it could help me understand more. =)

       Stories...Another kind of bread     "People needs stories more than bread itself"  - Arabian Knights Movie from Hallmark   Another food for thought.  What are stories anyway?  Just a jumble of experiences made into something worth telling, or an adventure that takes the listeners or readers into a world where you can escape your reality.  Stories are not just some means of escaping reality.  Lessons can also be learn from them.  They are not just some random experiences worth telling but they also help other people better themselves and make them feel good.  Stories that come alive in ones imagination offer that person a chance to become who he wants to be and gives him a chance to escape the problems that he has...or better yet, it also helps him fix his problems.  Stories are not just for children.  I have known that eversince.  Fairy tales, Legends and Myths that we have heard as bed time stories not only helps the child as he grows older, it would also help him face all the problems and fears that he will encounter as he grows old.  People nowadays forgets these things.  They forget the value of a good story.  Now, with all the cool gadgets and electronic games and stuff a child's imagination isn't as great as in the "old days".  A good story, lost in the shelves.  People tend to forget that all the good stories that you see on TV or the Big screen came from the mind of someone.  All he/she needs is making it into reality.  But why stop there?  Why stop at only watching other people's imagination come to life?  Why don't you start making something from you mind and realizing it?  Give your share of stories.  Maybe someone you meet at the bus needs that "bread" to fuel him up for the day. =)

       The Elevator Story    It was suppose to be one of those usual days in the office.  You come in, work, interact with people, eat, do some errands for your team and then go home.  Nothing out of the ordinary happens in this simple call center company where I was an HR manager.  It was really supposed to be an ordinary Friday, but getting stuck in an elevator changed my life forever.   This is Jenny Mendez.  A simple girl working as a HR manager in one of the newly established call centers in Makati.  It was just her luck that her expertise was really needed, hence she got the HR manager’s position though she was once a call center agent.  She walks around the office, folder in hand, looking into the different departments and observing their day to day routine.  On her rounds she usually finds herself lingering in the Customer Care Department watching one particular Team Captain who was doing his own rounds and checking if his team was doing their job.    That was Matthew Perez.  He’s what you would call the company’s “crush ng bayan”.  Everybody likes him not just because of his looks but because of his personality as well.  Much like Jenny, he was one of the “pioneers” in that company who help developed and established the call center department.  He was one of the “newer” groups that showed skill and leadership so he got the Team Captain job when they were moving people up.  These two have been working together for almost six months already and though they treat each other as friends, they never did know how one really feels for the other.  They’ve become good friends, each telling each other their problems and concerns.  But they never told each other how they really feel for each other…until one Friday afternoon on their way home.  “Anything else I need to know before I head home?” Jenny asked the Customer Care Manager during their weekly status meeting.  “Yeah,” he answered.  “I need the new people in for training next week.  Did you get the twelve people I need?”  “I’ve asked three people to come in for their final interview tomorrow,” she answered taking down notes as she listens.  “Whether or not I’ve completed the twelve you’ve asked me, who ever gets in will start training on Monday.  I have the conference room ready for the training already.”  She gave a short smile that emphasized the dimple on her right cheek and she started writing again.  “Great!” The customer care manager exclaimed.  He was a burly man, with a smile on his face all the time even when there are huge problems in his department.  He talks to everyone in his department and gives them tips on how to better answer the phones.  “That’s it!  Unless someone else has something to add.”  “Yeah,” replied Greg Mariano, the Operations Head.  A much younger man than Jenny or Matthew but was very smart and talented for him to get the Operations head job after only being Team Captain for a month.  “We have new policies that we need to push through to our people.  Matthew, Tess, Jeremy, we need to test it out if it works.”  “What new policies?” Asked Jeremy, one to the Team Captains.  He’s one of the oldest people in the group but always acts like he’s young.  “We haven’t even establish the latest spiels that we should be using outbound, now we’re changing policies again?”  “Well the spiels stay,” answered Greg.  “But the way we record the calls and the documentation have to be different now.  It’s taking too much of the agent’s time.  This new policy will make their work more efficient.”  “So will this cut down the agent’s documentation time?” Matthew asked.  “I mean, why should we change what we have been doing since the start if the workload would be more?”  “That’s why we need to start the new policy,” Greg replied calmly.  “I mean, we need to test if it does work before we really say we continue to do it.”  “You have new people coming in,” Jenny remarked.  “Are you sure that’s wise?”  They all paused for a moment and considered her words.  Jenny wasn’t much of a talker.  But she always made sense when she does.  She was really one of those people who just keep silent and fade in the background but will eventually come out of the shadows when something goes wrong.  “We’ll just get a small team for this,” Greg answered.  “The three of you need to what…draw straws or something…so that we will know which team would be our guinea pig.”  Tess raised an eyebrow at that remark.  She was very opinionated and smart.  She always has something to say everytime things don’t go her way. Much like Jeremy, she has a tough skin but deep down inside, she was kind and cares about her team.  “Draw straws? You’re kidding right?” was all she said.  The meeting doled on until the group finally worked something out in the end.  When the meeting was adjourned, Jenny said good bye to everyone and started to head out unaware that Matthew was on his way out as well.  She hit the elevator button and immediately the center elevator opened for her.  Jenny tentatively stepped inside, very aware that the center elevators tend to fuck up sometimes.  Suddenly, she heard Matthew called out, “Jen! Hold the elevator!”  Jenny held the open button of the elevator and took a peek outside to see Matthew running down the hall trying to catch up.  With a small leap coming inside, Matthew got in just in time for the automatic doors to activate and closed down to go down from the 22nd floor towards the ground floor of their building.  “You know,” Jenny started.  “You didn’t have to run.  I was holding the elevator door open for you.”  “I know,” Matthew answered.  “But I just wanted to make a dramatic entrance through the elevator.  Besides, if I didn’t run, the doors were starting to close already.  You’d be alone if I didn’t run.”  He gave her a smile, which made Jenny’s heart leap.  Jenny raised an eyebrow and answered sarcastically, “Right….”  They both stared at the elevator door in silence while they wait patiently for the elevator to go down to where they were destined to be.  But just as they were about to reach the 8th floor, the elevator gave a jolt and stopped sending all the lights out as well.  Both passengers stumbled and found themselves in each other’s arms trying to steady themselves as the elevator came to an abrupt stop and the emergency lights went on.  “What happened?” Jenny asked as she tried to steady herself in Matthew’s arms.  “Is there a power failure?”  “I hope not,” Matthew answered as he tried to steady both of them.  “Wait, let me try to call Greg for confirmation.”  He brought out his phone and called their co-worker for some news.  And indeed there was a power failure on the whole Metro.  The generators did kick in as Greg had informed them but it wasn’t enough to power the elevators.  As it turned out, there were more people in the other elevators that were stuck as well.  The worst part was, they don’t know when the power would return.  As Matthew was relating all this to Jenny, he noticed that she was a little edgy and unsettled.  She kept looking around the dark room and walking back and forth.  He noticed that she was starting to hyperventilate.  Suddenly, Matthew remembered that Jenny was claustrophobic.    Another attempt to come up with a romantic story...it's not finished but that's the first part of it...I shall try to come up with a continuation of it when i have the time. =)

       Another Year...   Today I've just celebrated my 24th birthday.  And this birthday is much like any other birthdays except for the fact that I am single again and I even though I am tired and craving for sleep now, it was the best celebration ever.  It's really ironic.  People don't seem to remember that it's my birthday today but I am still happy nonetheless.  Unlike last year where my phone wasn't stopping on beeping and ringing because of people who wanted to greet me that day.  But today, most of the people I had expected to greet me didn't and the people who I wasn't expecting to greet me, greeted me with warm smiles and open arms.  That was really heart warming.  Early this morning I got the best gift of all.  I got to spend the first second of my birthday with people I now consider my closest friends (though they don't seem to think it =D).  And despite the fact that I came home at 1:30am this morning, it was the best birthday gift they could have given me.  Making me smile and laugh despite the problems that our company if facing because of that game.  I got the warmest hugs from them and got to realize how stupid I was because I fell in love with a jerk (but that's another story all together).  Anyway, this birthday of mine will be one I could never forget.  Not only do I get a warm hug from the guy I like but I also found out who are the people I can really depend on and trust with everything.

       A Humbling Experience   Tomorrow would be more or less a humbling experience for me.  I will go back to where I've started...doing "field work".  Why did I say it would be a humbling experience for me?  Well, I only have one main reason.  And that is, I would be working for the people whom I have trained in the job that I would be doing tomorrow.  I would be managed by the same people who went to me to ask what the hell they would be doing with the kind of job that we were suppose to do.  They went through me just to get to where they are right now.  Plus the fact that if it wasn't for my recommendation, they wouldn't be where they are today.  A very humbling experience for me.  Aside from two people who came a week before I came in the company, I have seniority over everyone else in that room (well, except for the Cust Care girls of course).  I was the one who more or less told them what to do during their first week at work.  I was the one who taught them how to use the tools and showed them what to do and where to go.  Tomorrow would be the other way around.  This is because I'm being evaluated.  This is because they think that I don't deliver on time.  This is because they think that I have been too stressed out and bringing my personal problems with me in the office (okay, so maybe this part is true).  But as I could remember, the only think that I haven't been delivering is the Minutes of the meeting.  Yes, I am ranting.  But even though that were true, I wouldn't let them get to me.  I would show them what I can do and do my job well.  I would let them re-evaluate me and I will show them who I am.  And if I don't, well...oh well, their loss not mine.

       Looking Back...   Everything is really going down. I have been so stressed lately and I have been doing things all wrong.  I need to get back to the good ol' days of just going to the Green Belt and play RPG...not even that is happening anymore.  But let's not forget where we came from.  And let's not forget that there are reasons for everything.  I need to be thankful.  Things do happen for a reason and I for one believe in fate...though we have our own choices as well.  So, even though all this is happening, I am thankful for:  1.) Paul Co, Noel Cortes, JC Cuneta, Rafael Olivar, Ricky Santos and Dino Tansioco for being good friends of mine and putting up with all the mishaps that I have been making in the office.  They keep me sane when insanity is creeping right behind me and they protect me from anything.  I really consider them as the people I can trust with not only my life but with all my secrets and stuff.  2.) Dinner Outs.  My other way of relaxation.  Eating is good...really it is...  3.) Bubba Gumps.  They should be thankful too since we make them rich for ordering Bucket of Boat Trash all the time.  4.) My siblings.  Even though I'm like this, they keep on understanding me.  5.) My parents.  Always there for support.  6.) Leonard Banaag for opening my eyes to a brighter future.  And an opportunity I couldn't pass out on.  7.) Chris Dee, Lerxis Pingcas and JP Montejo for just being them.  Their personalities lights up my days everytime I see them.  8.) Genevieve Mina and Joan Madariaga for believing in my writing ability.  And also for listening to all my rantings about my life and that special someone who still doesn't know how I feel for him.  9.) That special someone that will remain nameless until further notice.  Though you do not know that I like you, you still care for me and I appreciate that.  10.) This company that I am in right now.  If I didn't get accepted, I would have died a long time ago.  And because you have opened my eyes for seeing that I can write and I will use this talent for something better.  11.) Jed dela Peña and Yasker Yu.  These people are very sweet and have so many ideas in their heads that they unconsciously push me to be as creative and innovative as them.  12.) The readers of my blog (if there are any) who keeps on reading all the rantings and ravings of a little wolf lost in her little world.  I hope that you enjoyed every minute of my journeys.  With that, I thank God for letting me stay here a little longer.  I guess He's not yet ready to take me and I have a lot of things to fix in my life.  Another chance, another challenges faces me everyday.  Thank God I'm alive!

       I think I'm in Trouble...   I just found out last Friday that I might not get my old job back.  Well, I'm also considering of resigning if I have another place to go to.  But as of the moment, I really don't know where to go.  I really need to think things through a lot because of the condition that I have.  Where I work at the moment is very stressful. But this is the only job I know (except for where my friend Leonard is right now) that allows you to talk to the highest boss there is and just hang out with the guy.  There is no dress code and you get to be who you want to be.  I do get stressed...God knows how I get stressed but if I do go away, I will be in a company that you wouldn't be able to just knock on your boss' door and tell him that the office sucks.  I would be in a company that's really bent on getting you to work more and not get anything for it.  I would be in a company that's so stiff, you'll think everybody is frozen.  And I don't want to work for that kind of company.  As much as possible the company (even just the environment) would still be more or less fun.  I see that in the company where my friend Leonard works.  But I have to wait until October to actually be there.  Anyway, I will have to wait patiently for that move.  It's not that far away anyway, it's already April. Six months more and I'll be able to move.  But here at present. I think I'm in trouble...well, I'm actually more concerned for my officemate.  I saved some chat messages from my officemates in my computer.  Some of the conversations there were really more or less ranting against the company.  Quite frankly it was my mistake to actually save them in the first place but I did not save these conversations to plot against them...well, not entirely...but I saved them because I wanted to attempt to write a story that has conspiracies and stuffs and our present ranting is really helping me develop the plot of it.  But I'm really afraid that because of the company might think about it in some other way.  That was indeed a stupid move on my part to save it.  But I never thought that it would be a point against me because with all the rants that I have been doing, I still work for them and I am still doing my best to fix whatever it is that needs to be fixed.  If I get into trouble because of this, I'll pay for the consequences but I'm more worried about my officemate and friend whom I have been talking to most about all this.  And I'm really scared that it might affect his clearance when he's going to leave already.  And I don't want that to happened.  It's really not fair for him since I was the one who saved our conversations in the first place because it was so good a plot to not make into a nice story.  I honestly feel guilty right now.  I hope that I don't get my friend in trouble because of this.  I myself am willing to pay the consequences for it but my friend doesn't even know I'm saving our chats.  I feel so stupid for saving it up in my computer because even though it's not really something against the company that I'm working for, it really gives a bad impression on both me and my officemate.  I feel stupid and dumb and would like to crawl into a hole and lie there until the next century.  I have a lot of problems lately and I really don't need this to add to it.

       Something to think about...     "How can one man carry the burden of the world's sins?"  - Satan, The Passion of the Christ   Okay...maybe that isn't really how he/she said it in verbatim but the thought was there.  Finally, after two weeks of saying to myself that I will watch the movie, I have finally got to watch it.  It was even a nick of time too since the movie should have started at 3:35pm and I got there at around 3:36pm. =)  I guess, God really wanted me to watch the movie.  Anyway, as I have watched the movie, I never stopped crying from the beginning that he was caught by the High Priest's soldiers to him being taken down on the cross.  But it really hit me in the beginning when they were in the garden of Getsemany.  The devil was seducing Jesus into giving up his destiny.  For one man, Jesus really had suffered so much.  He carried such a huge burden and was killed because of it.  He died to save us all.  And all the burden was carried by only one man.  And as Lucifer had said, "no one can ever carry that burden.  NO ONE."  But Jesus succeeded and as he said "is making all things new".  A touching movie.  Now I know why a lot of people's lives were changed because of it.  If you have faith, it really means something than just another Hollywood flick.  Ironically, it was a refreshing change.  And I'm really happy that I finally got to see it.  It was really worth half-walking/half-running to the theater to go see it.

       Mixed Feelings...   Today was one of those days that started out wrong but eventually ended up right.  This morning, my wallet was yet again got stolen on my way to work.  Honestly, I don't really care about the money that was in it for it was only P300.00 But in it were very important stuff, like my two ATMs (one of which is the ATM where I get my salary), the picture of my beloved god daughter, my prescription for my heart and blood, my medicard, my college ID, my Timezone card, and my Advantage card.  I got everything locked down and fixed.  I just have to get the cards as soon as possible.  Anyway, things turned out right in the end. =)  Well, that was the bad news.  The good news is, I had a first glimpse of what it would be like in front of the wheel.  For real this time and not the virtual racing games that I play in Timezone.  Honestly, it was really a good experience but I have learned that I still need a lot to learn.  It was really scary but this way, I am more determined to learn and really understand the importance of driving well and not just something that I would take for granted.  I see how hard it was to really drive with just that short span of time.  It was an experience I would never forget.  Anyway, I'm happy.  At the end of everything, I saw a bright light. =)

       Feeling Good and Loving It   With everything going wrong with my life right now, something is still there to make it right.  I have been feeling bad and I really feel so alone these days like everyone is against me for some reason and try as I might to make things right, well, nothing seems to work.  But all it took was a simple smile on his face, a pat at the back or a simple hug to get me through.  And just experiencing that makes me feel until today ready to take on anything they throw at me.  Just as long as he's there with me.  I feel good, despite feeling tired from work.  But at the end of the day, all was well in my little world.

       I can't stop smiling   Today was more or less a very boring day until we were on our way home from work.  We've got good news! And I'm not yet at liberty to say anything yet but I'm really happy.  It's really good to actually smile again.  I can't believe the luck that I have.  And I really thank God that this happend in my life.  I can now see a bright future ahead of me.

       New Batch of Quizzes       My inner child is ten years old!    The adult world is pretty irrelevant to me. Whether I'm off on my bicycle (or pony) exploring, lost in a good book, or giggling with my best friend, I live in a world apart, one full of adventure and wonder and other stuff adults don't understand.    urlLink   How Old is Your Inner Child?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Yup! that's me alright! =)     Tomboy    urlLink   What's your sexual appeal?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     This is scary...have I ever told anyone I thought I was gay?     Congrats! Your a Pure Angel! Angels, as far as most of them go, are all compatabile creatures, but Pure ones simply are symbols of God. Pure Angels always appear when a child is born, when a rainbow is seen, or when someone shares their first kiss. They never grow old, an can appear in the shape of a naked woman with white, bold wings. Pure angels are the carriers of god, and show their love to everyone in the world.    urlLink   What Kind of ANGEL are you? (For Girls only) This Quiz has amazingly Beautiful Pictures!     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Wow! Sometimes I wonder...   March 31, 2004  Free report for: Michelle Segovia    Your Temperament is  Artisan    Artisans are the temperament with a natural ability to excel in any of the arts, not only the fine arts such as painting and sculpting, or the performing arts such as music, theater, and dance, but also the athletic, military, political, mechanical, and industrial arts, as well as the "art of the deal" in business.  Artisans are most at home in the real world of solid objects that can be made and manipulated, and of real-life events that can be experienced in the here and now. Artisans have exceptionally keen senses, and love working with their hands. They seem right at home with tools, instruments, and vehicles of all kinds, and their actions are usually aimed at getting them where they want to go, and as quickly as possible. Thus Artisans will strike off boldly down roads that others might consider risky or impossible, doing whatever it takes, rules or no rules, to accomplish their goals. This devil-may-care attitude also gives the Artisans a winning way with people, and they are often irresistibly charming with family, friends, and co-workers.  Artisans want to be where the action is; they seek out adventure and show a constant hunger for pleasure and stimulation. They believe that variety is the spice of life, and that doing things that aren't fun or exciting is a waste of time. Artisans are impulsive, adaptable, competitive, and believe the next throw of the dice will be the lucky one. They can also be generous to a fault, always ready to share with their friends from the bounty of life. Above all, Artisans need to be free to do what they wish, when they wish. They resist being tied or bound or confined or obligated; they would rather not wait, or save, or store, or live for tomorrow. In the Artisan view, today must be enjoyed, for tomorrow never comes. Atisans make up between 15 to 20 percent of the population, which is good, because they create much of the beauty, grace, fun, and excitement the rest of us enjoy in life.  The four types of Artisans are:  Promoters (ESTP) / Composers (ISFP) / Crafters (ISTP) / Performers (ESFP)  urlLink http://www.advisorteam.com/temperament_sorter/register.asp

       Words from a wise mage...     "I will do this. Nothing in my life matters except this.  No moment in my life exists except this moment.  I am born in this moment and if I fail, I will die in this moment." - Raistlin Majere at 12, Soulforge   I have to open this up again.  It is such a nice quote from my favorite Dragonlance character.  Determination.  That's the key.  When everything is so dark and bleak, a small gleam of light will pass through that small hole.  Hope is there.  And I hope that this time, this saying will hold true.  This time, I hope and pray that something good will come out of all the bad things that has been happening in my life.

       I Saw Hope   After one of the worst weeks of my life...finally a glimmer of hope!  I found a new way to enjoy everyday and it will help me in refreshing myself every single day as I go through the mundane chores of what I call my job.  Finally, I saw hope.  Finally, after I have slaved everyday to get a particular job done, someone would finally say "good work".  Finally, I saw a bright light.  Finally, I found peace.  It's really a refreshing thought.  I'm really happy that everything that I had been through for the passed few months doesn't mean anything anymore. Yes, I am happy!

       Grand Tour   Yesterday while my brother and I were waiting for my sister to leave the office (It was around 4pm that time and my sister leaves the office at 6) my brother drove around Global City and gave me a more or less tour of the place.  He drove around the area showing me good places to eat and hang out.  It was really great.  There was one coffee shop that was really great called CCF (or something like that) that makes good coffee better than any Starbucks or Seattles Best.  As we were driving around I saw Speed Zone.  It's a place where you can go carting.  I was really amazed and shocked.  At last something that I can do for my spare time.  And now that I have found out where it is, it won't be hard to go there in a while.  Wow! Global City is really a nice place.  It's really hard to go to if you don't have a car but when you're there, you'll be enjoying it immensely. ;)

         urlLink Click here for larger view   Don't worry...more pictures to come. =)  Yesterday I went out some friends of mine and we went to Enchanted Kingdom.  It was really great! I got to spend the whole day with them.  We arrived at EK at around 2pm.  But before we got there, we had lunch at KFC at a gas station near Susana Heights.  On the way we played a game called "Fact or Crap".  My friend Leonard won the first round but we never gotten to finish the second round though since we had lunch and forgot about playing when we continued on our journey to EK.  Too bad though, Paul was winning the second round. =)  Anyway, when we got to EK, we rode the indoor rides first and rides that have roofs on top of them because of the heat.  We were lucky too that we've decided to go on a weekday because there aren't that much people then.  We started out with bump cars, with Dino as our target person to bump all the time.  Then, we got to ride 4D(escape from Bane Manor) where you not only watch in 3D but also there are other effects as well like spurting blood and strong gust of wind. Then we went to Rialto which is more or less a disappointment after the 4D ride.  But the best rides that we got on were the Jungle Log and the Rio Grande.  Both rides we got wet.  We rode Rio Grande three times because we really wanted our friend Dino to experience getting wet like the rest of us.  We really enjoyed that ride very much that after the third time we rode it, the operator told us not to ride it anymore...of course she was only joking.  It was really great! I enjoyed it very much!  After that, we went to dinner at Leslie's in Tagaytay.  It was a great way to end the evening.  Our friend Paul took a lot of pictures.  He said that he needs to edit some of them first before he'll send me some of the pictures that we had as a group.  One pic that I really want is the picture of us right after that ride in Rio Grande where all of us were really wet.  That was really a great trip.  Too bad two of our friends (Noel and Raf) weren't there to enjoy it with us.  It would have been really great if all 8 of us went to EK as was the original plan.  Oh well, there will be next time.  But in the mean time, I really want to enjoy this moment.

       We Have a Pantry???   As we said those words, our manager looked at us in bewilderment.   These guys need to get out more,  was the thought that was coming through his head as he gave us a tour of the office.  Yup, like little children who have just seen a new toy and looking at it with star strucked eyes, we have never seen a good looking pantry like what we have seen in the office today.  It was really a great change from the pitiful excuse of a pantry in my old office.  The pantry that we had in the old office nothing compared to the pantry that we have right now.  For one it was huge.  It's honestly bigger than the office that we had in our old place.  It's cleaner.  And it has two juice dispensers that is bottomless and free!!! A huge refrigerator and a nice microwave oven...did I mention that we have a juice dispenser that is bottomless and free? =)  Anyway, I am having fun! And really feel good despite the fact that I have an aching body and I think that movie night (the night which I was really looking forward to spend some gimik time with my friends) is cancelled today.  And I'm afraid that next week we won't be able to watch the movie that we wanted to watch.  Its really sad but I'll try to look beyond this and just think of the good things that had happened to my life.

       Fitness  First...No Pain...No Gain   Yesterday, I've started working out in Fitness First. Needless to say, the lower part of my body is aching like hell.  But the good thing is I really feel good about it despite the pain that I am feeling.  The best part about working out is that I get to be with a group of friends.  We get to laugh at one another's mistake and get to watch each other's back to do the work out that we promised we'll do.  Today, I'll be going there later after work to see if I can do a day and night thing. Wish me luck!

It was fun while it lasted.  Just being at home doing almost nothing was really refreshing.  At least I got to recharge my batteries and I'm ready to face what's going to come on Wednesday.  I'm just glad that I won't be starting alone not like before.  I will be able to start my job with a group of friends and because I have my friends with me, I know that I can do a great job with this new company.  Wish me luck! =D

       Good...and Bad   Last night, I've watched a movie with my friends.  We got to watch Troy and it was really great! I'm really happy I got to watch it at last.  The scenery was fantastic.  The story line doesn't actually follow the real story of "Helen of Troy" but it gives another view of what happened that time.  The special effects was superb and of course the fight scene was really great! I was really happy that I didn't sleep through the movie because I was really tired and the movie ended at around 3am.  Before we went to the movie though, our friend treated us to dinner (we ate at Itallanis).  We ate a good meal that up to now, I am still full from what we ate last night.  We really got to enjoy ourselves and we talked about what's been happening to our lives and actually was able to laugh about the past.  But of course with all the good thing that happened last night, there's a downside to it as well.  As I've said, I got home at 3am.  To my grandmother's dismay.  I know it was my fault in the first place.  But as much as I want to apologize for it, my grandmother wouldn't be listening to what I would have to say.  So at the moment, I would just keep silent until she would talk to me again.  We are talking right now but there's this atmosphere of her being hurt because of my going home late.  I know her side.  But I was really hoping that she'll listen to mine.  Anyway, cross your fingers that everything will be fine today.  I really don't want to stop being happy because of this small mistake that I made.

       Quiz anyone?     You are most like Raven. Quiet and usually soft spoken, you don't like crowds and can be slightly gothic. You try to repress your emotions for one reason or another but one of your most powerful emotions is your anger. Your temper sometimes gets the best of you and when that happens those in your way would wish they weren't. You seem somewhat creepy to others and you earn a few odd stares but who cares? You aren't an outdoors person and avoid venturing outside when you can. You are generally the smart one and maybe not by trying to, the most cynical and sarcastic of the bunch which can be good or bad. You don't like anyone invading your privacy and you don't seem to be all that social. But for what it's worth you can be quite handy in a tough situation. You are drawn to the darkness or night most of the time. You appear mysterious and/or potentially dangerous at times and not everyone trusts you right away.    urlLink   Which Teen Titans Character Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla     Hehehe...I should have known... =)

       Another Disappointing Race for My Driver   So far in the season, I have yet to see Kimi Raikkonen in the top steps of the podium...it wasn't his fault really.  It's the car that's the problem.  Right now, the Mercedes engine isn't really that good.  It's not competitive enough to really win some points.  Very disappointing indeed.  Honestly, he's really a great driver.  Given the right car (a car that would actually last a whole race without its engine blowing up) he would be in the top steps like Michael Schumacher.  He's really good.  He's very competitive and at the moment, the limelight isn't actually at him because he has yet to finish a race at the top three... Sure he scored 1 point in Barcelona but he could have won more races if that  f@#$ing engine of theirs just last long enough to let him win a race!!!   It's not like he couldn't do it.  He had a great race last season...It's just his luck that the car isn't performing well this year.  I and my siblings have been talking about it while we were watching the race.  If Raikkonen moved into another team...say Ferrari or even BMW, maybe he'd score more points than Montoya or Barrichello.  It's really a good possibility.  After all he had done just that last year when he won second in the world championships.  Just give him a car that works, and he'll work wonders for his team.  Another disappointment for me was Ralf Schumacher.  I know, I know. Ralf hasn't actually been performing well this season either.  Being a Schumacher doesn't help either.  I just assumed that because he still doesn't have a spot on any of the teams next season he'll actually be doing well, trying to stay away from trouble as much as possible and try to get as much points even more than his team mate Montoya who would be leaving Williams BMW to join Mclaren.  Well, he has a lot to learn from his older brother that's for sure.  Oh well, another disappontment for me.  I really hope that the next race would give me something to look forward to.  And I do hope that I would see my boy Kimi at the top steps of the podium this time around before the season ends...I'm crossing my fingers...and I'll keep on praying for a miracle to happen.

       I'm Officially a Writer!!!   Last night, I just got my complementary copy of DC Kids Philippines.  It's a kids magazine that mostly centers on characters in the DC world.  Why, you may ask, do I have a complementary copy of DC kids? Well, I have an article written there.  It's not that long I know...and it really doesn't pay much, I accept that fact, but getting published! It's a dream come true!  I went home last night and showed my family the copy.  And for the first time in my life they have actually congratulated me for a job well done.  I'm still happy.  Despite the sudden arrival of my worst enemy, Mr. Cold, I am really happy.  Finally, I can actually put in my resume that I am a writer. =)  I'm really proud of myself.  Of course, this wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for some friends of mine. Leonard Banaag, for introducing me to the editor and actually giving me an assignment.  Paul Co, Noel Cortes, Dino Tansioco, and Ricky Santos for helping me out with the article.  I would be stumped and don't know where to look if it wasn't for them.  Well, if you guys want to look at the article that I made, just go to your nearest bookstore and purchase the June issue. =)

       Another Set of Tests   Thanks to my friend  urlLink Jay  here are some other test that you might want to try out as well. =)     In ages past and future, you have frequently been and usually will be a Dreamspeaker.  You are more connected with the spiritual than most other Traditions, and you are a vessel for their patterns, the ebbs and flows of the Umbra.  Whether you give yourself to nature or not, spirits are of the earth, and you feel its pulse.  You are alone in that you might eschew most limited human contact, but conversely, you are never lonesome, for you can reach beyond yourself in ways that mortals -- and most mages -- can't even comprehend.    urlLink   Which Tradition Mage Are You?     brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Cool! Tonnie was a dream speaker and so am I! ;)      You're a Garbage Pail Kid!!  You're dirty, foul, disgusting, and wrong.  But you're still funny as hell.     urlLink   What childhood toy from the 80s are you?      brought to you by  urlLink Quizilla      Huh? I don't even know what kind of toy this is!!! :O

       Okay...So It's Not That Disappointing   Last night...or should I say this morning the Canadian Grand Prix finished at around 3am with Kimi Raikkonen finally finishing a race but he finished at 7th place.  Okay, you would say that at least he finished and he finished with 2 points. Right?  Yeah, I guess you're right about that.  At least for once both Mclarens finished the race without blowing up. It's actually a good thing.  It means that their cars are improving somewhat...yes, it's still a  somewhat .  They still need a lot to fix and polish before they can actually compete against a Ferrari.  What's insulting to Mclaren right now is the fact that Renault and BAR Honda are above the points.  And to Kimi's dissapointment, he's not even on the top 5! unlike last year where he was second place and the year before that where he came in 5th.  Okay...it is not that disappointing because he get to finish the race without blowing up an engine...but still...he had electronics problem this time around where he needs to change steering wheels twice which cost him a possibble 6th or even 5th place.  Oh well, I have to be happy.  I mean, he did get points.  He was in the points once again even though it was only two points.  You have to give him credit that he did try his best to get in front as much as possible...he gave a good fight to Rubens Barrichello before he finally lost a position to him.  Oh well, don't worry Kimi! We're still cheering for you!

       Weekend At Home   It has been a long time since I just stayed at home on a weekend.  I am usually out during Saturdays and the family would be goind somewhere during Sundays.  But last weekend, I just spent both days at home with my family.  Not really doing anything but just watching VCDs and DVDs with my siblings and grandmother, eating spaghetti and burgers.  I usually wonder why some people would rather spend most of their days with their friends rather than their families.  I do not see the point of spending most of your time outside with people not really related to you by blood.  It's something that I really couldn't get.  I guess, I'm just lucky because the family that I have is really close knit that we'd rather spend time with each other than going out with friends.  Not that I don't enjoy going out with my friends, I really like it a lot.  I really love spending time with them, wacthing movies and eating out and just hang out, but honestly, it really is a different feeling spending time with friends than with your family.  For one, you can be really yourself with your family because they know you inside and out.  I know that you can also be yourself with your friends but there is still this feeling that you have to hold back at somethings even if you're really really close with them.  Anyway, I got to relax.  I mean, really got to relax.  I didn't think that I can get to relax like this...it's really a great feeling.  And the best part is, I got to spend it with my family.  We got to talk and tease each other and just be siblings.  I'm really glad that I am lucky to have a family like them...I wouldn't ask for anything else...well except of course a love life. =P

      It's time once again for letting out the present state that I am right now and let it out into a song.&nbsp; It's actually the state that I have been feeling for so long and I know that it's a long time now and everybody would be telling me to get over it but it really seems hard to do.&nbsp; Like the song said..."these wounds won't seem to heal...this pain is just too real...there's just too much that time cannot erase..." &nbsp;   My Immortal  by Evanescence    &nbsp;  I'm so tired of being here   Supressed by all my childish fears   And if you have to leave   I wish that you would just leave   Your presence still lingers here   And it won't leave me alone    &nbsp;  These wounds won't seem to heal   This pain is just too real   There's just too much that time cannot erase    &nbsp;  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears   When you screamed I'd fight away all of your fears   And I'd held your hand through all of these years   But you still have part of me    &nbsp;  You used to captivate me   By your resonating light   But now I'm bound by the life    You left behind   Your face it haunts   My once past and dreams   Your voice it chased away   All the sanity in me    &nbsp;  These wounds won't seem to heal  This pain is just too real  There's just too much that time cannot erase  &nbsp;  When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears  When you screamed I'd fight away all of your fears  And I'd held your hand through all of these years  But you still have part of me    &nbsp;  I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone   But though you're still with me   I've been alone   I'm alone    When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears  When you scream I fight away all of your fears  And I'd held your hand through all of these years  But you still have part of me    &nbsp;  Me...

       urlLink  20 Questions to a Better Personality    Wackiness: 60/100 Rationality: 94/100 Constructiveness: 48/100 Leadership: 80/100   You are a WRDL--Wacky Rational Destructive Leader. This makes you an  enemy of the state . You are charismatic and winning and a very dangerous enemy. You favor justice over compassion, and would almost rather see your opponent fail than you succeed.  You impact the lives of those around you more than any other personality. People remember your name and respect you. You are a tremendous amount of fun to be around and astonishing to watch. You are generally abstinent in your habits, and you like things tidy and ordered.  When picking teams, it is smartest for others to pick yours.     An enemy of the state...Hmm...Curious how they got that...

      Here I go again discussing about war.  Honestly I'm a little pissed off because of this.  Because of this so called war against Iraq, innocent people suffered and maybe die too because of something that they never actually wanted to happen.  I really hate this.  They never think about the innocent people who are in the middle of this.  They never thought that these innocent people stuck in the middle have families and people who will be lost without them.    The people who starts these wars never really care about the consequences that would occur.  They just care about the thing that they would gain after this, never caring about the people who fights for their stupid cause.  Now, people are suffering.  People are getting hurt and might even die because of this stupid war.  A war that shouldn't have happened in the first place.  People are suffering. One person might die because he was caught in the middle.  The government has promised that they will do their best to release the man but they refuse to oblige to the demand of the kidnappers.  I really hate this.  It wouldn't have happened in the first place if they didn't start this stupid war.  Oh well, I'm stil hoping and praying that everything will be alright despite the fact that I'm losing hope already.  On a good note and far from the war in Iraq, I am more or less happy that at last Kimi Raikkonen finally won second place.  At least that blasted car of theirs finally is making progress.  But as I've watched the two races after Ralf Schumacher's accident, JPM has started to become boring since he's not really racing against his team mate like what he and Ralf usually do during races.  Oh well, I'm both happy and pissed off because of two different issues.  Have a good day though

       Sticks and stones may break my bones but words can never hurt me.           I have heard that saying ever since I was a little kid and I had usually thought that this saying is true...well, I was just a kid back then.  Whoever gave out this saying should see how wrong it is.    Sticks and stones can indeed break my bones but words are much worse than that.  Words hurt.  It hurts more than the stinging sensation that any sticks and stones can do to you.  And unlike sticks and stones, the wounds that you will get from words will be etched in you for life and no amount of healing can mend that.  There would always be a scar that would be there forever.    Yes I know, physical pain can also give you scars.  But those scars won't hurt after they've healed already.  It would just be a vivid memory, something you will laugh at everytime you will see it.  But with those hurtful words, the scars still stings everytime they are remembered.  Those words will haunt you even when you thought that you are over it.  Words will make you suffer, and it's that pain that will never be over.    Words.  They really hurt.  Honestly, I would rather get hurt physically than to suffer psychological hurt.  It would be really hard to recover from that than the physical one.  At least the wounds that I will get physically, I will be able to see it heal.  With hurtful words, you really wonder when you will be okay with that.    I had my share of psychological trauma because of the hurtful words I recieve from people.  And honestly, eventhough I think I look okay right now, there would be a time when those words that had hurt me would resurface and it would trigger the pain that I had.    So next time you say something, make sure you think twice before letting out that thought in your head.  You may  never know that you will be scarring someone for life if you are not careful.

      I got a chance to spend some time with a bunch of old college friends of mine.  And it's really great to know that after all these years, they would still be there for you no matter what.  It's really great to meet up with old friends again.  It's really a great feeling.  Most of the comments I got from my friends is that I haven't change, physically.  They have seen me grow into a somewhat mature individual when I was in college but how I look to them is still the same.  I did change they said.  I'm not that silent and just nod in agreement everytime they decide on something.  I have become a little bitchy...to Becca it's a good thing because it means (to her) that they wouldn't just push me around anymore.  But they say that I haven't changed in the way I look.  They say that I'm still look like their college barkada without the overgrown shirts and cap.  But still I still look like a college freshman.  It's kinda refreshing actually...to know that I still look young despite the fact that I don't really feel like I'm that young anymore.  I guess "maturity" does that to a person.  Anyway, I had found out that I had missed my friends a lot.  And I'm really happy that I have seen them and got a  chance to hang out with them again....I wish I can do that more often.

      Hohum...after two weeks of anticipating whether or not my boy Kimi would actually win another race, well let's just say I'm disappointed again.  Yes, it wasn't his fault.&nbsp; The rear wing just flew after a good pitstop.&nbsp; It ended his race before he was really starting.&nbsp; The engines were good, the chasis were bad.&nbsp; And honestly I wonder why.  So this year, instead of actually winning races like he was suppose to be doing, he's had one crash after another.&nbsp; Again, it wasn't his fault.&nbsp; He's really a good driver, but bad luck after another has cost him so much that he's not in the running for Championship unlike last year and the year before that.  In another aspect, Hockenheim isn't the place where you will see him at his best even if he starts at his best.&nbsp; He hasn't finished a race in Hockenheim eversince he started racing in F1.&nbsp; Even when he was in Sauber, he didn't finish the race there:  2001 - retired: Driveshaft 2002 - retired: spun 2003 - retired: Accident 2004 - retired: rear wing failure  I have this strange feeling that he's cursed never to finish a race in Hockenheim.&nbsp; While he's really good in racing, if Lady Luck isn't with you during races, the chances of you winning is really close to 0.  My poor Kimi.&nbsp; What can you do to actually salvage this season?

      For the passed few months my body has already started getting the hang of the schedule that I had eversince working again.&nbsp; I've gotten used to the fact that I have gotten more sleep and more exercise than I what I had gotten used to growing up.&nbsp; Oh well, now I have to go back to&nbsp;getting the lack of sleep and still be one hundred percent at my best.  Sleep has become a luxury yet again.&nbsp; It's not entirely bad though.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just one hour off my usual waking hours.&nbsp; But still that one hour short of sleep will really take it's toll on me in the future.  One thing good about this new schedule is that I have more hours to myself in the office than if I'm on my usual schedule.&nbsp; It gives me more time to actually be myself, work on the papers that I need to do, write the articles that I need to write and more time to actually do stuff that I wouldn't normally do since I would be looking around if my boss would be standing right behind me or not.  Well, I guess I have to sacrifice some stuff to get to where I am right now.&nbsp; But honestly, right now, I really need sleep. -_-

      I was watching Smallville last night and I thought it was just pretty boring until the last scene where Clark and Lex were talking about another version of the interpretation of the cave paintings.  Lex said that if a person has the strenght of 10 men and can shoot fire out of his eyes he can be the most powerful man on earth.  He might even end up being a tyrrant.  The person who will try to challenge him is a very courageous man just to put him to right.  What Lex said really made sense to me that time.  I mean, what if there was no Lex Luthor to keep thinking of diabolical things to destroy Superman?  With all those powers and no one to use them against, surely the Man of Steel would have thought of other ways to use them...say rule the world?  Whenever there is a good guy there should always be a bad guy to balance things out.  But what if the good guy isn't the one with the super human abilities?  What if he's just an ordinary human being whose only power is his influence over so many things trying to stop this super being who comes to destroy the world?  Lex has a good point that the bad guy might not really be the destroyer of this super being but the super being himself.   Without Lex to do check and balance, the Man of Steel would surely use his powers to do a lot of bad things just to get what he wants.  If there wasn't a Lex Luthor who gives Superman a hard time, thinking of ways to retaliate where would our man of steel be? Will he really be this good guy everybody loves?  Lex has a really good point last night.  It would take a really brave man to go head to head with a man with the strength of 10 men.  But head to head he did hence the arch rivalry between Superman and Lex Luthor.  If you think about it, Lex is the hero because he sacrificed being good just so that Superman wouldn't turn evil.  Criminal mastermind? I think not, but a mastermind he is.  And a brave one at that. =)  Superman has always been depicted as the good guy, the boyscout, Mr. Truth-Justice in the American Way.  But if you think about it, if Lex Luther wasn't there to make him depict the boyscout image, Superman would just be one of your average super villain.  Hmm...Superman, a bad guy...that is not such a bad idea. =)  What do you think?

             Hmm...well a lot of my friend know that I have a huge crush on this guy. I just found out that he got married yesterday.  Though it really saddens me that Kimi Raikkonen is married and not to me (as if I had a chance in the first place =p) I'm also happy for him. At least he found his special someone who he can live the rest of his life with. And that even if he wouldn't win the WC title this year, he knows that Jenni would still be there for him.      CONGRATULATIONS TO KIMI RAIKKONEN AND JENNI DAHLMAN!!! YOUR FANS ARE HAPPY FOR THE BOTH OF YOU!!!
