       WOW, i had never really watched Gilmore Girls before last night, but I must admit its an oddly compelling show. I have a large head so I should not really talk but it seems to me that the daughter has a forehead out of Frankenstein or something. I placed small bets with myself to see if any point she would make a sudden movement and fall over on herself.   You know what`s diffferent about NBA playoff coverage in the US and abroad? The commentators have a lot more fun in the US. I am one of the few who enjoy Bill Walton for example. Last night, I did a lot of Walton imitations while watching Spurs-Mavs game 6..."RAEF LAFRENTZ, Throw it DOOWN BIG MAN" etc. I also really enjoy the snerk that Van Gundy and Fratello throw at each other on TNT. Like when Jeff throws in some comments about interviewing for this job or speaking with LeBron on the phone and the Czar works really hard to remind everyone he is also a coach who is available for interviews.     DUMB AMERICAN EXPERIENCE OF THE DAY   Last nite on my way home from work, I noticed I had missed the bus and had to cab it. I spent about an hour in a cab with this dude trying to figure out how to navigate through Itaim (the neighborhood i live in) which seems to be all one ways that go in ways I don`t want to go. At one point I figured he was trying to screw the dumb american out of some money but he knocked 8R$ off the tab which was about right so maybe he]s just dumb. Oddly enough, the trip did expose to me that there is an Irish pub about 1/2 a mile from my flat. Bangers and mash anyone?  Once I figure out how to post pictures on here. I will try to post pics of the Office I work in which is interesting because its an incredibly nice office complex with about 7 high rises that are on a border with some of the most depressing looking slums you can imagine. Apparently this is very common here.

       Oui from Brazil or Ahlo i suppose which some people also get away with. for a long time I was updating  urlLink this site  with info but that is not really likely with my current limitations at work. anyway, new feature   DUMB AMERICAN MOVE OF THE DAY   walked into a tapas restaurant last nite hoping to find some people speaking spanish to spare myself getting laughed out of a restaurant again. I placed an order and got a plate of cold cuts when i expected something more closely resembling, you know, tapas. Whatever my fault. I put on my old school adkins hat and ate a plate of ham and salami...um...yum?

       we might need a clarification: is it sleave or sleeve? Or is just evolving over time, like language in general? Very nice   Festa Junina   I want to tell you all about my saturday but its a blur, I remember the part about running in the park and I remember walking into a clothing store and nearly getting talked into buying a shirt that was too small in the shoulders from the hotest girl ever with red highlights. I also recall starting the evening with myself and the Charles River Bandit hustling out of the house and heading to some chick's apartment in Morumbi. It should be pointed out that everyone here lives with their parents till they get married. I mention this not because it is relevant to my story but rather because its one of those interesting cultural differences which is subtle but kind of important. She is the friend of a friend of CRB's and we were all (me, CRB, his friend, and his friend's friend) going to go to a Festa Junina Party at a country club that someone was a member  of. What is Festa Junina you ask? Well, it seems like it can best be described as a Hoe Down or something, right down to the honky talk band. There are also a lot of people walking around in stentsons and what not (although more than once I was amused to see people wearing Titlest golf hats and trying to fit in. hah! Country club people across the world unite). I asked repeated what Fest Junina was about and I got all sorts of answers from "some sort of celebration of a saint" to "a typical brazilian party that people in the country celebrate" to "it comes from the north" to "the celebration of the saint of weddings either Paulo or Antonio" to finally "I really don't know". The point was I was at a country club at a hoe down and there was square dancing and everything and at one point I turned to myself and said "christian, you are having great fun and all, but this is a hoe down in a country club. When did you sell out?" and i turned back to myself and said "friend, I sold out a long time ago. Kick back and enjoy it, babe". I then stepped away from the mirror and bought some hot wine. Again, I noticed with glee when the crowd roared as the music switched between Creedance Clearwater Revival towards Chubby Checker and then the music lost all consistency, which was fine by me.   After a while, I noticed things were awkward, then I realized it was just me. People here are all about random eye contact. People are always making eye contact. Looking across the dance floor you can make eye contact 10 times and it means nothing. Very odd. By 3, the event was dying down and we decided to investigate another party which was occuring near my place, someone had closed off the court yard and was having a huge party to celebrate the same event. It was great fun, but I was exhausted. PDA is pretty common by the way and CRB pointed it out to me constantly. I started taking note of some of it hoping to spy some girl on girl action. Instead i spotted this one incredibly tall, kinda of chubby girl making out with this dude quite intensely and jamming her hands down her pants. WOW! What!? Crazy. around 430 I realized I was almost asleep on my feet drinking hot wine and found my other party friends sitting somewhere near the stage, probably contemplating their pained feet. We agreed we were thru and that was it.

        A roof-top keg party is fine in theory... I just completely underestimated the effort it would take to get a keg to the roof of a five-story walk-up apartment building. It must be the fact that the only times i ever try to lift a keg, is at the end of a party, as the last drops of beer are sputtering out of the tap... I'll give it a slight tug out of it's ice water bucket and as it sloshes around a bit with ease, i'll say something like, "yup, I think it's floated." and let my hangover ensue....   An interesting fact : a full keg apparently weighs in the ballpark of an awkward 150 pounds.  Thus, Evil came to the first, and last, roof-top keg party at my place... It started out as a pot-luck dinner. here were the items brought:   Greek salad  Cupcakes  Large cheese pizza  vegatarian hot dogs     My friend Libby was moving to Spain, so that was the party's occasion. So one of her friends brought, in addition to 100 jelloshots, a bag full of various t-shirts with photos of libby's on them. So Libby, myself, and about 20 other people were wearing shirts with her likeness on them. I gave her a Sharpie, and the party frequently turned into a highschool-yearbook-signing-flashback-moment as she signed people's shirts all night. I'll fill in more details as I'm reminded.  I haven't felt right all day. I woke up at 9:00am, back to sleep at 10:30am, woke at 12:45am, left the house, got a bagel, fell asleep at 2:00pm, woke up at 7:30pm, it's 1:30am now, my headache is still not gone.... minus 30 on my FA index for today.

        Evil  SATURDAY OBSERVATIONS   One.  My friend called to say she's running a little late and I say no sweat, I'll be waiting for you at 70th and Lex. I brought a book with me, some John Cheever because I am trying to be a more serious person, and I lean against the corner of a building to begin on chapter 4. Of course, I don't lean on the corner itself because who wants the corner of a building pointing right into your back; I lean against one of the flats but very close to the corner and before I am two paragraphs into chapter 4, people are running in to me. Sometimes they say sorry and sometimes I say sorry, but it is clear that both parties are annoyed, where the "sorry" is really a proxy for "fuck you, dickwad." I am thinking to myself, who are these people that they need to cut the corner so close? Are they Jeff Gordon? This is New York City and it seems to me that cutting a corner so closely is a dangerous proposition, I mean, someone, anyone, could easily have built a little wooden jig, stuck oh, a bayonette in it, and stationed it snugly at the corner of a block. I'm pretty sure that people would impale themselves at the rate of one a minute. I might toss this idea to one of those hidden camera shows.   Two.  I can't get the terrorists out of my mind... specifically, those al-Qaeda training videos that they show on the news, where terrorist trainees are running an obstacle course in a desert somewhere, you know those videos, right?, and you've seen the part where the trainees are doing the monkey bars, right? MONKEY BARS? I can't get over how training on monkey bars is so unpractical for today's terrorism. I mean, when was the last time you, or anyone, had to navigate a set of monkey bars in New York City? The way I figure it, they should set up some subway turn-styles to duck under, some police barricades to hop over, and for good measure, a maze of velvet ropes to weave in and out of. Or whatever.   Three.  Huge props to SLEAVE for really knowing how to throw a party on a roof. I am pretty sure I freaked out at least two girls there (WHY? I wish I knew!) but I managed to make it thru the nite without getting punched in the face. Which is not to say that EVERYONE was so lucky. SLEAVE has pictures! After my failed attempts at conversation with the C programmer girl from the Museum of Natural History and the girl wearing a t-shirt that had her own face on it ("Oh wait, that's NOT a picture of you?"... "No, it's not. You can't tell?"... "No".... "Are you serious?"... "Yes"... "Wow"... "Well, all white people look alike to me."), I found a better audience with some dude who might or might not have been Uday Hussein in a tan blazer.

        Open questions  How many points do you loose off the Falling Apart Index if you start crying during a repeat of the season finale of  Gilmore Girls   Say you cut yourself shaving in the morning (a lot, and for no reason at all...you almost loose a pint of blood) and you start blaming your dad (who is know in some circles as the  Crazy Conejo Man ) responsible for not teaching you how to shave, do you loose points off the FA Index for that?

        Snoop gone Wild   Snoop and "Girls Gone Wild" have ended their relationship. Apparenlty, Snoop is angry they aren't giving sisters enough love. I agree with Snoop, however I am unsure how many sisters there are in Panama City Florida...Also, I dunno, someone might have to fix me on this, but I am pretty sure that being a woman of color would prevent you from being  white trash . Thank god for  urlLink www.BangBus.com , which takes diversity much more seriously. Read about it  urlLink here

        Hammered   Last night, Endeavor had a happy hour and I rolled in with the boss. I knocked back about 8 choppis and sat there picking at some meat grilling on a little grill in front of me. I am going to guess its called  Poquino , but i am unsure.  All the eMBAs were there so it was pretty easy to get hammered. I was still a little hung over from the 7 Ciapirinhas (with sake and Kiwi, yum, yes its quite a poofy drink...leave me alone) from the night before so drinking was no where near as good an idea as I thought. Some chick there pretended she knew me from somewhere and I was only able to play along for about 5 minutes because i was drunk and had never been to San Diego.  Eventuallly the Santos v Boca match came on and i watched some brazilians and argentinians call each other  putas  for 2 hours. I staggered out of the bar around 1230 with the Charles River Bandit in tow as we were walking towards a McDonalds (btw, McDonalds F*CK U!! for being where ever I get drunk...) The scene in the parking lot was straight out of the  2FAST 2FURIOUS  so we decided to skip it. I staggered back to the hotel and had a rather loud conversation in poor portuguese with the bell hop about getting a fold out bed for my bud. That did not work out and i ended up on my couch watching some public access porn. I fell asleep thinking this was exactly what living in NY was like for 4 years and got slightly sad.    This morning I woke up slightly nasueus and kind of laughing at the Charles River Bandit, who passed out on my floor. I meditate on the fact that sleeping on floors and eating after midnight are cause to lose 5-10 pts a piece in the FA Index. I would also like to point out to  sleave  that whip its etc should be about a 25 pt deduction.

        Evil  I've had a lot on my mind lately and one of those things is canned tuna fish. There's been a can of Bumblebee sitting on top of fridge for the last three months. I can't remember how it got there in the first place but all I know is that it looks a little out of place and that kind of stuff tends to bother me more than it would bother your average person. But even so, I never worked up the energy to move the can into the cupboard.  My apartment has been in the process of running out of food for a week now. It's like the fuel gauge in your car... it can be on "E" but you know there's gotta be something left. It's all a matter of degrees until you're really REALLY out. In the past week, I've found myself being quite pleased at scrounging up goodies like: half a bag of dried cranberries, a bar of semi-sweet baking chocolate, some pine nuts, a Powerbar, 4 slices of bacon, and almost an entire Chorizo. Good deal!  Today, I figured out that actually eating the contents of the tuna fish can would be a Win-Win: I wouldn’t need to fret over moving it any more... and also, I would be eating something. But then it occurred to me: HOW DOES THE TUNA STAY FRESH IN THAT CAN??? I mean, it's about 93 degrees and humid today. And also, it's FISH. Surely, that's not a good combination. I opened the can and sure enough, it smelled and tasted good as new. Who knew??? HOW DO THEY DO THAT? I am currently baffled by this situation.   (Note: This was written yesterday but I couldn't post it because Blogger was down.)

        Evil  Just because I haven't posted today (until now), you might be relieved to know it's not because I couldn't muster enough motivation to roll out of bed. I assure you, I wasn't curled into the fetal position all morning and afternoon listening to Stern, followed by The Michael Kay Show on 1050am, followed by Mike and the Mad Dog on WFAN. That was yesterday. Today, my God Fearing Indian Friend is in town from Philly so we met up for breakfast. I wasted little time in hitting her up for  urlLink Friendster  friend-of-a-friend linkage, but all she gave me was a dirty look when I asked her if Jesus Christ is on her friends list. I need to link up to a better group of friends because judging by my current crew, you'd easily mistaken the site for Clownster or something to that effect.  (BTW- I had more to say about the COB's metrosexuality --HAHAHA-- but my original post was lost because either Blogger or God, or both, hates me.)

        MetroSexual  and Proud  I have gotten this urlLink  article   from this past Sunday's NY Times emailed to me three times so far. It was funny the first time then began to approach insulting. Guys, I have socks with holes in them. I can show you! Anyway, I figured I would share thoughts.  Apparently, everyone has assigned me to this customer segment and after much internal debate I now embrace this  non-gay  definition of me.  What is a metrosexual? Apparently its just a dude who doesnt think sweatpants are appropriate for any given occasion. It has nothing to do with sexuality, so the name is probably ill suited. Anyway, like I said nothing to do with sexuality so straight guys like me (and gay guys like EVIL) can all be part of the team.   The article lists the Bumpasaurus' boyfriend, Mr Posh Spice aka David Beckham, as the poster child of this crowd. Meanwhile, if you want a closer look a this crowd, you should check in with Sparkes. He is clearly ahead of me in line...

       Wanted to send this official email announcing the birth of my son, Charles William Elliott. He was born on June 19 at 8:30 in the morning. He weighed in at a hefty 8 pounds 15 ounces and was 21 inches long. To those of you outside the loop, this has been a long anticipated event. I am very happy to have him here and I wait anxiously for the day when he will start to look like me. As it stands, he is currently a combination of Nicole and the mailman we had back east. Needless to say, I will be monitoring this situation closely. For those of you who know me best, you might want to save some cash for my bail…..just in case.  He has shown strong signs of being an Elliott though. Just a few minutes ago, he blew his pamper out in a way only a shit taking connoisseur like my self could appreciate. Plus the fact that he keeps strange hours and always wants to suck on some titties. So, eat, shit suck titties then sleep. Yeah, we sound related.  Again for those of you outside the loop, I’m currently residing in Southern California (Not LA) and living a suburban lifestyle. It’s a nice change form the city and I spend most the majority of the time trying to convince my neighbors that the property values of their condos are not decreasing due to the fact that I’ve moved into the neighborhood but because the country as whole is going through a bad patch. But seriously, for the most part people have been nice. I’ve managed to find some friends who feel comfortable enough around me to say that they’d like to, ‘see a brother out on a surfboard’.  I’m guessing they have yet to receive a copy of ‘Your new black friend’ I suspect that the post office too is going through a bad patch. For those of you who know me (especially Ed) you know that the chances of seeing me on a surfboard is just as likely as seeing a Yeti. By the way, I saw one. It’s currently hiding out in NYC. Nicole won’t let me capture it. Damn her, we could use that reward money.  I plan to chronicle my adventures out here. I just have to have some. I’m not sure, but I think it might mean my leaving the house.   Later, you people.

        Evil  At one point while we were seniors in college, the COB pointed out to me that had we chosen to major in IEOR instead of CS, we could have done a Visual Arts minor on the side and STILL come out of college with the same job offers that we had. I blame this all on my academic advisor. A GOOD academic advisor should have said something like this:   Evil (freshman year): I'm thinking of majoring in CS. Advisor: Okay?... Don't you want any poontang, kid? CS is good and all, but I'm just sayin'... Evil: There's no coochie in CS? Advisor: Well, there are, but they're all Orthodox Jewish poon. I don't think you're gonna get near any of that stuff. Evil: I also want a good job when I graduate. Advisor: IEOR, kid. Go IEOR. Evil: I can get some in IEOR? Advisor: No. But that's where the Visual Arts minor comes in. Those girls will do you in the name of art. And they're pretty smokin' too. Evil: NICE. (You can also replace Evil with the COB in this conversation. Everything would probably go the same, except, instead of saying "NICE" the COB would do the head nod and scratch his chin.)   Why am I dredging up this old stuff? It's not because I'm bitter (HAHAHA). Actually, it's because I came up with this great idea and I'm applying for a grant from the National Endowment of the Arts to carry through with it. Picture this...  Every day for the next 3 years, I will take a picture of myself. Naturally, over time, the pictures will show me falling apart in various and sometimes disturbing ways. HOWEVER, when I display the pictures, I will arrange then in reverse chronological order. The viewer will think that I'm actually putting myself together... but after the last (really the first) picture, there will be some note about the reverse order. I think that's powerful stuff. In anticipation of receiving the NEA grant, I'm running out and buying a beret.

       here's one for the Post's 'Only in New York, Kids' column. I somehow managed to work until 2:00am, and still wake up with a splitting hangover...  i mean, the bars are closing at that time in most other cities. hazy recap:  2:15 -- leave work in cab and meet some friends that had just seen Hulk (4 out of 5 liked it) and been drinking since 11:00pm at 7B bar. 2:30-3:15am -- down three pints of cheap beer while playing T3 pinball. 3:15am -- tequila shot. 3:30am -- another pint and vintage photo booth. 3:45am -- party of about myself and 4 other move to my apartment, about 2 blocks away, to smoke, and stumble upon a SWIFA worse than Evil, in my unemployed roommate. The floor is littered in little empty nitros cartridges and a whipped cream dispenser. SWIFA and friend are passed out. I'm handed a cheap Mexican beer in a can from my fridge. 4:15am -- SWIFA's friend's professional theater fog machine, that has somehow managed to used my livingroom for it's storage, gets plugged in. 4:20am -- my apartment has a visibility of 4 inches. 5:00am -- apartment still has remnants of fog. a couple of friends playing an Othello boardgame in the corner, another friend and a revive SWIFA have spontanious guitar duet/ song-writing session, a random neighbor who appeared after the 80's tunes were turned up too loud is wondering around hitting on the two girls, someone is cooking quasadillas, another random friend is buzzing the buzzer after drinking at bars until 5, correctly assuming someone would still be awake there. I am still drinking a warm Mexican beer in a can, that i'm certain is not the one i originally had. 6:30am -- somehow the sun is up, and we had watched Office Space on the projector. i crawl into bed.

A few months ago I read that Demi spent 200K in cosmetic surgery, after seeing the trailer for  Charlies Angels Full Throttle  yesterday in front of 2 Fast 2 Furious   Yesterday I could see where it all went, she looked amazing but damn, she's still 40 and he's still the dude who "created"  Punk'd  and was in  Dude, Where's my car . I just realized that  I am not sure who in this whole thing is disturbing me more.

        Evil  Is anyone else freaking out over their Heaven application? I'm actually putting some decent work into this thing because the last thing I want is to be wait-listed. Hate being in limbo like that. Not really sure what to do about the recommendations. One needs to come from a direct ancestor. Both my parents hate me. One needs to come from a peer. All my friends hate me (after all, I don't have "real friends," like some people). In any event, I am padding the Good Deeds sections by passing along this public service announcement of the day...  If your legs are ever sore, say after a workout or a run, and you find yourself in CVS looking to buy a hot water bottle to loosen up the muscles, be sure to look carefully at the packaging of the hot water bottle:    See? The first one is a regular hot water bottle. The second one is a very similar looking thing, except that it's a DOUCHE and ENEMA kit. DUDE. NOW WHAT???

        Evil  As much as I want it to be like 1998 again, it's clear that things have changed. Mr. Shoulders got his nickname because back in the day, he could easily be mistaken for an Indian Tim Hardaway, built like a bull and flashing a killer crossover. To my surprise, Mr. Shoulders comes back from London all trimmed down. Don't get me wrong --he's not gayishly thin, like an ex-collegiate-swimmer we might know-- just lean and mean. Actually, just lean. What happened to the meanness? The rage against women? The white-knuckled fist cocked and ready to knock the lipstick right off someone's face? This was a new Mr. Shoulders and I demanded to know why:  "Are you just off your game tonite?" I asked. "No... I'm not really into this scene anymore," he told me. "Are you GAY?" He replied with a calm "No," and nothing more.  WHAT? Where is the defensive "Nooooo!" following by the crazy flexing of the shoulders and delts a la The Hulkster? I need to get to the bottom of this. My going theory is that Mr. Shoulders now has a Knightsbridge or South Kensington young lady that he answers to. Everyone reading this should help full court press the issue.

       Its good to see that 3/4 of Team Rachel is getting together in NY. Give Manolo's best to the bouncers at Flashdancers.   To this day, the most disturbing evening I have ever had (where no one actually got hurt or called me a bad person anyway) was the night myself and EVIL walked into Mr Shoulder's dorm room in Furnald Hall to watch the HBO film "Gia" starring a young and pre-freaky Angelina Joile.  To recap it went something like this  [disturbing rape scene...Gia is trying to score heroin and gets raped and punched in the stomach] Mr Shoulders [fist pumping in the air, screaming at the top of his lungs]: Yeah thats what she gets...  [EVIL and X-tian shoot either looks and try to find the nearest exit]  who cheers rape scenes? very odd....   Completely Unrelated  I ate something that did a number on my stomach a few days ago. Yesterday it was so bad I had to go home early and pass out. I had something of a fever dream I figure I would share it now   The dream is me, more or less, in my parents old home in Perth Amboy, which has somehow been moved to Florida. I am in some sort of state, trying to get myself organized because I am moving apartments in NY of all places. Somehow or another my apartment in Astoria has ended up in Washington Heights, along with my roommates...and when I finally get back to the apartment I realize that it is completely empty because I moved out some time ago.     What? What?

        Evil     Mr. Shoulders is in town. Ladies of NYC, watch out! Hanging out with Mr. Shoulders reminds me of  Swingers  sometimes.   MIKE: She didn't like me anyway.  TRENT: She thought you were money.  MIKE: I don't think so.  TRENT: I heard them talking. They both thought you were money.  MIKE: Yeah, a good friend.  TRENT: Baby, you take your self out of the game. You start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream, of course it's gonna be on the friend tip.   I guess the moral of the story here is that you should always look to paperbag a girl's head, and if she's a heroin freak, then it's OK to punch her in the stomach too. I learned that from Mr. Shoulders.

        Evil  Even though I am Someone Who Is Falling Apart, I still find time to enjoy watching other people throw away their dignity. Thank goodness for reality TV. Did anyone else catch  Anything For Love  on FOX last nite? Man, those people were train wrecks. For SWIFA, this stuff is better than heroin.  Speaking of falling apart, I picked up  How To Lose Friends and Alienate People  from the bookstore today. It's a memoir about some dude who goes thru a rough patch. From the back cover:   High-flying British journalist Toby Young set out for New York to become a contributing editor at Vanity Fair. Other Brits had taken Manhattan, so why couldn't he?    But things didn't go according to plan. Within the space of two years he was fired from Vanity Fair, banned from the most fashionable bar in the city, and couldn't get a date for love or money. Even the local AA group wanted nothing to do with him.   ------  Toby Young was born in 1963. In the course of his career as a journalist he has been fired from a succession of prestigous newspapers and magazines, including the Times of London, the Guardian, the Independent, and Vanity Fair. He lives in London.   Lastly, and completely unrelated, I just want to mention that as I was walking thru the park today, I saw two dogs humping ferociously.

       i forgot to mention something odd I saw. Last night I went to get a haircut. The barber realized that my portuguese was pretty bad and we would not be chatting very much, so he handed me a stack of brazilian playboys to read while he cut. One thing I noticed is that blonde women dont all shave their legs here. Some might bleach them (???) because its very light. I noticed this the other day while going up SugarLoaf and mentioned as much to CRB, who agreed he had seen it before. Once I saw it in Playboy, I figured that it must be pretty normal. Which is odd I think, not because I got some issue or whatever, but because isn't a brazilian wax a very intensive process to remove a lot of hair from certain areas? I assumed it was named so because people in brazil came up with the process. If this is the case, then wouldn't leg shaving be far more prominent? I dunno...whatever....   As an FYI, my haircut doesn't not resemble Joey Tribianni right now. Considering the language barrier myself and marquoz had to overcome I will chalk that up as a win.

       I just read that sopranos won't start again till March. That's very strange because I thought the whole reason it started so late last year was because it was plotting the next two seasons of the show. This vexes me. I personally like the idea of starting the show within a year of the end of the season preceding it. I dunno that just might be me. Any momentum generated by the season before is basically disappaited. Do I have to go watch the season before in the weeks leading up to the new season? Will the new season pick up 18 months after Tony and Carmela decide to get a divorce? There are teen type people on that show, AJ might be 22 or something at the end of next season, how will that get explained?  Very odd....

        Evil  Hi everyone. I hope everyone had a good weekend being that it was Father's Day and how nice it must be to have a father who loves you. OOPS, nipping potential digression early on. That's not what I wanted to post about. What I wanted to say is...  The block that I live on is pretty low key and out of the way. Aside from a small row of pre-wars, there is a Korean dry cleaner, an auto body shop, and a depot for the city street cleaning trucks. You've seen the street cleaning trucks in New York, right? They are the  hulking vehicles with spinning brushes and a water spritzer on the underside. I peeked inside the depot one day and was impressed by the complex structure of ramps needed to house all those street cleaning trucks in a relatively small space. What I can't figure out is... with all the street cleaning trucks leaving and re-entering my block, why is my street SO FREAKING DIRTY? And I don't just mean messy. I've been to Big Head's Washington Heights digs. His street was messy by virtue of having uncollected garbage bags everywhere, but it wasn't necessarily  dirty . My street is legitimately dirty, with a thick coating of dirty and grime on the street. Why? Why? My street is dirtier than Christina Aguilera. It's a mystery. If anyone can get to the bottom of this, there might be a doctorial thesis in it for you.  BTW- Does the sports moratorium cover professional wrestling? Because, you know, wrestling is officially "sports entertainment." Wooooooo! WHAT? Wooooooooo! WHAT?

        Notes from Rio Trip  Got on a friday nite plane from SP to Rio de Janerio (pronounced HEE-O JANERO) on a TAM flight (pronounced TA) operated by VARIG (pronounced VARGI....someone shoot me).  Me and the Charles River Bandit (CBR for short) checked into the Excelsior Copacaba and then went looking for eats, we started walking the wrong way and came across a bunch of hookers, which i guess amused the concierge when we ran back to the hotel because she was lauging at us. I ate far too much Sushi and Rodizio at this place in Ipanema and got ripped off of 2 incredibly strong Ciapiriahas (sp?) The next day we hooked up with CRB's friends and did typical touristy stuff (Corcovado, Pao de Azucar etc)   One funny side note, the crowd at this club we were at, almost started roaring with enthusiasm whent he DJ popped on Rick Ashtley. I suspect that brazilians in general, though great fans of american pop culture have no sense of american kitsch. No one seemed terribly amused by my "Rick Ashtley/Miguel Cruz" shoulder dance with finger snaps, maybe I need to be wearing a sports coat which I could pull down to elbows for added effect. Oddly enough, X-tian's game is just as limited in the southern hemisphere as it is in the northern one. I did not bust out the "do you find my american passport sexy" move though, thats next.  While going up sugar loaf i found myself starring at a chick that jordan from G string Divas hot.  CRB promptly pointed out that she might be 14 years old and suddenly I realized that there may yet be a place for the BEF COUNTER (FYI BEF COUNTER:00000000000000000000)

        a few thoughts.....   where's the respect for the nets...why does everyone on espn think the spurs are so much better...the series is 2-2 and k-mart has outplayed the so-called mvp in all but one game....the only reason tony parker was scoring 20 is because jkidd was playing zone while everyone else was manned up...jkidd let him drive at will..cob could've hit a couple of those runners....tim duncan is soft..  today is the olsen  twins seventeenth birthday...   i just had a conversation with cobarrera@hotmail.com.....turns out he is an eually proportioned cob....just not our cob  i caught Good Day live the other day and gillain barberie conducted an interview with a blubbery mess called terry bradshaw from his lap, consoling him with her chest...is he a big girl or smarter then i thought?   i want to throw up whenever anybody mentions sammy sosa and rascism ....  david beckam is worth the 52 milllion dollars real madrid is going to pay for him...my only regret over the move is north america will no longer be able to wake up to him on saturdays...damn the cost of spanish league broascasting rights!

        Evil   OPEN LETTER TO MY FRIENDS I hate you all. I wish I had "real friends," like Mr. Shoulders does. How many times have I casually mentioned that "I'm going to drink myself into a hole"? People, I am practically begging for an intervention here. Let me recap for you yesterday's shenanigans:  1. Woke up at around noon. 2. Ate a piece of bread. The label read "Packaged on May 30." Yesterday was June 12. WHAT? 3. Ran 10 miles. 4. Rushed over to Columbia to crash the business school's Thursday night happy hour at Uris Hall. 5. Quickly downed 4 beers. (Free beer. Woooo!) Should have eaten more than just a piece of bread during the day. 6. Went home and stumbled into bed. 7. Woke up repeatedly in the middle of the night due to being bitten by bed mites. This is what happens when you wash the sheets but dont actually put the sheets back on the bed for 5 days (and running).  Just to recap... Friends: you suck. Hahahha.

        The Hose  I think impacted feces is allieviated by running marathons. Apparently people loose control of their bowels at the 15 mile marker.  Don't get too attached to your shorts.  There is this guy I know...maybe I am related to him...maybe not. The one fight he has been in that I know about was with a dude that had just finished running a marathon. Apparently, the dude got clocked.  There is a life lesson in there for anyone who thinks EVIL runs his mouth off in the fantasy baseball league.  EVIL, you should give up this wack dream of selling enterprise software and pursue your life dream of reviewing talk radio shows.

        Evil  Getting a late start today. I spent the morning lying in bed and listening to Stern, which has really started to disturb me lately. They keep running this commercial for the Puristat Internal Body Cleanser. They run that commercial during  every  break and every time I hear it, I start fretting about what impacted feces matter might or might not be lodged in my intestines. I hate that commercial. It's accelerating my mental breakdown.  A few other thoughts for the day:  1. Yo Big Head, when did I write off the Nets? This is your revisionist history at work again. Check your IM logs. Or maybe you were confused, because I might have been writing off the Knicks all week.  2. Has anyone else noticed that Art Howe says the gayest things? During spring training, he was talking to a group of reporters and said something like, "Have you touched Mo [Vaughn]? He's completely hard." Silence from all the reporters, after which, Howe laughed it off. And just yesterday, I was listening to Mike and the Mad Dog. It went something like this:  Mike: Hey Art, let's start with the good news first. How 'bout that kid Reyes? Art: He's something, isn't he? Mike: Well, we know one thing... He sure is fast. Art: He sure is. And how 'bout his hose?  I was like, WHAT? Mike and Mad Dog didn't know what to make of this either. Apprently, "his hose" was a reference to his throwing arm. DUDE... I've never heard that term used before. I'm just going to assume it was a gay Freudian slip.  3. Has anyone noticed the ads at the top of this site? In case you didn't already know, those ads are powered by Google's "Content Targeting Advertising" feature. Google's ad engine tries to determine what this site is all about and place relevant ads. So far, it looks like this site is confusing the heck out of Google. I'm just waiting for the gay-related ads to come on because, let's face it, it's just a matter of time.  4. On a personal note... Results of the NYC Marathon entry lottery were posted yesterday and I am in. Wooooo. Does anyone know how long a marathon is? I should probably find out at some point.  Yo Chuck, you in NYC? I am. And I am not generally busy except for drinking myself into a hole and lamenting about being in a rough patch. Other that, I am just chillin.

        The Ship Not be Sinking!!  Everyone (well mostly guys named Evil and Chuck) have been writing off the Nets all week...The series was set to be 3-1 and over. There were all the fans on their feet unsure whether to cheer, wearing retro Dr J, ABA  style Nets jerseys that you can get at the jersey gardens mall a stones throw away, with the tags still on in case the Nets lost. But there was Richard Jefferson playing above the rim, put on afro on him and I confuse him for a young Dr. J, put a stutter on him and I confuse him for Michael Ray Ricardson(pre coke head version) There was J Kidd dropping an almost triple double and chasing around that freaky limbed argentinian all around the court. There was Mutombo, all elbows and chest, doing what they traded the big weak white guy for him to do, moving Duncan and D Rob around under the basket, grabbing big rebounds and altering shots. There was K Mart, in one sequence getting blocked twice before finally getting the foul called, battling, wanting it more than anyone (shawn bradley?, Derrick Coleman? Joe Barry Carroll? Sam Bowie? Darryl "chocolate thunder" Dawkins?) than anyone who played in the paint at the meadowlands ever did.  Screw you CHUCK!!

        Evil  While making my way to the Yankee game last nite, I found myself on a very crowded uptown 4 train because I managed to wedge into a little spot right near the door opening. Unfortunately, a rather rotund woman had the same idea so I ended up spending the ride with my front pressed against the hand rail of the two-seater, and my backside slathering against the sweaty big woman. Here's the thing tho... the hand rail was right against my bits and pieces, and with all the rubbing, there was some arousal happening. It felt a little inappropriate because the person sitting down was one of those hardcore Orthodox Jewish girls. She probably didn't appreciate having a thing that close to her face, but what was I supposed to do?  One observation from the game itself... I saw some dude wearing a Steve Balboni jersey. Damn. Which made me wonder real hard if that dude was Steve Balboni himself. I mean, really, who would own a Steve Balboni jersey anyway?

       CHEO recently decided to put me and EVIL in our place about this whole Sammy Situation. It was well thought out and accurate (as opposed to most things posted on this blog) He seems a little worked up about this, but I suspect he had just read EVIL's recap of the Puerto Rican Day Parade and was momentarily bummed out about not being young and single anymore.Here is his response: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ From: CHEO TO: COB Subject:  Sammy Sosa   I recently read your little conversation about MLB being racist. I cannot believe in any way, shape, or form that MLB is to blame for all the Sammy backlash. I also cannot believe that men making 15 to 20 mil a year have any right to complain. Especially the two spoiled brats in Boston. They get everything they want and still there not happy. What Sammy did was wrong, PERIOD! He admitted it and he apologized for it. Yes, the media has blasted him for what he did. He's Sammy Sosa. He's held to a higher standard. His fans have forgiven him and that's all that matters. Rick Reilly and Bill Madden are fools if they think his 505 home runs don't mean anything. But, they don't represent MLB. And as for Mark McGwire, the only reason he didn't get blasted was because Andro was legal in baseball at the time. Only the NBA, NFL, MLS and the NCAA had banned it. That makes it different. So, I think you and your boy EVIL there should calm down and not go overboard over all of this. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ I wonder what set him off? Actually he is right, we were being unclear. We (well  at least me, EVIL is crazy I dont know what he is thinking ever) don't think Bud Selig is racist or anything, I thinking more of the reporters and other members of "the institution of baseball".  Later, CHEO wrote me back and amended that  "All the Dominicans in Amboy are crying bloody murder and it's pissing me off."  HEH! Thats great.  I think WEB should provide us with the Dominican view at his earliest convienence.

Dude, blogger needs to add a polling applet or something because I got a question, who's pisses me off more?  Nets head coach, Byron Scott or Rory's boyfriend Jess on Gilmore Girls?

        Evil Weekend Commentary   I ran into the Puerto Rican Day Parade today. Literally. One minute I was jogging toward the park on 72nd street and the next minute I am rubbing my hip region into some girl's ample rump at 72nd and 5th. Everyone was so distracted (What there a Ben Affleck float?) that I managed to work my way down a row of asses without getting punched in the face. Deciding to quit while I still have all my teeth, I attempt to get past the parade and into the park to bang out 8 miles (pauses typing to flex). I try to shimmy in between the police barricades but this one cop catches hold if this and jumps out in front of me with both hands up and shouts "Exit only! Exit only!" in a frantic and defensive way. I was like, WTF? The dude acted like I was trying to get into his rectum and not the park. What a tool.  On a related note... I saw this one guy hanging with his buddies and his girl. His buddies all had on matching Fubu "Puerto Rico" jerseys. His girl had on something sexy and skin tight, with "Puerto Rico" across her boobies region. But this dude... guess what he was wearing... an Alexi Yashin jersey. What? What?  What?  That guy is self hating.  Lastly, and completely unrelated, I accidentally caught a bit of the Tony Awards on TV tonight and saw Christopher Reeve present an award. Christopher Reeve, if you're reading this... I have a heartfelt plea: Fucking stop making public appearances! You are freaking me out to no end.You will give me bad dreams, you are THAT freaky.

        SAMMY  Me and BEF had a conversation about Sammy Sosa today that pretty much sums up my feelings on the matter. Note how I draw BEF to my side by implying that caucasians are threatened by asian encroachment into baseball.  EVIL: conspiracy? Christian: huh? EVIL: "Last year, the first one standing up against me because he wanted a new face in baseball was [ESPN's] Peter Gammons," Martinez told the Courant. "[He was] standing up and saying, 'No, I'm going with Zito because we need a new face in baseball. We're tired of seeing the same Pedro on the team, the same face as Pedro all the time. We need a fresh face, a guy that plays guitar, is cute, a white Caucasian. We don't want the Latin [expletive] to be in front of the TV all the time.' EVIL: "They campaigned against me for the Cy Young. It's the same [expletive] they're doing with Sammy." Christian: i agree Christian: manny ramirez broke his media silence to address these issues with the media Christian: dude Christian: mcguire got caught with Andro Christian: and everyone still loved him Christian: f***heads EVIL: ha Christian: i think its very clearly racism Christian: baseball is very racist Christian: its the only thing white guys have left EVIL: right EVIL: The Man Christian: and the dominicans and the asians are taking it from them Christian: f*** them EVIL: a chick from DR won miss universe EVIL: yo Christian: she is legit HOT

       Woah, wierd flash back thing. So i fell asleep on my glasses (Item #5 on the "Signs that Chris is approaching rock bottom" list) and today they feel a little loose. I am hoping i will fall asleep on them again tonite in a different way to bend them back into shape...so sad....as it were...they were sliding down my nose a bit and I took my index finger, straightened it and deliberately shoved my glasses back towards my forehead. I remember when i was about 15, I was at this thing called Upward Bound all summer. Anyway, myself Channon Johnson and David Pierre had a good time making fun of this teacher (Mr. Watson??? Danny, Diane?? little help) for doing something very similar. Anyway that memory just plowed thru my head as I did. Sigh, I am slowly approaching what I used to mock....that Sign #4 on the list of "Signs that prove you are aging", again SIGH.

       OH RIGHT, I forgot: I think Lisa Marie Presley is really pretty. She is. It is odd that she looks like her dad, but I guess her dad makes for a cute chick. What can I say? Anyway, I don't really mind her songs either. But her performance last night during half time of the Nets-Spurs game was pretty unbearable. She has less personal charisma than Danny Barrera on Valium. She might well be a  charismatic black hole .

       First off, for Non basketball types, some at the NY Times wrote a hilarious review of Zootopia and Summer Jam X, those annoying clear channel sponsored concerts where they browbeat artists into performing for free in exchange for not pulling their songs from the playlist of a 1000 radio stations across the country. The end result is a bunch of unmotivated, no talents singing songs that I will be vaguely nostaglic for in about 10 year. Read that  urlLink here .   Dude, R Jefferson killed me. Deke did his part, WORD! But someone needs to box the f*ck out of D Robinson (who would have thought that would have mattered). J Kidd will show up money time on the next game. Also, I think K Mart should be taking it to Duncan down low more. Match up problems are two ways.

       How horrible was that loss to the Spurs? I am going to do what I do best and pass out the blame... I think we  have to pin this loss on Richard Jefferson, who pulled a Van Horn and completely disappeared. The only Net who distinguished himself (in a good way) was Mutumbo. Diving all over the place like a young man. I was looking for the finger wag. That would have been key. The finger wag. That's what the Nets need in Game 2. By the way, who was wearing #50 for the Spurs? Was that David Robinson, or a  young Bill Russell?  In unrelated news, some insect really bit me up in my sleep. I have bug bites all over. I also might have malaria, which is only fitting seeing as we've been getting rain forest-like weather lately.

I just got a message asking me if I was available to interview for the Toronto Raptors Head Coaching job.   Jersey BABAY JERSEY!!!  Have you all noticed I am only from Jersey when either the Nets or the Devils are in the finals or there is a new season of the sopranos...otherwise i say "I'm from NY".

       Late Start, just got out of a meeting sorry... My mom called me last nite just to make sure I was alive and then hung up on me!   Figure I would do a little Nets Spurs preview for kicks....  The Nets will win if  Kerry Kittles is a bigger factor than Stephen Jackson and/or R Jefferson outplays Manu Ginobli Rodney Rodgers drags Malik Rose outside to guard him (leaving the rebounding open for Kidd and K-Mart) the Nets have a fast break advantage of +10  The Spurs will win if Tim puts K-Mart in early foul trouble (and they have to dust off Deke) Spurs have a +5 advantage on rebounds (=No Nets fast break)  I got the series going the distance with the Nets pulling a minor upset.  K Mart,"The Bad Ass Yellow Boy" will have a huge series, Deke's elbow will be a major factor (10 minutes, 5 rebounds, 2 blocks and 6 fouls)    Double Parade in the PARKING LOT outside Continental Airlines Arena!! How obvious is it that I am from Jersey?

From: Mr. Shoulders  To: "'Ken", "BEF" CC: "Christian Barrera"  Subject: RE: Question about head size  Date: Mon, 2 Jun 2003 14:07:51 +0100    I wonder wht TJ's (J. Kidd's son) head size is going to be when he  grows up?  No news here to report - just working too hard.  -Mr. Shoulders   In other news, BEF and my brother, DAB might be joining the Barrera Blog team. No idea what that means yet, hopefully something good will happen but it will probably end badly.    I dont even want to touch last night's devils game. What a mess...

Typically the emails would start with a description of busy it is at work and end with a promise to do something interesting in London. I seem to be falling into the same pattern. How sad.

        Target Barrera   I spent this past weekend making a target of myself for pickpockets and other people that would try to take advantage of me. I spent saturday passed out under a tree in parque Ibirapura. That is pretty much how I spent most of my lost saturdays in Central Park when I lived in ny. Sunday I hit a street fair. I was primarily looking for a tour of the center of SP. Apparently, this tour had been cancelled some years ago and the Lonely Planet Guide failed to update (DAMN YOU LONELY PLANET!) So I walked around asking dumb questions and even managed to find to some ecuadorians playing those andien flutes. Have you ever noticed that ecuadorians are everywhere and they always have their flutes. While there I stumbled onto a Brazilian Hip Hop Festival which featured one group trying really hard to be Rage Against the Machine and another group trying really hard to be a tribe called quest. Anyway, apparently I fit in. Because at no point did any twelve year old try to stick me for my money

        Evil  I'm going to take a short break from the gay discussion today... not because I have anything against gay people mind you, I mean, some of my best friends are gay (we know who you are!)... I want to pitch an idea for a TV cartoon series in the off chance that television execs are reading on.  Get this (remember, it's a cartoon series)... the premise is that two puppies are adopted from the pound. The puppies are brothers from the same litter and they are adopted by two late-20's women. The women are friends who went to the pound together. The entire show is shown and told from the perspective of one of the puppies. He is the one who has been adopted by the less-confident, more-neurotic, chunkier-legged of the two women. Since the women are friends, our main puppy character gets to visit with his brother often, during which he likes gripes about how he got stuck with the "crazier" of the two owners. (Underlying theme for you academics: Puppies don't choose their owners just as we don't choose our parents.) The puppies will discuss the antics and histrionics of their owners -- single and urban, professional, with biological clocks ticking, cellulite accumulating, and innocence quickly fading.  For example, in one episode, our main puppy character recounts how his owner struggled with whether it's OK for her to have sex while the puppy looks on. (She nets out deciding that the puppy can watch if the man is decent looking and has potential for a serious relationship... but the puppy is scuttled out of the room when she brings home a slobbery, one-night, late-night hookup.)  That's the general idea. Hopefully, someone will pay me large sums of money to develop it further. Wooooo!

The Nets should replace their dance team with these dudes, that would be entertaining and Jersey-centric, plus i would pay good money to see the 'what tha fuck' look on KMart's face when they first came out.  I want to know outta curiousity, but by no means want to see a picture, but Xtian, did you ever go to clubbing down the shore near Amboy with a sleeveless shirt on back in the day?

        Evil   SNAPSHOTS FROM MY TRIP TO ROCK BOTTOM   One.  Fruit flies! You damn fruit flies! Where did you all come from? I don't remember inviting you to come over and hang out. There are hundreds of you! You know what, I wouldn't even mind it so much if you all just kept to yourselves and loiter around my garbage cans. But man, is it REALLY necessary for you to prance around my laptop screen when I'm trying to surf internet porn? C'mon man...   Two.  How did this package of ground beef find its way into my fridge? All I have in the fridge is a Brita filter, half a watermelon, half a bunch of scallions, and a package of ground beef. How random, but I'm not questioning it. I'm starving. I am thinking burger. No bread? No matter. Atkins style! (*Pats ground beef into patty shape. Pat, pat, pat. Salt: Sprinkle, sprinkle. Cracked pepper: Grind, grind.*) Tosses burger patty onto grill pan. Mmmmm. Longest 5 minutes of my life. (*Flips patty*) Damn, 5 more longest minutes of my life. (*Scoops patty off of grill pan... right onto the kitchen floor.*) ARRRRRGH! Screw it, I'm eating it anyway.   Three.  On the phone with The Korean Drew Barrymore:  KD: Hey, what've you been up to? Me: Oh nothing. Not working or anything. What about you? KD: Actually, I've been working for a couple of weeks now. Me: Oh. Congrats! KD: What kind of work are you looking for? Maybe I can help you... Me: I'm sure I'm beyond help at this point, but thanks.   Four.  On the phone with my mom:  My mom: It's getting hot again. Me: Yeah, it was hot today. My mom: Is it hot in your apartment? Me: Yeah, pretty hot. Sweating up a storm. My mom: Don't you have air conditioning? Me: Not right now. The air conditioner is stashed in your basement. We took it out in the winter, remember? My mom: Oh right. Me: Can you bring it back at some point? My mom: (Sighs heavily) You live on the 5th floor. The air conditioner is heavy. Me: Mom, you're not going to bring it back for me? My mom: No.

        Evil   You got some really serious issues man...you need some serious help.  You are a freaking pedophile...What is wrong with you?  Then again, the X-tian and his brother Bump are always talking about the Olsen twins so they are not far off from the pedophile tree themselves.   Stock Options  As of Sunday afternoon, I am officially working for "The Man."  Everyone at one point or another says that they are working for the Man or that the Man is oppressing them, that the man is keeping them down (Chuck) but I can safely say now that in my case is true.  Warren Buffett bought the real estate company I have been working for in Miami for an undisclosed sum of money.  We had this huge fancy breakfast at the Biltmore Hotel where the whole deal was announced.  Anyways, at one point I grab Warren and asked him about getting some stock options for Berkshire Hathaway.  I told him about the Class A stock ($72,000 a share) being a little out of my reach and if he could help a brother out...Anyways, he patted me on my shoulder and gave me a hearty laugh.  I am going to have to go buy one of his books as I don't know if now I am in his part of his new circle of friends or I am being blacklisted as we speak...   ManWhore  In other news, I have been kind of hanging out with this girl that mainly uses me as a boy-toy.  You know, she invites me to parties, buys me dinner and gets me drunk and such.  You know, kind of like a sugar-mommy.  Afterwards, she ravishes the Manolo temple over and over again.  This is something I do not mind at all.  Anyways, as a "favor" for her, I have "hung" out with a couple of her friends for some good old-fashioned clean fun.  Anyways, my question is: How does one find out if one is being pimped out for profit without insulting anybody?  If so, what is the appropiate cut I should be asking for?  Is there a ManWhore guide I should be reading?

       Huh indeed!     Public Transportation  As a rule, its pretty scummy for a man to sit in a seat on any public transportation if it is more than 3/4 full. Just stay standing you avoid any such confusion. Unless you are hung over or falling asleep then do what you want. I was hung over once and fell asleep on the shoulder of the 50 year old woman sitting next to me. For some reason she did not mind I think she might have liked it. My hair smells good sometimes, so I can see why.   The stuff that gets me is when people get all possesive about seats.  Total sidebar about public transportation, the only really scummy move I have ever seen on some public transportation is this. One saturday I was going to work (that's a giveaway it was 1999 or 2000) and it was early. I was standing there reading the paper or something and this crazy white lady gets on all frazzled and crazy and white. She sees this Latino dude with his little boy. The little boy is passed out and taking up two seats. The woman gets all worked up and entitled and jsut picks the kid up and tosses him on the dad. The guy is dumbfounded and says something to her in spanish. The lady just sits down and ignores him. THEN she friggin gets off 2 stops later. SHE CANT JUST STAND FOR 3.5 minutes? She's gotta put her hands on someone's kid? WHAT? I was so pissed off that when she was getting off she walked by me, I stuck my foot out and tripped her as she got off the subway, she stumbled around a bit while I laughed and pointed safely behind a closing subway door.

        Evil  My apologies for yesterday's post! It's true... I have a really bad gauge as to where "the line" is. It's like how some people can't tell they're talking WAY too loud or how other people have really bad gaydar. Even before Sleave's comment, I had been thinking about "the line." See, I was on the crosstown bus the other day... I was sitting down, the bus was somewhat crowded and a woman with a bulge in her belly came and stood in front of me. I glanced up at her real quick but I couldn't immediately tell whether she was pregnant or just a little chubby in the lower tummy area. You know how women tend to get that little paunch down there. Anyhoo... the girl next to me stands up and offers her seat to the woman, who I GUESS was pregnant. They both shot me a dirty look. It made me feel like a bad person.   But really... where is the line for giving up your seat to a pregnant woman? If you do it too early, the woman might not be actually pregnant and would thus be insulted, right? Someone give me a pointer here. I only want to be a decent human being.  So as not to end on such a morally ambiguous note, I'd just like to point out that an Indian man has  urlLink Elizabeth Hurley  wrapped around his little finger. Hmmm... let's see... Indian man + hot English woman. MR. SHOULDERS: you know what you have to do! Now go do it.

        Evil  At one point in your life, you've either listened to Love Line or watched the show on MTV, right? You know, Love Line is the show with Dr. Drew and Adam Corolla. I used to listen to the radio show when I lived in the Bay Area, mostly while in my car, driving home from work late at night. Ah, those were the heady days of startup fever. But anyway... I always wondered about the 14 and 15 year old girls who would call in and ask questions about BJ and pregnancy tests and morning-after pills and all that crazy jazz. Who were these girls? And why didn’t they go to MY high school? I always wondered what they looked like and if I could spot them in a crowd. OK, hey, sure... that MAY BE a little perverted but listen, I was driving home from work late at completely crappy hours and living in Silicon Valley where sausages outnumber coochie by like, a million to one... at least. What do you want from me? But back to the topic... so yeah, what did these girls look like?  Now I know!  Has anyone seen American Juniors... particularly the chick contestants? DUDE, those chicks are dirty 14 year olds. I am almost positive that they have better BJ technique than a lot of stuck-up Ivy League girls who you might or might not know.  I've decided to stop watching American Juniors, not because I suddenly turned gay, but because in my heart, I know that watching the show is a ding on my Heaven Application.  Just for the record: I think  urlLink Lucy Hale  is my favorite.

        Evil  I made a startling discovery this weekend. No, you nerds, I didn't discover the squark. (Please! My work in supersymmetry and string theory is top secret. Put a lid on it!) What I discovered was:  Even in Manhattan, it's pretty hard to get food delivery before noon on a Sunday. WHO KNEW? I used to think that only outer-borough losers had to deal with things like this, but there I was, 11am on a Sunday and really jonesin' for some food. Any food, really. As long as it was hot. My refrigerator was completely empty except for some milk that I'm sure had gone bad, several bottles of Gatorade, and a Brita filter. I sat around from 11am til noon, munching on a handful of pine nuts that I found in the cupboard and at exactly 12 noon, I phoned in an order for an 18" pizza with sausage and peppers. Mmmmm. I ate that thing in 2 sittings and didn’t even feel it. When did I become such a slobbery mess? When did I stop loving myself?  Speaking of which, has anyone noticed all the recent bad news about fat people? There was some study that came out about how fat children are these days, as compared with previous generations. Then I saw  urlLink this article  about a 15-year old Sumo wrestler who died from heart disease.  Oh! Speaking of "the Japanese" (use of quotes to imply some sort of racism?)... KEN: are you up in arms about that Banzai show on Fox? Dude, I'm not even Japanese and I was offended on your behalf. That show is out of control.  I am making all sorts of associations today... Speaking of strange TV shows, I recently noticed that there is a cartoon called  urlLink Angry Beavers  on Nickelodeon. Angry Beavers? Tell me about it...

        Pleasant Surprise: The Return of Lex Luthor   A couple of years ago, I was pretty hung over one day at work and spent 3 hours writing something about the purple suit shirt I was wearing and how much I liked the color purple and how people thought I was kind of a freak for not being that guy with the Blue (hey its the new white) Suit shirt was really popular at the time.  I still have the story somewhere, and may put online for goofs when I get situated again. Anywho, that was then, Today, I woke up and looked through my closet which the cleaning lady was kind enough to organize for me and what did I discover, but a NEW Purple shirt that I had totally forgotten I owned. I bought it on sale at Express men shortly before I got to Brazil. Anyway, I am so pumped. I think purple will be back as my color. I might even shave my head before school starts and push the Lex motif to the fullest.   Also, I am going to start throttling people that say "Hey ---, its the new ---". That's been irksome for like 4 years already.

        Evil  Even though I've lived in New York for most of my life, I seldom witness anything out of the ordinary. For example, I've never seen a celebrity. And I'm not talking about Madonna or DeNiro... I haven't so much as been in the same bagel shop as Regis Philbin. Two summers ago, I ran the Central Park reservoir anywhere from 3 to 5 times a week, usually in the middle of the day. I figure the odds were against me NOT running into Howard Stern, but hey, it didn't happen.  It's sunny today, so I was at the Great Lawn, tanning, and generally minding my own business when two chicks, who were about 20 feet to my immediate left, dropped their bikini tops. WHAT? Is today Nudist Pride Day or something? Am I being disrespectful by wearing shorts? Let me tell you... these two chicks were smokin'. The blonde girl had breasts like right out of an x-rated Anime film. If she had a nickname, it would be The Girl With The Perkist Tits in Manhattan. The other girl was a redhead (no "firecrotch" comments from the gallery, please) and had great nipples in her own right. They started rubbing lotion on their boobs and it was at this point that I had to turn over and lie on my stomach, if only out of respect for the little kids who were also sharing the Great Lawn.

        Evil  There's  urlLink a site  that takes long-ass URLs and gives you back a short URL for easier use. I think that's pretty cool. For example:   http://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/14/ international/worldspecial/14CND-IRAQ.html?hp   becomes:  urlLink  http://tinyurl.com/gxha    HOW DOES THAT WORK? Since I know there are at least three computer science majors out there, I thought this might be an interesting thing to think about. According to the site, the short redirection links never expire, so they are not recycled. To be honest, I don't really expect Big Head or Mr. Shoulders to come up with an explaination, but Ken is Japanese, so Ken... don't disappoint!  (Unrelated...) By the way, X-TIAN: that girl's official nickname is "No Incidental Contact Girl." Missing the "No" part makes a big difference. It's like the time that I had knee problems and told my Crazy White Friend that the doctor had prescribed "inflammatories" (as opposed to anti-inflammatories). Needless to say, she laughed at me for being a clown.  (Unrelated still...) Lastly, here is picture #2 from the "Bad Parenting Photos" series.

       I am still confused about Manolo and Ken hanging out together driving around in a Camry with underbelly neon. Who wore the pattern black mess shirt tight sh*t?  Did the Incidental Contact Girl get married? Is that why you guys were in Portland? Damn, Mr. Shoulders still has not gotten within 10 ft of her.

       Two posts for the price of one...   Smells like sex and candy   About a month ago, I started to write my first post on the site but my computer crashed.  Being the lazy bastard that I am, I took it as a sign and went to watch TV or something.  Besides, I was still upset that Manolo and Scarface were both taken as user names.  How am I supposed to represent the Dirty South if I don't have the appropiate user name? How can I? YOU TELL ME....  As many of you know, if you are not in NYC, you need a car to get anywhere.  That meant I had to put some money down for some wheels.  I went to the store to look at some Escalades and Beamers but alas, I am not rolling in the dough like Evil who is selling enterprise software left and right.  I had to settle for a 1998 Ford Explorer which is doing an okay job of taking me around. (By the way, I don't want to hear from anybody how I am supporting terrorists because I spend $45 a week on gas...if you are going to blame somebody, blame Detroit for holding back the engine that runs on water.)  Anyways, being this my first car ever, I am having all sorts of first-time experiences which I am truly cherishing.  You know, checking the transmission fluid, changing the oil, rotating the tires, risking rollovers by turning too quickly, having sex in the back of the car, etc.  Did you know that the funk from such an adventure, even after thoroughly cleansing the car over and over again, lasts for almost 2 weeks? That is a crazy amount of time...   Notes from Portland  In other news, I spent July 4th weekend up in Portland, Oregon for my friend's wedding.  Did you know who was there?  None other than the Japanese wunderkid (1/4 of Team Rachel) exhibiting a Lobster red tan from his stay in San Diego.  The fact that he is not a Hertz express member meant I and the rest of the party had to hold his golf clubs and wait like an hour for him to get this very stylish 2Fast 2 Furious Camry LE with Neon lights in the bottom.  After that brief delay, we were styling and ready to take the city by storm.  On our way to the hotel, we decided to grab some food which mainly ended up consisting of 8 pints of beer from this local microbrewery.  After this, we checked into the hotel where we promptly proceeded to see what porn movies were available.  We debated the merits of Asian Gonzo and Throbbing Threesomes, and failing to reach an agreement, we went on to watch one of the Williams sister in her semifinal match.  Not being overly excited by tennis, I fell asleep and woke up a couple of hours later (with my shirt untucked and pants unbuckled ???) finally ready to take the city by storm (it actually reminded me of the little TV break Xtian, Little Big Head and I took about a year ago before we wrecked havoc in Miami and got chased off by the Russian Mafia).  Anyways, our main activities consisted of eating food and having informal symposiums which involved jugs of cheap Chilean wine (Gato Negro)  bought at Rite Aid.  We debated again such topics as the hotel's selection of porn and Xtian's all-encompassing Metrosexuality.  We also debated how Japanboy should have responded to the hippie that yelled at him for unknowingly trying to crash a Blues Festival whose entry fee consisted of $5 and 2 cans of food.  By the way, on this trip I found out that JapanBoy is a closet  Metrosexual  himself.  He had enough fancy gels and moisturizers in that bag of his to mummify David Beckham himself...Metrosexuals of the world unite...

        LXG   The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is getting killed in the  urlLink reviews.  Did anyone realize that Elvis Mitchell reads comic books. He made an allusion to issue 2 of League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (vol 2), the scene where Mr. Hyde rapes and kills the Invisible Man which I thought was pretty grim. Obviously, stuff like that can't be in the movie. Grow up Elvis, this is meant to be for kids. Roger Ebert in his review pointed out that there are no streets in Venice, which is true and will now prevent me from enjoying the movie. Thanks.   I like James Robinson, he wrote my favorite comic of the late 90's, Starman for DC Comics. I like Steven Norrington, he did Blade, an underrated movie. I like placing blame. Its what I do best. So I am going to blame Don Murphy and the ego of Sean Connery for this travesty of a movie.    Addendum   NY Times continues to dump on LXG and they give the Comic Book props while doing so.

       Here is what I was going to write today.   "Is everyone else as blown away as I am by the revelation that Britney and Justin had sex? Not that I don't think that Britney is a dirty girl, but I always thought Justin was gay. I think I took a straw poll with my family and we had it going 8 to 1. The only decenting vote being my brother, the Bumpasaurus, Pacey Witter. Read into that what you will. Who is taking bets that the next revelation in "W" Magazine will be something about X-tina and the Ringling Bros. Circus?  BTW, i am going to shoot myself. Apparently, Ashton Krutcher is being considered for the role of Clark Kent. God, I'm sick of that guy. Dude, trucker hats are over..."   Whlie on the subject I'd like to point out that the first nude scene i ever saw in a movie was Demi Moore in "About Last Night"...i was like 9. Bump was there too...he was like 4.   But I digress, I think "The Hose" is getting a little too vicious. Don't you? I don't know Britney, Justin or Ashton. They seem like nice people that I just dislike irrationally because they are more famous than me. That's just wrong. I am going to work on doing better. I am going to avoid making generalizations and not considering other sides of the story when shooting my mouth off. While on the subject. i would like to say that EVIL was out of line yesterday making fun of the gross little fat boy. It's not his fault he looks like that. I blame the parents. They should be strung up and beaten for being bad parents and bad people.

       I am pretty glad that  Charlies Angels: Full Throttle  is not as big as the studios had hoped.  At a 120MM (USD) price tag  i think it needed to generate a lot more money than it has to this point to merit a third, increasingly annoying sequal.  I imagine that price excludes marketing, which had to be expensive for this friggin movie. I mean jeez is there anywhere aside from my toilet bowl that I have not seen Drew Barrymore telling me about girl power, and being friends with Lucy Lui, and about how great Demi Moore looks and giggling incesantly, (shut up! shut up! shut up!)  ugh...  Too bad about  The Hulk , though, I thought it was a noble, if somewhat flawed effort.  Hey Avi Arad, Here is some free advice. Focus on making a good spiderman sequal as opposed to rushing what will probably be a bad Punisher film to the big screen.   Right now, I am at work...not wearing pants.

        Dumb American Move of the...um...day? week? Month?  So my breakfast scenario is pretty straight forward. I show up to work and go find a  pao de quiejo  and a cappuchino (cheese bread and cappuchino for y'all not in the know). I will digress for a moment and share that breakfast is called " cafe da manha " or morning coffee, which is odd because in spanish you can get away with a colloquiel " cafe " but people call it " desayuno " which literary translates to " break fast ", which seems a little classier if you ask me. I am not sure why. Anywho, love me the pao de quiejo because it makes me think fo pan de yuca (yuca bread? Who knows how to say yuca in english...) which my moms and grandmoms are all about make...But I digress (yet again). Anywho, yesterday afternoon when I went out for my late afternoon coffee (not to be confused with my breakfast coffee, or my mid mornning coffee or my afterlunch coffee) and i saw someone eating what i would call, a "butter roll, hot" if I were in a deli somewhere on the upper east side! So I resolve to have one for breakfast the next day, because these are the types of things I have to plan out way in advance. What's the word for butter? " mantieja " What's the word for hot? " Quenta " Got it good.  So this morning i find the vendor  Me: Oui Her: bom dia, todo bem ? Me: uhhh...sim..um...todo bem Her:... me:... me: ummm.....um cappuchino com um pao com mantieja Her:... Pao de Quiejo me: no (i should say  nao , because  no  actually means  of  in portuguese or something and the  nasally no  or  nao , means the negative, and at this point I am almost crying, and she is looking at me wierd), esse Her: Esta me: no (see above...on the verge of tears) Her: ah, pao frances? Me: sim... ISSO what? oh it is french bread, I couldn't say pao frances?  what am i stupid? I'm stupid! I am now beating myself about the head in anger.  Her: Quenta? Me (thumbs up...i'm thru talking...everybody's getting thumbs for the rest of the day)  Ugh, all that for a freaking coffee.  There are far too many possible permutations for a conversation , you can't even properly prepare to order a friggin cup of coffee, someone asks you if you want creme, you say yeah sure and they friggin put cool whip on it like a bunch of MOMOs. Stop the madness!  Its too much to bear. This is how much thought I have to put into anything. I am going batty. I wish people spoke english or at least spanish like the rest of friggin LA, who are these maniacs. Here's another quick example. Someone accused me of speaking Portu-nol, I corrected him and said it was more like Espan-uese. It was worth a good laugh. Then what? Beats me! I can barely friggin communicate. We started at each other in awkward silence.

        sleeve vs Samuel Valez   i've been kicked in the ass by Sinusitis. Which i imagine is what it feels like to take a bare-fisted punch from Iron Mike to the temple. Both undoubtedly leave you with a headache going on 5 days nows. But while all i can bitch about are infected mucous membranes, Sam Valez gets to live off the glory of being dropped by Tyson with one punch, in front of his fiancee and friend. Much better story.

Someone may need to transfer that into Kilos for the folks in Latin America. While on the subject I also downed 2-3 passion fruit Caipirinhas (shut up! shut up! shut up!)

        Evil            Ralphie May  (above), from "Last Comic Standing." Estimated weight: 550 pounds   Ruben Studdard  (right), from "American Idol." Estimated weight: 350 pounds             I had a pretty big plate of pasta for dinner last night and being that it was a warm summer evening and also because I had an 18-pound watermelon chilling in the fridge, I could hardly help but be pretty jazzed about it all. (+5 on the FA Index!) I sliced up half the watermelon and brought it to my bed --in TWO plates-- to eat because at this point in my life, I can't be bothered to eat sitting up. One plate in and I knew I was in trouble but I resolved to be tough and finished off the second plate anyway. And besides, I didn't want to walk back to the fridge. It's much easier to drop plates at the foot of one's bed and fall asleep with the lights on, all the while wondering why watermelon tastes so good but has to hurt so bad.  I'm not sure if being overly stuffed had anything to do with this, but I had a really bad dream. I was in my old high school building and rushing around trying to find room 189 for biology class, but for the life of me, I couldn't find it and it was pissing me off. At the peak of my frustration, I run right into both Ruben Studdard and Ralphie May in the hallway and without any explanation at all, they turn around and put their asses in my direction and made an ass sandwich with me in the middle. At one point, Ruben was shouting "Back that truck up!!!" as he leaned in with all his weight.  Luckily, I managed to wake up before dying.

       blade 2 was better then blade 1 ..maybe not story-wise but definetly better characters effects, acting.... (1)Spiderman(clearly the standard for all movies, the hulk tried a similar approach in not making it as serious as the x-men movies but it didnt work nearly as well) (2)Unbreakable(the best movie of all but not based on a comic book) (3) X2 (4)Batman (5)Xmen (6)Insert your choice of superman movie hear..i would go with the one with richard prior ..might be 3 i dont remember (7) blade 2 (8)batman 2(catwoman)   (9)blade (10 - tie )hulk        punisher(ninja's, dolph lundren, massive body count..better then the last 8 batman sequels ...i dont remember any other comic movies..hopefully i can replace this with a better punsher movie coming out in 2004) road to perdition was a terrible movie...my brother knows this but he refuses to tell anyone ...i heard it from his own mouth he woke me up at the end of the movie and said "..boy did that suck"...some chick probably asian must've said she liked it and he went ahead and decided he liked it as well and replaced boring with beautiful in his new synopsis of it...  the hulk's first 25 mins were unbearable.....they had to give soem background but the way the went about it was horrible...i actually yelled out in the theater "this is terrbile"..esp the first couple of scenes between bruce and betty...she ofcourse was amazing throughout..he (eric bana) played the "toole banner" too well...it was horrible to watch..it didnt pick up till he changed into the hulk..the fight with the dogs was cool..the absorbing man's use of his power to become a being of electricity was pretty sweet..but when he first discovers he has powers doesnt he put it together way to fast..i know he's supposed to be super smart but his hand gets stuck in a table and 3 secs later he exclaims " i have to the power to absorb the esscence of all the inaminate object i coem into contact with"... what...too hokey..the cinematography was too herky jerky and the beigning overall it was good....the ending killed me thouhg...that was lame..sequel needs to be better

        NO DADDY NO!   I went to watch  The Hulk  on sunday and have some thoughts. My first, as I walked out of the theater, is what would have happened if the 4 year old Bruce had tried to do anything during that scene with his parents? Would he still be carrying around the repressed guilt and rage? Dunno... ANYWAY, on to other thoughts. Overall, I must say I liked it.  Ang Lee  did an interesting job filming what was a tough movie to make and the CGI Hulk that ILM put together was sufficiently realistic in his movements and his facial expressions. Although, like with all CGI animation I get creeped looking at their eyes. They look kind of empty don't they? Also, they don't always seem to be looking at the right place. CREE-PEE.  Anywho, there were some awesome touches, like the split panel scenes, that was designed to resemble a comic book, the gamma irridated poodle also rock quite hard, as did Nick Nolte and his overe the top,  BAD DAD , David Banner.  The casting of VICTIM MOMMY BANNER was also interesting because she looked a lot like Jennifer Connoley, and kind of threw a whole creepy mother love, greek tragedy thing into the mix for me. I'm not sure that was intentional or not. Also, how awesome in Jennifer Connoley. I can stare at her for hours.   There was also bad.  Firstly and most importantly, the first 30 minutes or so moved about as smoothly as me trying to drive stick shift. That is to say, not at all. The first 30 minutes blew. It was kind of like Ang just said, "let's just pump through the background and into the  hulk smask  as quickly as possible". I had a hard time guaging the Hulk's weight. When he was doing his Hulk Jumps, I kept expecting more ground to break under him. At times it looked like he did not have any weight. That bugged. Also, at one point BAD DADDY Banner reveals himself to be some sort of anarchist type, except that came out like 2 hours into the movie and did not seem terribly consistent with everything else he said. Also, why were they allowed in a room together? Who thought that the Army would let that happen...no way...  I would have handled it differently. To address pacing, I would have opened the movie with both Banners in capitvity. The opening line would have been a therapist saying something like "Tell me about your father" and we could pan to reveal Bruce all captured Hannibal Lecter style and telling his story. The story would the be intercut with Bad Daddy, delivering an oral manifesto to his therapist talking about whatever and what not. Each telling the story from their own perspective. We would have all been spared the clunkiness of the openning scenes and one or two awkward lines that made me flinch. All the events could have gone down the same way, but told in flash back and glossing over some stuff. At the end of session, BAD DADDY would reveal himself and then go after his son. The last 20 minutes of the movie stay exactly the same. What would this do (1) hopefully improve pacing, especially early on (2) set up Bad Daddy's motivation minute one, as opposed to retro-fitting (3) kind of give you a bit of tension that certain parts of the movie lack (4) Set up a sequal, because all familiar with the Hulk mythology know, that the split personality stuff is what makes banner and the hulk separate. The sequal would then be about the merger of the personalities or the emergence of the third personality. As it is, in the movie, this whole idea is touched on only once, when Banner looks int eh mirror and the hulk looks back and tries to choke him.   Anyway, I liked it. Flawed but good. Ang Lee rocks.   Best Comic Book Movies EVER!!  While thinking about the Hulk I started wondering where it fit in relation to other movies in the genre. Here is a list I came up with. Anyone got a better one?  (1) Spiderman - Just perfectly executed. A movie for everyone. Four year old Isaiah Abreu's favorite flick! Occasional wack CGI be damned. (2) Road To Perdition - I probably should not rate this this highly, just because i never read the comic. But still, it was really pretty and the photographer scenes really added a cool "splash panel" comic book effect. (3) X2 - Best open 35 minutes of any movie on this list. Period. On point characterization, and no need for too much exposition (4) Unbreakable - Not based on a comic book per se, so it gets dinged down to the 4 spot as a result. Pacing issues aside, its an awesome homage to the genre (5) Superman 2- Not a great film, but perfectly executed and true to the mythology. The only time,  there was a credible threat to Superman, which is always cool. (6) Batman -  Tim Burton brought the Dark Knight to Life in a way no one thought possible. The fore father to the modern comic book movie.  (7) Blade - Disco blood sprinklers, nuff said.   (8) X-men -  "We're the future Charles, not them."  Best Line reading ever! Of course, the worst line reading ever is also in this movie, thanks Halle... (9) Hulk- Yah! Hulk makes the list, I could stare and Jennifer Connely for ever.  (10) From Hell - Very cool, flick set in Victorian England. Try your best to ignore the crappy accents.  Anyone got a better List? Let's  urlLink hear  it.    LXG  Message to the crew at Fox, The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen would be LEG not LXG. Do X's really equal ticket sales? is this porn? If you need a compressed title, i would have suggested,  "League..."

        Evil     Let's do a little mental exercise, shall we? C'mon, it'll be fun!  The picture above is that of a baby walker. I trust you've all seen one of these contraptions in action at one point or another (despite the meagerness of your lives). Now try to imagine a similar jig... not for babies, but for dogs! Doggie slips into a little harness supported by a lightweight aluminum frame. The whole thing is on wheels and doggy scoots along the ground with the effective body weight of a mutt on the moon. Can you see it?  Well get this. I saw a woman walking her dog in such a contraption today! (I wish I had my camera with me, but I didn't.) The little dog was scooting along free and easy. Barely an effort.  When I caught hold of this, I did what came most naturally to me. Now, those of you who know me probably know that sometimes I say out loud thoughts that are in my head. You might also know that sometimes I have no idea how loud I'm talking, despite the fact that I'm talking really damn loud. As this woman and her pooch cross in front of me, I go: "DAMN WOMAN, YOUR DOG NEEDS TO TOUGHEN UP!"  She shot a nasty glare in my direction, as if to say, "Go put on a rice hat and build me a railroad, Chinaman." Okay, maybe I was overly-defensive there. But in any event, there I was... standing next to a woman whom I had clearly just insulted. I weighed my options:  1. Pretend I never said anything in the first place and give the woman a bewildered look. Bank on the fact that her being a white, older woman from the upper east side also makes her cuh-ray-zee. See if she will crumble under her own self doubt.  2. Think of a witty follow-up line to diffuse the tension. The downside of this option is that I have to think of a witty follow-up line.  3. Run away.  In that moment of truth, I went with Option 3. I think my mom, my friends, my minister, every teacher I've had from Kindergarten thru 12th grade, and my parole officer would all be proud of me.

        Evil  The bugs are eating me alive. I swear. The past two nights I've hardly slept because when I'm not furiously scratching my feet, legs, arms, neck, and other places, I am lying still, feeling little insect nibbles on my skin.  This morning, I woke up with a tube of toothpaste beside my pillow. My feet and ankles were smeared with a flouridey-fresh tartar control formula. (Yay!) But why? In fact, I noticed that my legs, both elbows, parts of my forearm, my stomach, upper left thigh, and neck all sported clumsily applied circles of toothpaste. Apparently, my semi-conscious self wandered to the bathroom during the night to find a cure for these crazy bug bites.  Is my bed really THAT dirty? I never eat on it or anything. What can it be? Is my blood just that much better tasting than my neighbors' blood? There is a girl who lives one floor below me and she's quite the chubster. Hey bugs, if you're reading this... GO SUCK ON HER! Leave me alone. Please.

        Evil  Weird dreams last night.   In the first one, I heard the chattering of several teenage girls outside my bedroom window. I lifted the shade and peered outside. It was five or six teenage girls, all black, gathered on the fire escape for a quick smoke and a chat. They didn't see me. In the dream, I wondered to myself why I had never before noticed that huge fire escape.    In the second dream, I was still in my bedroom, still in bed. I heard the rickety door to the fire escape swing open. I lifted the shade and peered outside. It was a single teenage girl, still black, but in a light-skinned sort of way. The fire escape is no longer huge, but it's now much closer to my window. In fact, it's right at my window. I see the girl. She see me. She is embarrassed, stomps out her cigarette, and goes back inside.   I live on the 5th floor. The living room window of my apartment faces a small office building. One of the offices has sheets of shatterproof plastic installed on the outside of their windows. I noticed late last night that when the lights are out in the office, when it's dark outside, when it's dark inside my apartment, I have a clear and illuminated view of the apartment directly beneath me, reflected from the sheets of shatterproof plastic. That is, when the girl who lives in there has her halogen lamp on, as she did last night.  She is blonde. Last night, she wore a tight beige top that wrapped her tight body. I didn't see anyone else in her apartment but I'm not sure if she lives alone. When she went to the bathroom, she closed the door behind her. She watches TV with a severe forward lean. I wonder what drew her attention so. She sews. I watched as she pulled thread through cloth with slender outstretched arms. Who sews these days? Apparently, she does.

What about Vinny? Who knows....he looked done last year but reports say he is in awesome condition. It might be over.             On Saturday, I checked out the Sprite Liquid Mix Tour in Concord, CA. Boy was it hot!. The bill was Talib Kweli, The Roots, O.A.R. and the headliners N.E.R.D.  I know its strange, how does N.E.R.D. headline over The Roots and what are the alt-southern frat rockers O.A.R even doing on that bill.   Not sure, all i know is that Pharrell is the Biggest Popstar out...and little girls were screaming their heads off singing along to "Brain" a rap about bj. Very interesting and a great show.

        Evil  Actually, thirteen year old girls have the advantage when it comes to writing screenplays. They just crank out something that might or might not be junk but every 27 year old with a Joey Tribbiani haircut is running out to see it under the assumption that the movie is about a thirteen year old girl who falls in with the wrong crowd and subsequently gets her vag poked (repeatedly). Oh, that IS what this movie is about?

        Thirteen     In case you have not noticed I have been speeding to catch up ever since I got back from Brazil. I was kind of so busy down there I have not had a chance to sync up with simple stuff (say the California Recall etc or the new fall season of TV or the movies!)  I have been meaning to watch "Swimming Pool" but have not gotten around to it yet. However i think before I watch that I will watch  urlLink thirteen  from Fox Searchlight.   Apparently its about some thirteen year old girls freaking off, which would normally be enough for me to sign up but when you add in the advertisements I have been seeing in the Times and the NY Times Magazine  urlLink Article   I read today with Nikki Reed (the cowriter and co-star) it seems like a legitimate film.  Btw,  Evil  and I should be embarrased. Some thirteen year old girl cranked out a movie script and he and I are tooling around trying to find character motivations for some of the characters in our opus,  At the Seems .

        Good to be Home  For those of you who don't know, I have been laying low in O-Town for the last few days because its nice and hot and muggy down here and I needed to compress my entire summer into one week (its technically winter in Brazil where I was all summer so really I missed out on summer. Does that sentence make sense?)  Yesterday, for kicks, my mom threw in some home video from the mid eighties, in between making fun of my mom's hair style I slid in that I resembled something not unlike an ewok (just so no one would be mad at me for making fun of their hair). Of course, then my mother blew across the screen in something that might best be described as a silver jumpsuit and a rather intense perm. My brother commented that she also belonged some where far far away, battling the empire.   Before anyone got popped in the face for having a smart lip I went off to the outlet stores and did some shopping.  Purchases included  Assorted work out gear  Red Fitted short sleeved shirt Linen Pants 2 containers of Body Wash  My mother looking over the spoils of my shopping victory quickly asked where the blue ascot was.  Good times....   How Old Are these People    urlLink Watch With Kristen  today told me that the ratings for  The O.C.  though strong, were probably not where they should be.  Which bummed me out because I think its a great show staring the guy with the scary eye brows, the guy who played Dave Rygaski (the asian fetishist, christian guitar rocker on  Gilmore Girls ) and assorted actors who look to old to be in high school. Check these people out.             Lets be serious are these actors who play Ryan and Marissa, respectively, really supposed to be in High School. Now before you all hit the IMDB and tell me that Mischa Baron's  urlLink entry  says she was born in 1986, let me just say, I know and I checked. But one should also note that she was born in England, which would probably make her British and everyone knows that Brits age quicker than most (Nigella Lawson aside). Anyway, I no longer remember my point except these people don't look like high schoolers, still the show rocks hard.   In addition to  the O.C.  I will be adding either  Jake 2.0  or  Tru Calling  ( I haven't seen either yet, but one or both will be worth watching) as shows i will actually try to watch (as opposed to shows I just say I watch, I'm looking at you  West Wing  and you too  Six Feet Under ) in addition to my old standbys of  Angel ,  Gilmore Girls  and  Alias .

        How to black out during a blackout   urlLink   &nbsp;&nbsp; urlLink    So I'm killing time at work. I was adding a poll and hilighting certain genres of games on bottom of the  urlLink Baseball's Best  section of the MLB site when the power shut down the 10 laptops and 8 TVs that were in the room with me.  Over the next hour, i mingled with the work folk in the lunchroom, and attempted an enthusiastic applause when the Editor in Chief informed us that the site was still functioning. It was the last thing on my mind. I was thinking about the fact that the sun was gonna go down in 3 more hours and i only lived a 45 minute walk away.  When they opened up the vending machine and gave away Aquafina waters, i grab one and headed for the exit and proceeded to walk across 14th street from 9th Avenue to Avenue C. Past a lot of peeps that were about to walk farther than me, saw 2 ice cream stores giving away their goods, and random men and women directing traffic in the intersections to keep traffic going.  I go home and immediately stand in a line at the local bodega, they only were letting 4 or 5 people in at a time because it was dark. I ending buying a 12 pack of PBRs for $7 and ignore the fact that everyone else is concerned about ice, batteries and flashlights. I quickly place the PBRs in the freezer and start drinking at the local German beer garden across the street, Zum Schneider. Since i happened to have $42 cash on me before the ATMs turned off, I was in the upper middle-class of the new energyless society.  After much drinking, around 10:30pm I found a BBQ of a new restaurant that had just opened and had set up a Weber grill on the sidewalk and was selling their lamb, steaks, prawns and chicken kabobs off the street for $3. good ass BBQ...  I'm gonna summarize the rest of the night, cause it get blended into one moment.. The picture above are from Tompkins Square Park in Manhattan. A bonfire that lasted from around 9pm until 5am... the smoldering remains of burnt trashcans and other flammables were extinguished around noon the following day, even though the police surrounded the park all night, they allowed the fires and drinking on the street and in the park. Gotta give them props on choosing the right battles that night.  Back home, my roommate gave me chocolate covered hallucinegentic mushrooms, and started to peak trip around 3am, while skateboarding (which i had done 5 other times in my life) from Avenue C to Washington Square Park, in hope of meeting some mad hippy NYU biotches. I get there to find one dude with a battery powered amp singing cover songs in the middle of the fountain with way too much soul and vocal inflection for me to enjoy it. He played very personalized renditions of the Eagles (Hotel California), Radiohead, and then Led Zepplin (Stairway) before i decided to skateboard down a newly paved St. Marks home.  the rest of the night is a blur on my roof, where i intended to sleep on an air matress to beat the heat, but mother fuckers rocked out past 5:30am, so i past out downstairs in my room just before sunrise. fun night. i'll try to fill in more details as recalled. only regret is i didn't find the NYU hippy biotches.

        Evil    Whoa! X-TIAN got his eyebrows waxed?! I'm as progressive as the next dude but hey, I gotta ask... at what point does metrosexuality cross over into full on gayness?  Getting one's eyebrows waxed?  Spending the afternoon at a male beauty parlor? (More on this later.)  Lifting weights with your buddy and then saying something about your girlfriend complaining that you have a flat ass and your buddy goes, no way, you so don't have a flat ass and just to prove it your buddy bets that he can't stick his cock in your ass and before you know it your mom is at the door asking if everything is ok in there because she heard all the grunting. Is THAT gay?  In any event, props go out to X-TIAN because I think he may well be The Original Metrosexual. Way before the NYT article. Back in 1999, X-TIAN came up to me one day at work and suggested that we go get our nails done at  urlLink John Allan's . WHAT? John Allan's also offers a "full service" package that includes shampoo & conditioning, hot face towel, haircut, manicure, and a shoeshine. They'll even bring you a pint of beer or cocktail while you're being serviced. The only disappointing part is that "full service" doesn't include a BJ, but maybe metrosexuals aren't into that kind of stuff? Someone please verify...  Lastly, I have appointed myself to the post of X-TIAN's manager. In exchange for managing his business career and negotiating his contracts, I get a 10% cut. Additionally, I am currently negotiating with John Allan's to sponsor the Metrosexual Move of the Week feature.  ( Bonus: Here's a  urlLink classic comedy bit  to brighten your day, scumbag. )

        Evil  PARTY LIKE IT'S 1999 (B.C.)    urlLink       urlLink       urlLink       I've heard it suggested that once you go black, you never go back. Personally speaking, I'll take electricity any day. The city went black for all of 16 hours, which in the grand scheme of things doesn't seem like such a big deal but let me tell you, I went batty by minute five.  Luckily, it turns out that my downstairs neighbors are incredibly proactive people. They dropped by to ask me if I had any perishables in the fridge. I said no, but I did offer them some sausage and salty nuts. They declined, but invited me down to the front of the apartment for the Blackout BBQ.  The girls went to buy charcoal while all the dudes in the building made a fast break for the nearest Indian convenience store with a liquor case. It's obvious everyone had the same thing on their minds: Someone is going to get "blackout lucky."  People brought down their perishables and folding chairs and sat and drank beer while a girl whose pants kept threatening to fall down tended to the fire. The grill was set up on the garbage can cubby and the folding chairs mingled among the day's uncollected garbage. The rats, whose turf we had overtaken for the night, retreated for fear of getting BBQ'd. This was a classy operation.  We had to drink fast because nothing was going to keep the beer cool for long. The girls waved to passers-by and shouted, Happy Blackout! At some point, I think propositioned the blonde, but I think I did so in a very sloppy way. It was classy. Very classy.

        Waiting   While we wait for one of the 3 NY based contributors to check in with a report from  The City that Electricity Forgot  (anyone?) I figured I would hold down the fort.  I arrived at my home in the Oakland Hills (tentativily titled  "The Who Knew 2"  House , The Real Gay World House? i dunno you decide) on sunday evening to find no one there. None of my 3 roommates were there and I had to break into the house. I ran around the outside till I found an open door and entered. At this point I realized that I was a 6'2'' Latino breaking into a 1.5 MM dollar home in the Oakland Hills looking incredibly hairy and very suspicious. Also, I was not sure this was actually the right house as I had been working on 6 hours sleep in the last 72 hours. Not Good. Not good at all. I sat down and sorted thru all the mail hoping to find one of my room mates stuff and calming down. No luck. Luckily I had the lease agreement in my bag and realized that Mr. Roos is the same Mr. Roos who signed the other part of this lease. I calmed down found a couch and passed out.   By tuesday night, i had moved most of my stuff into the house and was officially able to breathe. I sat down and caught up on some TV. After watching some  Queer Eye for the Straight Guy , i finally got around to watching  The O.C.  which might be the best show on TV ever.  The only real comparison to  90210  is that no one on the show (outside of Seth) looks like they are 25. Other than that, the show is clearly superior. Of course, at this point in my mind the only thing I remember about  90210  was the 7 season story arc about whether Donna and David would have sex and the secondary 3 season story arc where we were waiting for Val's head to stop growing.  Anyway, loved  The O.C.  but watching that right after  Queer Eye  got me all stressed out:        The convergence of Peter Gallagher's out of controll eye brows after watching Kyan get all freaked out over some fat guy's back hair reminded me that I was in bad need of an EYE BROW WAXING.  Peter, buddy, you're on TV, your eye brows have been freaking me out since  American Beauty , get something done.   Metrosexual move of the week  Wednesday, motivated and disturbed, I hopped down the hill to College Ave, got a hair cut and a waxing. While getting my waxing, I noticed that they had all sorts of  Nickel  brand men's grooming products at 40% off, i started doing doing my dainty dance, all excited about how my facial skin was going to come back after 3 months of neglect in Brazil. They were discontinuing carrying the line, but would be happy to special order stuff for me to pick up whenever I got waxed. i was all set! Yah! The women also shared where I, a man of class and distinction could go to buy men's grooming products without risking stigmatization from people who would not understand or accept. I nodded at them appreciatively and agreed to come back in a month's time. My whole life, coming together before my eyes! YAY!  At least till, I decided I would jog back up the hills to my place, which is about 2 miles away and at some substantial elevation. Woops. Boy did that suck, 90 degrees, running up hill, at NOON, with all sorts of loose hairs from a haircut and mildly irritated forehead from the eye brow waxing. There was question as to whether I would make it. I'm still not sure how i did, seeing as how I had to stop to scratch the itchy loose hairs everywhere. ILL  wow, sorry, i dont have a meaningful ending. whatever...

        Kicking it up a notch  Yo, due to popular demand, we are going to keep the blog going. However, I must admit, I think we need to kick it up a notch and bring some new blood into the blog. Over the next few days I will approaching certain charismatic individuals (such as yourselves) about posting from time to time. I think so far the blog has been a raging success, from our in depth sports to coverage to our anticipation of the current "cool gay stuff" fad.  In honor of all that, I got a new feature "Metrosexual Move of the Week" and other stuff coming along the pike.   My flight back from Brazil is worth mentioning. My Itinerary went like this  8pm flight from Sao Paulo to Miami was delayed for two hours, so it departed at 10pm local time. My visa had expired so I had to sign all these form indicating I would pay some fine once I returned to the country. I laughed at the federal police officer and offered a calming "sure, whatever". In the Duty Free I picked up some cachasa, which was realy smart what with me carrying an 80lb backpack and a shopping bag full of souveniers.    5:30 local time. I arrive in Miami after watching  Down with Love  (booo) and  Agent Cody Banks  (yah!) My opinion on these movies is entirely dependant on my tolerance for the females in the film. I have not enjoyed a film Renee Zellweger has been in since  Empire Records . On the other side, I thought Angie Harmon rocked. I finally understand why Jason Sehorn can't cover me on the football field anymore, he spends all his time staring at his wife. I know I would. But I digress, I got to Miami and was informed I had to clear customs and immigration and the department of agriculture and whatever else AFTER I claimed my baggage, and after all the processing I would again recheck my luggage. At every point, I was told that I need to run to make my connection to Orlando.  "I'm not telling you to run, but if I were you I would run. Where have you been?"  "waiting for my luggage."  "well hurry up"  "the plane was DELAYED. Its not like its me that sucking, the plane was two hours late"  "whatever"  "god damn right whatever...what?"  In orlando i met the parents and Bump who took me to breakfast, after making fun of me for two hours and then dropped me off again so I could go to HelL. A. because the Scooter was marrying his long time love, Cathy, in SB (congrats to those crazy kids, ALL the BEST BABY)  In the airport in Atlanta (don't ask) I stopped to use Laptop Lane and was immediately bombarded by Thai and others on the IM. before I jumped off I downloaded a bunch of taylor dane songs, I was delirious with exhaustion, but for some reason i was thinking of Taylor Dane, strange.  In the rental car ( a penis shaped silver Dodge Intrepid) on the 405, I nearly broke down crying. I was tired and for some reason it took me an hour to go 13 miles to get to the free way to SB (13? I dont remember).   I arrived to the rehearsal dinner at 8pm Pacific Time (after a quick check in/shower at the hotel) and somehow found a second (or a third wind). By 2 am, I was in a Special K with 5 other people buying booze to take back to my hotel to continue drinking.   By 8am saturday morning, I was re-enacting scenes from leaving Las Vegas, I woke up shaking and still more drunk than hung over surrounded by bottles and odd mixing ingredients (squirt? hawian punch? what?)  The wedding itself was outstanding, casual elegance is the best way to describe it. Definitely one of the niftiest weddings I have been too (aside from the classic Cheo wedding where I was also a groomsman and got to wear a top hat and had a cane that I could use to ditty bop with had I needed to. Shout out to Cheo) The couple looked smashing and the families represented themselves well by taking the microphone to share a few amusing annecdotes and make moving speeches. For myself, I did my part as groomsman and balanced out the height (all the bridesmaids were over 5' 11''!!!) and take up some space. I too, was elegant, if understated...and worked hard on not sweating, which is a lot more work than it seems.  Somehow after the wedding, we did a rinse repeat on the whole drinking in my hotel room pissing off the people next door. Around 4am we tried to get some cabs and encountered an annoying front desk receptionist. Dr T (of the infamous Crack Pack) amused himself by crank calling her for the next hour or so!  By Sunday I was on the plane back from LA to Oakland. I got to my new house (pics to be posted forthcoming) and had to break in to get in the house as no one was there.   this is a long entry. back later with more.

       I have not posted anything for a while so I figured I would just riff and hope to say something interesting  Mike Tyson is broke which is pretty nuts. I remember running into the Champ at the Time Hotel I was hanging out with some people I did not know (or like for that matter), so in a sad attempt to impress them I tried to roll over and pretend I rolled with Iron Mike. I was all like "Champ, let me roll with you, yo" he looked at me and said something to the effect of "you gotta be kidding me".  Still love ya Champ.  Who else is pumped up about watching "O.C." on Fox this Fall???    I think the standard by which all facial hair should be judged is George Michael. This picture does not even do justice to what is actually going on with his face. There is a lot of stuff going on there. Check it out for yourself when you can.  Seriously, it must take 3 shaves a day to maintain that stuff.     Counting today, I have two days left working and 3 days left in SP. I would be remiss if I did not give a shout out to the crowd that more or less adopted me while I was in Brazil. I am going to make up names for most of them right now; Charles River Bandit, PrincessPZ, DirtyP for keeping things interesting and the crew at New Citi Flats for keeping me from smelling interesting.

According to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Amazin's are the team to beat when it comes to amazingly gay facial hair... at LOTS of it. I only noticed this today while watching the Mets vs. Cardinals on channel 11. This is what happens to people who don't have cable TV: they get stuck watching the adopted stepchild of New York baseball. Wait, did I have a point? I'm not sure. All I know is that I spent the last 30 minutes on mlb.com pulling the URLs of Mets players. How GAY IS THAT?!? (Someone shoot me.)

        Evil     The nice thing about summer is that you can buy peaches and plums on the cheap. There's a Pakistani guy up the street who mans a fruit stand on weekdays. I buy a crapload of peaches and plums from him and he'll usually throw in a mango or whatnot. That guy is cool. Peaches and plums are cool. But you know what's NOT cool? Those damn fruit flies.  I'm trying to get the fruit flies to leave my apartment and one of the things I'm doing is to not have any organic matter in the garbage cans. So I find myself sitting around, eating peaches and plums... but what to do with the pits? Well, I've recently developed the hobby of pelting pigeons with fruit pits. Hey, I'm no Doc Gooden, but it turns out that my arm isn't half bad. I might even try out for Little League next spring.  On an unrelated note, I'd like to point out that X-TIAN is applying a double standard to me vs. Gary Sheffield. Why does Gary Sheffield get a big WORD UP, whereas I got a decidedly negative reaction for saying the exact same thing just the day before:  EVIL: i look tooly in a dress shirt EVIL: there's too much room around the collar X-TIAN: why is that? EVIL: i am temporarily under my normal weight X-TIAN: oh X-TIAN: why temporarily? EVIL: my shirts have to accomodate for a 20 pound swing EVIL: in the winter i'm around 180 pounds EVIL: right now i am 162 EVIL: i sweat more in the summer X-TIAN: thats pretty gross EVIL: i guess EVIL: i hope no one notices all this room around my collar EVIL: it's embarrassing EVIL: i am wearing a $95 but ill-fitting shirt X-TIAN: nice

        Dear Hose,   Long time reader, 3rd time posting....What has happened?  When did this blogspot became Evil's blogspot...my god, hardly anybody else writes and all he does is rant about something or other....Doesn't he have anything else to do? Doesn't he have like a job or something? Oh wait....  Anyways, even if Friends its a foreign concept or if you feel uncomfortable watching Will & Grace for whatever Metrosexual reasons you may have, I implore everybody to start watching Coupling on NBC.  Rena Sofer is freaking hot and I can't keep popping my "Keeping the Faith" DVD just to see her in action...     Hey Xtian...you remember rushing to Astoria to catch "Ed" on Wednesday nights...yeah yeah!!!

        Perfect Gentlemen   Back in Winter of 2001 I was living in Astoria with Manolo and Bad Will Hunting. On ocassion one of Manolo's pimpalicious friends would show up and drag us with him to Flashdancers. Manolo went far more often than I did, a fact I discovered only after I accidently thought his credit card bill was mine.   Anywho, going to FDs is kind of a slippery slope. Once you start its kind of hard to stop and it becomes the fall back plan for any night that is shaping up to be pretty lame.  Manolo and I had this running joke  10pm (any night of the week)  Me: what are you up to?  Manolo: I dunno. what are you up to?  Me: Nothing. That's why I was wondering what you were up to  Manolo: Nah,man not me. I got nothing.  Then we would book for the door and try to hail a cab and hit FDs. In our defense we probably only got out the door, maybe 2-3 times. But the other 20 times we both knew we wanted to go but neither of us wanted to be the one actually responsbile for spendig all that money.  But like I admitted earlier. We went and pretty often. Besides, for us Astoria types it was really easy. you're in a cab, you're going to midtown anyway because that's where the 59th St Bridge (Queensbridge for y'all who know) is and you know, its a quick right instead of a quick left and BAM! boobage!  These days, 2.5 years later, I am seeing similarly disturbing patterns emerging.  I'm just minding my own, when i hear a few clowns doing a quick exchange:  "New Century?"  "New Century."  (Cut to the Batmoble) Not that I am actively participating in it. In fact at this point in my life I might be disgusted with the whole scene or maybe just the place that some friends of mine like to go to. I have only been once. When you enter you are given a large fountain cup and when you walk into the joint there is a fountain machine, where you can drink as much HiC or Coke as you want. CLASSY! I have only been once but these cats are rolling over there on the regular.  Bit much for my tastes.  As Mr. Shoulders used to say whenever he swung through FDs  "I'll take the Go-Go-Rama on rt 35 any day!"

        Evil  Hey yo. I haven't been around. Just got back from a detox center in Florida. I did happen to catch the California debate on JetBlue last nite tho. I think it's officially over for California. When is Bill Clinton going to step in and save the day?  What else?  Oh, after living most of my life in New York, I spotted a celebrity for the first time last week. I was going in to a meeting at 1440 Broadway and saw P. Diddy at the elevator banks. He was dishing out a bunch of demands to his crew. I tried to get in to the same elevator car as him, but these two goons were not going to have any of it. (Turns out that the Sean John offices are in 1440 Broadway, but that's not why I was there.)  What else?  Kentaro has been very quiet lately. What's going on? Has Ken been putting in some extra hours as Theo Epstien's right hand man? Engineering the Red Sox's post-season run?  What else?   Sorry I'm a little late on the news, but remember the Guantanamo army chaplain who got was accused of spying? His name is Captain James Yee. C'mon now... doesn't he look like any one of 4 or 5 people who you know? That guy could be anyone. I think he sort of looks like this kid Noph from Columbia.

        Jets   This   year the Jets are 0-2  Last year the Jets, Started the season 1-3 but Vinny went down and was replaced by the Chad. Who led the NFL in QB rating and made late season run into the Playoffs, embarrasing the Colts on their way to getting pushed around by the Raiders in the second round of the playoffs.  In 2001, The NY Football Jets started the season 1-2 (i think) before coming back, heating up and making a late play off run.  In 2000, the Jets finished 9-7 in the a season that included the monday Night Miracle and 3 wins early where they were outplayed embarrasingly until Al Groh finally cut loose Vinny and the Spread (eagle) offense.  In 1999, Vinny went down in game 1 and the Jets started the season horribly. After surviving the Rick Mirir debacle they brought in Big Play Ray Lucas, who earned himself a decent contract by leading the Jets to a respectable 8-8 record after some major upsets including smacking the Dolphins around something awful on a monday that I proudly recall.  In 1998, the J-E-T-S started the season with Glenn Foley who went down in Game 3, and was replaced by Vinny who led the team to a 12-4 record and an appearance in the AFC Championship game.  Where am I going with this...not sure....except that the Jets have not figured out how to start a season to save their life in the last 5 years.

        Evil  A taco eating competition... hmm. Sounds intriguing, but you know what... I'll have to pass. I do enjoy some taco once in a while, but I don't see myself munching on a long line of them. Who knows where they've been? Those eating competitions never really look like they meet the minimum bar for cleanliness. Besides, I hate eating something and feeling bad about it afterwards. You chicks in the audience are probably familiar with that feeling, right? The second you are done swallowing, that guilt smacks you in the face. It's all about self love. Speaking of which... Shout out to MR. SHOULDERS. Just making sure he's still alive.

       Linen should generally only be worn while sailing or possibly at a BBQ. I know NYers tend to just wear it whenever its not cold but I am pretty sure that is overkill. The stuff wrinkles to easily and where can you walk around being wrinkled and not look dumb.   I usually keep it in the closet unless there is a polo match to attend.   This  urlLink commercial  seems to be part of some MBA backlash that I did not know existed. Its funny, i mean Jeremy Shockey backlash I understand, the guy is totally over exposed but are MBAs really that over exposed?  Wierd...  Speaking of backlash there is already some to my unfortunate Haasweek column,  The Hustle , which is going to be a weekly feature. As soon as it gets posted on the Haasweek site, I will post a link.  For those of you who don't know it will focus on my work to find a job. So far I have put zero effort into it, so imagine what the first article will be about.

As such, I am submitting the first question to X-TIAN's advice column in hopes that he'll answer it.  Dear X-TIAN,  People say that you can't wear white pants after Labor Day. But is it OK to wear linen pants after Labor Day? (Non-white ones, of course.) I don't feel as tho I've worn enough linen this year and want to get in a few more linen days before it becomes ass cold in NYC.  Unrelated...  I never did get that fly. Damn fly.

        Gay Cruise???   So I just recently spent a few days in the Caribbean, and boy oh boy, are my arms tired! (rim shot)…  Anyways, I was on a 10 day cruise through the Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.  Good times, good times!!!   And no Mr. Evil, it was not a gay cruise!!!  A few general warnings though for anyone thinking of taking a cruise…  1) Make sure you hit the gym before taking a cruise…I don’t mean you need to be all Adonis like but it’s a fact that you will gain 15-20 pounds when everything is said and over.  There is food left and right and you really never stop eating.  I think I hit my low point when I took my pent-up aggression against the French and their lack of support for the war in Iraq by eating all by myself a 4 feet tall chocolate Eiffel Tower...(picture to come later).  2) Do not talk to old ladies…As we were leaving port one day, we were buffeted by huge gusts of wind.  Anyways, there was this old woman holding on to her hat for dear life which meant that her flower dress was flapping in the winds, and yes, she had no underwear on.  I assume she didn’t know what kind of show she was putting on so I politely informed her of the fact.  She resentfully turned to me and stated “Listen SONNY, this is a new hat and I am not letting it go. What I have down there is 82 years old and if you or anybody else on this boat gets off by staring at my 82 year-old pu$$&, there is really nothing I can do about it."   3) Please be aware that any mirrors you see are two-way mirrors and is a good indication of where the security office is.  After 9/11, they take security very seriously.  If you see a door marked “Crew”, do not feel inclined to walk in looking for the crew’s night club/bar.  Otherwise, you will find yourself behind one of the aforementioned two-way mirrors watching people pick their nose…  4) And finally, at no point ask a crew member when the next chimp knife fights or the bullfights are going to start…They don’t really get to watch the Simpsons that often on TV and don’t find it funny as you or I….    Yankee Fan in South Florida   The last week or so have been really tough for this Yankee fan…I am still shell shocked that the Yankees lost…I will be honest and tell you that I didn’t mind it Saturday night that much.  Perhaps it was because the loss was still too fresh or that the good people of South Beach decided to strip and run naked down Ocean Drive…   I was really upset this past Tuesday though as I had to constantly waltz past all these new found Marlins fans.  The Marlins have fans coming out of the woodworks like little cockroaches… I will bury them cockroaches...  With the possible exception of Venezuela who fields a baseball team during the winter league season, I am especially upset at the South Americans…Freaking Ecuadorians and Colombians and Peruvians and Brazilians walking around Calle Ocho waving their flags like they won the World Cup or something.  Xtian, you were in Brazil this summer…did you see any kids playing baseball in the means streets of Rio de Janeiro???  I doubt it very much...

In any event, do need clarification on one thing X-TIAN posted:   Evil has been abstaining from  not  masturbating for about 10 years.   Did you mean to have that "not" in there? Because I don't really understand what you're trying to say.  On an unrelated note... the NYC Marathon is this Sunday. I'm considering fasting from now until then just to clear up my entire intestinal tract. I don't want any weird accidents at mile #22 or whatnot.

       Evil has been abstaining from not masturbating for about 10 years. I know for reasons I would rather not get into right now.  Evil does have a good point though, Jane Campion's new film  In the Cut  apparently stars Meg Ryan's feet not Meg Ryan as the trailer would lead you to believe...kinky.  Additionally,  American Psycho  was directed by Mary Herron and I can't think of a more erotic movie from the last ten years...

        Evil  OUTDATED MOVIE REVIEW  I caught Sofia Coppola's film -- Lost in Translation -- over the weekend. The movie posters show Bill Murray sitting on a bed. He's wearing a robe and bath slippers. Someone really missed the boat on marketing this film. The female lead, Scarlett Johansson is a HOT piece of ass. And I mean that literally. The film opens with an tight shot of her tight ass in see-thru panties. A good 60 seconds of ass camera work.  The thing about this movie is that I had a hell of a time keeping my hands out of my pants. Not only that, I had to really fight off the urge to give myself a happy ending right there in the theater. Hey, it's dark right? But anyway, I'm pretty sure this has something to do with female directors. They pace a movie differently than male directors. They build up tension very differently. I felt very manipulated (emotionally, that is) several times during the movie, including at the end. The tension of this movie reminds me of The Piano, which was directed by Jane Campion. The cinematography couldn't be more different between the two but the emotional ebb and flows are the same. Hey, I worked in the word "flow" while discussing a female issue. Woooo!  Anyway, all this analysis makes me want to do something pants-less. Please excuse me. Laters...

Rough patch. That's what happened to the Yankees.  Joe Torre should have called on me to pinch hit. I could have driven in a run or two. I'm sorry to disappoint everyone who was looking for me to get in the game. Actually, I was also surprised that X-TIAN didn't get any game action for the Marlins, seeing as he's a flexible switch hitter and all. (Yes, X-TIAN plays for the other team.)  Oh well. Whatever. The Yankees will re-sign Paul O'Neill and everything will be alright again.

        Evil   Seriously procrastinating here... I've got 6 more days to wrap up this business school application but I can't seem to overcome this desire to sit around shirtless and scratch my belly. I think I'm channeling some Jack Black. That guy is my new hero maybe. He's like the poor man's Robert Downey Jr. Super talented, minus the heroine.  Has anyone been watching the World Series? I've watched mostly with my pants off and even then it wasn't that exciting. Last night I found myself flipping thru the channels and watching The Bachelor during commercial breaks. This season's Bachelor is somewhat interesting because the bachelor is a Former Fat Guy. He's all self-deprecating and stuff. He's the type of guy who gets his wallet lifted in the subway and then spends a good 30 minutes verbally berating himself in public.  Wait, I was commenting about the World Series. Yes... Has anyone noticed the complexity of Ugeth Urbina's facial hair? There's no way that guy isn't a fruitcake. (Sleeve, I checked the MLB.com photo gallery for a recent pic of Urbina but couldn't find one. What's up with that?!)  Someone in the apartment below me is playing the tuba. Who even plays a tuba anymore? This person isn't actually playing anything with a melody, just a bunch of scales. Over and over. This might drive me insane pretty soon.

        Evil   RANDOM THOUGHTS WHILE HAVING MY MORNING COFFEE   One.  Obligatory comment about last night's baseball game: Thank goodness I don't have to watch the Red Sox anymore. I developed OCD somewhere around game 3 and I'm hoping it'll wear off at some point. What's with Nomar's insane wrist tapping between every pitch? I dunno, but I find it very addictive. Every time he comes to the plate, I find myself tapping my own wrists just like he does. I was driving myself insane.   Two.  Why are my people  urlLink putzing around in space ? I get ragged on because I use the phrase  "That's my bag, baby!"  at least once a day and Austin Powers is a 6 year old movie. Sending people into space is so JFK-esque, but then again, all of China's political leaders are the same age as what JFK would be today. If you ask me, China should allocate 100% of its scientific resources toward genetically engineering more Yao Ming's. How much would that rock. I'm pretty sure that Yao himself is genetically engineered but he's just a prototype. The production model is expected to feature: better peripheral vision for passing, greater overall athleticism, and a suave British accent.   Three.   I used to think that the high school I went to, Stuyvesant HS in New York City, was for smart kids. That's what they kept telling us. After reading  urlLink this article  in the New York Times, I've determined that I went to a clown high school. Some outtakes from the article:   At Stuyvesant High School, the tales are similar. "Someone brought in a universal remote and walked through the halls turning on all the TV's in classrooms," one Stuyvesant junior said. ... another added that her friend often used a minilaser pointer to put a moving red dot on the teacher's backside whenever he turned away from the class.    C'mon now. Next thing you know, kids are going to be pelting their classmates in the back of the head with Skittles.

        Collection of Columns from the School Paper   I have been writing a weekly column about my job search in the school paper, Haasweek. Its pretty low stress i turn something in sometime thursday and it gets published after the language gets cleaned up a bit. Apparently my school paper allows all sorts of curse words to be published. Who knew.  Since the  urlLink website  for haasweek has not been updated since April, I have taken to posting unedited (as in unedited for grammar and misspelling erros) versions  urlLink here .

        How to make enemies   when you city hasn't won a World Series in 95 years, and hasn't been in one in 58 years, and your ace pitcher is cruising with a shutout, and your team is only 5 outs away from winning the NL pennant. You do not cost them that next out and spark an 8 run rally for the opposing team that has only been in existance for 10 years and has already won a World Series in that time.  i think it's safe to say that we are all lucky today to not be  urlLink this guy .

        Joe Lavin is sort of my spiritual mentor   I have been reading Joe Lavin's stuff for a long time. He's great because he's so freaking funny but does not seem to make any money off his genius. He apparently has written a book, which he might publish himself, at kinkos, on an order by order basis. Anyway, he's awesome and he's prolific and he writes and he has a website  urlLink here .   Really, if he's not a father for the principles behind blogging, he's definitely the dirty uncle that showed that showed it porn and taught it about picking up girls.

        KIll Chris      Dude I dug this movie something aweful. Every once in a while, I go watch a movie and think the guy is making it just for me. I had that feeling in this movie.  From the opening with the "Old Klingon Proverb" (which is not actually an old Klingon Proverb it comes from Pierre Ambroise Francois Choderios de LaClos (1741-1803). He originally said it in French in his 1782 book Les Liasons Dangereuses (translates to english- Dangerous Liasons))   To the Anime "origin story" of Lucy Lui's character  To the very cool homages to Spagetti westerns, old Kung Fu movies and even the Matrix (kinda...see picture above)  Plus its about Chicks who kick ass, which if you read my  urlLink friendster  entry is what i am all about.

Check out this funny quote from a female pro golfer:   In the course of answering Kessler's questions about the LPGA's marketing problems, Stephenson said: "This is probably going to get me in trouble, but the Asians are killing our tour. Absolutely killing it. Their lack of emotion, their refusal to speak English when they can speak English. They rarely speak.

       Wednesday I was at Bar of the Week with a bunch of classmates. Normally, I sit these things out because I would much rather, sit around, watch  Angel  and dwell on some classic thought (Kant, St. Augustine...you name it) But I had run into a first year who was a friend of mine from before when we worked together. She claimed to have never gone to a BOW. I felt obligated to correct that so I dragged her along as I made my presence felt.  Immediately i gravitated towards the TV. Pedro was done after 135 pitches. Someone from New England looked at me judgingly and asked me where my alligences lay. I thought about it for a second...   Because I am a Mets fan I hate the Yankees Because I hate the Yankees I like to see the Yankees loose. There are lots of Yankee haters in Boston I like rooting for Manny and Pedro for reasons I have never really figured out  I live in the East Bay about 5 minutes from where the As play I am rooting for the Red Sox over the As?  Yeah I'm not sure why either. F****ing Yankees!   Generic East Bay Plan #1   My saturday drifted dangerously towards  Swingers  territory.  I was on a panel in the early morning so most of my day was shot. I spent a ridiculous amount of the afternoon drifting from my bed to the couch and back finding new ways to fall asleep. I managed to sleep thru most of A's vs Red Sox Game (go sox?!?!?!)  Just as Trot Nixon hit the game winning homerun a friend of mine showed up. I never asked but I imagined his girlfriend was out of town and that's why he was coming through. He was kicking himself for coming between innings. i was kicking myself for sleeping through it . I was also trying to find some lucidity. He asked who hit it, looking at the screen I said "Mueller, no...Miller...Varitek?"   "Oh, Trot Nixon...huh?"  He, one of my roommates and I decided we would come up with a plan for the evening as I basked in the glow of a Red Sox win and wondered if Pedro would pitch again.  We ended up at Le Cheval for dinner and sat around and stared at two distinct groups of people. Since Le Cheval is upscale Vietnamese, its mostly upscale east bay asians. however, in the mix were a crowd of single, six ft tall white women. My roommate found it strange and sad, in a way that a table of 3 single upscale males eating dinner together is also strange. Additionally there was a couple there where a woman had her entire arm adorned with a huge elaborate tatoo.  After dinner we swung over the Lucky Lounge which at best looks like a swinging singles joint from the seventies and at worst looks like a dive with ratty couches.   Me in the 97 Jetta parked in between an A8 and a Lamborgini.  We walked in and stood around trying to attract attention.  Eventually the same two crowds of people that we had spied at Le Cheval showed up. Biker Chick and the Lonely Hearts Club invaded the Lucky Lounge to over pay for drinks and pretend they live in NY.   Was this the generic East Bay plan? Apparently...who knew...good thing i live close to the city.

But did you also know that P. Diddy is also doing it? Yes, kiddies.  urlLink Check out his website  (not to mention the wack domain name).  Apparently, he's been training for... 3 weeks! I don't care WHAT Jimmy The Greek says. I better not finish behind anyone who's been training for only 3 weeks.  What else?  Hmmm... well, I just got back from Cambridge. Visited Sloan all day Tuesday and HBS all day Wednesday. Here's what I learned while visiting business schools:  1. The stupidest looking person at the info session always asks the stupidest question.  2. Someone who has been accused of being a bad driver and also having no direction sense really has no business driving around Boston.  3. Errr...  Okay fine. I didn't learn a lot. What do you want from me?

        Outdated Movie Review   I caught Jon Favreau's new movie,  ELF  today. Well, its not really that new at all...now is it. I got to admit, for a kiddie movie/hollywood fluff there was a lot there to stare at.  The north pole scenes made me think of those old ass stop motion animation Christmas specials that they used to show on CBS when i was a kid and that took me back into all these childhood memories about Christmas. Like the time I bitched to my parents that they didn't even try that Santa Claus gag with me, and the next morning (like december 3rd) there was a gift from Santa under the tree. Or that time my mom took me to Toys-r-Us and asked me which toys I would like for christmas, promptly bought them all, wrapped them, threw them under the tree and handed them out to all my cousins on Christmas, while she handed me some socks or underwear...(f*** YOU, dude! I want Zartan!)  Where was I? Oh yeah, the movie! So what I liked. I liked Zoey Deschanel! She rocks. She is really attractive in a japanese anime kind of way. I like her being cynical and with a slouched back, in my wierd fantasies that's usually how she is.  I liked the cameo by Amy Sedaris (sister of David) and the shout out to David Sedaris' book  Santa Land Diaries  , " Did Crumpet send you?". Nice, subtle. Well played. But what was not subtle and what saved the movie is Will Ferrell. I have decided that will be in my movie when i make it and he's going to play my brother. Damn that dude is great. Hah!

        Evil   THANKSGIVING AND MY FAMILY (PART 1)  For the most part, my family doesn't eat together at the table anymore. It started years back -- I had just entered college at the time -- and my parents moved from Jackson Heights to Flushing. The new house had a dining room, but from the start my dad claimed it as his office space. Besides, with me leaving the house, my sister already in college, my dad with his erratic work schedule,  it only made sense to use the dining room for something practical. On occasions when we did get together as a family, we would just eat scattered about the house and that seemed fine to everyone.  I mention this bit of history because I spent Thanksgiving with my parents and grandparents. My uncles, aunts, and cousins were there too. This was at my grandparents' house so they actually had a dining room table and as such, I sat down to a meal with family for the first time in quite a while. My dad made me sit next to him, which I guess was fine because it beats sitting next to any of my strange uncles.  We have this one uncle, Second Uncle, who was in the military for many years and fought on the front lines in Vietnam. We're all pretty sure that the experience made him somewhat crazy. He's unmarried, works in a factory, and has several gold teeth -- old school style. He likes to talk about "the war" and offer to break out the old black and white photos of him in his army uniform.  And then there's Third Uncle, but everyone calls him Fat Uncle because, well, because he's fat. My family is creative like that. But anyway, I try to avoid Fat Uncle as much as possible because he's always pestering me to mentor his son, who of course, is my cousin. My cousin is 2 years younger than me and has been trying to complete his undergraduate degree going on 7 years now. He's declared and undeclared majors in business management, American literature, and international relations. He lives in his parents' basement and emerges into the light only to play networked games on the PC. I mean really, what am I supposed to do for this kid?  Lastly, there's Fourth Uncle, but since he's the last, we call him Small Uncle. In his youth, Small Uncle dreamed of being the biggest pop star in all of Vietnam. He's 36 now and in some ways, he's still holding on to that dream. About once or twice a month, he'll work a gig at a Vietnamese wedding, doing the MC'ing and singing. Apparently (according to my dad), there's quite a demand for Small Uncle in the Vietnamese wedding circles. Who knew?  One time, my dad told me that Small Uncle has promised to sing at my wedding and my immediate reaction was to make this gesture of a noose going around my neck and snapping taut. My dad was so disappointed at my outright disrespect that he simply lowered his eyelids and shook his head. My mom caught hold of the entire exchange but she kept in the background, as she was nearly doubled over in laughter. My mom does a lot of that stuff -- hanging in the background and laughing at other people (mostly at family).   Part 2... coming soon.

        Road Trip!!!   In a couple of hours, I will be leaving for O-Town, Orlando for those not familiar with the "Dirty South." I am going to be hanging out with my former roomate Bad Will Hunting and his brother (his fantasy baseball league team name was CreamOfSomeYoungThai).  I think we are ready to start scouring the Magic Kingdom for some boobage...I am ready to try one of those patented moves I read here in the blog a while back, you know, the one where you just grab the girls arm or something or other.  If you get a collect call from Orlando, please take the call.  Its probably me calling for bail money because Minnie is pressing charges.  I just hope its not as lame as when  urlLink Los Bros. Barrera invaded Miami.    Big Head / Little Big Head   Yo, are you guys going to be in town for Thanksgiving?...I have been meaning to pay a visit to that hot spot of Orlando's nightlife, what is it called?   Oh yeah, Rachel's Steak and Gentlemen Club...Give me a call on my cell if you want to hang...

       I wholeheartedly agree with Xtian's rant concerning TV characters who  just get too f**king lucky. Its screws up our youth.  Do you remember when Saved By the Bell's Zach - a moron who couldn't even think of clever schemes to avoid detention or that horny psycopath Screech- got a near perfect SAT score and was recruiruited by Harvard? Godamn Harvard, people. Zach Morris would not even be capable of handling ITT Tech.  I blame shows like this for scewing my vision of reality and contributing to my breakdown when I ate ding-dongs, watched the Nanny, and played foosball during senior year instead of studying and was then rejected by Harvard. "Zach got in - so why can't I?" I'm so sick of situations working out for TV characters. Although I love them, I kind've want to see them suffer [is that normal?]  However, I disagree with you XTian concerning Kelly. I want to see more of 90210 Kelly Taylors -- pretty girls who get shot at,  burned, robbed, abused, kidnapped,  cheated on 18 times, in addition to getting drawn into a cult by lesbians [Dec. Season five].  Now that's refreshing and entertaining.

        BRITNEY SPEARS PERFORMING ARTS FOUNDATION CAMP APPLICATION:      NAME:  Rina [last name withheld by COB]  AGE:  21  LOCATION:  200 [street name withheld by COB], New York, NY  TALENT:  Being just like Britney  DID YOU INCLUDE $25 APPLICATION FEE?   Yes, and one of my favorite thongs as well    PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY YOU ARE QUALIFIED AND WANT TO JOIN CAMP BRITNEY:      When I first performed on Star Search, I remember losing to some Ku Klux Klan 10 -year old pimply shithead who sang Whitney Houston's "I Wanna Dance With Somebody." After he kicked me in the groin, infected me with Type 2 cooties, and stole my candy machine money, I held my arm out to heaven and swore as God as my witness, I'll never let white trash win again. To me, that's what Britney embodies - not letting trash like Christina Aguilera or Willa Ford prevail in the radio-airwave battle for pop music icons.  Over the past years, I’ve studied and emulated Britney's strategic moves:  pigtails, wearing slutty clothing while claiming to be wholesome, lying about my sexual history,  dancing erotically, dating a gay pop singer, and kissing older women.    I've taken numerous belly-dancing and stripper dance classes at New York’s esteemed Baby Doll Gentlemen’s Club in addition to training with zoo snakes and sea lions in preparation for my future MTV VMA skanky dance performance. Whenever I wrap a baby seal around my shoulders and swing my hips back in forth while singing "I'm a Slave For You," I can strongly feel the presence of Britney's spirit. I think of how Britney overcame her leg injury and gathered the courage to pose virtually topless in Esquire and it gives me the strength to venture sans-bra to the corner supermarket to pick up some Campbell's canned tomato soup. I understand the incredible impact Britney has on my generation and I want to join the forces of Britney's PR campaign to help transform more young pre-pubescent girls into her hot-ass image.     At Camp Britney, I intend to express my singing and acting talents and hopefully pick up a nasally Southern drawl - just like my BritBrit. In addition to performing in my 2nd grade "Hanukkah Maccabe spectacular," I also hum the Beverly Hills 90210 theme every time I drive in L.A. and know all 23 Old Navy commercial jingles by heart. In addition, I have recorded, on my Hello Kitty personal tape recorder,  my very own version of Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back" called "Brit's got a rack"    I hope you will consider me as a candidate for Camp Britney as I look forward to spreading the gospel of Pop's Princess to those less fortunate without MTV or Access Hollywood. I can't wait to have naked pillowfights and roast nuts Brit! See you soon!  XOXO, Rina

        TV Educations   Had a pretty long breakfast conversatin about Party of Five this morning with one of my roommates. After a while we realized that neither one of us remembered anything about season 6. Although I do recall a lot about the ill-fated,  Time of Your Life    spin off that featured Jennifer Love Hewitt's character.   Anyway, interest pequed I hit  urlLink TvTome  to figure out what fate befell the poor Salinger family, kids that could never catch a break.   Apparently, Julia wrote a book (the hell? wasn;t she like a stripper? and what about Griffen? Was he still working as a grease monkey?) Charlie married Kirstin (i guess it stuck that time) Claudia went to Stanford (over Julliard...weren't these kids left orphan?? are they actually the descedants of JD Salinger?) Here's the kicker....freaking Baily, useless quiter, boozer baily who managed to flunk out of San Fran Community State College (or was it Pen.) somehow moved to Philly to attend the Wharton School of Business????  The hell???  that's bullsh*t. In a rage, I checked with Scooter about this. He was amused and confused as well, but also pointed out that 90210 ended with boozer, coke head, cultist, Kelly leaving the zip code we all don't know but love for the warm embrace of morningside heights, to attend Grad school AT COLUMBIA!!!  Are you kidding me? Are there any other shows where characters get cut a break on the season finale just so no one has to worry about them anymore? what a cop out! write me if you can think of another one...  See that's what made Buffy the Vampire Slayer a superior show, most characters (Zandar, Cordelia) didn't even get into college (freaking Oz got held back!!!) and those that did (Buffy and Willow) quickly flunked out admist a wave of slaying, lesbianism, S&M and addiction....that's reality (well except the vampires maybe)

        A Man of Limited means and talent...   can still put it on Big Dog style when he needs to.      Fill in your own backstory. Here's mine:   His suit looks sharp, but its bargain basement from a Ralph Lauren Outlet store. It was one of those rare finds. You know how it goes at the Outlets, you walk from rack to rack, sticking your hand in there and fishing about, bogarting every old lady within 5 ft of you. Most times you come empty handed, every once in a while you find a sharp pinstripe suit and somehow run out with it. The shirt looks decent too, except our hero neglects to tell anyone its a Today's Man knock off of a far more expensive shirt. The cigar is of the low end on a good brand.   The whole look costs 200 bucks at most....what a posuer  While we're on the subject, why are his eyes closed? Like I said, posuer...

        Wish List   here's the shit i want to be given to me this holiday season. You guys can pool your IPO and MBA moneys and get me one.      urlLink  Flava Flav Alarm Clock   $85  I currently wake up to your standard alarm-clock radio, usually set to NPR. While NPR is good about switching up the content daily, enough so to keep my interest so i don't hit the snoze button. I can't help but think I'd wake up in a good mood and pop right outta bed in 2004 if i was awaken with any of these phrases:  Bass In Your Face ,  Get Up Get Down ,  Yo G Yo , or  Yeaa Boy .      urlLink  20 GB iPod   $399  C'mon, i'm like the last person without one of these. I'm not even asking for the 40 GB version cause i don't even think there are 10,000 songs in the world that i like, much less want as my background soundtrack as i run or walk around the city.   Laser Eye Surgery  ~ $1000  I feel like i waited long enough for this procedure to mature, i've been scared to do it for the last 5 years or so, cause i felt i would turn out to be like one of those women that got the first breast implants a few decades ago and they eventually ruptured or got all hard and bumpy.

I feel like she just left me and my little brother alone in the house because “Mommy wants a cocktail.”

        Evil   A conversation between Bill Singer (Mets special assistant) and Kim Ng (Dodgers assistant general manager), according to the New York Times:   Singer -- "What are you doing here?"    Ng -- "I'm working."     Singer -- "What are you doing here?"     Ng -- "I'm working. I'm the Dodger assistant general manager."    Singer -- "Where are you from?"     Ng -- "I was born in Indiana and grew up in New York."     Singer -- "Where are you from?"     Ng -- "My family's from China."     Singer -- Nonsensically mock Chinese, then "What country in China?"   Dude! That is sooo right out of second grade. People need to grow up. Besides, is Bill Singer gay or what? (Personally, I think the entire Mets organization is gay, but that's another topic altogether...) Kim Ng is a 31 year old chick who's assistant GM of the Dodgers. When she was 29, she was assistant GM of the Yankees. That chick sounds like a winner. If I ever met her, I'd be busy trying to hitch my wagon to her star instead of making fun of her.  Kim Ng, if you're reading this: email me or link up on Friendster, yo!

        A Decade of Deviance...10 years of Hard Ons      There's a new  No Doubt  CD coming out, well a compilation of their hits actually, The Singles, 1992-2003  and its been 10 years of me wanting to bang Gwen Stefani! The compilation has all those songs you pretend you don't like but can't get out of your head and includes a new track, well a cover of  It's my Life , a  Talk Talk  song from the early 80s that even a 9 year old X-Tian could not get out of his gigantic head. I visualize myself wearing karate shoes for no reason and a preposterously tight shirt singing along. Then I started thinking back on the decade and got back to the first time I realized Gwen was like the hottest chick ever! It was the  Don't Speak  video. Granted it was not their first video, but it was the first time i was like "damn, i wanna bang this chick" I was living with Weber on Riverside drive and it was the first time in my life I had cable. DAMN! This continued on till I read somewhere that she and Gavin Rosedale liked having sex to my favorite  At The Drive In  CD,  Relationship of Command . After that, my love only grew stronger! And now even at the age of 34, I swear to god, I think she looks even better.

        Annecdotal Evidence   Messr. Evil is speaking entirely from second sources on this whole B School Busines. But as someone who is living it, I must agree wholeheartedly. In Haasweek (home of the Hustle, published weekly!) at the beginning of the year there were over 2 pages full of wedding photos. Everyone in site with a rack to speak of was getting married. Now Haas, is an interesting scenario because there are not a lot of women here, but the women in general lean towards the attractive (well, far more so than Columbia Engineering did, with the possible of exception fo sexpot Janice...and maybe the short friend, on a very good day)  The one thing that blows you away though, is the first week, you're walking around eager to make a pitch, and bam! you get poked in the eye with an engagement ring. Some of these things are so big, I expect Chad Pennington himself, to line up, take the snap and throw these things 15 yds. Its all about insecurity. Its like the dude is sitting there playing his playstion one day peaks up and realizes his GF is leafing through B School apps. One thought races through the mind.  "Holy Sh*t, this girl could meet and marry a banker at any moment!"  Next thing you know, the dude is overcompensating for his penis size with an engagement ring! Ladies, if you are at the point where its "shit or get off the pot" time with you man, just request some b school apps from Kellogg, Columbia and Wharton (and of course Haas...GO BEARS!) and just leave them around. Quickest way to close the deal I ever heard of.  Of course, if the lady does accept your work doesn't end there. My friend just started school and I dunno what her man is waiting on, but he has not produced the ring yet. Something about "the moment" or some crap. Dude, hurry up, there's a line forming yo! I mean sh*t I'm running around here hitting on everything in site, engaged chicks, single chicks, lesbians...(so sad)  On the ROI issue, its a good question, at least these Google chicks are going to generate some cash. Sounds great. These B School chicks are just racking up debt...debt and potential suitors for when you screw up. It's a loose loose situation. Fellas, think twice!

        Evil   IPO FEVER  I've been at my new job for three weeks now and one thing is clear: IPO Fever is in the air. Now, all this IPO talk is pure speculation (and sooo 1999 at that), but a lot of people are really into it. Specifically, the boyfriends of females in the company.  Since I started work there, I've noticed a rash of marriage proposals. Every Monday, multiple chicks come in to the office wearing huge rings and bigger smiles. Clearly, their boyfriends are locking them up before the big IPO.  I guess it's like buying options on a stock. You don't actually own the stock (that would be marriage), but you own the option to buy. I think the boyfriends are making a smart play here, for several reasons:  For one thing, once a chick knows she's getting married, she starts working out like a maniac. Gotta look stunning in that wedding dress right? If you ask me, that's just an excuse for being vain. But hey, what man doesn't want his girl to lose a little chub off her thighs?  Secondly, the engagement ties her up until IPO time. If the IPO goes well, then marriage is obvious. If the IPO bombs, then... no commitments right? Isn't that what engagement is all about? Seeing if things will work out BEFORE getting married?  This situation in general also reminds me of dudes who propose to their girlfriends who are about to enter bschool. I mean, because everyone knows that bschool is a sausage factory and any girl who is unattached going in will surely have sausages waving at her face. I'd just like to point out that while the pre-IPO proposal is a good play, the pre-bschool proposal is risky at best. It's not like buying options. It's more like a venture capital investment. That stuff is so early stage, it's really hard to predict how things are going to turn out.  But more importantly, remember the "capital" in venture capital. While your girl is back in school, guess who's paying for her Louis Vuitton handbag and other junk of the next two years? Yes, you! The VC game isn't for everyone, kiddies. How many John Doerr's are out there?  By the way, if there are any chicks out there reading this, I'm sure you've noticed that I'm quite the sensitive and caring guy. And oh, I'm pre-IPO!!! Drop me and email and a picture. You don't have to be naked in the picture, but it's preferable because if you're not, I'm just going to assume that you have bad stretch marks.

        Here is an excerpt from next week's edition of the Hustle (appearing weekly in HaasWeek)   You know it’s bad when you can’t see.   Here I was sitting in this air-conditioned cab wondering where exactly this cab driver was taking me, becoming more and more convinced that he was more interested in taking me on a tour of Ft Lauderdale rather getting me back to my hotel in a timely fashion.  My excuse is the drinking. Somewhere between being sober and being drunk I’m just paranoid. As he sits there telling me stories about Nigeria and driving at his own pace, my mind is racing. Trying to figure out if I had seen any of this strip the night before or if I was anywhere near my hotel. At one point he slows down looking for my hotel in an area that I KNOW is not my hotel. That’s it. Party over.  “Let me out here”  “Sir, its no safe here”  “Shut up, pull over and let me out. You don’t know where I’m even going.”  “Sir I go to the address I gave you…”  This goes on for another block; I shove some bills at him and tell him to [expletive] off. This goes on back and forth for a minute as I get out of the car. The second I do the humidity in the air causes condensation to form on my glasses and they mist up something awful.    Like I said, you know it’s bad when you can’t see.   Anyway, now I am just pissed off and he drives away I drive home the meaning of my hand gestures with a series of disparaging comments about the Nigerian National futbol team.   As I wipe my glasses I evaluate the situation, I have no idea where I am and start walking. I dial 411 and narrow down what hotel I am staying at and get some directions. Apparently, the cab driver did sort of know where he was going, I just have 10 more blocks to go. En route, I interrupt a drug bust to ask the police officer if I am heading the right way.   I survey the detainee and ask him if he’s Haitian, the cop seems more than a little bothered by the fact that some possibly drunk dude who has managed to sweat straight through a wool suit is interrupting his bust. I tell the cat to “stay strong” and bop off towards to my hotel.    To read more, Please visit my  urlLink site  after Friday.

        Evil   Today, I spent two solid hours sitting in on a conference call where people were throwing out issues left and right and nothing was getting done. It was the  best  two hours I've spent in a long time. Possibly, the best two hours ever! Let me explain...  I was in a conference room, the long-ass kind, where they put the long-ass table. You know, like a 20-foot table or something. The conference room has a row of windows that look out onto a skinny little hallway. The only reason why anyone would be in the skinny hallway is to get to the women's bathroom. During the entire conference call, I was looking into the hallway, but I couldn't see everything... because the window shades were pulled half-way down to make the room dark for the projector. As a result, all I could see was a little 18-inch sliver that extends from a normal person's waist up to that person's shoulders.  Is this all coming together? I spent the entire two hour call watching an  endless parade of breasts  saunter past the window. Breasts and breasts only. No head. No legs. Just jugs. Some great ones at that.  Having seen all this, I now realize what a tool I was to spend the last 3+ years of my life in the telecom industry. I should have been in the advertising industry all along. What scenery. Damn.

        Evil  I saw on the news today that the unemployment rate dropped by 6% last month, which is pretty great news I think. The indicators are pointing toward an economic recovery. And even though I'm typically skeptical about these things, something happened last week to finally convince me.  I caught Sleave on IM and asked him is Falling Apart Index. Sleave reports that he's at 90. Then I caught X-TIAN, who reported that he's at a whopping 101 on the Index. Dude, X-TIAN is literally off the scale. I would have figured that living in a loser state like California (crazy Governor, out of control fires, the Oakland Raiders, etc.) would automatically knock 5 points off your FA Index, but apparently not. Pretty amazing stuff.  Then I thought about myself. As much as I like to claim that I'm falling apart, it's been a pretty good few weeks. For one thing, I'm part of the 6% who no longer wake up at noon and spend the day scratching our collective balls. That was fun the first 3 or 4 months, but you can only scratch so much before developing some bruising. Really. Take my word for it.  The other thing is that I actually managed to do that marathon thing last week. I don't really know why I decided to do it in the first place. I mean, I'm the type of person who won't get off the couch to pick up the remote control if I've knocked it to the floor. Instead, I'll try to change the channels with my toes. I've gotten decently good at it, actually. But anyway, now that the marathon is done with, I can do things that I enjoy, like resume my alcoholism. Boy, I really miss sitting on my living room floor on a Saturday night and popping open cans and cans of Natty Lights. Strictly a class operation.  So if you're watching Moneyline with Lou Dobbs and he throws a bunch of economic indicators your way, take all that stuff with a grain of salt. If you really want to know where the economy is headed, ask Sleave, X-TIAN, and me for the current FA Index measurements. (For the record, I am at 85.)

Evil: Big f'ing deal. Those guys don't need to do any work on the downhill. They get half the race for free! Frog: I'm sure they'd trade that in for the use of their legs. Evil: Oh.

        Evil   A TALE OF TWO FATTIES (PART 1)  My two youngest cousins are 9 and 12. Conveniently, the 9 year old weighs 90 pounds and the 12 year old weighs 120 pounds. Also conveniently, we (the older cousins) refer to them as the Fatty Brothers. The nickname started of course as a joke, but it kind of stuck and sometimes the meanness of it makes me feel bad. I first realized this when the older kid started to understand the meaning of Fatty Brothers and every time we used that term, he would protest:  "Don't. call."  At this point, he would need to pause and catch his breath.  "Me. That!"  But relatively speaking, being one half of the Fatty Brothers is still much better than his original nickname, the one we gave him before his younger brother popped onto the scene. See, the older one didn't start speaking until very late. He didn't even have the ability to babble, like most kids do before they learn how to form words. Instead, he just grunted. He would sit at the table and grunt to his dad and his dad would give him more food (more food!). He would run to his mom and grunt and his mom would give him and hug and say softly, "Aww, are they picking on you again?"  So naturally, we called him Grunty.  My sister hypothesized that Grunty might be retarded. At one point she even set a firm deadline, saying "If that kid doesn't start speaking within 6 months, I'd bet anything that he's retarded." I almost took her up on that bet just because betting on whether a family member is retarded is really damn funny.  (To be continued...)

        Evil   SEASON OF GIVING  I met some friends for drinks last week and one of them told me a pretty interesting thing: when you donate blood, they can put that stuff on the shelf for up to 6 weeks, but platelets are only good for 5 days... so around the holidays, platelets are in seriously short supply everywhere because people rarely think about this stuff while in the midst of holiday shopping.  Since I live only a few blocks from Memorial Sloan Kettering (and seemingly, a dozen other hospitals as well), I dropped by to donate platelets after work on Dec 23rd. I've given blood before, but apparently, donating platelets is a whole other monster. I stepped into MSK feeling pretty jazzed about doing a good thing but things started heading downhill, and fast...  They made me sign all sorts of disclaimers. I easily waived my right to sue in the event of death (who ever heard of a dead man suing anyone?), but when I read the part about "the procedure may cause bruising..." I seriously thought about bailing. But I didn't. Toughness in action right there, boys.  Then came the medical history forms. Like I said, I've donated blood in the past, so I knew there would be a checkbox that asks "Since 1977, have you had sex with a man?" And this question always makes me chuckle: "Have you ever had sex with anyone with jaundice or anyone who appeared jaundiced." HAH. I don't know why that's funny, but it is. The thing I didn't expect is that in this hospital, you fill out some of the answers in a form, but for the morally-probing questions, they ask you face to face! So I sat in front of this lady as she ran me through a battery of moral challenges:  "Have you ever paid for sex?" "Have you ever had sex with someone who has paid for sex?" "Have you ever been paid for sex?" "Have you ever punched someone in the stomach while soliciting sex?" "Have you ever had unprotected sex with a drug user?" "Have you ever punched someone in the stomach while buying drugs?"  There were others, but you get the point. At the end of it all --because apparently they get lots of liars-- the lady hands me two stickers with bar codes printed on them. She shows me that one sticker means "Use my blood" and the other one means "Throw away my blood." And then she turns away so I can choose the appropriate sticker to put on my answer sheet.  Isn't that somewhat extreme? Oh well, whatever.  Then comes the actual donating of platelets. Whereas donating blood is a 15 minute deal involving one needle, donating platelets is a 90 minute ordeal involving one needle in each arm. Basically, they take blood out of one arm, spin it around to extract the platelets, and feed the remaining blood back into the other arm. I say it's an ordeal not because one extra needle makes a huge difference, but have you ever had to sit perfectly still for 90 minutes? About 2 minutes into the procedure I was already in trouble. I had an itch above my right eyebrow. Fuck.  I moved my right arm to see if scratching would be feasible but I quickly realized that the needle was jabbing me in quite the wrong way when I bent my arm.  It's weird having an itch and not being able to scratch it because it doesn't go away. In fact, it jumped around my face and even multiplied so before long, I had itches on my chin, under my collar, on the tip of my nose, basically everywhere.  I'm still not entirely sure how I managed to get through the whole 90 minutes, but lemme tell you, the instant that the nurse pulled out the first needle from my elbow, I scratched my face so vigorously that I basically clawed my face into pieces. The nurse was horrified. It was almost worth the whole experience to see her face.  Luckily, the nurse quickly grabbed my arm because had broken any skin, I surely would have bled to death seeing as I had just donated all of my platelets. Hah. How ironic would that have been.  Anyway, that was that. I'm not sure this post had a point. But whatever...

       HITTING THE WALL  For once, I write about hitting the wall and it's not me doing the hitting. Maybe that's a good sign for the upcoming year. Actually, since you've all been good boys and girls this year (HAH!), I have TWO hitting the wall stories to share...   One . On Thursday night, we had our company holiday party. It was great... open bar, the whole thing. You know. The only downside is that people had to come in to work the next day and as you'd expect, everyone was hurting to various degrees. I think the prize for Most Hurting went to this girl...  Girl: You don't know how much I'm hurting today.  Me: Well, we're all hurting.  Girl: No, you don't understand. Have you ever had to take a nap in the shower?  Me: Umm, no.  Girl: I was showering this morning and I realized that I just couldn't get through it. I went and napped in the shower.  Me: Wait. You were lying down in the shower?  Girl: Yeah.  That was great. I was picturing her naked and passed out in the shower. Hot.   Two . On Saturday morning I ran a race in Central Park. It was the "Holiday Run For Kids 4-Miler." I'm not sure what the For Kids element was all about, but there certainly were lots of kids entered in the race.  Shortly after the race started, I ran past a kid and someone who was probably his dad. The kid stopped his stride, threw his hands in the air and then slapped them down on his sides. Then he huffed in exasperation, "A mile is a long way!"  To which his dad responded, "You're not even at a mile yet! C'mon let's go!!!"  That's some tough love right there, but I think his dad did the right thing. Kids need to learn what toughness is all about.

        Evil   CLEARING THE AIR  On Saturday night, I ran out to Bed Bath & Beyond and bought an air purifier. I'm not sure why I had the sudden urge to purify the air around me, but the feeling hit me and it hit me hard. As such, I bought one of those heavy duty HEPA filters. Good stuff.  I was reading the instruction manual and noticed a couple of interesting points:  1. "The HEPA filter removes virtually all airborne particles passing through it." More specifically, it filters out 99.97% of all particles, down to 0.03 microns.  2. "The HEPA filter should be changed every 12 months."  Points 1 and 2 combined has me thinking: When I go to change that filter 12 months from now, HOW SKANKY IS IT GOING TO BE? I mean, that thing will have trapped all sorts of pollen, dirt, house dust, comet dust, dust mites, bed mites, boogers, flu viruses, HIV, airborn cum and dried fecal matter in it over the course of a full year. Will I die instantly once I touch it? I am afraid.

       I spent thursday, friday and saturday in close proximty to a number of people of had the "flu". I never stood a chance.  That's my problem with these people. They just don't know how to be sick. When you're sick. Do the following   (1) Close all your windows and put up heavy blinds. In a pinch, feel free to use heavy blankets (2) Put on ill fitting sweat pants. Not like wind pants or anything you would wear out to a book store. Sweatpants, the sort of thing that you would put on if you wanted to fit in at wal-mart (3) lay in bed, all day, with nothing more than a few bottles of water, some boxes of tissues and buckets...many buckets.  What you should not do, is  (1) show up to a group meetings and liberally handle all sorts of calculators, laptops and writing instruments that your classmates might be using. (2) Do not, show up a party, get ripped and liberally sniffle in front of everyone you talk to (3) Basically, please just stay away from me.  I am going to go lie down somewhere in the dark....

        Things Said to me on Saturday Evening when the worlds collided and EVIL met some of my school friends   (1) "so let me get this straight, none of you are in a relationship. Neither of you are trying to hook up with her? That settles it you and [Evil] are both clearly gay" - my cool, female married friend. (2) "That's personal and inappropriate." - My friend's wife (3) "where are all the single women at?" -EVIL (4) "He's not even vietnamese is he?" - A short vietnamese classmate that EVIL tried to put the move on. I defended him with "He's actually half vietnamese/half Puerto Rican. Jackson Heights Baby" (5) "did your friend just say he's getting off on the boob rubs as he walks around...ill" (6) "you can't dance" to which i replied "i'm just drunk"  Here's an exchange EVIL and I had  Me: Gotta admit pretty funny EVIL: ONly you would think that's funny. That's not funny at all. ME (not said but thought): I could crush your windpipe right now. That would be funny, you Knee Cutting Bastard   I was pretty ripped towards the end of the evening. Apparently, I thought better of it and bagged the afterparty I idea and jumped in a car going to the East Bay. I did not realize this until we were well over the bridge. When I was asked what exit to take to where I lived I realized that a Trinidadian dude was passed out on my shoulder and the creepy classmate with an asian fixation (CCWAF) were also in the car. The car btw, belonged to my vietnamese classmate, who i had spent the better part of 2 hours positioning EVIL to hit off. I wondered aloud "what am i doing in this car? who are you people?"   When I got home my roommate was asleep on the couch. I woke his ass up and we continued drinking. He was discussing some problem he had with a significant other. I encouraged him repeatedly (occasionally with shoves towards the door) that it was a problem that needed to be resolved right that second, by driving to South Bay at 4am (while drunk)!!!  Later I passed out on the rug.    Proof that EVIL is in fact evil...  EVIL"are you going to try to stab you cool married, friend's husband in the back? I think you are" X-Tian "that thought had not even crossed my mind. What's wrong with you?" EVIL"oh...um...nothing...hahaha"

        Evil   The snow storm kept me from getting back to New York this weekend, which was great because I stayed in the Bay Area an extra day and got to hang with X-TIAN at a party in SoMa. The party was in a packed lounge and it took all of 30 seconds for X-TIAN and EVIL to revive our two-man pickup routine from the mid-to-late 90's. Our act is not like The Eagles or The Rolling Stones, where the material stands up to the test of time. Come to think of it, I'm not sure that we got much success (err, ANY success) of out the act during its orginal run, but hey. I think we're much more like Whitesnake because as Saturday night proved yet again, when the team of X-TIAN and EVIL work a bar scene, things are sure to go down in flames.  The night's festivities started with me driving from South Bay up to the city. In amazing defiance of the odds, there were three accidents on US-101 between Mountain View and San Francisco and none of them involved ME! Bay area people are SO not tough, it's embarrassing. Granted, a torrential downpour left the roads wet and obsured some visibility, but bay area people just freak out and start crashing into medians. Crazy stuff. Being the tough Northeasterner that I am, I cruised up to the city unscathed, ready for an evening of partying or clownery, whichever came first.  I bop in to the lounge with my tall Chinese friend in tow. I have this theory that being seen with a spectacularly tall Chinese girl will bring me more cred when I work the scene, but somehow that hasn't panned out. We grab drinks and go look for a Giant Head in the crowd. That takes only a few seconds.  X-TIAN and I break into some banter that involves making fun of these two blonde girls who are right behind us. They get up and leave and throw disgusted glances in our direction. That's the old magic working right there. We haven't lost a thing, lemme tell you.  Basically, repeat the part about grabbing drinks and receiving disgusted looks and that pretty much sums up the evening. A good time was had by all!  By the way, I should mention that I almost got a bit of the ol' Sex that evening. Yes, it's true. The place was so packed that were it not for the fact that I was wearing pants, I'm pretty sure I would have scored. Sure, it would have been Sex via Incidental Contact, but hey, no one needs to get all technical on me. I did get rubbed by boobage from a dozen different girls, so that was cool too. Yes, I have the mentality of an 8th grader.  All in all, this makes me think that we should bring Team Rachel back together for the traditional President's Day weekend in Vegas. ("Traditional" meaning that we did it once and X-TIAN wasn't even there. HAH.) This time though, being older and wiser and because Mr. Shoulders and Kentaro make more money than they know what to do with, we will raise the stakes. I am proposing that we get our hands on some cocaine and hire a hooker so that Mr. Shoulders can re-enact the infamous scene from  Gia  where a coked-up hooker get punched in the stomach while trying to score her next fix. That's classic stuff. Real classic stuff.

        Evil   FIGHTING THE WRONG FIGHTS  I have a bruise on my head. My left ribs are sore. I am fighting the wrong fights.  The car door did it to me. You see, I am in California this week and the lady at the car rental place gave me a brand new car. It's a less than dynamic Chevy Cavalier with all of 6 miles on it. The engine isn't quite broken in so the ride is not great, but I sort of expected that. What I didn't expect was that the doors would have super f'ing strong springy hinges. Or that each door weighs 67 pounds. Combine those two things and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out I've been getting battered by a car door all week long. (For all you rocket scientists in the audience: we're talking a force of 1.69 x 10^9 Newtons. Yes, that's some serious shit.) This is what happens every time I try to get out of the car:  1. Evil shuts off car engine and swings door open. 2. Evil moves body (160 pounds) toward outside of car. 3. Car door (67 pounds) swings out and springs back in with amazing force. 4. Freak collision.  This is bad. I'm going to go cry now. Bye.

        The Simple Life   Couple of points I came up with: (1) Pretty, rich girls are pretty boring (2) Ugly, rich girls are mind numbingly so (3) Hicks, being poor, probably under-educated, and probably beaten by life, are just not funny (4) Just because you go to Regis, doesn't mean you're smart. Evil, who went to Stuy, has probably believed this for quite some time. (5) Paris like Jessica Simpson before her, is pretty dumb, but unlike JS, she is someone that's really easy to hate. (6) Paris is really pretty but has an unattractive ass, because its so flat. She has a pretty face but man her legs are like bow-legged  I am thru watching until someone double teams a farm hand or a farm animal!

        Evil   THANKSGIVING AND MY FAMILY (Part 2 of 2)  Over dinner, my dad and I had somewhat of an awkward conversation. Not that we were discussing an uncomfortable topic or anything… it's just that all our conversations are awkward. We are not a socially graceful crew. This reminds me of the time that I saw my dad hold his grandson (my nephew) for the first time. He looked so awkward that I thought to myself, "That man has never held a baby before." But then I realized that he had 3 kids himself and must have held at least one of us at least once, right?  When we do talk, my dad often surprises me with how much he actually knows or how utterly stupid he is. It's weird. There's usually no middle ground. He was at both ends of the spectrum over Thanksgiving dinner. It went something like this:  Dad: So how's your new job going?  Evil: It's good. Beats my last job by a lot.  Dad: What do you do there?  Evil: You know, sales.  Dad: You're selling advertising now?  Mind you, I work at a search engine company. I bet at least 99% of the people who have heard of it know it as a search engine company. Frankly, before I started working there, I hardly had a clue how they were making money. But for some reason, it appears that my dad is familiar with the company's business model. Crazy! Anyway, the conversation continues like this…  Evil: Well no. I don't personally sell anything. I work on sales strategy in general.  Dad: I see. Have you ever thought of getting a federal job?  Evil: What?  Dad: You know, work for the government. They're always looking for people to do networking or programming or whatever.  Now, what's this crap all about? I have a cushy sales strategy job at pre-IPO search engine company that's so hot it receives over 1000 resumes a day and my dad is suggesting that I try to get job coding HTML for the Housing and Urban Development website or something. As if we were still living in Confucian times (that's 500 BC to you westerners) and the most noble occupation in all of The Middle Kingdom is to serve as an official of the state.  All in all though, I'm glad I had Thanksgiving with family this year. In previous years, I've gone around telling people that I'm an orphan and guilt-tripping them into inviting me over for Thanksgiving dinner. Boy, I gotta say, those meals were great. But someone once told me, "You jackass, Thanksgiving is for family," He was right of course. Even though I had to spend time with my crazy uncles and my brilliant / retarded dad, I was glad I did it.

        Evil   You know how sometimes you're drunk and you'll say a bunch of stuff that you don't really mean? Or you'll email someone a bunch of stuff and in the morning wish you hadn't? Well, I had that type of moment the other night. I hopped on Friendster and wrote a drunked Testimonial for our old friend, Columbia. You can check it out on the site, of you can just read below, you lazy ass.   Well well well, Columbia. Funny that we should  run into each other here. You look good.  Really, you do. It's been what, over 5 years  now. Is that right? Wow, it's been that long.  Hey, I couldn't help but notice that you're now  #11 on U.S. News and World report for  undergraduate universities. What ranking were  you when we met, Columbia? Number 7 or 8  and headed for Top 5, wasn't that right?  Anyway, who pays attention to those rankings?  I still remember you fondly, Columbia... Like  the night that I explored your tunnels for the  first time. Wow, I was really drunk that night,  but I recall that you not only took me, but 4 of  my friends as well. I learned a lot when we  were together. You know that. You know you  made me a better person. You know that,  right? Columbia, OK, I'll won't beat around the  bush. I'll just say it: I want us to be together  again. Think about that. How great would that  be? Take me back, Columbia. Take me back  for business school. Think about two more  years together. It'll be like old times again,  except that we'll both be a little smarter and  wiser. I have more money now! More for you  to take! C'mon, what do you say? Call me,  Columbia. Better yet, send me a big, thick  envelope and include all the details of our  rekindled relationship. Write me soon!

Man, am I caught up in some campaign fever. 10 days ago, sitting in my house -drunk and high- I prediced that Jon Edwards the was the man to watch. If he places 3rd in NH and wins SC its a downhill sprint for him. How great...Candidate Dean is increasingly disturbing and scary, and Kerry seems to always look like he died 14 days ago. Its sort of like  Weekend at Bernie's  with that guy. How odd.  Jay-Z sipping champagne, courtside at a Net's game in three years in Brooklyn, who'd have thought it...crazy

        OUTDATED MOVIE REVIEW    Lord of the G-String: The Femaleship of the G-Strings   It falls into that bad niche of soft-core porn where the sex doesn't involve much sex but the story is still close to non-existant. If the sex scenes had been hotter, or a lot shorter, the movie would have been suddenly and dramatically improved. As it was, the male-female sex scenes weren't that bad; the intercourse was obviously simulated, but they still looked like they were enjoying themselves. The girl-girl (or in most cases girl-girl-girl-girl-and more girls) scenes were what really detracted from it. The kissing wasn't realistic. There was a lot of nipple licking, but the kind that looks good for the camera but might not actually be touching the nipple. There was a lot of boob grabbing. A lot of it. There was also a fair amount of simulated cunnilingus. Very obviously simulated cunnilingus. Is there some rule about cunnilingus in soft-core porn that says you have to be able to tell they're faking it? Or maybe it wasn't fake cunnilingus, maybe all of the female stars just had that unusual condition where their clit is located in their navel or upper thigh. I was also really perplexed by why they kept undulating at each other and rubbing their breasts on each others' backs. Bottom line: Even if they weren't going to show any genitals, there are thousands of ways to fake genital contact better than they did. If lots and lots of boob grabbing does it for you, this is your movie.  As for the story, it was a pretty good spoof. There were LotR references aplenty and it followed a similar plotline. The writing was...not stellar, but not painful either. Some of the humor was really juvenile, but for the most part the story was solid. The problem was that the story wasn't really supported by the actors. The acting was better than most porn I've seen, but not good enough for a bad B movie. The part that made this really sad was that you could tell from some parts of the movie and the "making of" interviews that most of the actors could have done a lot better. Some scenes had pretty decent acting. The same girl would bomb the next scene. Its not that they don't have the talent, it's that they weren't pushed to do a good job or just didn't get enough takes. The poor acting was especially apparent in the fight scenes. They had a combat coach, they were doing all the moves, bu they looked really bored. My theory, based on all of the discussion in the "making of" about how much they spent to shoot it on film, is that they couldn't afford more than one or two takes of most scenes. A pity.  The special effects... Oh dear but the special effects were funny. I can't decide if I was entertained enough by their poor quality that I'm glad they put them in or if they should just have left them out. The most entertaining part was the computer generated 3-D map of the Shire. It showed a 1st person view of you zooming through it to let you know where the next scene was set. The graphics were on par with a cheap 1996 computer game. It would have been MUCH more aesthetically pleasing to have just panned along a well-drawn map.  The good parts. Misty Mundae (the leading lady who plays Dildo Saggins) is kind of pretty. Everyone else in the cast that gets naked is really attractive too. There is one really unfortunate boob job, but otherwise the cast is just amazing to look at. Yum. If Misty Mundae has been in any more hard-core stuff, I want to see it. The trailers for her other movies, and her website, show that she has been in a truly amazing amount of porn since her 18th birthday, much of it kinky. So, I am in luck.  Overall, I was amused, but the movie doesn't really cut it as porn, and doesn't really cut it as a movie. If they'd improved one or both facets by a little they could've really had something.   SUPER BOWL   Patriots vs. Panthers....GO PANTHERS!!!!! WOOOOOO!!!!!  I refuse to support anything the least remotely associated with Boston....freaking losers!!!

A writer movng to Paris is SO 1922. Honestly, I don't know that I approve of the impact the show has had, I am pretty sure the Marina section of SF is entirely the fault of  SATC  and for that alone someone should be punished. Besides, is it really appropriate for 40 year old women to go out on a friday night, get drunk and shout about penis all night? I don't think so.   But really, the show captured a moment in time really well. I never watched the show until I moved in with Manolo in late 2000 and became hooked. I could never admit it, because i spent the whole half hour mocking Manolo and Mr. NonCommital for watching this "show for old chicks who haven't gripped reality", but really I was really digging it.  Carrie would go on a date to Bungalow 8, I was just at Bungalow 8 the week before. They'd be at Sushi Samba, I would have just been there. It was all very dot.com era, all very posh, all very "how great is this new scrubbed down, ritz NY". I was there, I saw, I knew.   But that moment passed, jsut like my time in NYC passed, I was done there and the show was done for me. Still I'm glad it ended, and I think it ended the right way, Carrie and Big (why was he called big anyway? because of his member? or his wallet? I hope to one day earn the name Big, i'll take either reason). Its all very Tracy and Hepburn....  Besides, Chris Noth rocks....I've been drunk enough to get tossed from  the Cutting Room , and I didn't.

        Evil   'ROIDED UP!  I have to know, man, who in baseball is 'roided up and who isn't? It's like when I was a kid and someone broke the lamp in the living room. My mom just wanted to know who the heck broke the lamp: me, my no good little brother, or my snotty big sister. My mom wouldn't have gotten mad or anything. She just wanted to know, you know? (Or at least that's what she said. Moral of the story: never trust my mom. I owned up to breaking the lamp and that woman beat me within an inch of my life. You think The Passion of The Christ has some violent scenes, you should have seen my childhood. But I digress...)  Back to baseball... I'll admit that take steroids doesn't do anything for increasing bat speed or foot speed. I don't really know why baseball players would do it, seeing as it makes your pee pee smaller, gives you acne, and makes your head bigger. WHO WANTS A BIG HEAD??? But you have to admit though: Barry Bonds does look pretty suspicious these days:

        Evil   I GOT A HUG TODAY  It was weird. I'm not used to getting hugs in a professional environment. Yes, the hug happened at work. And luckily, it wasn't from a dude. That would have been really weird. As it is, it's just sort of weird. I liked it tho. The girl who hugged me is a 24 year old sex pot. I sometimes try to avoid her on purpose because I'm afraid if I talk to her, I will somehow oogle her too blatantly and then get fired.  I should have more to write about, but I might have caught X-TIAN's case of the blues. Screw you, Big Head! I'm off to mope around now. If you happen to see my parents, please do me a favor and remind them that they didn't hug me enough when I was a kid. (I stole that line from X-TIAN. HAHAHA.)

Dude, the saddest part about  Angel  getting cancelled its clearly getting better with time, last night's episode where Angel was pure hilarity as Angel and co. fight off a bunch of demons who take over a children's show with some interesting results.   I like Joss Whedon ( Buffy ,  Firefly ) well enough but Bend Edlund ( The Tick !!!) is a friggin genius  SPOOOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Can someone put the O.C. up on BitTorrent please? I can't seem to find it.

          I feel as if the world is moving about a half step faster than i can deal with today. Its very wierd.  I noticed that I have been relying heavily on caffine the other day. On any given day, I pound the following:  16oz cup of coffee (830am) 1 can Diet Coke (11am) 1 can Diet Coke (with lunch) 1 can Diet Coke (3 pm)  and then somehow end up needing a nap from 5-6pm. Its a bit extreme. So I decided to cut out caffine today to see how I could do without it.   I sat down in class and basically wanted to cry. People seemed to be shouting al around me, "....dinner plans" "chris....ugly"  "hit tennis balls....court" none of it was making any sense. It was all i could do to not get under the table and ball up.  During class was no better, I basically sat there like a sad sack examining both the  urlLink Sleave/Rina  blog and  urlLink Web's  Blog. Outstanding blogs thru and thru, that make me insanely jealous. How do these freaks put all this time into their blogs, it took me 3 months to resurrect  urlLink comments  after my initial comment provider went out of business.  Anyway, in between classes I ran off and got some coffee. but this is not the right way to be. I need a new plan...   Any thoughts on how I should deal with this?

       Adding Insult to Injury  So today is rough on a couple of levels. (1) The Yanks have A-Rod, I can't say its wrong because whatever, its not really wrong, just mildly depressing. The only thing that will make it ok is if A-Rod and Jeter get in a slap fight in the club house over a woman. That's how it all ended for the Kidd, Jackson, Mashburn Mavs I believe  (2) The WB cancelled Angel! The hell?! It was going so good this season, I like the show about the vampire with a soul. Really dark stuff sometimes...and good over alll.   Find out what you can do here:   urlLink http://www.renewangel.com/

        Evil   WOOOOOO!  Don't have to work today, so I'm listening to Mike and the Dog on the radio. The show is pretty much a 5-hour ARod-fest. Wooooo! Pumped up!  Actually, the Dog is on vacation but fat Mike Francesca really brought his "A" game today. During one of the commercials, they were playing this pre-recorded jingle promoting a Mets call-in contest. Basically, be the 13th caller and win 2 tickets to some random Mets game. Fat Mike cuts in during the middle of the jingle and goes, "What? Are the Mets nuts!? Does anyone care about the Mets today?" Hahahaha. Good one.  To add insult to injury, fat Mike yells over to his producer and asks, "Are we even gonna get 13 callers for this content?"  Poor Mr. Met. Not only is he gay, but his team sucks to boot.

        Evil   MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS  This is not good. I know I've been losing muscle tone for a while now. Never really thought much of it because I am cuter when I'm chubby, so hey, no sweat. But recently I've also noticed that my tough is getting bigger... or rather, it's getting more swollen. It's at the point now where my tongue gets in the way of my teeth. I guessing that in a week it will start to protrude out of my mouth and I'll become all drooly.  I started to worry, so I hopped on WebMD tonite. Like I said... this is not good. Lost muscle tone. Big tongue. I think I'm getting  urlLink Down Syndrome . I'm not sure how to break this to my parents.

Is she sporting a bunch of zits right now or is someone asleep at the wheel in the booth?  John Mayer and  "From the Whole Ten Yards"  Matthew Perry, is that a joke about  Friends  being over?  Beck has a serious trouble with his microphone and says something like  "ladies and gentleman, Jesus and Children of America...The White Stripes"  Jack White has his guitar tuned wierd and there is a timing issue between something and something else...fire someone please? Meg looks hot...really hot...plastic surgery?  Joe Perry made a deal with the devil when? Is he Dorian Grey? Is Steven his portrait? They and BB King present the rap grammy for my benefit. Juxtaposition amuses me. Outkast is lost somewhere and the camera does not know where to cut to...hahah...only dre comes up...where's big boi? did he refuse to come up because they only shouted out the Love Below?

Beyonce comes out, looking tired and worn and thanks all 20 peole involved in writing her album  We cut to Ellen Degeneres who does a stuttering Woody Allen thing, not funny...  She cuts to a Beatles tribute by Sting, Vince Gill, Dave Matthews and Pharrell????????  WHAT???   Luckily Pharrell and his weak voice play the part of Ringo. But is Sting then John, George?

Baseball is great, I love baseball right up until the first pitch. After that it's all down hill. There is no where to go, but down. You ate your hotdog, you got indigestion. You're mets fan, and somehow you are ten game out 4 games into the season. You're a yankee fan and with every loss you're worried about Jeter getting traded to the Orioles for a bag of peanuts and Brady Andersen. Somehow, 1 game into the season your fantasy team is 15th out of 16th. Its just not fair.   I mean has anyone sat in Yankee Stadium in mid July, Its hot and people are crazy! Who needs it, the sweat and the smell and the $6 dollar icey treats.  But you'll all be back next April....

        Evil   WEEKEND AT BIGHEAD'S  Traveling for work is sucky, but the one cool thing is staying the weekend in California. I was pumped for the weekend because baby, I had big plans. Unfortunately, my Well Profiled Friend cancelled her CA weekend trip sort of last minute. Oh well. I wasn't going to let that stop me from having a kick ass weekend tho. Enter Plan B. Unfortunately, my little PhD friend from Berkeley cancelled also because it's the start of spring break and she decided that she'd rather go camping in Joshua Tree than hang with me. No matter, because I am a dynamic person. Enter Plan C. Unfortunately, My Maniacally Overworked Friend (MMOW) cancelled because she's tied up with a new product launch. Damn. What now?  I had two choices for Plan D: sit in my hotel room and cry -or- hang with Big Head in the East Bay. It came down to a coin flip and the coin said to hang with Big Head, so hang with Big Head it was.  Clownery started on Friday night. First up: Golden State Warrors vs. Houston Rockets. The arena was nearly packed and 80% of the people were there for the visiting team. That's right: Charles Oakley in a Rockets uniform. (Mark Jackson too! Jeff Van Gundy and Patrick Ewing on the coaching staff!) Too bad Oak only played 20 seconds. 0 points, 0 boards, 0 assists, but a whole lot of toughness. You can't put toughness in the box score.  After the game, we went in search of food. Someone decided that Korean would be a good idea. After putting away 13 little appetizer dishes, 1 bi bim bop, 1 spicy chicken bbq, 1 bulgogi, and 1 fish and egg dish, all parties admitted to having an unhealthy relationship with food. We then proceeded to look for bubble tea as a dessert and actually found a place, but the asians in there gave us dirty stares so we blew outta there.  Back at Big Head's Oakland Hills estate, we watch Sportscenter and promptly pass out from either exhaustion, food guilt, or both.  Saturday morning: two guys stagger to the driving range. One guy is wearing a giant coffee stain on his shirt. The other guy is wearing a tshirt with cutoff sleeves and showing some big guns. The dude in the pro shop gives us a squinty stare. This is what happens when two ill-dressed dudes show up at a posh golf club. Whatever. I go to the ball machine and proceed to dispense 100 balls directly onto the ground. (Damn! Forgot the bucket!) Balls go bouncing and scattering everywhere. A guy with a stained shirt and another guy with a cutoff T are running around chasing golf balls. Everyone at the range turns and shoots glares of disgust. No one asks us to leave, which is a win in itself.  Back at the Estate, we watch School of Rock on DVD and I have an internal monologue about making a porn parody called School of Cock. It would involve young girls in private school uniforms. Now that's a winner!  Unfortunately, I had to leave Sunday afternoon and miss some grilling action at the Estate. Big Head apparently has a gay hanger-on who chills at the estate in exchange for certain services, like cooking and preparing a very involved marinade for grilled ribs.  I'm just going to trail off now and pretend that I actually wrote an ending....

        Happy St. Patrick's Day       The Phillie Phanatic celebrates the holiday, so you should too, because The Phillie Phanatic hangs out with the President of the United States and the Director of Homeland Security.        However, today The Phillie Phanatic is sad, much like Evil's clown friends, because Veterans Stadium, the only home The Phanatic has ever known, has only has 4 more days left on God's  green  Earth.    R.I.P. The Vet    I have many great memories at Veterans Stadium, including, but not limited to:     Monday Night Football circa 1997. Eagles vs 49ers. The Eagles were down something like 27-6 at halftime. I didn't even watch the second half of the game, there were about 15 brawls and a woman flashing from the luxury suites. With less than two minutes left in the game, someone shot a flare gun from one side of the stadium to the other, over the field, fortunately landing in an empty seat... It was after this game that they set up a court room and Judge Seamus McCaffrey in the basement.   2002 Playoff game. Eagles vs Falcons. The pregame party tent just outside The Vet hosted by the local sports radio station, 610 WIP. While the hosts were leading the crowd in a E-A-G-L-E-S EAGLES cheer, a group of 5 or 6 guys walk in with half-dead 30 lbs geese held above their heads chanting, " Kill the Falcons! ". These poor birds looked clubbed to death. Almost like animationics, because their limp bloodied bodies would show signs of life.   Circa 1999 regular season. Eagles vs Cowboys. In the same tent, people bring a coffin and an crude effigy Troy Aikman. Another psycho walks in with a chainsaw on. i left at that point.   The bathroom sinks being regularly used as urinals. (not me btw)   I left vacationing at the Jersey shore in 2001 to attend a Thursday night preseason game vs the Ravens. After driving the 90 minutes, paying for parking, settling in... the Ravens decide they can't play on the turf, and leave the stadium....... On a side note, it's because of this night that I'm estatic about the Ravens getting screwed by T.O. and the Eagles yesterday. f' em.   The whole stadium chanting in unison during pre-game introductions for the other team.... " Starting for the New York Giants... Wide Receiver, Amani Toomer... " SUCKS! " Running back, Tiki Barber... " SUCKS! " Quarterback, Kerry Collins...  SUCKS! ... never gets old... The visiting teams started combatting it by being introduced as a whole team, Patriots-Superbowl-2002-style.   Any fan entering the stands wearing the opposing teams' jersey gets the surrounding 5 or 6 sections pointing and chanting in unison, "Asssssss...hooolllllee...Asssssss...hooolllllee..."     Long live The Vet!

           I think Sleeve was going to proposition Beniot Benjamin in the same way!   Sopranos Recap   David Chase is challenging us. He's challenging us to continue watching  The Sopranos  and he redefines the notion of television pacing. Last night we were given hour two of his attempt to set up the entire season. A new character, Tony B was introduced and then played for comedy. There was about 20 minutes of dialogue. It was really frustrating.

        Outdated Book Review    The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay    by Michael Chabon    The author of Wonder Boys apparently took the world by storm six years ago with this prototypical great American novel. At the time I was too far into the grips of self loathing to notice or do anything about it. I remember reading a lot of Camus and lying down a lot. (SHOUT OUT TO EVIL)  Sam Klayman (later Clay) is laying in bed one night minding his own business, when his mother walks into the room shoves him aside in his own bed and introduces him to his cousin Joseph Kavalier, a trained escape artist who managed to escape the Nazis and get to New York. The two cousins quickly strike up a friendship and convince Sam's boss (a woopie cushion maker) to get into the comic book business. From this lush backdrop we get it all, a view into the jewish experience during the 1940s, the second world war, Gollems, the Kevaufner Hearings during the 1950s, repressed homosexuality and of course comic books (yah!). Sam and Joe leverage their marginal fame into meeting people from Orson Wells to Salvador Dali. Joe even manages to fall in love with a member of the Saks family before he leaves it all to enlist and fight in World War 2.   I managed to read the whole book on the flight to and from Atlanta in about 2 days. Check it out..

And he's only 14 months old! He's got a lifetime of emotional closed-offness, struggles with food, and emotional scarring ahead of him. You wanna get in on the ground floor here. This kid is gonna be a star. Attached is evidence that he meets the requirements:    "Emotionall closed off" : This is a pic of me and him hanging out. We literally keep each other at arm's lenght. Also notice the giant box of Veniero's in the foreground. I sat there and ate no less than 1 dozen mini canolis. (Hey, they were mini!)  I think some of that rubbed off on the kid. See next pic...        "Unhealthy relationship with food" : No futher commentary needed.        "Emotional scarring due to underloving parents" : This is a pic of new nephew and his dad. Apprently, in that household, a crying baby is not really a crying baby. Instead, a crying baby is an excellent shield against the paparazzi.

       So apparently the New Sopranos' poster is supposed to be an homage to  The Raft of the Medusa  a painting by Theodore Ge'ricault. The painting depicts the story of the Medusa a ship that ran into problems on the way to the Port of St. Louis in Senegal, apparently due to a slightly overbearing captain, continued to the point where certain crew members were throw overbored or chopped to bits, and ended with members of the crew on a raft, resorting to Cannibalism.       Crazy internet rumor? maybe...but you have to admit there is something to be said for the parrallels in the story.

       I went to vote today in the primary, more important than deciding who was more charismatic (Kerry vs. Edwards) I felt compelled to weigh in on the California (Kah-LEE-Four-NYA) budget crisis. The governor ( who i think is being incredibly aggressive trying to get things done, for good or bad, its hard to say) has been heavily supporting Prop 57-58 which are inexplicably tied together, the gist being, a bond to bail Kah-LEE-Four-NYA out of its budget crisis in the short term and basicaly refinance it all ( I am oversimplifying yes, so feel free to yell at me, but its late and whatever). I voted yes on these props but almost wanted a little dialogue box where I could suggest some alternatives or complain about my options.   Here's my deal:  I get the point that mortgaging future is not the way to go and how in the long run that does not help anyone. But gosh, why would I vote against this refinancing. If I do vote against it, its not like some politician is going to grow a backbone, make a tough choice and raise taxes. NO, they would never do that, there are re-election campaigns to run. This stuff is going to come out of necessary services which I generally think we don't have enough of.   I run around Lake Merritt sometimes and honestly, its the prettiest part of Oakland. Really nice, about 3 miles in perimeter. Unfortunately, one cannot run around there without being accosted by the some f*cked up homeless guy. My heart breaks for them, because they are clearly slow or demented or sometimes it seems both. I asked someone how all these guys congregate around the lake and what I was told was that some time ago, a mental hospital just kind of closed and let all these people go. Damn! I have no idea how true it is, regardless there is a problem. These people aren't being served, clearly no one is rounding them up and taking them somewhere to get help so clearly there is a service here that should be rendered.   Let's not even touch, schools. That's a whole other issue. Anyway, I don't know what the right answer is, but I felt like I was backed into voting for this thing.

        Evil   OUTDATED MOVIE REVIEW  Seems that  The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King  has been getting a lot of buzz lately. Well, I saw it, and if you haven't seen it yet... dont bother unless you have some sort of homo midget fetish. This movie should really be called The Gaylord of the Rings or something. Remember in the mid 1980's when kids used to run around and call each other "gaylord"? That was hilarious stuff. Why did that term fall out of favor? For that matter, why did terms like "doofus" and "dickweed" disappear from the popular venacular? Booooo...  Anyway, back to the movie... in this film, we follow our heros Frodo and Sam as they go on some sort of "journey" together. Sam is in love with Frodo, but Frodo is a heartless little bitch and all he cares about is the bling bling. To complicate matters, there is this weird love triangle involving a computer generated animation. I just don't get why Sam and Frodo bother so much with a CG character. Don't they know that he goes away once they power down the computers?  I sort of feel bad for Sam because he's the "loyal pal" who's not-so-secretly in love with his friend. At eight different times during this movie, I thought that Sam and Frodo were going to either tongue kiss or have a full-on bitch fight.  Parents be warned: there are sexually suggestive scenes in this movie and not really suitable for kids. In the cave scene, Frodo gets his ass kicked by a big spider and is left for dead. Sam, trusty as ever, comes along to save Frodo by peeling away the spider webs from his buddy and then undresses him altogether. Gay midget sex is one thing (some of my best friends are gay midgets!), but gay midget necrophelia is crossing the line!  My favorite scene is probably when Frodo comes back after dropping the ring in the volcano and he wakes up in a bed back in his home village. This scene makes deft use of porn lighting, you know, the soft white lighting effect. Frodo looks toward the door and Sam comes skipping in and jumps on the bed and the two hobbits hug and frollick. (It reminds me a little of X-TIAN and SCP from back in the old days, but that's neither here nor there.)  To be honest, I don't remember 90% of the movie because it was so ass long. At one point, I lost circulation in my butt cheeks and didn't know what to do with myself.  Despite the overall gayness of this movie, I am sort of pumped up about the 4th installment of the LOTR trilogy. I hear that the next movie actually stars our own Mr. Shoulders. I remember in college when XTIAN, Mr. Shoulder, KenTak3, and I used to get together for study groups. Inevitably, the first thing to happen is that Mr. Shoulders would take off his shoes. DUDE, that guy has big hairy toes. Have you ever tried to do graph isomorphism while staring at some kid's big hairy toes?

        Evil   VH1 – KICKIN' IT OLD SCHOOL  Has anyone watched VH1 lately? I cancelled my cable 2 years ago – in the midst of my rough patch – so I haven't been up to date on the cable scene. But I've started going to the gym recently and  noticed that there's some pretty kick-ass programming on VH1.  They don't show music videos anymore, so if you thought I was going to write about Richard Marx and Lionel Ritchie… wait, I just lost that train of thought. Anyway, there was this one show that pondered, "What if minorities ruled the world?" They asked compelling questions like, "What ethnicity are Bert and Ernie?" My initial reaction was, DUH, Bert is Dominican and Ernie is Mexican. CMON, that's a no-brainer. But then I thought to myself, Wait, I haven't seen too many Dominican/Mexican gay male couplings. Which made me change my mind and say that Bert and Ernie are both white preppy gays. I mean, Bert has this weird pigeon "hobby" and you know how gay male couples do weird things with their money. BTW- the marketers already know this. Marketing targeted at gay males typically has the best ROI out there, owing to the fact that gay male couples have the highest disposable income of all households. Two male, white-collar salaries. Think about that.  (On a side note: What ethnicity is Animal? I always thought that Animal was Albanian, or some other flavor of Eastern European, like maybe Romanian, or more likely, Azerbaijani. Can't you just see that? Animal is that crazy dude from Eastern Block Europe who has only the most rudimentary command of the English language, yet, he gets smashed at the local pub and is the life of the party. Plus, he smells slightly of BO.)  Another great show on VH1 is "I love the 80's". Man, that show ROCKS! They bring back all the old music and celebrities of the 80's and it reminds me of the good old days. They even bring back the toys of the 80's, which is the most kick-ass part. Remember Hungry Hungry Hippos? Woooo! Cabbage Patch Kids? For the record, I never had a Cabbage Patch Kid but I hear that Big Head had five of them. Remember the Glow Worm? Damn, that's old school.  Thinking of the 80's makes me happy and sad at the same time. Things were simple back then, but then again, things were complex. All I really wanted in the 4th grade was to get a HJ in the back row of the school bus from the red-headed, freckled girl who had to avoid direct sunlight at all cost or risk burning up like a protesting Tibetan monk. Funny what they say about "The more things change…" You know the rest. Today, in 2004, all I'm trying to do is to get a HJ in the exit row of a California to New York flight. The chick sitting in my row is not cooperating.

        Evil   Today was a big day for me. I've been waiting for this day for years. Literally. Ladies, gentlemen, friends, and Mr. Shoulders... I am happy to announce that today, I received my renewed passport in the mail. (For some history, see the "FIASCO" post earlier this month.)  My passport has been expired since 1998, so a few years ago, when XTIAN, KenTak3, and Mr. Shoulders went to Montreal, I had to bail. I missed out on seeing Mr. Shoulders pay $30 (Canadian!) to punch a hooker in the stomach. But then again, I bet that's not really too different from seeing Mr. Shoulders pay $30 USD to punch a hooker in the stomach.  Anyway, I just wanted to announce that I am officially good to travel, which is handy, because me and The Future Mrs. Evil are scoping out Bali for our honeymoon.

        Perishable Goods   Yesterday on a lark, I decided it would fun to sit in the 90 degree weather as the As played the Angels.   i called up A&W and Clay and figured we could get psyched up to watch some ball. Clay is only now reading MoneyBall so that would help keep us engaged as we discussed the relative merits of Jeremy Brown and Corey Bradford.  I packed an extra shirt and A&W drove so it was already gearing up for a good time. When we picked up Clay, Clay stopped to admire A&W car. It is a nice car so the admiration is well deserved.  When we arrive at the stadium we park and Clay again stops to glance at the car. This time he notices that it is covered in sap and somewhat scratched. A&W somewhat chastised, admitted that the sap was so frustrating he tried to rub it out the day before and stopped when he realized he was scratching it. Clay suggested a detail shop he knew that could take care of this in a bout an hour.   The game itself was unremarkable, the way most games played in oppresive heat tend to be. The highlight was when we realized that with a AAA membership card we could sit in the 300 level for 4 dollars. (what other team does membership discount deals with AAA? SOmeone save the As!) Btw, the As lost 4-3 and Vlad did not even play so I was pretty frustrated.  Back at Clay's, I sat there reading while Clay took adam to drop off his car for a "1 hour detailing to remove sap" Its around 430. i should be able to make my 6pm dinner party by 7pm nice and easy. Of course, I was not even thinking in these terms. I was severely dehydrated and only thinking about water. What to do What to do.  I don't know how much time passed but i must have fallen asleep because when Clay suggested we watch Sopranos I did not connect it to mean that this meant it was 9pm on the East coast and 6pm on the west coast. After the Sopranos I watched A&W frustratedly try to contact the detail shop and get the update on his car. When he was told it would take another 30 minutes.   By this point, i had gotten a call from my hostess for the dinner party I was meant to attend. Not knowing how to handle this, I went to base instincts (fight or flee) and of course, anyone who knows me knows how that ended. After I pressed the ignore button on my phone I decided to call Darren and half explain why I sucked. Just to practice, so I could see if I could effectively present this argument to Heather and not come off like a scrub. Mission Failed! I could not even bring myself to stick with my phone conversation with Darren, put the phone down and picked up the NYTImes Magazine and played with Clay's cat.  When we finally got to the shop, we had another problem. Suddenly, the interiors guy had run off with with A&W car keys. At this point none of us knew what to do and stood around chatting with the owner of the shop for over an hour. Anxious to get out of there himself, he suggested A&W get his spare and only need to pay on return of his original key. Clay was ready to be done with me as well and suggested that he drop us off at my place and get A&W to and fro to his house to collect the spare and later collect his ride.   By the time it was all said and done, it 10pm and I still did not know how to explain what I had done for the last 4 hours....

        Evil   HAPPY BIRTHDAY KENTAK3  I met The Future Mrs. KenTak3 (TFMKT3) the other night. It was Ken's birthday party at the Gaslight Lounge and a great crowd turned out, owning mostly to TFMKT3's presence I suppose.  Early on, I spent a good 15 minutes being captivated by a tall dude who was recalling his barnstorming of the SoHo Bloomingdales grand opening. "Are you in the fashion industry?," I asked. "No," he said. "I'm a professor of computer science at NYU." Hmm, interesting. Later that evening, I found myself cozying up to that dude's roommate on the couch, making as if I had known her for years. Luckily, no one got punched in the teeth, or if I did, I don't remember because my face was already numb.  At some point, we lost track of Ken, so somebody had to go check the bathroom. Naturally, I was like, "Ezra, go find Ken in the bathroom." Haha. Clearly, I am a bad friend. This is all the more reason for XTIAN to move back to The NYC because someone has to keep an eye on that guy at all times.  On a personal note, might I also add that I met The Future Mrs. Evil (TFME) at Ken's birthday party. She was the co-host of the party, also celebrating her 28th. When I scooted over to say hi, she told me that  she has read this blog!  I immediately attempt to apologize for the misogynistic content on this blog, but I am tripped up by my own words. I fall on my face (figuratively), get up, dust, dust, dust... and place the blame squarely on XTIAN and his influence. I consider mentioning how my posts on the competitive blog are actually quite pro-female, sensitive, and reflective, but instead I concentrate my efforts on not tipping over while speaking to TFME. I think she appreciated that.  In lieu of a coherent ending, I will just mention that I'm heading out to the Knicks/Nets playoff game at MSG. I will wear my Tim Thomas jersey and might get some playing time coming off the bench. Look for me!

        Evil   ALL YOU HAVE TO BRING...  Big Head and I have not had many phone conversations, ever. And when we do, they are usually like this:  "Yo. Where are you?" "In a cab. Almost there." "Ok, see you in a few." "Ok, cool. Bye."  So it was a little strange when Big Head called and wanted to talk about advertising and media. It had something to do with the Yahoo job he's trying to get or whatnot. Which got me thinking...   What is the greatest advertising campaign of our generation?   Was it Nike's Just Do It campaign, which ran for 14 consecutive years and arguably brought experiential marketing to the mainstream? Or, on the other end of the spectrum, was it Apple Computer's 1984 super bowl commercial, which ran only once, seen by relatively few people, but has made such an impact that 20 years later, people still understand references to it?  No.  The greatest advertising campaign of our generation was for  Mount Airy Lodge . C'mon, you know the jingle!   All you have to bring, is your love of ev'rything.   Virtually everyone we know who grew up in the northeast remembers the Mount Airy Lodge commercials. Aided Brand Recall. Check. You know what, whenever someone mentions that they grew up in the Poconos, the first think I'll say is "OH! That's where Mount Airy Lodge is!" Unaided Brand Recall. Check.  A couple of years ago, I read in the Times that Mount Airy Lodge had fallen into dilapidation and disrepair and was making plans to close down permanently. I told my friend (also a northeasterner) and immediately, disappointment shadowed her face. "Oh nooo... that's the saddest thing I've heard in a long time," she said. Brand Favorability. Check.  A slight pause and then a lightbulb went off... "We HAVE TO GO before it closes!" What? The article says that the place is falling apart and she still wants to go? Won't the heart shaped tubs have cracks all over them? Likely. But's that how great the Mount Airy Lodge advertising campaign really was. Purchase Intent. In advertising, it all comes down to purchase intent. Check.

I knew I was back immediately. Even at 2am in LaGuardia, people are talking Yanks/Red Sox. People are acting like its the middle of the day. It was wierd, till I remembered I was in NY. It's always the middle of the day in NY.   I showed up on the first real spring weekend in NYC. NYC came out and said hello in the sluttiest dress she coudl find. The icy chill that brought 20+ plus days of snow this past winter was long gone, and the icky stink of mid summer was still months away. This is NY at its best. People are sitting outside drinking. Women walking around in the latest fashion, white skirts with diagonal stripes which though mini length, frilled outward. These things rock btw, very hot. I highly recommend to any chick with legs worth mentioning...  I don't really have an ending....all i know is that at 4am I was standing on Boulevard East, on the Jersey Side of NY, staring back at the NYC skyline. It felt right all around...

        Evil   FIASCO  I travel a lot for work, but my driver's license has been expired since my most recent birthday. This means I can't rent cars (bad) and I always get frisked at airport security (somewhat good) for not having "valid" government issued photo ID. I tried to get a renewed license. Here's the sequence of events:  1. Show up at the Express DMV (I'm a busy man!) for license renewal. Got rejected because my current license is from California and they only do in-state renewals at the Express DMV.  2. Show up at the regular DMV and wait 2 hours, which isn't bad all things considering. Got rejected because my proof of identity is an expired passport. Crap! I have no physical birth certificate because I was born in Vietnam and they don't really keep records at the hospitals there. Also, there was a war of some sort. So I have to renew my passport first.  3. Show up at the post office with passport renewal form filled out + 2 little headshots of myself + the old passport. Go up to the window. Got rejected because I was 17 when my last passport was issued. Apparently, I can only renew an EXPIRED passport in person if I got my last one at age 16 or younger! (Ironically, I could have also renewed in person if my passport weren't already expired.) They give me a form and say I have to do it by mail.  4. Filled out the form and go to the post office to send it certified mail. (I have to include my old passport, so it's important to get it certified.) Show up at the post office and see a GIANT ASS LINE. Realized that it's April 15 and everyone is filing their taxes. CRAP!  WHAT NOW? Crying...

        In New York...   A Prologue     Hitting the big City this weekend. Looking forward to the weekend, i got it worked out a couple of different ways.  (1) It could be a good time if I get a chance to hang out with my family and catch up with everyone necessary (Cheo, waiting for your call back! What the hell?) (2) It will be a great time, if in addition to hanging out with family, all my lame ass friends make out to OpenAir Saturday night to hang out with me and celebrate how great we all look two years later (3)This trip will be the motherf*cking bomb if i do all that and get a motherf*cking job, yo!

Check it out....if you get a chance   On a related topic:   I don't get these Jerry Seinfeld and Superman commercials. Are they supposed to be an old married couple? Also, is the implication that Superman is cheating on Green Lantern with Jerry Seinfeld? wierd  Watch the Jerry/Superman American Express commercials  urlLink here .   That got me thinking of the time....  Gosh, I guess it was 911, right after the WTC went down. No one knew what was what. I found myself in a IM chatroom with a bunch of heads I knew. They all knew me but that did not really know each other. One of them had a handle that referenced an x-men comic book character. Anyway, it was a heavy day (as one might expect) but  Evil  pops on, and suddenly starts goofing on the AIM ID! Talk about inappropriate....saying stuff like "What if I get a handle thats GreenLantern123? Would that be cool?"  I swear, you can't take that kid anywhere, not even virtually....

       Pointless Predictions.  figure since Baseball is starting up I will give a few predictions  (Ordered by Record) AL EAST - YANKS WILD CARD - RED SOX AL WEST  - ANGELS AL CENTRAL - ROYALS  NL CEnTRAL - CUBS WILD CARD - HOUSTON NL EAST- PHILLIES NL WEST - umm....dodgers? This division sucks awful  Additional points  A-Rod will play the last 90 games at SS and Jeter's game is going to come apart at the seems Contreras won't be with the big club past the all-star break Barry will hit for .305 this year but walk more than ever as the Giants have no one to protect him in the line up.   For those interested, the mets will win about 84 games.  Also, the mets are going to start 10 different pitchers this year that get 5 starts.  Reyes will play about 140 games and steal about 25 and hit for an ok average Matsui will bat about .250 and slide down to 8th in the line up Piazza will play about 30 games at 1st base and then get traded somewhere like Tigers.

       Shrek 2  My wife and I recently took my daughter to watch Shrek 2. I figured it would be a nice movie to watch with the FAMILY. Amazingly, I was actually able to sit through the entire film without me spilling my popcorn on top of someone's head. Anyway, after the movie was over, I found myself very confused. I had just realized that Antonio Banderas' charater Puss N Boots was a closet homosexual. I found this completely appalling, considering that this was my daughter's favorite movie. My daughter is too young for me to speak to her about sexuality, but she is old enough to ask questions about why Puss is hitting on Shrek. This is my moral dilemma. What can I do? What should I do?

       Stupid things you do when you're drunk.  I recently returned from a convention at the jersey shore. It was a beautiful weekend full of barbecues, horseshoes, and alot of liquor. But what compelled me to write about my weekend was what happened during one of the nights we stayed. After a brief stroll down the boardwalk, my wife and I and another couple decidedto go back to the hotel for some drinks. I figured that I could get my wife drunk enough to have sex with me. But, when we arrived back at the hotel, we found the wives of the other members drunk in front of our door trying to pry open our door. They had found out that we were storing several bottles of liquor in our room for which they felt compelled to relieve us of. Well, after beating them off with a stick, I reluctantly gave them a bottle of Hennessey to leave us alone. After about five minutes, the women were back wanting more. I tried to fight off as many women as I could, but I was severely outnumbered. They were able to take a bottle of Hypnotic. I was crushed!! Fortunately, the women left us alone and proceeded to bang on everyone else's door the rest of the night. Unfortunately for me, my wife felt it unwise to drink that night and I ended up relieving myself in the bathroom. What a waste of a weekend!!!

        Evil   Random thoughts for the day...  (1) It was raining but Kentaro and I played golf anyway. Showing some toughness. Until I got home and immediately hit the sack for a nap. Then woke up. Head hurting. Is this why moms don't let their kids play in the rain?  (2) Some words are clearly underused in popular culture. At the top of that list is  Gringo . I mean, how great is that word. It's one of those words that sounds funny even if you don't know what it means. Everyone should make an effort to incorporate  Gringo  into daily conversation. Once a day is fine (to start).  (3) Back to Kentaro. He is a bad person. Let me ask you... who goes and seeks out the video of an American dude getting his head sawed off by some Iraqi dudes? Who has interest in watching something like this? Anyway, if you're interested in that, check this out. It's a video of a  urlLink black kid beating up a white kid . Hilarity ensues.

        Outdated Movie Review   TROY   WOW! Was this movie a questionable choice! Let's start by saying that I loved the  Illiad . Tough book (epic poem) to get thru? Sure, especially with a blind minstrel singing it to you. But the story rocks hard. I liked the fact that the whole thing took 10 years. I liked the fact that no one seemed to have any redeeming qualities. Here is where this movie went wrong:  The whole thing seemed to take about 3 weeks, if you include the 12 days for Hector's burial ceremony.  Odysseus was played up like a hero, wasn't he somewhat greyer in the real story. Here they play it like he has some sway over Achilles, whereas I always had the impression he just duped him.  What is up with Achilles? Brad Pitt played him like a primadonna sports athlete, and he was too F***ing whiney, toughen up yo!  Anyway, no real love for the movie!  I do think that any summer movie watching list should include the following two films:    urlLink Saved      urlLink Garden State

         A man ahead of his time  I find it surprising that no one has mentioned the death of David Dellinger. A true hero of the American people. His views may have been a bit socialist, or maybe even a bit communist. But they were pure; they were honest; and more importantly, they were very accurate. Capitalism has corrupted this society. It has made us believe that we are free while it strips every fabric of individuality from our souls. Is that what we want our lives to become? Take it from me, I envy where David is right now.    Fidel in 2004!

        Evil   DEATH TRAIN  From my new apartment, it takes me 12 minutes to get to work. (Woo hoo!) But I also run the risk of dying at any given point during the ride. (Boooo!) I take the 2/3 and you've probably never noticed, but check out the huge, uninterrupted stretch between 110th Street and 96th Street:     What this means is that the 2/3 is barreling down the tunnel with all of the speed of a Japanese bullet train, but with none of the technology. Every morning I find myself clutching onto the pole for dear life. You'd think this would be a sensible thing to do, except when the train hits one of those 90 degree turns (see map above) and slams my balls right into the pole.  I am still alive today. Enjoy me while you can.

        Evil   My new apartment is randomly smelly. I can't figure it out. Like, in the bedroom, the corner where the dresser is smells like very ripe papaya. It actually smells sort of nice for a second, but you can tell the papaya is 5 minutes away from rottenness. Except that there's no papaya. Where's that smell coming from?!  My kitchen in general smells like feet. Not my feet. But it's a generic feet smell. I bet no one's feet actually smells like that. But if someone engineered a Scratch-N-Sniff sticker of feet, it would smell like my kitchen. Not very appetizing, I know. I didn't invite you over for dinner though, so leave me alone.  The area near the stove smells like smoke and ash. Oh wait, that makes sense.  When I lie on my bed, the scent of dryer sheets lingers on the half of the bed that's empty. I think there's a laundry room right outside my window. It must be in the next building. There's no laundry room in this building. There's no drop off laundromat in a 5 block radius. I really have no idea what the laundry situation is. I've started wearing suits to work. That's the only thing that's still clean. At some point, I might start wearing suits to bed. At least my bed smells laundry fresh.

        Evil   The cleaning lady set my apartment on fire, leaving me with a dusting of ash and a moral dilemma.        These pictures are just a re-creation of the scene... notice the cleaned up stovetop and the wipe marks on the cabinet.  Here's how things went down:  I get this cleaning lady from craigslist because I was moving into a new apartment and I had a feeling that the crackwhore who used to live there wasn't so clean. So the cleaning lady comes, I let her in, and I tell here I'll be back in 3 hours. Off I went to finish packing my old apartment for the move.  I come back 3 hours later, open the door, and the cleaning lady stands there startled. Black smudges are all over her face. She tells me there was a fire. I go, What? She explains. Her story seems implausible. I have never in my life seen fire appear out of nowhere, with no warning.  Here is my dilemma: the cleaning lady said she would take responsibility... pay for the replacement parts to the fridge, the stove burner, clean up the walls. That sounded good, but now I feel bad about it. The replacement parts come out to about $150. Is that a lot of money to a cleaning lady? Was it really her fault to begin with, or just dumb luck? Should I offer to pay half?  I have her address. She lives in the East Village. There's a good chance she pays more rent than me, considering that I live in a crackden in Harlem. Every other building up here is boarded up.  What should I do? Weigh in!

        Happy Birthday!   Today, The Hose turns 1 years old! That's pretty exciting no? No, I guess its not. What had initially started as me talking about what was going on last summer in Brazil is now a completely different thing. I can't even describe it. I know for about 3 months all anyone did was talk NBA Playoffs (btw, NETS!) then that ended. We tried a B School thing, but I was the only tool in B School.  Then no one knew what to do. At various points we had a number of random contributors show up but none had the interest or humoric (not a word) consistency to deliver on a day to day basis. Even the guys who did stick around lack those traits, but, what are you gonna do, right? It looks like its just going to be me, Evil, and Sleeve moving forward.   Thanks to everyone who has written or read. which i think sums up to 4 people total!  Here's what to look out for in the year ahead: X-Tian moves back to NY, sells out to the man and fails to get a girlfriend Evil fresh off the biggest IPO of the century somehow still fails to translate it into getting any ass. Sleeve manages to keep lots of random ass around just in case

        Smarter than its target Audience     Ok, I love Tina Fey. I love her wit, I love "Weekend Update" I love her geek cool style, and I love the scar on her left cheek. ANYWAY, the point was I was going to give Mean Girls a chance no matter what.  And let me tell you, I loved it. It was clearly smarter than its target audience. They took the idea of a  Heathers  took the campiness and darkness out of it and made it a little snarkier. Its really hard to think Lindsay Lohan could ever be a dork, so its cool they acknowledged that and made her a product of her upbringing. The metaphor of High School as a jungle though old felt fun here as Lohan's character tried to find analogues for her new world in her old one.   Tina Fey rocks!  Also, the thing was basically a celebration of overdeveloped 16 year old boobs! Its a winner for everyone.

        Evil   CAMP X-RAY, UPPER EAST SIDE  We live in tumultuous and uncertain times. People used to laugh at others who constantly crane their heads upward to check that the sky is indeed not falling. But now you never know, whether it's the bigness of planes above your head or the smallness of microbes before your face. So you might well imagine my consternation when the peace of my apartment was invaded by a big ass bumblebee.  When I first saw him I leapt to my feet. I swatted at him. He evaded. I swatted again. He dashed. He dodged. I decided to put on some pants seeing as the window shades were wide open.  With pants on, I got serious. Swat. Swat. Flailing. Failing. But wait. The wind from my swatting just pushed the bee into the ceiling lights. The heat stunned it. It fell to the ground. I dumped out my metal mesh garbage can and used it to cover him. YES!     Hour 1 of captivity: He buzzes around wildly, sometimes smashing against the metal mesh. I ignore him.  Hour 2 of captivity: He has calmed down. I walk over and ask rhetorically, "Who's tough now?" I walk away.  Hour 3 of captivity: I rap viciously against the side of the metal mesh and he falls off. He climbs back on. I lift the garbage can slightly and thump it hard on the ground. He falls off again. I laugh. I tell him I'm going to H&M to buy some linen shirts for spring. I go.  Hour 6 of captivity: I consider spraying him with some chemicals stashed beneath the sink. I decide not to, because doing so would be cruel.  Hour 9 of captivity: He is now on the floor. I lift his cage. Is he still alive? Yes, he's moving, but sluggish. I snap a few photos (above).  Hour 18 of captivity: The next morning. I check on him. He's dead.

        Bourgeois Tendencies   Recently I caught myself judging people I love. I was having dinner with some family, and someone was explaining how she conned some flight attendant into giving her a bottle of champagne. Her shtick included pointing out how both my cousins had recently graduated and how they were all traveling to SF in order to celebrate. As it were it was something to celebrate, but the point of her story is that she, as a high power sales executive with more frequent flyer miles than anyone EVER deserved that sort of treatment. She then lightly disparaged Southwest Airlines for treating everyone the same regardless of how important they are to sustaining the fragile airline industry. I, a product of Berkeley and Columbia but still a child of the working class, was offended. You see, I am down with the proletariat in spirit if not in recent experience and I think everyone (even the depressingly poor) should be treated well on flights. I mean besides, who the hell do flight attendants think they are? How much are they pulling down a year?    From my perch on a nice couch in the bar of a high priced hotel on Nob Hill I smugly judged the bourgeois tendencies of people who have only ever showed me love. I felt bad about it for a moment but then was reassured by my own smugness.  Of course, later, I realized what everyone always assumes about me…I am completely full of shit.   I was flying to the ATL, Hot-lanta (Holla if ya hear me!) to resume my career after 18 months of waking up at 10am in B School. It was Sunday and I had to get in by Monday morning, my flight was at 5pm I would get in by 8pm and it would all be great. For a moment let me digress and point out that Newark Airport is the most ghetto airport ever. I need to stop going there and start flying out of LaGuardia; it’s really the only airport I can tolerate. By the time I got to the gate it became apparent that there was some trouble, the flight had already been delayed till 6 and every other delta flight heading anywhere (all of them seem to go to Atlanta) was similarly delayed. In the distance, a Russian man berated the desk representative and asking her if he was her slave. The attendant, repping hardcore for jersey trash, told him to shut up and sit down. Not knowing what else to do, I curled up in a ball on the floor and fell asleep.   I was awoken and taken and on board the plane by 7pm.  Everyone was confident that we would get to Hot-lanta (holla if ya hear me!) by 10pm. I was surprised to notice that I was seated in seat 1C. That’s right! First class! My neck was hurting from sleeping on the floor so I welcomed this surprise despite the reservations of my inner xtian. When the flight attendant offered me a drink I gladly welcomed a rum and diet coke. Maybe it wasn’t so bad up here. Who doesn’t need this once in a while? People were asked to take their respective seats, the engine started, the plane moved towards the runway, and then the pilot got on the intercom and sadly stated that airport in Atlanta was shut down for at least an hour. The flight attendant sadly pointed out that there was no movie for flights of less than 3 hours. I pulled  urlLink Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim  out of my bag and continued reading. I gladly took a second and later a third rum and diet coke. Sitting in the first row I was able to put my legs up with my feet flat to wall in front of me and celebrated the leg room in the first row. I don’t know about heaven, but I can’t remember a happier moment in my life. While we waited the flight attendant proved to be very flirtatious and attentive, by my fifth drink I was gearing up to ask her to join me in the bathroom…  Into the second hour on the runway, waiting to take off, I was handed a very nice cobb salad. In first class, apparently you still get to eat meals. Who knew? Hungry as a mother fucker I gobbled it down in 5 minutes. Momentarily, I looked back and pitied the poor slobs in coach. How can people live like that? I began chatting up the attendant and pointed that within the last month I had (1) graduated with an MBA (2) had a birthday and (3) was beginning a new job. As a token of congratulations she handed me a small bottle of champagne. I thanked her profusely.  We finally got off the ground and touched down in Atlanta around midnight. As we were landing the flight attendant asked everyone whose final destination was Atlanta to stay in their seats to give the people connecting to somewhere else a fight chance to make their flights. I assumed these instructions were primarily for everyone in the main cabin not for the Brahmans in first class. I calmly collected my things and promptly stepped to the exit door. I was the first person out the door and made sure to step briskly to avoid the manic onrush of plebeians behind me.

        What type of drunk are you?   So I go to Happy Hour on Friday evening with my entourage and even though I like to live in the moment, I am also kind of planning a few steps ahead...so 5 minutes after I get there, I check all the girls in the group and I strike a conversation with this young lady who is a friend of a friend of a friend...Anyways, she offers to buy me a martini but I had to turn it down...I told her I only really drink beer because I can't handle hard liquor. I tell her that if I drink hard liquor, I get drunk faster and when I am drunk, I get horny...For curiousity's sake, I asked her what does she usually do when she gets horny...she refused to answer...Taking her silence as a sign, and being the nice person I am, I volunteered my services...I told her that if its a long night and midnight rolls around and she is horny, and she wants to resolve her horniness issues, then I will gladly oblige...I explained to her it was one of those pacts old friends do (like, the one Xtian and Evil did that if they are not married by the age of 40, they will marry each other).  Anyways, she gets all huffy and puffy and walks away towards her friends (and I am assuming) to tell them what a dork I am...I later find out that she is a 26 year old virgin and nobody had ever talked to her that way...it turns out she was in a convent in Alaska for the past 8 years. Nice!   The moral of the story is that nuns shouldn't be out in public and least of all at a bar @ happy hour...  While we are at it, what is the deal with all those young single mothers? You meet them and then later find out that they have 2-3 rugrats back at home being babysat by their grumpy grandmother...there should be a law that young single mothers can't go out, at least not until their children are of legal age and there is a possibility that their 19 year old daughter is going to join the action.  Maybe I am hanging out with the wrong crowd....  You saw the note Bush sent to the new Iraqi Prime Minister..."Let Freedom Reign"...I didn't know Bush could spell "let" or "freedom" or "reign"...

        Evil   BACK!  The bubble is back, baby! I saw in the news that some company went and  urlLink bought SBI.Razorfish  for $160 million in cash and notes. Consider that when SBI bought Razorfish back in late 2002, the price was only $8.2 million. 20x bump in valuation... not bad. Also recall that SBI.Razorfish additionally includes the assets of Scient (HAHAHA!) and iXL.

        Evil   PRODUCTIVE MEMBER OF SOCIETY  Congrats to XTIAN, who today is officially back in the workforce, earning an honest living. After sitting on his ass for two years and hiding from the realities of the world (aka Business School), I'm glad that someone is now earning a salary and paying taxes. I will also be glad when someone cashes his first sales commission check, so that I can enjoy the viewing pleasure of this new high-definition plasma TV.

         One-Man Bukkake Show    Let me present to you a hypothetical situation that happened to (ahem) a friend of mine...A girl comes over to your (your friend's) new place but its "her" time of the month so you (your friend) is somewhat limited as to what he can do.  In order to avoid paying the cleaning lady extra you (your friend) forego the normal repertoire of patented moves and you go for the old bj...you are having a grand old time and all of a sudden, there is "man juice" all over her face and breasts.  You draw a couple of happy faces and stick figures with your drawing tool and then you pass her the bounty and send her to get herself cleaned up...  This aforementioned young woman then calls you the next morning and tells you that she just came from the eye doctor because some "man juice" had gotten into her right eye the night before and her eye had gotten all red and puffy.   My hypothetical question is that given the fact that she has no health insurance (damn the fact that we have no universal health care) and she had to pay close to $250 in eye drops and the doctor's visit, is my friend obligated to repay her? Are these risks she should have been aware of? Is this part of the fine print, part of the social contract? Are these occupational hazards and is therefore my friend free from any liability?   Curious in Miami...

        Evil   PASTY WHITE BOY FROM INDIANA  This is my outdated news commentary because I am perpetually 3 days to 3 months behind the world. Anyway, Charles Barkley made an amusing comment:   "I'll tell you what was really funny was . . . we always thought it was an insult when they put (Bird) on one of us, because he was the worst defensive player ever," Barkley said.   Larry Bird is right though. The league really does need more white stars. It's interesting to note that the league's best Chinese player is far and away better than the league's best white player. Witness:      I love how Mark Madsen is totally getting mugged in that photo.

The magazine--a fashion, beauty, and entertainment book aimed at 20- to-30-something Asian-American women...   I mean, CMON! What do I have to do to break into the New York Asian Media scene. Let's face it. That couldn't be a big scene. It's like breaking into a group of 11. Yet another affirmation that I am not popular. Oh wait, you are a blog reader, not my shrink. I will take this up with her...  On an unrelated note, but still regarding Asians. Did anyone notice the new  urlLink Friendster  CEO? He's Japanese!!! Scott Sassa. You wouldn't know by the name, but the dude really is Japanese.  urlLink Check out his pic and bio.   Can someone fill me in on how a Japanese dude gets a last name like Sassa? Someone?

        Evil   NOT AN OUTDATED MOVIE REVIEW -- Garden State  I caught an advanced screening of Garden State earlier this week. The movie stars Natalie Portman, who -- I am disappointed to report -- looks a bit older and a lot less space-er-iffic than the last time I saw her. Why can't 14 year old girls remain 14 forever? Oh wait, forget I said that last part. Anyway, the movie also stars some other dude, whose character grew up in New Jersey, which means that his character was basically unbearable. I mean, popping anti-depressants, moping around, bouncing around Hollywood doing various acting gigs. Why can't that guy just get a cushy job at Morgan Stanley and drive around in an Audi? That's clearly the thing to do.  Back to Natalie Portman. She was great. Greater than great. Her character is some spazz. They used a medical term to describe it. Eppilepstick. Something like that. She was so spazzy, she needed to wear a helmet on a day to day basis. I thought that was great. Natalie Portman looks cute in a helmet. And besides that, she did a great job with the character because the character could have easily been one annoying chick, but as it turned out, what might have been annoying turns out to be endearing.  To be honest, I don't remember much about the movie. I'm a bad movie watcher that way. It did have a prominent soundtrack tho. Too prominent. Every other scene cut away to some "emo" track. I mean, wasn't Kid A so 5 years ago?  Did I have a point? Clearly not. I am just trying to up my word count! HAH!

        Evil   Some of you might be wondering's what's the latest with my nephew, Jason. You know, the emotionally-scarred-by-parents, unhealthy-relationship-with-food, emotionally-withdrawn kid. Well, my sister reports that Jason was caught hitting another kid in daycare because the other kid tried to take his sippy cup. Jason's favorite word is "NO!", which he uses in almost all contexts, but maybe that's because he only knows two words (the other is "Daddy"). The kid hasn't learned how to say "Mommy" yet, which I think is hilarious.

        Summer TV   TV in the summer used to be a dead zone full of repeats or something. But now there are two great new shows on TV and I have been watching both religiously for the last week.      Blow Out  The Gayest Concept ever that seemingly has zero gay people in sight. Hairstylist Jonothan Antin wants build a second location to his incredibly popular west Hollywood Salon but this time in Beverly Hills. Normally no one would care, certainly not I, but as I was flipping thru the channels I caught a glipse of Jonothan, equally narcissistic and dull looking at a empty space on Rodeo Dr speak (in a public voice) "I am going to build here the greatest salon in the history of the world ever!" and I was hooked.  Not since Rocco have I found such a moron compelling TV watching. The upside of Blow Out is that Jonothan seems to have hotter chicks hanging around, placing far too much value on their ability to style hair. It also included a random guest appearance by Kate Bodsworth (of  Blue Crush  fame) who I guess had nothing better going on. Check Bravo for airings, its Bravo so they will probably show the premiere 19 more times.     Summerland  What happens when three recently orphaned kansas farm children move in with four 40ish singles who live in a beach house in San Diego? Absolutely nothing! But it happens in the creepiest way possible!Technically, Aunt Becky stars in this show but really has no credibility as the 'cool' 45 year old aunt from California just starting out in the fashion world. The first episode followed the youngest boy Derrick on his journey to try to kill himself so he could hang out with his parents on his mom's birthday...his suicide plans included sitting under a tree and hanging out by the beach. Derrick's second episode story was about launching a rocket...what the f*ck, right?  There also seems to be a lot of unnecessary touching between adults and kids on the show, when teen Braiden comes home drunk he picks a fight with Surfer "dude" Jay and the whole thing ends up looking like something off of www.chickfight.com .

        Evil   THE OFFICIAL PASTTIME OF SUMMER  There's a simple way to tell whether or not your neighborhood is keepin' it real: by the amount of stoop-sitting that takes place. I just moved and I've noticed that there's much stoop-sitting activity around me and I'm glad to see that. It reminds me of the old neighborhood, of growing up. The old neighborhood had lots of stoops and also lots of asses to sit on them. The asses mostly belonged to Colombian dads and moms. On summer evenings, my parents always liked to go for walks around the neighborhood -- mostly from our house to the elementary school and back. This was before everyone had cable and Xbox, so after-dinner family entertainment was decidedly low tech. I remember we would walk past house after house, decorated with sitters on their stoops. The kids of the family would be out front, kicking around a soccer ball. My dad liked to cheer, "Maradona! Maradona!" when he saw Colombian kids playing soccer. In retrospect, I don't know if that was a stupid thing to say or what because I wouldn't want no Colombian dude coming up to me and cheering "General Tso! General Tso!" I'm just glad no one ever got popped in the eye.  Anyway, my new neighborhood is kind of like the old neighborhood, except that most of the families here are black. Not much kicking around of soccer balls, but there is much grilling of meats on the street. On a random summer night, I see at least one active grill per block, you know, the ones that are huge half-spheres will three legs sticking out of them. Seeing this makes me want to get a grill. I swear I could eat grilled meats three times a day. But I'm hesitating on that decision because really, how sad would that look? Some random Chinese dude who is grilling all by himself. Most likely I will also be sobbing quietly to myself. Also likely, I will be wearing clown makeup.  I don't know. Maybe I'll get a grill anyway. I'm going to go think about it. Outside, sitting on the stoop.

        Evil   Go Pistons! Who's better than Ben Wallace? Nobody!  I am a little disappointed that the NBA Finals are on ABC. I liked it much better when the earlier rounds were on NBC, or whatever network has Marv Albert and Mike Fratello. I love it during Laker games when Kobe drives to the hoop and the announcer shouts, "WHAT GREAT PENETRATION BY KOBE!" It gives me the mental image that Marv and The Czar are doing play-by-play for a Kobe rape scene. That shit cracks me up every time.  (The above is funny all around, besides just the Kobe/rape thing... Marv Albert and sexual deviance is a winner every time. And imagine The Czar telestrating a rape. This could be an edgy SNL skit, if SNL were an x-rated show.)

        Evil   OFFICE CLOWNERY  Although I supposedly work with a bunch of smart people, sometimes I think everyone is just a clown inside. (I know I am.) Here are some crazy ass observations from around the office.   One.  There's a sign posted above the main fax machine. It reads, "Please don't throw out any signed contracts that come in on this fax!" DUDE, I couldn't imagine that this sign was put up for no reason. Can you imagine that at some point, some clown was going around trashing signed contracts? Isn't that the only important thing that comes in via fax? Who knows.   Two.  Our VP of Sales sent an email to the entire office yesterday. It was a plea for everyone to be more considerate... stuff like, please don't throw trash on the ground, and please don't go around knocking over garbage cans. The email was bizarre. It came from the guy whose team has a $1 Billion quota for the year (or something like that. Or maybe the quota is a trillion. It's a big number, let's just say that). And he's concerning himself with how trashy (literally!) the office looks. At one point, I thought the email was going to say, "And one last thing, if you take a shit in the bathroom, please don't smear your feces all over the walls." But he didn't actually write that. I was relieved. (No one has caught me yet!)   Three.  We have the cutest summer intern ever! Of all time!!! She's from some small university that I never heard of. Given that this company is known for hiring brainiacs, I am going to assume this girl slid by on her looks. And boy am I glad she did! My morale has been up 100% since she's been here. Just by virtue of ogling her for 45 minutes (cumulative) each day.  Yesterday was Friday and the intern clearly ran out of business clothes. She shows up to work wearing something that probably belonged to her mom. Ill-fitting. Old-fashioned looking. Crazy outfit that made her look like a 1950's secretary. But whatever, she is way cute. Not hot. Cute. Like, cute face, nice body, if slightly chubby. This girl fits into one of two profiles, but definitely nothing in between...  Profile A: Cute. Has never been poked.  Profile B: Has been poked continuously since age 14. Abandoned vaginal at around age 17. Now exclusively into anal.  I'm not sure which it is.

        Notes from Boston   (or rather notes from Northern NJ, where the TV has been stuck on MSNBC for 4 days)   Boy do the democrats know how to throw a party! The only other fiscally conservative bunch i know that can get down like this just got indicted over that whole Tyco mess.  It seems to me that the fundamental strategy for this campaign is "Assume most people are as disturbed by GWB's born-again fuckwaddery as we are, drag our asses to the middle of the road, and try not too piss off too much of the core lefties." Sure that worked for Bill C. but he's a lot different than Frankenstien. No one wants to bang Frankenstien, where as everyone (men, women, children and EVIL) really wanted to hook up with Bill. I'm hating myself for saying this, but thank god Al Sharpton got to speak...    The convention over all was a bit of a drag but one interesting story that developed was the race to see who on the dems side could match the sheer over the top sexiness of the president's nephew, George Prescott Bush. As you may recall GPB made a spectacle of himself during the last RNC in 2000, jumping in front of every camera in sight, just so Uncle George could point to his mexican nephew...  The race came down to a few contenders          Barak Obama      Ben Affleck         Dennis Kucinich      Chris Heinz      You can vote here for your choice....

        Evil   A one-armed, zero-legged man in introducing John Kerry. The one-armed, zero-legged man has a cheery smile. More cheery than I would have expected.  He's also fatter than I would have expected. For some reason, I always expect one-armed, zero-legged people to be skinny... gaunt. But no! Mental stereotypes have been broken tonight.

Her nose looks spectacular! Good for her for getting that nose fixed!  Will these two girls stop telling dumb-ass stories about their dad. Girls, the country couldn't care less. Really. Who is the strategist in the Kerry camp? That person sure as heck isn't George Stephanuphalous.  Is it too late to pick a new Democratic nominee? I really wouldn't be able to stand having this family in the public eye for the next 4 years.

I'm not just refering to the fact that he looks like he died in 1998. I mean, he's unconditionally an ugly dude. I just realized how ugly he is... whoa! His two daughters look like my feet. Damn. Them are strong "ugly genes" he's got.

Pulled tight. CMON! There is something amiss here.  I think Bob Dole is dead. His face looks really waxy. It reminds me of Uday and Qusay Hussein after they got shot up and the morticians re-built their faces in wax. Bob Dole is creeping me out. The Republicans just lost my vote. I am going independent.

Kerry  sucks monkey balls, and I'm saying that based solely on how boring this convention is.  If I were running this show, Jamie Spears would be the keynote speaker. Holy cow, have you seen her lately? She looks exactly like her older sister, except that I'm pretty sure she hasn't been sullied by Colin Ferrell.     I would also have Mary Kate and Ashley speak. They look like little toads, but cmon. When you think of entrepreneurship, who do you think of? Yes, Mary Kate and Ashley. We should all try to be more like them.

        Evil   TWO GUYS, DESPERATE FOR FAME  In lieu of having a publicist who is actually aware that she's our publicist, I am appointing myself to the post of Interim Director of Online Marketing for The Hose. And I've already executed my first marketing campaign! See how good I am?  Here's the deal: XTIAN and EVIL are two dudes who are desperate for fame. Specifically, we NEED to get on VH1. On-camera work. Fame! Failing that, we might settle for an on-camera role on MTV.  As such, we need to get our good work (this blog!) in front of some VH1 and MTV executives. As of right now, The Hose has a marketing campaign running on Google. Search for any VH1 or MTV executive, and there should be an ad targeted toward that exec, promoting The Hose. For example, Mimi James is VH1's SVP of Talent and Creative Development. Search for her on Google and look for our ad!  (If you don't see our ad and it's late in the day, it could be that we've exhausted our ad budget for the day. But try again the next day!)  Just for kicks, here is the list of VH1 and MTV executives whose name should work on this campaign:   VH1  Christina Norman	President Doug Rohrer	EVP and General Sales Manager Michael Hirschorn	EVP News and Production Nigel Cox-Hagan	SVP and Creative Director Laura Nelson	SVP Communications Cliff Lachman	SVP Production and Development Ben Zurier	SVP Programming Strategy Mark McIntire	SVP Sponsorship Development and Integrated Marketing Richard Gay	SVP Strategy and Business Operations Mimi James	SVP Talent and Creative Development Melissa Cobb	VP Motion Pictures and Television   MTV  Judy McGrath	Chairman and CEO John Cucci	CFO Herb Scannell	President, MTV Networks Group Van Toffler	President, MTV: Music Television, MTV2, and MTV Films Harvey Ganot	President, MTV Networks Advertising Sales Worldwide Bill Roedy	President, MTV Networks International Brian Graden	President, Entertainment, MTV and VH1 Brent Hansen	President and CEO, MTV Europe Frank Brown	President, MTV Asia Pacific Larry Divney	President, Comedy Central Cyma Zarghami	President, Nickelodeon Albie Hecht	President, Spike TV Christina Norman	President, VH1 Brian Phillips	SVP and General Manager, CMT Li Yifei	Managing Director, MTV Networks China Karen Flischel	Managing Director, Nickelodeon International Alex Ferrari	COO, MTV Networks International Carole Robinson	EVP Communications JoAnne Griffith	EVP Human Resources David Sussman	EVP Law and Business Affairs and General Counsel Doug Rohrer	EVP and General Sales Manager, MTV and VH Susan Danaher	EVP and General Sales Manager, Nickelodeon/Nick at Nite and TV Land Tina Exarhos	EVP Marketing, MTV and MTV2 Tom Calderone	EVP Music and Talent Programming, MTV and MTV2 David M.

I would have thought she'd be too big a star for something like this, but Evil and I as F list celebrities would be more than willing to appear at a Target Opening. Guys like Sleave and Manolo are so hard up for appearances they're showing up at Grey's Papaya at 3am greeting hobos as they get egg sandwiches...they'd do this sort of thing in a second...

        Evil   I think I've become a fan of Sleeve's competitive blog. I checked in this morning, and to my delight, there was a new post and also a kick ass custom logo to go with the post. Imagine that! A custom logo just for a post!     Look at that creativity... merging the Parks logo with the MLB logo. Look at that attention to detail. That's not a regular bat, it's a whiffle bat!

        Bowling Alley Brawl      So I think I mentioned here before about my Monday night trips across the Hudson to my favorite Dominican suburb of NYC, Union City NJ. Union City is the home to  urlLink Bowlrite , and it's $1.25 games and Bud Lights.   The clientele is usually about 80% Dominican teenager, wearing assorted football, baseball, and or basketball jerseys and gear. One of my favorites this week was Nate "tiny" Archibald All-Star jersey from the early 80's. The are for the most part well behaved, with the exception of when the occassional group of 15 attempts to share one game in the lane next to you... I always end up going straight after work, which sucks cause I always get there in my work clothes, and wish I had worn my Roy Tarpley authentic 2003 Mavericks jersey. A jersey that really makes no sense, because Tarpley never wore their newer dark blue uniforms, but my mom didn't think about that when she decided to get it for me for christmas a couple years ago. That shit is next level... the reverse of the throwback.. and old player in the team's new threads, it blows jersey aficionados' minds whenever i wear it.  So Monday night at Bowlrite it was getting pretty damn crowded around 11:30pm or so, and they made a previously unheard of announcement over the PA system, "If you're not bowling, playing pool, or video games, you must leave!"  I didn't think much of it due to the fact that I was on my 7th Bud Light on an empty stomach, which btw resulted in the first time i actually ever felt drunk off Bud Lights. I noticed the group of slightly too large for their clothes girls jump up and look over us to the right... As soon as I turned my head, I see this guy come flying into a small crowd about 30 feet away all WWE style and clock someone over the head with what at the time i thought was a deep dish pizza pan. It sounded just like the steel chair. THDONK... again... THDONK... some kicking and punching ensues and the next thing you know, half of them scramble, while the other half huddled around two kids. One is obviously stunned and stumbling with an Eric Lindros-style concussion.. he looked like Kurt Warner in the opening game last year where he fumbled 5 times... the other dude emerges holding his face together. he's a bleeder, but manages a convincing, "I'm alright, I'm alright!" and goes to the bathroom to access the damage and wash the blood... like 20 seconds later, I'm like, "let's bowl" and have the whole alley to myself for that frame.  It wasn't until about 15 minutes later, when the 5 NJ State cops showed up, that I realized the steel top of the industrial ashtray/trashcan next to us was missing, and that's what the deep dish steel chair was.

What ever happened to the good old times of taking your shirt off and dancing on top of the bar.&nbsp; Or is it the old adage, what happens in Astoria stays in Astoria... &nbsp; Anyways, I am going to be in&nbsp;NYC from July 23-26 and I expect some wild crazy times. I think July 24th will be a total loss but we can make something happen the other days.

"Yo, help me figure something out," he says. "Yah, whatup," I say.    &nbsp;  He wants me to walk him through how I manage to pay my rent each month. Specifically, now that he's graduated business school and has a job working for The Man, he himself wants to know how he's going to make his own rent payments.    &nbsp;  How absurd is this question? Someone who is going to pull in well over six figures per year should not have dillemas about maintaining food, shelter, and clothing at livable levels. I think someone needs to grow up. I think someone needs to stop prefacing his sentences with "Now that I'm an adult..." and actually starting being an adult.    &nbsp;  Shout out to Someone Who Does Not Know What She Wants (SWDNKWSW)!    &nbsp;  Evil, OUT.

But seriously, if they keep getting on the PA system and telling everyone to ignore the fire alarms, I am just not going to come in to work anymore.

        Creating a healthy sense of self loathing is good for everyone and better&nbsp;when you are the traumatizer rather than the traumatizee &nbsp;  &nbsp;  When I was little, I was equally cute and crazy. As such I was capable of inspiring a wide range of emotions. When combined with mother’s apparent tourette’s syndrome it would lead to some interesting results.&nbsp;  &nbsp;  Periodically, mother would spy me playing with GI Joes and stop and stare. After some time I would look up and she’d quickly turn away. It was quick but in my mind’s eye I always imagined she was looking at me with mild disappointment. Grief stricken,&nbsp;I’d look down…and then it’d come…in a high shrieking voice with chin up and some sick mix of pride:  &nbsp;  “MONKEY!”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Yes her declarations were sporadic. But the impact of&nbsp;her cruelty hung over my head everyday in exactly the same way the smell of fried plantains clung to my jeans.  &nbsp;  Thankfully, along with the loud smelly mess came the Bumpasaurus and I was allowed a reprieve. No longer was I the victim of the vicious monkey chant, but in turn it was now left for Bump, and really he deserved the title more. As a toddler he sucked his toes happily and seemed to have arms longer than his legs. Of course even this minor happiness would be taken from me. My maternal uncles and aunts, young enough to never take themselves or anyone else too serious took to calling us both “monkey boy” and even developed something of a theme song, “mon KEEEY BOOOOY! Mon KEEY BOOY”  &nbsp;  After some time, we both got over it. Whenever someone yelled “Monkey Boy”, one or both of us would look up and reply as though someone had not said something really offensive. Just once, either bump or I should have had the courage to say something like&nbsp;“You wouldn’t call us that if we were black!”…that would have fixed it…maybe…probably not…  &nbsp;  Like avictims of sexual abuse or a kidnapping victim we soon sided with our oppressors. Rather than break the cycle, we immediately began looking for our own victims to dehumanize. Our younger cousins all fell victim at one time or another.&nbsp;It didn't always stick,&nbsp; besides “monkey girl” is far meaner than it ever was funny. That is until came the most ultimate monkey boy, or as the Bumparsaurus refers to him Monkey Boy 1 or MB1 for short.  &nbsp;  Dude, MB1 is on a different level. His arms are so gangly that when he walks he comes off like an elephant trying to put a condom on with his nose.&nbsp;He might be&nbsp;the messiah of monkey boys. I suppose that would&nbsp;then make&nbsp;the Bumpasaurs his John the Baptist, announcing his arrival. On a good day, I might get to be Abraham but more than likely I'm probably just Jonah sitting inside a fat whale begging for repentence.

        Worst Sports Moves Ever       Lost in the hoopla of Shaq and Kobe’s divorce is the fact that the NJ Nets traded Kenyon Martin for 3 lottery protected draft picks.&nbsp; Now I recognize that real story here is Shaq/Kobe revealing that the true source of their issues over the last couple of years is their on again off again love affair but I just can’t seem to care. What I am interested in is the deranged, stuttering maniac from my home state. The self professed “Bad Ass Yellow Boy” is the heart and soul of the NJ Nets and now he’s gone and the Nets are going to be horrible and it sucks. Yes he has a temper problem, and that stuttering jag is unnerving, and he has no jump shot and his knees suck. But he’s the fifth or sixth most intimidating guy in the NBA. Guys like Antoine Walker and Jermaine O’neal shit their pants when they see K-Mart coming.  &nbsp;  This Bruce Ratner guy is a complete clown. Not only is he a fundamentally evil corporate stooge but he needs to make everything about that. Who buys a sports team and tries to run it like a business. He should meet the guy who owns the Texas Rangers, Tom Hicks, that guy made his money in LBOs and he runs his freaking team like it’s a monopoly game. Sports teams are big boy toys you dumb f*ck! Why don’t you focus on what you do best, displacing the working class of the five boroughs with his luxury high rises and other offensive crap. Jeez I hate this guy.  &nbsp;  Having said all that, I think the NY Jets absolutely deserve a Manhattan stadium and their owner, Woody Johnson is a spectacular human being.  &nbsp;  The most unnerving thing about the Lakers trade is the only guy they got back was Lamar Odom and the Goods, though a great player is a mess. That guy, in his eyes, it says that he’s one terse comment away from doing coke lines off a fifty year old tranny prostitute’s belly.

        Too Punk Rock for This   &nbsp;    I might be too punk rock for this. I’m not sure yet and I’m somewhat scared that I will figure it out too late to be able to do anything about it, that somehow I will come to the conclusion just before I am on the verge of a major success. Right there as papers are about to get signed and plans are about to be made for what to do with all the money I could make, I will realize that I don’t give two shits about the Escalade and I’ll do what everyone who’s ever been self defeating has ever done…you know…defeat myself. Pee on someone, maybe share a racial epithet or two…whatever gets the job done.  &nbsp;  It’s really odd. On paper I got all the tools to make for someone who can do well in corporate America. It’s like I’m Mike Mamula or Tony Mandarich to large corporations - a big tool with lots of upside. Instead of having a vertical, or impressive bench strength (actually I have that) or great wing span (wait, that’s a check too…I’m practically proportioned like a monkey) Instead of these things I have the “combine” credibility corporate America values, I have good height, solid (borderline great) academic credentials, a full head of hair that promises to continue stay black well into my fifties before settling in a mellow salt/pepper blend, all topped off with a scary blend of wit and charm. At the end of the day I got all the things that matter except I guess for membership in the illuminati.  &nbsp;  But like I pointed out earlier I just might be too punk rock for all of it. You’d figure somewhere over the course of business school someone would have stopped me and pointed this out to me. Shit, how did I get into B School in the first place? &nbsp;There are a couple of tell-tale signs:  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp; The way I wear my hair – Inspired by Ewan MaGregor’s Catcher Block in Down with Love, I recently started coifing my hair with a part and a half comb back. Except my part is not a straight line drawn with a comb its sort of zig-zaggy much like a road allowed given over to overgrowth? The end result is that instead of inspiring a early sixties hipster I end up mocking the convention with small rebellion.  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp; I don’t button my cuffs. Buttoning cuffs are for the un-inspired. People who button their cuffs are basically just giving in to the Mullahs of corporate convention. What, will I get flogged if I don’t cuff my buttons, so what if I wear a French cuffs shirt but disregard the cuff links? What then, what will your fashionista gestapo do then? Nothing that’s what? Nothing  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp; My Chipped tooth – There’s nothing more ghetto than a guy missing an eight of his front tooth. I’m keeping it street yo!  &nbsp;  I didn’t even get into the fact that my wristwatch looks like I took it off a dead midget gimp with a crystal meth addiction that I saw/touched/smelled&nbsp; in a dark alley…and maybe it is best if we don’t revisit that topic again. Even the punk in me don’t need no jail time.

         Evil     &nbsp;  I want to be David Blaine. I watched his old magic special, "David Blaine: Street Magic," on The Learning Channel yesterday. It reminded me that I want to be David Blaine. I want to be famous. I want people to be captivated by me. I want to levitate and have girls on the street freaked out by my magical powers. I want to make random people's clothes disappear. (And I'm not talking about you, Mr. Shoulders. Calm down.)    &nbsp;  I thought to myself, What's with this obsession for fame? For attention? What is going on here?    &nbsp;  I will tell you what... and I told my shrink the same thing... the happiest times of my life were when I was a kid and had a cold and my mom would take care of me and make me feel better. Unfortunately, I was a relatively healthy kid, so I really didn't get that kind of attention so often. Why couldn't I have had juvenile diabetes? Or lukemia? Damn, some kids have all the luck. This is why I turned out so messed up.

         Evil     &nbsp;  It has come to my attention that I am now within striking distance of having posted the most words on this blog! Here is the current count...    &nbsp;  Me: 24,327   Xtian: 24,650    &nbsp;  And that's not counting THIS post!    &nbsp;  Because my life is essentially empty, I need to engage in absurd competitions to keep me going. As such, I am devoting myself to overtaking Xtain. Whatever it takes!    &nbsp;  Tomorrow, I am playing golf with Kentaro. I will probably post a hole-by-hole recap of my round. "Hole 14, third stroke... there was a slight wind behind my left shoulder... 147 yards to the pin and I was feeling confident with my 7 iron..."    &nbsp;  You will be bored to tears, but see if I care!

         Evil     I am not kidding, this might be my last post due to death. The fire alarm came on in my office building. But then the fire marshall got on the speaker system and said "Do not be alarmed. We have a smoke condition on the second floor, but it's under control. Do not be alarmed."    That was two minutes ago. I am waiting for him to get on the speaker again and say, "Do not be alarmed. We have a smoke condition on the 9th floor, but it's under control." Dude, I am on the 21st floor. If the smoke condition get above double digits, I am jumping out the window and taking my chances.    PS - If I die, someone please manage my estate. My baseball cards should be sold on eBay, except for my Don Mattingly 1984 Topps rookie card, which should be buried with me. That's the extent of my estate. Not too much work, so please don't screw this up!

         Evil      THE HOSE BBQ     I'm taking a short break from the intense planning session to tell you all, our loyal readers, about the upcoming The Hose BBQ. I'm telling you, XTIAN and I have been up day and night putting this together. It's not going to be like any BBQ you've ever been to before.     Our first order of business is figuring out how we can get Sleeve the hell out of town so we can use his rooftop deck. After kicking around various ideas, we concluded that luring the kid out of town is just way too much effort, not to mention, way too unpredictable. This BBQ need to go off without a hitch. So the going plan is to tie that sucker up, gag him, and stick him in his own closet for the duration of the BBQ.     Now, with that out of the way, let me highlight for you what it means to throw a BBQ, The Hose style...      Hooker Pinata  - Because our readership consists mostly of angry males, we'll have a hooker and a whiffle bat. In no way are we condoning violence against women, but you put two and two together. I personally will be too busy working the grill to care what the hell you do.      Sausages aplenty  - In addition to being angry, our readership generally is withholding a lot of homoerotic angst. Therefore, when you find me at the grill, you can be sure that I'll be roasting nothing but sausages and weiners. This is all for your enjoyment. You should thank me.      Roofies on the Roof  - One of the funniest things I ever heard was how one of the authors on this blog (who shall remain nameless, for obvious reasons!) went and drugged himself with roofies. Imagine that, trying to date rape yourself. But anyway, while said author is tied and gagged in his closet, we will raid his roofies stash and dump it into one of the punch bowls. We will try to label the bowl correctly although I can't guarantee anything because XTIAN is in charge of that and I can't even count on him to use readable english in his emails.      Live webcast  - For those of you who can't make it to the BBQ or are too afraid for your physical safety to show up at such an event, there will be a live webcast. However, please note that the webcam is be place down my pants. Again, this is for your enjoyment.     Lastly, I'm happy to announce that The Hose BBQ will be a family event. That means Future Wives are invited, including my own. (The Future Mrs. Evil -- where have you been? I haven't seen you since your birthday party!!!) Additionally, the new puppies of Future Wives are also invited. Younger brothers are also invited, in fact, strongly encouraged to attend, so that when we make fun of you, others have something to point to and laugh.     Please RSVP to thehose@gmail.com.

         Evil   &nbsp;  I'M LOOKING BUT IT SEEMS SO HARD TO FIND  &nbsp;  People, I need to become famous. Not just any type of famous. I need to be in entertainment. Hollywood. I've been looking for my launching pad to fame. I checked on craigslist and didn't find it listed. I checked on eBay, but it wasn't for sale. I Googled for it, but no results. For every day that passes and I'm not famous, the world is missing out on my uplifting humor. Not to mention that my penis is missing out on some uplifting T&amp;A.  &nbsp;  Will someone give me a show on TV already? I mean, how many cracks at TV shows is Ahmet Zappa gonna get? John McEnroe? He has a show now. C'MON! You have GOT to be KIDDING ME! ARE YOU SERIOUS? That guy hasn't been relevant since my pre-pubescent days. Back then, my sister didn't have boobs and now she has a kid. The world is changing and I think the world is ready for Evil.  &nbsp;  What would Evil do in entertainment, you ask? Well, I am multi-talented. Next to me, Wayne Brady looks like a singing and dancing clown who sold out his identity to entertain the white people of America. Oh wait...  &nbsp;  First of all, I could have a late night talk show. Sort of like Conan O'Brien (self-conscious, awkward humor) meets Beavis &amp; Butthead (un-self-conscious, awkward humor). I could also have a nationally syndicated cartoon strip. Has anyone seen the cartoon section lately? There are about 35 different strips, but you'd only recognize three of them. Now that I think of it, I can't even remember which three those are. Go pick up a paper and check it out. You'd be dumbfounded by the crap that's in cartoon these days. My cartoon will be about our hero, Evil, and his gay sidekick Xtian. See? It's both ironic and un-ironic at the same time. Genius. I should also have a recurring column in Details magazine. Sort of like Davis Sedaris, except that I don't suck cock.  &nbsp;  Hollywood execs, I am your next big find! Drop me a note (  urlLink  thehose@gmail.com   ) and let's make something happen.

         Evil      THE BEEF WITH KOBE     I don't know what to make of Kobe Bryant. As expected, the news came down this morning that the Lakers had traded Shaq and even though all parties deny it, everyone knows it's because Kobe wanted Shaq out. Ok fine. There was also the firing of Phil Jackson. Most people generally accept that Kobe was pulling the strings here. Me me me. That's what everyone's saying about Kobe. Oh, and after all this, Kobe might actually bolt and go play for the Clippers. He even wanted the Clippers to play some games at the Pond in Anaheim, closer to his house. Everyone's saying that Kobe is selfish.     And oh, one last thing... this guy is still on trial for rape. At the end of the day, he might end up in the slammer.     But here's what I don't get. How did all this happen? Two years ago, Kobe was squeaky clean. Remember? Huge success story of a kid coming out of high school and making it in the league. People liked to mention how he was raised in Italy and speaks fluent Italian. And when he got married -- especially because he was young -- people said that Kobe was a good family man and not interested in chasing ass at various NBA cities around the country.     I've concluded that PR is a fickle bitch.

         Fundits    Since returning (triumphantly) to NY, people have been recognizing me on the street and approaching me. After asking for an autograph, exposing their genitals and occasionally urinating on me, they start asking me questions.  The most prevalent question has been something like this   “Yogi Xtian, how would you describe the Hose?”   I never have a solid answer. I mean who can describe a blog maintained by 3-9 random people all failing to push their respective agendas both online and in their personal lives? Its very difficult you should try it some time.    Well, the other day it hit me. I was reading a NY Times article about VH1’s new programming for the month  I Love the 90s .  Mo Rocca (a genius and someone I myself once tried to pee on in central park) termed himself a “fundit”, a fun pundit! Brilliant! That’s us exactly. We, the contributors of  The Hose  are, are Fundits! We are not Michael Ian Black from  The State  but rather Michael Ian Black from  urlLink  Best Week Ever ,  fitting snuggly on the comedy spectrum between Sharrod Small and Miss Info.   (Miss Info btw, recently revealed on Hot 97 that Janet Jackson has two kids and they’re like teenages! What!? Who? When? I need proof! Who has some?)  Anyway, we’re fundits and that jives very closely with the goal Evil and I recently hatched. Our goal for Q3 is to kick it up a notch on  The Hose  and take ourselves to the next level. What does that mean here? It means a couple of things  (1)	Consistently higher quality humor -  Everyone has to take it up a notch, people like Manolo have to progress past the macho man, latin lover routine and take to the next darker level, like a sexual predator in clown make up or a gay shampoo specialist whatever works for you Manny, follow your instincts. (2)	Media Relations – Starting this week, all death threats, media inquires, hate mail and dirty picture should be sent thehose@gmail.com Hopefully we can create a deeper level of interaction with you, our reading audience of 7. VH1, if you need me, Evil, Sleave, Buckethead or (lord knows why) the Bumpasaurus to appear on Best Fortnight Ever or I love 2003 please don’t hesitate to hit us on the email.  (3) Greater reliance on you our customers. If all seven of you evangelized  The Hose  just enough to get us one more reader we would then have...you guessed it...14 readers, that in this hyper segmented market of entertainment options would put us in front of a fresh new episode of  urlLink  Summerland   or  urlLink  North Shore    in terms of eye balls. Some people have been very successful in using pressure techniques. KenTak 3 has apparently forced his girlfriend, Dr. Susan Calvin to read  The Hose  under threats of leading a robot uprising. I'm not saying everyone should go to this extreme, I am just sharing what has proven successful.  Evil and I are planning to have a Hose BBQ, and everyone's invited. We're just waiting for a weekend when Sleave is out of town so we can use his roof deck in peace.   Ok, I’m going to go figure out what the deal is with Janet Jackson and her 16 year old daughter.

         Long-Time Poster, First-Time Reader     I was listening to NPR this morning while I was driving to work and they were talking about the 15th International AIDS Conference.  I know this is a serious topic but for some reason I couldn't stop giggling like a little Puerto Rican schoolgirl abducted by her 6th grade teacher...  Perhaps it was because they kept mentioning BangKok and THAIland in the same sentence...Who knows?  Perhaps I am bad person but I think I will have exhibited the same childish if somebody kept talking about Lake Titicaca....hahahaha! You just said Titi and Caca!!! hahahaha!

         Manolo's Communist Propaganda    I have gotten (or rather the Editor has gotten) some messages which have voiced grave concern regarding my posts and the direction to which I seem to be taking the Hose.  I will like to express my sincerest apologies as my intention is not to offend anyone.  I am just a very forthright individual and feel very comfortable discussing all sorts of topics in its nitty gritty...  Nevertheless, I have decided to tone it down a bit...for everyone's benefit...  So last night I had this young woman over and after "watching a movie" we did the old cuddling in the arms bit...Anyways,  all of a sudden she blew raspberry noises in my tummy...what am I? A three month old baby...  Therefore, I felt compelled to execute a pre-emptive strike and kicked her out my place...If she felt comfortable blowing raspberry noises, what would prevent her at a later date from biting my ass or for that matter, sticking a finger up my...?  Woooohhhhhh

         Shaving of the balls?    I consider myself a considerate lover...I am always aware of my surroundings and I try to pick up as many signals and cues as possible. I also try to be as discreet as possible.  For example, when I am giving oral pleasure to a girl and a "p" hair somehow makes it way to my mouth, I casually get rid of it.  You will never know I was choking to death...In the other hand, when a chick gets a "p" hair in their mouth, they make a big production of it. Sometimes it sounds like a cat trying to get rid of a hairball...And its not like I am Chewbacca or something...  Anyways, I am currently contemplating shaving my balls...is that something the kids are doing in this day and age or is that too metrosexual? Is that outright gay? Not that there is anything wrong with that...  P.S.- Anybody excited about the new Andy Dick show "The Assistant." That show is going to kick "The Apprentice" out of the water...

        Evil   VH1, WHY NO LOVE?  Still no contact from anyone at VH1? Are they playing hard to get? Is my advertising campaign not working?  I'm not discouraged though. I saw this stat today:     Wow, look at all the self-absorbed people out there. Almost 4 out of every 10 people will search for themselves on a search engine. Sooner or later...
